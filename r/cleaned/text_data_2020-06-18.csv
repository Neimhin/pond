0,2020-06-18," potential thousands deaths could cause (along dozens already caused) acceptable collateral damage? probably know answer better serological antibody data. Illinois Governer ordered shelter place fairly early March 20, think 2nd 3rd state so. Restaurants still closed indoor seating phased reopening plan. 

Because actions, Illinois seeing lowest number new cases 5 populated states really wide margin.

Until pin % pop actually got infected, know strains deadliest. Likely little. world wide pandemic announced theres little anyone stop adopting draconian measures. 

People want blame Trump anything. Really lay feet PPE early months wouldnt stopped many deaths. thing think person could done solo national policy regarding nursing home mandatory daily testing caretakers admittance new residents. bigger impact everyone infect anyways. Many want hide possible infection employer. literally making political issue mandating it. mean come don’t think anyone really knew lockdowns would play see Asia Europe blueprint eradication following Cheers bud, let's make America fair once. Depends situation in,but generally masks low scientific effect social distancing observed. Dude, WTF?

I proof 5G slept wife. 

Don't ask see tho, believe me. example, years people switched fat-free low-fat foods bad science time told right thing do. Butter, horrible natural fat , substituted much healthier trans fat margarine  science  Obesity skyrocketed course, we've moved past that. top this, look bad health science, breakfast important meal day (funded Kelloggs course) examples.

&amp;#x200B;

They move trans-fats, moved sugar. goal eat less fatty foods fat general but, food without fat tastes bad, everyone started eating sugar. Later ""confirmed"" junk science claiming sugar fine. reality sugar-is-fine studies huge problems data, statistical analysis financing.

Luckily science worked debunked. Mostly. still get fuckton sugar food buy. someone wants feed biases, proves science work. qed.

&amp;#x200B;

p.s. Also, (too much) fat indeed bad. WW2, noticeable decrease heart attacks among men, remember correctly. One reasons use much fat cooking. rate heart attacks increased war. always, much one thing always bad. mean... it’s like anyone needs anything make Trump look bad. take verbatim you. Incredibly interesting. wonder follow this. According U.N. Global starvation numbers expected double due measures taken stopping spread covid. That’s 265 million Lmao Jesus, hear self you? amount smugness just... Man could power whole city smug attitude.  Politifact neutral. I'd say pro-establishment. u/JoeRoganExperience are, ever since China lied numbers bought masks, respirators, medicines world blinded lies. 

Then shipped us nice new masks, defective worth shit. 

So yeah. Still little short masks. Thanks. Can’t believe basic ass shit news. stupid country asinine leadership. I’m mistaken, second half quote “. . . TERMINATE YOU!” agree. spread came largest market Asia they’re trying say came food instead asymptomatic individuals seems obvious given crowd. wonder anyone believes this. *Kenyan-American president. universe infinite, are. can't right clearely *me*. u/Govschwarzenegger always champion common sense human decency. called banana republic.

Hey, tourist season, let's magic virus away!

We want scare Germans brits away. also want extend expanded unemployment even though plenty jobs rehiring people laid off, jobs reopening period people laid off.  could make less obvious posting places besides things related china. smart lol Sorry, didn’t learn South Park quotes medical school. Also, I’m 15 South Park really radar. think complete lockdown would require trusting government idea wtf think complete lockdown is. first comment literally orangeman bad comment. automod term orangeman cause never contributes meaningful useful discussion. shared airspace, really choice. still think voluntary. People dumb wear stupid shit face can't breathe through. Concessions keeps doors open, theaters see 30 percent ticket sales There's million ways government could secured PPE hospitals directly supply chain, blaming public like hospitals going local CVS masks plain shitty. 

What think happened, T. &amp; co. wanted set narrative nothing wrong, want people wearing masks, said ineffective. Thanks Arnie. legit gotta fucking idiot shit first place. Like, oh dunno... Germ theory? chance catching outside pretty low. I’m assuming talking rural Chicago’s killing Sadly, local sheriff probably something say this... hell get test? test people sick enough hospitalized here. There's one OK Saturday. really hope super spreading event, but... take put  think debate? You’re stating fact, you’re stating opinion. It’s even opinion fact. It’s opinion people’s feelings. would go proving you’re right someone’s feelings different claim? shoulda said it’s want buy overpriced popcorn seen sub? Anyone doesn’t wear mask 24/7 spreader. want know fitness buff like Arnold worth like 400 million can’t purchase gym lol. money I’d lifetime fitness myself. I'm huge movie fan actually love theater ( minus overpriced food) see stepping theater well year used one favorite weekend past times. Yeah, long density people low sunny out. God works mysterious ways. Oh it’s jab US healthcare. know study Italy showing like 70% people caught 60 showed symptoms. believe us somewhere around 10-25mil infected already.  

I don’t believe overrun system. know doctors better success treating throwing people straight vents. also know vents PPE longer large concern. 

My concern ultimately would recalculate virus say 8-9 months year. case never get back normal true vaccine. 

On flip side virus mutate something akin common cold become extremely weak?  

Will interesting watch. made smirk (; people say want, believe capable posting youtube links Working Pizza place Id wager 99% employees age 35. Likely mortality rate .05 lower. Bro. feel Arnold Schwarzenegger thank you? map looked like since beginning. sure what's going on. much really know him? actor too- acting like know something dont. addresses point how? America. Good luck all. Completely u related I’m watching Total Recall looks old photo... saying something did?   man's gotta fucking moron's gotta do. live MS COVID website worked fine months, past weeks keep ""technical issues"" delaying count updates used every morning set time. frustrating issues inconsistent updates happen fall need watching effects reopening like most. Small govt. Local control!

Except want.

The us loves democracy long form like. Otherwise make due military dictators. look south America. agree. require trusting government. nation ready that. lost 50k 10 days maybe wouldn’t 120k right now. thanks. Anti Drug commercial gave enough trauma.  Nice double fines anyone state. Burr murdered it, too. great. Podcasts great format dude quick-witted Burr. Exactly, people different ideas means ""live it."" come day hearing virus every day, we're lockdown time, there's need masks social distancing, wont think gather without worry, people still get virus die may need booster shots. people think ""learning live it"" means we'll lockdown rest lives that's absurd. think care consulate employees....they follow political wind... care anything else three populated states; California, Texas, Florida good news face masks one day!!! 

This actually feels like might turning point public policy mask usage. really hope trend continues. go Hilton head island South Carolina measure work. hundreds people saw (on vacation- crowded around shirt shops riding bikes etc) saw single mask worn worker. Majority state/New York plates too. 

Domestic tourism appears time high. don’t think ever seen many tourists visiting part Hilton Head 9 years living area. It’s like want pretend it’s happening, businesses taking precautions. *November  
   one side aisle collective brain rot.  I'm skeptical people know medical field say inflating numbers get bigger budgets. Makes skeptical AF. point believe anyone. Kept alive far. 3 months 0.5 percent persons average life span.

This true die 50. see incorrect mask usage daily, invalidates “protection” claimed give.

All way get people shopping spending money again. Mask benefits pales comparison staying home , social distancing checking people fevers.

It’s feel good measure really pointless juncture. didn’t use gym weren’t enforcing mask rule. delete comment, see comment history. one removed comment automod 15 hours ago nothing alleging. fact popular science studies twist statistics much finding actual good research getting difficult layman clickbait headlines help. 5g Bill Gates hurr durr. Bill Burr shut real noticed no, think say ccp bunch assholes. alter original point though. sure thing perfectly acceptable tell someone stfu immediate reaction anything partisan. Yep. Hes ready retire. son bitch, Jingle Way fantastic movie! appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* one party can't named else comment gets banned political. That's how. anti science one. cant wait 2021-2022 year, like god, 2020-2021 year looking like gonna shit. lot morons. Firstly, france say it. french doctor ***claimed*** it

Secondly, claim bullshit. based ENTIRELY radiological imaging found among hundreds looked through. can't diagnose someone COVID simply radiologic imaging time known COVID. 

He test people's samples, looked x rays old pneumonia patients claimed COVID. lot diseases cause ground glass opacity. 

Third, remember french doctor found case france december? still released genomic sequence. means results questionable aswell. 

Both cases false positives. course release scientific article, walk back claims. make shit media eat it. least reason versus ""assholes"" want go bar drink lol. willing die cause others wont even wear mask help prevent spread. Whats selfish inconsiderate telling disproportionately effected race stop crying lynched gunned government literally acting like pandemic blaming protesters memorial day caused new surges. Whats hurting black people system. think people enjoy getting tear gassed shot rubber bullets even demonstrate peacefully? sound like ASSHOLE lol. likely Arizona. fair, theres lot bad science going on. Fix shit. blame experts lying onset squandering important weapon - credibility - politicians prioritize stock value human lives. It’s like limited amount blame clusterfuck. I’d love go somewhere brief vacation can’t justify adding problem. I’m much sitting beach can’t activities safely, I’d rather go somewhere sit. wondering. Seems bizarre value people’s businesses life all. People always want go based gut instinct.

My sister recently got new puppy training like always have...with negative reinforcement. try tell ""hitting dog **only** serves make *you* feel better moment. teaches dog next nothing distrust you.""

Then give evidence. tell time went trainer dog pretty much *only* advocated positive reinforcement, hands-down. that's norm dog-training community. People hit dogs \[anymore\]. Dog show people little different...

&amp;#x200B;

But no. ""This always worked I'm going it"". Okay. Despite fact no...it never worked. always find something complain every single dog had.

&amp;#x200B;

This simple example, absolutely part everyone's decision-making process. feels comfortable. feels right. science cold emotionless.

&amp;#x200B;

As science teacher definitely kids see point science all. However, seems lately (in past 2-3 years) taught lot students *curious*. want know more. questions asked waste time. probably go field science, least dismissing outright. literally cherry picking piece sentence rest would wreck 'rebuttal' 

i wish surprised buy 20th anniversary deluxe remastered HD blu-ray holiday classic Jingle Way! problem seeing ""sides"". virus give shit think believe. Everyone potential vector. county county map. seems like everyone's done virus want move on. virus done us.

noice maskhole, wear mask can't guarantee 6 feet Glad work calling back work next week everything spiking I’m high risk. stupid. love job want support workplace however it’s worth dying for. lung capacity already significant lower be. Dude, seriously dumb enough compare climate change, clear facts data, gender, concept human consciousness easily measurable probably try learning sometime look less like idiot. Make website people snitch. Photos person public added database, fine imposed ever ID'd tied photos positively. Make citizens watchers.  

The idea get photographed people uploaded government database deterrent enough even without fines. let unionize tell you. Noe Valley represent :) BIG FACTS

Polarized idiots forget things transcend politics. kill people Bay Area - kids sports teams started (huge teams practicing hours together), people decided reason wear mask (in East Bay), huge number people going Target stores, bringing kids, hanging hours bored. Plus spreading work sites hospitals along. friend baby hospital gave mother baby COVID19. Ohio here. confirm know cars heading Myrtle Hilton Head. Much would love beach, doesn’t feel like right time yet me. a,m aware poverty line is. No, doesnt sauce approved, cant find are. leads believe scam I'm honestly going downhill 4 month mark, responding well steroids bunch tests coming up. resting lot fighting good fight Gang gang yo. feel you. Oh yeah definitely lead that! found nothing say makes difference though, give early. choice much influence. Well lots things theatres show besides new releases. right whole thing looking good. lose-lose - packed theatres spread this, prudent public keep movie theatres afloat... Sin City getting comeuppance. n95 thing China supply/world demand issue. Clorox thing? Well hoarding certain extent definitely usage supply chain that’s geared JOT unexpected. Yes. think wouldnt be? wealth inequality means 1000 people equales 1 lobbiest. easy proposition article says expect vaccine soon, mentioning HIV example decades effort, yet defeated.. Yea fathers grandfathers kept saying shit gotta deal everything Arnold Schwarzenegger backing masks pretty hard:  always crazy many anecdotes bad flu comes time this. really shit luck make wonder Ugh. Shut up. reopening metrics referring to? Actually, no. county health department authority shut businesses present health hazard public. Usually used fleabag restaurants, ones serve rat poop cockroaches food, technically speaking authority shut business health hazard. 

In county, health department ordered businesses require masks. Given cost money they're shut down, local sheriff willing enforce order, thus far every business I've entered enforced mask requirement.  4 5 Minnesota. viruses volition target.  Citations $1,500 well name address made public social distance offender. Virginia would like word. Kentucky Appalachia, they’re something else doubling rate 3 days absolutely ludicrous, rate would say would infected month ago. 

Other sure point Fully rollback? Yes.

The positives outweigh negatives, society ""assfucked"". Kids get back school. People get back work, inasmuch possible. Hospitals easily treat non covid issues. many positives, impacting 10s, 100s millions people. 

And uncomfortable stay home choose risk valuation. incredibly level head shoulders, keep diligence safe &lt;3 ICU nurse cousin says hospital they’re speculating patients intubated won’t live 5 years due destructive lungs. too. I'm Michigan we've come side hell. It’s time let go. talk serves distraction. need entirely focused mask acceptance. Lives stake. Bay Area here. Shocking many people quickly gave masks walking around town. Plus kids sports team started up. Putting 30 kids together close contact - could go wrong? mean tbf ya’ll thing going...like, you’re brand haha. Suffolk County, NY website hasn’t updated since 9th! HIV completely incomparable anything else, also death sentence anymore. Someday maybe figure well, I'm sick baseless comparisons. May 25th always send shivers spine. thought would never see grandma again. wish didn't. can't seem find now. recall official DHEC website, know was. I'm gonna keep looking [NY Times high quality? exactly. problem much cultural.

I think pandemic brought often overlooked realization front center, realization parents children intention raising providing sort meaningful structure home. Instead parents expect teachers provide standard curriculum, also going raise children them. they're forced raising children, there's massive push re-open schools parents cannot ""handle"" around children assisting education. What’s point? American Airlines children required wear masks anyone take mask eat drink, everyone does. breathe, air gets circulated around cabin... flying fucking mess. airlines really wanted responsible would put empty seat passengers, would less profitable. Chicago 2nd known case US. entirely surprising. see point agree. husband try convince him. happening California?

We high number Chinese people here. SF alone 30% Chinese, many connections (family) China.  

It's bad California huge number people bring virus directly China early on. flights directly Wuhan.  COVID community. slowed spread lockdown, spreading fast rate. started many cases, makes sense kept spreading spreading quickly people give careful.  

Also, many LA region people idiots, careful. elderly playing soccer leagues? feel pain. parents Arizona. Whatever is, probably shopping.  Maybe achieved herd immunity then. still doesn’t follow plan stalling reopening backtracking state still showing increasing trend two week span. shouldn’t wait like Florida something. need worry numbers. That’s little bit like said two months ago won’t issue stay home hospitals bombarded like NY’s (dramatic, point stands). anything, it’s causing people around state become careless. People caring less making less effort day, thinking yes, hoax. Carelessness put us Florida territory aren’t careful. sounds like deadly combination. What's next June 20th ""No Mask Day""--a day mask protest fuckwits. even Nebraska, listen Todd &amp; Tyler daily. Nobody wears mask. governor like that, makes sense. strip 10 days ago. Shit show tourists giving fuck. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  right here. Im manager restaurant set pick window plexiglass, signs saying wear mask come window, would say half do. much want enforce way, im really comfortable making crew stand ground customer thats already agitated wanting argue straight get rowdy it. things like order pay ahead time letting people dine yet get people inconvenienced get huffs puffs, masks become whole nother thing certain group people seem think constitutional right buy pizza regardless wearing, neglecting constitutional right private business deny service following procedures. people think allowed deny gay couple wedding cake, cant deny service 'mUh RiGhts!'. normal circumstances kick dude wearing freaking shirt, sudden im kind oppressor asking dumb ass wear mask maybe hopefuly day everyday get sick. Might reason test results stayed low. never thought I'd glad live Illinois. government locked needed to, mandatory masks, slowed phased reopening, continued drops numbers. feel everyone states we've seen bad get, guys even trying. Sweden managing phenomenally, less 6000 deaths 4 months lockdowns

Now compare rest scandinavian nations log internet  ends justify means. Lol, yeah, that's little dark. Wot Lol want to. Private businesses apparently allowed make whatever rules want comes public safety.  would thought virus targeted vulnerable would reflected death statistics? Water wet.  Demographics makes minority now. 

This aint '68 WND  Chicago strain potent less? Yes he's pretty consistent despite next Trump. Don’t think it’s wise rely speculations cannot verified. prevention still better strategy? Jaywalking is. Dont worry, tigers class know cover mouth sneeze think police looking people wearing masks.

but someone deliberately wearing one enforce give every opportunity leave area put write ticket.

the law meant people obey asswipe. walking around one around neck nobody near you, fined. common sense.  lol you’re exact type idiot falls shit. thrive rhetoric buzzwords filter big words actual substance lot people seem get good chunk money voting power Florida come born raised Floridians, state's best interest mind. vacation spot want keep tax-less simple can. 

They want pay school taxes kids go here, improve infrastructure roads beach house fine. right respectful continue give shit us future generations pay price ignorance selfishness. You’re welcome. It’s recent one is... least recent one could find DHS.gov. It’s brilliant comprehensive plan. gets terrifying go worst case scenarios avoid thing mitigate worst cascades them. Educating public comprehensively country one community big one, it’s happened. fact, what’s plan hasn’t happened. 

Let know think! sog amoi ""Oachkatzlschwoaf"". couldnt shut take vacation 14 days.

And anyone says couldnt blah, blah, blah.

Its totally working everyone way huh? Nope. it’s medical issue. It’s political issue. saying it’s medical issue, doesn’t make political one? smoking lol will. final destination Tulsa rally. Well-being zero sum game. it’s good must bad me. That’s mantra many Americans seem believe in. wearing mask good community must bad individual. thing admire Joe though capacity change views. think would come around someone (like Arnold) explained things reasonable it. going die hill, going pee little. admitted lied us masks going accuse people anti science? People trusting government telling especially admitted lied. annoying trying hang fame. know, period right WW2 scientists hailed heroes, even famous magazines got photographed like superstars? happened though? area flooded people public without masks along many strangely extroverted, wanting come within 6 feet other...

Our region increasing cases (obviously), halted reopening local economy — large one — ‘until things improve.’
We lower financial-classes also manipulated basically racist, instead focus reality problems across financial classes virus. 

The poor suppressed put odds other, extremely wealthy jerks force economy reopen. Isolating making money expense others, blah blahh.. 

So yeah people need wear masks let’s tax heck wealthy, afford it. ""I'm gonna wear sunscreen that's manly, I'll get skin cancer *like man*"" 
/s implied necessary unfortunately Link? start people contacted, also likely transmissions. probably get touch 90% transmissions contacting closest 10% contacts. make difference.

Yeah fuck helping others protecting community! Don’t treat me!!! Get errrrr done! ""state health officials Thursday announced 593 new known cases COVID-19 55 additional deaths, bringing total number known cases 134,778 death toll 6,537 statewide.""

That 4 months.

Those terrible numbers, still problem there. 
Unless think big infection numbers good thing, yes guys fine.

I mean Arizona jumped 1500 2600 cases span 2 days.  like Dumbass think arnold 50 today ran governor california, would probably democrat. republicans 20 years ago ran still respectable. last 8 years so, they've become totally corrupt laughing stock party. think arnold could republican today. would toe party line many lies abuses probably couldnt even sleep night. take little serious Even working vaccine still go human trials typically takes quite  

Rioting. really essential stripper sits lap effort give hard sell buy lap dance Yeah, cases Italy resulted exponential spread end December, produce around 3000-6000 cases first week Feb, wind 30 people dead end Feb.

Given monitoring obviously poor back then, also likely dead tracked, would push index cases back bit further.

Then due [low dispersion virus probably trickling index patients fizzled mid-Dec.

Still we're talking late-Dec Italy here. Everyone thread thinks caught Dec (or earlier) understand exponential growth.

And yeah looks like [detection wastewater highly find infection rate 5-10 per 100,000. headline may indication one cluster dozen people late Dec Italy. conservative uncle thinks Fauci fraud I'M sheep XD

I gaslight time since know can't change mind. Spoken like a...... doctor??? Yeah that’ll goto stop wearing masks.  Sorry hear that. [Link Starts 5 minutes.

It's worth watching Bill's delivery 3 minutes long. February hardly getting know virus. research said masks partially protect contracting virus. weeks progressed, better understanding virus. found wearing mask prevents people shown symptoms spreading virus. method population decreases risk high infections whelming hospitals. overall purpose mask protect others getting infected infecting people show symptoms. don’t need specifications know everyone wearing sort masks would help? Even 1% added protection, would rather say fuck it? would rather hurt others reason “I don’t want wear mask it’s uncomfortable...” That’s reading quotes someone works. moron proving wrong slowly. saw guy grocery store wearing mask “test, trace, isolate” printed it. covering nose. 30-60 hospitalizations per day June. bud. equal respect opinion.

From Canada, absolute moron look like joke dude! Sorry, sorry. possible incubation like 2 months instead 2 weeks many people? SICK STRAW MAN BRO. 


The irony lot people mindset flag waving false patriots cream America WW2. I'd love see selfishly subset would react needed nationwide rationing again. 


Individual sacrifice made country great deserve benefits self-centered. agree this. feeling get saw coming everyone reopened way early coupled many taking seriously... sucks.

But sucks even feeling headed summer especially winter. 

We truly real chance get ahead beginning chance wasn’t blown, completely fully blown apart again.

But really, besides watch unfold, extra safe, short market there’s way hell stocks going hold steady states deal massive level. Joe pretty smart though. Yeah, think unfair paint reopen crowd entirely irrational selfish. lot people legitimately need get back work pay bills. did, sign required remove.

That alarmist got changed zoom, email ext number. liked Howard Hughes comment. wear Kleenex boxes feet, too? seriously catch feeling way daily, even opening doors using napkin feel strangely germophobic, yet know necessary. voodoo NY state that's actually requiring masks quite now? Yeah, and? think understand point. People trying claim concept wearing masks partisan issue. **New Cases US**

You sir roof friend. Dangle feet edge. Talk jumping. Time goes buy. Still roof. get push friend off. always wondered that. Im curious average education people screaming “MUHFREEEDOM REEE”. It’s even rural America. There’s major county Southern California called Orange County mandatory mask policy roll back cus idiot pterodactyls screaming wearing masks. wonder average education population plays part rational cooperation government orders.

Someone degree behavioral psychology needs study road hicks arms masks. then? Lots animals save can't fix stupid. know dont want dummies die easily preventable virus.

Smart person goes hmmmm live work orange county, seriously doubt people listen. wear mask everywhere go (I admit wear driving though) see half people wearing them. Everything opening well. honestly feel lot people OC smart Good. People 16-18 smart think. So, ok enclosed room people without masks? He's requiring people wear masks pandemic. ok that, stupid is. nothing food drink. Use head. told occupying space? say anything youre able give evidence it. shut up. Thanks making Predator. I’ve got say. blood boiled back February Trump rallies saying “the democrats want politicize virus. It’s big hoax” everyone went “YEAH” zero critical thinking freedom whatever want do. mention massive push mail ballots years election. Let’s push election back one two years see happens. Yep. One idiotic places internet. American population fucking dumb shit refusing wear masks endangerment everyone else, government even need force people wear them. imagine everyone California wore 3 weeks. virus would disappear like miracle. Nah, I've hearing people saying ""I'm tired virus shit"" virus gives fuck feel. shit. Explains exactly Az rising cases. Shit governor stupid people   comment sounds really stupid. state California able achieve authority, yet still legally required parents vacciante children? know based scientific data net-benefit society, direct threat whomever vaccinated everyone around. 

The point question introduce argument vaccinations necessary. like previous response attempt justify idea wearing masks. point clearly acting outside normal precedence think obvious decision State representative, former hollywood actor, wants us believe. 

Just remind folks still reading, thread largely praising representative State demonizing Americans disagree way sees world. ""Normal flue"" Influenza = *same thing* store shop everyone wears masks. Sorry loss. don’t think would consider PPE, especially pandemic, clothing. It’s literally protection device shirt burka. That’s leap insanity friend. I'm sure I'll get downvoted reddit hard-on Arnie but....

Arnold Schwarzenegger worst governor ever run California left state **$16 billion** debt. cut money education give police, lead massive ""Pink-Slip Scare"" 2009/2010. *Americans certain political party

Fixed Something like yeah. Still PTSD dealing bureaucracy. increase testing btw? Pugilist sounds like absolute retard  IgG particular seems antibody actually neutralizing virus (IgM response poor indicated IgA may neutralizing), IgG completely absent blood maintaining significant concentrations mucosal membranes. One oddest phenomenons people flexing face pandemic, wearing mask proves toughness. It doesn’t. 

It proves don’t pay attention, don’t respect science, reject critical thinking, lack working empathy. It’s nothing boast about. thanks watch people throw citations trash refuse pay take cases court go citations thrown out.

Seriously: cannot kind crap United States America human rights Constitution!

They get away overseas Constitution founding document guaranteeing certain rights.

I happen wear mask go way realize mandates infirm legal ground. Yes Except every time enter store. Sometimes feel bit like hippy staring crystals trying divine real store. used old quartz tech though. Liquid crystals much captivating. 1 week spring break enough, apparently 3 much.

Most places got sick waiting. People dying around like old painting plague, gave quarantine went back bar. said back I’m skeptical.

Just looked comment history. *three months straight* saying thing repeat: curve flattened, virus waning, warm weather stop it, etc.

You're relentlessly consistent could replaced bot one would notice. I'm Austrian even though silly probably American Austrian, still sense feeling pride coming everytime stands good cause public. guess, part life ever since born therefore familiar person relate too. wish could run president US. fucking shame happened challenged court law state mandate thrown well.

Seriously: cannot dictate people ""YOU WEAR MASK!"" someone wears mask already CoVid lost parents it!

There thing 'personal freedom' country sorry: Mandating people wear optional clothing item goes far unless talking going hospital somewhere else.

In public general? Sorry: far uber-liberal Maryland resident. Oklahoman reporting.

People got stupid re-opened. 

Coworker said need masks stayed 6 feet apart. Told investing limo could still ride around friends mask-free.

We testing though. Wife went ER March Flu, begged test flu test came back negative. call brother-in-law state residency local hospital get test week later.

Now everyone begging take test &amp; anti-body tests Doctors request. sad masks incredibly cheap effective way slowing spread. seems like people accept masks situation control again, they'll see light. Reopening much worse wearing mask. Yup good thing settled science political issue then; masks know governor right? Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, curve flattened - meaning still high spread society, increasing. curve rising, said needed flattened (stop exponential growth). See graph, example: 

Number active cases definitely gone fast. number deaths steadily (and slowly) gone down, well number people ICU. 

Confirmed cases surged we've finally started testing en masse (literally week, another example gov dropped ball). indicators ICU-data shows number sick decreasing, though happened much slowly, notably Stockholm region. 

None contrary deaths per capital higher countries. also political statement. 

Again, favour government's policy. important accurate. yup, think religious debater ""owns"" academics/atheists method. audience absolutely love it. said mask help prevent spreading least 40%. Get facts right. show articles people’s faith saving dying virus :( Yeah I've tons blood tests access charts still dont know Yeaa buddy, go Arnold. Behind paywall wall can’t read article. Tegnell said misinterpreted saying Swedish model wrong, instead reasoned known back February/March know today, probably would used mix measures used Sweden used places. Exactly measures means don’t know. main overall strategy still believes correct one Sweden.  cannot see previous post deleted it, obvious racism comment say replying to. comment removed incivility, deleted cannot see uncivil was. 

Whether responding comment contains hate speech not, response displays incivility removed regardless. much better approach report comment offended (and may well offensive general) take confrontational approach get removed. punched racist bar, still one got thrown out. authority thing benefit us bad thing? seems like upside *Having authority* 

I addressed this. authority thing benefit us bad thing? slippery slope going lead let this? government able freely *because population large recognizes good thing* Thank link! Really good know. *totally* worth die /s feels like lie. news updates time China manipulating numbers look good. released app allows track rona. Yep, sure. Checks out, seems legit 👍 I'm Asian American. would anything CCP? Saving someone read. blames beef. 

Not great article. 20 citations useless none support hypothesis there's even attempt address potential criticisms.

What's evidence they've done that? Especially given Sweden gone way test much. bit frustrating people move goal post discussion. give credit answering 1 3 questions, ask think educated person equates bad person? 

I see would assume equivalence, simply case. would Plutocracy, quite opposite, empowerment poor, consistent way poverty know of. Higher education problem, solution. Education simply priority states, barriers cost higher education it. change political landscape one prioritizes education, much easier time providing funding children school meals, graduate high school, pursue degree. 

To point, would two suggestions different scales. personal scale, would recommend anyone interested college consider community college, unlike university level, possible work part time job pay way through. Definitely apply financial aid even expect nothing, may surprised. General Education classes honestly core college education anyway, done community college level. 

The second point applies much wider scale, addresses high cost education. Someway other, reverse decision privatize Sallie Mae 1997. Google fun learning major part reason higher education expensive. Plus every time new testing shows fewer people antibodies expected say ""Oh, well testing done 2-3 weeks ago, we're sure much higher now."" friend works hospital Dublin.

Another scenario... let's say go hotspot part job support activities life-sustaining business. Forcing 2-week quarantine return harms (in legal sense) family also life-sustaining business prohibited activities require in-person presence duration quarantine. Which, way, may able without personal contact quarantine actually protect anyone's health. 

I Constitutionally-based ""right free ingress States, egress them."" quarantined stop infecting others. 

The court consider scenarios order, *as written*, would cause undue harm *and* infringe rights. Courts throw laws written broadly.

Jesus...

Its random disease..

Its NAMED one.. 

There are/were reasons letting spread young...

Covid long lasting immunity know tested thousands people crowd tens thousand came contact day can't draw conclusions. [Study Japan says 18.7 times likely transmit He's right must learn science think right combination Sagan said media 30 second sound bites fact seems 1) ignorant find voices amplified. 2) pointed out, there's much accompanying information guide people back towards light.

So still seek out, even Fauci neglects mention soundbite edited out.

Lately, reading ton papers based contact tracing, actually find even scientific voices U.S. make television tend towards alarmism total lack willingness fill knowledge gaps given tv time.

For instance, even MSNBC, playing Fauci's thoughts, they're still showing shots beaches outdoor situations. public transit. offices. one shot empty restaurant. 

Meanwhile, countries realize primarily spread airborne droplets. recent papers confirm this. South Korean contact tracing read lines aspect still FAR robust anything going U.S. papers still referring data given scientists Taiwan, France, Japan, China, South Korea outbreaks necessary context contact tracing.

Even among scientists America, there's extreme unwillingness look make salient recommendations - fall back firehouse approach going anywhere anything cause might get sick. Meanwhile, countries aware work long people start questioning X infectious Y. 

We've long needed layout shows continuum likely transmission starting safer side staying home working way toward dangerous likely maskless, talking singing yelling close quarters, INDOORS, low ceilings recirculated ""dead"", stale air.

Instead, opt Rachel Maddow voice reason, yes, Fauci, course, yelling everyone we're headed second wave without specially calling circumstances, arguing profoundly contact tracing, zero information consensus moved towards airborne transmission rather surfaces. Even CDC subtly change wording transmission account remember even pointed media happened weeks ago.

Does politicizing masks help? No. complete vacuum leadership profound ignorance top help? No.

Could media specifically scientific voices given airtime U.S. use air time wisely actually pointing current science ""in trenches"" analyzing data done worldwide (with odd absence place hit worst)??? 

HELL. YES. 

Meanwhile, offices giant problem reopenings never get mentioned. Churches continue problem media anything take three minutes would take pay diagram graphics show dangerous compared to, say, beach outdoors masks distancing, really creates large enough gap ignorant sew distrust science media create future gravestones. People pushing far. Help make America great sign petition restore rights Americans wear pants shirts. Change.org/letitallhangout convinced coronavirus take siesta went Lancaster County Subaru 2 weeks ago showrooms opened everyone wearing mask, properly too. car arrived Wednesday I'm picking up, we'll see like today think US bad, see Canada housing market. Currently, Canada depends three things economic strength - natural resources, housing, retail services. one either experienced significant collapse 12-to-24 month. least US affordable housing livable areas. 1% people tested positive, that's concerning percentage article makes out. one individual protest may super-spreading event (because super-spreading events happen outdoors), protests could still spreading virus R0 greater 1. mean?

Yes. Still medieval system one proved effective reverse emergency situations. Thanks letting know stance; please feel free continue suppressing calling people are.

And disagree would one thrown bar punching racist, unless bar staffed people would rather rock boat confront actual incivility.

Once again, hope grow current passive paradigm; dangerous one calls say like rather getting root problem. shit. would nice U.S. spiraled far dont think that's option anymore. Lockdowns work. Look Michigan. blew quick 2000 cases day. lockdown early recently ended it. around 100-200 cases day plenty states erupting record high numbers. Michigan actually one states right see huge decrease maintain it. you’re car others you’re wearing seatbelt, you’re gonna ping pong around car, injuring everyone else you’re bad accident. Cool, let inspectors visit Wuhan Virology lab, please :) College start dates many schools moved earlier, too, semester end Thanksgiving. dont think white black.

M America bizarre country. honestly can’t fathom asking people wear mask stop spread virus would controversial, especially they’ve refused socially distance reasons. There’s something extremely wrong large percentage American population thinks. It’s weird. You’d think issues brainer slam dunks can’t tell people trying contrarian rebellious they’re plain stupid. blows every scientific discovery water. quite important point.... there's something COVID spreads different perceived wisdom. know is, clear social distancing, impact, certainly whole story, probably even important factor.

The severity outbreaks seem correlate well stringency social distancing measures. almost governments wanted feel like something, _something_ sounded plausible.

Problem -- no-one really knows factors are. reports coming first protests COVID regards them. check out. Great timing Thanksgiving. otherwise known 'The Last Supper' many elderly. Yeah, hard call Iceland become dependent tourism income. living there, I'd pissed pushing back, say there's lot people lost jobs due lack tourists. black white.

So give shit cigarettes, right?   
I know point is. Telling scientific fact blaming. think going get immunity without antibodies instead get immune response maybe. means people get reinfected infectious others antibody immunity.

Sure, MIGHT fight virus easily second time, also might fight easier would say probabilities point toward idea infectious antibody immunity. now, exactly infectious might vary quite bit depending seriousness infection individual. imagine people impacted coughing biological material probably ones capable spreading average. hug family? Tests cases went scaled testing... agree you. are, however, lot folks wearing masks that's something. OMG I’m ‘justifying anything. I’m telling you’re demonstrating erupt get outraged easily.

If anything, you’re demonstrating exactly can’t trusted make sensible, rational decisions. wholeheartedly support kind gentle shepherding honestly, need it. Hunt, buy local meat.

oh want eat bushmeat. smart. get covid, might get LYME-20. Every coronavirus infection gives immunity while. absolutely reason supposed one magical virus would not. Yeah know fight that? honestly, transparency professionalism.

 entire CDC, NIAID proven incompetent also criminaly dangerous stance masks, tests, ventilators treatement protocols. Instead admitting spent money gain function research instead stock buildups asking people understand donate masks hospitals lie say work 3 months, test tell policy, completely unacceptable.

You want public confidence back, stay consistent quarantine message even riots, develop better protocols US mortality laughable, stop politicizing science design proper Covid19 trials mail self reports, retroactive, start pushing well funded tracking program, economic measures...do need go on? swear god people would stop putting egos public image first would figured now. Hang friend. joking team we'd Lysol bomb upon arrival tempting. Wait, remaster? VHS... world simply ready act responsibly even save lives. type behaviour engraved genetics. Hah. comment funny. don’t ‘trust science’ learn science understand thinking behind it. 

Your issue can’t think yourself. clear everyone except dumbest contingent society hoarding PPE would damaging front line workers yet hoard ‘how trust science’ people chosen ignore advice anyway.

You shit it’s hilarious. You’re making look even stupid blaming government whining ‘trust science’ bull. Tragic. Looking directly Joe Rogan... Fall Rush months away! Seems interpretation word hitting snags. don’t think meaning works. Police enforcement doesn’t mean world crime free.

I think “to add force strengthen”.

So nobody would listen mandate lockdown unless trusted people enforcing still support restaurants getting food delivered you. there's incredibly... know call it, lot people need restaurant ""experience"" sitting table waiting food get presented front someone keep pestering ""is everything OK?"" Masks get sold weekend price skyrocket again. dont manage buy one price u afford, criminal worse Hitler according reddit yeah i’m fucking moron labelled good news? strip malls could convert 25% parking outdoor patios still plenty room, especially right now. Check #BlackFridayParking hashtag Twitter sometime. mean yeah, virus doesnt really care reason is. seem misunderstood. I'm sorry. Finally we're starting get studies need honest data.

There never reason think average antibody lifespan would greater 6 24 months even 24 months means people would lose antibodies 6 months 24-month average. 24 months best possible likely scenario that's studies suggest SARS leaves behind, studies thorough immune response 24 months never actually tested. easy see 24-month guesstimation would little bit lower probability side things.

if like normal common cold carnivirus average antibody lifespan 6 months also means 3 months around half people lose antibodies average antibody lifespans lot variants per individual.

I've trying tell people since January think mostly get downvoted. take little bit data existing corona viruses becomes clear never much likelihood long-term immunity short-lived antibodies could even become problem comes vaccination.

There's way trust reports say vaccine going last 12 months even 6 months one tested enough months yet. saying Texas Man go toe toe Florida Man? time time comments Formula 1, safety killed sport drivers know signed still risk lives someone's entertainment. dont believe helps sleep night says made Italy mask.

I'm used it. kind boring. pay taxes though. new cases new deaths. That's hard believe. Science ruined second marriage, get it. lot people unhappy. also trying look people losing jobs. balancing game.

But first decision made fighting covid taken politicians doctors. eat shit results. america. need celebreties tell feel do. people care much famous people say? hear? Covid19 developed conscience attack BLM protesters. whenever see linear growth assume due testing bottlenecks. happened Wuhan start (and people said due falsely reporting numbers, lol). look daily deaths, it’s true statement. 14 last 15 days 1,000 deaths still trending down. 

If look daily cases, it’s false statement. Overall cases trending slightly upwards. 

Depends point view. Higher cases equal higher deaths according data. Personally think many, many cases reported earlier months, thing around since late 2019. went unchecked March. fuck. need damn nother mutation. Went jail posessions illegal drugs weapons. 45 seconds exercise buff Arnie?

Sweet Crisis actors gullible fool!  like parents dead kids Newtown.  Also, earth flat six thousand years old, Trump election 2016 without help Putin, vaccines cause autism, climate change real definitely born human factors moon landing filmed burbank.

You libtards science evidence.

(wouldn't cool exaggerating?) actually work CUH 👍 But.. but.. poker face ??? Even mortality figure true (estimates vary 0.5-2% depending location, don’t truly know scope asymptomatic infected), choice mask vs 4 1,000 chance dying (or much higher hospitalization chronic complications), I’d wear damn mask.

Also, N95s *are* required TB. That’s make healthcare workers get annual TB screening mask fit testing. outdoor cats destroyed outright vermin. Itll deffinately trumps rallies, protestors week without answer reliable source safely assume OP posting bullshit. I'm surprised. women could keep going host clubs Kabukicho reopened.

Meat factories Western equivalent Chinese wetmarkets. believe president? acknowledges 100000 people died...

The medical community acknowledges this

Refrigerated trucks full bodies points this

Countless families grieving points this

What evidence would convince you? going wait someone know dies. interesting perspective. That's straight-up stupid thing say there's far many months vaccine distributed start effect virus could easily mutate vaccine could easily underperform regardless early reports.

if there's one thing learned project months future virus matter well educated think are. 

There's nobody planet educated enough make predictions like there's education would actually qualify know f*** talking comes new virus pandemic never seen matter even current virus pandemic viruses vary much know really many months hits that's lucky enough take several months figure virus.

Here several months still figured lot mechanics virus, say know vaccine going work lockdowns completely irresponsible. thinl first tome meat plants affected UK. Hopefully cause meat shortage [please don’t forget Hey got feel alive right die right new corona patients Dutch protest Amsterdam, that's good news right?  kind business run People like smoke tobacco.

Icelanders ever right upset this. looked whether accuracy PCR tests improved last months posted this. day user helpfully supplied link: researchers estimated tested SARS-CoV-2 four days infection 67 percent likely test negative, even virus. average patient began displaying symptoms virus, false-negative rate 38 percent. test performed best eight days infection (on average, three days symptom onset), even false negative rate 20 percent, meaning one five people virus negative test result.

I uncomfortable Iceland opening way before, figured they'd play safe. seems not. Tourism makes up, what, 20% economy? More? forget lot. 

I guess figure worth taking risk lives order flood country tourists again. kinda hope Icelanders end kicking big fuss this. seems unreasonably dangerous given inaccurate tests are. Conservative here... side on? 

the way ball game start opening everyone starts wearing masks lowers spread. want ball games got put mask otherwise going look data surging cases think ...heck....everyone put masks ball game made deal!?

if can't put going put ball game.

No deal. Add protesting, Memorial Day parties, Fathers Day July 4th coming up. Plus testing readily available pretty much anyone, wasn’t case 2 months ago. 

My general perception much younger crowd getting tested sick this. Back March/April seemed like upper ages. Well, got attention wanted. Glad he's banned. Here's thing superspreaders social sense: tend interact mostly others category (club goers, church goers, rally goers). sub-population ""potential superspreaders"" gets LOT cases early, drops infected pool. essentially create little herd immunity thing even overall population 5% immune something. viruses herd immunity threshold much less 1-1/R0. Superspreading GOOD news. Unequivocally. fair back hurts still lot shit.

Then times lay floor anything.

EDIT: Nothing proud Didn’t almost 1,200 new cases today? Nah dude you’re correct, Mexicans. like Germany’s financial problems Jews, Boston’s cultural issues Irish, Name-Your-State’s crime issues blacks, HIV’s cause gays, New York’s crime Italians. Want keep going?

The issue lack intellectualism, denial science. Science bias zero political affiliation. 

But hey, know dude! evidence masses 30 years old going hospital COVID insurance.

I never said know getting nonsense from.

I said good understanding co-morbidities uninsured populations still percentage population insurance small - 8.5% nationally. Even assume twice 0-44 cohort, that's still 17% population without insurance.

First, know represents millions people.

But also completely irrelevant. conversation number uninsured Americans. conversation degree comprehensive understanding co-morbidities uninsured Americans. hope, now, see statistic meaningless discussion. There's even less reason believe 80+% population insurance going hospital we've seen almost casualties age group.

Y'all obsessed hospitals weird. 

You realize data co-morbidities routinely collected primary care physician, yes? annual blood work yields data a1c, cholesterol, probably get BP assesed there, too.

It's occasionally collected hospitals necessary care plan hospitals collecting extrapolating co-morbidities people patients. 

And uninsured people go annual blood work preventative care. recognize that, yeah?

So, hope understand problems literally bending knots make arguments kind support want believe. Stop it.

I'm actually health care worker understands data collected used medical research better busy bending knots stopped actually understand post that's spent saying irrelevant things. People learn head perpetually asses trying smell roses, honestly shit far, needs change: systematic racism, untenable financial inequality... Good luck USA, going need 💖 (which sucks, still here... Hoping better... really expecting much... kinda hoping generation going something it, tired amount literal stupid going around. really even functional government point Mobility too. someone near event infected they'll vicinity hours. yells ivory tower crap. think masking factor? r/Masks4All they’d pay bills exactly? government can’t even get second stimulus bill through, people still eat. got bad news you, conservatives. dumbasses everywhere political spectrum, nowhere safe Thats thing, abnormal pneumonia happened lot places, certainly dates Jan since accounts people sub. differenates one place another goverment responded back then. 

In China SARS-motivated disease early warning system ran genetic test abnormal pneumonia samples, thats new virus first discovered. exact time also know people abnormal pneumonia dismissed faulty flu assay everywhere else world without early detection system

Theres already mountain evidence non Wuhan orgin, tell already unspoken understanding research community reference different strains orgin, thing preventing update virus orgin hypothesis politicans wanting shift blame, ironically politicians opposes masks day crap ton ppl dying due ""pnuemonia"" year nonetheless? Yeah, pointing hospital felt sufficient, maybe lady real health condition - everyone else mask on. know aren’t old people groups say it’s anti trump on. That’s amazing deaths consistently going down! good sign. admit though I’m bit skeptical daily deaths zero August, might fairly low stay end summer. hope anyway! going another lockdown lol. Get real. work first time, people allow implemented again. Universe, listening... Wikipedia:

For 2016 specifically, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data shows 37,461 people killed 34,436 motor vehicle crashes, average 102 per day.

So, smoking? COVID chance infect large proportion population yet months way surpassed annual 37k death figure here. Oh fuck sorry Yes hyperbole. however far less hyperbolic idiotic daily tweets, press briefings official statements govt leaders. Telling people self quarantine without enforcement seems pretty pointless they’re American 🤷‍♂️ grandmas lives it’s much trump mask on. really good stance long term health effects getting Covid, especially end hospital ventilator. Recovery ventilator weeks joke. mention potential bankruptcy medical expenses insurance cut-throat insurance tries say half things covered network doctors, etc.... Even insurance ""fully"" covers hospital stay, still $8-10k pocket expenses person allot people make $100k, extra unexpected $8-10k really hurt. Straka gene pool made 2020. Probably much further. 21% population immune least city slow transmission rates. Florida going get wrecked doubt.

And yeah majority Americans concerned health seems. Yet, we're sacrificing economy. words 😶  worry plenty land graves! shortage, cemeteries overwhelmed! Dang, bad. re-read comment responding to. wrong, response absolutely correct, know much anything co-morbidities uninsured (as correctly point out) go hospital. reason though saying know COVID death rates young. 'Twas case slow brain, fast fingers. like delete comment, absolutely will, although think well-reasoned informative response well worth leaving up. guarantee meeting someone said ""It's okay, ones dying already workforce hurting supply human capital stock."" 'Just smile wave boys.. Smile wave.' also cut fucking leg. guy really hanging on. feel like if/when take ventilator, he’s goner. :( isn’t. want control narrative covid big deal econemy stay reopen regardless people get sick die/hospitals get overwhelmed. trump administration cares little people wellbeing clearly focused keeping econemy stick market strong..the way literally downplay covid essentially ignore exsistance..sadly . Automod deleted it. 

Thanks reaching though, interesting discussion. 

My understanding conspiracies definition. im lawyer familiar laws regarding conspiracies. actually used work sociology (am biologist days maybe info date) industry standard describing outgroup individuals found other. 

Once conspiracy revealed, specific group im talking (flat earthers, birthers, anti vax, freakin pizzagate!? etc) give single flying fuck reality truth, acceptance self-defined in-group. impetus obsessions rooted SIDE Therory feeling better society shunned ideas whole life. 

Once upon time used work federal government. First Marines capacities. believe agree conspiracies abound need investigated. mainly trying point 'conspiracy theorists' like facts, enjoy story. 

Because longer theory, instead accepted fact, theyre longwr special knowing REAL truth it. 

Thanks continuing conversation here. 

I'd like know legal side it. Since (I assume) conspiracy alone illegal. mean, tacit plans 'secret' conversation continuing conversation public view. makes conspiracy illegal? Would conspiring something else own, illegal? would take concrete actions towards fulfilling plan idea enough toss somebody cage?

I've read plenty arcane laws written turn screws innocent folks. conspiracy charge similar? read article Reddit moderators describing traits common accounts run Russian trolls. One thing mentioned many username format Adjective_Noun. example Aggravated_Peach. Keep eye names like think someone jackass :) Thats lot words type ""I shit job I'm useless get better one""  We're ones Warp Speed branding. :) There's also theory summer, there's UV radiation outside people also get vitamin may contribute. God shirt say everything what? “I decide I’m problem, you!” Wow that's question. asking large gatherings...

should essentially identify may ask host general questions, ***whether attended large event***, intended elicit information activities close contacts. point, team mentioned, least 1 player issues blood clots previously widely known. NY player diabetes planning return US. They're young, still find risk factors groups meaning avoiding activities. Good lol, companies tell someone GTFO good reasons. Oh irony.

edit: know know ""irony"" means I'll spell you:

You know talking about. Even better retailers caught jacking prices 19%, tax discount driving 'holiday.' People flocked stores pay price always. rate we're going shit we'll hit fan next weekend considered getting online movie streaming business? even offering drive-in movie options? expecting people wear masks theatre there's snacks drinks consumed film going go well. First time read actually applies me. I’m food runner there. looks like someone need future NDA denial for. know who. know for. realize Americans don't. pick choose make sound good. Record unemployment? Nope Dow great. Why? know mortality rates 40 without pre-existing conditions close 0. would cost many lives? understand. fundamentally constrained physics chemistry? so, evolution cannot help tolerate outdoors. Michigan 5 new deaths last 24 hours.  Smart

Edit: Clearly joke, bullshit Esoteric piece Science tell us wear makes. cant imagine going ever case. agree still remember Gove saying ‘Britons enough experts.’ Trying avoid censors one (fourth try):

In last two days seen (R party) officials blame: young, black people, migrant workers. 

Still waiting hear blame for: atheists, straight people, maybe eventually women.

And right says left play identity politics.

Edit: Wow, can't even name groups charge now. much talking honestly country's approach virus policy. ICU figure make sense many new intubations. people reading thread, see perfect example alt-right always try derail topic drive defensive position. zero arguments topic itself. Whenever see happening, dont let alt-right lure vortex topic arguments (in thread switched twice) instead ignore point bad faith style arguing anyone following thread. publicity since day 1. risk/reward ration way favor. cousin Northeast jealous everything reopened Arizona. super bored home think necessary anymore. Well, want live now? really smart offended? comedian called funny name, laughed. agree Rogan, seem smart assume. know still hoax lot people , flu bro feeling less living 2021. Jesus. I've heard stories geology teacher. Sounds horrible radical hypothesis beef causing majority infections. requires lot evidence research everything surrounding beef consumption leaves conveyor belt someone puts mouth article doesnt go things. also ignores fact lot research transmission contact tracing examples people caused majority transmissions. 

It's random correlation without evidence back point. Thank too! Luckily get stay home 99% time. Wouldn’t twist.

I mean he’s actively denying issue, seen, probably hitting church too.

Tick tock. Lol US? 1/10? Florida make weekends longer. That's unusual way spell ""Congress"" like head at.  Global experts contradicted recommendations surrounding mask usage help. Sky-is-falling rhetoric outset come fruition help.
 
People problem undefined time periods - task circumstance. education surrounding masks work, wear properly, wear masks (and may OK to) - importantly - idea long universal mask usage going place (with caveat there's lot moving parts around last one). ain’t complicated. Atmospheric dispersion real. fuck spraying air shit even do? hate lol I’m sorry, you’re right. country deception internal information control told truth made look like ass. Except scientific evidence whatsoever back universal use masks according WHO, exact opposite: use masks nothing political anyone says otherwise moron. can’t get straight answer every antibody study comes later discredited. idea many infected started testing. Hospitalizations deaths remained stable supposed increase cases, doesn’t make sense. I've making custom masks people, several medical conditions work around. made different styles little non-verbal girl autism, whose mother working ramping girl's tolerance mask. made mask breathable cotton woman MS overheating mask. Similar story friend asthma whose old mask breathable enough (his made duck-bill style provide surface area breathe through).

It's funny, legitimate reasons make harder folks wear masks, instead throwing hands they've reaching devising ways make work. activists like this? individuals complain act like child? Case Mortality Rate Florida ~3.56%. 

So expect 100-110 people die next 2 weeks. Hopefully less. think stop saying ""breaks new record!!""

and say ""exponential growth"" start reporting 'doubling time'.

we also say ""florida fucked"". CDC recommends children get two doses MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine, starting first dose 12 15 months age, second dose 4 6 years age. Children receive second dose earlier long least 28 days first dose. Working intended. publicity. he'll run around acting like martyr.

I know I'd differently. hate people think rules apply them, hate idea he'll better selfish prick. labeled domestic terrorist. clearly danger others thinks right spread virus others wearing mask.  statement intended blanket, he's inside since March, whether sufficient levels Vitamin then, I'm sure significantly lower now. goes aswell, inside quite long period, that's take it. 

Even sufficient levels, really difficult unheard reach level toxicity Vitamin D. told him, research using anything. genuinely curious here, much arizona miami dallas two biggest international flight hubs country. wonder could anything massive increase since nyc essentially shut entire time. Houston here. haven’t seen mask someone’s face Clorox wipes sale 2 months. totally fine, could understand meant totally see typo :)  No. Florida count probable COVID deaths like states. Also, death reports Department Health lag month. realistic shutting entire economy?

No one fucking wants indefinite shutdown. ways responsibly open back manner keeps caseload spiking.

I'm sick arguing idiots. What?? It’s definitely studied, ignorance doesn’t mean people aren’t thinking this. Really awful lack smart capable leadership this, combination 30 years “infotainment” news media twisted large swaths population political religionists (treating political parties religion), contempt government general among population, plus low science literacy ugly cultural stew pandemic spread within. know wear tinfoil hat pride, case believe Hanlon's razor applicable. Nice work!! earned next doom badge! Yeah South America sure winning. procedure would deemed experimental network America. Sounds like $50k. That's much dad's visits cost every 3 weeks IV injections, pays co pay. waste time people.

The ignorant can't educated unless want learn truth mentality bred within generations. It’s crazy. Like miracle Oh cool. Tell me. people go home? arrest charge prosecute bad cops. find mental health or....

Oh ruin man's career kneeling stupid anthem killing man kneeling neck. anything before. anything now. NYPost reliable. Double-whammy. Cuomo said, outbreak anywhere outbreak NY safe even though got numbers way set up. wanted publicity it. TSA ban air travel. he’s fucking douche. Lead way, Gov.  Would ADA possibly apply here? Jax bad times convention. Keep spare mask glove box. keep extra gloves well. Haha, yeah, Danes Ättestupa all. I'm sure refusal burdensome elders really geography though since right Sjælland there's Møns Klint Stevns Klint despite super high steep... think two would probably worked.

But yeah, good luck tossing grandma 2nd highest point ""Himmelbjerget"" despite name translating ""Heaven Mountain"", measures gently sloping 147m really suitable purpose. highest point, Ejer Baunehøj similarly big, pleasantly sloping hill 170m. much else country even comes close (besides Bornholm yo mention). hell even news. standard right now. mask entry anything number death catch soon, keep mind people ventilators 14-21 days passing away. take account additional 2 weeks contracting virus symptoms start showing. thing reopening, states start opening month ago, number cases rising. able keep number death low till far stay-at-home order brought us time hospitals ramp prepare bonus ticket expiring soon. need sure gathering large crowd inside mask bad idea. sure yet. Unless get sick can’t possibly trust experts... lawyer, HIPPA apply. Wonder bad North South Carolina numbers going today. Perfect time reopen...















The morgues Without consequences wrong gets away everything.. would better say consequences reestablishes even dangerous ones dont see happen..

This way even ridiculous since happening front america's worlds eyes realistic shutting entire economy? 

More 50% deaths N.J. PA related nursing homes. NY state similar numbers. NYC much. political scandals?

/s Betcha there’s story refusal wear mask infections 2 weeks ago ~~barely~~ even pretend enforce them. watched whole clip knew Rogan's style would know Rogan Burr clearly joking around riffing other. Burr finished saying Rogan body type rollerblading knuckles would scrape ground. Rogan smoking cigar laughing hysterically Burr's disses keeping conversation going. categrocislly false. places lot spread (Italy, NY etc),, see numbers start slow weeks lockdown Damn. chain one places felt safe getting food actually wore masks properly didn’t leave noses exposed. fast food me. They're far apart partitions. Seems low risk. Stop making Canadians sound like morons. new there's reason think early would thousands re-infections possible. stories people potentially reinfected.  


Ultimately called Novel Coronavirus reason. know. time moves studies happen we'll know more. ""conservative activist"" lol Trying avoid censors one (third try):

In last two days seen (R party) officials blame: young, black people, migrant workers. 

Still waiting hear blame for: atheists, straight people, maybe eventually women.

And right says left play identity . No, we're like spoiled people countries make political statement basic hygiene.

Oh wait, that's mainly us. Either they're confused think everyone else is.

HIPAA says one disclose health condition behalf, can't disclose yourself. seeking accommodations, that's ADA need disclose condition. need tell everyone, need tell someone position grant accommodation. state 100k deaths? Please read properly. saying happened someone caught protest tested positive later without infecting anyone protests way could one positive person. can’t confirm caught protest. major difference annual deaths statistics then... Yeah, afraid New York State, Michigan states going get reinfected bunch, people flying driving hot zone states, spreading virus go. 20% actually random testing. perfectly random, reasonably close reality. Supply demand. easily replace employee relatively low level skill required perform given task fast food. think Joe product environment. started humble, gets talk experts everything. think anyone would start think intelligent there's steady stream brilliant people treating ideas respect. Bruhhhh thought 18% weekly number bad, get control got foot floor? America: 25 square feet retail space per consumer.

We’re built 1950 internet commerce. They’re built 2050 6G AR living. 

Commercial real estate become liability rather asset. many pen stores battery shops need Amazon deliver anything drone 2 hours?

And yet taxes due, thus property yields revenue costs money. It’s coming. Yes. impression people isolating. I’m actually surprised hear people diagnosed still going carry restaurants office visits. don’t think that’s right. coyotes? modelling saved thousands lives

That vaccine 

And this. making vast assumptions presuming :

\- vaccine found. 30 years AIDS discovered, still vaccine

\- vaccine found quickly. fastest vaccine ever developed mumps. took four years. 

\- vaccine effective. Ccoronaviruses tend trigger long-lasting immunity. quarter common colds caused human coronaviruses, immune response fades quickly, natural infection doesn’t give much immunity except it’s severe infection, vaccine do? could better, don’t know. 

\- virus mutate. viruses, influenza, mutate rapidly vaccine developers release new formulations year. rapid evolution HIV major reason vaccine disease. 

\- vaccine found quickly, used vaccinate everyone short space time. rush develop vaccine – safety must remain priority. Unlike experimental drugs severely ill, vaccine given potentially billions generally healthy people. means scientists check extremely carefully signs dangerous side-effects. search Sars vaccine 2004, scientists found one candidate [caused ferrets. Another serious concern “antibody-induced enhancement” antibodies produced vaccine actually make future infections worse. effect caused serious lung damage animals given experimental vaccines 

A vaccine means guaranteed likelihood, coronavirus vaccine 100% effective. likely end vaccine, number vaccines, partially effective. partially effective vaccines problems: vaccine doesn’t stop virus replicating encourage resistant strains evolve, making vaccine redundant. 

But doom &amp; gloom - scientists wondering whether common cold coronaviruses crossed humans distant past caused similar illness settling down. virus doesn’t change there’s reason think miraculously five years’ time won’t still cause pneumonia - that’s hope: end much mild disease get bad cold it. We'll never completely rid it, vaccine time passes it'll become like flu probably think may look MAGA mask go vote. It'll confuse shit everyone. * Countries less 300,000 inhabitants

That responded to. Another NY Times columnist present incident. called bullshit 61% confirmed cases state ages 0-44, definitely younger side population making majority cases. honestly good news coming contact higher risk individuals. Well, take percent positive number bypass actual number tests. Percent positive consistently dropping low single digits assured catching good percentage cases. Arizona going place observe truly exponential infection growth rate. Almost nobody adhering guidelines, restrictions significantly relaxed compared shutdown. I'm work contract atm though I'm likely asked extend it, I'm seriously considering going without work awhile get hell shit really hits fan. 

I'd probably okay, I've already lost lung capacity childhood pneumonia interested risking breath paycheck. People like talk close social settings?  never officially stated. happened info leaked out. knows true. need liberal agenda yeah course back peddled. keep liberal overlords happy. Imagine whole existence troll, try loudest asshole kicks. know dumbasses say it’s infringing freedom using excuse bc can’t stand stanky ass breath. LOL Well, that's certainly convenient. guys hypocrites. County/City officials TX figured magic riddle Gov Abbott apparently wanted figure whole time instead telling (/s, know he’s full shit) going start requiring businesses require masks fined don’t. ridiculously piece meal it’s stupid there’s collective front there. already know 2 places pretty much right next opposing rules it. Solves nothing. whooshed super hard realised weird conservative activist sound. activate want conserve. me?  None articles give conclusive evidence masks useful prevent spread COVID-19. bunch gotcha headlines linked articles studies say evidence needed. look like sheeple linking website. There’s plenty pictures videos protests people without masks. People hugging eachother. People spitting one another. Trump issue. Yeah, page. appreciate follow post adds lot specifics hopefully people read (especially yours) really get full idea. grateful that. type measures help slow spread. Honestly wonder foreign entity maliciously speaking behalf Swedes. 

Normally Swedes like this. know guy vast amounts facial reconstructive surgery last two years car accident given exemption hard enough breath fake nose structure. Obviously that's pretty damn rare case. leadership country. zero confusion, OP lied. Period. bottom line heard beginning. Social distancing mask wearing going stop disease spreading, effort slow spread overflow hospitals. I've seen people claim POW's PTSD prevents wearing mask, fabric touching face like triggers them.

Whether telling truth first part second unknown.

I called one Karen claimed Asthma. Fo real? bad asthma piece cloth front mouth sets off? yet act like participating wearing around chin? buff husband also wearing mask around chin nothing say. checkout supermarket. like code get removed. 

The squaRes seem terrible every day. Imagine believing enough comment Jesus, 18% positive!!?!?!? appalling. 5% less chance catching cases. That’s old news. [In latest statewide results, 17.7% people swabbed tested Apple Store Delaware mall. mall reopened, Apple Store not. phone need repair. nearly two-week wait get appointment Apple authorized provider. would much rather wait experience mild inconvenience opposed store open could increase risk exposed exposing others community. Hospitals full surgeries resumed doctors offices open again. hospitals overflowing Covid. Interesting - thanks info. Here's hoping case trend (or lack of) we're seeing Minnesota holds states. interesting see many *remain* unscathed.

I work hospitality, food service, tourism initial layoffs closures affect me. However, clients hospitality, food service, tourism 2-3 months clients paying bills starting catch up.

Everyone place domino fall, back others. Autumn? laugh that's funny passengers applauded Mr. Straka exited plane.

... everyone clapped!  \#FauciLies Yeah that’s misleading headline. misleading actually. Russian roulette pretty safe super lucky. read several articles posted several comment discussions seems kinda divided. kinda wanted semi live discussion people kind feel out. Thank responding.

Imagine “magic”  Yes median length stay nursing homes 5 months. Median one three types averages. 

Here another source help clear reason large difference mean median numbers due small number study participants long lengths stay. likely unusually healthy people healthy people much less likely killed Covid-19, median seems relevant average two reasons: 1, people expect experience, 2 people outlying time likely healthy killed Covid-19 since Covid-19 typically kills underlying co-morbidities. That's pretty much i'm 4 bedroom 1300 rent outer sunset.

Sounds like interesting rotation! sound like great doctor :) Bleib gesund, Arnie! Vielen Dank für deine Unterstützung dieser schwierigen Zeit. That's good reference use, thanks. Quick question though, ""influenza like illness"" section mean? think correct. example, risk transmission outdoors actually [18 times less risk transmission Many states actually re-opening plans well thought-out, based data indicating return ""normal life"" certain interventions likely stop spread virus % people getting sick. travel Germany work couple weeks back, makes indeed mandatory shops.
Mostly really liked low tech method enable contact tracing needed fill form contactdetails anywhere ate in. Easy throw away couple weeks data entry probably expensive abuse data dataminig Somehow think China told say Yes wife listed job 407 applications 4 days....

How square articles saying people mooching unemployment pays much? charts date tested, date reported. example know Florida trying suppress data, looking epi curve. presume joke. know doctors agree me, need peer review medical sources order believe criticism medical profession, got believe drinking kool-aid; positively wallowing kool-aid powder. joke, applaud sense humor. not, want extend condolences mother given birth knucklehead. Doubtful time pandemic, testing available severe cases, often happened old people. testing become widespread, surprise median age cases come down. People wearing masks wrong instead, covering mouth nose  current situation, Sweden really save economy anyway everyone else shutdown, yeah hard agree. Sweden far lost one save economy anyway, ugly duckling Northern Europe.

However, everyone taken approach turns question of, ""when get vaccine?"" ""how much poverty approach cause?""

Honestly expected analysis come back 10x, 2.5x. 2.5x correct, total deaths worldwide right would closer ~1 million. Global deaths due poverty definitely exceed that, it'll kids dying starvation.

That said, over. gap could widen, could far 2.5x two approaches. get vaccine October, Norway looks like huge winner. late 2021, may wind taking Sweden's approach anyway.

There's crystal ball this. Honestly think original projections, vaccine looking like 18 month endeavor, would chosen Sweden's route. Seeing vaccines horizon now, maybe Norway looks better. However, think agree worst approach US, riding middle getting fucked sides. late lockdown. Early action essential minimise exponential growth. 

Partly also lockdown harsh Québec

Sweden lucky infection slow starter. God damn virus much ""flu"" scary. Trump came Phoenix told Duecy forget plans reopen. Duecy complied.

So deaths COVID deaths Trump Reeelection Campaign deaths?  basically done everything wrong imagineable.

'Challenge accepted!'

Trump Cult Member governor California 8 years. I'd think would move snarky ""celebrity"" group. needs reach lot higher want herd immunity. it’s even possible. primary home business expense therefor depericiate. depericiating asset definition, however home use rental, depericiating asset.

Your primary home exempt gains sale lived 2 last 5 years make certain threshold (250k single 500k married) like home getting fucked usually. 

Yes, take absolute bath homes pretty screwed, also rarely happens US extremely uncommon homes materially drop value here. 

It absolutely happen yes, frequently.

There plenty areas businesses extremely advantagious tax code, homes super pro homeowner. result broader testing. young people tested, ""asymptomatic' cases. Lucky married her!  Still waiting source spreading parks. go back quarantine we’re actually ready? Like wtf a) true
b) many states end far worse NY know next day walked back statement asymptomatic transmission rare. Well hot spot states govs believe science Yes. 1 sick. 2 Asymptomatic transmission rare according W.H.O. every right wear mask think make healthy. right pushing life choices onto others. Take personal responsibility take care yourself. Dude, people insane. sub actively censoring data comments support lockdown narrative. mods removed comment link crazy ""96,000+ deaths July 1st Sweden lockdowns implemented"" study. refuse provide reasoning censoring comment. actually getting pretty scary people pigeon-holed viewpoints can't actually take step back look things rationally. fucking douche. Dude deserves sound ass-kicking. Thanks, know maybe give another try virus lot trouble spreading rurally here, though speculate (even though suspect know why). Something like 5/6 cases HRM.

Most deaths contained within one seniors living complex, however majority cases overall people seem see lot faults America, great. need people challenge societal norms structures created previous generation. Gotta something though. Vote, find someone shares opinion volunteer campaign. lot problems generation believe great ideas overall would lead America better future. But. don’t fucking vote! infuriating. Climate change HUGE issue one cares right bring up, say farce red haring pandemic economic problems.

Can’t give up, gotta push forward somehow. eat lot paint chips kid? Good ride trucks! 😂😂😂 That's fair agreed counts, wanted make abundantly clear examples, Florida Texas, absolutely case, governors full shit cost people lives. actually pretty nasty news:

you can't rely tests (unless extremely accurate — way beyond available right now) tell anything useful start pandemic. Lmao ama walk away sub like he’s folk hero Herd Immunity sounds like something want, cost lives happen wisdom listening experts. weak breathe mask probably outside ICU arms reach O2 tank. First all...wtf 72? look young??

Huh? looks 72. looks like 72 good shape look younger 72. made graph myself. Actually [here's another version like little separated scales two curves.

I get tabular data [COVID Tracking super-useful site records data reported US state daily. Florida data FL Dept. Health reports. get things [actually thought Nietzsche bee’s knees went building identity based atheism, alas thing. Places like New York Minnesota negligent result many people nursing homes care centers died.  80 percent deaths Minnesota people nursing homes.  

It's people look ""old"" 20 year old, mostly people congregant living.  government several states including Cuomo NY Walz MN blood hands forcing allowing Covid patients transferred hospitals rehab centers nursing homes.  Money. nursing home for-profit industry. care people living them. go walk around one see type ""care"" residents receive. want $$$$. ""Those darn kids skateboards, rap music, pokeymans"". 

Of course they're going blame young people, that's usual par course. Sure, young people certainly responsible virus. said, older people better. Trying shove blame one group people plain stupid, every demographic bad examples right thing, trying pinpoint one shove blame onto going help anything. people area stopped caring? it’s half year early days reliable approximation. things mention kick in. Minister Archival Sewagery guess 37 median age lot things. That’s single day almost many Belgium last 4 months (!), it’s considered bad according rest world
 
(but know that’s slight overcounting deaths, didn’t even come close complete hospital overrun) It’s really ignoring, it’s creating alternative reality that’s comfortable. history Damn, that’s lot strict expected Gilbert this. Bacteria survive surfaces long time multiply, viruses cannot survive long surfaces need host multiply. Yet. Think back started 90+ 75 60 45.... Notice trend? bad idea considered mass murder attempted mass murder. You’ve obviously never major cities states, reason NYC became massive hotspot literally entire population relies public transportation required get two, college outbreaks mumps past fall. told could’ve come contact someone, ended getting third dose October. asian culture enthusiasts never understand this. people marry people hate? people children hate children? kids ""save"" relationship. 

You one life! People need start living themselves. Cops shoot people running away. they've already subdued. sever spinal cord people transporting jail.

Miss apologia. Exactly. Everyone blaming protests seem pretend like people celebrating Memorial Day going bars, restaurants beaches throughout May. millions completely ignoring mask recommendations. Even single protest, would still spikes occurring right now. think immunity lasts months? big prayer.  public regard worker anonymous hero. least, company coworkers would thank power proper wearing mask... '0' vs. '152' cases

I think mean ""for cultured"". US cases case realize. Yes two numbers multiplied get 150 000 cases april 18.  Coronavirus contagious flu, spread dying way flu does. evolution many things go ""as expected"" Anders Tegnell.

- [March ""Anders Tegnell, changes earlier statement ""Sweden's Coronavirus peak reached"" instead says ""thinks"" happen Monday Tuesday."" Nebraska governor attempts murder Nebraska citizens. Jesus Fucking Christ. Yes blame not? 28,000 deaths later. Nice job Cuomo de blasio!! Considering states began opening protests ever started, considering everything incubation times, asymptomatic cases, testing, etc, fact takes time begin spreading sufficient numbers reflected data, surge unlikely related. Whatever increase protests probably start showing next week two, before... say Memorial Day activities before. Consider also virus documented US early mid-January. mid-March really started show significantly.

Furthermore, video protests I've seen showed VAST majority people wearing masks. Transmission outdoors masks much lower conditions. said, certainly spread protests least some, know much bit longer.  current spikes reopenings ignoring restrictions like mask wearing. extremely obvious I'm really amused hard folks finding non-linear thinking. Funny (newsweek) found statistic linked page (covidgraph.com). derived one could point high. Like what? look deaths ny vs florida. Look anti body results case ny peak. don’t get it. berating Cuomo nursing home fiasco? sounds like come August totally immune team assume pretty severe..Cause nobody wants go wait line get tested. Americans extremely lazy. important question need long test results come back, ridiculous. done 24h wanna go Conspiracy Land land Sweden reporting low numbers initially, revising upwards later one paying attention?... proved ""land"" real.

So choose conspiracy land. I'll point source original comment, I'll repeat numerous studies — using range methods — estimate many countries 5 10 people die every 1,000 people COVID-19. “The studies faith tending converge around 0.5–1%,” says fact, article published March 28 written two professors Lund best estimates COVID-19 case-fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion infected die – currently [0.5-1.0%](http://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033357v1). 

 

The estimate 0.5 1.0% infection/fatality ratio around quite time. Greek Life SEC schools another beast. I’M YOUNG PERSON. SPENT 18 YEARS SCHOOL BUILD LIFE MYSELF. GRADUATED GO WORK. I’M LUCKY EMPLOYED GO HOUSE WORK HOUSE WORK EVERY DAY VIRUS. SHUT UP!!! JOB LIKE MINE. Nature preference go.

It's young people... people posting month old articles? Wait forgot OG rotation ""its hoax"" anyone checked figures Africa? gunning 1. place America takes little die. Yeah, lumping together whole US like looking data Europe without differentiating countries. son flew AA last week. told us least 2 times got Philly airport bring mask. also extra hand out. videos waiting area. sure fking douce canoe thinks right belly ache like wasn’t told. Well, cop sympathizer I'm surprised confused lol Exactly. people going restaurants, etc, thing control. Open not; people gonna go. tragic, government needs step financially help businesses employees instead trying offer public human sacrifice.

If everyone would wear masks, would dramatically slow spread virus, increase people's confidence going out, help businesses struggling. ignoring issue pushing ahead reopening help long run. American government media tried render population stupid keep distracted locked imaginary partisan feuds.

That’s... optimistic Coronavirus care root  surprised. planning seeing validate numbers suspect states show unusual numbers compared similar demographics order states.

Thanks peptalk *most asymptomatic I’m sure math quite checks out, states cases rising, could theoretically lower herd immunity threshold maybe 30% state still basically sheltering place? assume earlier spread virus mainly going people either forced working/seeing others, people dumb taking unnecessary chances, spread eventually slow low hanging fruit gain immunity right? don’t think would necessarily quick process, states don’t really shut again, could happens right? Churches deathtraps. idea govern, involve people safety. He's probably aiming spot new Trump administration wins second term, wich something hardly happen allow people would vote die virus Sounds like he's got legitimate medical condition, leaning falsely claim can't wear mask.

b. Extremely strict. travel regions country (I think unconstitutional US). Basically reasons could outside going ot work going shopping

&amp;#x200B;

Since lockdown lifted, masks mandatory inside everywhere. also strictly enforced. guess get absolutely say policies seems like gave up. Poor guy, probably beaten trump. noticed lately, posts anti America/Trump pretty popular, say anything negative CCP China Xi Jinping, quickly removed? Since 90s   Thats seems like bad indication getting infected first time protect second time :L faucy trump said need masks Feb, June, Chinese stopped buying mask since March, still shortage? 
BTW, piles news tv Internet China asking taking masks, none media told that?
Mask China dropped back price pandemic, excuse make sense shortage now. 40% last month. like trying get kid eat vegetables Lmao people family. live boyfriend furloughed gotten zero money unemployment also get stimulus check yet despite tax return. work eat. explain like I’m 5? don’t get Ya man, hate Trump too. feel like infringement upon freedom, like forced wear tag. weird none gets mad public forces wear pants shoes.

Wear flag mask. mean Joe conversational insane amount fields/studies. might classically intelligent, terms volume knowledge could absolutely considered smart. Doesn’t make opinions right though, especially talks publicly 8 hours week years.

Inb4 conservatives start calling sell who's brain washed nazi dictator Governor.... Oh wait I've already seen FB timeline prejudice looks like. anti Asian prejudice widely accepted rise. one unfortunate consequences coronavirus. Stupid, entitled Americans revealing racism intolerance. 

Did also post opinion information useful subreddit many repeat articles say thing, post Welsh woman survived 79 days life support, repeated hash whether people want wear masks not? post particular feel unnecessary you? Sure, disregard human life problem. Sweden tried it, didnt open fully either, still social distancing measures etc, worst outbreak neighbors. lone enough people realize least \*some\* measures need taken. Obviously states cant go lockdown forever, going way direction isnt helping anyone either. Mostly speculation, combination delayed prevalence outside initial hotspots, virus highly infectious, poor host behavior? going lie. saw headline said read this. Yes, unfortunate since fact want wear mask labels ass already wants mess them? social pressure needs applied around. Fair. confirm people outside Spain, indeed bullshit. get Kleenex boxes feet!... Certainly, sir. Seriously?

The UK way worse state Italy ever xD Hey man, what’s oral fixation? here. walk store P100 pink filter cartridges (brand new pair now!) gloves hands 6’2” 210 lbs please back fuck away me. far, good. need mass stink bombs.... force people cover faces. put words public. Anyone come study what's there. like study articles newspapers changed written. formality writing, instance. effectiveness editing (which done nothing gone downhill). Press x doubt. government response lame people country great.  think answer pretty right. 2 days retirement... Tell CEO AMC Clearly not. Someone first run hospital beds. feel bad people going suffer imagine huge part 2 trillion dollar ""relief package"" set aside pay coronavirus hospital bills single patient America worry it...

Imagine many less lawsuits would result hospital bills lost wages sick...

We can't solve problem country though... find ways around saddens me... think really like Rogan really anybody - he'll let really talk.

Yeah, lot ""wisdom"" pretty pathetic, least he's constantly telling think delivering information editorials like waaaaay much media nowadays.

I hardly watch him, somebody actually want learn show give dinky amount quotes sound bites let really process guest coming from.

Mostly, unless MMA, think Rogan worthwhile expert anything - ignore he's saying. Wow. wish one day smart are. 

Dont need consent study people something? God, it’s 3 months Today, r/noshit ... Nobody could seen coming Lol, expected, announcement absolutely effect California city. announcement, nobody wore masks. announcement, nobody wore masks That's fine murdering people carry perfectly fine. That's great. love it. it? horseshit. im sure mild. learn nothing lipstick eyeshadow. surgical-style mask, worn tough guys cut guts living. wearing mask threatens manhood, must pretty fragile. hoax, really bad, agree that?

 

1/3 coronavirus cases asymptomatic.

The CDC's ""current best estimate viral transmission disease severity int US"" 0.4% symptomatic cases die. people 49 under, estimate 0.05%... idea here. Wear mask minimize risk spreading infection. much winning. Ugghh, waiting this. parents live one less source worry things relatively good there. Thanks video though, I'm sending relatives friends think speaks louder anything else could say. mom good isolating much possible wearing mask can't, dad idiotic. refuse wear mask, goes gather friends ""forgets"" it. drives nuts. Fed gov decided adequately support cost Covid State level. 

States can't print money, plus operate balanced budget, meaning many States pushed opening sooner lack resources.

Like things (if gets bad again), could cost us deal second time, would done right first time. cover hards please ignore fact universe expanding exponentially, it’s easy dismiss Big Bang. Here’s say something that’s increasing distance clearly decreasing prior that. important, unlike arguments creator, stems direct observations, realm thought experiments. 

Ex nihilo arguments presuppose understanding matter shouldn’t presume knowledge of. People attached freedoms give up. Normally right kill people, add coronavirus proxy people commit mass murder fun without suffering consequences maybe dying virus spreading hundreds others. Florida rise weeks every day new record. Yeah, like supporting thousands idiots meeting close proximity ""protest"" (read: riot). Thanks going detail, appreciate it. whole article. title misleading.


Dr. Anthony Fauci, told AFP think “we're going talking going back lockdown.”

Fauci added: “I think we're going talking trying better control areas country seem surge cases.” least spell ""their"" correctly. Come on. titled total dimwit conspiracy nut. Yes, is, ""Ok, Boomer."" Phrases come go. date one well daughter would like first doctor internet linguistics, studying internet memes shape language language shapes them. LOL (see there, using LOL?

Fascinating, it? unknowingly providing information someone study. :) family stay with? Remember 3 months ago official advice? 18 March 2020, USA less 10,000 cases gave due shortage masks, think many cases could prevented USA better prepared proper leadership.

It make sense then, make sense now. Wear mask. mention nefarious betting schemes. think counties except ex-pats shit? No, fact George Washington actually born. Hint: England. Go it!!! Good you. Apple devices don’t take seriously. herd get mask ill back Let’s everything keep nursing homes safe significantly reduce death rate. alright 22 good age die.

Shapiro guy knows exactly argue something really well, removes emotion, compassion, humanity rhetoric.

You'll see people claim emotions taint logic, everything he's talking stuff ties directly people - people emotions matter what.

I think make really smart arguments, strips away important part human experience, conclusions always flaws. Europeans don’t know tubing is?! different term it? incorrect. I’m sorry. :( like 97 today. Yeah wore mask. Wait, would otherwise? mask come in? take delivery. ""That Gen X thing say"" new, it? Seriously though. sent email today announcement reopening raised funds. may actually good shape.

Nobody defines celebrity broke nobody. Look much Kardashian family mills everything money.

But still downvoted it. Heart disease caused outside source. generally caused personal actions, unhealthy diet, low physical activity, excessive alcohol use.

Also, mid-april mid-may, covid passed even heart disease top killer. Things change every week. Masks panacea subreddit loves think. Yes, help don’t make immune. line thinking make people become careless. that’s without mentioning get eyes too.

Also, lockdowns meant stop virus, slow enough healthcare systems don’t get saturated (like NYC Italy) never planned long term solution. reality millions die virus.

Also, beginning, face masks low stock hospitals need average Karen. Even now, production ramped up, still scarce.

Although agree saying didn’t work (being malice lack evidence) stupid, reality also helped hospital get much needed equipment.

Howard Hughes famous businessman OCD lead reclusive lifestyle later life. comfortable sending kids back school allowed keep home Education Commissioner Mike Morath's return-to-campus plan, updated next week guidance school districts work. state require students teachers wear masks, districts able make rules face coverings, agency spokeswoman said. ""

I work community college TX in-person classes going right EMS industrial service students — maybe around 200 people visit campus throughout day.

We medical staff taking people's temperature heatgun enter buildings, everyone required wear facemask, we're supposed maintain social distancing. essential personnel students allowed campus.

For first week, medical staff stationed college entrance, everyone screened. second week, stopped checking people entrance, medical staff moved three buildings hosting classes. Well many staff work buildings, people havent tested screened weeks now.

We also one mobile testing sites set first week, apparently expensive keep running longer that, gone week 2. We're one larger CC Texas — smaller public schools going screwed.

It'll logistically impossible screen every student campus every week.

Just think parents care sending sick kids school Covid19 — many think Covid big deal either? Think buses going packed dozens kids, go multiple schools throughout day — there's way they'll make buses go back get sterilized run.

Before re-opened, one workers caught Covid19, quarantine \~20 people building rooms (luckily none caught it).

How could ever work high school? One kid gets sick, they'd quarantine whole damn school.

I really hope sense keep things shut ... LEAST attempt preventive measures — otherwise virus spread like wildfire throughout community. Agree. provide option professors teach online feel unsafe. Campuses close, economic fallout colleges would far much bare seeing covid patients. 

They hovering around 3k deaths nearly month. wait two weeks , right? Schwarzenegger president! almost there.

Using logic listening Let’s goooo. Fair point - absolutely people can’t (or won’t) use technology. could also see emergency time screw around phone get info. I’ve hard hearing entire life workarounds communication second nature - maybe people whose hearing loss newer. I’m also quite used communication fails everyday life maybe unfairly focusing able communicate frustrating vs. truly terrifying. (Because sometimes really is.) feel people wear masks unless solution make masks suitable them, thank making think bit broader reasons might be! forgot /s. course I'm making sense. new York times lied WMDs, lied trump FBI investigation, lied Evo Morales, helped cause outsed bunch right wing despots, suddenly I'm supposed believe lying help right wing? 


It's bullshit fitness, exercise, living healthy life taking care routine. that's look young still aging. Welp! Buckle up, boys! Etc Imagine specie defends murderers ordered “we’ll back” masks. foundation sounds great! won’t see protest based stats little longer someone stick ""political"" bit countries same? Whats justification countries struggling wearing masks prevent spreading? think countries playing ""political game"" US also? type person go BLM protest likely type person socially distanced protest, meaning likely people protest sick.

And importantly, type person would wear mask social distance protests. 

Meaning even super spreader event protest, secondary effects would largely mitigated.

Compare YOLO need stinking masks country? Every bar potential super spreading event, people cluelessly masklessly go back home, go get groceries without mask, go eat, back bar. on.

The secondary infections get exponential growth. say ""people"" mean literally everyone. Individuals, small/medium/large businesses. Local, state federal government's. 

In line work deal public considered essential staff. management **still** difficulty procuring adequate PPE.

And one country, global phenomenon. Remember stories coming federal employees confiscating PPE destined state governments?

Also I'm sure cmiiw means. trying converse good faith feel same. Well, one Florida already quarantine people coming New York (and NJ CT) Florida.

More importantly, New York 30,000 deaths. Florida 3,000, even significantly fewer restrictions population larger population. think Florida handled worse New York, simply paying attention. Ha! Americans right thing, haven’t done since WW2 eh. municipalities decent job still corrupt af. local street sweepers ones I'm talking about. Yep. sad thing first mask orders seem like almost everyone wearing one, least make shift one.

But people get tired it, governor says cities cannot mask orders barely anyone wears one. Say louder people back. missing saying. Certainly people likely get pass COVID jobs personal susceptibility (genetics, previous Coronavirus exposure etc.). population hits herd immunity significant decrease number people getting illness. 

That think NYC precipitous dropoff, ""back normal"" policy cause see-saw cases. Lol, absolute shit debater incapable arguing good faith equal footing. argumentation style ambush fish gallop. tactics anyone sound argument. Oh, forget 1563633+ upcoming articles bullshit study. know many regular beds available? 5% 60s infected 5% need beds, that’s 12,500 beds. think idiots wearing masks, went boat, marina building, literally 5% mask use, 20 people marina building, 1 wearing mask. even employees wearing masks sign eating many black jellybeans. general policy getting older. one strike rule. anything like, one strike out. get talk shit cause stupid.

Common sense dictates test would increase number infected find. 

However 3000 new cases hundred require hospitalization vs 3000 positives taken. 

Does one source hospitalization rate Florida? Neat reply. got nothing right, I’m sure feel really smart!

And way type self righteous. She’s going sleep you’re defending her, might add. immunity whatsoever, would literally seeing thousands reinfections already, especially among healthcare workers, much doubt ""none"" like title states.

Instead handful questionable cases, that's even small percentage infected. countries taken greater blow economy due full lock down. took immunity route recent articles people recovering virus gaining immunity pretty. Shit, summers prefer spending bulk day inside air conditioning. little news trying neutral possible.

Sweden increases testing finds lot new cases. expected given previous testing capabilities procedures.
It bad news. Cases still even test general even quarantine, isolation whatever collecting data always good.

Now political side gave chance countries easily say swedes treated differently comes travel because.. look new cases!

Since long ongoing debate also lags Sweden reports weekly. first time something like happened. germany reporting amount tests weekly base long time new cases definitely normal.

Sweden going toilet big news given circumstances. That's catch - known whether they've actually infected. wearing mask workout home? mean unless there's video Arnie *also* molesting children (even touching girls chests) point cringe physically recoil, I'd vote Arnold, too... born US qual'd run.

Woops xD think one commented.

Hahahahahahaha...



Hahahahahahaha this, last time sick mos earlier fall. Definitely think going die. Felt horrible recovered 3-4 days back normal. Covid million times worse that. people learn. It’s bit stupid one outcome been. right way done, way back March would quarantine infected areas non low infected areas instead shutting entire country down. reached areas - say Arizona - worn SIP orders need time. Could've case intelligence general population follow normal distribution (it does) satellite research really joke.

it used search keyword really used Chinese people.

so I'll offer research comparison here:

if select time range, set location Hubei-Wuhan, find keyword ""diarrhea"" "" dysentery "" (腹泻 &amp; 拉肚子 &amp; 痢疾) trend went 2019 August. keyword went (and keyword used August paper research) ""the term diarrhea"" (腹泻的症状), occupied lowest search traffic, also strange since Chinese people search cure way.

and, read closer report linked, let quote:

""The study, yet peer-viewed""

&amp;#x200B;

yep, even published paper. agree. US mask political issue Master Obvious continues make prescient statements. concerning indeed; can't really see saving grace moment. 

Well, case hope goes well despite looking bad right now! Burr say lots therapy anger management? That's probably helped ton. imagine many lives could saved simply stopped counting dead? bet numbers don’t capture masks bought retail outlets US shipped overseas private individuals. argument baffles well, like, it’s easier someone believe entire globe full constantly feuding countries can’t agree anything suddenly came together got every scientist doctor politician board ...make trump look bad? keep hearing things like “democratic hoax” “trying hurt economy” I’m like “do think whole world United States? welcome.

Obviously research we'll get nonsense. asthma, two weeks ago went hiking 4.5 miles, lots changes elevation, 3 hours wearing mask almost entire time (I took couple times people around, mostly left contaminate it). I'm fat guy, huffing puffing mask climbing down.

If handle that, everyone claims medical condition able handle putting mask they're shopping groceries.

It's absolutely useless beyond serving corporate PSA statement. You’re idiot. 😂 Okay so...all interesting movie releases real LPT always comments. protesters wearing masks exposed protests. However, no-mask/anti-lockdown people taking preventative measures 24/7. creates wider range exposure COVID.

Like want part combating sensationalism it’s disheartening sometimes. leave guess I’d missing 400 articles case count Florida, huge loss. Thankfully r/COVID19 exists.

If works, could start see vaccines get injected October. Thank you! really appreciate that, internet stranger! Life sucks ya die say hey helping others brings happiness one denial there, skippy - people still protesting regardless right thing them.  Theaters completely nonessential.

I say Texans dont seem answer phones, set voice mail boxes. good number people know exposed virus cant get phone. speaking people experience people cooperative. good number honestly pleasure speak with.  

The group challenging illegal immigrants. Obviously current political climate empathize unease speaking us. also obviously white male phone sometimes right person speaking cultural/ethnic group. Something work on. Trying learn spanish connect better. God hope Leo Laporte isn’t behind show. Succinct summary. He's telling public handle truth. Fauci could've said masks vital block transmission emulate herd immunity they're short supply. please leave N95 masks alone medical folk.

That would've better did. Lives would've saved. didn't. lied people bc trust w truth. 

So, would blind faith they've made blatant lie? They've LIED. exaggerate benefit mask-wearing simply give people sense greater control disease? Or, they've co-opted PPE manufacturers? I'd already gotten mine Mozart thread. knew one would be. clicked anyways.

Why like this? island nations pretty good!

Well except one... already Humans literally making music, playing sports, holding gatherings since beginning existence... point people surprised response getting? It’s surprising, like all. Lol, speeding tickets enforceable? Yes. people wear mask selfish people care world see others though situations. put mask save economy, human lives. Besides, makes look cool positivity better (lower) state country whole, 2.75% vs. 4.5% statewide / countrywide. Hospitalization rates mostly driven expatriates returning Mexico care, beds use remained somewhat level - still May levels, less 20% unused bed capacity. (I see county-level stats ICU capacity specifically) Hebei Liaoning cases related Beijing outbreak? misinformed cavemen like live check Looks like patients tested early March. know that's relevant anymore.  I'm Michigan (Please dont hate me). Here, experience opposite. old people wearing young people aren't. looks like Tim Eric character il buy one arnt 30$ stores. experts said February March wear masks. say failed protect people said disease currently wide spread masks needed small portion society would contact disease. 

The sources painting statement masks ineffective lying. hahahaha way knowing something true Somebody tell Joe Rogan. can't see masks lasting all. physical reminder dystopia we're in. get might effect preventing asymptomatic spread (which seeming less less likely studies come out), eventually need find way mitigate virus protect vulnerable rest us freedom live lives without restrictions (while still washing hands course!)  I’ve seen enough images virus last ling time. personss didn’t go protesting Well, yeah. want misanthropic. live northern CA, red county. interesting say least. went grocery store earlier today people noticeably wearing masks. caught big first, really died down, employees stopped wearing them, things looking ""normal"", would appear least one small corner town awareness snapped back place today.

I would hope come enforcement, cases keep rising, really hope people begin understand *why* all. Public statements go long way, they're completely undermined public statements. covid gets worse, unfortunately people begin understand first hand need take precaution. think eventually catch on, sad slow that's going. inconsistent states like Florida Utah getting back accelerating growth. Fauci problem  wearing masks?? absolutely nothing bad happen. convinced Texas control. God bless America. true, everyone page reviewing information, disconnect.

However, always one person always struggles creating working relationship others. individuals tend create tension, therefore coworkers become agitated miserable. take long smarten up? Wear Masks!!!! know going come surprise you, scientific community base work single piece anecdotal evidence YouTube video. M'ah freedoms!! Notice say ""FDA Approved"". say ""FDA over-the-counter product"". They're saying category in, making think they're saying approved. I'm going 1 guy said podcast interview. good hear though experience. tell new asymptomatic carrier became confirmed cases yesterday (all domestic)

This number included numbers confirmed cases. 2 28 new confirmed domestic cases previously asymptomatic carriers, 26 freshly confirmed.. Wow. That's well said. else explain Bill Gates warned flu like virus 5 years ago.

Sadly, dad probably find way misconstrue statement come conclusion Bill Gates' prediction proves theory: philanthropic Bill 'one"" planned all. Well made laugh. Good point. What? else would isolate symptomatic patients theres 9 beds available? making absolutely sense. there's really point talking cant understand simple concept overcrowding infirmary leading solitary confinement used quarantine. everything news outlets coverage pandemic.  replied sentiment times, believe handle way capacity guys seem give us credit for, maybe people dont realize massive scope program.  Thanks reminding me. could probably get washing mine Dawn, I'll splurge woolite. ""Well, I'm going get pneumonia, can't get pneumonia hoax.""

*::takes FAT RIP paint soggy paper bag::* Masks pointless. Many schools barely enforce normal rules. Good luck enforcing mask requirements half parents actively oppose them.

Anyway, realize many teachers get sick, schools close again, right? Yeah, online learning ideal, situation none options ideal. Parents need childcare kids need education, that's worth sacrificing teacher health. people jerking like Demi-god I’m dropping tell get fucked “Just it.”

And 99.9% flu.

If lot people COVID UK December would noticable. Exponential spread would made apparent.

This result Italy believable, we're talking traces virus probably dozens cases, thousands, mention exact timeframe would bet late December, Christmas.

You’re constantly looking enemy. wasn’t this, it’d something else. Lockdown prevented need public consume medical PPE contact people immediately reduced period weeks.

That wouldn’t stopped irresponsible, knee jerk people bum rushing available stocks.

Now businesses reopening, advice changed.

It’s really hard see way *global* shortage PPE even now. World where:

 * grossly ridiculous misinformation worshipped masses blindly
 * something non-questionable value equality human life justified protected hate violence. ( even though access space age technologies understand great detail biology) 
 * politics lazy blaming hating imaginary opposition endless lies enough creates billions tangible value certain individuals,

You may feel powerless helpless. 

That remember extraordinary humans walked changed world better centuries odds. Mr Schwarzenegger another great example this. 

Thank Arnold everything done continue beyond highest standards! future generations lucky you. There's simple solution that. Talk louder keep mask on.

I wear mask day long work, every one us figured out. son documentary. worth watching correlates another finding weeks people without mild symtpoms lost antibodies.

Its rare healthy person dies. look new york studies like 90% deaths preexisting conditions. First I'm talking cloth masks clear. understand principle. everyone touching damn face. empirical study cloth vs surgical cloth lead higher rates infection influenza. 

And like said. Iowa basically fully open. I'd say less 10% wearing masks. hospitalization rate time lows conducted shows significant decrease transmission masks added situation. 

Or social distancing hand hygiene.  settled since. Face shields anything pushed harder misuse impossible nearly zero increased risk wearer. Typical me, me, me. y'all spoiled brats parents never taught think others shows. agree.. need lock downs seems overly optimistic stoopid Like said Karnataka government trying hardest create false sense security,hell CM even openly said control(I guess certain amount control Bangalore cus actually trying there,other districts/cities much). think Amazon warehouse space we'd need. Sounds like nothing say actual quality research, keep returning back name paper. Daily Mail also national news paper developed country people still take everything say grain salt. lead prison. also lead shot rehabilitation. shouldn‘t lead death sickness. 

If can‘t find empathy human dealing sickness death, you‘re side humanity strive for.

That doesn‘t mean okay crimes commited. did, even poor social standards, leads crimes used excuse. pay did. must terms society deemed suitable. (I‘m disregarding problems within justice system itself).

Dostoyevsky wrote „The degree civilisation society judged entering it‘s prisons.“

I don‘t wish someone stole getting sick. also don‘t wish someone murdered cold blood would getting sick. wish people protected actions want convicted persons shot rehabilitation, possibility them.

Many species share genome. bad something done months ago. Factories could constructed since March. Good/important jobs could created. 

Alas, leadership. Always looking informed change views needed Right. Testing opened anyone wanted test referral last week. Expect cases go now. Also CLT amount people see wearing masks staggering.

Friedrich Nietzsche, Parable Madman (1882)

THE MADMAN
Have heard madman lit lantern bright morning hours, ran market place, cried incessantly: ""I seek God! seek God!"" -- many believe God standing around then, provoked much laughter. got lost? asked one. lose way like child? asked another. hiding? afraid us? gone voyage? emigrated? -- Thus yelled laughed.
The madman jumped midst pierced eyes. ""Whither God?"" cried; ""I tell you. killed -- I. us murderers. this? could drink sea? gave us sponge wipe away entire horizon? unchained earth sun? Whither moving now? Whither moving? Away suns? plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, directions? still down? straying, infinite nothing? feel breath empty space? become colder? night continually closing us? need light lanterns morning? hear nothing yet noise gravediggers burying God? smell nothing yet divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God dead. God remains dead. killed him.

""How shall comfort ourselves, murderers murderers? holiest mightiest world yet owned bled death knives: wipe blood us? water us clean ourselves? festivals atonement, sacred games shall invent? greatness deed great us? Must become gods simply appear worthy it? never greater deed; whoever born us -- sake deed belong higher history history hitherto.""

Here madman fell silent looked listeners; they, too, silent stared astonishment. last threw lantern ground, broke pieces went out. ""I come early,"" said then; ""my time yet. tremendous event still way, still wandering; yet reached ears men. Lightning thunder require time; light stars requires time; deeds, though done, still require time seen heard. deed still distant distant stars -- yet done themselves.

It related day madman forced way several churches struck requiem aeternam deo. Led called account, said always replied nothing but: ""What churches tombs sepulchers God?""

No, say science is, scientific method. increased testing + end lockdown people returning work going eat/drink + BLM protests. unnecessarily smug response

There nothing smug response. read way, Airline virtue signalling tactic employed keep attention could doing...

You're using term ""virtue signaling"" way seems aimed removing value proposition mask wearing discussion. care airline flag-waving, dog-whistling, virtue-signaling, line-dancing caret-wheeling. requiring passengers something necessary health safety, keep that, regardless steps might agree undertake, yes?

Either think mask help (you said opposite, moot) think use necessary health safety, especially enclosed environment (even perfect air filtration, since can't avoid particles droplets landing others, even high quality negative pressure, wear mask clean room too).

Let's contrast related situation: TSA security checks. absolutely evidence improve security less invasive approaches, yet continue mandate them. pure theater, designed make people feel safer, without providing real improvement outcome.

So here's thought process engaging everywhere safety concern:

* propose measure improve risk profile?
* costs associated measure burdensome risk mitigation?
* measures would meet first two criteria positively?
* additional measures work proposed measure improve outcome criteria?

That said, ignored reply, shame. I've worked outskirts airline industry, I'm aware many hidden issues prevent reasonable changes made (from competition safety comfort, etc.) shame people get laser-focused political cause hear anything else. stupid argue  Meanwhile stepdad convinced hospitals trying make seem cases actually do.

Which then?! course, still worthwhile identify people *do* fevers (or may) get covid test? exactly trust general population self quarantine symptomatic even necessarily aware might mild symptoms all. population 1 billion Thank saying that!! don’t anything illegal drug test would problem appointment get postpartum depression control finally solution right SSRI...I reading worried battle get face.

Europe isn’t sentient entity. doesn’t like dislike anything. right-leaning centrist...this one embarrassing topics ever comment casual discussion. life me, cannot wrap head around logic wearing mask situation like this. feel like wearing mask like running around screaming ""fuck you, hope kids *and* parents die painfully possible"" face every total stranger meet.

Absolute scum earth... already significant economic bubble artificially prop'ed up. already over-stretched servicing national debt, soon take entire defense budget. stock market? pumped inexperienced, millennial investors idea beyond fomo.

This first step economic downturn. companies start getting next quarterly reports, realize revenue significantly down. lead lay-offs less economic spending. vicious cycle play years.

You simply cannot greedy extended period time expect things work ok. can't magically fix economy keystrokes money printing, simply shuffling things around. likely severe depression ahead. Nobody gives fuck anymore. Let rip! Great points made thread. agree everything - I'm optimistic toward idea technological, &amp; much lesser degree societal/cultural, solutions resolve pandemic. try realistic entails. Delta Air Lines 500 company’s 90,000 employees test positive COVID-19, company’s chief executive officer said CEO Ed Bastian said vast majority employees recovered. Ten died due virus. said company’s webcast annual shareholders meeting Thursday rate infection among employees lower “any national average we’ve seen” overall infectious Transportation Security Administration approximately 50,000 security officers 689 employees test positive, including six died result virus. total, 21 TSA employees Hartsfield-Jackson tested positive, including one died contracting COVID-19. 

I curious many Delta employees working home. Article says 10,000 Delta-Atlanta employees do. Good standard obligatory visits needed refill medication. Especially there’s good pre-established relationship doctor good pre-established history using medication. Cuomo set high score all. police managed fine Spain. Given Florida death rate pneumonia far year already five times higher previous five year average, I'm guessing right. What's fuckin crazy multiple entire countries tried approach going ""oh fuck, viable"" stepping back. course anyways. New York hit 10k daily cases two weeks broke 3k daily cases. states follow similar pattern would work right around July 4th get there.

New York also announced lockdown day first hit 3k cases day (3/20). course! TSA useless needs disbanded know. go know seen. Unfortunately, American government practice nothing. let one two things happen watch.  spiked 20000, last days. even then, NY numbers coming areas increasing dramatically. say Texas, Florida, Arizona etc. problem based national numbers disingenuous. Slavery?

China's labor contract law requires companies purchase mandatory medical, pension, unemployment, work injury maternity insurance employees.

This includes, course, Apple's OEM factory ""Foxconn"".

At Foxconn Shenzhen, example, spend 300 RMB (42 USD), compulsory medical insurance cover 70% expenses, 90% case serious illness.

As side note, Beijing's mandatory medical insurance reimburses 90% deductible 1800 RMB (about 257 USD)!

Plus purchase additional business insurance cover 90% remaining 10%.

Slavery?

Also say again, MNCs set factories China, China gets paid labor assemble them, fact brand premiums ultimately profits still multinational corporations, think Apple OEMs China starting stock price boom? ? think profits assembling iphone China go China? Besides, Foxconn subsidiary Taiwanese company China managers Taiwanese.

absurdities Going taking mask eat popcorn drink soda. risk self isolate 14 days. think required elaborate condition extent necessary determine accommodation reasonable. far tell, guy provided zero. better headline would be: Asshole Grifter Delays Flight 122 Passengers Get Attention must stupid fuck.

There's host long-term serious health implications affect recovered covid patients. Even putting aside deaths, going herd immunity strategy saying ""yeah let's voluntarily give lifelong respiratory problems population"". insanity. becoming one ""shithole"" countries I'm arguing wearing them. I'm wondering enforceable. Chill.  fever high even feel like leaving bed Honestly, working served communities definitely way thinking. I've heard, ""I idea 8 months pregnant"" way many times.  crazy think 30 days ago 5% positive Arizona already harder hit Lombardy, numbers ghastly state   Might slow react thus quite spread capital implemented measures managed flatten curve, compared countries faster react thus flattened earlier stage?

You admit it?!        
I must dreaming... I'm permanent resident, can't run office I'm afraid. I'm California.

Good Live Florida, didn’t even get first wave chime in, got quite ill February. find don’t get sick often, take Tylenol shrug off. illness hardly pop-a-Tylenol-and-I’ll-be-normal type thing

Whatever February really made sick while, symptoms whatever 3 weeks. little felt quite better, mother also got sick see 2 doctors. First one didn’t know wrong second told bronchitis. two us thinking getting tested antibodies. 

It’s interesting share experiences. part believes virus making rounds 100th confirmed case country (late/mid March believe), haven’t seen information eluding country yet. 

I like seeing people Reddit discuss sort stuff people seem still understand importance still social distancing, proper hand washing whereas people IRL think they’ve act least amount caution. Excess mortality take account dieing recieving needed medical care increased mental health issue deaths. 100% believe number higher reported, excess mortality cant used way figure God fuck piece shit.  buddy pro Trump (I enjoy debating it’s easy crack him) wears masks. start saying keep politics health. disney implicitly saying DON’T COME! imagine onslaught karens yammering cast members thanks. Humans social animals. need interact. large crowds, outside rather inside, yes, idea won’t speak face-to-face friend another 6-12 months laughable Everyone needs give trump trooper big hug. 16% today. going up.  worrisome... looks like SC starting catch northern neighbor, NC.. sounds like ""the good Germans rose Hitler.""

Easier said done. Even state shitty anti science governor like Florida Oklahoma 

Please take seriously still never know second wave hit! hire best people.  said ever?.

Why would gather phone calls use social media communicate? Leaving gatherings really important, i.e. work political gatherings. Americans proud completely inability understand science. shoot anthropogenic climate change myth, screech vaccines causing autism, spread lies pandemic, cannot find selflessness simply wear mask.

1. deaths nursing homes.
2. fairly large segment. isolate nursing homes staff supply chain. realistic solution. lol. He's flipped many times much information given point. screwed.

Yep. tip iceberg. Mainly old folks wearing masks seems zero enforcement restaurant bar capacity limits. beach bars shoulder shoulder weekends lot masks evidence. We'll almost certainly double daily cases less two weeks. That’s problem.

Right! family even going restaurants open. wedding mean airports, airplane, taxi/uber, 4 days hotel living restaurant dining meals. much expect parents, 77 years old. crushed miss wedding. win here. 
It sounds like made decision miss wedding, need moral support right decision. think is, especially since health issue.

I'm scheduled get tested today - probably bit late (12 days). symptoms, rather precautionary ever done research instead spewing dumb 

Several research studies stating masks prevent spread covid prior protest, go false correlation you’re trying make. sound dumb fuck I’m people like you, that’s I’m pissed. science matter revealed options--beaches protests--are *not* harbingers apocalypse people want be.

Anyone believes otherwise plainly engaging science denial agenda. Coronavirus teach good lesson... covid rally interesting. Similar situation essential employer.

They've specifically hired cleaning crew come before, during, operating hours. cases cases cases cases generic Lysol sprays every single square inch building/office sprayed down. They've hired three people endless rotation spray.  grab door handle sopping wet. enter lobby say lean marble wall waiting elevator? whole wall dampened. 

One crewman cleans mask told inhaling chemical day long making sick. Recently stopped wearing altogether seem care anymore. get masks work.
 
But also get airlines concerned improving filtration quality cabin air virtue signalling.
 
Are individual passengers **AND** airline responsible safety? exponential. That's busted myth. 

It spikes early, slowly falls:  countries start this, better idea finding source. China first case December, outbreak January. virus already Europe Dec 2019, it’s unlikely source China. Maybe virus among us quite sometime, mutates contagious causing symptoms? science says masks work, minimal transmission occurs outdoors, lock-downs unnecessary. world start following science? Oh boi go science pretty clear: both. Sounds like nothing’s changed TSA. Good job neighbours!! would say welcome beaches would better wait better times:( hold on! government released updated number today. 28,313 deaths officially attributed COVID-19, one thousand last official report. number published many newspapers broadcast news today, think it’s disingenuous suggest government “hiding” information. What’s more, published/broadcast basically every day throughout process ongoing statistical revision. wasn’t like lights suddenly went one knew numbers weren’t updated. 

It’s true Spain’s excess mortality rate 43,000 thus far 2020, I’m statistician virologist, don’t know exactly differentiate number COVID-19 death toll. case, 43,000 figure also openly discussed media, anyone able draw conclusion. Perhaps pandemic worse would like show numbers, curve also flattened. 

To continue another comment thread, Spanish lockdown extremely strict, probably European country- absolutely prohibited outside home almost reason. partner stopped two separate occasions undercover police walking dogs, told us far home, didn’t need walk dogs together. Barcelona looked like post-apocalyptic ghost town. much Draconian saw countries, especially US. sense, believe curve Spain very, flattened, actually credit government considering peak outbreak Madrid’s death rate peaked seven times normal, even higher rates deaths recorded around world 1918 pandemic. Reminds office episode Effectiveness masks known least 1918. B-b-b-but private businesses allowed choose customers!!! Truly Rosa Parks generation... Here, pea sized brain.

“Pneumonia kills 50,000 people year U.S., according CDC.
This year, least 89,555 deaths attributed nationwide pneumonia February mid-May.
It tends follow typical flu season, coming December peaking January February declining March April.
But preliminary CDC data year show pneumonia deaths steadily climbed March peak April, mirroring trend line deaths linked coronavirus outbreak.
Surrounding states also seeing death counts several times greater normal:
Indiana: 1,832 COVID-19 deaths; 2,149 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 384)
Illinois: 4,856 COVID-19 deaths; 3,986 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 782)
Tennessee: 336 COVID-19 deaths; 1,704 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 611)
Ohio: 1,969 COVID-19 deaths; 2,327 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 820)
Virginia: 1,208 COVID-19 deaths; 1,394 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 451)
West Virginia: 72 COVID-19 deaths; 438 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 117)” Basically hope people actually adhere wearing mask public settings. I'm gonna hold breath really seem enforceable, city they've already added religious exemption mask wearing see easy people drop line skirt mandate. 

So either get hit hard next couple weeks people mask slow spread 

OR 

It continues run course burn state rate funny. Florida still checkpoints set interstates entering state checking people coming NY, NJ, etc. big waste time normal day give information self isolating. makes extra ridiculous FL way WORSE NY right now. need stopping Floridians give information self isolating. 

You made right decision, way. ton people actually. pretty evident can't keep attention spans longer weeks political scandals. finally begin recognize government’s herd immunity strategy? Alright stay lockdown forever? :p CDC official speak heard it? 65% already late. feel bad Texans kill. see smile behind blurring effect? lol. acquiesces time matter absurd claims are. think he’s flip flopped covid 20 times already real degen People fail understand viruses spread exponentially.

Let's say protests tarted 0.12% infected, number infected doubles every 6 days, 18 days protests 1%. another 18 days pretty big outbreak. Busch Gardens open already know people visiting park. long superspreader gets airplane spreads crap around whole country again? heard New York Doctor LA months ago, infected bunch people, long happens again? know percent act offhand, you’re right, lot deaths originated long term care facilities, reason isn’t much people old sick (that increase risk though), lack sanitation safety protocols. Even take (lets use numbers) 20% though, whole lot relatively “healthy” people falling victim. Also, people long term care facilities (“nursing homes” necessarily typical 90 year old grandma. people physical rehab injury, people e covering surgeries, people survived cancer rehabilitating. Calling victims Covid weak expendable extremely disrespectful says lot value place lives. 


Almost everyone knows someone affected cancer. Lots recovered way recovering fully productive members society. type people dying labeled less valuable “healthy” (remembering almost Americans overweight/have high bp/diabetes, highest prevalence pre existing conditions mortality Covid) Definitely lawyer I'm sure applies. HIPAA prevents doctor telling airline medical issues (without permission course) prevent telling least know of. would think *maybe* ADA keeps airline denying service that's I'm protected class think. Again, lawyer though could wrong this. Adding data:

* 7 day trend new daily hospitalizations hit new time high 4th day row (up 12% one day). [See chart spreadsheet [with data decent drop patients [were seen 

* Last five Friday's new cases deaths starting today. 

New Cases | Deaths
---|---
3246 | 41
1654 | 17
1579 | 16
702 | 28
293 | 12

[Disclaimer tied increase testing well people coming hospitals elective procedures?   Jesus. 

Per capita that's like Cali reporting almost 8000 cases one day.

We may well get soon..
 wow Sorry hear that. concerned FL. safe. America: Epicenter Corona Virus

Floridians: *hold beer* Large segment? Protect nursing homes bulk US deaths happened!! people PA hundred died 45. Fact!!! talking protecting vulnerable nursing homes. know are, can’t leave already. fact allowed thousands killed disgraceful!! probably many areas first confirmed cases, ruled flu pneumonia.

Seems little politically convenient soon mass protesting starts suddenly discover masks super effective thousands people shoulder shoulder it’s perfectly safe along wear masks. reason get pissy btw it’s discussion reddit bro ones attacking you. Ugh. flew Alaska Air week flight attendents flat ignored people wearing masks. Including people walking plane bins. Many people even called attention staff said anything. Well, put cat Leo outside days thanks this. Last evening visit driveway neighbor/friend comfortable even though back work seeing lots people. reason fine ten feet lawn chairs steady light breeze blowing right direction, toward neither us. He’s smoker appreciated seeing trail smoke going right driveway possibly COVID-19 viruses, away me.

But Leo, friendly sociable kitty apparently read CDC guidelines, walked guy let get petted while. Fortunately, weather nice, pine trees impossible climb get little birds, bigger birds knows better mess around with. He’ll catch mice around house we’ll leave food water him.

I really interested getting thing. Even so, Louisiana. report yesterday, claiming ""review results"". guess unfortunately number extremely high trying figure approach it. Yes, get that. come back mathematical inconsistency claim along 10 years claim.

But half deaths nursing homes, many assisted living homes? insignificant number? I've never seen two groups distinguished before, realize importance so. *a lot* countries states severe lockdown worse Sweden.

There 4 non microstate countries worse Sweden death per capita. would call *a lot*. Nice - ""heard"" ass? please mandate people dumb wear masks forced wear condoms instead stop procreating? Like Europe, NY significant immune population now. naturally new cases much lower.  mean would go subreddit based disease control. psoriasis (might spelled incorrectly) great insanly bad issue. Id probally go onto r/my disease bad enough id looking answers. mom 80's says knows time coming, want COVID 19, chooses stay locked apartment. agree choose spend finals years doing, hiding out, least wear mask try stay safe. donate blood Red Cross test antibodies absolutely outdoors vs. indoors. think protests (well-justified were) may damaging terms projecting idea we're giving social distancing, surprise led relatively actual new cases.  Risky, interesting approach. 

Maybe strive infected buttholes, thereby also bypassing lungs. can’t compare Sweden countries locked latter’s infections deaths postponed. Let’s see 2 years numbers look like. I’m going guess same. demanding explain things you? even still, bad 70,000 people died couple months? definitively say haven't? No.

My number based definitive numbers. number based speculation. speculation backed data... numbers. 


Edited Grammar Hey it’s still better surgical masks. Good buy. Right....there’s lower levels government state/territory level obviously referring to... refocusing issue think deaths. Abbot says Texas plenty beds, that's primary argument. preventing deaths, preventing illnesses, enough case sudden expected surge infections.

And would perfectly fine stance take. could keep infections level hospitals handle cases, that's reasonable. Question course whether true (and I'm thinking probably isn't) God bless him, fighting like hell.

I hope makes it. It’s better going home thousand dollars repairs. Except case, thousands medical bills. 

Mask distance. need stay home. gotta make political . Click link surprise. last sentence comment lie. Probably bad example since parents even let drive (after passing test 16) car way 30 fear accidents. That’s crazyyyyy emergencies chief World Health Organization confirmed Friday U.N. agency received genetic sequences China involving Beijing's recent coronavirus outbreak said appears virus exported Europe.
At press briefing Friday, Dr. Michael Ryan noted “strains viruses moved around world” throughout virus pandemic said fact virus Europe sparked China's latest outbreak mean virus originated there.
“What it’s saying likely disease probably imported outside Beijing point,” Ryan said, adding “establishing happened long chain transmission is, important.” said many coronavirus strains spreading New York could also linked Europe. That’s ok. Thanks!  also turned husband’s struggle Internet spectacle. I’d ok one laying bed. You’re arguing bad faith.

One position possibility maybe potentially save lives.

The position thinks it’s stupid.

Why err side caution safe? downside?!?! TSA holding back stock n95 masks supposed given workers. Explain that. don’t worry ain’t flying anywhere atm.  Karens going cause hard lockdown next great depression. 

When get military checkpoint tell them, ""facemasks infringe freedom"", see stupid ass.  places like Florida, testing mostly steady (or even slightly down) last month, cases we're getting thousands thousands new cases day, death rates rapidly increasing, that's GOOD thing.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nope, 26% correct. number PCR tests results reported today 12,476. 15,031 total tests including serology tests, get counted towards positive cases. can’t really compare anything Hawaii. It’s island. default there’s good chance better misery thing allowed Honestly, even guaranteed safe, optics look awful / would undermine particular message (taking COVID seriously). Viral infection growth exponential.

Bonus points figuring endlessly exponential. Google friend. There's plenty articles this.

For worth, understand face shield basically effective stoppong spread cloth/fabric non-medical mask probably protects wearer covering eyes (a big transmisson vector). Holy shit.

They wait couple weeks next. Exactly. captain simply roll in, cool voice, flight attendants marking passengers wearing masks they'll sure make sure they're banned airline life.  3 weeks New York still protesting haven’t seen sort increase, saying Interesting two stores closed Florida Southwest Naples area 20 minutes apart. increasing trend. Great question! speculation, think comes factors:

\- Florida's 'first wave' pretty small contained, significantly smaller NY. Fewer infections overall means fewer nursing homes affected.

\- first wave happened Spring ideal weather. Lots people outside means reduced rate transmission. skyrocketing rates we're seeing Southern states likely result hot, humid weather forcing everyone gather indoors circulated air aka perfect breeding ground transmission.

\- single biggest factor transmission among nursing homes racial makeup, nursing homes tend reflect neighborhoods located. complete guess, surprised outbreaks Florida Spring found mostly white communities. (Edit: looked up, racial makeup Florida 77.3% white, whereas NYC 42.7%).

Sadly, anticipating Florida, proxy nursing home community, hit real hard virus.   2 WEEEEEEKKKSSS!!!! see riots firsthand, street, yourself?

Whatever think, probably isn’t true lol. means return normal rejected individuals like thus making situation worse. 

You can't angry things broken refuse mend them. reason body gives fever precisely help fight infection. I'm saying heat prevent virus' spreading meaningful way, infected fever mean virus ""thriving"". family member Naples, late 70's. recently went see Physician. wearing mask waiting room Dr's office....

Maybe. documented? No. sure actually infected? No. 


You know 100% sure of? 5.4% documented infected died. stated. Temporarily demand global pandemic vs longer demand customer demand technology shift. Apples oranges. basically enslave people pay shit build iPhones.

And no, use iPhone phone use made China (was made different Asian country, yes). Puerto Rico's government US government. They're territory. would make bitter? died gotten it. That's proud of? Swedish brigade self censoring news sources read. 

Normal people know news biased must critically assessed matter accredited source is.  definitely. Quebec serves example locking general population much anything infrastructure protect vulnerable non-existent insufficient.

If people want compare Sweden Quebec, I'm seeing here, understand Quebec far worse outcome (by factor 3: 629 vs 226 deaths per million) Sweden, despite multi-month 

It's important understand why. still see many cities, states, provinces, countries still treating general population problem, STILL allocating resources correctly, still enacting policies deal reality disease. want fly windshield? Unreal definitely is. Trump literally said thinks people wear masks spite him. Yup, random .jpg. think want accelerate timeline Jesus comes, like end times type shit lol airlines ban him, make ass take bus everywhere. days gonna records while.

It's gonna interesting follow. lockdown phase, state's numbers growing, usually would hit peak one week, exceed peak next, setting new highs twice week. lot places open people disregarding guidance, could start accelerating day. We'll see. so, though? see article put health quotes? know implying right? next four years gonna replay last recession unfortunately.

We're talking depression rivaled Great one. we're going experience something experienced lifetimes.

Reversing lockdown provided enough artificial spike claim victory chickens yet returned roost.

Congress need things they've spent decades saying Overall think still potential great nation live potential beacon freedom hope.

There's one decade US exclusively benevolent. Every decade another atrocity. matter party charge.

Voting never brought future promised time honest conversation that. Change won’t immediate l, it’ll start.

Then we'll go extinct climate change apocalypse.

It's simple.

I'm interested political discussion starts extinction human race that's voting gets us. 

And everyone's idea ""reasonable attainable"" ends climate change apocalypse, would argue seems highly unreasonable.

We live extraordinary times. Voting offers ordinary results. simply longer time that. peer reviewed medical sources support claims? rent workers can't afford rent given city. (starting sound like Neal Stephenson novel . . . ) worse that, literally giving big ""fuck you"" 100+ people delayed/ inconvenienced pull self serving stunt. I'm shocked someone start pummeling him. Walkaway complely fraudulent campaign. Gimp masks eh? Agreed. far left too, consider science racist hatespeech. aren’t going claim article without sort proof quote official something. mean didn’t wear mask stupid him.

But matter conservative? Live bubble makes feel better... OK, save badge next time. That's good tip buy frozen veggies steamer pouches dinner. usually eat spring mix salad lunch, nutrients, I'll keep mind compare vegetables. Lol tough amirite! downvoting cause add discourse comments. I'm one those.

Does Mitt Romney still get deduct dancing horses? Can’t wait next statement contradicting hours  don’t understand that. offended someone else wearing mask? you’re personal freedom, mind business regards decide put face, doesn’t affect least, fact I’m protecting I’m protected.

I'm convinced virus following sort seasonal trends colds flus normally follow, right looks like lull yeah, that's scary thought winter ahead. sihkism originates India though! ancestors relatives right minute, point trying make. cater America claims greatest country world relatives poverty India? thing called American dream l believe obviously false.

Port-a potties could safer. problem public restrooms toilets aerosol fecal matters flushed. It’s shown virus spread way. common symptom virus diarrhea. It’s ok cause also doesn’t think it’s big deal doesn’t spread asymptotically. wish would stop calling people activists. activists. Activists fight change something greater good. example climate change, wildlife preservation etc.

Lets call people truly are. Spoiled pieces shit(s) crying attention. onus prove don’t work genius. onus show scientifically 

Dr. Anthony Fauci:
 “People walking around wearing masks. Masks provide protection people think do.” 

From link. References saying masks effective: 

“After reviewing studies worldwide, CDC found “no reduction viral transmission use face masks.” [18]

Similarly, recent weeks, World Health Organization also found “is evidence wear”

After reviewing studies worldwide, CDC found “no reduction viral transmission use face masks.” [18]

Similarly, recent weeks, World Health Organization also found “is evidence wearing mask healthy person community setting prevent infection respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.” thus, World Health Organization concluded “universal community masking” ineffective preventing “infection respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.”[19] Indeed, went far recommend wearing medical masks “may create false sense security” COVID-19, took pains reiterate “no evidence available [mask’s] usefulness protect non-sick persons.” [19]

Even N95 respirator, recommended medical workers, requires training use properly “without training, masks could expose workers virus also lull thinking protected,” according doctors Harvard School Public Health. Yet worse, practice, N95 mask found ineffective preventing transmission viruses: review six clinical studies, published Canadian Medical Association Journal, found medical workers caught viruses patients often used N95 respirators used ordinary medical masks.

As scientific support use face mask, recent careful examination literature, 17 best studies analyzed, concluded:

None 17 studies established conclusive relationship mask/respirator use protection influenza infection.[5]” Sadly copied original post shared freind went back shared here.. can't find original post, done digging came numbers. Regardless, increase pneumonia year previous.  don’t think accept it, virtual social interaction good substitute real social interaction stay lockdown years people say “fuck it” go outside socially interact, already happening areas. Nobody puts Donny mask! Nobody! hope mods enforce bans inconsiderate comments like one True that. extremely underpaid quality work produced. thought protesters immune infections woke virus? What’s politics it? fixed? work though. 

The countries locked mostly delayed inevitable. get deaths summer instead. 

The swedes certainly deserve critisism bungling policy regarding nursing homes. lead large proportion deaths. 

However deciding lockdown, actually brave. certainly gamble, seems paid off. hard truth nothing numbers supports locked first place. 

None doomsday prophecies r/coronavirus came true Sweden. 

Every day world moves policies closer Swedish model. Many European countries site nearly indistinguishable Sweden policy wise within next month so.


 hard part advocated lockdown admit vast overreach, overreaction places hard hit. States reported all-time highest single-day new case totals last week: Alaska, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Alabama (twice), California (twice), Nevada (twice), Oregon (twice), Arizona (three times), Florida (four times), Oklahoma (four times), South Carolina (four times).

States reported all-time highest single-day new case totals *today*: Arizona, California, Florida, Nebraska, South Carolina, Tennessee, mean, keep header foreseeable future. likely correct efficiency point :P I’ve seen former military Leo ""Call ambulance afford it""

r/shitamericanssay amazing continued support approach among Swedes. gotta wonder water. Sadly desantis reelection 2022 That’s awful. good example gender wage gap still exists. last press conference governor days ago insisted would closures anything mandating masks anywhere would First Amendment rights. okay take day people self care know, even service dog programs buy vests online

I get trying say fakers, purchased vest good indicator Every Finnish person ever met incredibly genuinely kind , kind people love gobout way helpful generous. people, Finland list must go places craziness Whose going cruises? think last horror stories Covid-19 cruise people would avoid like plague Yup, today reached highest new cases since May 1st. Like Google, Apple every app phone already tracking shit. also millions people riding subway like NYC breakout. many people shot choked job? 

How many times people hostile jobs worked? 

Did kill them? 

I mediate conflict patient want treated (offensive word) patient survived. doctor shoot choke anyone. 

Amazing go sorts situations without murdering people, right? 

If cops murdered less people, protesting. Literally millions people manage murder others. people, fact, go full lives without murdering single person. 

I think complicated situation spend less time judging people trying navigate competing moral dilemmas time asking cops shooting suspects back, choking death they're handcuffs, severing spinal cord way police station. 

All extremely reasonable expectations everyone else abides by. 

If want protests end, easiest thing ask police literally everyone else manages every day go work. Australia illegal let cat outside unless proper outdoor enclosure. rigorously enforced, council catches cat outside fine you. bigger risk council hires cat traps run risk cat trapped someone might necessarily hand cat council quietly dispose instead. also venomous snakes large hungry snakes. Maybe I’m crazy I’m seeing trend. States requiring masks opened bars restaurants fast seem issues. Put rules place benefit everyone enforce understanding. herd immunity strategy sounded interesting, realized 2.2 million death estimate got sick treatment attempted. overloading hospitals..... could make lot more. typo feeling airline succumbed mob mentality

They live another reality. lol fucked think deaths stay relatively low compared past. initial surge, especially places like NY, overloaded local hospitals. Combined even worse testing rates back meant people getting help later. Many powder kegs like nursing homes gone full lockdown yet.

So we're better prepared average age infection dropping. Things still gonna bad doubt we'll get back 3k deaths/day even keep setting records number infected. Although schools really reopen fall see shit going downhill fast. Yes, distribute best organic lemons fighting kinds cancers. find really sour ones ones really work. Combine patchouli. copper bowl quartz crystals, else work. Get back cure brain tumor. basically symptoms lost smell taste. PCP recommended testing. game. Football requires *ton* weight room workouts. Meaning bunch dudes crammed room together breathing heavily exerting limits. would less lethal mutates? works? Heh supposed say here... trump rally

He traveling rally medical condition thank administration great health care efforts. don't. I've worked healthcare admin almost twenty years, worked FB meme HIPAA ADA stuff friend mine. finally agreed try it, citations, screenshots, links sent her, instead 'I trust you, still think law wear mask'. So, small victories, guess. Hmmm. Well deaths follow cases couple weeks, we'll see. large increase percentage wise bunch 20-30 year olds means really bad catching asymptomatic cases better now. presidential press secretary like dream job put time land pretty good gig private public sector:

Look Obama's people landed:

Josh Earnest - Senior Vice President Chief Communications Officer United Airlines
Jay Carney - Senior Vice President Global Corporate Affairs Amazon
Robert Gibbs - Chief Communications Officer McDonald's Corporation


Unfortunately, still air happen Trump's former press secretaries. Spicer appeared dancing stars emmys. released book show unknown network. Sarah Sanders looks like going try run governor Arkansas. Stephanie Grisham abruptly stepped retreated back administration. said previously they'd play Wow that's fucking insane. choose surprised every time president let's down, never learn ignore it.  KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK we're fucking disaster. Covid-19 specific symptoms sign distinguish clearly bad cold influenza

Other fact remain sick 2+ weeks. media pushing Covid-1984 agenda hard beginning. They're really scraping barrel comes stories like this. Sure lot infections hoax people month ago they're part problem Thanks thoughtful reply kind words :). 

My nose gigantic crooked yes broken many many times. can't breath nose I'm one horrible mouth breathers probably worse comes spreading virus.

I surgery booked April 2nd let's hope gets rescheduled soon! new provinces reporting now? leadership so, encouraging so, surprise. percentage test positivity(which takes account increased testing) 15% arizona, 10% texas florida June 15. California's 5% Michigan's 2%. number less 8% considered good I'm unsure specific threshold. 

 wanted share president declared today No-Tax-Day Colombia. expected, many people decided go shopping, except HORDES! They're currently congregating outside shops, ignoring safety protocols established far. 

It's like Black Friday mixed bit Resident Evil number infected skyrocket couple days thanks great idea head state had. Oh, best part is: first day! 2 no-tax-days planned July.

My country f\*cked! I'm lawyer i'm necessarily trying argue legality conspiracy, i'm pretty sure conspiracy charge prosecuted, would case people conspiring together others something actually illegal. Something like corporate executives conspiring together embezzle money, explicitly know they're illegal they're using power influence advantage. get caught revealed extent conspiracy cease conspiracy. would still presented, charged as, definition conspiracy.

I agree fringe conspiracy theory groups, think lot fail look things reasonably objectively, take theories fact without demanding harder evidence. However also think important people educated real conspiracies, important people stay informed inform others them. also think good push people believing anything word conspiracy bogus, could result people becoming complacent understanding extent powerful government corporate people powers gone conspire immoral harmful things they've proven throughout history do.

I definitely think complicated thing fine line walk there's radical difference promoting conspiracy theories evidence proven conspiracies hard evidence. guess best thing would teach people proper critical thinking skills look things objectively without jumping conclusions able look ask evidence form level headed opinion. There's always going people easily manipulated lack critical thinking reasoning, believe they're indoctrinated believe, refuse look things objectively.

I think stigmatizing word conspiracy necessarily right way encourage people that. encourages people look anything word conspiracy around bogus outlandish. kind like throwing baby bathwater. sort like saying news propaganda certain news companies purposefully skew information manipulate people. can't tell people news bad believe news, would counter-intuitive. like make motorcycle helmet laws? guess could hurt still became law unless I’m mistaken. theaters catering idiots politicized masks. realize soon left lot people out, I’m going anywhere doesn’t require masks. Wonder states common... curious- get tested? fever symptoms? even clear, wore mask, banned. I'm Arkansas. Thank God Mississippi! can’t imagine painful you. Please seek help. Unfortunately, think number people everywhere America ages think hoax damn high. hospital beds 10+ hours apart driving  Maybe paid defend every piece shit propaganda posted lost interest? mention today biggest national celebration Sweden means people drunk instead. basically comments going removed political...on post political rally.

Should entertaining. I'm curious - [for-profit nursing homes Ontario markedly worse COVID outcomes government-run true NY/NJ? Made China... Trump: let show botch federal response pandemic!

Bolsonaro: Hold caipirinha... honestly think Trump wants biological bomb. 

It’s interference election. can’t lose it’s delayed cancelled. Testing isn’t what’s filing ICU beds! No, Us locked down, slowly reopening good control. sane parts. anti-science bits crazy. gotta get gains, tired risk coronavirus due obesity. 'Merica winning long time! 

/s obvious think pull through. Somehow. missed part clearly things benefit others. isn’t working assumption virus won’t infect protesters? Give enough rope... Lt. Governor offer people tribute/sacrifice covid-19. Disney World resorts opened week Disney World parks opening next weeks.

LESSSS GOOOOOOO!!! ok, get it. That’s actually dropped chem trails first way spread it. run small movie theater I'm looking non-politicized, information-rich PSA encouraging face masks legally show films. suggestions?  Yes purchased ticket far advance know masks going thing. option? willing listen anything hide corner time. 

Death tragic, one argues that. cost important you? Screw money. money mattered would never closed things. 

NYC losing billion per month broadway shows closed alone. Screw money. 


Could 244k die Florida. Maybe it’s likely. 

Yes people die. Could close million next several years. 

What alternative? Also consider Amsterdam lot infected people. day (testing finaly became available anyone wanted get tested), 0.0009 % tested positive. 800.000 inhabitants, means whole city like 8 persons carried virus. quite likely nobody protest Covid. dumb. Increased testing DECREASED cases would good thing. means fucking virus spreads like wildfire highly infectious. consistently enough area, sadly. 10 plane crashes worth deaths day since like April one gives shit. sick days accumulative? That's strange policy true. wonder people hoard them. many days could possibly save make dent retirement due date? 

Personally job 12 days paid per year minor illnesses, colds flus that. carry anything per year. 1st day self cert anymore need doctors note. Also company doc available need certified free. 

Plus serious illness get full pay 6months followed half pay 6months. Social welfare year think, around 208euro per week. Possibly quarter pay year I'm 100% sure know anyone long. read also.

So wonder bath would kill coronavirus them. honestly can’t see claims benefiting China. Wanna Thomas Paines ass grow lettuce. don’t even go store ! Around 90% death covid people preexisting condition. chances dying healthy extremely low.

It's looking stupid, uncomfortable. might sound vain none caring want uncomfortable see little benefit. data: texas

Yes, testing gone up. look graphs, sudden spikes last days way higher increase testing. highly doubt testing alone explain spikes.

But alarming new case spikes, increasing trend hospitalization. hospital systems overwhelmed, death going spike too. Right now, death flat, saving grace. ac technician visit house today mask coughing, go sanitizing beyond lysolinf surfaces? Lysol air? Open windows? What's actual exposure risk face face briefly? Mr. Straka said interview Thursday night medical condition reason didn’t wear mask.

I'm surprised honestly many people medical conditions let wear masks. yet hear medical conditions are. B Cells memory cells? education. flu sometimes cause coronavirus. Remember early concerned becoming seasonal? similar viruses prone so. virus like scv19 seasonal would terrible thing nation I’ll add one last statement I’ll leave alone,

The United States long enjoyed many freedoms built backs individuals sacrificed lot country, freedoms protected individuals fought country protect freedoms, protect you, family friends. changed life many cases gave lives make sure still country. 

The United States built making sacrifices other, flag represents 50 states came together order form perfect union. represents countless sacrifices people made even argument. 

If don’t care greater good that’s choice, don’t want wear mask, that’s choice.

But remember 2 things:

1. pain action lesser pain regret. Taking action saves wishing future 

2. People sacrificed lives freedoms country taking small step cover face go public help protect others disrespecting sacrifices made sacrifices made much friends friends. remember years ago study concluded Finland best country world. Finns do?

""Activist"" lol call morons t.r.u.m.p.e.r.s advocating lying medic condition try get away without wearing mask mandated. Half sub wants Chinese super AIDS. like there's anything interesting going anyway. Lol. fact seeing higher infection rates neighbors. ""**Wang colleagues suspect.

Yes, people might suffer life long problems. Pulmonary fibrosis cause regular pneumonia. difference COVID-19 generating lot cause serious pneumonia compare vectors (flus, fungi, bacteria etc). Thus people going discover bodies prone forming scare tissue disappear impede functional tissue regeneration. 

Basically let negative thought permeant lung damage damage actual damage disease itself. betting, would bet lungs fine year two. always smokers red life comes contributions public health. Italy shows excess deaths towards end February. 

If initially seeded cases December, spread cases wouldn’t significant weeks. maybe brings us towards end January, making increased deaths towards end February make sense. 

It seemed spread “so fast” places didn’t realize initial cases actually earlier, simmering bit. actually say 100 cases think “first” case, that’s significant growth. surprised. recent study long airborne aerosoled virus lasts air gave 6 minutes outdoors summer conditions. 19 minutes early fall/late winter conditions. 125 minutes without sunlight. 

Even 6 minutes within large crowd would seem enough time infect. night time protests would give 125 minutes time frame.  Masks would help plenty wearing masks. Something seem add Feels kinda germany. 


Its like 99 scientists say 1 + 1 = 2 one says 1 + 1 = 3 fuckedup reason half country wants listen single guy instead treating like dumbass is. HPOU already refused enforce [mask *before* weeks protest cops. can’t imagine they’d likely now.

Ok, 65+ still 4.3 million people Florida alone. That's 244k deaths rate $7.7 billion hospital bills. that's 65 die. I'm sure there's larger percentage hospitalized recover.

Imagine everyone wore beginning. Let's real though, one took seriously Febuary much changed since lockdowns ended. government continues fail people. Yes, people would scarfed regardless they’re ornery contrary toddlers. fucking load one?

Hmm.. type general mask use **likely** decrease viral exposure infection risk population level, spite imperfect fit imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing protection. **Masks worn patients may offer great degree protection aerosol transmission.**

Bad study make point
 one? people, half participate (~140 left). Also: **Using intention treat analysis, found significant difference relative risk respiratory illness mask groups compared control group.** 
 maybe one Journal American Medicine: comparison mask use, n95 surgical mask scenario noninferior. also extremely small one? test, says nothing maybe could look one CDC: your[ second more, see Oh wait another one: one interesting shows potential, end speak viral protection. maybe find studies use Maybe need another source: *Although material may provide physical barrier infection, mask fit well around nose mouth, material freely allows infectious aerosols pass it, benefit.*

Doesnt really support analysis keep going you’d like, feeling much comfortable pulling shit ass presenting factual, actually taking time informed given subject.

People could used scarves, etc. first mask homemade, blue vacuum cleaner filter.

They lot damage killed LOT people saying early masks anything. say masks work, everyone cover (mask, bandana, etc.), lot people would alive today. People supposedly charge peoples' health lying like utterly unacceptable.

Luckily, think lot Gen X non idiots outgrown well. He's pandering Gen X frat boys clinging past.  Dr Fauci recently commented earlier today: ""One problems face United States unfortunately, combination anti-science bias people — reasons sometimes are, know, inconceivable understandable — believe science believe authority,"" Fauci said episode US Department Health Human Services' podcast ""Learning Curve"" Wednesday. need retest exposed testing location. Y’all gotta move military funds towards investments teachers education. Isn’t USA known poorest education first World countries? ""They turn media days we'd never know.""

Haha, really got clue. Meanwhile, AMC Theaters isn’t gonna require face masks they’re afraid making political issue. That’s best way describe it. Intense charisma. Burr absolutely brutal time, people flabbergasted don’t know laugh.

He smeared Rogan wall, Joe laughed. could do? used say comment written like wrong. basically online discourse method zoomers. see issue politicized way has. Masks conjunction restricting super-spreader events slow spread virus major way, provided there's enough compliance. simple require drastic costly steps like shutdowns. noise seems coming libertarians think required wear masks restricts constitutional freedoms. problem argument liberty constrained one person takes action harms another person. infect one person, turn go infect others. risk multiplicative.

As second point, it’s bit like word “Why?”

You answer “why?” question always legitimate answer. 

Just like question Religion creator Beginning like God, eventually stop arriving something answer with, doesn’t mean isn’t answer all, don’t know is. 

But everything Beginning, even can’t understand is, feel least know answer particular question. 

Though agree next question one cannot hope answer, is: created Creator/Beginning then?

And like “why?” answer, goes on, on, on, first thing existence either Creator, thing able expand evolve less-conscious means. 

And like things Religion/Existence, don’t know. legend thank contributions American society.

i feeling gonna get revised updates CDC soon..... i've invented even 20 minutes ago they're already asking free ones -\_- exception queen creek. here's better analogy. Let's get rid young people since make less money therefore taxed rate. I'm tired paying 20% + year...... Damn kids 😂 Yes, actually believe one sub rules. title article is, ""Reuse N95 Masks"", contains useful information. 

The OP edited title, express opinion misunderstanding. 

N95 masks supposed used 3 hours. want use 8+ hours day, need plan using 3 (or more) day. day done, time decontaminate re-use depends method decontamination. various methods. Exposure 160F heat, example, relatively quick.

The article explains methods.

The 14-day figure time wait person might exposed, thing. Medicare. Ah. Yeah quite middle aged people hospitalized. Look, sucks, family going grieve anyway. families do, part life,

Yes, eventually, let's act deaths prevented now. reason rush people graves they'd otherwise decade live. 95% us catching never currently keeping alive, overwhelming medical system.

It overwhelming medical system that. also giving companies time increase production availability PPE hand sanitizer, giving scientists time learn virus spreads, giving doctors time develop treatments protocols improve outcomes patients catch it, also slowing limiting spread virus protect everyone including vulnerable. 

Hospitals alright moment, current hotspots like AZ TX risk it'll continue concern virus moves areas false sense security hit way
NY had. NYC beaches opening summer. Museums, Broadway, sports, concerts, dining in, gone.

Those handful things near infinite number things people do. Missing 6 even 12 months killing anyone. Another 1.5 million Americans lost job last week. 

and spread virus control people continue work jobs continue lost. Many places reopened careless rush return work closing again, continue reopening happens appropriate people continue take reasonable steps avoid spread virus. meantime, government's job provide disaster relief individuals unable work still need put food table keep roof heads.  date NYC following CDC guidelines?

Literally millions people [doing exactly Dating apps still full people meet. Virtual dating perfectly fine right now. Eventually, depending person's situation, in-person meetups still possible well. People put masks, meet outside, maintain distance taking part large number activities. People take unique situations account, example, two people live alone, get food supplies delivered, leave homes necessary wearing masks could eventually decide host indoor visits minimal risk anyone else. 

 impacts real, they're trivial socially, psychologically, economically.

The impacts real, they're also 100% manageable small amount patience creativity. They're also temporary, longer people try rush end lockdowns sensible reject following basic scientific advice like wearing masks social distancing longer whole thing gets dragged out.

I think safe say he's lost votes since then. come movie theatre shootings employees piss wrong anti-masker. buffoons.  lock people cages refusing wear masks? Brazil #1 coming soon. know him. guy’s prick. number deaths per day decreasing though, point lower excess morality last week average previous years.

Pure bullshit.

From linked Preliminary data Statistics Sweden showed country registered 1,524 deaths last week, slightly lower average 2015–2019, 1,569 deaths. 

From actual Statistics Sweden press According preliminary statistics, number deaths week 22 1,524. slightly lower average 2015–2019, 1,569 deaths.  happened week since corona eruption Sweden. **But expect number deaths week 22 revised 200, means probably still see excess mortality even week**, says Tomas Johansson, population statistician Statistics Sweden.

 

And really happened:

Here latest statistics Statistics 22 May 25 May 31. Go 'Tabell 1' sheet sum totals May 25 2020 May 31 2020. find total 1,620. That's 3.3% higher 2015 2019 average.

As Statistics Sweden actually said, preliminary numbers low actually excess mortality. Reuters simply chose honest Unless wanna go Conspiracy Land 

Is land Sweden reporting low numbers initially, revising upwards later one paying attention?... proved ""land"" real. Right id like know same, even considered make bill stop obviously bad decision.  open air, likely not. store (like aisle) smaller space, chances go up. best bet respect social distancing much possible. stay, minimum, six feet others wear mask, good.

Gloves help comes touching common surfaces, like doorknobs like. really concerned, might worst idea carry hand sanitizer either, sanitize even gloves touching common areas. Ah checked Facebook every 50+ year old losing minds Google updated setting page ""show covid notifications"" see setting phone. pretty clearly says setting something app downloaded.

Next up....I trust vaccine rolled out. week ago: it’s we’re testing

This obviously lies.  Yeah! It’s good practice hopefully nations stick Cancel round egg That's million-dollar question, right?

The short answer is: know.

Reasons for/against conditions getting bad NYC:

***For:***

(1) lot resistance towards sort ""re-lockdowns."" hard significantly reduce ""social-distancing interactions parameter"" Rt equation.

(2) Even ""re-lockdowns"", implementation likely slower March. takes weeks turn battleship regards daily cases. we'll turning battleship even slower time.

***Against:***

(1) age distribution new infections AZ, FL, TX seem skewing younger. favorable, terms future pressure hospital system.

(2) NY, CT, NJ started see daily cases decline got ratio ""\~ 1/150 confirmed cases per capita."" AZ, FL, TX honestly far ratio right now.

My calcs indicate AZ pass 1/150 tomorrow (20-June).

For FL would 9-July, TX would 20-July.

If AZ, FL TX roughly follow pattern, top current hump honestly may far away.

(3) NYC started literally ZERO immunity within population. AZ, FL TX populations least built immunity surge, February - May period. Every bit population immunity helps. Movie theatre dude busts shining flashlight you:

""Hey buddy - mask, movie. call pal."" Miss read comment say thanks posting I’ll pass. see saying now. month either right wrong US never locked down. basically reopening ignoring problem.. R whole capitol area became 1.5 Well saw well managed Amazonian forest fire. Yes, possible immunity permanent, making even foolhardy policy. way beat virus suppress spread.

I'm going go Karen someone wear mask. definitely think less them. think selfish. think misguided. definitely think manly all. I’ve never met anybody IRL legit anti-mask. 

I think many incorrectly assume you’re pro reopening, you’re anti-mask. 

I’ve said many times I’m pro reopening immediately, downvoted bc I’m supposedly anti-mask. Nah. Literally this. Like ""oh look literally whole world anti Trump"".

This common attitude, one lacks empathy, ignores available evidence regarding know poverty U.S. common attitude simple. us know better understand life full complexities rarely simple answers. also preferred answer makes people feel better. allows one accuse someone else moral failing, making bad choices, resulting poverty. choices repercussions, real world, things simply clear cut. believe people quick make moral judgements they're frightened. would frightened? many good upstanding people failing financially due fault own, means bad circumstances could befall us - we, despite moral righteousness rock solid work ethic could next fall.

Trying find whether worked one hardest tasks lockdown, couldn’t get straight answer anywhere.

“They don’t work.”

“They work don’t wear one, nurses need them.”

“They don’t work people don’t take properly.” (That isn’t mask working)

“They work, 15 minutes, there’s point.”

“They work, everyone needs wear one.” Good luck. Schools open September friend got tested wanted add negative statistic...and...he positive. Uhh. Mask evidence flimsy.

I’ve multiple comments removed “political” cmon sub consistent eh Reported - avoid politics read article today indicating covid anti-bodies may protect people 3-4 mos. that's true mean could pretty much forever? Well whole world. Europe SE Asia used common sense.

I live UK disgusts much fearful majority people wearing mask life people around them.

It's fucking mask. blocks people's breath. Partying going visit parents grandparents beyond incomprehensible. 

Yet people it. 

But forget.. Europe long here. Thanks. I’ll bookmark look time. Yeah, they’re quite interesting agree. Quite geographically exposed like buffer rest Nordics Russia always shown resilience, sisu. work where? also need factor needing car county. I’d love see people move back Midwest Appalachia, lived young professional weren’t enough people nearby set roots. Well, that's fun. already enough issues chronic high cortisol levels due PTSD, giving weight gain, high blood pressure, mood swings etc.. staying inside like been, even worth chance. Hopefully blood type Type O- Vitamin levels good supplements, enough buffer ever come way. LETS GO JIMMY!!

Bakker 2020 article say customers infected workers. Anyone know? Patrons ate inside pick anybody know? literally come single convincing argument research. Please explain bad logic was; I’ve repeatedly said find data unconvincing. I’ve worked research lab going 5 years don’t think I’m completely unqualified read articles. guess conversation going nowhere feel free keep fear mongering, it’s shameful. 4,100 Texas yesterday.

Yeeeehaaaaw!!!! started copying one posts here. someone gives hard time, say got work hospital covid unit wear protect others. Then, take mask watch em run Actually that's case, old people need sleep young do, old people trouble sleeping 8 hours, so, thinking need less.

Almost every human earth needs 8 hours sleep night. successful life less hours per night make right. smoking, smoke become 100 years older, mean cancer lie. greater demands normality lower acceptance far-reaching measures consequences. People accept much intervention again.

inb4 rest world adopting Swedish strategy future waves epidemics. Sure do. quick look post history show single comment irrelevant posts. 

I see many coronavirus posts masks/no masks/culture wars/flu/not flu etc... post anything redundant irrelevant.

But, post anti Asian racism, well...in view people need hear relevant issue.

Your prejudice transparent. braver really feel. complain shutdown pointless big surge. I've literally said family ""That point shutdown muppet!""

Except places world *didnt* shutdown also didnt surge.

So far nowhere surge. number deaths continues fall USA, things open back up.

And doesnt seem big spread massive BLM protests. chart one goes blood type ethnicity, shows native people area overwhelmingly type O, think many generations mixture much varied European blood types, would dwindled.

I'm really sure type prevalent overall first place, since recessive version. Kansas. updated them. &lt;Florida entered Yeah... TBH keeping close eye US recently find sad. said, (yet) bad could been! So, er, congrats?  access data test quality, neither you. presented false equivalence, again. Further, repeated use bad logic tells qualified decide good science bad science, reaching argue ill formed opinion.

Again, scientist presented preliminary data, common medicine, also news worthy. Maybe learn med school. problem schools reopening one hand noted young people risk mostly asymptomatic risk low.
On hand people wonder safe could 60 years old teacher spend many hours room potentially infected people. addition kids live schools come back home. point kids older parents granparents live outcome might good.

It hard call. big thing though cases going rise testing rising. real number need look hospitalizations deaths state. cases rise hospitalizations deaths drop, case increase testing. increase indicates increased spread. stay same, spread actually increasing lowered rate infect people less infect moving forward dropping number (this eventually become herd immunity).

We actual idea many asymptomatic/presymptomatic people actual hospitalization percentage infected new know probably least year. makes test numbers alone pointless statistic right without reading context &lt;Texas entered Heh. love living policy work cost thousands people's lives. also banned traveling every European country countries already traveling again. Human nature opened cases started drop great job. long would wanted NYC stay locked down? Totally agree, instead getting angry government lock forcing premature reopening, people angry lack support government help people survive. I'm afraid virus itself. I'm sensitive changes right world feels upside down.

Besides, lockdown Spain strict go anywhere grocery shopping two months, think I've developed worst case sleeping agoraphobia prior this.

Streets floded people alone stresses shit me, surely working retail help. Maybe see specialist. Who's though &lt;Arizona entered makes perfect sense virus transmitted via air, surfaces, viral membrane gets destroyed exposure sun / humidity.

Inside viral particles circulate around long lifetime, people exposed quickly get viral load high enough get sick.

Outside virus massively diluted swept away environment. Exposure elements degrades lifetime even virus stick something likely breaks infection risks lowered.

It follows I'm sure confusing it. going way diseases work...inside many times risky outside.

So going bar eating restaurant like worst goddamn thing do. 

Want survive... Inside wear mask. That’s face “What mean cases up? declared victory!” Trump stupid hill die on. Oh.. I’m sad still cases closed borders European countries re-opened businesses borders already. believe people get coronavirus somehow deserve it, find odd position.  
As children dying? elderly people?  
You really sound like simpleton. Meanwhile, America, it’s like we’re holding contest see much embarrass ourselves.  want point man governor tent constructed outside could meetings smoking cigars. Mad appeared proven wrong much? takes 3 second google search find Good maybe finally get Chinese leash. mean, mostly people chosen visit Vegas fun midst pandemic. put level thought concluded reasonable thing do. Presumably used critical thinking “skills” conclude mask unnecessary. lied?

I mean, currently telling truth telling anything, lie. governor killed Tookie. friends person. know friends hopeless vote 18... counter infection rates NC SC GA basically entire south.

The reason infection rates dropped NY due herd immunity masks. Thursday afternoon, one covid patient per hour came Gällivare hospital. responsible concerned resources suffice increase continues way.

The spread infection Gällivare looks set continue increase, according chief physician medically responsible doctor Ola Wulf, many covid patients arrived hospital Thursday afternoon.

#Eight covid patients right now


- afraid resources take care patients continues like next days. also switched summer [holiday] staffing today, makes even difficult us keep places open, says.
When comes covid patients, Gällivare Hospital planned five patients increase ten worst case.

- received one covid patient per hour afternoon already gone five patients. moment eight confirmed confirmed covid patients, still printed sent home two still contagious, longer need intensive care, says Ola Wulf, medically responsible doctor.

#""Don't understand seriousness""

Ola Wulf seen eyes many Gällivare residents realized sharp situation urges everyone adhere rules conduct, even everyday life.

- seen people respect rules conduct exist. business chain guard, queue entrance one family would go in, still whole family goes in. worries people understand seriousness despite massive information campaign have. understand we're inside walls hospital. can’t like that. freedoms double edged sword. don’t think opinion matters one single bit, keep overvaluing opinion. Tbh think that's point they're getting here. main point article wealth inequality afford lower grade housing, there's high chance good access green spaces important benefits come (with highlighted pandemic).

Many would wonder tyrannical governments digging heels wearing masks places, things might better, hard expect USA point judging acting 2 million cases duck wrong guy??? reference May 9th 80K Typical keyboard warrior commenting things fully understand. average joe’s won’t choice work won’t job them. ton companies running PPP stimulus/debt raising start this. programs ending tons companies burn cash 60-90 days that.

A lot people might see reopening think jobs coming back, temporary, soon massive wave bankruptcies failures small/medium businesses. reduce demand consumer areas like retail/dining/entertainment.

Lol thx. think could asked everyone cover face tho? Imo it’s easier explain people situation help part solution lie create narrative you’ll recall later. go through, cause fuck people lmao trump gettin dollllaaaazzz really understand

yes, great difference two, concering subject matter 

mathematics rigorous speculation. system reason abstract. 

physics study observable, is, definition, absolutely concrete, _not_ abstract.

_but_ physicists, progress, uses solutions mathematics provides 

and mathematics sources problems physics, albeit may argued math _can_ progress without physics, that's what-if scenario may place opinion, interesting scenario analyze NYC much dense avoid another spike. inevitable considering many people live city geographically small is. Gotta make sure get deep shit likely food itself, things like chopsticks, drink bottles, handrails, etc. Seriously? recently reading clause may actually matter. american voting public ultimate arbiters allowed President. Assuming US elected foreign-born, American citizen, political capital challenge that?

That said, would erosion systems already holding onto tenuously. necessarily disqualifier.  Lubbock, really low case counts sudden reopen things shooting back up. Nobody wearing masks, nobody asking people they’ve exposed, nobody anything. We’re fucked. Right? super confused second really looking forward effect pandemic movies.

of course, died people cannot work first amendment covers free speech right protest. family believes scientists inflating numbers get additional funding. 

I given clarification means. coworker said exact thing yesterday. I’ve stopped trying understand kind people’s viewpoint thinking process. I’m going label stupid move on. Old men wise credit 'pandemic response' one. masks, handwashing, touching others, strong concern personal health always part culture Japan, people happy ramp efforts avoid getting sick.

Pandemic cooled significantly yet practically everyone everywhere still wearing masks volition. Can't credit pandemic response much culture here. Excellent response. Still mad couldn’t use school back day. actually research like nerd. yeah....you probably want visit south jersey time soon.... read somewhere amount antibodies many cases little register tests available currently. long compliance threshold - say 80% - marginal gains increased compliance significant critical. Rt drops significantly 1, number infected drops pretty fast, we've seen much Europe NE United States. 

To clear, I'm pro-mask. believe enforcement - businesses fined fail maintain full compliance (or ejection) among patrons. gains police stop fine pedestrians may worth problems might create. Police-community relations already strained many areas - including NYC. everyone mask businesses, goverment offices, etc., people complying even street, gains harsh enforcement may worth it. Apparently guy make sure people die traumatised wounded spending months hospital. dog whistle showing, might wanna tuck back in.

it’s objective fact they’ve 50% peaceful that’s incredibly generous interesting seem people make assault weapons political issue Nothing quite like anecdotal evidence. realize people prison might able afford bail, could innocent. realize they're still human beings🤷🏽‍♂️ know, Biden elected...people going real shocked come January winter months worst issues national lockdown Trump refused do.  Sure thing lol. Lemme isolate tiny island Pacific Ocean still chances getting covid19. Yes it’s called blacXican !! 💪✅🦠👏😊🥃🦠 would give credit Japanese people, wearing masks time acting responsibly really depressing. remember Modi fan boys telling everyone well crisis handled India. 

In areas Kerela properly locked places, national government totally bungled response helicopter flyovers symbolic gestures.

I really hope wake get control India's population density. right, they're useless, they're fuel... Chinese machine need fuel.

The official tests run - least we're told - maybe shed better light it. Yessir guess maybe 100 days since decided pandemic. US long that. agree, feels lot longer 100 days.  long they’re silent come November noisy wish... Look rest world. Stop community spread lockdowns, track trace isolate. working surprisingly effectively requires much less hiding away ""let's stop hospitals getting overrun"". Given science data suggests actual benefit locking comparing countries states without Lockdown measures well spikes deaths weeks even months countries states eased measures

I'm quite sure hypothetical gains talking about. pay $25 hour wear thing day.

Then quit job go home. public wear mask. Ugh, calm down. say anything scientists, administration. (terrifyingly common) thought process makes sense consider we're already carrying around micro-chips pockets times anyway. go trouble virus vaccine phones already irreversibly tied existence already? Tell woman athlete compete man “identified” woman bone density linebacker. science that? shining example ignorance even know fauci is; parroting they've seen sub, guaranteed. Thank concerned, seriously. infectious disease appointment cardiology appointment past week so, locations saw patient-facing staff patients wearing masks. made uncomfortable. No, ton reasons someone may wearing mask Oh that's cool then. 10 people expendable. local store doesn’t even employees wearing masks...Lancaster resident article link May 28th, course new. would love see mandatory regular basis work. least available. fairly useless screening. could offered time.  absolutely nothing increased testing - CDC botched covered dump states, try take credit typical.

The deaths nationwide going down, also due absolutely nothing feds did. States come plans without detailed guidance support CDC, FDA, OSHA, TSA, Ag Commerce.

But rational scientific plan get deaths down, get number cases low enough could mitigate masks, increased testing, contact tracing. plan 90 percent first world following.

So instead plan deaths slowly rise week two. Trumpshakers don’t seem get absolute worst economy health country. least nationwide herd strategy would maximized economic output maximizing deaths. nationwide 4 week lockdown would squished October. Instead got interest rate cuts, tweets, 3 trillion giveaways. manly looking hooked oxygen tank either joe, musta forgot lose muscle hospital bed fat. Whereas European neighbors daily increasing death toll... There's good there's bad. Next time someone like gets elected president (for example), leave?

Oh, that's stupid argument make? Huh, go figure Japan started finding Covid cases approximately week Italy numbers never took off, proof masks make difference know else could Florida. amount tourists without masks insane. Memorial Day busiest I’ve seen while.

I’ve hunkered three months. get 6 more. Best case. Fucking morons. wouldn’t wear mask protect others? don’t understand true? watching days wondering? dad went Chicago back October 2019 compete Chicago Marathon. fell ill late October. really ill 3 weeks, coughing really badly 2 weeks. antibody test (paid £80 it) came back positive. makes think virus already America October issue industry DEAD AMC gone get revenue. holidays major revenue days theatres. 

I'm going risk think desperate play industry otherwise doomed end pandemic could year away. Stay safe distance tell cover nose mask. far away, probably means yelling them. leave restaurant without contaminated food. Meanwhile Italy still 40-60 deaths per day 

I ain’t buyin’ it, don’t think anyone else either think could lockdown completely eradicate disease? realise that’s impossible.

All takes one person 7.5billion people cause outbreak again. need measures contain outbreak worldwide lockdown. would stop countries like Syria, India? I’m sorry loss. comment misleading. I'm gonna act like know anything epidemiology, politifact says false. seem pretty neutral left leaning. seems started sub, posted Howard Dean. got national attention Twitter. double counting cases. Yeah. don’t think I’m going back Costco samples again. It’ll impossible maintain distance people insist getting them, fact removing masks consume make people really want avoid. It’ll suck sample cart right next something want buy, like giant bag tortilla chips giant pack cold cuts. feeling slow everything down. ""laid bed motorcycle helmet chainsaw floor nearby"" - CLASSIC!

 sucks, can't imagine hope get relief... really almost like thousand?s comments I've read predicting somewhat similar disaster help. Stop talking Sarah Jessica Parker else hiding? new, first reports device came beginning April.

There actually another company developing similar device Israel:

It seems advanced stage testing, currently 1,000 sample trial hospitals Seems like really depends store. giant yesterday people wearing any. Lancaster county Gender equal sex. Gender equal sex. two different words. 

No one saying alter chromosomes.

No one saying that. know arent. lying. know lying.

 Stop trying muddy waters using ridiculous straw man everyone knows false. pride. I’m sad ones follow rules, everything right still leave world early. ones somewhat abandoned leaders. current state that’s going wouldn’t surprised rest world laughing us. It’s embarrassing.

Downvotes guess cause morons.. eehm mean *legislators* see wave ""mask good train"" stupid herd follow.

Big brain time. What’s alternative ? hide away notice? It’s anti-trust, anti-science. Fauci told us wear masks February May want PPE supplies run out.

Maybe part fucking problem, Fauci. People trust scientists *they capable lying anyone else is*. like 5% people may serious symptoms around 0.5% even less may die heard 80% too, vaccine eventually discovered, 80% Oxford vaccine would work? clearly idea going vaccine process think administration much control it. Scientists develop vaccines, scientists research vaccines, scientists approve them. administration piece puzzle mean ability mess process. Dislike administration legitimate reason respect work hard working scientists working 24/7 bring world semblance reality. Yeah TN’s bad too. +667 new cases, 7816 tested, 12 deaths since yesterday. Oh, Nashville’s mayor said today moving Stage 3 reopening Monday 🙄 increasing trend still nothing crickets governor state’s progress reopening, merely expected increase, concerned, crisis. word would cause us backtrack reopening phases, though several independent counties along way.   Oh, one summer would great.

My faith humanity 1 year. 🙃 massive protests two weeks ago LA anything this? Cause everyone keeps saying it’s stores barbershops growing sentiment Fauci completely wrong contradictory virus? see many people say lately. There's reason religion survived long every culture: unfortunately selected society develop proper rational understanding world, people run feelings cause that's probably human nature so. Nobody ever said humans flawed find motivation getting done. either positive negative, I'm practicing social distancing + masks + sanitization protect others myself.

I happy chunk family, including godparents, FL, afraid them, medical issues already. Yea I’m Bucks I’ve literally seen one person store without mask even. infected county nation Rockland County NY. 1 25 confirmed isnt anywhere near enough slow spread, especially statewide. anything, number increase spread.

All herd immunity talk part false narrative refuted every respectable epidemiologist planet. reddit gonna stop pushing it? It’s higher rate exposure SARS MERS. 

I’m comparing antibody responses. 

But would horrible antibody responses ‘common cold coronaviruses’, provoke antibody response last four months. 

Ideally it’s like SARS. knows? don’t yet, haven’t enough time. 20s? Ok.

Sending kids insanely hazmat environments craziest thing seen. People wait send kids back public schools ( unless home schooled.)

All sanitation stations checks....seems little weird. becomes norm, yeah, maybe I'll change stance. year un navigable. Waiting storm pass. Literally told mod last week lol assumption people protesting re-open went got tested told agency protesting re-open. 

There seem post re-open spike, necessarily correlate two. Wow, second quote, could describing what's happening right now. guess things never change, huh? course socioeconomic problems result complex set factors, fact is, lockdowns major contributing factor that. can't ignored explained away. 

There's lots things government could done, fact is, didn't. expected would: giving little info possible expecting us trust safety best interest. It’s they’ve handled entire pandemic. Little communication. 

They put one company-wide letter beginning end April delineating new (weakly enforced)safety precautions. culture toxic. Upper management sends threats firings rumors spread. Rumors spread don’t tell us shit! Sorry rant lol  create jobs, environment, entertainment. areas enjoy people.

Point number 4 post interesting too. realize masks. think I'll take advice grain salt then. seems nation loves outsource government. wonder would possible sell government buildings legally operationally bullet-proof non-profit entity totally controlled local government? Then, would longer government building mask rules could applied without penalty. evolutionary advantages aspects ourselves.  Thank you, Arnie article literally book report coronavirus have.

Active cases per day:

However, writing felt unpolished.

""The south rise again."" new meaning. change rules become presinator? don’t agree politics anything better choice Whew... thought us rural country bumpkins dumb. news shifted rioting Americans care one thing time. two things infinite: universe, human stupidity. I'm sure former.

-attributed Einstein (probably misattributed) fan podcast since early days now, agree. stance covid sad. correcting giving someone shit retaining humility.

It's always right. Sometimes best conversation helping someone else wrong. think disproportionately affecting black people? listened experts shut us soon threat known we’d entirely different situation. Limiting exponential growth even day makes huge difference. 

Punchline: don’t know math I’d say most. There’s reason wealthy country decent health care infrastructure 4.2% world population, FAR dead, twice much, country.  It’s don’t consider 400+ years extrajudicial murder (pretty hyperbolic!), virus doesn’t consider. really doesn’t matter think, virus does. 

Although think hypocritical. think know hypocritical too, otherwise wouldn’t mention it. Ultimately protests would end people dead Coronavirus. think justified, call. Ah see talking nonsense here. I'm responding happen need break, go:

1.	Afaik disappeared virtually one arrested one. summon think eight people?
2.	I live China. learned new coronavirus 31 30 Dec, 2019. following days Chinese social media (particularly Weibo that's one check anyway) loads posts SARS-like virus, precisely people worried anything like SARS.
3.	It break national news officially evening 20 Jan. that, social media already loads posts virus, news, studies, academic estimates virus situation, well various posts related SARS, etc.q
4.	I started buying PPE 15 Jan think, time could see plenty posts people panicking making advance preparations bad case scenarios. 
5.	PPE getting sold think couple days national news. also remember people urging buying PPE online commerce deliveries would soon halted (18th latest think?) Chinese New Year.
6.	The outbreak happened right Chinese New Year. like Christmas (or plus Thanksgiving) lasts seven days minimum. People go back hometowns that's do.
7.	Wuhan 14 million Dec officials estimate 5 million _left Wuhan elsewhere China_, abroad. Coincidentally, fact cases reported places like Thailand precisely part made people anxious -- many people travel abroad Wuhan already getting two cases route, bode well actual number Wuhan.
8.	When Wuhan quarantined shut down, meant it. Absolutely one could cross borders unless special permissions. Airports shutdown routes. even caused trouble chartered flights repatriating foreign citizens airport closed even get _those_ planes there, _foreign governments_ needed go loads procedures negotiations. That's also expats needed chartered flights first place, absolutely way get there.
9.	Indeed, international flight suspended throughout China; would you? airports China instituted temperature checks passenger disinfection procedures. Coincidentally saw reports British citizens aghast British airports took special measure travelled China (Shanghai &amp; Beijing cases). I'd flabbergasted too.
10. maybe surprise most? period late Jan early Feb actually saw freest speech mainland China many people could ever remember. words mine, multiple media people journalists apparently wide consensus among online community.  ""That woman"" Michigan kicked ass
Thank governor.💯💯💯 incapable looking things feminist lens? 

Are incapable typing well? lot worse sustainef spread, fear closed borders. lockdown test-trace, Sweden would league it’s neigbours right now. (Which open 2 months) American Exceptionalism  look infection rates/deaths influenza/flu patients end last year year. roof. believe almost double numbers right now. Lol, actually? another lockdown happens unenforceable due fact people clearly didn’t like first lockdown summer, see another lockdown civil unrest. like 40 years he's lived country relevant. Family Physican Alberta here. 

Agree completely mandatory indoors public settings, shopping malls, grocery stores, indoor offices, public transportation, etc.

Mask use decrease amount aerosol droplets getting beyond mask 

Exceptions would bars restaurants, since going risk (and eating drinking). Indoors limiting capacity / social distance seating. However staff wearing masks go close multiple people. 

Outdoors general think masks needed since risk outdoor spread low due open air ventilation/wind. risk transmission catching coronavirus diminishes [18-fold grounds, hikes, non-contact sports outdoors, patios, etc. 100% capacity, restrictions mask requirements. 

The usefulness mask use outdoors would protests, concerts, festivals etc since people shouting/closeby etc. Go ahead check national stats. You’ll see [This may help.] manpower needed want would better spent billion ways would teams 10-40 every road crossed state line would easily thwarted driver saying headed work, hospital, moving new state.

You nothing actually improve anything.

You could instead guys learning medics.

You could guys making masks.

You could training guys contact tracers.

You could using guys build hospitals school gymnasiums abandoned big box stores.

Fuck could enforcing masking.

Here good sentiment John pavlovitz:

Non-maskers, isn’t personal freedom.

It akin choosing whether wear seatbelt—it’s choosing whether drive blindly crowd. It deciding place people danger along yourself. Saying, “If want wear mask, fine, don’t force to,” explicit declaration ignorance can’t won’t tell difference choice affects one affect everyone. 

This isn’t physical toughness, either.

One oddest phenomenons people flexing face pandemic, wearing mask proves toughness. It doesn’t. It proves don’t pay attention, don’t respect science, reject critical thinking, lack working empathy. It’s nothing boast about. Common sense least common senses.  That’s awesome people wearing N95’s (incorrectly, bottom band hanging loose facial hair), dragging face stick gloved finger mouth lick order separate dollar bills.

* making sure concession stands purchases continue flow freely ever consideration? even main consideration?

I dont even know begin.

You probably never understand leech others anway. Totally agree (for once). think political economic pressure. said, point also seems mostly symbolic since Swedes trouble getting tested (currently one Sweden get tested symptoms), able cross border. That's lie. Tenet comes 7/31 factoring size density. Even 50% - - leaves 4 million people without densely populated area. Yup, there's definitely inequality everywhere.

The two others.  adjusted reflect Sweden's population 10 million, country's total number cases currently sits 5,334 — dangerously close numbers U.S., currently leads world total coronavirus cases deaths.

Their approach systemic problem individual solution.

Governments shifting burden costs pandemic response individual less ability power negotiate safety public, employers, etc. Im even joking literally live Gällivare. It’s small place. believe thanks people giving shit virus chief. comment rule comments. anyone starts: yes yes know article announcement Denmark going let former Danish territories regions either 1. low enough infection burden 2. coming get test within 72 hours entry. posting illustrates bad idea is. hope Danish government walks back. said, since tests aren’t freely available areas assessments I’ve seen (such [the one DR day]( ) show areas quarantine areas now, opening starts seem like bit symbolic diplomatic gesture rather something worry much about. imagine hate speeding laws sheriff say going enforce he?

Despite corona crisis, Sweden hopes border regional solution Denmark Scans travel across Sound. efforts made difficult fact proportion deaths covid-19 past month four times higher Skåne Copenhagen Zealand.

Sweden rated Danish Norwegian governments. must visit Nordic neighboring countries. Danes Norwegians advised travel here.

According Norway, Gotland Swedish region sufficiently secure Norwegians. Skåne seem secure enough fit cross-border Swedish-Danish solution.

• Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde (S) presented Skåne's low infection rate argument border regional solution. points number deaths Copenhagen ""almost twice large Skåne"".

• addition, Skåne's regional council Carl Johan Sonesson (M) emphasized border regional solution would allow people Skåne, Blekinge, southern Halland Kronoberg visit Denmark - regions significantly less affected corona center Stockholm.

However, two arguments fallen. Swedish government longer advises Swedes avoid trips exceed two-hour drive. increases risk Swedes corona-affected regions travel Denmark.

In addition, death toll Skåne continues remain unchanged level, approximately 20-30 cases per week. higher actual death rates Denmark Norway together.

However, untrue say people died covid-19 Copenhagen Skåne, received intensive care probably become infected. comparison especially true period mid-May. development turned Skåne's disadvantage.

Since then, number deaths covid-19 doubled Region Skåne. nine deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Capital Region Region Zealand, two deaths per 100,000 inhabitants occurred.

All according official statistics Public Health Authority, Region Skåne Danish National Board Health. Denmark overcome infection different way Sweden. trend even clearer Norway, ten deaths occurred past month.

In case intensive care covid-19 patients, Denmark experienced faster decline Skåne.

At beginning April, Region Sjælland Region Hovedstaden ten times covid 19 patients intensive care Region Skåne. Thereafter, number intensive care cases gradually decreased Denmark increased Skåne.

In early May, patients became numerous Skåne Copenhagen. remained ever since. present, Skåne twice many intensive care patients whole Denmark.

Imo, think little early reopen indoor dining, especially around area know disrespectful people comes personal space here. would say least one week really solidify current state, literally takes one ignorant person.

With said also feat still know everything virus understanding feel like lot asymptomatic, &amp; mild cases getting tested think nothing. majority young adults thinking they're superman living like everything normal... see lot specific restaurant. even tested third population, even though testing rapid pace. see many people careless streets, stores, etc.. relaxing much soon, combine Cuomo ending briefings (very understandable) people going assume everything gravy part.

Sorry think stay cautious side, especially hard hit areas. got flees running NY start whole thing again. hope passes 14 day quarantine law fr. honestly understand seems exist expectation property valued pre-pandemic levels. notion land-owners held damage-free throughout seems anti-intuitive *and* broadly accepted.

And means little coming me, owning land property, assure would propose extenuation rent leniency towards 'agreed' upon sums. 

Reality smacking everyone here, ones profited shitstorm became reality, really silent enjoying much protection. people think masks tumor society. 

It's TUMOR!!! Finns use subtle form sarcasm hard foreigners understand.

Real Finns would think talk whine much. agreed Despite lock people still generally careful. Sometimes media tries make seem like nobody gives fuck. ya government shitty either way cause chosen lives money without even trying lockdown Best time go shopping always morning weekday.

What asshole. People social-distancing possible lot stop spread virus. countries like Finland got fine without lockdown. areas hit hardest first take show stats people virus weeks dying, essentially virus survives within clusters spread much create new clusters. 

This studied years lot unknowns still, perception get virus got Stockholm early since Stockholm major transport hub region - know first cases Italy Austria. Swedes culturally socially distant general, big first outbreaks occurred immigrant communities northern Stockholm (also confirmed). also population group overrepresented shift-workers (the type move many facilities) nursing homes, explaining also hit early.

Beyond seem virus spread much beyond clusters, leading uneven distribution viruses spread. explains Stockholm's numbers high rest Sweden numbers par Nordic countries. shows social distancing far important tool preventing spread, restrictions encourage imposed early enough country prevent massive spread.

Again, perception situation hand, something needs studied detail think works starting hypothesis. anything high levels cortisol *doesn't* exacerbate? mean, good study, think anybody really surprised results, considering known bad basically every part bodies already. living one politically divided times American history main boy came said masks good idea. understand intentions save masks frontline workers ramifications statement likely cost people lives.

But also know virus behaves differently ships ships different.

So, definitely got valuable data two ships, medical community needs research. -Wayne Gretzky state pretty much open since June 5th places like Philadelphia, havent seen spike. June 5th 2 weeks ago. roughly 130+ viruses circulation humans one point. worse others. Healthy people get sick anything. think going die? experiencing placebo affect, people underestimate power placebo affect health perception. last time sick this, bet can’t remember guess probably felt pretty shitty too.

It 100% affect anything. need put context. Yes affect you, probability? floored. :0 20% actually low. back April. communities high So? mean Nazi?

Yup. it’s coincidence [each evolution make look like police officers. Even though lied, front line workers ones needed save lives people already infected hospital. top protect continue help treat sick. 

As others also mentioned, look many people resisting experts local governments policy wear one. guy charge enforcing law, refuses enforce law.

Why asshole looking work today California? makes even ironic early phase pandemic, Cuomo threatening sue states like Rhode Island telling people New York license plates self quarantine... hope sarcastic..

If not... 'true king doesnt say king' California reopen Trump administration GOP refused provide federal aid. Backed corner option. Mexico testing anyone active cases coronavirus? number active cases continues hover around 20k every single day, number recovered cases keeps climbing, along deaths. going there? Part problem ""wearing mask"" means. Nose exposed count. Mask chin bra count. Around neck sort necklace count. Fashion accessory perhaps mask. 

Pennsylvania like California Texas late recognize current reality. culture different Japan's. much greater self personal community responsibility actions. America's motto literally ""do whatever fuck want America.""

It would never work. dude reddit basically told fask masks help virus starting. clearly common sense helps somewhat stopping transmission. seems people rely news media much throw common sense tells many anti-lockdown peeps actually concerned economy. wanted stir shit stuck others SHEEPLE. economy resume almost fully. wear mask. nope! mAh FrEeDoMs said didnt life.

Anecdotally nurse friends saying cases spiking seeing come hospitals much less severe cases coming March April. Don’t come. I’m Myrtle Beach one wearing mask. It’s ridiculous. rare person wears mask wearing wrong. first link. “Among samples collected without face mask, found majority participants influenza virus coronavirus infection shed detectable virus respiratory droplets aerosols, whereas rhinovirus detected virus aerosols 19 34 (56%) participants (compared 4 10 (40%) coronavirus 8 23 (35%) influenza). shed virus respiratory droplets aerosols, viral load tended low (Fig. 1). Given high collection efficiency G-II (ref. 19) given exhaled breath collection conducted 30 min, might imply prolonged close contact would required transmission occur, even transmission primarily via aerosols, described rhinovirus colds20”

If spot displays state hospitalizations, apologize Florida, dashboard checked said publish current numbers, total numbers ""so far"". 


I agree though, ICU true covid hospitalizations true sign things spiraling...the instant uptick, assume going get worse couple weeks (and fact assuming anyway due cases getting extra beds ready put away.)If bright side cases, 20-29 group making huge chunk them, likely need less hospitalization. also might help overall immunity. good excuse yolo behavior, looking silver lining shit sandwich... could easily another 80,000 deaths covid, yeah? uh, know word means? literally made fun gender next post brought climate change. direct response that.

COVID-19's biggest point transmission droplet. standing next someone talking minutes chance spreading droplets, high risk coughing sneezing.

Now think bars. pointed out, indoors higher risk there. Second, start grabbing bottles hands putting mouth. Maybe someone passed bottle? Oh, go cigarette, short someone hands one... lighter. light cigarette put mouth.

Think droplets hands did. 

Masks work. Six feet distance works better. Handwashing works best, biggest risk bringing droplet contamination mucus membrane. law locals hate... preventing people getting sick altogether. Everyone getting virus depends when.

Just reminder. least Britons must follow social distancing. logic off, man. Come on.  
People accept risks smoking cigarettes. choice make smoke.  
We drive cars; yeah, could accident, get work, get store, etc.  acceptable risk. 
Yes fast food crap, people like it. go buy it, stuff fat faces. one forcing to.

Why present science everyone aware risks benefits etc ? testing 37k peak May. Last week tested 30k. don’t know weeks numbers. never understood appeal Joe Rogan. He's always seemed like snake oil bro takes seriously. Even stand preachy /r/im14andthisisdeep style comedy. hate guy get appeal. It’s like masks effective again. he's wrong objectively, I'm defending  W.e second account good luck click baits. Would nice see stats testing done extreme harsh border control China (yes, even citizen), think many people willing travel abroad damaging thing he’s pretending it’s now. taking seriously short amount time thing made supporters take seriously too. Obviously I’m fan (see user name) Democrat President trump people would never believed serious would seen way conspiracy stuff. 
I really believe Hillary anyone else would rely science always portion, perhaps 30%, won’t accept what’s happening.  rolled back everything’s open. Restaurants open bit now. |: city, 8 community outbreaks week, said would take 7 week slow reopening. It’s full steam ahead. Yay. Make amendment. president. Arizona California. Black people give fuck masks tbh. TriHard Clap Lmao weeks long :D keep fake info kthx annoys me, especially law student precedent literally everything, pandemic, absolutely one seems thought leaning lessons SARS MERS necessary, starting scratch right.

Precedent great guide, yet I'm baffled despite disease bing SARS covid 2, one thought going worked showed promise SARS place start.

Nope, instead first thing antimalarial drug Yeah, virus spread perfect math. one endangered.  He's drama queen  back? true .  havent downvoted but...OK. 
Then downvote thats it? dont get bro right move, good luck enforcing California. Ever since entered phase 3, every delusional jack ass thinks shit over. hardly see anyone wearing mask go out. workers wearing masks, customers seem give zero fucks unless establishment enforces it. extent, yeah does.  see you, Michael Scott. Underrated comment know hell trying say. make sense. meant immediately assumed saying didn’t believe science, completely overlooked point trying make - people religious worldview smart. You, instead, said, goes, “my head sand, head sand, ignorance bliss!”

And know what? Maybe that’s right. Maybe ignoring dumb arguments “science = smart” “religion = stupid” this. Clearly, trying actually conversation wrong, screaming ideas people’s faces matter they’re interested right.

...and don’t arguments random strangers internet going bed. 14 days? thought 2 days 2 weeks rate symptoms? appeals populist sentiments.

You give farr much credit. politicians political commentators times, besides that, he’s barely political all.

Either way, I’ve always thought populism positive connotation. understand 
Any transfer rate 1.0 paper exponential someone recommend good ear mask extender product like lot reviews say they're short end putting much strain ears. Oh look noodles1972 pushing party line, I've never seen before!  MOVIE NATIONAL TREASURE!!!! business. Someone ignoring guidelines putting danger business. Correct, blind ignorance painful watch. Especially corrected go saying crap posts. 

The whole ""we know anything China"" bullshit tiring, actually mean want know anything China. like put thier fingers thier ears go ""la la la can't hear you"" people actually try tell something. different place? Yes masks less coronavirus! problem wearing mask entering store people. problem ordered government so, point gun. ultimately government orders backed point gun, makes political. government advising wear mask versus ordering completely different. motivational poster worked now- hopefully try seriously please ban nuh uh, masks secretly suffocate ppl death cant possibly help thats doctors worn forever

because scientists sed like science masterclass. want learn that, still continue respectful discussion. Fuck church man. Religion cancer. know they're cryptic, answer 60 percent samples studied closely related virus prevalent New York, traced Europe.
Thirty percent samples belonged virus type largely unique Chicago, closely related virus China, study found. It also notes that [the second confirmed case U.S. Chicago woman traveled Wuhan, Get down! There's virus there! Lincoln Nebraska here, different honestly. Maybe even less 1 5. Often like 1 10 less. kinda varies Significant partner... Meanwhile PRESIDENT USA: CHYNA FLU! everyone bringing money table, sellers respond raising selling price. still competition buyers, buyers suddenly money, nominal price goes meet demand right back started.

The thing happened student loans grants. College expensive government started handing cheap money. Colleges responded raising rates far faster general rate inflation. Can't wait til class-action sue anyway can’t CUCK TUCK! 

It helps various idols worship act like ideological mouthpiece megaphone idiots flock comfort. unique COVID-19 virus spread Chicago appears link directly early outbreak China

So guess “unique” mean strain China. don’t care celebrity, care want job people actually see responsibility rather “seat power”. We, country, lost sense responsibility, sense respect life, overwhelming drive better around us. need people races creeds, regardless political/religious/gender/sexuality. human, respected “golden rule” underpinning society again, money. “Well, look cat dragged in” say exactly? backs every government order. within 2 seconds Reddit pushes like people care. listening True Anon podcast today. good point back April entire media telling people wear mask, even INCREASE chance contracting covid19. Wtf that?  Ok agree. Thanks clarifying. Greenville exploded. Guessing lot Charlotte area. Charleston growing right well. Guessing that's due factories reopening well tourism. Myrtle Beach exploding tourism. things obviously going slow anytime soon predict cases going keep getting worse worse awhile. India seeing spike people careless. State governments also feeling handicapped due rising number cases (but take away responsibility providing best possible health care facilities people can, turn, help people tackle less serious cases effectively).

Though another lockdown contemplated, India can't put lockdown people earn daily eat daily. Prolonged lockdown affect poor class would left worrisome amount capital. People ""have to"" learn behave play minimal role Covid-19 spread. Yeah criticize them. Got problem it, Mr. China-flu? Forcing people wear masks violating Second Amendment Rights, wear mask public carrying Firearm lose ability carry firearm...

Many would wonder tyrannical governments digging heels wearing masks would mean disagreeing Tangerine Toddler. nitrile gloves, check harbor freight store. hand sanitizer, sometimes amazon germ-x 32 ouncers. Good thing sherrifs security guards. asking employees making minimum wage enforce mask order.

I demanding orange county Sheriffs, make average $200,000 job enforce law. wait republican convention! Lots towners crammed together, passing virus around, return home town spread there. Craziness. Says senator still collecting six-figure salary. There’s interesting academic reports sub. quit reading news back March went straight pre prints academic reports such. may 270 times C packs nasty punch. Usually viruses mutate become less deadly hopefully dies quickly. Unfortunately, Joe Arpaio running sheriff again. Yep Regan bad enough. Glad learned lesson. like dude whose name six letters devil Moar freedumbs! tacticools! That’s inspired post. Old Billy “dude don’t wanna start bullshit” burrs Mostly giving hard time Myrtle  thanks sir stating this. don’t know simple protective measure became politicized. hope people learns statement understand easiest bare minimum way protect fellow countrymen women. It’s barely inconvenience wear mask public worst, helps country fellow human beings. hope people take head. always there, pandemic reveals uglies Think old teachers are. kids going pass along wipe ton them. man sure affect kids seeing teachers die must asses seats. spike goes afterword, rise. 

Impossible call something 'spike' passed. learn countries seen infection rate gone down? didn’t happen automatically, took big effort required everyone in. 
But honestly think impossible US culture, centered around individual. I've heard people suggest that's nothing compared economic fallout locking down, excuse saying lockdown never happened. rights infringed required wear pants? say... anyone doesn’t understand toxic masculinity is... peak. many men buy infect others? Sleep repairs body. getting sleep older adult find way get 8 hours min..... Yes Wow. hope troll even right wear mask, somehow, major asshole shit right there. 

Tl;dr - fuck asshole ""SHUT NERD""

""OK know all""

""Well look who's studying""

Lol Also unique strain Trubiskyvirus Masks disappoints rap community? glorification violence, drugs misogyny? 16 321 964 tests conducted (+330 267).

32.7% new confirmed cases asymptomatic moment test. funding Wrong :)

Oxford SARS vaccine already development. currently repurposed COVID vaccine. That's EXACTLY conspiracy theories work, different chemtrails lizard monarchs...

I personally know several people who:

1) think coronavirus completely fake.

2) masks 'seeded' rona.

3) one people believes *both* above......

The thing people common they're male, 60's divorced. guess boredom got holy fuck wild watching fall sanity train last years. 

I used consider one good friend, cannot even entertain concept vigorously denies holocaust... i'd consider normal cool guy five years ago. :( pointless. Either way people going go since virtually everyone apparently “bored/tired/done” pandemic. Combined distancing dramatically reduces transmission. You’re right saying staying home much better, unfortunately time come gone people attention span mosquitos Every time hear covid news SK, I'm always amazed detailed could pin point exactly cluster is. wow. Lick dick, maybe I'll let later good job. trolling? That's another hasty generalisation. happen know millions people? think area common, take granted got get stupid ass laws fixed pandemic happening. government control scientists America  Graph right cumulative, graph left shows 7-day average daily new cases. steadily increasing Sweden, dropping European countries. Lick taint. Sometimes it’s worth punching wall break hand Good bot I'm curious businesses masks work ? can't think occupation requires expose mouth except maybe dental stuff. Things like checking fever would cases. Youre asking wrong guy case, said reopening without regulation stupid seems agree. Mandatory Spain inside spaces, outdoors can't keep distance. $100 fine. really enjoyed reading one side exchange. faithfully upvoted side. awesome! they're human beings right. 

It's important anything ever said. Well, don’t agree masks certainly reduce transmission point people going go anyway since general sentiment appears pandemic “over” Trump got bored virtually everyone else decided follow. official number undercount. doubts ever, lied asses love blowjobs?  Well able blast me. I've yet hear good counter argument. one issue?

It bode well character, come along take shit say why.  listen 15-20 interviews really enjoyed Terry Crews Jaime Fox ones. Even aren’t fans them, interesting interviews *is* good thing blindly believe wikipedia. point exactly Im going report apps contains covid19 words related words. Especially apps google invest in, See google going respond. Masks fine, don’t work number businesses, businesses cannot stay closed vaccine found. what? mistake US made lockdown, actually implementing strict lockdown nation-wide. virus completely stopped early strict lockdown proven New Zealand Vietnam. virus eliminated least low numbers time get PPE requirements establish robust test trace methods open back confidently keep virus contained, Hong Kong Taiwan proven. 

The US never implemented strict lockdown, even worst-hit states. implemented half-hearted lockdowns massive, established community spread. they're current situation. already did, called live streams linked dozens above. problem live streams state that, otherwise argument even making. gave cute anecdote, raised dozens livestreams first hand anecdotes making, prove point watched them.  going make go rough video video youtube show close minded this, since ignorant lazy yourself.  reason elementary google search confident base defend wrong give live stream know see people without masks. without even reviewing content first myself.

It’s anti science bias, rather lack trust institutions keep failing us. Re-opening mostly happened protests. test went ""Oh, lockdown starting work, idiots want haircuts better give now.""

And states actually tried. went ""sure, lockdown even though cases lol, week"" re-opened right started cases.

Basically states stuck dick right gun barrel. think might something going wrong thinking area Qatar old people going godlike tracing? 10 years? realize supposed take breaks fact mask-wearing turned political debate leads believe human race survive next century. many people seem ride anti-intellectualism train think otherwise.

Personal opinion. 

Also I'm pretty much opposite things, care believe me. I'd care didn't. assuming takes one know one. Masks keeping social distancing enforced possible seems like effective solution curve flattened. states like California done matter. Yes, think it’s likely keep cases down, sharing true numbers. are. infected COVID, regardless die, many counties are/were classifying COVID death. smallest amount research you’ll see this. counties started correcting clearly stupid procedure death counts COVID went 25%. That’s still lot people dying COVID. Quite countries allowing travellers Japan.

I mean, kind reaction responsible gloss Jones lying position, claiming victim shifting conversation selfish journalism? 

Oh he's technically *agreeing* Jones, he's technically wrong concerns journalism he's shifting conversation way majorily benefits Jones (and Jone's vierwship) persecution complex. 

On surface Joe Rogans guests seem well mixed look hood see people like Jordan Peterson less six seperate times. leads least search algorithms think he's got something typically listen like guest, covid stance haven’t heard anything radical.

The way Rogan operates natural consequence - need listen treats people want listen implications things leaves uncommented. Play stupid games... KING Nobody fights government seatbelt requirements...

Please don’t disparage Spain. united states society built selfishness, come surprise people anywhere else put ""their freedom"" front ""everyone else security"". reason never free healthcare, many people think right pay less way important right people die minor disease they're covered insurance. fact always mass murdered, personal freedom guns always outweight risk mass shootings time time. people never get things would make free. there's less poverty less desperate people there's less crime, wich reduce personal need gun cause less people around robbing houses on. hearse always wins. automatically make expert? protesters allowed without masks kind social distancing .( I'm peaceful protests) man really dig scary shit nowhere...

now I'm deeply disturbed. 'no you' Eh see risk. China able stop virus dead tracks India same. Join club joking? Lol happens get fine refuse pay? Would forcefully take jail? confirm, lingering symptoms 4+ months hahaha yes! hey, hey, look fucktard! *Groans*  may evidence mutation cause deadly could reason sharp increase hospitalizations. COVID-19 mask wearing crowd killed people virus has. actually feel annoying wearing mask. someone debunk arguments wearing mask? anti mask person argued 2018, 1.5 million people killed TB masks required. person also argued CDC estimates mortality rate 0.4%, masks unnecessary. Racist? cannot serious . rural areas don’t even someone front checking anymore half employees aren’t even wearing them. there's learning bias think: let's say tell fire hurts you. people never put hand fire. put hand fire learn, spend rest life touching fire. seatbelts, need probably die, there's learning process. completely fine wearing till not. covid, wear mask get it, go saying ""see, need mask, virus hoax"" till get it. point either die, get result seatbelts, recover, develop antibodies longer need wear mask point. Running man Mars “hi from” somewhere works though. show place say hi different attribute place. holds true even place. :)

TL;DR - It’s “Canada says ‘hi’ north“ it’s “Canada says, ‘hi north’” Well, I'm fucked. Great. Makes sense Hope product becomes successful hope affordable enough. New gadget added the"" carry around"" list. Damn bro. patronizing, stop defensive However, don’t think Jordan Peterson would qualify one Joe’s problematic guests. 

Jordan Peterson imo great example problem Joe Rogans podcast, taken solation Jordan Peterson considered acceptable guest. Unlike Jones, used sane he's speaking within professional limits I'm certainly going question authority. individual appearance probably justified looking big picture, kind audience Peterson draws addition moderates youtubers/podcasters/social media influencers quote invoke him, Joe Rogan adds disturbing list people skim Petersons popularity profit good public discourse.

It's hard argue viewers wanted Peterson, harder argue audience *needed* Peterson life. that's I'm pointing issue Joe Rogan slowly driving podcast problematic direction making populist choices informed insignificant amount radical viewers listeners. 

Taken stream stream problematic podcast, great highlights. sum parts add conclusion. Peterson similar problem, agreeing multiple times legitimise people like Ben Shapiro appearance problematic conservative media platforms. hold ""meditations nature human hierarchies"" much wants turns around shows alt-right thoughleaders, he's saying one thing another. Which, I'm going snarky second, seems thing general. 

And different matter actually think Petersons ideas mainstream, least I'm struggling think position I'd call truely unique underdog get enough deserving (!) attention without Peterson raising it. personally argue falling public radar particular loss. long prolonged contact? example: grocery shopping actually safe? See parents (with mask) @ 20 mins? Thoughts? Great. Y'know means? Public funded bailout.... Yeah. don’t think bad majority African American folks. 

So, care one hundred percent objectively wrong? proud ignore data contradicts belief formed without data?

You find sad way live life? Rejecting possibility better informed form better opinions? think best estimates fatality rate approx .8-1.4% Yet another attempt destroy CCP reputation work. US mad coronavirus China! really testing much?
That's absolutely incredible real. yeah look looks like fun TY! Wrong decline least four weeks probably longer since lockdown. Source: Chicago response makes sense but...cool. riots protests breeding grounds bad orange man events?  Unfortunately little separation two. Given people deserve wrath would also end receiving it, morally obliged inflict pain them? also problem incarcerated Innocents. Since found years later invent also obliged subject general prison populace horrible treatment? 

For country supposedly founded Christian values find treatment prisoners quite unchristian. I'm going hospital weekly tests. practically empty. Covid would 1 2 hours waiting line tests. I'm person there, every week. Better Newsom that's saying much sake country, hope. millimeter 2?

Uh, droplets range 500 nm visible-with-the-human-eye, that's breathing, speaking, coughing. millimeter one million times size nanometer. point overwhelm hospitals. Little things add up

What SARS?! know Chinese scientists traces Corona Wuhan right... Navajo Nation stated going 57 hour lockdown. can't compute lockdown shift whole timescape 2-3 months Nothing else achieved. complete failure. high recovery rate less death rate due factors government actions. Stop licking. loved movies know talking Arnold. 

Stop listening media destroying America Crappy band starts playing. Haha Folks-- mystery political issue.  
For forty years right-wing media telling people government always incompetent, trust science, experts, academics, embrace conspiracy theories.  
There's reason millions Americans paranoid logic deniers-- right-wing media. Honest question. know governor california while, actually good it? Kind unrelated post something I've always wondered. Ok Karen. Get yourself. Wow, aware two cases reinfection, none died. Seems like know. Y’all cute, obviously forgot vast majority Florida votes Red every time.

Stop utter nonsense evil northerners, FFS. It’s born bread Floridians Ocala Panhandle everywhere make Florida is. Everytime look chart confused. Chile prevailance blood type? challenges Google skills too. France, too, still dozens per day. even Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, even Portugal, Romania Poland; countries never even reached half Spain's peak nearly 1,000 official deaths per day, still report daily deaths Spain. amazed anyone could take Spain's numbers seriously. 
Keep cats inside dogs leads avoid coronavirus spread, say scientists

‘Increasing evidence’ animals pass Covid-19 humans, says UCL report
By Henry Bodkin, Health Science Correspondent 18 June 2020 • 11:30pm

Cats allowed dogs kept leads order avoid coronavirus spreading households, scientists said called widespread testing animals.

In article Lancet Microbe, experts University College London said ""increasing evidence"" animals pass Covid-19 humans.

They urging systematic surveillance animals prevent build-up virus ""reservoirs"" could prolong crisis.

Their concerns follow culling 10,000 farmed minks Netherlands infected animals suspected transmitting virus least two humans. handful creatures visibly unwell.

The new intervention latest salvo debate surrounding role animals raged since start pandemic.

The UCL scientists say researchers prioritise studies investigate animals susceptible Covid-19 pass asymptomatic. Human transmission virus people showing symptoms one potent factors hindering control pandemic.

Laboratory studies suggest Covid-19 could transmitted numerous animals spike protein, attaches host cells, uses protein found many species.

Professor Sarah Edwards said: ""There's urgent need widespread surveillance, testing samples, preferably non-invasively, large numbers animals, particularly pets, livestock wildlife close proximity human populations.

""More laboratory experiments small numbers animals unlikely give us evidence needed confident certain species entirely safe, making major surveillance work real option here.""

Her colleague Professor Joanne Santini said: ""We need develop surveillance strategies ensure get taken surprise large outbreak animals could pose threat animal health human health well.""

She added virus transmission animal populations could ""become irreversible"" left unchecked, could ""threaten success existing public health measures"".

The scientists said cats could pose particularly high risk spreading virus households ""efficient"" carriers roam far home.

Infected mink reared fur found 10 Dutch farms. incident strongest evidence far animals pass virus back humans.

Experts believe that, originally infected humans, outbreak among minks spread different farms via wild cats. Antibody testing Netherlands found significant minority cats infected virus.

The US Centers Disease Control Prevention acknowledges cats, dogs ""and other"" animals infected.

The body updated advice, telling people let pets interact animals people outside house.

In New York, several lions tigers zoo tested positive recovered fully.

Prof Santini said: ""There increasing evidence animals catch SARS-Cov-2 people, might subsequently transmit people, know much risk area study prioritised.""

Testing coronavirus animals efficiently done analysis faecal matter.

The Lancet paper comes staff chicken processing plant north Wales asked self-isolate two weeks 58 cases coronavirus confirmed. Production halted 2 Sisters Poultry factory Llangefni, Anglesey. Good luck that. Denial hell drug Yeah, is. I’m sorry citing here, I’ve yet see single medical scientific journal, organization disagree. Like I’ll accept science medical focused source, like dozen doctors trump trotted front media. Yeah, desperate really options. Typical boomer heavily indoctrinated cmmnsm. empathize you. anger justified.

Yet hand, society determine better monsters not. think are. terrible, doesn’t justify cruelty sake cruelty.

In opinion, anyway. worked factory like (same owners) treat staff like shit surprised happened factories. store also provides hand wipes. fresh one might work.  State police first wave ~~part deux~~ pla-teux.

Idk French. I'm trying something, anything here. actually good point employees. something theaters bring worst people. 

I booth one Friday morning first showing Fear Loathing Las Vegas film got built night (Chriiiisss) screwed one automation cues film start playing trailers cue went TA-10 sent signal end credits. Close dowser switch non-sync music. caught mistake sixty seconds everything went back normal. 

But ten seconds actual picture sound missing guy lost shit ran lobby losing screaming. Platters dude, can't rewind film. Well, kinda could would take 15 minutes here, shut passes. guy thrilled tried break booth cops ended coming. 

Oh, brilliant people would throw sodas port glass. Good job. stop movie, find goddamn 30 foot ladder, climb clean glass, crank heat warm August day punish assholes. 

But yeah, chance hell would ever try enforce mask policy. never even bothered trying enforce outside food drink policy. 

But would go onion caught laser pointer theater. pass, permanent ban, full-stop. huge strain southern states sure. going well working. Well actually doing. following guidelines areas. seeing record cases hospitalizations every day now. God weird people getting old Local here, FB filled people calling mask wearers social distancers “sheeple”. Seniors primary reason DeSantis Governor...I think wanted. catches virus like preachers defy virus, hold mass, catch it....rallies good idea man.....I wonder thr protesting anythinf decision Shaddap politicized Spanish government decided alter count political reasons.

They saw going hit 30,000 mark soon (in reality well 40,000 - again, far country grossly underestimated death toll), artificially lowered 29,000 27,000 ridiculous excuse ""removing duplicates"", adopted new ""counting method"" made daily deaths drop 50-100 0-5 overnight, order ensure circumstance would reach 30,000 official deaths. *And shamelessness hailing publicly fictional zero daily deaths ""great result""!* farce unworthy democratic, Western country. Yeah infinite not, observable universe sort revolve around / perspective. No, mean China say China. tl;dr - *because travel blog!* Shit man. I’m USAinUSA sure hell wish back Melbourne right now. It’s one things immediately read voice Lets hope really think police going worry masks right now, they're attacked jobs is? Get grip. cathartic fuck, needed hear shit. show us credible source weeks long riots? Even better used alarms public areas. *holier thou* askreddit post point came well, understand say so, really elaborate further. Ultimately conversation concluded basically granting equivalent voting trade schools well, lack training uniformity among trades brought issues. one knew enough make suggestions. 

Curious gives impression anti-intellectualism ""frighteningly widespread college educated circles well"". Also, think common less common non-college educates circles? booing im right fucking retarded would really like see one. U think strange require 35 years citizenship, native born people get bit head start it. innocent desperation selfish irrationality different? guess one pitiable. warms heart see Arnie straight telling Donald absolute moron. Yeah use can, today store without misters. looked water use find any. wasn’t disagreeing main point. However, don’t think Jordan Peterson would qualify one Joe’s problematic guests. cannot deny people find Jordan interesting presents certain ideas differently typical mainstream voices (right left). It’s surprise Joe often height popularity. 

I say fully cognizant stupid things said transgenderism related issues. saw man speak live couple years ago said nothing related things generate controversy media. hours-long meditation nature human hierarchies. Extremely interesting. think would hard sell, including either political party. Weird saying sort shit drives views Joe Rogan. Kinda weird, think? Like maybe telling people Joe bad source info overall would effective that? Kinda weird. never would thought happened many people know believe come craziest wall shit. one hell hoax whole world putting create downfall US. much effort whole world trick us. get attention away things going push agenda. trying kill us making us wear masks people going start falling dead streets. countries wearing masks many years. falling dead streets. want give us vaccine computer chip track us. already phones living rock? family members friends. clue thought way. literally believe it. Lesbians  Please let true, From: majority neighborhood. provide facts/sources? snarky comment serves make look like prick without backing claim(s) all. like darth plagueis wise Shitty rhetoric question aside, yes, death rate Sweden higher neighbouring Nordic countries, no-one arguing that. obviously true. What's point?

I'm also carer (but elderly facility) impossible staff place like good day outside pandemic, staff sick, quarantine work becomes impossible. PPE lacking elderly facilities home carers. I'm buying much Amazon go back work next month nothing. Absolutely nothing :( increase cases young people, due carelessness, virus mutating, like Spanish Flu did? Sorry wasn’t blasting anything anyone promise. mmr vaccine life tho. Sure, they'll get right that. mean also launching investigation Sweden nursing homes cases deaths mainly nursing homes, general population. people even watch news? understand news divided US, refrigerated trailer dead? Really? really? WTF Merica? I'm guessing PA too? LOL irony open state. kept lockdown place increase testing remove kind noise. ask think wearing gloves helping you? 80% folks wearing masks estimated number needed get R0 1, sounds right based numbers we're seeing Minnesota cities large scale protests. Unreal. doubting sharing information different part state No. got trained something took time good it.

Sorry bad english. communities isolated enough independant. America few. 

It's really ""isolation"" thing. example, Ontario less 200 cases per day (14 million people) capital Canada (1 million people) 60 active cases (like 5 new per day). isolated, government really good job taking seriously. Never said is. Questions start investigating:

How people get positions power controlled colonialism?

How common practice inside outside Puerto Rico?

How corruption law applied past? proceeds say population follows measures

That also obvious lie simply due number infections. Clearly lots infected people still close contact others, causing become infected 80% figure adherence.

Which means 1 5 people adhering measures. would suggest people infected virus ones likely ignoring measures thus percentage infected people ignoring measures probably higher general population.

If (for example) one person every household adhering recommendations, basically one is. person goes becomes infected, likely infect everyone household - whether follow recommendations - well members public. people thing and... 1000+ cases per day. proved argument make claim need provide thw proof. Alright hear mate ones making pandemic worse. guess outdoor sporting events okay then. companies this, non issue. Broad testing available every county. Monroe County live, testing limited. Hey now, Centre County here, even friend friend it, though still new cases days. mask adoption seems quite high, even among guys go camo mask among Amish. (I hear complaints Walmart, think cracked down.)

That said rural/conservative counties around parts may different story. even rural areas here, though couple places State College/Bellefonte. can't transmit human human

Yes, easiest way end let kill weak enough die. like plan.

I either - that's exactly plan. plan would be: isolation/distance/masks elderly, let everyone else go business normally get immunity. know everyone repeating notion. virus. going change everything permanently. far worse public health concerns past people learned live them. find viable vaccine eventually, everyone accept risk, like everything else dangerous. safety conscious society longer used accepting dangers like past take getting used to. play them. guess sociopathic misanthrope paying off! really socialize happened. Outside protests nobody wears masks, nobody washes hands entering store, nobody washes grocery carts. talking about. he's cool it. Seems acknowledged worked better himself. That's pretty good. Well, never really goal get herd immunity. main driver behind us handling way (and still do), lock feasible long run. Look rest world, opening borders hope tourism taking off. strategy was, still is, keep social distancing long necessary. still work remotely, restaurants keep customers least two meters apart close down, people use public transit unless absolutely necessary.
And plan continuing measures summer, fall, winter possible next year well.

I've definitely used health subreddits purpose too. try browse randomly He's real American patriot knows MAGA. Herd immunity occurs 70% population contracted virus. percentage US now? 3-4 percent?

Fuck. hope someone help understand NY Times Graph that's tracking new covid cases deaths. According graphic cases flat rising slightly (6%) past 14 days daily deaths fallen nearly half (45%). means one three things. (1) number infections going due increased testing we're catching mild/asymptomatic cases; (2) we've improved treatment fewer people dying; (3) we're beginning upswing (although seen that) expect deaths rise markedly next weeks. missing something? Turns human contact good health. knew?! Yes others pointed that's what's going on. like...

Day 1... 10 tested. 1 positive
Day 2... 10 tested. 2 positive
Day 3... 10 tested. 3 positive
...
And on.

If say true we'd see constant rate positives even better smaller rate every day. we're seeing bigger percent infections... Indicating problem getting worse 

Even they're right.. means hitting brakes reopenings infections personal hunch 14 day incubation period slightly off.

It's almost like making statement political. Hmm could, excess mortality Tokyo April alone already exceeds number total reported Covid fatalities Japan, excess mortality Germany roughly line official Covid-19 tallies tell make rich happy cheer ask ""how""? 

They've released data, is, one wants jump bandwagon again. 

wait proof hope studies back up. Jesus man, clearly trying make false claim people certain views wearing masks riles people people protesting black lives matters ignored. People mad protestors breaking social distancing orders without voicing opinions social media. stupid think one recognizes ignorance displaying. Oh God right, every time. say. Maybe Fauci give conflicting advice week week people would trust more. admitted lying public masks. WTF wrong you? read? know, part putting food water him? hope able find different material mask style comfortable him. imagine people spectrum could hard time explaining mask hard wear, making situation even worse. Oh wow! Hollywood Elite staying Corona Crisis Code. shocker. FOH! wife named christina? Well, hate break better two weeks ago according numbers proved elsewhere thread. Better good better. Sorry seems upset you. like less people dying getting sick. Sorry that. meant autumn 2020. Yup. culmination problems we've ignoring. Ok yes agree, realistically, virus mostly spread close contact. odds catching public isnt high long keep distance time. Also, due relatively low mortality rate, isnt much justification keep society completely locked like China early on. something going live hope cure comes soon. Indoor vs outdoor. 

We see. Well that's true well. hand, belief 60 70% number needed herd immunity. 60 70% get vaccinated equivalent herd immunity, least booster shot? agreed gotta florida, texas? know beachgoers responsible outbreak, right? Going beach help economy restaurants bars open near beach does. Guess activities causing outbreaks?

I live Florida disappointed situation handled, engaging science denial going help anyone. People free outside (crowd-controlled!) areas wearing masks necessary. study proves case covid-19 particular? agree. almost like someone paying act certain way. Hmmmm. IANAL importantly problem.

Trumpsters lying medical condition get wearing masks assholes.

American Airlines asshole company.

It like marriage made heaven. literally made other.

Lying trumpsters going get settlement.  Oh fuck's sake! GG ask fellow Texans. good run 😤✊ graph [number new positive cases versus number new tests clearly testing. Testing FL peaked around May 20-23, leveled off. rate new cases shooting since beginning June. Anyone know protestors covid infection rates much lower expected? Watching videos protests looks like many people aren’t wearing masks close other. rate 1%? source? Oh, forgot again:

When said first second wave, meant second third wave. Vaping deaths last year suddenly more. yes, covid19 reached critical saturation point USA. Lockdowns, contact tracing, etc. etc. work anymore.  thought manchild made exempt... read study said virus last lot less (I believe 30 seconds 3 minutes) surfaces. know surface spreading isn’t main way, help. totally anecdotal, know someone first responder moved end May. ended moving Saturday Monday developed symptoms Thursday tested positive. exposed 15 people Saturday Sunday one got beside SO. I’m starting wonder asymptomatic spread may rarer thought. Obviously studies need done, I’m cautiously optimistic following proper procedures keep bay. Yet DeSantis adamant it’s mostly younger folk “migrant workers” turning positive, thankfully aren’t vulnerable populations would need hospitalized. He’s joke. Baby step happened months sto already vaccinate coronaviruses animals. I'd say require financial hardship privilege procure in-home medical equipment home medical care. reach many people, though. Potentially severe claustrophobia? doubt many people bad enough though. Mob mentality != popular opinion Almost like alcoholic....  think 2 genders well? considered mental disease based articles read.

Why would engage new debate already gone full Karen science denial first? callous. depraved indifference state towards life citizens. Full stop. 

It remains astonishing nakedly immoral much been. Doors already open, can’t close again.

-AZ Governor worse. It’s inside, using recirculated air, people screaming yelling hours. believe say, I’m glad Trumpists this. believe see imagine hard flight attendant fight keep rolling eyes said that? Okay. big numbers. like it. strange hill die on. people really need get sanity checked. Conservative activist. fixing say stupid asshole?  real story live right street CFA. Every time I've there, employees interacted wearing masks. purely politics people refuse wear masks. stadium matter...it something supporters latch onto repeat ad nauseum. So, think itself? give us ideas comment useful ones  outside. outside + mass masking (a large % protestors saw livestreams masked). 

Compare Mardi Gras LA thought increased spread there: Lol one point downvoted -3, wasn’t you. worries! definitely can't continue it, amount money involved crazy. nyc around 50% revenue property tax alone. imagine rent/mortgage getting paid either property taxes.

The fed gonna something fast, unemployment losing revenue states gonna bankrupt across country. States, housing banks crash time, bye bye stock market.  Thanks. Someone else posted national metric actual data helpful. FTLOG, let house? fuckface solely try generate outrage. He’s “former liberal” like Candace Owens “former liberal”; someone told come Jesus moment goes public make money. He’s another grifter. kinda did.

Walmart’s stacked UHD 4K TVs entertainment systems $1,200 stimulus. get masks work.

Great, agree they're necessary first step. Let's move second also get airlines concerned improving filtration quality cabin air virtue signalling.

If virtue concerned signaling protecting lives, signal away! yes, cabin air filtration definitely needs work, there's whole issue US Federal Government's absolutely arcane regulations result near zero airline profit margins, forcing increase passenger density absurd extreme (read Hard Landing sometime context) preventing forms competition.

But yes, totally agree need work things too. Masks easy win necessary, they're end-game. rich hired personal chefs, dieticians, personal trainers.
Also HGH, possibly. Pretty sure find statistics support viewpoint well. 

Then so.

Are costing us money top pandemic, making people loose jobs money etc... 

But yeaaaa right. urged masks social distancing cases.

Lol good thing that. likely would’ve prosecuted anyway

Have paying attention? Oh great, see shades ""It's darn Hispanics' fault!"" coming DeSantis, enough racist issues going on. tired narrative. people don’t whole lifetime experience somehow don’t know risks rewards interacting others/going public places carelessly able whatever feel like isn’t freedom, anarchy. free means protected degree. Mask laws protect moist breath, thus free. highly infectious ? couple days max incubation period really enough time say impact. That's virus outbreaks work.

They've gotten one positive test far, know sort community spread could happening result even small number people gotten protests. 

Look reopening dates Florida Arizona, everyone bragging increase cases 14 days reopening month starting see impact. Arizona currently ranked #23 terms per capita deaths, 17.49 per 100k (Pima county) struggling. Here's latest case/death Doesn’t mean can’t health conditions heard can't ask condition ADA, would like reference negate rumor.

It's easier get mask requirement be. Unfortunately law can't help us much making sure people wear masks, trust society right thing... Fuck. party truth. Everyone else committing wrongthink *that* Italian she? headlines misleading; patient's BMI looks high (without direct measurement) that, itself, predisposing factor toward many health problems diabetes hypertension. Still sad story. shouldn’t laughing, but... could American?

The ability fly airline? ... ok trolling. Oh, really? try:

* Driving past popo seat belt texting

* Running around without pants undies

* Going shopping barefoot

* Bag deer without permit

* Sell food trunk car

See mandates work you. don’t take lightly either didn’t think would anything confront them. yelled “fuck asshole” didn’t want stick around - probably would exposed. petition make 'Brandon' male version Karen honour total Karen. Spain stuck death toll long time, even though still getting cases. Ya gotta pay troll toll get social media manipulation campaign!

Ya gotta pay troll toll get in!    What? weird dude man haha  edit, understood. wasnt one downvoted immediately. Actually people ignorance hearts minds, yourself, *do* harm people. Everyone around them, fact. stuff going US believe last weeks... “Terrorist” I'm huge fan idea no-fly list, mind labeled people ""terrorists"" added no-fly list. !remind 2 weeks California added benefit masks fashionable...

At least western half state. eastern half full rural morons. probably lost left one another bet. one hand though, TSA completely useless. Whoa whoa whoa, First let's solve Hillary's Emails problem. One thing time. He’s gay conservative. another gay guy, fuck dude. Zero respect gays support Nazi GOP. fired dereliction duty? He's paid uphold law no? work short time TL;DR:

- Hospital accused manipulating tests shower lower numbers.
- positive tests, strongarmed management different test labs would accept, knowing would skew numbers.
- Tests done ways would result ""false positives"", instead positive tests.
- Nurses terminated tests. excuse doesnt like wearing masks. ONE likes wearing masks. Modern medicine works. Also way taking vitamin supplements modern? think we’re going see pitiful turnout. It’s going mostly empty. Also, read virus takes WAY cell body flu does. Yep. saw similar effects Boston area. Virtually everyone masked, people taking things seriously general. visible spike protests, daily infection rate continuing literally crater.

This virus magic. outdoors particularly great place spreading it, similar many viruses category. Wind brutal (even feel it, air currents outside strong), UV kills it, etc. forced close quarters outside, wearing mask still wise though. news article super vague duration (and like saw tried look things), linked study concrete numbers, that's good know. Looks like stay active month refrigerator cold enough, that's unfortunate. Good thing I've sanitizing packaging, least. Maybe I'll stop getting lettuce, though.

Thanks sharing link :) Scandanavian countries get lot hype. least America think idolize Sweden, Denmark Norway little bit much. Coronavirus done good job humbling countries - sweden example - revealing ugly truth matters, take USA. 

This personal view point. People protests actually wearing masks. I’ve seen protestors even handing masks people didn’t one. got banned flying American. Lol. kinda, mean all? AstroTurf campaign convince anyone, fact seeing people walk away party Honestly pretty sure first wave states. delayed it, didn’t stop it. NJ compliance orders waning since April least. Yet cases still going every day got hit early hard. thru already. Strangely enough less densely populated part state peak 3 weeks north part state, made question rules effective Yeah, 1% protesters turn positive low amount spread you’re state today total 3000 active cases statewide (0.05% population). current Florida spike tied back Memorial Day weekend. I’d expect protesters infected wouldn’t show another week 2 they’re killing citizens actions, duty stop them. 

They are.  definitely like Private Citizen Arnold much Governor Arnold bendable wire embedded top part mask conforms bridge nose. improve seal reduce glasses-fogging. literally governor California eight years

Yes, I'm sorry, point making there? People stores. according states website 80% cases 2 isolated counties rest homes. idea Thank god wrong Birmingham... Put sign retail business says ""No shirt, shoes, service"" people understand non-compliance means service. Tell wear mask suddenly infringing rights. Go figure.

To refusing wear mask think hoax, infringes rights: you. protecting health public. FaCeBoOk sCiEnCe sAyS oThErWiSe Trying get herd immunity. Maximizing deaths medical solution cares. wear mask yourself. wear protect others. unknown concept US. see genius bright future government agency. Imagine brain thinking global conspiracy. I'm sure come better test ""the likelihood conspiracy true inversely proportional number people conspiracy.""

This way beyond faked moon landings, probably bit beyond flat earth. Idkwtf wrong people, ::cough:: Obviously higher testing made numbers triple duh ::*hack*::... stop test CuRVe! Easy ::cough:: peasy. ::cough:: ^::cough:: ^^::cough:: ^^^::cough:: ^^^^::cough:: 

I Ain't wearin' mask Got Goddamn Rights! ::choke:: Muh thyroids? cases leaking state too. live WV, four clusters four different counties linked Myrtle. course none quarantined got back vacation, getting ready see spike managed infect within next days. hard bias point anything various branches Government, CDC say. lied human human transmission, lied face masks could stockpile themselves, they've lied drug trials pointless political purposes. Every single example gave different.

You seem stuck one.

Which interesting.

I'm guessing robust Benghazi post history still trying justify ignoring deaths. Look Vietnamese boat people, helps explain Vietnamese presence lot unexpected parts US. *inside airplanes?* Karen grocery store scold two near nearby women wearing masks. “It doesn’t kill people age. educate yourselves.” Meanwhile, people flocking back bars, pandemic. fall going bleak. appear virus spreads much better indoors.

That aside, here's Oregon's latest chart cases/deaths:

 Oregon currently ranked #47 terms per capita deaths, 4.38 per 100k population:

 average 35.34 That's good business sense. Sweden's reputation continues spiral toilet..... good riddance, knuckle dragging trash. fucking sick mask wearing politicized!!! Like i’m fucking angry shit. You’re putting everyone risk you’re selfish asshole. wonder thing - places like NYC Lombardy, Italy much better now, mainly lockdowns virus pretty much reached saturation locations. true. going become like Asia, masks become fact life outdoors while. headlines Ezekiel Elliot “Multiple” Cowboys players tested positive. many players that? let’s say game weekend. Would fair cowboys play without players? 

If starting quarterback tests positive goes entire game plan. wear oxygen mask, freaking protected... It’ll play like injuries sicknesses happen every season. bet, I’d wager there’s cases percolating within population going undiscovered could lead another outbreak. 

The point comparison obvious. It’s apples oranges compare two nations. It’s reason Sweden strategy compared Nordic nations. several words get auto mod here. one post political automod far could tell, remotely political term used elec-tion according “bad flu season” Sweden led 505 deaths course year. sound little insane. course, us times. doesn't, legally. much I’m disapproving fly lists, I’d make exception choad. wanna p*ss aisles don’t surprised major airlines pass name likenesses around say money isn’t worth headache he’s likely bring. Frat brothers rape 300% non-frat brothers. 
Period. they’re superspreaders coronavirus. 

Studies schools without “Greek life” buildings conclusively demonstrated reductions alcohol hazing-related deaths, well lower rates sexual assault rape. 
Here’s small overview.  death count also underestimated? lol guy getting downvoted? say he'd attend movie without mask, attend one mask. reading comprehension yall ""Americans stupid"" stereotype lot truth it. Uggg, I'm sick tired Americans, stupid prideful people.... wish China would nuke better world! Authoritarian ideological sense means believe government able make rules apply everyone citizens generally shouldn’t question rules.

You educate authoritarianism actually functions.

Here go, pretty quick read:

 speak haven’t soon know! know six months. /s True. others said, yes Ontario (and Canada) testing lot. See today's epidemiology report province page 6 see testing going up, percentage positive going way (the exact opposite happening many US states). seriously tried quote ""study"" counted cars detect COVID? Gee didnt US, could solved test shortage long ago.

The interesting part car counting study cordinated media blitz pushing headline, like someone knew data come predate Chinas outbreak, want pre-empt muddying waters pushing Chinas date even earlier.. even best story could come car counting Huh yea, guess right, probably qualified statement little more. point Florida significant number immunocompromised people know adversely affected virus, seem agree with.

Maybe unhealthy, many states unhealthy, really matter? 

I go back edit comment though. We’re still first wave. Yeah, would love sports don’t see way avoiding situations. won’t surprised NBA plan gets tossed pretty soon. studies April said actual infection rate could 5-50x much. don’t link. assume current testing isn’t even close catching cases absolutely uncontrolled community spread. agree joke basically one prepared, hold every government account that, ultimately citizens would've complained year ago pissing away billions tax payer money supplies something that's ""never going happen""

as lack mandating them, hope nobody forgets many governments around world also decided follow outright purposeful lies initially, people refusing masks told 2 months ago scientific basis wear masks, people institutions held accountable parroting dangerous misinformation also. work six days week, 18 hours day health care shifts wear mask last 3 months. don’t want mask-up: it’s hard, people. rights aren’t infringed upon. I’m helping save lives. tho?
 
Have given legit reason not? Besides MUH FREEDOM? Interesting perspective probably means recently hasn’t wear mask, he’s also probably full shit ejected ass 40,000 feet. Crap, first time South Carolina gone thousand mark new cases year. Face shields quite good masks incredibly much better nothing. Upvote American Airlines! wanted add immunocompromised mean higher chance infection, higher chance severe complications said infection, still wear masks. 

I'm glad friends support network.  “Conservative activist” synonym “complete idiot.” Political delete. So? Would help check peoples temps? thought 2017 something? telling less 6 months ago? one arguing that, still missing point. tests leads positives, course, result decrease proportion total tests positive (if increases testing sole reason increase positives). 

In words, rise negatives would expected outstrip rise positives, increased testing reason increase number positives.

If testing more, seeing coincident increase % positive rate, strong indicator increasing transmission infection. Full face shield then. good mask far far better nothing. know, maybe fact beijin 50 cases shut entire blocks u.s. numbers rising people protest cause masks go freedom might something Got it, thanks. 
Still, sorry dick. OKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH)--The Plaza District announced Friday postponing Solidarity Plaza: Black Lives Matter event.  Europe long? I'm covered spouse's considered uninsured.

So officer likely didn’t contract protests, could spread there. contrary experts white house always reminding think time goto rally protest shit it!  dads work (construction) tested 10-15% positive almost asymptomatic. labeled outbreak apparently there’s 2 it’s outbreak. 

I say think lot workplaces similar situation might something chik-fil-a specifically wrong. maybe is, knows haha r/COVID19

Hi health care worker here.

Same. replying health care worker.

I'm sure finish reading reply came across way expecting restate.

All pharmaceutical treatments experimental here, degree, we're facing novel virus fully understand. I've said think agree point.

I never said prohibit experimental treatment. welcome confirm say that. 

I said cautious using experimental therapies we've already seen US that.

Are taking bold stance reckless experimentation health care worker? Flight attendant here. passenger day refused wear mask due medical condition. signed letter doctor, presented left alone. ask condition require documentation. Lack ears? GI tube? Emphysema? I'm sure there's *some* legitimate medical reasons someone might able wear mask. think that's what's happening here, however. It’s sad state affairs government decides actions taken protect military, serve protect Country, isn’t worthy action blog post medium.com still sell alcohol, beer.

LOL smh. Oh, that's rich... Conservative “activism” always seems take form trolling days. good her. hope doesnt get virus. jk idk you’re looking at, oklahoma cases hospitalizations rise. 

i’m pretty sure arizona voiced concern hospital availability too. Lots workers wearing public immediately pulling back. see Kroger time curb side. limited pandemic. 0.5-1% 200-300 million infected  not? Look photos. protestors wore masks.

This even complicated. Wearing masks saves lives. Period.  “Someone different belief me, let make fun instead attempting understand perspective, return echo chamber beliefs never challenged” mean.. least quarter US thinks hoax.. Sigh, circlejerk strong ever. 
There single movie theater/concert etc [superspreader events world. people meant sit quietly enjoy movie, pretty safe reopen. willing require speeding limits seat belts...If people,companies employers would get heads asses require enforce masks social distancing would able live thing till treatment vaccine. Darwinism course matters. US least supposed country laws (despite sanctuary cities). Clearly masks right thing - hard get council (or whatever one's jurisdiction) enact emergency legislation. time something right time fix it? Duh? Yet I'm sure corporate powers still make happen workers pay price. work"" - fauci

The scientific method provides system continous improvement error correction, based available evidence, prone change.

Ignoring fact never actually said ""masks dont work"", blaming saying something months ago scientific consensus back proves point:

That people like dont understand science. Standard thin tubes attached portable oxygen tank run nose? Yes, still wear mask those. Guessing around Occupy Wall Street... Seem pull opinion pieces go doom gloom outlook.  feeling going book own.. year started bushfires Australia, seems though we've forgotten it. even halfway year yet! I'm pretty sure greater 20 million people live Florida, mitigation 10k+ day happen, sustained. Assuming 0 mitigation, like 12-16 million infections would needed ""have one infect."" 

Now I'm saying mitigation, right now, will, predictably, happen continues. really 'sposed take criminals seriously? state's citizens running office jail? IMHO food payment handled similar long handled collection baskets church. Peron end basket (5-6 ft away) pushes towed payment
Then food delivery.

AHHAHAHAHAHA federal law it, jfc. Chemtrails 2019! Bill Gates' 5G RFID vaccines. Stick facts mate! Hahah sourcing talking points subreddit now? I'm going bet without reading.. reason is! Global pandemic... stop stupidity reopen parks playgrounds? They've proactive two reasons: 
- good overall corporate culture 
- fact many locations get crowded concert venue care others others don’t care us? left alone fend healthcare wages, aren’t allowed take vacations...

Americans aren’t like spoiled people countries nanny government making easier live lives. pretty sure ship breakers Bangladesh can't wait get hands them. Well cdc help. Faucci cdc said masks ineffective attempt stop people buying save health care professionals. lying instead telling us conservative made polarizing issue. two totally different trains thought based sources. sources can't keep fucking stories straight outrageous. Jeff Bezos surviving. can’t you? Holy shit, 10% positives testing?!?! numbers INSANE even limited testing, they're truly right tons testing available (spoiler, aren't) absolutely shitting pants right now!

Lots states 2-5% range, get antsy they're top end that. law literally impossible enforce exists reason jaywalking law exists, remove liability. 

People going wear masks much longer, they're already coming off. most, people wear masks public areas near cops minute go store they'll take off. Yes irony all.. said early - ""We believe individual responsibility""

Sweden regulating alcohol HARD. supermarkets, etc state run stores allow sell it. 

Smoking. Banned restaurants, even outside cafe restaurants. rent apartment, even special snitch line people smoking balcony. mention, weed never allowed. Never.

There hundreds dumb nanny laws Sweden. came Covid, say ""We believe individual responsibility"". hypocrisy. 

They treat citizens like dumb children cant make choices - (Of course benefit financial score easy political points). hard choices present nothing gain.. ran, covered asses left responsibility citizens. exempel, telling council small towns Sweden job score masks Ventilators, like compete whole countries.. again.. spineless shit ask me. Well, also remember age cohort dying virus. thousands school children suddenly dropping dead. average age death Italy 80 average person dying 2-3 comorbidities. think going shit show. shit show going people get scared again, everything shuts *again*. much want say it, believe sports, holiday gatherings, etc. fall fear scare tactics going continue override logic. agree school year too. probably going fucked again. heavily impacted last months assume fall. also live alone basically stayed holed middle March couple weeks ago, even visit parents ""most risk age group"". Enough enough. course. Everything life risks. I'm saying looked consequences infected coronavirus and, me, accept risks I'm willing take. that's looking potential personal health consequences. 

If catch it, I'm risk others society. catch it, I'm extending length pandemic situation. person catches extends clock little bit. help everyone, need snuff limit gets it. Even personally care experience disease symptoms, putting strain healthcare facilities society whole catch it. want part problem either. 

So... want risk life. want risk long-term complications. want drain taxed healthcare system, want risk spreading others. So, open back amidst continuing upward trend new cases, even people get sick? knew!?! /s believe Universal already open. Pretty sure test everyone there, everyone going symptomps might way people. likely 2 yea. Unless got slightly protest. easy get types board masks. start reminding facial recognition already use increased US. heavy overlap conspiracy/anti-government right wing. 

Here’s needs happen: posts facial recognition software needs circulate around FB etc. fights use abuse right shouldn’t hard find. right leaning articles blogs better. put idea every armed protester open movement logged tracked FR put database 2A activist. 

Then put anti mask movement psy-op discourage mask use US specifically problems cause FR. point police always masked protests. 

I’d surprised didn’t work. live masks disrupt facial-recognition technologies keep everyone safe. piece shit Asclepius

Ever since first read name first philosophy class I've able read Ass-clapius. 

Yes yes, fetch Assclapius Round mighty glutes. Anyone read accent memory B cells.

We typically think memory terms B cells since talk long lasting immunity often discussing viruses handled well B cell/antibody response antibody production long lived plasma cells bone marrow initial infection.

However, also evidence memory cell responses also react faster upon secondary infection. actually many types these, circulating memory cells blood, tissue resident memory cells stay site infection, others. also either CD4 ""helper"" cells augment antibody response (along many things) CD8 ""killer"" cells kill infected cells. Parks *not* everywhere US cities. one park neighborhood (which spans 27 blocks long 10 blocks across) years. One. filled homeless pedophiles don’t qualify homeless housing miami, anyone rent them. live public lands. It’s huge problem here. Needless say, couldn’t use park problem cleaned last 7 years. pedophiles relocated, city tried sell deeded public land developers build condos. Quite shit show. 

Aside this, getting park ordeal. hot walk year. get heatstroke trying, coming another neighborhood parks parks unsafe. Poor Ron drop ball unemployment, pick reopening drop following plan stop spread throwing blame left right sticks. activist conservative? progressive thing? Well done. 15% people 80 die. seatbelt analogy work car. People treat cars usually leisure time, simply getting destination. ask people wear masks time, outside restaurants people supposed fun going work. They're uncomfortable, hot, hard talk through, hard hear people through, taken drink/eat, etc.

The CDC estimate you’re referring ESTIMATE, “final IFR” claiming. yet supply peer reviewed study. You’re also putting words mouth say, disputing facts based science data. 


Once again, everything you’ve claimed nothing opinion. 


I love decided taking low/middle road opinion studies “wrong” apparently right fits narrative. freely admit may wrong, it’s possible state final IFR stage game. flat saying “it’s wrong, it’s high” laughable, like deciding “final” IFR 0.3%. fun making armchair predictions. continue treating patients real world using science frame world view should. Watching FL sure something. Mask mandates thing phased reopening least. drove around beaches weeks ago everything PACKED. amazing. meat packaging plants getting hit well? He's much creature nasty habits. competent response would lead cakewalk November. Losing president could lose support national crisis really kind amazing anti-talent. 

Coronavirus masks contract tracing fauci (so comment auto-deleted) 0.010344827586206896% population, following along home... obviously claiming half deaths people would died within 5 months. mathematically inconsistent studies showing average years life lost covid death 10. study implies half people die less 10 years life left, impossible get numbers like half less half year. 

So, someone lying. assume whoever wrote article, I'd really like know sure. Enjoy decreased lung capacity rest life get it. best info, sure look ""influenza-like"" data individual PDFs, confirmed cases influenza obviously Thanks reply. Damn right stick it.

I suppose see idea behind saving days much prefer time enjoy life instead banking possible future. Nice idea though healthy person, everyone else coming work sick I'm sure immunity take hit eventually. Especially climate extra worrying. Exactly. Look people survived Polio. need stop emphasizing death rate (which unlikely) emphasize long term health implications (MUCH likely). absolutely stop second wave happening. However, certain political party hell bent ensuring one.  I'd surprised US current state manages systematically anything. data manipulation, already know several states so. Haha, ya, right!

ISS, 18 giugno 2020 - Nelle acque di scarico di Milano e Torino c’erano già tracce del virus SARS-CoV-2 dicembre 2019. Lo ha scoperto uno studio via di pubblicazione dell’Istituto Superiore di Sanità realizzato attraverso l’analisi di acque di scarico raccolte tempi antecedenti al manifestarsi della COVID-19 Italia. campioni prelevati nei depuratori di centri urbani del nord Italia, sono stati utilizzati come ‘spia’ della circolazione del virus nella popolazione.

“Dal 2007 con il mio gruppo* portiamo avanti attività di ricerca virologia ambientale e raccogliamo e analizziamo campioni di acque reflue prelevati all’ingresso di impianti di depurazione” spiega Giuseppina La Rosa del Reparto di Qualità dell’Acqua e Salute del Dipartimento di Ambiente e Salute dell’Istituto Superiore di Sanità, che ha condotto lo studio collaborazione con Elisabetta Suffredini del Dipartimento di Sicurezza Alimentare, Nutrizione e Sanità pubblica veterinaria. “Lo studio – prosegue La Rosa – ha preso esame 40 campioni di acqua reflua raccolti da ottobre 2019 febbraio 2020, e 24 campioni di controllo per quali la data di prelievo (settembre 2018 - giugno 2019) consentiva di escludere con certezza la presenza del virus. risultati, confermati nei due diversi laboratori con due differenti metodiche, hanno evidenziato presenza di RNA di SARS-Cov-2 nei campioni prelevati Milano e Torino il 18/12/2019 e Bologna il 29/01/2020. Nelle stesse città sono stati trovati campioni positivi anche nei mesi successivi di gennaio e febbraio 2020, mentre campioni di ottobre e novembre 2019, come pure tutti campioni di controllo, hanno dato esiti negativi”.

Questa ricerca può contribuire comprendere l’inizio della circolazione del virus Italia e fornisce informazioni coerenti rispetto ad altri risultati ottenuti dall’analisi retrospettiva su campioni di pazienti ospedalizzati Francia, che identificavano un positivo al SARS-CoV-2 un campione respiratorio, quindi clinico, risalente alla fine di dicembre 2019, e ad un recente lavoro spagnolo che ha rinvenuto RNA di SARS-CoV-2 campioni di acque reflue raccolte nella metà di gennaio Barcellona, circa 40 giorni prima della notifica del primo caso autoctono”. 

 “I nostri risultati - sottolinea Luca Lucentini, direttore del Reparto Qualità dell’Acqua e Salute - confermano le evidenze consolidate ormai livello internazionale sulla funzione strategica del monitoraggio del virus campioni prelevati regolarmente nelle fognature e ingresso agli impianti di depurazione, come strumento grado di individuare precocemente e monitorare la circolazione del virus nei diversi territori, supportando le fondamentali informazioni della sorveglianza integrata, microbiologica ed epidemiologica. Bisogna evidenziare che il ritrovamento del virus non implica automaticamente che le catene di trasmissione principali che hanno portato poi allo sviluppo dell’epidemia nel nostro paese si siano originate proprio da questi primi casi, ma, prospettiva, una rete di sorveglianza sul territorio può rivelarsi preziosa per controllare l’epidemia. Attraverso l’attività condotta nei nostri laboratori, si sta sviluppando una rete di sorveglianza ambientale che può già contare sulla disponibilità e affidabilità di strutture sanitarie e ambientali di eccellenza livello regionale e sull’apporto fondamentale e la collaborazione dei gestori idrici che possono ancor più contribuirne ad uno sviluppo capillare e tempestivo”. 

“Passando dalla ricerca alla sorveglianza - va avanti Lucentini - sarà indispensabile arrivare ad una standardizzazione dei metodi e dei campionamenti poiché sulla positività dei campioni incidono molte variabili quali per esempio il periodo di campionamento, eventuali precipitazioni metereologiche, l’emissione di reflui da attività industriali che possono influire sui risultati di attività ad oggi condotte da diversi gruppi. Lavoriamo per dare al paese una rete di sorveglianza insieme ad Arpa e ad Ispra”.

“In questo senso - conclude Lucia Bonadonna, direttrice del Dipartimento di Ambiente e Salute dell’Istituto Superiore di Sanità - abbiamo presentato una proposta di azione al Ministero della Salute per l’avvio di una rete di sorveglianza su SARS-CoV-2 reflui, e già nel luglio prossimo avvieremo uno studio pilota su siti prioritari individuati località turistiche. Sulla base dei risultati dello studio pilota, contiamo di essere pronti per la sorveglianza sull’intero territorio nazionale nei periodi potenzialmente più critici del prossimo autunno”.

He’s thread too, surprised he’s top true, first wave never ends second wave never comes. like sue think workers compensation take care it. saying suspend mortgages evictions CARES funds burden post analysis. send you. leaders blaming others? always Dole. Seriously, months. Might die eat lettuce let take finals online Thanl Gavin Arnold. People rural county total dicks masks. Good thing it’s weekend, numbers always go weekend. one time event less issue people going everyday lives like normal. Especially prevalence virus low. 

One person protest could infect couple dozen people, isn’t great. it’s true protest bigger risk single smaller social interaction like business meeting trip grocery store. real issue many small interactions nearly every member society takes part them. Every single day. one infectious person might infected couple dozen people protest easily infect number people going lives (and maybe more- least protesters aware big risk taking precautions). right. gov't right demand wear clothing public, keep body yourself, many things. private entities stores. subject laws soon step foot public. way us citizens care quickly affect change isn’t reckless (ie: protesting)?

Something done 2 weeks ago. I’m glad see Orange County, FL requiring masks. Shame live county over. Well surprise surprise color shocked. Well people spreading vaccine conspiracy theories refusing protect public might fucking see wont Brandon Straka removed flight La Guardia Airport Dallas-Fort Worth Airport told airline employee **he didn’t like wearing mask**.

lol pathetic snowflake Reminds squirrels, raccoons, deer yet evolved behaviorally enough know avoid getting hit vehicles. BOO! lol chance reopening aborted, much $$$ stake... think South Korea lying? transparent aggressive contact tracing. South Korea beacon hill this.

China hand.... yea that's grade bullshit. saw that, another record broken there. Time Texas numbers soon, bet 4000 again. I've watching long time. go guests quite often actually hold opinions contrary his. try conversation them.

If scientist someone actually knows talking realizes really factual ground stand hold tongue. Masks much also protecting others, yourself, correct saying would rather ""Live Free die maybe kill others"". others said, laws place require wear seatbelt safety, also apply masks. love comment, shit's crazy Good. He's free build airplane fly wants. Herndon wrote Twitter “mutiny” flight Dallas Mr. Straka, passengers applauded Mr. Straka exited plane. Mr. Straka common destination Saturday: Mr. Trump’s campaign rally Tulsa, Okla.

Is confusing boes claps glad dumbass getting kicked flight glad get lives delaying entire flight. think first started Surgeon General Fauci said 40% people going get next two years. flattening curve thing spread out. course considered vaccine might year, numbers probably lower. bad symptoms? long? Damage lungs serious COVID infection: risk lower general population (and quite possibly zero), still breathing problem might cause problems wearing mask. Fair every point. understand large gatherings gone bit makes sad love do, overcome!!!

Thanks, many see L word immediately scream evil things. social programs even UBI done right. 

The percentages level, look Arizona. Two weeks earlier higher r0, it’s currently dropping. takes time. dingleberry Ehhhhhh.....

Our lockdown *ok*. fucked LTC homes (Especially Ontario Quebec) jumbled closures/openings (especially Ontario Quebec.

Alberta actually really well population. British Columbia well. rest Canada amazing.

We're 37th Country world population *17th* Coronavirus cases, **12th** deaths.

I'd give pandemic lockdown solid 5.5/10. “You’re panic attack, sitting 12 elk.”

Bill Burr gem. literally way could possibly get cases zero. 

There lot leeway cases absolute zero constant rising outbreaks like US Brazil. Countries like Germany, Singapore, South Korea, Australia, others gotten cases manageable levels allowing citizens relatively normal lives. VIRUS MANAGED. Yeah flew AA couple weeks ago although announced masks mandatory, several passengers weren’t wearing them. Even flight attendants removed periodically seated. one flight attendant kept lowering whenever talked people get drink orders, exactly you’d want wearing mask properly. Live TN confirm concerned. second wages go high enough makes business less profitable, positions automated. case industries, especially low skill industries. sucks, that's reality. People like make absolutely sick.

Do think care LIKE wearing mask? like it? people. Shock horror comfort, safety everyone else around well yourself.

The fact many people wandering around polite society us think mild discomfort trumps people's safety baffling.

I always said ""you look first"" apply comes pandemic following base rule containment. People think manner either, coin basic phrase, shit stirring idiots stupid understand basic fact can't behave like decent person want drama queen wearing material face right around us try mitigate virus.

TL;DR- fuck people stupid and/or selfish wear god damn mask. Vinegar kills coronavirus? hung unfortunately :/ Nah, owning sub right 100%. 3250 arizona. Six bucks right nut says Arizona, Texas Florida reporting tens thousands new cases day July. Here's updated chart new AZ COVID cases last 3 months (with today's data): 

- **Cases:** 2nd day row, we've hit new highs every case chart again. Today highest number positive cases added single day, 1st day 3K. 46K+ cases state. 7-day Deaths average also spiked. 
- **Testing:** PCR testing thousand tests today, still one higher numbers posted.
- **Spread:** Overall PCR positive test percentage absolutely skyrocketed 9.1% 9.5% (based 392K tests, 6.6% low) average week skyrocketed 15% 18% (based 20K cases). 
- **Hospital Utilization:** COVID Hospitalizations 10%, massive spike (another time high). ICU beds COVID patients dropped 4%. (Overall ICU usage flat.) Ventilators use COVID hit new time high. Intubations COVID patients went 25%. 

*Data Source: ""Conservative"" ""activist"" two words feel wrong right next understand data dropping rapidly filling up

Also wrong

Deaths trending steadily downward states media trying fear monger. Sorry easily manipulated. Honestly like Americans countries rn. whole downvote thing take serious he's literally scapegoating poor Latino migrant workers. crisis initially introduced affluent tourists. 

Am missing something here? seems like cruel inaccurate scapegoating. Reddit terrible morals. funny people convinced women lie various medical conditions get abortions. projection. So, facts sources? invalidating claim Schwarzenegger damage governor? Decided take easy way, think one, stick ""eDuCaTe yOuRsElF"" tactic can't back claims try shift burden proof onto someone else?

Just making sure page here. Apparently peacefully protesting makes ""rioter,"" actively trying hurt kill everyone around makes ""activist.""  didn’t even notice! love T-Shirt. say you’re thing didn’t make so. Actions speak. support racists, you’re racist. support homophobes, you’re homophobe. yes gay homophobic. support bigots, you’re bigot. See response u/chickenshitloser Arizona wants headline CA sun though ruins people's skin. Often assisted living nursing home care combined facility. Also, skilled nursing always go die; frequently combined rehab (which also serves older population, about-to-die population). Deaths might bad treatment become bit better since beginning. defiantly more, maybe extent might think. hospitals become overwhelmed, fear might start make decisions suck. miss reddit diarrhea'd people protesting lockdowns hanging pool memorial day fully endorsed 10's thousands gathering BLM protests/riots? obviously lot ""preventative measures"" applied depending like people doing, they're objectively something could spread virus. You’ve already owned even reading article yet bloviating two months immunity. It’s probably best sit out. Yeah, heard Pheumonia deaths like three times normal average states like Flordia year. First all...wtf 72? look young??

I think ever stopped exercising, he's built like bull access best medical care money buy COVID, even severe COVID, fever. It’s sensitive screening test all. Minnesota still downward trend even massive protests. Masks masks on. Studies have, however, shown tight, positive correlation better education reduction unrepentant asshole-itis flare-ups cases symptoms present political statements. Pray Arizona I'm suspecting attacks epithelial cells lining blood vessels bronchi, either directly and/or indirectly via inflammation. would explain wide ranging symptoms they've seen wide range reactions it. Glad sell stocks yesterday That's shocker. I've never fun time corporate landlord. made hell actually poor losing money. stock market still lifetime opportunity even average ""robin hood"" investors taking advantage.   rich come better ever. However unemployment benefits soon. aren’t dealing average 80 year old, talking people nursing homes, median remaining life expectancy 5 months. due testing right? We're 0.65% Ontario, dropping restrictions testing awhile back. reminded Fatality rates concern virus, especially country ties medical insurance employment, grossly overexpensive medical system begin with. mention basically non existent social safety net. 

There millions people age range virus kills, unconcerning number people lower range health complications long time, lifetime ""recover"". 

I'm one them, well age range concerned death. 

People morons take precautions. People morons angry federal government zero response. Almost nobody wore mask either Arizona Florida airports past weeks  even real? holy shit one done even entire plan.

You can't make large segment population live bubble everyone else continues normally. impossible even short term. news several days running... Yeah, detected cases, probally bunch silent undetected spreaders allready around. summer, Arizona adding 2500 new cases day fall winter terrifying. I'm hoping younger generations, maybe people going pandemic risk economy, see light realize system care them. need younger leadership take though, we're starting see local politics Congress. Holy shit! Positivity rate Arizona tests reported today 26% take turns, I'm getting paid 6 figures nothing probably see around 400 deaths day end month/early July.

Just time July 4th Super-Spreader Event! Sweden tried that, shutdown. economy still crashed equal extent neighbors, bought absolutely nothing extremely high death rate. 70-80% population still staying inside, know risky. can't keep businesses open revenue 20-30% risk takers, drinking bars eating restaurants, getting sick. sure tons people left save lives.

... spread virus. 5000 deaths vs 500? think guilt handle... apologists.. late remedy  think spray painting might good analogy. 

Imagine spray painting basement-- paint gets everything nearby, fumes linger days, sometimes strong enough give headache, even windows open. 

Compare spray painting outdoors-- can't even smell anymore soon take finger nozzle. Isn’t true illnesses? stressed makes healing difficult? Sorry missed point. correct wrong 

South Korea great lockdown China. locked wuhann pretty quick. Dragged people homes, shot hundred disobeyed. Great lockdown. interesting question. think law requires document condition American Airlines.

The Trumpsters advising people abuse law LIE non-existent medical condition. seem valid strategy.

1. airline call bluff believe gotten away it.
2. airline calls bluff option sue them, swear court disability committing perjury could subject penalty.
3. law require document condition American Airlines document condition American Airlines make exception think warranted.
4. American Airline kicks person legitimate need wear masks flight, American Airlines probably OK law requires reasonable accommodation - every accommodation. best example think Bill alcoholic job driving heavy machinery. Unpaid time treatment reasonable accommodation. Permission drive drunk unreasonable accommodation. Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, honestly exhausting, wonder everything damned hard days. Give gays corona virus probably already never going win MIL. enamored propaganda outlet. bother engaging. make arguments butterfly effect everything.  I'm seatbelt helmet laws based healthcare costs alone (which also effects everyone). speak dallas, looks like hospitals know they're going get crushed trying get necessary electives surge. events=250 up. events 5k up. Well used be. 
 
Yeah, that's fair. guess think even medium small gatherings happening. live area far fewer cases see two friends married other. That's it. Even then, wait two weeks seeing one another. 
  don’t think government should. {political party shall. named} ...I know devil don’t thing government everything

I'm going castigate that- think reasonable difference opinion here- arguing needs _permanent_ thing, although supportive policy. enacting something duration pandemic something (IMO) people political stripes able come together on. 
 test 10k per day would expect least hundred positives. normal point. new number 50% positive that’s alarming. 
 
The problem percent positive going well, I'm concerned. Yes, Universal open. They're taking safety precautions like requiring masks stuff, know realistic based patron behavior. signs basically saying can't protect Covid-19. COVID-19 inherent risk public location people present; cannot guarantee exposed visit. Review Important Safety 12 13 percent people 80 die per year normal state things. Oh yeah forgot im temporarily embarassed billionaire trust trickle something something bootstraps No, ton procedures lifesaving still done. 

Right now, rules place, hospitals following arbitrary contrary guidelines. 

Basically big three hospital companies whatever putting nice face it.

We've incredibly lucky luck seems running out. two-third US deaths per capita call success... People who've recovered, medicines take? multivitamins antibiotics? good idea get started multivitamins dosage CoVID patients? game girl regular clothes it.""  SJW!!!!""

This happens, evidenced new Mortal Kombat, think time people trying make girls skimpy clothing political issue. kind characters often get lot comments twitter. Often unrealistic body standards.

Personally, like character needlessly sexualized, think big deal. Spas. 

Amusement Parks. 

Gyms. 

Music venues (for performers). 

Sports venues (for athletes).

Various activities salons.

The patient occasionally coughs kisses hugs humans. descendants mine also managed infect humans well we're successful infecting humans right? Time passes, us lost host's immune system us survived inside host's cells.

Then, random mutation spike protein happened spike started reliably binding human ACE2. exact moment started all. infect cells ease. Please note already know replicate mammalian cells, learned bats. Now, reliably infect kill human cells. Given SARS virus, propagate via cough. host coughs new, mutated form starts spreading humans. Spreading humans means encounters different immune systems. virile, not. evolutionary challenge virus eventually, virus overcomes (via rapid mutation RNA viruses mutate fast).

Then descendants subtly roam human population. lines die lines adapt overcome. humans show symptoms one knows there's new virus playground check pneumonia common cold.

Then suspicions arise China many people started showing symptoms people took samples infected ran genetic experiments. then, confirmed. new virus playground. could happened December 2019. know rest story.

Yeah man, indifferent charged made crime police. convinced guilt falsified reports.to make stronger case. scary Social Workers, seems new goto. I’m sure increase pneumonia deaths, people wondering why, may assumed bad flu season. I'm bit disappointed that's stand out, really minimum expected tbh. Many retail outlets similar here, believe mandate, despite none active cases (Western Aus).

To get pub still need scan QR code, give contact tracing details, tick box declaring symptoms, they'll seat decent distance everyone else, disinfecting surfaces leave. Retail stores limited capacity, several temperature checks, sanitiser stations entry, lines outside etc.

We two active cases. 🤷‍♂️ know I'll ever need it, that's \*incredibly\* handy information know. Thank you!  barely testing back then. Short simple explanation arrive alone whatever reason. get test back unless extremely sick. they'll test anyone walks hospital. Completely different environment surrounding testing. one's emotional except people refuse worldview challenged. sub full fragile Reddit users around. Look testing increase. Texas ranks 45th 50 states tests per million residents. testing anything I'm willing bet trump would give lift AF One.  masks, like PITTA Japan, basically thin barely impede normal respiration still giving appearance wearing cloth mask (they meant allergies/pollen, containing cough although work degree). condition would opt wearing one hassled also worry around still keeping distance covering face elbow needed cough. Right, unless Cushing's Addison's - helpful advice treatment ""dude, stop stressing out. Try relaxed, like me, $250k/yr salary."" said, hospitalization wise state completely control.

From Newsweek yesterday:

Multiple Florida Hospitals Run ICU Beds Coronavirus Cases didn’t think misleading all. course they’re requiring everyone wear masks. Thanks! kill bunch elderly nursing homes.  twofer you. wait. takes weeks deaths start rolling in. Try see doctor asap. want scare could sign serious neurological issues, including stroke (known Covid risk). Hey, happy then. communities isolated enough independant. America few. live Idaho, small rural town. even virus average spreading. Locally 35% cases among Latinos, another 40% solely among retirement homes. basicly means 25% covid 19 positive walking among everyone else daily. Tourism summer huge here, little town gets share. Evel Kinevil jump site, one locations base jumpers dive 500' bridge. Also waterfall site. 3 things brings people around world possibly spread things like viruses. Oh yeah, community college actively brings hundreds international refugees yearly, sources. Point even small communities like mine get exposed enough make pandemic real threat everyone here. hope stays recession, hell, hope every place earth gets too. would worst place stuck wonder? Somewhere one airline serves middle nowhere. Mr. Straka said interview Thursday night medical condition reason didn’t wear mask. would elaborate condition said airline employee inquired telling get plane. disputed gave conflicting answers medical condition.

No, doesnt, he's lying shitbag like false god Trump I'll believe see it. know state political another shutdown. said.. ***should*** much looking implementing particular states COMPLETELY control. really stupid people becoming? sounds like doing, me! Interfering flight crew 20 year felony come $250,000 fine. announcement reminder may help people understand. also make clear receive lifetime ban airline police arresting gate don’t follow flight attendants instructions regarding masks. follow through. take people arrested put jail word travel fast. Yeah, agree. I'm trying defend using argument specific case. like people completely disregard like would never make sense all. Knowing apply makes lot easier argue people try use defend poor response government virus. backdated case community transmission France late December, consistent that. 

I think China obviously first outbreak, necessarily origin. may never know truth that. Lots people bad stunts attention. listening podcast NeoNazis game plan attacked news reports show victims. think mask thing extension everything listed though

ppl deal bullshit months see soon want riot left-wing causes virus vanishes... mask last straw

ppl losing lives, businesses.... everything

and political stunt establishment? ppl get pissed Person except natural born Citizen, Citizen United States, time Adoption Constitution, shall eligible Office President; neither shall person eligible Office shall attained Age thirty five Years, fourteen Years Resident within United States.

Nobody likes re-breathe hot air bro, quit thinking exception rule. like American Airlines favourite way fly now. Alberta think mostly nursing homes meat packing plants Calgary. Edmonton pretty mild, worried second wave. *not* want go second lockdown, unless things get really nasty, far herd immunity even people susceptible first place. sad young people getting it. highest rates infections age groups 20 49 now. severity case genetically linked. Even pre-existing conditions genetic factors blood type play role sick get.  There's lot athletic young people experiencing long term complications ""mild"" cases. time let go idea somehow young, healthy athletic makes bullet proof. Know blood type first decide invincible! Specific materials trigger that, like allergy.  problem able filter makes sense non sense. Today, much information floating around people consume ridiculous rates get confused. common sense camp, drop social media seek information reliable sources. sit let information fed you. Yesterday went graduation Texas variety age groups, probably 1000 people. outdoors damn 0 face masks (except faculty) way social distancing taking place. went grocery shortly could count one hand amount masks saw.

Trump stage dive right crowd show us tough /s Really need nurses union step threaten walk city doesn’t provide basic precautions citizens ample PPE healthcare workers.

It worked Hong Kong.

All reopening schemes balance hospital capacity, neglect fact hospitals still proper PPE cities making many cases systems safely handle. Even without willful ignorance, people still bound support things. may go little hungry instead going little vegan. US govermemt/ media pushing dont buy masks, straight said save HCWs, US lied said masks dont work.

Countries listened told people use cloth masks, saw shortage went full lockdown. countries good now. 

The US decision lie really got us point, true display classy are, US went blame recommending masks Nowhere tell going provide definition irony. completely missed point.

What wearing mask plane would make guy alt-right hero? giant asshole = conservative activist, got  understand. realize points made entirely irrefutable, especially one ideologically dispossessed able interpret reality is. bet posts actually purely political allow long supportive viewpoints purely political? Seems like never would read felt urge respond true original post responded purely political response far direct, accurate personal. Get bent proof Arizona Florida people terrible hygiene. concerns masks made permanent? I'm extremely concerned be, that's motivation behind embracing masks.

There various media articles already floating idea permanent masking (comparing wearing pants, etc). hard time seeing ever could go away. something like place long enough, never goes away.

This compounded way mainstream narrative protective measures rapidly shifted temporarily flatten curve (ie overwhelm hospitals) March today's ""no normal without vaccine."" get people think vaccine coming, even come years now, damage kids growing masked totally losing nonverbal communication would already done.

There's reason think ever eradicate virus; far likely new respiratory virus always around much like colds flus. mean masks forever? I'm look here, Professors Medicine indicating virus making way population simply going go: masks would dystopian nightmare, we'd lose much human communication. longer universal mask wearing goes on, likely becomes.

Wouldn't make much sense give at-risk people P100s (which unlike cloth masks actually protect wearer), mandatory masking mass transit, allow faces show otherwise? Heard family member school facing one ‘outbreaks’ - real story

A child’s mother entered hospital heavily pregnant order give birth, exhibiting symptoms all. days stay tested found positive COVID. Still symptoms. Hasn’t contact child week. School high alert probably classed ‘outbreak’. I’m sorry loss. concerned American. possible covid, could normal flu.

I got regular flu 4 years ago. felt like got hit bus. literally spent 4 days couch watching whatever TV remote far away.

I think people say ""it's flu, bro"" actually real flu. brutal. I'm pretty healthy, get flu shot, can't imagine 70 getting this. I'd probably die. Properly trained educated officers, community. trained deescalation, hand hand combat. spend majority time working within community jobs, available needed. example 2 days week chef, 2 days week officer, 1 day training. officer high-stress job, can't 40 hours week, every week years mental problems it. saying protests blame spike. 

Source? many idiots thinking government basically saying is..... Let guess... new ‘broader’ investigation conducted Bill Barr?
Remember boys girls ... it’s lie really believe it. Sure.

But absolutely affect amplitude wave.  not. Stop doomers. Nashville fine cases hospitalizations, that's taking account restaurants packed. long states stay afloat? Travel within US picking back up. Yeah mean it’s fun games Corona isn’t scary anymore, hospitals start getting overwhelmed people can’t get normal problems etc.

When you’re 3000+ new cases day, surely hospitals start feeling Oh, intentionally obtuse. see. Good luck life man, need overwhelmingly kills individuals age 65.

It overwhelmingly kill individuals age 65. people kill, age 65. There's important distinction there. Film critics actually go theatre see films? thought would recieve advanced viewing home. go I'm advocating opposite. I'm hoping protesters stay home, least stay far away BOK Center rally held. 
 Mango really, *really* seems want violence rally. I'm hoping protest organizers fall transparent trap.  First off, 600 heat stroke deaths US year. 120,000 Covid deaths US first half year. 

So maybe you’re comparing probability random deaths lifetime 70+ years probability virus 4 months. 

Second, virus‘ odds get worse virus isn’t done killing. 

1 7,000 Floridians ALREADY died. people die ratio get worse. deaths double end year (or know, August) 1 3,500 Floridians dead. 

This assuming static population otherwise, new births offset “normal” deaths. passenger safety.  getting staff need commit sail. Heck bet also difficulty sourcing food entertainment etc. shown big impact didn’t spread CoVID19.

Sarscov2 spread on/off, it’s spectrum, mass gatherings area reason moves dial towards spread.

Maybe much outdoors lots masks, it’s still moving dial.

And CoVID19 disproportionately kills black people, good look white allies anything promotes chain transmission. article says, traveling New York attend event location time. everything conspiracy. Perhaps examine irrational biases accusing others gullibility. go baby. signed for! fucking closed minded you, ""i hate someone different opinion"" It’s actually pretty helpful two similar countries used opposing strategies compared later. That’s great hear Delta, return flight assuming gonna better getting confirmation nice. samui still amazing better! go get tested COVID-19? Sunday started getting fever, sore throat, exhausted. Symptoms lasted Wednesday. Thursday woke insane sore throat. Today, almost symptoms. go get tested, assume Corona city hit hard last two weeks. 

My question is, gotten tested? philosophy sick, testing going confirm it. cure, tell stay home treat like flu. treated like flu left home feel normal, stay quarantined. Oh that’s interesting! Thank you...that’ll save effort frustration! thinking leaving house kills average 5 grandmas. isnt novel virus....its narrative virus... Ouch. That's gotta real thing?! know, felt cathartic say it. Next conspiracy theory: ploy elite get citizens traveling back forth ""safe zones"" tourism. exactly done world pandemic? took ages declare pandemic, covered China, adviced travel bans, lied masks, gave contradictory statements almost everything. 

China honest useful pandemic ffs. find hard believe given seems quite rapid growth virus appears ‘clusters’ necessitate targeted lockdowns. possible due way it’s reported news? virus maybe easy control seemed since weren’t trying spread widely already lot momentum creating epidemics?

Don't pretend like understand science. regard there's people born xxy xyy chromosomes. tell climate denial, vaccine denial, virus denial, mask use denial. get they're helpful.

But shows, bunch places Europe crushed curve without masks.

I know American obsession. Also feds real plan place track control spread. wearing masks becomes political wedge issue. We've basically done everything wrong imagineable. NYC also socially distanced protest. almost everyone knows someone affected. Dead alive wrong way look it. die Covid not. questions good quality life there. median stay nursing home death 5 months. survival rate Covid even elderly quite high. Some, maybe 50 percent would lose months life average, would live better quality life time left, would get say goodbye loved ones. can’t imagine many would making informed choice dying alone lower quality care risk losing months life. don’t see anyone asking opinions. Rather, think lack empathy. People might know people gotten sick, least sick, feel like choice really hurt people anyway. can't empathise people get seriously ill die.

It's shameful, selfish thing person do. hope people see reason become part solution many die suffer lasting illness. Ok. go out.

All saying is, fine home till shit gets sorted out. Frankly, dont believe half shit say, annoyed fact check-fact checks.

He also recommends population stay home avoid visiting relatives interior country. ""The fact phase 2 de-escalation mean COVID-19 disappeared Dominican Republic; trying keep situation control,"" ministerial statement adds.

**Coronavirus, hurricane season lack testing**

The start hurricane season also cause alarm, since, according PAHO, could aggravate effects pandemic make testing treatment difficult. enough, also shortage coronavirus testing, lack could affecting figures, suspected much higher official ones.

""There two laboratories whole country carry coronavirus testing, capital, Port-au-Prince,"" explains Sandra Lamarque. ""Samples places take time arrive, bottleneck capacities exceeded,"" adds. Also, enough medical teams take samples population, also shortage swabs, says.

""The number infections deaths vastly underestimated,"" says. ""There cases registered suspicious coronavirus, sometimes results tests take week done. hand, number cases underestimated died COVID-19 recorded confirmed cases, large number suspected cases die, many times relatives want wait three days team collects samples bodies. take dead person away,"" says. cases never go record. words, problems occurring levels: lack medical personnel, lack supplies, lack laboratories, this, added fragility health infrastructure, makes situation critical, given current rise infection curve.

**One hope: increased testing capacity Haiti**

However, initiative decentralize coronavirus testing recently launched, head MSF's mission Haiti tells DW: hospital center another north country expanding testing capacity next days four entities able carry VID-19 tests. ""Even solve bottlenecks, least things improve two departments Haiti,"" says.

But another aspect, perhaps serious, concerns MSF: social stigmatization COVID-19 patients. media outlets recently reported cases lynching violent incidents. ""This biggest problem,"" says Lamarque. ""I witnessed several cases violence related COVID-19. facilities intentionally set fire also acts vandalism people opposed construction health centers neighborhoods. think centers bring sick people neighborhoods, opposed that,"" describes. ""We forget Haiti suffering deep political socio-economic crisis since 2018,"" says. complex problem since population ""an enormous distrust institutions. ""This new,"" says, ""the thing happened 2010 cholera epidemic.

MSF facilities six different locations Haiti, ""we never incidents problems community,"" explains Sandra Lamarque. ""We rely collaboration community religious leaders, traditional healers rural areas, take visit facilities. also train spread information coronavirus community, create short videos show people. go trucks take message people, door door, must protect loved ones,"" says.

The doctor says MSF health professionals find creative solutions pandemic enlighten population break beliefs one go hospital get COVID-19, taken guinea pigs test coronavirus vaccine. ""It's urgent inform people, put end rumors, dangerous,"" concludes.

Today also South Carolina's first ever day 1k+ new cases one day.

California North Carolina yet reported likely going push us 30k first time since May 1st. Yeah, long wears masks safer, short period time, that's great. can't wear mask, putting much higher risk anemia, probably good work. That's original question conditions can't wear mask + considered high risk. 

A deviate septum injury rather illness doubt makes higher risk, can't put something bridge nose, that's legit wear masks protect others, including people can't wear masks. Like get vaccines part protect people can't get vaccines. 

Congrats baby! Good work ethic important, pregnant lady iron deficiency use time excuse relax little :) Yay stimulus would much easier make statewide mandate rather city decide themselves. seems like cities Maricopa county right thing, mine. guess expect anti-mask crowd flock city, awesome. 
We've staying home since middle March, going ""stimulating economy"" time soon fuck that. Ducey completely spineless, Trump rally Phoenix next week happening. I'm hoping Ducey might find try get situation control, I'll surprised anything significant. I'm concerned hospitals healthcare workers, even another shutdown started today, we'd still bunch people getting sick next weeks. going terrible.
Oh obviously looking good schools reopen August, even Ducey says fine happen. think strap-on boot trickling. I'm introvert lockdown actually calming peaceful me. mind went rest year. moron! Maybe president one day! say us properly protect children? I'm sad thought it. eat lot paint chips kid? Maybe? certainly argument made case. getting 5 year average numbers I'm seeing link? POTUS? act like first person, ffs falling level? Actually read comment make ass yourself. everyone get you, agreeing wondering people feel like that. conversation you, would understood read attack mode. New Yorker, tell headed unmitigated disaster. states opening full steam ahead without precautions. People need take seriously adopt everyday life. New York. EVERYONE wearing mask avoiding close contact, indoor crowds. subway lifeblood city, ridership still 90%. Every Uber plastic screen protecting driver. Every grocery store line outside social distancing limiting number people inside. Texas never turn NYC one Europe wanted go initial days virus spreading, ever. international airport flooded Europeans whole state would wiped now. pride. Odds are, wearing one over. Yes soon test subject walls outside results longer matter. negative Monday morning positive Tuesday constantly testing everyone multiple times it’s practical. 

Logically test everyone don’t enough test material labs equipped handle amount samples. idea could test 330 million foolish best would need test test awhile. gives businesses room ban people without masks face much pushback. Still doubt win race vs US? fighter. hope pulls through.  positive many people going affected coronavirus many people going lose loved ones, nobody revote thoughtless assholes back office!  first time asks says “I do” Chinese guy speaks lady asks sounds like says “no, don’t.” hate gay ppl 29K cases today counting do. really see deaths going spike even lowering fatality rate. Oh yeah I’m totally agreement - it’s scary looking headline seems lot aimed making parents scared sending kids back. 

It’s fucking shitstorm schools - every teacher know desperate get many kids back, yet unions fiercely campaigning keep closed.. know lot teachers really angry unions way they’ve acted. Get life dude. bullshit doesnt even make sense. Honestly fuck site. I’m upvoting I’m also curious Kid Rock’s examples assholeness. Yes, meant. Thanks! Proof? use word? I’m presenting evidence mainstream acknowledges masks inadequate cannot relied protection. 

“What clear, however, universal masking alone panacea. mask protect providers caring patient active Covid-19 it’s accompanied meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, gown. mask alone prevent health care workers early Covid-19 contaminating hands spreading virus patients colleagues.

This one source. many others. 

Dr. Anthony Fauci:
 “People walking around wearing masks. Masks provide protection people think do.” I'm curious think california. numbers going up, positivity remaining around 4%, looks like numbers going testing. great, seem quite dire appropriate lump fl, tx az. clear, banned conservative, mask thing reason paper. Perfectly said. fellow Americans worry much ""precious freedoms"" instead good all, make sick. really like pouty selfish children. Yea mean don’t think job let wear N95s lol.  sure law, believe reasonable people reach reasonable outcomes.

Did man legally present signed letter doctor? Maybe/maybe did. airline let fly unmasked? Maybe/maybe did. problem. one flight attendant kept lowering whenever talked people get drink orders, exactly you’d want wearing mask properly.

People still understand point masks. clear leadership inform country... stupid white house press secretary Good him. people refuse wear masks! America headed beyond coming weeks. fly last week. flight Delta great. boarded back first, enforced masks, wipes available got seat. max 2 people row left back row completely open. pilot came takeoff explained filtering system importance keeping mask on. 


Alternatively flight back American nightmare. Boarding free everyone climbing plane. let people board masks chin. Every single seat sold out. flight attendants confused people boarded sit back row last minute apparently back row supposed kept open, AA decided sell it. One person last minute back row sweating coughing throughout flight. Many people flight abandoned masks takeoff walking bathroom without them. avoid AA future. thing places already closed due linked virus. gain one number list 400+. symptoms also minor compared people know it. also can't donate blood U.S. think would able supply antibodies anyway. knowledgeable antibody transfusion positive works. couldn’t imagine way. must longest 2 weeks ever one passed last. level illogical nonsense come elected officials? ready reports talked people statistics living. also emote everytime someone disagrees me.

I'm trying fight university freshmen sensibilities. I'm paying mortgage seeing disconnect worries outcomes covid.

Don't start emoting beacuse I'm telling thing read blog trying sell toys scaring you. can’t get never leave house!!! Take corona!!

In seriousness, saw something another thread based population significantly way worse Italy even peak. know bad got. Every reply I’ve seen thread nonsensical thing ever US represents 1/3 active cases **the entire world** idk getting at. Twice many new cases yesterday 10,000 US peak day...this really terrible stuff here. kind obvious already much cases United States. done 2.2 million tests those, 1,000,000 infected. U.S done 22 million cases those, 2 million infected. I'm seeing fall back ""It's cuz increased testing."" better september 2022 can't always push it. random. That's thing. plus, order push would need coping rituals would include taking mask focus breathing else way get it. I'll thrash panic goes away takes forever I'd look like actual lunatic public.

I somatic anxiety particularly bad scenario. lose control functions barely grip begin with. always triggered anything either. That's big issue it. get it, stop everything anything power struggle it. usually goes away within hours, comes back. don’t think Iarguewithretards. won’t argue why. r/newsihate

Holy shit sub actually exist? don’t know you’re downvoted. Cases trending upward past weeks would incredibly surprised cases continued decline today. yeah, projection I’ve seen deaths even close zero August. actually mad see post history.

You want discussion.

You want right.

Ta ta Trumper Completely agree, definitely  protest therefore raise overall infection rate want. I’m saying can’t. I’m saying it’s going kill people. Revolutions don’t need bloodless. 

Do know whether genetic component black people dying COVID often? almost always is. 

I don’t really want hear next couple months, unless good way counting deaths caused many black Americans attending MASSIVE rallies bringing home families - separate increased rate due systemic racism medicine.

Like it’s going annoying hear coming spike entirely due shops reopening NOTHING tens thousands people mingling shoulder shoulder every major American city driving back every suburb. agree opening shops dumb, can’t pretend protests won’t contribute deaths. would different vs other? like first time people spend time AC, different? Greed care people dying. That's amounts to. poor water fire fun watch blaze burn. lied. could’ve said reserving masks right essential workers showing symptoms... Let’s real, aren’t bunch idiots. know transmissible person person yet said wasn’t China said so. also said can’t consider pandemic everywhere spreading alarming rate. also said came bats....... Snapchat, computer, etc. plenty ways talk “face-to-face” virtually. new world live need accept it. Surgical masks cloth face coverings significantly restrict oxygen flow. Oxygen CO2 molecules plenty small enough pass materials. weren’t enough, masks aren’t airtight, plenty air flow sides.

I’d love hear medical conditions people think prevent wearing mask. thing exists, people probably shouldn’t public, let alone confined space people nothing protecting them. people would much greater risk dying COVID wearing mask. doubt there's going outbreaks schools pretty much everywhere countries re-open, need look things context - headline says ""1 4 Covid-19 outbreaks linked schools"" pure clickbait. meant incite panic. 

But, actually read article - 199 respiratoy outbreaks entire UK - mean Covid-19.. could something else. Even worst case scenario - 24 outbreaks among school population 11.7 million schoolkids pretty low. people chronically stupid. INTELLIGENT DISCOURSE?????

LOLOLOLOLOLOL Thanks suggestion. $45, though... Jeez.

The face shields got $5 each. Well 50k new cases Brazil fall going winter They’re naive. They’re willfully ignorant need students’ tuition fees would take years, course assumes able keep making antibodies years infected.

The best gameplan social distancing, everyone wears mask, quarantines little transmission, aggressive testing opening up. actually go days semi normal quelling outbreaks pop up. mean time work treatments vaccines. Sadly pipe dream. much misinformation political posturing. Uh, know. British actor. Bandersnatch Cummerbund. comes cans? wonder sign waver, rest staff, probably told wear masks. No, isn't. insurance fully covers hospital stay, pay ZERO pocket.

If pay 8K deductible something similar, never comprehensive health insurance separate 'emergency' insurance plan cover 8K deductible like do.

It's 10 bucks month. Desantis trump's pocket another public servant around? I'd like know measures implemented work due current pandemic. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

Pretty much treating like 2019 living happens. Kind hilarious. quite right. Excess mortality data ISTAT available months picture paints number 50k 60k deaths. Saying ""more 40k"" conservative and, stage, completely correct. Arnold always speaking truth Two things track positivity rates hospitalizations, little data points matter trying really see things going testing country horrific long early on.

Also, birth control 100% effective. Even married couples use protection end pregnant sometimes. 

Yes, pro-choice. believe abortion used birth control. 'pro-abortion' however recognize circumstances can't control. believe username ""beefhead"" male need get trying control reproductive rights. Also, read comment history. clearly make feel better talking flexing others. 

Example- woman remission cancer. Found returned. Aggressively. needed start treatment would die next months. Goes start treatment finds pregnant. treat long pregnant. Married, happy, even wanted start family. choices:

1) receive treatment hope lives 9 months birth baby. Leaves behind husband child. 

2) receive treatment, die cancer, baby dies underdeveloped.

3) Abort baby, receive treatment, live. Maybe try another baby adoption remission again.

What would done?

This weird disease evolved bats, weird immune systems.

It's gonna weird while. Yeah it’s “wait two weeks” almost 2 months now. Cases becoming prominent younger population, large part population virus isn’t fatal for. ask too. Shopping nightmare. study guess you’re referring (which nothing Arizona’s numbers Lombardy’s I’m sure you’re bringing assume that’s haven’t yet linked it: know it’s topic) widely regarded extremely weak methodology, coming completely incorrect conclusions puts people risk spreads misinformation.

I agree articles read portrayed way. read them, thinking free partisan stance propaganda.

It funny though, final 0.2-0.3% IFR Covid looks lot closer Ionnidas's estimates people saying 2 months managed lose decades worth respect months. people think opinion worth anything basically Fox News. 

This opinion based data whatsoever. 

Hah. Sweden: already culled herd preparation that... know can't total lock forever mean live denial. middle ground acknowledge spread happening address it, like adults. Hospitalizations percentage tests coming back positive rising, due testing alone. asking change life wearing mask protect friends. really much risk, one going change life stay home.

Sorry I'm going live life way want way want live it. 

I dont care greater good, care friends family I. That's problem recommending masks. problem attach monopoly initiation force (the state) law says wear one. fine even throw random person jail wearing mask. Seems like nice modern western way handle issue. put everyone comply jail. Yay! Anyone thinks isn’t complete waste time without mass testing everyone absolute moron. [Norwegian health chief: need close Karen made way Indonesia, probably coughing whole way there. Hospitalization percent positive increasing.

At point denial. really understand recovery immunity you? thing basically happens pneumonia cases too...does happen rate? Idk  Lol. number matters gdp

And Sweden much better based gdp  leave interact elderly risk factors? so, exercise extreme caution. live someone like that, go indoor places recreationally, personally.

But live alone young healthy people I'd still wear masks possible go restaurants bowling alleys whatever open, sure. cause Trump bad response pandemic, downplayed it, want bad economic situation.

/s Frothing mouth typing disagree. everybody matters public policy disagrees too. Thankfully. really, size 5-6 major european countries mask isn’t ugly ;) lies here. apparently doomsayers pointing memorial day. post isn’t really political either yet half comments related Trump way. It’s different. Hard precise - hence gave wide range avoid stay versus hospital stay different thing. think ICU stay probably bottleneck, hard sure. Here's random study says median (which much lower average here) 9 beds - even harder, facilities trained staff use - could certainly lower mortality upping hospitalization ICU rates. fixed line need stay catastrophe happens. act getting close full need ration beds going make mortality go up. act lot people hospital beds COVID going make people stay away hospitals, causing deaths.

If treatments could dramatically lower ICU visit duration (presumably would also improve outcomes), mitigation could successful.

Smart :/ Yes. Another site shows following

May 2019 30,567

May 2020 says low wages Yesterday someone sub tried tell people hospital faking. That's seriously dedicated fakery. reckon get covid blood switch tubes drawn? selfishness. lack morality compassion. common celebrated among wide segment US population. agree majorly. dunno, give kid meds something make *drowsy/unconcious* fight mask shots? ordering shots home, answers. :( body force follow subreddit need get one £80 quid, go through? funny everyone shitting Millennials avocado toast ""Millennials killing XYZ"" fine long time, ""Boomer"" turned insult everyone contracted case vapours.  says 2000 inmates tested positive. That's ""concern"" that's reality. They're sick. 

And Fox news CNN anything a.) Infected or, b.) solitary confinement?

They put confinement due 9 available beds. beds full, else put infected prisoners order quarantine them? put solitary confinement.

Then link bunch statistics dealing U.K. inmates prison United states. even read article? Omg :( 100% agree you. staffing shortages across country hospitals going forward. wife nurse. Plenty friends quit jobs hospitals ppe. nurses aren’t willing put life line, let alone ancillary staff like transport, housekeeping, food services, etc. 

Lots surgeons longer procedures hospitals. Instead moving practices surgicenters. patients refuse go hospital risk infection. surgical centers requiring patients get covid tested 48-72 hours prior procedure. 

And I’m sure pay near offered NYC. Travel nurses getting 5-7k/ week nyc. doubt Arizona Florida going pay anywhere near that. interesting definition flat.  Gov Abbot stupid. Even plans sending kids back school Fall, ZERO Covid restrictions testing (no masks, temperature checking). Meanwhile, Texas mayors urging change mind he’s standing firm this. believe 6 identified human coronaviruses: two sarbecoviruses named four viruses associated common cold. Disease-causing infection shown elicit antibody response lasting 6+ months, cases much longer. baggy eyes sore throat. thought allergies. mother tested positive (same symptoms cough) figured probably Covid got tested myself. Went away week sure flu? guy Facebook went high school said flu. mean, could flu, right? got people wear masks without turning insane excuse turn people political prisoners? No? big problem US long time dealing symptom it. Good. They'll *try* boycott Costco weeks run barrels mayonnaise 50 packs toilet paper.

The thing people they're equipped boycott. en masse anyway. They're working class, geographically isolated alternatives. wear mask stay home. They'll comply time.

PS, article may 1st. middle June. boycott. People bought masks. Costco stock gained plenty value since April.  arnt science JOB CREATORS lol 


(to them) definitely something ramping back February March. slightly longer term, already screwed account number nurses doctors going lose (temporarily permanently) COVID. Freedumb* eradicated became lethal shortly exposure. People can't go spreading disease they're dead. Since symptoms COVID-19 take weeks develop, gives plenty time spread host agile like contact others. Also many people sick extended period time buys virus much time spread. They’ll “enforce” like Florida did. Stop way in, ask you’re coming from, make sign document promise you’ll quarantine. That’s Fuck passenger. Noped out? help kinds stupid shit shared social media sort fact checking put place. People eat shit up. I've someone tell Wikipedia left biased trusted. Fucking Wikipedia. mean sure, possible potentially false information surface there. That's double-check listed sources.

However still leagues reputable one conspiracy video linked.  like mask, hate ventilator.

Me too. number ICU beds per capita different lot developed countries, European nations old populations. Many done fine. What's fucked Florida response pandemic. best way loose karma gonna happen coronavirus approves message. pay $450 month RTO 3 BR attached house huge yard, another $150 taxes sewer. (I RTO boss takes straight pay, agreed I’d pay extras) exchange person interjected relate either them. Maybe political hack try squeeze cheep shot (especially false one) unrelated convo. really depends employer managers dealing situation, think.

Overcommunicating way reduce assymetric information. Get people informed, repeat dozen times, levels anxiety probably reduced.

But relationships never forged trust get worse working home. reason still indoors make political statement. Plenty rallies held outside, especially June. one best months weather. think call someth- ah yeah, no, call “stupidity.” funniest thing bedwetters never challenge - downvote you, never challenge you. Definitely that. That's called stupidity. cannot live restrictions long though need put health first health others. Holding wedding almost 200 downright irresponsible right now. Coincidentally, country experiencing huge spike also moronic leader. 

President Bolsonaro Brazil, aka guy tried hide fact amazon intentionally set fire, denied virus's existence initially. believed covid crisis fabricated media big deal. 

[I wish making Fellow Marylander checks numbers daily. Even day looked like daily number climbed bit (maybe Tuesday), posititivity rate tests still decreased. numbers averaged several days less prone fluctuations, also illustrates much testing ramped up.

In addition others mentioned, think drive expand testing alongside preparation reopening definite good move.

In reality, army Karens might actually solution. I'd definitely say depends Europe... 25% Leicester's 2,494 confirmed Covid-19 cases reported last two weeks, according official figures.

Which means completed another round testing Secretary Matt Hancock said officials working hard track affected.

Which means Health Secretary Matt Hancock told officials 'have look see' could find City Council's public health director said numbers - 658 last fortnight - ""relatively small"" concern.

Which means Leicester City Council's public health director really concerned Browne said city high levels health conditions diabetes, ""pockets deprivation, significant Black, Asian Minority Ethnic population"".

Which means Ivan Browne knows ethnic minorities UK marginalised pushed well poverty relaxing lockdown rules, Mr Browne warned country still grip pandemic.

Which means despite government knowing safe re-open country, say Thursday evening, Asda said would temporarily close meat processing plant.  statement, said: ""As soon became aware colleagues Kober site may Covid-19, responded swiftly worked collaboratively local authority Public Health England test colleagues.  also voluntarily closed site protect colleagues prevent transmission.

Which means insurance company advised shut - way, cases went court later date, would able prove followed procedures therefor need self-isolate receive full pay aim reopen facility early next week.""

&amp;#x200B;

Which means also advised throw sweetener. view, essentially. cancer patient wears mask (even Covid) protect weakened immune system, must offer protection.

&amp;#x200B;

Asia misfortune deal outbreaks learn hard lessons contain quickly. So, dunno. Following example seemed smart.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, remember news stories back March saying discouraging mask usage shortage needed save first responders. Perhaps would truthful toilet paper panic buy. mean like scientist doing? Exactly! Fauci can't spewing blatant lies question people anti-science. That's good idea!!! Lol tired rhetoric sure live NYC? reopening plan NYC rest state. Phase 1 hit metrics next phase two weeks after. We’ve never separate rules. Cases basically flat testing going up. Why? correct, four coronaviruses common colds.

The information spread everywhere, world, people like - easily spooked outraged - would knee jerk way supplies needed people crucial roles. earth could be? Oh well, we'll never know, Source? could absolutely guarantee year. Like cases all. see heavy lockdowns, surprise..its back China Fellow 666. Enjoy bankruptcy AMC Good, deaths lagging indicator. Goodness gracious steadfast Since know Covid 19 started 2019, stands reason spread air travel initial days China realized it.

It help Chinese tried hush things silence scientists discovered first. That’s person quiet, shouting could drastically worse. choir practice one person got 52 60 people choir sick singing hours. Correct. Science method discovering knowledge. method presenting it. Pants? mean genital prisons? I'm son, racist turd. fun Trump rally. Pardon ignorance, union strike? possible Texas teachers communicate kind protest going work? mobilize enough people show work school districts do? Serious question, would fire everybody hope best? teachers teach? Yes death rate going several states. quality life like millions hospitalized? People think things like well. Safety bit factor comes spending. like know plane crashes. odds low. triple odds plane crashes see ticket sales decline increase Fauci said ""don't wear masks"" months. He's part problem. turn around complain anti-science pretty fucking rich part. Good. every right there. Fed given masks. would argue ideological approach. fit narrative. They're also unaware fact glaciers move... even end top mountain somehow glacier formed it, glacier would carried mountain tore splinters. 

but whatever, magic! mean, miracle! Yes. suppose depends stupid get months leading Thanksgiving think ""small"" amount rather ""fair"" amount. antibody studies right coming pretty low numbers think (too tired go article hunt moment, apologies), IIRC, single-digit percentages sample populations.

I think things going get bad fall, bad enough make spring look like walk park. Yes, certain percentage population will, theoretically, able go life like 2019. think summer restaurants closing two days opening half staff sick people going one night whole group getting sick, people might actually change behavior result. cool. might pervasive, there. Canada shockingly high rates climate change denial. Go crowd people outside maybe universities, education professionals gathered together, find anti vaxxer. educated escape either. find older people professional degrees jobs buying conspiracies like this. seems knowledge mean person capable rational critical thinking.

The decrease prosperity found traditional 1st world nations, plus internet means American issue anymore. little ahead race. Ask Brits. LOL next going tell climate change exist. Get fuck here. OC checking hospitalization rate higher LA county Riverside/Ventura county. I'm avoiding public places essential stores 2021. necessarily. There's healthy young people dying COVID-19 doctors left shrugging. always know otherwise healthy strong young people dying this.

Another possibility could comorbidity unaware of. Threats like public health overall health prosperity nation need removed office ASAP. Even then, tell ""We going wear mask try anything us, **we going fight back call police you**!"" We're still waiting ""magically go away."" Lol didn’t realize thought talking three different people?

Mobile. excuse :P think way year friend Isn’t hiv entirely different type vaccine isn’t counterpoint flu vaccine hundreds types vaccines available? Alright parents grandparents first. Let's sacrifice stock market gods. Yup. believe line is, “Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.” know else wore flair. Source? tired comment every post Indeed. experts didnt lie, source did

WTF talking about? source said wear masks. Experts said wear them. Who's liar?  *can* *are they*? many citations write? everyone blows off, going do? saved unborn. It’s simple. You’re fuck don’t wear mask. Starting next month, piss people’s feet wearing mask. don’t care go jail. Make movement. 

What would rather have. asshole pissing feet one trying destroy immune system.  Maryland. Also NM still averaging 100-200 per day movement within range likely noise say going 4000 6000 vs 100 150. well may be. personally think over, going short lived, takes 2 weeks sometimes, virus pop back "" recovered"" person.

To respond, ""they got huh?"" always say: hard wear mask. since March whenever go outside bothered one bit. enough car accidents might wait while. contaminated entire room allowed work 15 minutes told me. meant Charlotte. 3-4 weeks roads pretty much empty. People avoided everywhere except store. Social distancing pretty much norm. got complacent. Charlotte mostly spared. Even though ICU's filling, technically overwhelmed. give 4 weeks people back home, social distancing, wearing masks. won't, many many will.  That's probably pretty fair assessment. Arnold Schwarzenegger reduced murders sentence dad friend political ally. South Carolina came short first day 1000 new cases. Today reported 978 new cases, last Thursday reported 679 previous Thursday 355.

Its smaller state getting attention AZ/FL/TX/CA definitely scary growth rate. “Masks pussies.” that's what's happening, apologize. Ha ha ha ha ha. think real Quaid? is! NY *probably* ok long run contact tracing. places US? much. thing face mask hurt feelings apparently wear bike helmet he?  true. silly.

The US country stupid conservatives.

Mainstream conservative parties Europe made morons like R party is. People forget mask protect protect others. appreciate information. still within ICU average. Interesting. Obviously COVID overrun hospitals though. saw Italy. hope US healthcare system doesn’t fold. Right. fucked. hope one day meet shake hand sir,it would dream come true me. Yeah, 2020. score well government, can't travel, work, shop.... 

It hard hide 5 years ago, they've fixed bugs now. Bergamo particularly dense? chin mask worst. mask anything, also look dumb. It’s trashy look. doctors also say vaccines good so....
/s pretend go take shit 15 mins wait moron leaves. Way move goal posts. 18 year olds beach. original comment masks general, hence stupid. would wise go edit comment top say referring science wearing mask 18 year old beach, otherwise people gonna correctly think complete moron. gotta say good luck. Law enforcement county live one work (two Southern Oregon counties) publicly stated enforce Kate Brown's covid mandates. least here, nothing change. people care, care. people don't, still won't. Yes Also theaters already upgraded larger reclining seats. used 150-200 seats probably 80 now.  Constitutionality enforced quarantine hasnt challenged Hawaii, state? 

Until Court decides this, speculation. Freedom unlimited unconditional US everyone understands free point begin harm people physically. see reason spreading disease would protected. Man, that’s childhood favorite. Really shined light black market elf factories. Can’t wait *hack*-to-school season get already University Milwaukee going back person come fall guess June, East Asian countries low case loads compared US/Europe, Wuhan explode first would places Wuhan travelers, that's case.

All say right Wuhan superspreader event took seriously first. one work does. aided ejection three different people refused put masks back today alone. Sort of, problem measures context baseball we're likely going 7th inning 150 pitches spent entire 1st inning ignorantly trying convince catcher he's one throws ball. idiots listening Rogan proselytise moron saying ""you gonna wear mask bro?"" YouTube, guess Google cares. Feel addressed. Tbf wear masks specifically made stop spread bacteria/viruses/fluids. Cloth masks definitely great.

That said, mask mask. I’ve heard places random check ins place tell you’re staying issuing huge fine you’re home. need mainstream stories people getting caught scare many visitors obeying it. see that!!! Forgot blaming everything China thier huge amounts evidence. Thank God say hydroxychlorquil. @JoeRogan no, doesnt make sense literally say ""you failed"" educators hundreds factors go child's motivation learn. literally top professors world privately tutor someone, home situation fucked, culture completely learning fail. 

in nearly classes teachers creating ethical dilemmas, class debates, discussing current events, etc. teach critical abstract reasoning, cant force someone learn    find weird much pride take life, whatever makes happy. Lots schools GA actually start mid August. watched interview Hill anchors. pissed bad. Kept pushing looter talking points even though short term thing. Couldn’t relate protests all. Sounded like Fox News. 2020, can't turn media, that's works even China. mention there're expats, journalist, diplomats foreign intelligence China aswell selling cooked food, raw food? thought raw. maybe ""no fresh food I'll cook home"".

If outbreak really related raw fish somehow got contaminated: get people got infected. massive amounts viable virus get aerosolized inhaled fish stalls? people start gastrointestinal infections via eating contaminated fish, so, cooking fish kill virus? long general population dense... It’s political it’s dumb. Yeah, ""noped out"" pretty common slang I'm from. never buy concessions anyway guess hate me. nobody said anything stale fish sticks. Again!  average ICU percentage use 57 curious reason always less power get lectured need stop divisive stop punching back. Awesome.

There's lot nothing get done yesterday, need get done today. Yeah, found prosecuted citizens telling us. “Only pussies wear masks”

Ok Iron man, Black Panther, Deadpool, Starlord, Spider-Man, freaking Darth Vader, Mandalorian, Predator, basically every special ops character video game 

It’s amazing many ppl think wearing mask reason heroic except actual save real lives real life. study reports. One. Single. Case. That's exactly point.

 However, reasonable use precautionary principle everyone wear face coverings soon possible

It seems reasonable retrospect given know now. actually recall scientific debate time, lot concerns masks actually counterproductive. control states do. recommend approaches. nothing policies southern states. Stop trying find next boogeyman; go back Bill Gates already. Part worry concession sales, part worry want held liable teenage employee gets shot telling someone need put mask on. read reports people infected one strain. Turnabout fair play. Yet today, article posted sub says salmon throat swabbed came back positive.

Who know. Everything related virus 528 sides truth lies. smartest thing heard say Finger starting nice.... really important. Thank sharing. demand still properties snatched sit bare market price go down. already parts country apartments go empty looked long term investments need rent years long sell enough sell. don’t like masks remind reality live in? Thank Arnie  Yeah nothing projects strength like wearing word “strong” face. Someone listens doctors. Hi. Vegas here. Please come here. Please. need thoughtful thinkers. Thank you. cut mens hair, literally almost every client tries tell fake political plot. exhausting think world dealing american politics (sigh) rediculous even try explain them. know people work hospitals. coworkers definitely ignorant sadly. wear mask CDC says so. Wear scientific studies, common sense, practices countries done well virus show masks work. Cases California rising. It’s happening slow, methodical process there, week week well awful. several articles manipulating data, adding antibody tests one point lower percent positive present data way makes easy seem like better actually doing. really don’t think it’s health medical issue?

It's obviously health/medical many people dying?

Numbers pretty transparently inflated. state DOH admitted least 7 deaths COVID 19 deaths simply coincide deaths. Canada, absolute moron look like joke dude! Sorry, sorry.

Science facts thing? Alright then. Thank making known Canada. Weird point okay. something said freedom tracked government. think criminal justice system unfair, know government would run social justice/monitoring system. Thats called Texas say wearing normal mask (or surgical mask) protects others me. wear mask covers mouth inhale nose exhale mouth, people still protected? 

Or still coer nose protects least little it? fear red paint know... mean would useful laws enforce. martyr!! true hero ages!! similarity sars-cov2 also attack I'm proud Pennsylvania citizen, knowing got control virus early, almost completely open(with occupancy amount restrictions, like 75%, 50% occupancy) still seeing spikes. nightmare fuel.  Unfortunate there’s way around this. Bars, dine-in restaurants, theaters, similar businesses simply safe way operate. Without assistance they’ll go business. confirm. live Spain. OP, that’s socal’s bit (although idk things gonna change governor said required california wear masks now) you’ve learned lesson, obvi... ""Political Controversy."" follow reasoning.. medical thing, would help prevent spread virus.

Granted, who's going go movies right now? good films put delay till 2021 2022. Lol  fuck cares people making fun you? Keep wearing mask state goes phase 3 4 opening. would stop wearing one? look you’re also helping others. Don’t afraid selfish health cus obviously you’re saying people around don’t give shit theirs.

I live Seattle everyone wears mask. get called sometimes wearing one let store. stores nice enough give one walk without one.

I’d tell whoever making fun fuck start appreciating fact care enough health much yours. shit gonna take whole country come together community pisses people convincing it’s flu people overreacting.

Wherever got idea Americans, least states increasing rapidly, following guidelines, sorely mistaken. actuality lot people actually flagrantly disobeying guidelines set forth medical experts country. I’ve seen lives Australia wouldn’t go outside let alone allow cat outback. viruses spread exponentially

Not viruses spread exponentially. example, flu spread exponentially many states reporting data lot similarities. Strange. wonder 🤔 Oh definitely... willfully ignorant refusing precautions biting people ass currently. hopefully people know someone who’s infected, they’ll start wearing masks social distancing, way easier spread area.  Wow, thought Italian politicians dumb. guys take whole new league. miscalculation assuming would vaccine less year (I think scheduled winter) outbreak, Swedish government assumed (correctly) lockdown could last couple months people get rowdy start 2nd wave. international drug corporations pull vaccine end year, hopefully little side effects, I'll give mad props. happened underreporting issue last two days São Paulo state ""e-SUS"" system could update number serious ICU cases.

Lol. employee postal service, HOLD BEER. non optional here. Also, people willing since it’s health others Americans selfish. median average two different things. would certainly want average - rather, want total years life lost (which average times number deaths). Yes, definitely latching onto “we enough beds” “there’s enough ventilators.” means going survive, it’ll fine. Never mind put ventilators COVID survive. Add Ohio list. Masks requirement started re-opening Memorial Day. We're approaching could end beginning new spike it. Bans conservative activists? Shouldn’t “bans refuse wear masks”. Don’t conservative activist asshole refuses wear one. What's deal low death numbers Qatar (93/85000) Singapore (26/41000)? Known reporting issue? less deadly virulent strain? 👀 Right? Feels like needs addressed. Yup. Like Nevada/Las Vegas mandating masks, table games players still permitting smoking. Also, people required wear mask properly.

What's dystopian- people wearing masks people getting sick dying everywhere? there’s enough testing. time future. fact Sweden took extraordinary measures protect elderly shows real strategy. stroke now? need call racist? That's mean 'testing capacity' lol Outdoor cats kill staggering number songbirds every year. sport, feed themselves. interesting ever get detailed data point tell many times virus transported south Florida new York. There's many people traveling areas often. Back Brazil! America's shit show. certain not-very-smart subsections population (not naming names groups, although difficult figure out)... aren't, combined fact southern states opened *way* early recommendations doctors said times would come outbreaks.

And times come. :/ almost 50.000 newly confirmed cases today, believe grim new record. Things looking good Brazil... Pence Permanent masks would dystopian nightmare

Permanent masks would dystopian nightmare, hundreds thousands millions dead people aren't. 

Gotcha. think that’s point. He’s awful. (NYC resident here) Welcome 3000 club Florida!

 \-Texan live near FL let tell you, know southern states butt joke (rightfully so) see many state plates. Nevada, New York, list goes on. 

So mean? means come here, party weekend, bring virus right back home you. **EVERYONE** fool right now. vacation planned south still come here, need head examined. Good luck NY. What? Capita lism shutting stores due Coronavirus? govern ment need force stores remain open? /s  That’s AZ tho 20% infected immunity, hospitals aren’t expecting get anywhere near was. 
We careful enough protect mass spread. That’s truth. Florida even try make reported deaths look organic anymore. Look [this tell one ridiculous things ever seen. put money 47 every day hit half time. Russia level stupid data imagine ones argue medical condition (or qualify) would asthma, COPD, claustrophobic, emphysema, CF, lung cancer.

Of course, people would qualify medical excuse niw wear mask....just happen exact people wearing masks firat place so..... wife owns hair salon. That's I'll say. long tail Illinois awful. still decreased deaths 50%, though cases decreased 15% peak. Ha, well fear kill case. afraid...a healthier respect might happen. following guidelines He’s talking shit people protesting rallies punting footballs Twitter now. Wtf  party actively trying restrict rights gay guy marry, would prefer get fired sex gender, yeah, hate you. problem different opinions. welcome them. problem try impose beliefs limiting rights. hate enough restrict work marry, can’t even adopt donate blood order wedding cake baker, bet ass hatred you.

I've taking shit seriously since March 15th going store like twice since full mask travel funeral. Bunch useless wastes oxygen here.  Well globe warms would mean less coronavirus infections good thing /s Source? half million cases

You mean something like [600 000 reported yesterday? Yet 93.4% deaths people 45 older. really overall putting lot people place can't hide true nature. I'm saying everyone's bad, assumption *most* people would right thing, self-sacrifice safety benefit others, longer thing. Sure, percentage people will, see still, overall much smaller percentage think people would've assumed this. shame, certainly studied ages afterwards, especially human behavior/nature aspect. fucked wearing mask become polticial issue. Like wtf Yes yes yes know either words means, you?  Hahah hey guys said Karen thing! True comedic genius display here!  news stupid Better read dead Yep. protests happened, lot friends gave social distancing began seeing friends again. still stick outdoor activities mostly. probably rate. Trump least letting Fauci job. Bolsonaro, Fauci would fired long time ago look chart? Looks like Harris County disaster, frankly.

Wow, right that... 1,184 new cases Harris county today! user ideas get behind. sort want Lebron mask iMask... Blame whatever want, don’t care. 

Fact is, Florida’s economy built tourists, government reopening economy. don’t think hospitals ever really collapse per se. think fill people get turned away end dying street home brazilains arent givin shit COVID anymore, wrost situation: Fucked economy health wearing mask pandemic plain common sense roommate’s job going back customer homes installations again. imagine within month. 2 look like extras Dukes Hazard. Science racist duh. symbol antifa uses, video dangers antifa. Try again, waterhead. Whoops... Better talk guy's shirt  It’S ViOLaTiOn RiGhTs!!!!!!!!!1111 businesses need make accommodations them, whether disability not, accommodations put health safety others risk. says right American Disabilities Act. Utah. daily testing numbers peaked late April, since time total hospitalization numbers (and daily hospitalization numbers) rising trend. Today also broke previous records terms daily positive cases. Fun times... lack fuck give people living favelas forest makes even alarming True.. hopefully reasonable time everything already super bad live Chicago area, spoke Florida business acquaintance mid April discussing bad situation was. said thought going last long time going rolling shutdowns would open shut again. told want business end news employees got Covid, god forbid outbreak national news. 

He said, ""Wow, pessimistic. Everything open here, people boats, things normal. like 20 people died want close everything down, that's crazy.""

He went say confused ""media panic"", something adding up. deaths, yet everyone freaking out. make sense, said. thought paranoid.

Now see businesses closing second time. see Florida restaurants national news sick employees, Great Clips Missouri, national news infections caused! Everything said I'd happening still beginning. America, elites afford insurance?! honestly think millenials need cause, it, take advantage opportunity good make worth dont really give shit.....

or reduced essential worker, scene.... Dunno guy feel smug tbh. anything thank Sweden lab rat to. USA Brazil reminding Manchester United Arsenal late 90's early 2000's. bad way go Lol, go-to adjective records isn’t it? really wonder, come things happen mostly turn god science help time crisis? Well, reform would imply lessening harm do. 

As far benefits, tourism dollars help local economies ports. Cruise ships supply variety jobs opportunities crew. Cruise ship passengers enjoy experience traveling, visiting parts world, entertainment amenities cruise ship offers. people really love cruises would argue provide lot redeeming value. blame  Yeah, Mexico race too, sadly. Mexico shares Brazil ingredients disastrous recipe: moron President give damn international measures stall disease, give wrong message population, start rallies, even lifting restrictions there's sign reduction infection rates, let alone taste :( deaths month there?  let's make sure everybody knows conservative political affiliation definitely matters situation. Fuckin say jackass want wear mask Straka said interview Thursday night medical condition reason didn’t wear mask. would elaborate condition said airline employee inquired telling get plane. disputed gave conflicting answers medical condition.

This non-sense. Airlines supposed ask medical conditions. ask, he'd say discriminating asking. According American Disabilities Act, businesses need try make accommodations accommodations would put health safety others risk. They're well within rights say needs wear mask plane obligation try determine even disability. every countries world thing 

not Sweden UK  young people causing virus spread thinking theyre invincible going outdoors places people like stores, etc maybe..... I'd guess one way another, everyone incentive seen first ones start, outbreak. one wants next ""New York City"", whatever. one wants shut again, one wants businesses close, people lose jobs, people filing unemployment, putting even stress already over-stressed system.

I see every incentive look good scenario, I've seen, always comes back money. hope states same, private companies, easy hold people's jobs threat, especially things like medical industry, I'm sure get black-listed. I'm sure businesses want hire someone blew whistle, even they're good worker, extra risk, hire someone else.

I hope happening more, Florida taught me, really hard know lot circumstances, unless someone's willing risk future say something. Fuck. Cali peaked deaths hundred. far anyway... 40 million whole experience convinced America take climate change seriously it’s late. can’t convince people serious threat it’s currently killing people, convince something slowly worsens years. declining deaths states hit hard early like NY? mean happened NY happen AZ &amp; TX example. someone explain states choosing place infected nursing homes? Adm. Mike Gilday member Navy. bank it. There's always huge advantage incumbent, opposing candidate weakest nominee since Mondale, Trump's hillbilly voter base exactly type ""haemorrhage"" support. That's interesting take! qualifications data information general continuing normalize ensure healthy people develop immunity? I'm curious think continue reopening Florida states' ICU bed capacity reached? Hospitalization rates lagging factor compared positive confirmation. occur time. countries seeing big increases positives going eventually see corresponding rises hospitalizations. know next lagging factor is. know else raises risk heart problems besides birth control? Also, implant different IUD yes, everything risk, telling someone drop birth control something happened someone else dangerous. fault old people tanking world economy want live forever.

When time go, time go. dont really get unless people gathering enclosed spaces much often.......   Search paper « Macroeconomics Epidemics », written experts National Bureau Economic Research. It’s interesting estimate value human life 9.3 million USD, similar economic value one US Gov agencies place American lives various policies well. Good One many. still don’t get point. 

People lied early on. government hard time back tracking mask issue. admitted lying. provided proof. 

Trump saying something contrary medical leadership saying. exactly point? I’m gonna offer two guesses since expect read mind somehow.

A) think Trump right medical community lying. 

Ok. gonna argue that. whatever feel like right you. IMO, wearing mask inconvenient worst, it’s big deal wear one whether personally think helps not. 

B) think Trump wrong.

Then wtf talking about? Pointing medical leadership lied endorsement Trump. 


I’m starting think don’t point. Maybe I’m stupid. could little less vague, I’m appreciate it. Thanks. Yeah sure $1.1 million.... insurance...

So insurance? i've found way convince sorts people wear masks:

for older people: Fox news start campaign saying according study made wear mask probably gay /s

for young people: Lebron start selling masks asking 400$ piece, would instantly make mask look cool young idiots.

for rich people: Gucci make 4000$ mask, could show rich wearing exclusive mask.

for nerds: Apple release i-mask, works like normal mask white apple logo, design soooo coooool

for perverts: sell used masks worn female japanese students. 

for policemen: make big mask, also cover id-number bodycam 

feel free add tricks use imagine protests, riots, riots, martial law military involvement, much like Contagion movie narrative seem trying really hard follow..... Sadly, neither elected leaders states put “the economy” people’s lives. live Texas couldn’t embarrassed. Can’t speak rest state I’m college town I’d say least 75% people see Walmart aren’t even wearing masks. dick sharing reasonable information? think realise helpful. honestly believe knew, also knew huge shortage medical staff worded extremely poorly public.  Unfortunately FAs it’s like general public. taking seriously (even pilots seems). us are. flights I’ve done recently, masks kept made multiple announcement throughout flight mandatory checks ensure people wearing them.

I know updated announcement plane let passengers know could banned flying us cooperating.

But yeah, I’m gonna put blame FAs aren’t taking serious enough. borded flight right after. important extrapolate data. 30k deaths STATE NY. 18K NYC. One city. 

NYC epicenter WORLD one point Covid. 

Florida, USA, saw happen China. 

Then saw happen South Korea Japan. 

Then Italy, Spain, UK, finally here. 

Why learn other's mistakes? makes sense. 

Look Brazil. logged 54,000 new cases. record. Open windows doors summer time? I’ve staying home except taking short walks every day staying far apart people pass. Like go street let sidewalk. Although today dumbass kids zipped bicycles without warning bothering go street...I live Florida suburb. assume risk relatively low I’m still pissed/anxious Yes, happens everything opening. town era flock over. Many shelter place they’re back state. 

Either way, don’t blame tourists. Blame municipalities opening things up. It’s chicken vs egg, pretty clear cause here. People back freaking rate spread potential become pandemic. has. live Houston, help us  Thanks, that's okay - I'm interested cherry-picked data points. I'm mainly interested tabular data use show overall trends. “Flor covered Medicare, government insurance program elderly, take wallet, according Times” Maybe Elon buy 2 build world's largest catamaran. Thanks :) agree apparent using herd immunity method unknown virus like assumed immunity possible....new information suggests whatever immunity gained may permanent immunity. never opened im going say probably July August....Maybe August.

and let tell you, aint greater hell earth thanto sick heat wave....oh man shit is......

i cant imagine covid19 experience. 

But prayers around catching shit..... Texas 3500  Also let's say vaccine year. might not, let's assume now. Herd immunity said reached 60% population antibodies. would mean ~35k people Florida would get infected every day, average. hospitals would perpetually overwhelmed. Even would take much longer year, would much.

Until we're reasonably sure achieve immunity vaccine better hunker anticipation. mean perpetual lockdown, reasonable social distancing measures result R-rate hospitals cope mid long term. Oh thanks. :) HuffPost mobile drains battery dry. Fuck, Ive never read anything perfect this. wonder knows something don't, like privy data companies public seen makes confident? impression far pretty cautious conservative predictions, otherwise make sense would optimistic. supposed move weeks ago. Dodged bullet wait days, I’m sure we’ll get there. Meanwhile, Alabama . . .

Five thousand spectators allowed attend Geico 500 weekend. People country, congregating two rural counties (up 'til now) low virus numbers.

And need? Groceries beer, course! Flooding grocery stores without masks, area people wearing masks anyway . . .

Good times ahead, I'm sure.  trolling RemindMe! Three Weeks Dude live Brazil, there's supporters moron president think thing. ever told wikipedia articles show much vandalism get locked allowed edited approved users? honestly saw change happen cousins 10 years younger. always ""so smart"". told going go college that's smart, middle class, white kids did.

But went college values shifted began correct aunt (who one insisted needed go college could get good job). time cousins high school teachers know anything, going need half taught, kids need go college get good jobs, didn't.

My aunt understand impacts higher education lot people. understood came back politically active ""smarty pants"" ""smarty pants"" friends challenged things always been.

We talked phenomenon quite bit literacy development courses real thing teachers face trying bring children full potential. solutions difficult, too. educated always best interests uneducated mind, doubly communities color.

The answer build trust communities happens. Unfortunately, people--like politicians religious leaders--who benefit convincing impoverished white communities ones understand working man, education indoctrination, educated, along science, can't trusted. fact teaching critical thinking media literacy side side introducing young adults diverse populations viewpoints *does* tend move people left proof indoctrination. perfect storm weaponizes community's fears losing children way life bludgeon ""the side"".

The educated look people who've created alternative reality belittle call stupid refuse see things afraid they've reinforced belief educated care common man. goes. Oh boy good points. Unfortunately lot people vote ""likeability"", would agree certain positions require least certain amount experience politics, well higher education geared towards politics.

If job posting president would think ""10+ years experience"" ""Have degree political science similar"" would there. numerous trials proving corticosteroids useful part treatment Honestly, I’ve learned enough guy screen grab used link. need review, I’d say he’s piece shit.


Aiight, imma head out. might true some, seeing dense comes matters like Chinese CDC announced back February asymptomatic transmission possible then?   Gottem well, enjoyed kid much worse holiday movies, can't bad! ha ha live Florida, there’s LOT people without masks here, unfortunately. 

Government officials many cities FL torn issue, individual cities lot discussion think mandatory masking invasive personal rights.  hope you’re right. really do. doesn’t feel like people making decisions good faith more. computers would take entire rooms still even existed first place.

So we'd basically living Fallout universe, entails? Great. appeals populist sentiments. He's actually great example ""populism"" bad connotation. Damn libtards msm Always look benefits making things like political position. 

Who benefits climate change political issue? Fossil fuel companies make trillions dollars selling fossil fuels.

Who benefits making mask-wearing, overall perception serious pandemic is, political issue? Republicans convinced base taking precautions spreading disease isn’t necessary, translate higher voter turnout among conservatives November; understand severity pandemic less likely show polls they’re worst-case scenario spreading virus. Polls people confined space extended time, going voting booths touching screens.

Why think Trump hostile towards vote-by-mail? undermines exact vote manipulation effort.

Too bad r/Conspiracy busy talking crazy Hillary/Obama stuff recognize obvious conspiracy today: politicization pandemic order steal election. learned trying teach dude use trackpad laptop. even copy paste normal mouse. loved News Radio. He's great MMA commentator. He's capable interviewer. heard interview Alex Jones, clearly mentally ill, realized willingness give anybody platform actually misguided.

I really appreciate Joe opinions everything, seem take anybody else's opinions own. I’ve seen people without mask brazenly walk right hospital employees scrubs mask. least little shame people. nurses ones risking health safety don’t need immature morons risking lives stupid face mask. obviously, attacked conclusions gathered evidence people would use evidence.

But why. Galileo victim papal politics (he number enemies well prominent supporters within Church, time political religious strife), victim science vs. religion--*that* [""Conflict Thesis"" narrative constructed 19th existed cosmological models time combined older traditions well new evidence, components old models *for conclusive evidence against* existed indeed amended replaced. One presume Galileo's evidence disproved geocentricism proved heliocentricism. heliocentricism would eventually turn correct related single piece evidence, evolving ideas observations long period time, well general philosophical shifts (after all, heliocentricism already become predominant conclusive physical evidence could gathered).

 

Galileo's evidence constructed telescope capable observing moons orbiting Jupiter different phases Venus, demonstrating heavenly bodies orbit around Earth. disproved Plotemaic model, particular brand geocentricism, geocentricism (Ptolemy proposed *all* celestial bodies orbited Earth). example, Tycho Brahe favored combined system geo- heliocentricism, held Galileo's observations prevailing paradigm geocentricism concert. Tychonic model improved Johannes Kepler, another prominent name--these fringe ideas time. Copernicanism superior explanatory power, pure heliocentricism requires stellar parallax (a requirement also noted fundamental time), absent contemporary observations. know today astronomical distance stars responsible absence, again, could determined development much precise tools.

 

Contributing evidence disprove one model automatically constitute proof another (Copernicanism), especially face plausible alternatives (Brahe's). 17th century, nobody evidence conclusively accept reject either, would logical scientific fallacy assume one correct another Ptolemy out. Galileo's evidence decisive contributor rejection Ptolemaic model, *laid groundwork* eventual adoption geocentricism. day, though, people though convincing, others didn't, reasons related unrelated ""science"" (Galileo included), containing individuals affiliated non-affiliated Church.  GOP state congress trying impeach precautionary requirements do.. trump gonna lead us 4 years! sounds like churches casinos two dangerous places go far infection risk. Yup, know actor. He’ll do/say anything undermine trump. Get something new y’all it’s getting tiring point Oh man. Today needed open plastic bag market took literally five minutes can’t lick finger! tempting. don’t think I’ll ever lick finger again, even over. Implying give shit think /u/beggsy909 taking name month i'm going see new bullshit line pushing don’t believe all. loss jobs amount pain suffering death come lockdowns felt far heavier longer Covid will. watch. There’s lot misery don’t see it’s sight it’s coming unemployment runs out, houses foreclose, families become homeless desperate. claim sunlight based strong published findings, public comments William Bryan DHS. sorry misleading inaccurate. higher temperature and/or humidity also claimed reduce half life.
the effects outdoor air flow dissipating airborne pathogens well established fairly intuitive.
i think main point 1) aren’t going get hit droplets outside non-crowded places bc fall ground quickly. 2) aerosols spread deteriorate faster outside. probability inhaling critical viral load much lower outside inside.
if you’re walking around outside area still fairly crowded, it’s still better to
cover up. park sidewalk people everyone spread out, it’s fine pull face cover
*but see someone coughing sneezing, better safe cover Lol shitty jinx Really? I'm Austin see almost everyone wearing one. McKinney falls probably 90% people walking around Yeah keep wearing morons. I'm fine. Never never will. make difference coming He’s comment section lol  lack national “3 point” safety campaign criminal. It’s basic. Simple! Hilarious one calling anybody stupid here. merely commented lack education fact people waste PPE (physicians) could using keep public safe It’s true anyone change it. it’s properly sourced what’s problem exactly? Best. Governor. Ever. take mask shove ass Sure, thing it’s impractical wear exercising, bar restaurant, beach it’s hot. Also good luck getting cops enforce it. don’t think anyone wants give police arbitrary laws enforce. Preach, fence canceling gym membership yesterday read Arnold walked Gold’s Gym. took /r/Florida cancelling membership Crunch Fitness bullshit relaxation face masks. 

If run god damned gym, health priority. Crunch Fitness believes money health. Convinced lot people moron politics. told wrong feels little bad, politicans/Murdoch/conspiracy-theoriest made hay saying ""feeling bad"" wrong is, itself, proof never wrong. No, media amplifies voices wearing masks spreads idea legitimate. protests astroturfed. Sorry, believe ""anything"" say. Joe Rogan buffoon.

He's embodiment ""don't let mind open brain falls out"". Let's hope speedy...🤐 Yeah huge deal. NHS England killing it. breakthroughs, rest assured. listen Germinator. tempting..... f way. allow chemical warfare subs wanted use.. Arnold: **supports making face-masks political issue**.
Arnold: ""Anyone making political issue absolute moron"".  Yup, would second Etsy. Bought kids, became designer, made donation-centred store. Nuts, isn’t it?! calling racists incivility? Thanks; glad know. 

Do struggle racist also? I'm struggling past, least I'm working actively calling racist pieces shit see them. 

I hope too. thanks deleting comment; seriously, need reminders past confrontations.  Chovid19 let’s site huge race massacre, time racial upheaval. let’s let Yuge Racist talking. hear that, Joe Rogan?  Dude morally falling apart fucking mask hes sick home w family wants go back comedy club hang night w buddies.  u think American CDC pretty stupid. wish could unsee multiple facebook posts w/ thousands shares covid/the protests plot make trump look bad. 

Just say 'we're going Phase 3' mean better worse. quick check cases dashboard Google showing pretty steady increase time (June 14, total 891 new cases compared June 2nd 821). smooth line, certainly reducing definitely flat. means going up. can't say 'were done virus' expect true.

No one's doomer. people think there's still danger like mean they're wrong. Maybe tired cautious. Maybe sick COVID...aren't all. can't simply pretend like getting better when--even looking Nashville--it's not. matter 'leader' tries say. Sam Cooke Aretha Franklin? Thanks saying sane things public. could use leadership. Well now, village idiot nominated run show bad shit's bound happen. Living Columbus now! smaller office providing masks customers I’ve pleasantly surprised probably 90% visitors brought own. handful outright denied wearing them. It’s big warehouse I’m overly critical there. Grocery stores go (Kroger giant eagle) pretty decent still. I’d call 75%. places I’ve noticed particularly bad - gas stations outdoors general. new bridge Dublin opened recently driving past maybe handful people wearing masks. bridge park (outdoor-ish retail restaurant area). I’m starting get feeling every one “promising” new/old drug articles written someone trying boost stock. plane private property owner set whatever rules want. Conservatives, people, understand that. idiot. I’d imagine anymore what’s present normally skin air latter. ""Christian"" work tech. universal ""this easy"" task computers. /r/talesoftechsupport confirm 1000x fold.

Its easy you. may easy someone grow computers. Yet are. don’t even think box. Others laid needs happen gain upper hand. Nope we’re good Exactly..Way 25% too. Emerging like Terminator tossed across yard. This. people want isolation continue still get paid whole time. Mostly get paid less work normal times. Touché! That's always thought. Like government keep secrets lil bit, eventually comes surface. matters people care years later. idea crisis actors, local federal offices, deep state politicians can't even name. theses people keeping mouth shut? He’s touch surprised me. won't. awesome dude.  Prostate-icating 😂 Florida man researcher:

It's going bad people going business. hot everyone afford run A.C. people go lot summer.

There's lot chaos going that's related corona. Government services swamped, lots people would unable pay bills refused show work. Basically there's safety net people provided need stay safe, people know able socially distance. Like...it's policies stay home many.

For example, institution work policy departments 25% occupied next reopening phase...when nontrivial number departments possible operate entirely remotely. even mention retail workers make shit money can't afford eat stay home. 

Also police violence protests happening here, NONE officers masks bc state issue uniform masks, assume. really think lot state workers going get sick too. that's even mention protestors tourists lot things discussed length ppl. +1 this. nobody around jogging outside mask around neck. passing someone, pull nose/mouth. One coworkers recently came back someone house COVID. work pizza place says person house fever day fine. Nobody else except person house contracted it. kind interesting seems like hyping makes sense. Multiple people father's work well COVID returned work recovered. worst faced fever. Nobody hospitalized anything. I'm still going wear mask everything cause dont want take chances, think giving COVID much credit. gnus main reason, bet! get it, semi facetious: used often insult boggles mind why.

Is dating huge thing rather move away parents? Especially since there's arguments made moving away days, understand downright stigma associated it, especially online. countries logical response would ""go hotel"" ""book airbnb"" stuff like that.

""He must living parents' basement"" something I've heard innumerable times. directed me, seems like stereotype conflate loser something literally norm countries...which kinda insulting others too. believe San Diego.
Went visit first time last year sister went Gaslight district.
We Latino old ass white man literally pushed side curb street crowded. 
I got mad literally kicked “booped” wrinkly ass started running lol 
Shit jiggled. old bastard.
I go gay bars well old white men much friendlier there. 😤 Whatever happened McGruff Crime Hound anyway?  You’re talking one pole here. Enlightened centrism. Thats power stupid people large groups. takes one liar fluff egos. Joe Rogan perfect case study trying masculine goes wrong sure feel damned lucky live given I'm watching happen around world.  going go movie theater able eat popcorn nachos jalapenos Etc, see point going unless movie amazing. 
  happen, virus gone Vaccine available. Well they’re wrong.

It’s complicated that. uncontorverial stuff like what’s atomic number Boron it’s fine. anything controversial beware. Ok... so... University Utah lost credibility. 

MIT confirms something studies everyone already knows proud it...

Next UofU confirm need wear masks.... 🤦🏽‍♂️ people saying shit like yet deaths consistently decreasing past month half. long expect kinda info lag? fact average decreased nearly 70% peak pretty good sign. pretty much everywhere. to. Education children important figure way it, online home way. pointless completely unworkable quite few.

It may look different, there's gonna lot masks weird desk arrangements, may unfortunately cause teachers quit, happen. We're going ""solve"" problem. We're gonna muddle attend lot virtual funerals (not children though). one day over. Like lady town went national getting going bar beach. works healthcare yet blamed comfort going wearing mask state telling people ok get out. think topics instead blindly following state? Especially work healthcare? 

It's like every government agency bombarding us information need see real threat two weeks average time hospitalization. three weeks death. Delay testing widely, lot contact tracing going around two weeks too. nothing doubling period, one time 2.5 days hard judge. usually couple *more* days test result comes back positive another day test gets reported public. 

What seeing second third generation explosion labor day. opinion piece author Wikipedia page, personal website clearly states beliefs. getting feeling lot people signing support certain movements idea really about. Police reform, working deescalate, less lethal encounters think everyone for. goal though many organizations. Excellent, let's get Asia opened up. seemed like Rogan fake laughing cover fact upset someone disagreeing him. seemed magically disappear thousands rioted groups. Seems strange. live world bunch uppity college students white savior complex ignoring killing/burning/looting cities little wealth have.

We live world people protesting lock downs want get haircuts shit.

We live world care facts unless agree right opinions.

Humanity cancer virus chemotherapy. science ever become superordinate politics?

My best thought would 60s, blew 80s Moral Majority put political social desires science. Lockdown won’t matter people sick work, supply chains break, people scared go spend little money have. It’ll worse lockdown point. Blaming religion anti-intellectualism isn’t necessarily correct. plenty people subscribe evangelical religion intellectuals also were/are leaders respective fields — mention almost science monotheistic countries meant unlock secrets world believed created intelligent design. 

For example Johannes Kepler, credited making laws planetary motion said: “Those laws [of nature] within grasp human mind; God wanted us recognize creating us image could share thoughts.[80]” — Equal opportunity get infected! read still clue wtf causing spread. like former enough evidence supporters. Thanks! subreddit pandemic? would, too, except spread people trying careful don’t think hoax. think designate deserted island ship “this hoax” people least couple confirmed CV+ cases leave there. get consequences don’t share everyone else. take hands approach. recommend starting fingers. doesn’t qualify lol. born Austria 20 million Americans get flu every year. course would lots anecdotes bad flu. Unfortunately, that's impossible. native born citizen. really unfortunate given also relatives adopted infancy could never president naturalized citizens, native born. Likely encouraged/enforced: rest 2020

After that, seems betters’ chance. Seems Trumpian. Even NYC many people walking around without masks. don’t think supermarket someone checking masks. do, certainly don’t seem care people wearing mask nose, effective. 

It may I’m relatively conservative part Queens. haven’t left neighborhood 3 months, hear whole city plenty non-compliant people anyway. 

I try remind compassionate criticize people, it’s getting harder harder. mainly concern staying least 20 feet away anyone without mask. try make somewhat obvious deliberately distancing person. anyone tried wearing shirt says “You wearing mask cover mouth nose.” I’m tempted make one. 

I really hope make this. touch... base girlfriend hospital doctor NYC, I've heard plenty dying.

Look, sucks, family going grieve anyway. families do, part life, nobody's immortal. half deaths nursing homes. People end nursing homes prime..

Yes, sucks, continue wear mask I'm out, go absurd amounts hand sanitizer, there's limits reasonably expect people do.

Preventing grandma dying = keep grandma isolated. 95% us catching never currently keeping alive, overwhelming medical system. currently, nowhere overwhelmed, definitely NYC.

As productive, fun, exciting, summer.. yeah..

NYC beaches opening summer. Museums, Broadway, sports, concerts, dining in, gone. Another 1.5 million Americans lost job last week. single people good fortune someone come home to? date NYC following CDC guidelines? impacts real, they're trivial socially, psychologically, economically. Da man Unregulated non-medicine isn’t regulated FDA may active ingredient says. Nobody testing determine could anything. could saline, could says, could dirty water. even says nobody knows works.

There thousands products like don’t think FDA power anything due products word marketing claim. time done... Honestly done national level Arny. warned us, ""I'll back"" :)

It's good see people stature promoting mask usage. well positioned reach audience/demographic listen Cuomo, et al. Arny someone think holds sway group people need convincing. Wasn’t news couple days ago refusing wear mask gym?  are. Go look Vegas reopening Fremont street YouTube. fuckers flying home states done. That’s trying do... don’t see point Oh, state still ton people BLACK LUNG coal mining boot, preexisting lung conditions. 

Black lung 2020. 

A history tons air pollution related heavy industry too. even people miners screwed. Would sad got hit biggest hurricane recent history paired covid. I’d argue that, cherished beliefs, including religion, necessarily anti-science. possible intelligent still subscribe religion. 

For example John Polkinghorne, former Cambridge professor said....


“Has anyone provided proof God’s inexistence? even close. quantum cosmology explained emergence universe here? even close. sciences explained universe seems fine-tuned allow existence life? even close. physicists biologists willing believe anything long religious thought? Close enough. rationalism moral thought provided us understanding good, right, moral? close enough. secularism terrible 20th century force good? even close, close. narrow oppressive orthodoxy sciences? Close enough. anything sciences philosophy justify claim religious belief irrational? even ball park. scientific atheism frivolous exercise intellectual contempt? Dead on.” — John C. Polkinghorne Hey need sexist since women suffer far coronavirus... Except blaming experts Americans' refusal wear masks \*now\* stupid. better argument blaming decades anti-science campaigns politicians corporations blaming scientists lying refusing tell truth beginning pandemic. They're telling wear masks \*now\*. Refusing little message beginning entrenched politics. strain saw Wuhan, read article?

Not go theory, literally 1st strain Legitimately discussion couple weeks ago one group chats dude idea he's said they're taking bodies car accidents classifying Covid deaths.  anybody clarify model presume second wave nationally September? article makes big deal hitting concurrently Georgia's current rising trend wonder presumption folded in. 

It kind seems like Georgia necessarily receive distinct second wave never stop first one high population infected already. set bunch testing booths pharmacies parking lots whatever around town, get concert/game/event onto plane show negative test result today yesterday along ticket. Please read rational. link web archive page acceptable. Repost link original Wall Street Journal article instead. Judging headline post would absolutely fine. hidden agendas 

I edited comment make clearer. worst hurricane season century hits year.....shunning 2020....just take it.....take it!!! Haha, good. laughed picture going drink 20 bars two days, yeah. job forces daily ass. They're busy, literally none one masks including employees.

It sucks, hate it. 🤣🤣🤣 exactly plan identify people.  coming Florida New York residents. true. heard horse’s mouth. need money due money they’ve lost this. Nice northeast teach there. may 2-3 reasons won’t. I’m pretty sure teachers NJ Massachusetts incredible pay benefits. I’d leave Florida Fatality rate exclude nursing homes LTC like 0.16%.

hint: result fucking obvious. Fauci tell us EXACT cause/origin Zootonic disease then. Casinos like American version Wet Markets problem understand data look go around spouting uninformed opinions flowing lack understanding.

Yes, national death rate dropping, basically solely massive proportion deaths were, time, coming places like NY NJ. original states gotten cases mostly control, national numbers came dropped.

In new states surging last week though, deaths dropping all. Hospitals rapidly filling up, positive test rate rising. Acting like NY's numbers dropping means there's problem anywhere naive take could've come with. Well said. Sad *Oh Florida* agree they're trying draw sort conclusion, really found data support it. 

The data looked March - trying determine much anything spread severity little information actual picture prove anything one way other. protests look like good way virus spread multiple communities infect entire protest. easier inexpensive solution make people wear masks. #Translation

Distancing mask use basically credited getting outbreak NY control, mandating masks didn’t increase movement. I’m PA masks mandated since mid April (same timeframe NY right around peak NY) remained locked June 5 (still severely restricted). data source suggested movement increased masks mandated, infection rates certainly dropped dramatically. fact unaware data source place noted increased movement infectious rate addition mask rules. 


Here’s one study trends flattening worst worldwide outbreaks masks mandated: many studies say same, come conclusions looking infection trends (even movement trends available cell data published) comparing date masks mandated area.

Today, Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson presented economic forecast predicts Sweden's economy fall 6% year. John Hassler, professor economics Stockholm University, think enough.

- rather GDP fall around 10%, says SVT's Finance Agency.

Company manager Gunilla von Platen describes program reality entrepreneurs behind figures.

- carnage there. Every day people called cried said ""all life's work totally blown away"". hugely tough, still tough.

Ever since crisis began, especially world opening again, debated whether restrictions lowered economy harsh not. Save life life later? ""late"" means human suffering comes unemployment, parts world - starvation.

Johanna Möllerström, professor economics George Mason University Washington, behavioral economist states understandable easier respond dangers evident right now, waiting late.

- Life stands life. course, humans feel strongly life right now. politicians make decisions, must perspectives time.

#Uniting economic epidemiological

John Hassler, together researchers, initiated research combine economic models epidemiological, order find measures reduce spread infection without causing unnecessary harm economy. thinks perspective lacking government's work, believes acted unplanned.

- centrally placed crisis group headed Prime Minister provide economic epidemiological skills right balances made. found countries, example Norway Denmark, Sweden.
The economy almost entirely governed pandemic. small flashes light recently emerged, quite catastrophic unemployment US feared, somewhat better situation Sweden rest EU, quickly darken second wave infections new shutdowns. Gustaf Arrhenius, CEO Institute Future Studies believes act differently then.

- Absolutely! already become habit. greater demands normality lower acceptance far-reaching measures consequences. People accept much intervention again. big since seen man's man yet dyin it. :( probably true cities outside there's plenty open space comes cheap, i've spent self quarantine house probably worth 1/4 small apartment inside city almost notice quarantine cause i'm surrounded open space allowed roam into. Lol thought got him. thought really gotcha.

What blind fool appear don’t think you’re quite mentally poster understood US citizens need bit help. think intentional. old people didnt want wear people gamble ask? Idiots idiots matter spread corona. testing = Cases. 

Not saying that's entirely problem, seem coming back. number CASES largely irrelevant. idea many infected people there, WAY case numbers reflect. number cases exponential number... idea high really is. 

Pay attention number deaths hospitalizations. we're getting thousands thousands new cases day, death rates rapidly increasing, that's GOOD thing. means virus less deadly thought (I know upset you). panic headlines like ""ARIZONA SEES CASES SINGLE DAY!!!"" That's media clickbaiting you. Look whole picture. Sure, state telling people nothing politics. Even Norway 2.5 times number deaths would still somewhere around #24 ranking world ""deaths per million"". fucked. Guess Trump jumped wrong stock tip... brother works Costco philly burbs attacked, ahoved cart him, Lady made wear mask. manager back.him people.complain even bother enforcing now.  worked, panic lead changes prevented hospital crowding. people stupid, forget NYC, northern Italy Iran? think would vote Biden point.  Nope all.There's tons evidence ot support statement, coming every single moon!

Oh LOOK ad hominem comment politicizing something need partisan bickering. Congrats widening polarity gap absolute legend, knew could it. Great job! economic statement make objectively false. Oh agree. Finland's history amazing incredible they've managed spite hardships they've faced. 

But one thing admire (general, hashtag Finns) character tendency self-critical. think part successful. 

Jared Diamond goes (perhaps hyper) critical nature Finns one reasons great success new book: agree. many NY/NJ plates Florida past week. middle pandemic quit coming Florida! Sounds like spread slowing down. Maybe due working measures? Maybe due fact capital got hit hard beginning people recovering? sound like mystery me. Yes everyone reddit high risk snowflake. lack proper use/fit home made masks makes completely useless stop spreading virus stop spreading you. one mask certified stop proper droplet size unless N95 rated mask (there research available CDC nature also show N95's might 100% effective someone coughs sneezes). top single fact, single person fit tested, trained proper hygiene wearing PPE disposal procedures. dangerous policy perspective tell everyday public wear mask 100% time. gives false sense security distance, limited exposure time, frequent hand washing, touching face eyes works. mighty sceptical “medical condition” people truly can’t wear mask even 10 minutes. wonder many ever tried. seems awfully high percentage people medical conditions can’t wear masks yet 100% health care workers able wear one. People professions air dirty issue wearing one.

Of course, health conditions could also preclude someone working healthcare much doubt isn’t single health care worker conditions people claimed have. know that. we'd taken another month lockdown, virus would still waiting us extra month. cure vaccine, cannot stopped. Another month lockdown would pointless scheme things. people died, true. deaths would've postponed another month. People sold misconception actually SOMETHING this. cannot. There's literally way could possibly get cases zero. amount social distancing make possible. even social distanced whole year, it'd come roaring back year.

Just say safe. don’t think foresight ulterior motive hear mostly Republican area. Mostly. Although, live urban area mid-sized city, rarely ever anyone masks healthcare workers. hate Trump anything, suddenly say: “no one loves masks me.

Trump populist ever one. whole presentation saving us folk elite, corrupt establishment. negative connotation me. idiots this? one hand attempting moral browbeat people wanting forced wear mask applauding ""protesters"" gather arm arm mass herds.

I guess saying goes ""if leftists double standards they'd standards all"" true. Isn’t song says stupid people?? come from? Masks political issue. Plenty countries got without mask order masks solution, they're stop gap come solution. Americans trying push masks final solution vaccine disastrous. accepting masks solution till vaccine let government skate nothing, potentially full reopening since everyone masks.


The real solution massively ramp testing contact tracing. life village near Frankfurt/Main around 7000 people. total 3 corona cases here. seatgs. cases last weeks.

And still everyone wears masks. walk alone outside, soon enter store, building others are. order wear masks state, one needs control this, people themselves. police anyway, none check first place :-)

In news ""Hessenschau"" talk ""masks uncomfortable"" (which think are) info ""prevention dilemma"": Autobahn sign bridges tell drive 130,120, 100 80 km/h, depending likelyhood traffic yam. good people forced reduce speed 180 km/h 100 km/h seldom observe traffic yam. speed reduction prevented already.

The analogy pandemic clear: wear masks, ""only"" around 8400 deaths whole country (Germany around 1/4 people USA, country would similar kevel, would ""just"" around 33000 deaths). think businesses violate local health orders, liable Quote Newsweek article: 

 *Florida health officials previously told Newsweek attributed sharp increase cases to* [*expanded testing *implemented throughout state since began reopening early last month. However, infectious disease experts government leaders warned simultaneous* [*increases *numbers may signal serious uptick transmission, one could linked loosened restrictions business operations public gatherings.* 

The increase testing evident % positive chart

 

The 7.5% positive rate chart greatly higher WHO's recommended 5% Florida 5% recently. However upward trend increases hospital usage concern. 

The Newsweek article makes mention BLM demonstrations. interesting see demographics breakdown--increases localities big demonstrations, increases age ethnicity. Agree. aren’t. think initial messaging try make sure people needed masks (the medical professionals) could actually get them. Everybody else stay home much possible need use masks.

But mask shortage ended (and proven non-N95 masks help, protect others) fucking President wearing mask help promote usage. nope, approach say people wearing masks must like him. Joe Rogan definitely gonna ranting shit masks pussies surprised hasn’t bigger conspiracy pushed around solve much. Florida understands reality Fox news conservative talk shows tell them.

Yeah, pliant little drone. Excellent. doesn’t apply you. That's horrible! know district yet sure know many districts hybrid model offering online courses depending district, may choose online person full quarter. district's survey last month (omg things changed much since then, need new one haha) indicated online options uncomfortable returning person.

Since governor punted mask question local governments, also depend (whether, person, required wear masks). That's insane - state level requirement schools go back! least city ordering it, school's back point parents city instead trying ""force it"" themselves.

Our biggest hurdle moment funding. way state law written, schools get funding kids physically school first 100 days. Online gets funding even half would otherwise. Hybrid even counted understanding (only days physically there). Big push special session called address this, think many schools winging hoping works right now.

We've talked 99% sure we're physically going back. soon. Worst case scenario, end needing tutors line something like I'd rather alive getting tutors us getting super sick / dying causing others die. Cool, still symptomatic people beds available. used solitary confinement quarantine rest. absolutely nothing fear mongering, perpetuation fear. goofy ass argument.

I’m proud California, first time heard could believe people actually debating whether put mask middle pandemic. also people went far harming others don’t wear one, well attacking people wear one. get people underlying complicated medical conditions could breathe well mask. rest, can’t simply let others be? edge whenever go without mask? wear mask filter I’ll visiting another county within state (county, country) soon. doesn’t feel safe anymore. different places United States experiencing different things.

I’m sure part simple statement understanding.  

There seven known coronaviruses regularly infect humans. four “common cold” coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1), SARS, MERS, SARS-COV2.

There nothing four milder coronaviruses makes anyway shape form less coronavirus. much milder they’ve us much, much longer time. amazon link ""Statements regarding dietary supplements evaluated FDA intended diagnose, treat, cure, prevent disease health condition"" statement, no, FDA approved this.  Agreed. ones kill ones say “I can’t breathe mask” nose completely uncovered, mouth covered 🤦‍♀️

For record work bank, required wear masks, wear one 7+ hrs 5 days week. Much longer normal person wearing one shopping trip. GET USED IT- especially wear properly day one. heat/humidity mask less bothersome, becomes easier breathe, discomfort straps fades, body ADJUSTS. don’t fight whole damn time lol takes one... forgot Arizona, otherwise known “Florida” west. Exactly same.. grandparents health wise pretty good, still seeing them. Keep mind go house social distance ANYWAY can’t exactly sit others laps? 

If they’re going they’re going want know risks, know they’ve got limited time earth worrying BS Finally, Newsome decrees masks. late buddy. done immediate showed people make own. easy thanks So, realize agree science is, said, science list facts.

Also, talking science politics bring climate change arguement say climate change scientific political, say contradiction science. Yeah happens North people used cold weather would equivalent five inches ice Saudi Arabia nobody ever seen single flake snow clue drive ice. 1st lockdown really slow spread, gave places adequate times get PPE hospitals, prepare lot people getting sick once. big shortage masks govt lied us told us use them. Also generous interpretation! Much better ""stubborn resistant new information requires change routine."" Wait till midsummer's Papers submitted scientific journals reviewed peers, (experts), determine correct sure nothing obviously wrong them. process may published wider scientific community test, challenge basically attack. Einstein's theories attack 115 years never defeated. Science require distrust skepticism built scientific method. job support sciences amazed! Feel you, love.

#asparagusURINE. Sit lower spresd even more. recent two cases link existing cases community spread. 

So wear masks make spread almost impossible indoors shopping/ around people. I'm sure many stores use leverage strictly enforce mask wearing inside store. wear mask rejected. 

If there's people walking around outside wearing mask, well mean that's really HUGE deal. Id like wear masks, covid transmit easily outside confined space, large groups people.

If literally EVERYONE blows off, well next step would lockdown. im sure would challenged governor, easy. lived deerfield 3 years boca jacksonville. Deerfield people wearing mask south go less people wearing mask. Jacksonville got anxiety. went take car deive live apt complex. Sp many people walking around, swimming, chot chatting. one wearing mask. pissed lady legit walked right me, full side walk going at, car, decided walk car. wrong people. don’t think edgy means think does. Different populations getting infected maybe? initially spread among groups regardless risk tending spread among lower risk groups less likely take precautions, somewhat constant number deaths many cases.

Also increase cases driven increase testing (which seem entirely unlikely seeing positive % declining), cases month ago, know them.   can’t change past.

that's 8 percent increase. People saying thing TX, FL, AZ too. Anyone die anytime? hard say, kept out,the spread factor increases. whole article disgusting.  It’s hard debate what’s clearly provocative statement aimed getting reaction. expect people challenge on? You’re saying people don’t want lockdown end. 

Ok, someone wants things back go back normal lockdown end, please show evidence anyone wants remain locked socially challenged introverted. please don’t use people’s comments Reddit source evidence. Shhh play doom monger narrative.

NASCAR allowing fans back either weekend next weekend, could enlightening goes, too.

I suspect living least another year best case. Depending summer events go, learn lot fall, heck summer Olympics postponed next year well. Durham North Carolina it’s thing. amount people wearing mask super super upsetting. Based science data. 

There gains.

Anything undo damage lockdown would miracle. know study heavily criticised. John Hopkins official statement request PNAS withdraw report. Combination things. Treatments improved, testing done, many places contact tracing also improved. hot spots due superspreader events suppressed, think unlikely need second lockdown, depending state, course. Yeah think that's even debatable. I'm somewhat shut-in myself, normal times. couple friends small family, game lot, asked 6 months ago would say ""never go out"". also would've (and have, many times) said like people. great job seamlessly transitioned WFH March zero real financial professional concerns me, pretty happy work home commute, taking naps afternoon shit. 

But even me, even favor, we're going 4 months pretty much without leaving house human interaction I'm really starting feel like want get back life, wondering hell anything ever going normal again. feel like I'm far group/demographic people best quarantine, I'm thoughts 3-4 months this, imagine damn near everyone else too, I'm sure hell could last still months more, even longer. If/when drags 6 months, even year more, that's SERIOUS chunk living everyone missed on. People going ok that. already aren't, starts get better part year, that's really getting bit ridiculous. course talking life death vulnerable among us, certain point certain amount lockdown, talking life rest us too.

An important admirable realization make. think [THIS quite nicely! little late going fine billions stimulus packages, hundreds thousands lives lost, near irreparable damage done economy cost trillions.

Fact is, anything, everything slow movement much possible always number one priority.

Galileo's story something ranks along ""Columbus discovered Earth round,"" told often prominently, get oversimplified version little room anything else. testament that, say Galileo ""for sure,"" much story details anybody actually remember?

&amp;#x200B;

Galileo victim papal politics, simplified version ""science vs religion"" narrative one invented 19th century (c.f. [Conflict assumption Galileo produced evidence proving heliocentricism, disproving geocentricism, true. prevailing framework time (Ptolemaic model) held Earth center heavenly bodies. 16th century Copernicus proposed heliocentric alternative, though observable evidence scant. Decades later, Galileo observed moons orbiting Jupiter, provided direct evidence different framework, one heavenly bodies could orbit something Earth. also directly observed changing phases Venus, possible Venus orbit Earth. evidence decisively disproved Ptolemy: especially controversial.

&amp;#x200B;

However, none proves Copernican heliocentricism correct, geocentricism incorrect (Ptolemy extreme form geocentricism--that *all* heavenly bodies orbits Earth). earlier response Copernicus, astronomer Tycho Brache proposed combined geo- &amp; heliocentric model, one consistent prevailing frameworks, also happened fit observations Galileo eventually made. Furthermore, available evidence time (Galileo's included) could fit models Copernicus Brahe. also fundamental errors nobody able satisfactorily explain: lack observable stellar parallax required heliocentricism would resolved development much better tools.

&amp;#x200B;

Ignoring scientific evidence form center Galileo's narrative. evidence produced support Copernican model could easily explained Brahe's. want propose overturning centuries cultural, philosophical, well religious understanding (which formed basic understanding *all* proto-scientists period) better decisive evidence it. Galileo not, even work became foundational future discoveries (this common thread scientific discovery). Cool little bit interaction Terminator. CEO said due wanting ""political"". Nice story wrote, though. Farrrk dad moving Delray Beach - anyone lives Florida know Delray lately? plans socially distance anyway model citizen mask use, generally speaking. people responsible?  It'd different story South Korea's track trace system. 


There would load evidence could implicate certain businesses hotspots transmission. 100 customers walk-in week 20 positive COVID-19 thing common walked store week, business owner, I'd sweating bullets. People still drive. keep going period, though? Like virus became weaker. That's notes define it

Tldr upper bound threshold value total fall 95% time fifty percent time Sorry hear that. No, never got memo. Perhaps you’re right. Thanks lesson. explaining tuning meant. Per capita, cases AZ growing 3x faster Florida. going one people laughing nervously insisting never actually said couple years. need common sense

Not common commodity. Oh Arnold. ship sailed. leaders made political let tens thousands ignore social distancing measures (that far effective masks btw) protesting. Now, try shame people calling morons, it’s going fall deaf ears average person recognize hypocrisy. hurt Covid cause? Absolutely. situation leaders create try pick choose. Good you! used wear N95, even felt weird mid-March. Now, happily give fuck people think wearing full-face respirator hot-pink 3M P100 cartridges. rarely get weird looks, even do, think they're envy (instead ridicule). least Los Angeles County. Yet somehow bet people drinking alcohol close proximity masks down

Not mention touching... Lots things. casino. truly wonder well revise way casino operates way requires patrons handle amidst pandemic. Right. one 3000 people probably encountered 100 people two weeks time. That’s 300k people trace isolate.

Okay. check back when? Another week? statistics say otherwise. Columbus mid-March Memorial Day. first people really good social distancing wearing masks. went back weeks ago noticed lot people weren’t wearing masks pretty antsy get back “normal.” stop voting in!  dumb liberal, too. Dumb LEFTIST (not liberal, actual leftist) bit harder still possible easy come by. experts paid. whoosh yourself. Coupled another market crash. shit gonna worse 2008.  Yeah see people say it’s organized hoax. I’m like 195 countries? 5 million patients? doctors hospital staff? make trump look bad? Ok. Like POTUS, right? Amiright? This, 100%. Orange County, California tends conservative Los Angeles-proper, least historically. assume mask-wearing less-adhered there. Comparing young men died war coronavirus deaths pretty gross. totally unrelated. get it. It’s lot. Well Oxford one already saying would likely last year. told FLA going NYC almost two months ago. never happened. goes Georgia. 

Of course know deaths lag. I’m saying death surge unlikely happen new infections likely younger people. 

Two weeks right? I’m Arkansas, god damn right. Sophomore year, Biology, rich kid who’s parents hotel shit argued Teacher evolution. Why? religion. Nothing believe real. Nothing faith certain. Science tested know. right wrong. Freedom speech religion doesn’t mean aren’t stupid wrong, means get be.

Streetlight people care people distancing wearing mask. Sure. knew face masks helped prevent Coronavirus spread. pushed lie hard face evidence helped.

And they're trying convince people wear masks, enough people made minds help. 

Heck, I've even heard say masks might make worse, since make touch face more.

It short-sighted lie long term made virus worse. they're willing lie one thing, else lying about? 

I expect 100% truth everyone time. trust anyone Trump adminstration, including Fauci, surgeon general, anyone CDC. integrity gone. Oh shizzz . . . that's am. That’s great question - entirely sure, probably shortages. important thing situation make sure patient physician wearing masks. It’s shitty patients put compromised positions receive treatment - I’ll going radiation oncology training internship it’s going interesting see changes everything.

And thank well wishes! This

What going people comply? law needs created ASAP outline happen people comply. also think masks widely available need, include homeless people. 

1st time offense - warning

2nd time fine

3rd arrest Baseline average deaths preceeding years time point, adjusted population. actually really close year. Seems like pretty cavalier approach.  
Wouldn’t choice play statistics roulette Corona, it’s insane much anti mask shit here. city gonna spike soon Well sucks. got email school district kids decisions made online school still strong possibility. It’s win situation. I'm sure there's real evidence one way - I've seen speculation believe based seemed discrepancy bad got Italy NYC vs Wuhan. Assuming based problematic reliable data China (and various differences affect spread).

I could wrong, believe there's functional difference. become unmanly care well others? understand people. seem equate ""man"" ""jerk"". Arnold's favorite word. Yes, saying correlates original point. everywhere around time. 2ish week difference Italy NYC seeing gigantic surge hospitalizations ICU admissions... along fact showing evidence December would suggest same... started slow... grew exponentially rate.... maybe Italy first undetected case early December NYC week later. even earlier, actually knows. global travel people products, connected comes contagious virus. Lost died? paper using term ""resurgence"" strange fashion. 

""Resurgence"" usually refers increasing rate infection initial decrease ***population***, individual human beings. I'm confused term used describe re-detection coronavirus genetic material plasma following couple negative tests.

""Reactivation"" refers situation pathogen rendered harmless actions immune system subsequently become ""active"" again. E.g. reactivation TB caused *M. tuberculosis*.

And finally, two separate infections, would ""reinfection."" E.g. reinfection dengue fever (a flavivirus) causes even severe disease humans.  Anti intellectualism part north America's culture. Everyone struggling soon millionaire. can't stick head sand expect come everything better. people idk...I guess they'll believe others long they're told sounds good  flu dies summer can't handle heat. Covid-19 care heat reset period like summer reduce spread. Think held new Bond film release pandemic. Deaths typically require 25-28 days post-infection show statistics. 

Cases started accelerating 2-3 weeks ago.  

Unless you’ve magically made virus less virulent, deaths begin rising soon (hospitalizations already increasing). they’re good enough job testing/contact tracing keep social distancing. Who’s anyone kidding... theaters packed day 1. Coronavirus ended month ago longer issue.  teacher too. meeting today next year might look like. kept talking “opportunities us remove masks,” “it’s healthy us wear masks eight hours day.” 

I keep thinking I’m going end quitting can’t effectively teach brain consumed thinking ineffective enforcement safety measures fact colleagues believe hoax. also can’t mentally handle working environment they’re figuring fly. understand AMC even still business...they really assets...a bunch seats popcorn machines projectors...as far recall rent buildings...PLUS huge debt... 


I believe hype purely investors...this company going survive pandemic...no way hell. Remove gov bad job! Letting people get sick die guts two year old say NO. Put masks stop spread! ""When attempts reform fail, again. We’ll still here, abolition side.""

""We believe world zero policy murders zero police"" - Official Twitter BLM DC

June 12th 10:48 PM. Look yourself. official BLM affiliate So, cool. anti-science.

Something tells anti-science, though. 

I did, afterall, find comment sorting controversial. like even going new movies anyway. point, isn’t smarter test people instead making quarantine 2 weeks? wonder many people take literally though. Take dog quick walk, nobody around you. Get yelled “Breaking law”. Go walk, nobody around you. Get yelled recorded breaking law. president never said Im contact tracer working texas. 

Just wanted give ground level update Texans. 

The program close getting full speed. process seems effective fast, long apps working properly. Developing brand new training, apps, processes remote work hiring huge workforce qualified people obviously huge challenge. close beginning make large impact. Yeah know. Lol Hi guys,

Last time here, [posted written (based lot data analysis) well, kinda got shredded, despite 15+ citations credible data sources.

6 weeks later, medical community coming around agrees blood type big predictor COVID-19 outcomes – even predicted O-types lowest risk.

I humble brag I'm back another deep analysis think source outbreak based test positivity rates around world. Believe – tiny Sub-Saharan country (not source outbreak), gives us critical clue is. hope read open mind (and downvote shit trying research analyze data – I'm pretty damn good I'm still human).

I doctor – pretty kick ass data analyst. article contains 20+ citations reports WHO, UN, international agencies, major media outlets well local journalism (see let know think Thank kind words! wish y'all best well! One adjustments realizing nothing far away. Good luck! It’ll long time you’d repeat beer I'm pro-mask, seems like simple enough way person keep virus themself. wonder sometimes...weren't wearing masks Wuhan? remember thinking late January - early February masks helping much. ok Lex Luthor... Feel like I’ve reading exact article Florida months now. less serious, serious before. difference lessons learned treat better, virus dangerous before. Even die suffering health issues long term health issues.

And Sweden much showing case. anything, showing 'herd immunity' going work pandemic. working home still. go walks/hikes around neighborhood various parks. shop essentials I’ve also bookstores times (wearing mask occasions.) So, yes.  Abbott sure Dallas trying require masks even though took away punishment wearing one, he's claiming jailing people it. let's cities mandate masks  What? Yes vitamin save day. don’t forget essential oils. everyone understand losing doc pandemic makes hundreds people won’t get care.

Reddit full people needs many, affects them. cops stop murdering people then. Oxygen one oxygen carbon dioxide two oxygen therefore twice good!!
 2 1 

fuckin stupid science nerds stupid books tryna convince need oxygen two oxygens bad keep extra oxygen themselves. Big oxygen controls science wake sheeple!!!! suggest do? Fully roll back lockdown let society get absolutely assfucked? people ignoring completely lovely see.

We still hysterically afraid severe underlying health conditions cautious people consider corona big deal great.

Life lived. wear one beginning honestly care got COVID not. changed started reading protect others asymptomatic. doesn’t help governor didn’t even want order stay home first place pressured healthcare professionals. First opportunity had, suddenly went 0-100 testing opened week protests. It’s insane. Masks reduce risk contagious virus spread one person next. Put mask. They're even releasing weekly now. said something wanting ensure data accuracy date death still sorting out.

Suspicion others want numbers look good get tourists back.

[Here's older article five days ago, still Ah feel like crowd pantomime shouting Fauci ""he's behind you."" sub literally calling solo swimmers got arrested selfish assholes want kill grandma.

Watching narrative double speak social distancing related Covid unlike anything ever seen life.

The thing even tried suggest may even bad people would lose minds personally attack like science settled 4 weeks it.  completely controlled distraction free environment updated theater 

Pray tell, mythical place?? got listen someone talk overblown virus response get ""that bad."" one dem gov states locked hard. reason numbers skyrocket. rep gov thought lockdowns stupid, we'd screwed. people understand successful lockdown one seems like overkill?? means worked! I'm really sorry hear that. sucks. check app.org *hmmm* usa doctors... company's Riverside office decided Monday great day bring WFH employees back office. fine home. take risk? local target person door allowing people enter mask. pretty easy enforce. Let's get one thing straight: people refusing wear masks would've done regardless Fauci said. People social distancing protest packed together screaming singing Must swan song. 
Poor guys gonna get sacked orange menace. 
Thank Doc. Yup, god forbid sets example practicing recommendations medical experts government. wonder folks act wear hard hats construction sites wear seatbelt driving. Seems like issue I'm stoned definitely need restate lol sorry  US cutting education budgets all. We're spending per pupil ever many peer nations. getting idea from? needs check Arnold Schwarzenegger. Manliest dude there.  Wont even go inside gym people arent wearing masks. must watching movies am. start giving free masks. Virtue signaling get far. much pressure reopen. 

lockdowns suck. Japan South Korea large avoided contract tacing, good behaviors people.

if waited another 3 weeks reopening...cases would probably spiked up.....but would taken longer.

its staggering quickly happened. required masks. temperature checks.

Also drink popcorn refills.

And many new movies coming out. Lmao indeed. “People may die EcOnOmY must live on-“ little different New York, seems like everyone flocking Florida vacation right now, they're going bring back home states. Mass protests aren’t compatible shutting might solution place question McDonalds, get jury duty summons kind legally go. short term, would recommend go. here, 8 hrs day, 5 days week. store requires masks, also providing disposable masks customer don’t bring own.

It’s amazing many people tried argue way it. favorite far “I medical condition precludes wearing one.” logistics would nightmare. would mean finding temporary housing thousands medically fragile people moved make room CDC weekly excess mortality numbers out. recent week, still weeks ago, generally accurate. right. wen't check many **new** cases Sweden **TODAY** +1481.

Then calculated ratio New Cases/Total Population 6817.

The ratio **today** second highest Europe (first Russia).

And like 7th world.

In words, pretty fuckin' bad. terrifying sounds? Let's see even least even Ya think?!?  absolutely right desperate play. hard tell believe optimism trying wish so.

And definitely going chicken egg situation. studios going push releases reasonable belief theaters full theaters can't really open nothing show. year 2020, easier ever rob casino. wait July 4th weekend. Another company developing device Israel: Nanoscent 

It seems advanced stage testing, currently 1,000 sample trial hospitals 

 Probably verb equivalent current tense. 
(Writing code post doesn’t get deleted). Preach every protester. saying people don’t know wash hands, put plexiglass, get tested get sick, wear masks crowded areas, etc? exactly thing. Dengue Corona one thing common: healthy people hardly die either Corona dengue alone. Especially Brazil goes hard time year. much better Indonesia. Especially capital Jakarta excess deaths since beginning year combined dengue outbreak never seen before.

That populations less healthy much mor affected Corona others problem related Corona problem related general health policy country. tryna hear complete moron yA DoNt FuCkEn SaY one area. Depends many takes president politicized them. Whats crazy concerning downward trajectory (and notice trajectory reopen well)- tenn trending down, says trajectory reopen- yet counties like Davidson still moving forward (despite still increasing trend, put phase 3 twice, announced today phase 3 continue Monday, even though still increasing- know keep saying it, come on). state moving forward. It’s like local governments totally given attempt. know whole point wasn’t eliminate virus, make sure hospitals could handle influx points- continuing forward knowing track merely saying “we’re worried, we’re crisis” seems silly. Yeah we’re crisis NOW- isn’t making sure stay way!

Sorry rant, I’m irritable constantly surrounded pure idiocy selfishness. Jared place government. God forbid Okay, rough. mother-in-law diagnosed leukemia hospital double pneumonia. tested multiple times covid negative. prognosis good long battle recovery. live nearby city (about four-hour drive) thinking going stay gets hospital (my husband two kids). father-in-law works full-time husband child. need people around help shopping/cooking/cleaning driven hospital treatment tests. Obviously opens us exposed virus (and live Arizona), feel take risk sake. advice? can't see going, take every precaution we're there. enforced nobody. cant wash ? every case gets traced back person reveal gender, age, live, work, gone last days. awful lot work cook fake something  realise that’s impossible

other places done much better job USA gotten cases would stop countries like Syria, India?

Iran 190,000 cases since start outbreak.

we almost many past **7 days.**

that bad blowing it. Bruh white privileged pandemic lmao. honestly don’t even know you’re arguing second paragraph man. you’re willing go twice week power you, I’m trying point millions us literally option. Relax guy, even trying attack you, trying educate. Millions hospitalized? Let’s real here.

We dealing disease kills you, big “if” 95.5 percent survive, typically steal less life simply obesity. almost half Americans obese. gotta ask. quality life like obese person compared non-obese person. lot abilities impaired life condition. yet campaign normalize condition. “Healthy size”. even got it, still wouldn’t shorten national average lifespan much obesity, likely wouldn’t negatively affect living years much degree.

So need calibrate collective fear bit. Yes risk, one countless public health risks facing. public health crises bigger Covid-19 scared Covid-19 new. Everyone joking quarantine 15 example. portion number county cases still hit triple digits, everyone acting like over. Went municipal building yesterday one wearing mask one woman even came right behind me. like people stick heads sand hope matter.

I go many places, do, masks hit miss best. Sweden managing phenomenally, less 6000 deaths 4 months lockdowns. They're handling well countries like Norway U.K admitting lockdowns wrong policy like Sweden. 

Less 200 deaths working age population. 

And Japan never track trace system, they've spoke implementing one really use it. true cases people reasonable would expected come contact covid would doctors. 

On April 3rd, ~1250 people died means that, assuming IFR 1% simplicity, 125,000 people infected ~2 weeks prior April 3rd. April 3rd, likely least 1.5 million people US infected assume doubling rate 3 days unreasonable point time. drop high school something? food made magical material resistant viruses? trying argue viruses cannot live surface plants animals (or material contains said food...) asanine. Counter table? Sure thrive that. Sandwich wrapped aluminum foil? Nah food inside imparts magical antiviral properties, it’s fine 

Please inform stop hating science poor uneducated. It’s actually easier understand think, although I’d honestly say hope someone dumb It’s way round me, long someone doesn’t wear mask doesn’t come us actually wearing one, I’m good six feet distance. keep walking, away gone. It’s themselves, health probably state. Lol. know day. see new cases fall line Italy. Philly opened more, cases steadily declined. haven’t spike all. that’s what’s happened SK Australia, yes. We’ve 30% decrease cases across state well last 14 days.  feel bad trans people Chicago COVID-19 variant appears directly early outbreak China, experts said.


That’s interesting piece article. Faced family member recently. I’ve posted articles support BLM defunding police recently, family member kept responding aggressively possible. publishing company recently gave away free ebooks precisely issues posted links free ebooks. family member aggressive suggested get books wanted debate issue, stated possibility nothing right author idiot agenda. go: perfect example cited here. really needs end... r/Masks4All California: make sure wear masks getting dangerous there

Also California: we're full reopening- Well totally agree. SARS, MERS, SARS2 common common cold. definitely know sure. guess I'm putting money response similar SARS1. I'm also realizing there's much us developing immunity fighting virus without immunity solely depending antibodies. Antibodies great I'll take chance, think they're *only* silver bullet. going disaster without covid Gee thanks. struggling mean first kids. dad made $18 hour separated two years ago. got fired job beginning year stopped receiving child support.

It’s roll dice like original comment stated probability totally fine 90% ,having serious symptoms 5-10% passing away 0.5% less, assuming even get infected. Use brain Googled usa gdp (20 trillion) divided 200 million working-age people. use full population number smaller. think frustration (for free!) can't see loved ones (including kids) ICU. lots time think happened. world feel sorry ""But wanted go park! give shit anyone getting sick, frustration.""

Geez! feel man, tiring fight dumbasses idiotic simple thing. Like rights wear mask important right wanting give Corona virus immuno-defficient brother low-effort bullshit lol. mean, wanna tell rather live society half million people (including children) homeless sell house another hundred grand, fine. least honest. that's okay with. president pretty “against poor people”, probably even “make harder poor people, need learn!” sort guy, so... needs arrested. I'm pretty willing go early, too. immune system historically extremely strong. whole lot concerns covid personally, vaccine even less concerning me.

Besides, else supposed get superpowers? Thank you, you’re good person I'm person asked, similar experience.

A lot folks crazy per se, they're suggestible, imbibing steady stream propaganda misinformation. members family really gone not-previously-existing ideological deep end two decades Fox News constantly background. Particularly post-9/11 and/or since beginning Obama admin.

Fox News like drug them. I'm exaggerating, first instinct turn morning even actively watching it. tireless unceasing presence, shouting watching whispering they're not. witness amping return watching actively, there's palpable change demeanor. Whenever go houses, ask turn mute it, using true (and case, convenient) excuse hearing damage makes hard hear conversation background noise. like clockwork, slowly ramps response. wish could help myself, need intervention expert specialist cult deprogramming something, can't compete Fox News; every day I'm not. Even there, limits; teleprompter full talking points staff editing make look slick. look stuff like anyone else time TV pumped 5 things refute.

So try stay calm make common sense observations non-confrontational way. they're really keyed something anybody contradicting them/the TV, try change subject. grandma, aunt uncle, mom's husband's family, parents childhood friend like family...I feel like can't reach them, really sucks. Yeaaaa glad Bill Burr bitchslapped anti mask bro science latest podcast Went Best Buy buy brand new MacBook today. went wearing mask wife.

I'm suburbs close DC seems opposite here. masks people see. reports. I’ve seen lock downs helped, masks help, social distancing helps. Government thinks smart people dangerous. 

Smart people think government dangerous. 

Dumb people think chem trails vaccines dangerous.

Our education among biggest fuck-ups entire country and, somehow, generation told “go college” telling Trump smart best person run country. honestly feel boomers victim systemic dumbing society. people told go college saying college full quacks leftists don’t know ass hole ground.

You look ""experts"" are. one single person, matter many lies tell Yeah. I'm worried people celebrating Juneteenth tomorrow. gonna mess. r/noshitsherlock That's much. suppose think terribly clever. signed order, required enforced. ”reminds” ”required”, hold water.

Here NYC required wear masks 6’ cant maintained. That's quite subjective even police care.

Btw anybody knows put hard order enforce penalties? way see one big BS/cat mouse play masks. Excess mortality support claim particularly bad flu season. Worse last year, bad year before. can't count hospitalizations differentiate hit children versus elderly, though. insistence arguing COVID flu illogical. outcomes (hospitalization rarely death) solution (stop breathing people). believe bad flu season that's even reason take containment seriously. 

Aside massive IFR difference, coronavirus many times contagious. need worry stopping flu March, there's way could survived significant numbers. Omg literally parents. text exchange mom yesterday.

Thank Governor, seriously; Thank You. read linked article? good point. Imma use future Yeah, gotta agree that. avoid besieged social media?

Don't log on. Coming dude said face masks wouldnt prevent covid Defenestration one favorite words. Considering germany (for example) like 4800 total active cases, absolutly insane point time change deniers

Yeah, people deny climate change. deny models accurate.

And considering Ferguson used retarded fucking model showing millions dead, creating lockdowns, current proof models garbage.

And answer ""climate change"" infringement rights government ""safety""...yes, would weak person morally, spiritually, physically even slightly skeptical. think bigger problem people believe whatever corrupt media news tells them. Four legs good two legs bad that's problem. Everyone passes someone else's numbers that's misconception spreads Reddit.

You may totally right excess deaths idea honest. talking specifically claim pneumonia deaths they're trying cover coronavirus deaths. Midwest turn hotspot \*yet\* think. way people acting Wisconsin, fucked month so.  20 seconds enter per person 50,000 people... still gonna slow things down, could doable. Unfortunately every person reject entry would standing crowd people potentially hours finding this. Gotta admit, becoming vampires would protect Coronavirus. big deal lungs destroyed survive head. bunch idiots.

AMC toast there’s vaccine. aren’t telling employees know? annoying, cuz sell individual masks almost ppl masks wanna buy one still give shit wanna get service. Get fuck outta here. ppl practice measures risk give Corona virus cuz obvious taking precautions anywhere. biggest red flag.

Do also admonish doctors reassure patients gonna die triage? sister called arrogant asshole saying defer scientific experts claiming coronavirus hoax.

Yeah....no. would take beach Florida hospital day.  Okay, getting pretty damm scary now, happens start seeing 50 60 thousand new cases day, like New York State March April? **China's response consequences**

Faced wave complaints, **Beijing announced end April confiscation 89 million poor-quality face masks** , addition 418,000 pieces protective equipment, reported Gan Lin, responsible market supervision administration. , who, however, specify proportion products confiscated destined export. According Gan, also confiscated disinfectants failing comply rules. value merchandise valued 7.6 million yuan (about one million euros).

The Chinese authorities, however, attempt defend international public opinion, assured complaints quality medical equipment ""do reflect totality facts."" “There actually several factors, fact China different rules usage habits countries. Inappropriate use may raise questions quality, ”said Jiang Fan Ministry Commerce last month. Despite response, Beijing pledged tighten export regulations require products meet Chinese standards recipients.

**Those measures poor quality protective equipment exports caused air freight rates even higher** , [*The Load . Also, increase customs inspections.

On Tuesday, Chinese Ministry Commerce announced strengthening supervision quality exports ""non-medical"" masks, including blacklist suppliers obtain export certification.

""In Shanghai, customs brokers increased rates export clearance six times due additional paperwork processing time,"" said **Norman Global Logistics (NGL)** . ""So far affecting Hong Kong, Guangzhou Shenzhen regions, expect occur rest country, **at least 90% medical cargo require customs inspection** , **"" he** added.

Manitoba experiencing exponential growth, barely hanging 8 cases. entire total # \~300 cases, percentage community spread ? 10% ?

My point mandatory mask decree, general confusion virus' spread. Yep, nothing way bigger travel hub basically epicenter viral spread vast majority east coast cases way less prep time geographically distant carriers entered US Lol Nebraska sucks every way. There’s reason everyone flies it. Field hospital south Florida fairground! Maybe lack empathy part, cannot see reason people readily willing buy apparent collapse entire Covid-1984 narrative. long people acting like this. People swedish way. It’s definitely increasing trend. couple weeks ago seeing 2-400 new cases day, we’re almost regularly seeing around 600+ new cases (today 667). Around 12% tests positive today’s numbers. Testing stayed pretty steady, slightly lower lately actually.

The problem shouldn’t waiting get “too bad” deal it. That’s whole point efforts, isn’t it? strange people disdain methodology. ignorant become source pride?  people respond well nice detailed, nuanced explanations. people respond well clever slogan like shower thoughts.

You can't *make* someone understand... point obvious. act self interest.

Also, mask *can* protect understand infection control, obsessively diligent use right equipment. N95 mask, surgical mask cover, double gloves, goggles, proper donning/doffing, hand cleanliness, PPE sterilization staying away crowds, simply gonna get respiratory infection. Yeah... mask sufficient, necessary significant. education would help (and widespread particulate filter masks.) far Pennsylvania, 16,000 patients nursing homes gotten COVID, 4000 died. That's 2/3 death toll Pennsylvania whole. could repurposed facilities few/no patients moved, repurposed hotels, college dorms, whatever. point 4000 people killed Pennsylvania necessary. admitted lying Americans needing masks surprised? Yup observer bias. It’ll hotter’hades. **Sarcastic Response:** Well, because, see... that's old testament. New Testament, Jesus love warm-fuzzy feelings, people think *""plagues, swarms locusts, deaths first-born""* stuff.

[Fauci straight admitted lied Oh now?
Even though we’ve told months wear them?
Just “everything opened back up” doesn’t mean it’s safe. wear mask, wtf hard it?! don’t think state outside mask policy, it’s always indoors problem guy standing front picture Right??? wish country would tell keep safe! VIRUS SHOOTING US Asymptomatic transmission already mainstream news since late January: yet, mask guidance change April... Come Alaska. wouldn’t believe nonsense going anti covid crew, it’s bad doesn’t kill many people.

It. Is. Insane. *field study* terms purity, there's *immense* amount uncertainty Physics largely exist Mathematics, right metric measuring similarity/difference, metric used here.

Mandating cool, can’t push patriotic duty?   Absolutelynright. America one countries kids taught cost knowledge, freedom liberties. learn vague twisted history war independence one really taught cost things handed platter. taken granted. Kids allowed coast education. thats different lengthy topic. lot countries people constantly reminded worth certain things knowledge lot weight. include health experts deemed mass public gatherings safe protesting racism, assessment right?  guess saying cases rising locked hard then... science masks (v coronavirus strains) gathered since SARS, almost 2 decades ago. Fauci company KNEW masks effective start, 'lied' public specific word games general population doesnt understand (masks arent **proven** effective *against COVID 19* ). could stock masks frontline workers, failed properly anyway. commandeered supply line masks begin wouldnt eroded trust office would actually succeeded job building supply. Further, anyone clue capitalizing willful spread ignorance hoarding. 

 scientific 'consensus' changes every month, problem oracle 'consensus', actual change. couple months hardly time put single rigorous study, much less significant peer review.

Fauci gives science bad name politicizing  Womp womp.  Wow, noticed Nd kind assume scam.
FDA apparently looked this, there's lot OTC stuff dont. long meets certain safety guidelines FDA wont go it, doesnt mean works, isnt, like, 50 percent arsenic something.  GOP death cult. crazy. record broken. *shattered*. Watching NY scramble save face pathetic.

NY state 1600 deaths per million, compared Florida's 145 deaths per million. rest Oregon generally behave way Portland. Rural communities are, part, wearing masks. general, daily walks problem. Outdoors, packed, moving low risk get. saw chart risk versus actives day can't find (maybe link sub even) walking outdoors lowest risk category.

The probability getting virus proportional close long exposed that's mitigated good air flow outdoors makes much lower risk.

Another big factor density people near it. live area little obviously chances go accordingly. Problem is, mask deniers worried themselves, anyway. guarantee every single mask denier everywhere believes damaged covid. live rural CA; 2 weeks ago, maybe one person 50 wore mask. Grown adults would see mask, giggle, nudge friend point me. 

Now Governor CA requiring everyone wear mask inside public space, I'm wondering many people actually comply. frustrating part is, protect mask wearer - protect people around them. common frikkin courtesy; almost every person's parents told them, one time another, cough sneeze people. hard people assholes? counties require pants government buildings? R u fuckin kiddin me? You’re fully staffed?

Nursing chronically understaffed nearly 20 years patient ratios far ideal.

I’ve mildly sore throat past 3 days, really thinking much it, reading comment stressed I’m fixated lol. severely sore throat? others Hampton’s? Also - pink eye? Haven’t heard symptom before! Glad you’ve basically recovered though! Except SARS MERS, know, Covids closest relatives, don’t show reinfections.

We need stop general “well that’s coronaviruses are” realize looking comparisons SARS MERS. Comparing common cold coronavirus useless Asthma, heart problems (currently wearing monitor get diagnoses doc), PTSD lucky negative blood... left house since March 27th unless go doctors. miss really life cards highly stacked get sick.

And yikes: yes bad timing Midsummer. :( Hahaha. forgot &lt;INSERT US STATE F\*\*\*ED!!!, optionally &lt;INSERT US STATE gonna next Italy!!! Well, yeah. early March nothing like United States. flew Orlando Chicago mid March 100% business usual. saw two people masks, total, airports. Anxiety induced seeing masks real thing jackass. guess I'll deal hope temporary measure, scares might temporary. similar experience -- traveled Minnesota LA end November music festival week later partner sick weeks. Terrible cough, low-grade fever, lethargy, loss taste. ok 2 weeks partner sick like 3 4 weeks, eventually going doctor afraid pneumonia. got flu shot unexpected illness chalked weird strain. well could regular flu like you, I'm 100% convinced covid. yeah science people lie masks ineffective save supply chain hard trust things saying anymore. that's partly fault Fauci! labeled many professionals “Covid contrarian” one holds personal beliefs many Covid related issues. anomaly, opposed majority highly educated scientists. Every group people decide go evidence suggests, attention.

There many many experts agree Ioannidis. Whatever news watch tries convince isolated cases. anyone else go shopping early morning? Pretty annoying basically wake right Walmart open since many around aint 24/7 anymore. way less people used last resort virus. allergic reaction medication years ago resulted loss feeling/circulation fingertips years, bags bane existence. usually try buy prepackaged produce that. [""No Gotta love chinese bots. Fauci said masks weren’t helpful. Let’s everyone keep believing people lie say they’re telling truth lol 🏅 def odd even outdoors people packed shoulder shoulder, many wearing mask pulling hot conditions, yelling getting hit tear gas little spread. know outside means less spread one would think people close together matter. little spread really wonder annoyed actually took time look links found quotes contradict claims? Hahahahahahahahahaha...



Hahahahahajajaha....



Hahahahahaha keep seeing headline every day, Florida, Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, think couple states. weird thing Europe told wear masks anymore except select places. sat outside restaurant last night put mask go bathroom. waiter stopped told take off! wearing one himself!!! weird. 

Now internal borders reopening time masks rolled back. Seems like recipe disaster me?? too. feel people I'm (Scranton Area) hate reason though. Ive appreciated handling Well... didnt comment no? XD ""OPEN COUNTRY BACK UP!""

OK. Everyone wear mask try keep distance open get pandemic quicker...

""DON'T TREAD ME!!!"" MD areas closing complete streets/blocks converting dining space. pretty damned cool hopefully permanent feature passed.

Sticking head sand saying ""there's options"" rather defeatist lazy attitude. People get fat asses walk blocks. problem everywhere. Governments world place minimal attention educational systems citizens learn think, instead *how* think *proper* argumentation made. Well, I've recently, property state. one's social distancing, yeah hospitals getting full places. communicating field hospitals set places...so partial information shared, continuation mess that's going beginning...do this...no don't...do instead....nope, changed minds, first thing, add thing. Yes sure, also cell immunity, behaves like coronaviruses likely reinfections, like coronaviruses. kid normal sent playing kid house kid sick classic diseases (did work well never got anything way) would immune adults higher risk.
Now might end front judge sure going publicly bashed.

It true definitely disasters kid time none tell father another kid got specific disease younger kid issues immunitary system.

Even seen things still expecting states stay safe side. Lessons held remotely technology today available back then. Yeah, sent bad message. truthful, tell us suffice meantime.

What angers said don’t wear mask, parents 2 boxes masks sitting laundry room, didn’t wear Fauci said no. Thank god didn’t get sick, say they’re angry understatement.

Also, speaking one roommates, conveys idea masks make marginal difference felt fine sending there. Thankfully, studies change roommate’s mind. No. Foreclosures typically wont unless absolute flood near 08 levels. Foreclosed homes usually bought investors anyways banks even often update they're bad shape. Interest rates near zero, everything around actually went price bit. I'm realtor/investor spend free time looking shit. really surprised Maybe size double chin makes lesser two evils cant find exact reference poll questions like 
""Is science disrespectful religion ?"" get close 90% yes conservative Christians.  one denying BLM protests cause spike, sure getting at.

Not sure? sure, Colombo?


When commented, literally one mentioned BLM. one. 


Why think is, smart guy? replace science authority understand message Yeah, yeah, post links expose GDP growth massaging numbers. 

And sure Sweden better countries, neighbors comperable to. 

And Sweden can't scared losing job already lost it!

Yeah, yeah: Swedish officials lying strategy. day, differnt lie. news all, nothing take seriously. there's something COVID spreads different perceived wisdom.

Lol. literally respiratory disease. Masks = less exposure someone's breathing. I'm tired people making like kind super virus anomaly. far proven aggressive strain coronavirus. new virus going huge impact population figure out. Read pledge allegiance...America never democracy... Ah yes can't limit number people building given time. Gotcha. Get ready see variation headline every day foreseeable future. cite basic fact verified google search ""it disproportionately affects black people""

Have personal reaponsibility ffs. job babysit Wearing mask afraid shadow science.

Instead wearing mask. Workout, eat healthy stop smoking much higher chance survive wearing mask.

People dying covid dying fat smokers cant handle flu hearing contradictory, dishonest message directly scientists, filtering major media company? Welp, buckle bo-- oh, sorry. People already saying states, wearing mask might indicate planning voting for. could lead specific targeting person standing line thinks you’re voting candidate.

Oh fuuuck even think Agreed. I'm sorry man. know much sucks. I've got fiancee 2 dogs, kids yet, already feel like I'm abandoning risking everyday. can't even imagine I'd feeling 2 kids relied too. I'm sorry deal this.

I keep hearing people say everyday things reopening ""if scared stay home"" easy. bills gonna stop, I'll lose job, nobody's hiring right now. either wind mountains debt unemployed, risk fiancees lives everyday.

This shit feels like dystopian piece fiction point. hope family stay safe. Nothing love That's crappy situation, darkly funny. Get rid mask orders make legal punch someone face come within 6 feet without mask Gathering inside crowded building vote. Perfect environment Covid transmission. ""Well that's result world-class testing"" - Mike Pence probably...

/s growing awareness, however also push Swedish social media backers Swedish strategy deny happened. 

For instance, though, there's newish documentary made bit splash: major newspapers also written exposées topic. still think level acceptance / knowledge probably low, tbh sure extent public knows now. Sadly downvoted masses. wishing video clip instead tweet.

I think would soothing hear Arnold call ninnies morons. know that's entirely accurate. I'm 39 active runner. caught kicked ass felt like going die several days. struggled lung capacity week afterwards. one worst things I've had. direct effect me. half dozen friends end hospital one died. mom got sick one point dad called us kids told us might lose none us good terms him. talked years he's calling tell us mom might die that's bad was. 100% affect matter fit are. likely another surge coming Amsterdam places result protest Yeah protests eveyone wearing mask. models put millions guess? I'm bit disappointed right now, area live covid-free month, last week got new case able find got it. yesterday got two cases source also unknown. 

And Midsummer, we're doomed get cases. Lol half people dont wear masks first place. rest conditioned lied numb tried tell everyone said governor liar trying cement name president. People believe anything directly face, even face still question it. already explained qualified judge work scientists virologist epidemiologist, sure still aggressively trying make comment research. good scientist knows know, importantly knows know. 

Here several fallacies:

False equivalence 1: newspaper X bad newspaper must also

False equivalence 2: Study X bad study must also.

It lab work direction actual scientist? researcher lab? medical lab? published research research viruses? know plenty people work labs techs, completed advanced studies. would consider knowledge sufficient enough make informed opinion medical study. mentioned: ""There would massive shortages people would buying 50 boxes masks time.""

So talking government fighting masks people, governments? referring say ""people""?

That would make sense excuse lied *other governments* effectiveness masks. Telling ""hey actually work"" hoarding masks themselves.

But thought excuse was, ""we *our citizens* hoarding masks."" Seems like two different things?

Also I'd like restate ""cmiiw"", reddit habit assuming people taking hostile, argumentative tone. I'm not. genuine question. West lying effectiveness masks baffles so. Many colleges planning try tough Thanksgiving send everyone home New Year's order try beat second wave Fall, cases already spiking places may even get chance. pretty stupid rule anyway, need naturalised citizen fair enough, born daft.

So someone born US spent vast majority life elsewhere eligible, someone who's lived country 50+ years citizen almost 40 years isnt. stick gloved finger mouth lick 

Fucking gross, even without ongoing pandemic. turntables... understand saying, sweetie. 

You're wrong. 
You're wrong. 
Simple that. MD: cortisol increases risk death covid. 

Me: stresses out!

MD: don’t stress, die.

Of course going confuse sort re-opening clear. Outside much safer inside.

Well you’re lucky enough one least affected age groups. people really deathly concerned health. *no chance* NYC hit herd immunity. None. Even 20% immune, leaves Err, politicized absolutely happening US. people can't bothered basic things prevent spread. God bless advanced country. Ultimately conversation concluded basically granting equivalent voting trade schools well, lack training uniformity among trades brought issues. one knew enough make suggestions.

The problem lies basically assigning rights citizen based job value provide.d immensely classist inhuman system, basically akin 19th century democracy people terrified letting working peasant class votes, also excuse uninformed. Instead power held within small bourgeoisie voted interest, voted country wars working peasants classes would get killed without ever say war getting fought. Elected representatives represent people, includes non college educated. Curious gives impression anti-intellectualism ""frighteningly widespread college educated circles well"". Also, think common less common non-college educates circles?

Many anti-intellectual movements actually start within Academics among researchers Galileo complexes. doctor starting anti-vax, several geologist climatologst promoting climate change denial instance. pandemic also seen examples doctors claiming responses exaggerated. Academics tendency talk subfields specialize assume know enough (since htey know average person) getting high feeling knowing better. 

More generally, part Academic environment too, I'¨ve met many people viewpoints downright strange. creationists even educated biologists. highly possible people compartmentalize knowledge way - accept science academic rigor specifically study, everything else. 

Overall concede anti-intellectualism widespread outside college educated circles, obvious reasons. distinction college educated college educated. Making distinction dangerous, effectively classicist nothing fan flames anti-intellectualism telling people college educated ""you stupid useless take control life instead you""

The fight accept science - fields, ones actually understand - don't. manage complete academic education don't. mean, sitting outside Marshall’s yesterday 90% people going didn’t wear masks despite large sign stating, “All customers must wear masks times”.  


I think group non-mask wearers far larger realize. Probably right around 40% US population. rest world get contribute? I'd apologize Arizona unfortunately home state full idiots. I'm finally moving planning 2 years. solemnly swear continue wearing mask everywhere I'm going quarantine get NH. So? happens reopen early, set piss poor rules safely reopening barely enforce them. Even then, PPP covers payroll. help rent taxes mortgage payments. Maybe CDC pick fucking side then. virus contagious not? masks needed not? There’s new report every week changing protocol. conspiracy theorist asshole, frustrated American surrounded dishonest sources. God bless advanced country. Actually, fear running masks due everyone going purchasing last properly filtering masks. tell people masks good fighting new virus everyone catching, probably going go buy best mask combat (remember first weeks everyone terrified overbuying).

After initial fear, people could told rational manner masks makes big difference, main issue keeping fluids away people instead filtering. Leave N95 professionals actually need them. Oho! Well that's first time given (what consider be) compliment. Thank rather Finns say: kittos. know, making Trump look bad took along make humanity come together whole... stop reading headlines, actual full length statements usually make sense two weeks ago writing wall Swedish strategy fail continues is. suspect Swedes, shocked news numbers, personally improved social distancing measures. improvements show. end campus wide outbreaks campuses shut again. Either it, go home campus closes. you. whole fucking world experiencing virus. first world country filled fools 1/4 virueses 1/25 world's population
..even though longest time prepare. Well, could continue testing simply stop reporting positives, right? worked Brazil for, what, two days? Didn’t get mad states threatened quarantine New Yorkers? cars NY plates. 
Hypocrite.  statement reporters came contrite comments earlier day Swedish radio said, “I think potential improvement done Sweden, quite clearly.”

Asked country’s high death toll made reconsider unique approach pandemic, Tegnell told Swedish radio, “Yes, absolutely.”

i'm gonna go ahead say wrong.  need mandatory masks, mandatory vaccinations. thinking amazing insights. mistrust people power. something reddit loves context slightly different. ""What's disdain United States Senate? really think know government works better do?"" Like that's point.

And idea language science, *in general* good, abused corporations mislead us make money? Well, long anti-vaxx, that's sounds like healthy skepticism! include mayors too? I'm sure mayor Las Vegas would love aspiring scientist history nerd, issue ""here"" even called United States. Including comrade Correction, *lied* masks. Fauci wanted make sure doctors didnt shortage, told us werent effective.. even bother listening tem anymore they've breen proven lie. think tensions, 4th July going utter shitshow year. really pissed hear Joe Rogan saying masks bitches... Yah even 0.3% 1m people. That’s whole potato famine. haven’t lost many war, would lost Spanish Flu. people acting like it’s big deal. I’ve got coworkers mid late 20s think thing.  Maybe antibodies last 2 weeks like doomers want true That's awesome use technology. wonder though rule people know use technology? Bogus article. report misinformation. Irionic... Everyone wear mask get muh vaccination! assume people won’t cause it’s OC. 

How government remove elected sheriff? can, they? It’s absolutely insane he’s this... even him. It’s like he’s purposely challenging virus. Sweden much showing case. anything, showing 'herd immunity' going work pandemic.

Their all-cause mortality third-lowest 20 years, stands, models showed deaths 15x current rate. check months.

 less serious, serious before. 

Correct, virus changed. understanding has. getting better treating it, objectively less scary March. Back people thought 1 20 people catch would die. No-one knew at-risk age group was. know 1 500 who'll die, they're overwhelmingly old sick - sad, regrettable - people losing months expected lifespans, rather many, many years. Massachusetts back March

[Massachusetts sewage suggests 100K coronavirus cases state: MIT one section Massachusetts could 100,000 coronavirus cases — many times entire state identified point, according MIT-associated study local sewage.

I love band. Oh great. Well, hope don’t fuck food medical supply chain royally that’s probably wishful thinking. unpopular take: US government locked down, despite virus legitimate medical emergency. Hear out:

We knew January latest February highly infectious disease going become globally prominent. way virus, Trump administration (Fauci included) epidemiologists noted, treatment vaccine. Now, best case scenario vaccine rolling Q1 2021. 

With sort KNOWN timeline, needed 1) PPE medical personnel first wave March April, 2) measures people implement longhaul 2021. Back then, secure goal number 1, lied said masks efficacious blocking virus. (Despite noting transmission vectors touching nose mouth...which covered masks). Now, understand need prevent run medical PPE save hospital workers. way restrict sales retailers interim encourage people immediate short-term wear homemade ones. 
Shutting large swaths economy sustainable long-term solution. Universal masking social distancing IS. lying people efficacy masks hitching narrative combating pandemic shutdown itself, US government sowed resentment towards less extreme long-term precautions made people think masking ineffective. something needs universal support affirmation, large contingent US population completely alienated anything restrictions lifted. get ready 10 million US cases come October.

Tl&amp;dr: shoulda encouraged masks beginning instead shutting down. 1 5 kids Boston public school system never even logged E learning spring. Kids need school virus isn’t even dangerous young. flu deadly covid strep throat anything common? white dot throat similar strep I’m calling doctor first thing tomorrow. want prepare worst  nice.

Just one correction, Iceland actually bit poorer America account price differences.

And another reason:

\[\] lying numbers (for Russia/China/Vietnam/etc) three months plenty places title misleading. I've seen article Columbus Dispatch today said biggest spike almost month. Thursday, 700 reported. I'm sure testing available but, still. say surge.. thought guy China. 🙄  personally agree protestors sentiment feel shame saying protest 100% made far worse. combined general reopening time crushed chance anything working. reopening shaky own. cluster fuck California everything power stay open regardless this. go back work next week I’m high risk. excited even though love job. Millions *could* die. based info seen, appears unlikely. impossible, unlikely.

People know *have already* died.

Ultimately, benefit reopening benefits 10s 100s millions (long term) benefit closing impacts fee million short term. value judgment, based information available me, value system. dont agree. age groups less likely getting critical form

But muh vaccination! Welcome 20,000,000 Americans feeling right now. defending excuse, COPD makes feel like unable breathe is, I've heard. imagine wearing mask top lot. also unaddressed problem *biased* science misused tyrannical causes

3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Three months. That's long Americans could stay inside without freaking out. That's could accomplish since one backed up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reopenings abruptly roll back, unless get coordinated mask usage 2-3 months, American social habits prevent us eradicating virus, like countries DOING. 95 percent. Says who? Hope.. last  Right God sad cares entirely assyptomatic. Im really sure protective equipment became stain freedom, believe ... don’t like you. Meanwhile, US miserable. think mean lazy river variety drink float gently river It’s kinda crazy couple months ago, thought people wore masks paranoid. it’s basically norm public. study horribly done. 

They measured antibodies among HCW, excluding confirmed cases. 

Then, assumed 25% HCW infected, got lower antibody results, interpreted mean antibodies lasting.

Pretty garbage analysis, way it'll survive peer review. Anders Tegnell Public Health Agency denied “the Swedish strategy wrong changed. That’s case.""

Next time read link posting...  didn’t fight back We've done treatments, budesonide ventilated patients rest almost covids.

Keep digging, doc. patients got better own. you. Damn! continuous quarantine. look climate change. become completely political often times ignored ""pseudoscience"" right large portion population. covid, science become based aligns politically financially. pretty partisan though certain factions aggressive anti science part political platform. Hell can't stop 30 60 year olds bars. 

At least rural, personal experience. one gives shit ""overblown"" theyre ""counting every death covid cuz get 35k death"". ya go bud, let know need ELI5:
1. readings link many credible scientific studies. Masks, even ones made cloth, help slow spread particulates saliva wearer's mouth talking, sneezing etc.. Realistically, many virus deaths US attributed Trump? mom thinks it’s way half, think it’s less that, maybe somewhere 30-40% range. think deaths go become attributable though. Ok well still even without complete eradication I’d still rather scale polio currently smallpox eradication. I’m saying coronavirus bad smallpox means, it’s quickly becoming much widespread polio NYC yes, rest country currently getting taste now. locked Utah never went 200 cases day....today nearly 500.  Still touching NYC numbers, quickly spiraling control. Lets work sort trade. would love Norway...you place here.  Someone famous said, give liberty give death! Hey mate saw username, here. wishing back home?! lol. Around 100 deaths, 100k. B cell produce antibodies. Idk far Porterville testing anyone wants it. incase ever need test [heres Link.

Amazing.  spray paint assume Fox news convinced something happening Here's hoping! Walmart Lowes morning 50/50 wearing Masks. I'm curious happens people begin transitioning back working offices. weird know? haven’t slightest idea blood type is. one ever handed information. Well yeah, protests duh. Reopening kicks lot people Unemployment choose going back often unsafe work losing income/home/etc. Well ..... that’s nice ..... sigh One metric whether counties kept number new cases reported last 14 days less 25 per 100,000 residents.

San Diego County currently fails test. last two weeks, officials confirmed 2,056 new cases, amounts 62.2 per   Generation? lot 1 generation. Yes. bigger “exploding” hospital admissions ICUs overrun. important part “explosion” happened Italy NYC... NYC would like Italy didn’t short time warning hhahahaha strawman Anyone gat link footage? yeah. handful cases this.

if 3000 new cases.....its hard. beer? don’t believe ever built, say pyramids built Bronze Age. Lost ""claims""... people assumption virus gone almost gone? population San Diego County 3.34 million, allows 835/day - we've averaged 154/day last 14 days. Oh, Florida goddamn shit show.

Anyone lived NYC March April knows virus joke. Seriously, thoughts staffers colleagues.  is, unfortunately, equal opportunity ignorance across political spectrum. It’s biggest disappointment many fellow liberals, even well educated ones. susceptible anyone else. much susceptible anyone else either, kind feeling I've (that impervious whatever reason, early heat bringing vitamin whatever.) words, nothing special Florida, skated may less density places people active, knows. 
Not mention Florida people coming going like many places, moreso least one theme park opening. I'm going upvote you, try read (even though I'm getting hyper critical vibes). fair enough – fixed. 

and humble brag fact data analysis, able identify blood type predisposition 6 weeks media did. link-posting abilities. ☝😀 sure saw Cuomo interview talking might force visitors quarantine...so someone traveling there. LOL! proving point. Fauci's mad ""anti-science'. He's mad people docile sheep. I’m doc Dallas. It’s getting already worse time supposed previous peak hospitals.

I hope not, seems like going really, really bad. That’s way saying, “I’m racist long bring CCP”. Somehow better assume one group *just to* die, better one disagree with?

Yeah.. rekt.. /s Finland

Yeah, going outside telling people need wear mask one city florida... read Ahnold voice American. impossible know, disingenuous start comment thread like death. 50% asymptomatic people lung damage given there's standardized clinical infection path lab, numbers remain outside margins errror. Wow pulled racist card quick lol good Taiwan nothing related China. Outside exceptions like born US territory military base US citizens, need born US natural born citizen. need full fledged citizen they'd said 'citizen' 'natural born citizen.' Indians flooding every social media’s platform. think so, matches science coronavirus coronaviruses we've ever seen short-lived antibodies. think real problem continued effort talk fact current viruses short-lived antibodies people want think means.

I've saying whole time max 3 6 months going x percentage recovered people antibody production that's Corona virus work unsurprisingly one different.

The big question 3 6 months percentage people lost antibodies also immune response people recovered virus lost antibodies still MAYBE improved immune response.

The immune response part theory, short-lived antibodies part alternative viruses like scientific facts base future probabilities scientific fact especially enough time study new virus. protests finished go back complacent wearing mask? sure looked like nobody gave shit weeks. It’s always hige problem, President fans flames anti intellectualism it’s quite worrisome.  saying along. sister works nursing home. shutdowns brutal meant protect most.

She said impossible care residents properly shutdown. family important part care. banned visits. Even windows. family know patient intimately, used guide staff patients couldn’t speak themselves, took responsibility tasks staff would familiar with. banned volunteers coming well minimize contact. staff totally overburdened sudden. 

They also shut activities minimize contact patients. result didn’t even reason get bed anymore. languished final days away. many died knowing wouldn’t ever see loved ones again.

She pushing opening, even though put residents higher risk. said, none make home alive anyways, job give best possible quality life finally pass. shutdown made task impossible. 

If ask would like live lower risk Covid-19 languish away rest life I. Sub standard care, boredom, isolation, risk dying moths earlier new disease, normal life likely able say goodbye loved ones. know would choose, said attitude among residents well, nobody cares opinions, old.

Shutdowns cruel. Human contact critical people’s quality life. shutdown decisions made people don’t know intimate details every corner society operates, people suffer big time. instance, town, liquor store, head shop, considered essential never closed. food bank right next door close. 

Shutdowns cruel. Listen, want great much next guy. lighting ahit fire, smashing windows, ruining businesses, spray painting everything....do stupid things , win stupid prizes. true. people still pretty good wearing masks seen coronavirus stats (cases deaths way down). Floridian Floridians(more boomers tbh trust fund kids) accept Florida lucked first time around stopped wearing masks part town.

Also they'd get offended yo suggested mask them.

I don’t know it’s controversial opinion much better avoiding virus possible. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* problem freaking short-lived antibody problem something I've saying since January I've also saying really need studies determine average antibody lifespan.

So problem assuming actual short-lived antibodies vary significantly person person science points idea get short-lived antibodies wildly person person that's coronavirus work.

In way flu keep coming back recombines genetic material bypass antibody protection Corona viruses also means bypass antibody protection general quality family coronavirus means bypass antibody production simply antibodies body generates effectively left behind infection never lasts long corona virus least none we've seen far.

so, since could read way back January February assumed right point reinfection fairly likely people going get long-term immunity average.

there may also groups people wind antibodies 24 months, measure drop weeks average antibody lifespan unlikely 24 months like estimated never tested SARS virus.

I've basically working idea range antibodies lifespan 6 24 months that's based coronaviruses. Even 24 months people would lose immunity first 4 6 months averages talking about. one starves people death militarily enforced leave home thought Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, guess lot them.

No.. dont think every jackass would right masks werent option. think good chunk would still stay home instructed, whether understood risks not. listen podcast, much particular opinion, fact lot interesting guests long form discussion guests actually able explain positions points views without much interruption manipulation major media outlet, unlike mainstream media - I'm huge Joe fan, although like actually makes concerted effort try understand complex issues, yes he's bit meathead, like forces guests explain positions layman's term understandable people - that's good thing regardless whatever think Joe personally. Ok. gotta take something away that's dangerous causes death, let's outlaw fast food instead? personal cars?

Welcome Greg Abbott’s Texas! Several times Instagram podcast.

Oh man. irritating absolute shit me. handful relatives buying covid conspiracy bullshit, it’s dangerous it’s made doctors said “silenced.” 

“Hear sides, judge yourself!” **Fuck bullshit.** There’s “all sides” it’s problem relevant them. heart problem ask cardiologist (and best one find, that). don’t go ask mechanic weigh opinions equally. legal problem ask lawyer specializes area, don’t ask 14 year old nephew opinion give serious thought. right opinion, **not viewpoints equally valid.** They’re not. thoughts coronavirus simply hold merit experts hold. 

If thousands virologists epidemiologists agreeing point “X” correct, two nobody emergency medicine doctors make video claiming “Y” correct, discredited, disgraced scientist makes video stating “Z” correct, proper way look “yeah let look points view, I’ll decide right.” don’t *get* decide one right. That’s job experts, acquired expertise years hard work dedication specific field, watching low budget “documentary” Facebook. That’s “doing research.” certainly doesn’t hold candle actually earned advanced degrees. 

If you’re smart person, you’re going seek right answers people smarter are.

So mortgage servicer like PHH gets 100 billion payments pay 125 billion guaranteed income investors. people stop paying servicers go default. servicers maybe two months cash hand hand default rates get say 30%.

Now course many investors MBS know risks Credit Default Swaps set ( remember 2008? ). MBS start popping CDS triggered massive scale. 

Now houses corporate bonds. FED first time buying garbage bonds keep corporate backed bond securities ( kinda like mortgage backed securities ) imploding.

But see unlike Obama bailout banks fed got paid back interest banks GM, crap bonds. market gets bad enough crap companies go fed holding hundreds billions worthless paper.

And guarantee wall street Hawks scooping shit debt crap companies, wrapping crappy corporate bonds backed securities convincing feds buy them. believe minks have. remember reading month two ago.

None rights would violated. It’s checkpoint say I’m way work that’s end discussion, nothing.

Meanwhile continued community spread throughout country, you’re ignoring, don’t masks, don’t hospitals, don’t medics.

I’m sure high, trolling, unable grasp reality.

But seriously, border checkpoints useless right now.

And zero ICU’s filling dead bodies, that’s thing.

Having guard enforcing masks good day useless border checkpoints decade. thank amazing state lot that. weeks ago, looking excess deaths state. Washington one maybe dozen looked looked like over-count deaths. fact Washington *only* state found means point moot since everyone else under-counting significantly more.

People, MIL, usually stop listening time make point though. one state it, must be, never mind data contradicts that. extra deaths must people seeking care suicides (incidentally, WA screwing way actually kind disproves last excuse, excess deaths would way WA too; even excess death threshold 6 weeks ago). drunk, denial? that's time give it. exponential growth beast like subtle differences.

That's kind problem.

But thank you, trying part solution appreciate that. That's insulting redditors. I’m asking prison takes care them. 

But bring another point, state required ‘care them’. criminals I’m talking specifically actual scum earth evil. It’s gotta western thing. much individualism?

He's former Governor CA backing current Governor's actions. trying dick. thought already super obvious knew born reading preceding comments.

Basically, understand considering might done better even differently. successful and/or wealthy mean intelligent. don’t think Jordan Peterson valuable voice cultural discourse, haven’t listened Jordan Peterson. disagree many things says, he’s intelligent person presents ideas thought-provoking interesting way. say person planning voting Bernie primaries. possible say:  lots old people listen talk radio telling hoax mask wearers wearing ""mask fear.""

Cuts politics still gets point across. fact issue become politicised whole danger. 'wear mask support one political party' 'don't wear mask support one'. situations wearing certain types mask necessary others different types mask, mask all, appropriate approach. politicians (nor supporters) good taking moderate, rational, middle ground approach. help stoke division pushes people extremes. is. Arnold backs shut fuck wear bitches! perfectly honest though, terrible idea. Effectively would mean tradespeople non-college degree holders become work horse class influence society. ""You class stupid, work, make money me, shut up.""

Also ignores anti-intellectualism also frighteningly widespread college educated circles well. might downvoted merely anti-intellectualism, also legitimately terrible idea. Maybe organize ""Hug European"" campaign every major Chinese city prevent racism.

/s Ironic considering large portion population fucking stupid.

'Merica *cough* Fuck *cough* Yeah! IMO consideration particular needs investigated promptly via rigorous practice comparative imagery (fell ICU stress period) autopsies patients recovered COVID-19 died causes.

So much rides assumption asymptomatic = damage, simply know that's case. Inflammation happens reason. asymptomatic cases result poor clearance, systemic spread high viral load result poor immune response? Symptoms might negligible short term, chronic disease lungs, liver, kidneys, heart lungs could result.

The increased rate strokes among asymptomatic patients incredibly worrying regard. believing numbers covid ""related"" deaths hard.  know story two stored male genitals but, wtf.

Issuing order wear mask nothing politics. People busy reconstructing seriously damaged economy, navigating fallout (social dislocation, poverty, geopolitical tensions...) mourning lifes losts. Perhaps many wondering ahead, since mild virus caused shitshow abyssmal collective response many places, expect greater incomming challenges like climate change?  first going met huge backlash. Probably protests possibly happening.  I've watched multiple debates featuring Shapiro idea OP talking about. anything, opposite - Shapiro tends talk extremely fast speaks absolutes order **seem** intelligent like authority, actually blows smoke outta ass give anything says even modicum thought. Respect freedom say wish. Fuck prisoners. feel bad innocent ones believe me, choices got em there. Scum society shouldn’t anyone’s respect they’ve clearly earned it. someone works covid ward.... way would go movie pandemic without p100 respirator full face shield.  Even everyone wears mask, idiots taking face eat popcorn. user name says all. Never, ever go lockdown junk. I’ve watching crowds disobeying Covid rules weeks protests. government praised protesters spreading Rona saying we’re gonna die again. I'd take chances coronavirus tbh Yeah I've enjoying lately wearing camo hat work boots along mask go groceries, staring directly eyes everyone see wearing mask they're fucking bitch who's afraid LOOK like manly they're insecure fuck.   C’MAAAAHN WEAH MASK NAOWW claim black people care COVID, neither articles support claim.

Your claim bullshit, whining I'm expecting prove it. 

Okay Karen. Yup probably got grounded though..

Doubt it. dad twitter exactly like little prick. Shit apple fall far shit tree, basically landed right base. makes think they've peaked? Nobody wearing masks we're still looking exponential growth. 0-44 overwhelmingly comorbidities 

Particularly 0-35 part spread fast far much mutating occur. activist. terrorist. He’s idiot. Social distancing masks stop 100% transmissions, stop lot it. Along smart employment, good public information, cleaning shared spaces, hope reduce transmission bunch. people still get get sick. need number people less max capacity hospital. Sure!

In summer hot people also spending time indoors AC... virus spread easily. still wrong recommending masks, never said covid-19 can't transmit human human, perhaps show evidence that? January 6th already issued warning covid-19 high possibility transmit human human based history corona viruses, H2H still yet confirmed. 

On January 22nd, confirmed human human transmission based confirmation China. way tell true statistics. Everything I’ve found says Russia half million cases. almost many tests us. I’m wondering that’s possible. People still aren’t gonna go theaters. Well educated people least. So...but...they still selling popcorn slushees so... Oh agreed there. great mild asymptomatic cases vast majority makes getting much easier. Unfortunately many people casts wide net tougher cases. definitely managing healthcare system seems like alright time. Tiny-minded spite-minded little dictators... true AZ. was, might recently changed. blame Texas Arizona states seeing rising cases Florida deserves special acknowledgement. Governor went victory tour, Pence, telling media apologize getting wrong. mistakes made, doubt, information still spotty. Learn history doomed repeat it. case, history 3 months ago. Could classified terrorist that? kind poetic justice makes smile. Today learned word 'asinine"". think word applicable two people. Either give drugs taking could see world different angle. I've seen term ""patients"" used quite often....especially TV bottom screen scrolls.

Further investigation....if one bothers to....reveals point....they ""cases"".

Patient used denote ""hospitalized."" Loophole never done drugtest? leaves believe screening people based ethnicity appearance. know one persons slided through.. 5-6 people piss once. find trace anything.. get help. false? 10% serious case Covid-19. could push numbers to, say, 1% 2% virolated people, could control Covid-19 without need paralyzing economy.

Also, possible might virolated way? Like, guy deliver things home, could infected spread viruses onto things. took things home got viruses process, enough make sick him.

I real dumb asking, really know. death toll Sweden.

Which experience exponential spread. cares? conservative ""activist?"" 

don't usually oppose things main thing? actually want days, except people things? No, never wear one driving. leave car put on. go drive thrus much less general CityMD free, dont know test (for accuracy). Asshole make literally everything him. depends entirely are.

If live cold area, summer great outdoor gatherings winter not. live hot area, winter great outdoor gatherings summer not.

In United States, spring coronavirus exploded WA, MI, NY, NJ, MA. summer, northern people outdoors southern people indoors AC blasting. explains FL, TX, AZ 1st wave now. people symptoms really going getting tested? epidemiologist making knowingly false statements general public masks patronizing view public ""can't handle truth."" 

It would've better silent masks. No, went complete opposite told public *wrong* thing.

Let's put way: Fauci tell people today wear masks, he'd absolutely roasted. Even said preserve masks first responders. People would say advise people make masks. eventually happened.

So get pass? PPE shortages anyway FEMA, states, everyone else engaging hoarding. 

But instead focusing facts issues, dont back indignant verb choices. Masks protect OTHERS might accidentally breath moisture droplets on, ninja sneezes. a-hole. get airport security

No. Chinese scientists found bat coronavirus that's 96% full genome match SARS-CoV-2. cave bats found also 1,000 km away Wuhan.

I think likely scenario animal human transmission happened way earlier think, less contagious pathogenic form evading detection. time around mid-November virus mutated contagious form, regarded common ancestor known strains SARS-CoV-2, caused outbreak Wuhan. can't find original Italian study. would interesting see genetic sequence sewer strain. Anyone saw huge crowds protests without single mask anywhere see coming moron. IFR less 1% reputable sources. Saying 5% symptomatic people die correct. sure upvoted. saying NYC takes masks seriously? Puhahahahaha even live NYC??? Maybe now's time add FAR like added smoking Thankfully flying AA anytime soon. **The bet:** lock 96,000 deaths. take bet.

**Also Sweden:** 5,000 deaths. 3rd lowest all-cause mortality rate 20 years. says he’s still bed Trump.

He doesn’t give fuck. beg disagree sir, ignoring science well covid pandemic started frank also gives us another data point. Hopefully due Flu cases younger people see many deaths hostipalizations compared older places hit. realize get virus get permanent lock logic.

Source? don’t know you’re sarcastic there’s absolutely chance deaths anywhere near zero August. number cases risen past two weeks, deaths lag. We’ll probably still seeing 500 deaths day August projections line well.  subway open. 800,000 people rode one day last week.

We’re supposed go large gatherings global respiratory virus pandemic. Worst Governor EVER. sure people think heat eliminate virus


Because temperature may important consequences way virus spreads. Time survival surfaces, air humidity, mention few. Let alone warmer weather drive people open air therefore less exposure stagnant office air.

That said, temperature unlikely eliminate virus whatever rate optimistic figure w.r.t. coming winter.  let know i've wrote stuff keeps censored read it. actually let real conversation pc one Look Yuri Bezmenov.

Governors orders. basically close parts hospital kept crafting ICU Covid units. bring HVAC engineer negative pressure patients rooms. takes time.

 cancel elective procedures save PPE reduce ICU census. even then, smaller hospitals keep kept asking transfer sick Covid patients. Ok fine going transfer patients? EMTs get paid $15/he going take patient ambulance helicopter risks exposing like 10 hospital staff prepare move patient medically fragile difficulty breathing. 

My brother works ICU make difficult decisions accept patients not, based sick were. hospitals *supposedly large* expand enough tried transfer patients outside hospital system, leading rather intense phone conversations ""dumping"" patients hospitals prepared better. fucking nightmare. believe ""we capacity"" hype. gap closed days.

One thing hear doctors hard hit areas is, ""Where stroke patients, heart attacks? Everyone coming Covid."" heart attack patients staying home? staying home want go hospital? secondary deaths. Tertiary deaths people get screened cancers marginally bad cases turn terminal cases. 

This hype. happens fast *even decide lock down* least three weeks sustained growth nothing about, people already infected, already occurred. That's happened us Chicago. locked see decreases FOUR WEEKS hard lock down. decreases cases dress four weeks. Hard lock down. idea would happen went Full Sweden exponential growth dense city non-Swedes. People poor health, essential workers live near poverty multi generational homes. confident huge hospital system. Transferring patients state easy task people die way get turned transfers. 

Stay home possible who! No, you’re idiot. country ( italy ) remember brief period t-shirts seat belts printed became popular cause could elude autovelox cops wearing those. Yeah guess we'll wait ""real"" one development.

I’m choral singer, months (minor) cough easily triggered deep breathing, wondered would affect singing (were choir ever resume).

I also acid reflux issues, years (very much exasperated weight), assumed weird cough (acid reflux), really wonder Covid.

I don’t cough now, last 3 weeks. weight gotten bit *worse* since lockdown (still pretty much locked DC), acid reflux time, you’d think it’d worse (but isn’t).

DC got Covid antibody-testing, really wonder reliable is, since I’ve heard many stories bad antibody testing (generally).

I would really like get antibody-test point. used think maybe 20%(?) chance might already Covid, early (late Feb, early March), really don’t know. Fuck ‘em Yes lied left everyone sitting ducks scrambling amass supply masks. we’re going pretend didn’t happen. Can’t living dystopian world ya know.

I'd say authorities everything could undermine legitimacy healthcare workers. Oh, weird letter signed thousands healthcare professionals saying protesting important lockdowns. probably China reacted like week Beijing. Watch ... copy want shit control.

I agree, different (personal) invalidated theory top politics

I find extremely hard believe whatever strains caused much disruption presently ones countries like Spain, France Italy ''detecting'' Late December Mid January samples.

Why?

Well, earth virus managed skip South East Asia, South Asia active Christmas tourism season, without causing noticeable toll health systems **before** Europe's situation quickly deteriorated seems good true.

I'm inclined believe species jump happened lot earlier think even necessarily Wuhan. Enough time managed spread around multiple countries unnoticed. Already here, going hard verify really came from.

At point mutates aggressive strain Wuhan, rest history.

The reason personal take considered 'original' strain ago, even common strain Wuhan. ''original'' strain actually linked Guangdong; yet Guangdong become New York neither Hong Kong. hell supposed believe anything multiple states acting dodgy reporting cases place? course there’s surge cry “but increased testing!!!1!1!1”  cant even

I started make progress anecdote heuristics referring back later. Example book Second Thought Wray Herbert. Starts avalanche Feb 1995 Utah. Experienced skiiers made poor choices there. researcher looked statistics avalanches found many patterns several poor choices made experienced skiiers. report called Evidence Heuristic Traps Recreational Avalanche Accidents, Ian McCammon explains trap familiarity, consistency, acceptance, among others.

I explained person basic terms people familiarity terrain since successfully many times past assumed time would safe. saw people also caused believe would safe. agreed skiers crazy dangerous conditions.

Later on, brought topic saying something like crazy thing read afternoon? started giving examples times people followed social behavior. able think examples too. 

I really thought convinced them, discuss reopenings part it, next day realized convincing unsuccessful still fall trap believing popular news sources instead scientific sites. That's saying all. saying protesters taking necessary precautions. take note Midwest states deal anything, it’s probably reported. Assuming % still low sad either way. masks give healthcare workers “confidence”. Great. Impressive. science. impressive, especially placebo effect kicks link shared seem indicate that. tests take week come back, would never setting record highs day announced. make sense.

I know report cases based onset symptoms testing date, data constantly shows 7-14 days decreasing positive tests. know states this. don’t convince people calling stupid instead explaining they’re wrong.  issue many interstate cases since time. seems unlikely would upheld today environment PA saw 526.

If so, that’s crazy COVID made political Trump it’s used foreign countries divide US response. They’re trying get upvotes suggesting wear mask. know isn't. moral issue

Why trying way? That's literally said right here.

Remember diamond princess trip happened end January early February? Four people 700 infected still listed serious condition. last death ship recorded middle April, nearly three months cruise began. insane long takes people. isn’t going lot morale. Everyone know military regretting life choices moment. Haha...something like that. vibe judgemental people I've never met ever, particularly time going great distress. even speculating this. literally matter personal preference would since thankfully situation. assume knows husband well enough know comfortable with? nasty comment, completely needlessly. seen numbers also see death count. Look Russia death count 8k 500k infection. Even double still much less compare say Brazil. seems like either counting totally different something right times change.

Back March everyone seemed angry [young adults partying Spring 

Now nothing. protesters mainly age vulnerable virus' worst outcomes. Old white guys grievance vulnerable poetic sense. Even accepting point, one uses patients describe sick people well enough stay home convalesce bedroom (still ""sick person"" patient). word (in context) literally means person actively receiving medical treatment.

That said, ""median age Floridians recently diagnosed 37"" would accurate headline. And, actually, that's kind good news. means fewer people going end hospital dead median age were, say, 57. AA flight I’m happy they’re making everyone wear masks.. stop booking middle seats? 5 hour flight NY CA packed wall wall makes masks aren’t much. could smell scent woman squished me.

Surely? Avoiding shithole country see. guy go fuck himself. dad used plane least per week work, company likely going force since can't travel risk getting ill/spreading virus. 

Assfucks like Straka putting people like parents health risk, hurting entire economy letting virus continue spread.

 hope someone kneecaps asshole. Even two broken legs he'll still wear mask. auto mod ridiculous Yet another surprising reason unconscious incapacitated people routinely pursuing airline travel. IQ myth, see closer relationship authoritarian people think wearing masks lowering ""freedom"" points.  Sweden's economy hurt, I'm guessing every country's economy must hit hard harder. Yep. got me.

But compare west.

Try see whether factory worker get decent life wage get.

Sweden didn't.

Interpret whichever way wish. Either lying coronavirus bad claimed. Either way arent going lockdown again, people die wish countries virus control would allow workers enter.

There thousands us awful stuck away work long. stranded away families kids. Others newly married planned wedding. There's even story 2 parents stuck abroad away kids.

I'm talking Vietnam, I'm sure countries similar. Vietnam 14 day quarantine entering still banning workers diplomats highly skilled. help. considerable amount air travels sides top.  opinion ""Corona hoax, need masks, reopening ASAP"" opinion, wrong. 

Stop letting people get away shitty views ""I entitled opinion"" topic opinions. Especially family.  wild understand community infection mitigation works. 

Sweden nanny state, many years. Personal responsibility horrible excuse inaction government Thank support! I’m guessing may reinfected since it’s since I’ve last sick. recovered first time, took 2-3 weeks recover smell taste don’t think would normal fine go bizarre unless got sick Georgia one first open. daily cases steadily trending since.

I don’t think enforce mask wearing there. anyone confirm agree initial comments? know sub existed! I’ve subbed now, appears already posted Plateuaed would appropriated term. Check 7 day average graphs see: plateau reached 3 weeks ago deaths 2 weeks ago overall cases. Yeah, racist baiting keep seeing sub. talk bars opening, parties inside, etc? No, clearly issue people caring civil rights. Unreal... absolutely expected. man narcissist, everything him. People wearing masks him. really believes this.  understand colonialism led outcome?

It possible Puerto Rico colonize itself. colonized. forcing unemployed...? Michael Osterholm podcast. He’s epidemiology expert. podcast far entertaining, wouldn’t get near hair place doesn’t masks. me, I’m cutting hair. I’m willing risk it. I’m epidemiologist, Osterholm is. aerosol scientist staff. kind science people understand it. zero evidence “made home” masks anything. every reason believe larger droplets carry virus. shield might help that. there’s strong evidence thing aerosolized. case, shield literally nothing. I'm glad mentioned percent positives increasing. many people fall victim 'half truth whole lie' method covid propaganda believe cases really getting worse, we're testing more. real truth percentage positive also increasing. People really need hear know whole story. Boo-urns? gonna take offense anyone lazy write word “you’re” Either CNN headline writer read article intentionally misleading. 

It's CASES PATIENTS. CASES minor even asymptomatic. However PATIENTS poorly.

I'm fully support taking many precautions keep front getting spreading virus, bad reporting help. purpose. bought ticket got kicked plane precisely purpose. need support. don’t blame her. one else update condition. Fucking morons deserve it. fight Freedom course, health risk. mean cloth like fabric  well, yeah. Oh sure sorry animosity. heard many braindead takes ""guess saved, hurr durr, bootstraps"" completely miss situation. like 20%

#ONLY means they'll get first. current strategy herd immunity. Everyone get it. Come Governator!!!! Sweden flattened curve high level weird reason never know was...

Might slow react thus quite spread capital implemented measures managed flatten curve, compared countries faster react thus flattened earlier stage? 

Nah, would make much sense. clear: teletherapy effective helpful me, however, still want go back person meetings, found little helpful comforting Again, said actually read comment understand that. open week though saying either side right one testing March hours footage seen, protestors wearing masks demographic public. saying good thing, observation likely huge protest spike instead large reopen spike. We're getting herd immunity immunity coronaviruses last long whole planet taking turns getting it, going waves waves, could get regular boosters would get herd immunity levels (about 70% virus, far). Maybe actually read comment linked moron someone disregard health others. care health least care people That's proof. That's countries tracing *apps*. Denmark app, rely old school ""shoe leather"" method epidemiologists think better app, need app compliment. 

So keep trying. Well better treat right now. hey every day halloween. thing conspiracies though tons real, proven conspiracies. think dangerous spread false conspiracies, also bad try paint conspiracies false. important people learn real nefarious things powerful people plan position power. 

Teaching people conspiracies never happen powerful people never bad things never abuse power exactly allows things, go uninvestigated people turn blind eye. There's middle ground found believing baseless conspiracy theories also believing conspiracies never happen. extreme sides coin ultimately harmful. Conspiracy mean ridiculous baseless theory, means people conspiring nefarious things secret. Youre wtong, neither I. saw *was* dying, werent bothered Swedish youths all. Plus, added plus lowered social security burden. know true. Arnie's man live tell restrictions lifted shit ton people partying boats town restaurants. least third people maskless public anyways. Give couple weeks part true. least Pinellas Hillborough counties. Anyone go get tested, referral symptoms necessary. Excellent coding. Someone needs immortalize using emoticons. company (a large US multi state employer) reopened offices 3 weeks ago. Employees high risk groups continue allowed work home virus threat mitigated. rest employees shift rotations 50% building occupied time masks required worn desk. common areas limits, including meeting rooms. many states masks optional (like Minnesota) spiking cases? understand totally! going baseball year, take bank. Might well wait spring next year! Go on, crappy reason going roll out. Sweden PeRsOnAl ReSpOnSiBiLiTy? one many others?

Maybe figure wait 96,000 deaths predicted... fuck off, baseless assumption getting old real Ur moron think death rate actually 5.4   need shut everything. careful, universal masks, etc allows lots economic activity. Currently living Orlando I’m shitting pants. It’s spiked much “testing”. work public before, didn’t come across hear cases close. area, we’ve 8 patrons call sick, employee. mention hotspot numbers city. average age new infection FL counties around 29. young people getting don’t die chalked “HiDinG NumBerS!” actually know good scientific data uninsured populations.  [List countries - answer question. keep pretending Europe rolled extensive TTI programs know that's case? tend lag behind. Anecdotally, local hospital started see increase hospitalizations. happen again. Use existing public health laws cease dumpsters harming others. That's exactly to. Its...boring. 

I virus Feb lasted turned crazy bad ear infection. Part hopes covid tell dial fear, part knows probably unlikely. Oh yes. Korea superior.

Knock top notch analysis fella predicting 23,000 daily deaths👍  got excited learn new, neat sounding Italian/Latin word. disappointed. No, not. Outdoor transmission rate massively lower people wearing masks. issue people going restaurants, parties, etc inside refusing wear masks. embarrassing. hate :( leads? Don’t mean leashes? OP changed it, headline says cases CNN changed No-one's quite accepted average age dying older actual life expectancy.

As much hard handle modern society, people die ... something? Wow water wet! I'm freedom. free kill yourself, kill others process. mean honestly 2.5x much worse consider fallout worldwide lockdowns. ~1 million dead worldwide, even ended 5 million dead worldwide, would hard argue worse price lockdowns, expected kill many millions worldwide, including hundreds thousands children more.

I think bot malfunctioning u/ActuallyNiceOnTheWeb, replying wrong comment. Haha worries. Florida thread. one says one life doesn’t matter everything relation affects lives. saving one life means taking away livelihood millions families allowing work, may best “sacrifice” life millions families don’t suffer. cases, taking away livelihood well worth one life depending severely everyone surrounding issue affected. Sometimes moral dilemma saving 10 lives vs saving 10000 lives. course 10 lives matter grand scheme things value lives saving option. doesn’t trading 10 lives 10000 lives though, could stopping tens thousands going homeless drug addiction catch minuscule number people dying year something related issue. absolutely certain people country certainly believe similarly whenever refute caring 1% (which frankly quite large population 300 million people US). though Saint. transferred sickness himself. sacrificed life them. actual fuck...This dudes serious trouble real soon. That’s clear threat direct loss due decisions preemptively protect themselves. pos jacknob don’t worry all, absolutely fine. Working well Spain, 90% wearing voluntarily anyway. Well, fair, specifically tried say masks “spread infection” sorts nonsensical garbage. told truth, probably would less mess now. Wow... frankly despicable People thought would die summer sharpest knives drawer given Australia summer months ago virus started spreading there. decent interviewer it’s long form interview gets good guests

I think Tim Ferris much better, even though interviews centred around self-development I’m cop strong conservative portion CA. It’s reddest get.

I’m thinking difference must least watch news isn’t special channel crazy people. Could crossed months ago given Australia summer virus first started spreading there. much different churches agreed, frankly N95s overkill unless you’re specifically working environments known Covid-19 vectors, like hospitals. Ordinary cloth masks fine rest us. Hell, that’s reason government said buy N95s insstead use cloth masks beginning, reason go interpreted “no masks ever!” let That’s crazy fukin stat work restaurant also protesting lot. 
I feel much safer protests.

Non-medical grade masks barely protect anyone virus. head RIVM (Dutch health organization) actually calls political measure, wearing masks. might even worse wearing mask, causes people touch face gives fake sense security. Barely anyone wears mask Netherlands seems like getting virus control. 

The whole mask thing creates ""us vs them"" scenario, demonizing people wear one. guess polarization society US speciality. saying. Weak- willed. People living fucking rainbow factory last 75 years. Look history human beings, constant fucking battle LIFE, hard back breaking labor, poverty, death, war, list goes on. People, American's definitely even know fuck favorite restaurant closes.

People care cushy lifestyle material goods health well others, even family. embarrassing sacks spineless shit.

Put fucking mask on, wash hands, stay home, shut fuck up. that's precisely problem. make mandatory people it. Germany first said please people made mandatory.

On serious note, imagine trying claim unemployment adult entertainer probably difficult. need answer but: enforce it? like saying ""don shoot may harm you."" country also lot people follow rules general follow them.

In news, U.S. spends average 2 billion dollars day defense. No. Paper masks fall apart water. Unless adding 200 beds day keep growing hospitalization figure that's pointless stat need understand numbers reading.

There's already 120 thousand people dead US already flimsy mitigation techniques, less 5% population infected.

Before virus stops spreading, need infect around 70% population. math, 120 \* 70/5 = 1680 thousand dead, 1.5 million dead, close number 2.3 mil. dead circumstances. Later says number decreased factor 10 good mitigation suppression measures taken. 

He's wrong. actual scientific paper problem, know read interpret results, think everybody's idiot. IIRC 8 US states (probably more) CDC caught doctoring public numbers.  days ago Fauci admitted intentionally lying public back Feb/Mar/Apr wear masks. I’m fucked.

I work home, wife physician it’s matter time.

Our community denial. Bars, churches, restaurants packed. PPE stores aren’t nearly built enough, hospital isn’t built handle coming wave.

We plans isolate one kids rooms separate entrance private bathroom, ordered window AC unit practically seal part house. Also plans place getting food taking care laundry.

But fear impact many dead patients mental health impact CoVID19 families physical health.

She’s strong lady known plenty death throughout medical school, residency, fellowship, CoVID19 cases seem really bring ton death certificates that’s going tough anyone. Maybe they'll get baked country flagged in.... Panama, Barbados, asked Liberia. Another new high Arizona part country still believes thunder causes sour milk. think change hoax inevitable. US decided give damn. Reporting results study fearmongering. things work. Relaxing precautions hella slowly though. won’t able eat inside restaurant least another 2 weeks, won’t able go venue like concert hall another month. Yeah, I'm hoping deaths lower better treatment, vulnerable people know deadly hopefully protecting more. time AZ FL admit made mistake go back lockdown. 

Letting people die ego deplorable. States revenue prevent that. state needs either contain individually, 30% population get evicted, continue surely-not-legal-to-do-indefinitely banning evictions. overgeneralize, ADA requires “reasonable accommodation”, don’t think demonstrated didn’t could airlines do, know fact not, comes air filtration?  “The best example think Bill alcoholic job driving heavy machinery. Unpaid time treatment reasonable accommodation. Permission drive drunk unreasonable accommodation.”

This. good. love add ""Conservative"" there, like liberal would ever wear mask.  “Can’t y’all die peacefully go target?” That’s guy. It’s murder it’s genocide. Wake up. stated dont think it’s good idea all. civil war south doesn’t play football. 

To much money line pro football universities budgets collapse without CFB like referring Jacob Wohl investigator. think ADA puts restrictions someone can't ask. Like call airline tell need wheelchair I'm sure legally require medical documentation says need wheelchair details need wheelchair. right ADA apply person disabled first place think businesses hands kind tied establishing that. That's false dilemma. never two choices. Many countries lock opening fairly safely. Heck, South Korea even lock down. 

Mask use massive testing/tracing allow low spread virus mostly open economy. really way, economies trouble long time safe go businesses. POS, tried lie medical condition wear one. would need see stats health complications. I've seen lot news stories trumpeting seem outlier cases, but, honest, concern seem way people who've already decided want believe looking fallback given fatality stats clearly nowhere near bad said be.

Though, honestly, believe federal government ""zero response"" pretty clear camp in. decided believe want believe there's clearly nothing could say would make think otherwise. also type people attend either. Many friends protesting isolating families, carrying tons sanitizer, 14 day quarantine afterward etc. \*sure\* folks bars that. stupidity.

This mass murder  Hey wait, guy spelled 'Labor' funny.

INTERLOPER! want antidepressant Sweden. go Two drugtest piss cup showing dont smoke Weed anything illegal. do, treat anxiety 

To everyone reading: obviously everyone wants antidepressants, SSRIs prescribed pretty much everyone wants them. true restrictive attitude towards forms drugs, cannabis included. air becomes incredibly difficulty enforce. risk making matter worse belligerent passenger. Someone getting worked screaming going spread whatever even more. cabin wide announcements work, would honestly think better wait disembark, issue ban passenger follow directions. New Tory slogan: Calm dear, commercial Honestly doesn’t anything... work, coworkers constantly masks off, around chin, nose. Recently got photographed audit corporate, took pictures employees store cameras, sent pictures departments managers enforce proper way wear mask. What’s bad even managers shit too. follow example employers leading horrible example begin with? employers selective customers aren’t allowed wear masks. always someone posted front door stop customers coming without masks on, let it’s nose. people wear walk store take they’re middle store. stuck working customers this, also coworkers team. seen upset everyone got corporate sent pictures everyone store. Wait thought that’s invalid racist document? Make mind yes oldest trick book point poorest people ignore rich powerful making like bandits .


To bad theres certain group get rhetoric.  sinus infection ear infection. painful symptoms months. Viruses like that. Even rich donates good cause, there's pretty low possibility donation reach actual poors. 

Majority upper/middle class already donated PM cares fund CM fund. stopage poverty related deaths corona age. Yeah, way wash dishes. realize soap rinses right? remember people accused trying build herd immunity like, ""I know talking about?""

fyi, longer takes build herd immunity, super wealthy inheritors participate building herd immunity. Interesting though it’s mostly “all lives matter” counter protesters don’t wear masks though...  Back day could say thing smoking flight inflight smoking ban taken place. could even claim nicotine addiction medical condition. ""I best fk rest"" attitude. Ok prosecuting one cop likely would’ve prosecuted anyway worth reviving virus kill thousands innocent people? you’re willing let people die Chauvin get sentence would’ve likely gotten anyway admit that. video went viral going jail. anything protests amped charge increased possibility gets acquitted. Again, people fighting good necessary cause doesn’t mean they’re right way. Hmm wonder men getting affected women. read book recently called “Your Brain Birth Control” author talks cortisol levels women birth control nearly non-existent. brain thinks you’re stressed you’re actually producing hormone anymore. Maybe butchering something like that, lol.  That’s good point. Though believe we’re far animals think. Humanity empathy every human regardless actions. don’t agree that. California good first, point it’s fatigue crazies. I’m Orange County crazy people without masks scary. health director got death threats trying impose mask rule. board supervisors interim health director hacks go mask individual responsibility law. say people responsible enough. Mask dumbest thing argue about. don’t leadership level. political hacks wanting offend loud mob. Blaming sides really convenient them. Even though power ones put incompetent fool charge. keep telling everyone ""it's ok! ok! wear mask!"". Wonder 2nd wave coming. Taze fucks Nobody right mind would open sports, fans stands. assured way transmit virus sit next people screaming yelling three hours. 

The Trump rally bad idea, it’s one event. Well, he’s supposedly half dozen them. That’s hell lot different 16 NFL stadiums putting 70,000 seats 16 weeks straight. mention dozens filled college stadiums. Could be? could day find million dollars.

Jesus Christ dumbest fucking thing conservative ever said *and they've saying decades*.! comes pass post infection immunity lasts months subsequent infections outcomes far dire outcomes, citizenry US big trouble (as rest world).

Source: pure paranoid doomsday conjecture stemming chronic case self-inflicted “could things *possibly* get worse?”. no, internal infection, similar humans asymptomatic.  still blows away 2020 pro-virus activists. like ""anyone disagrees science moron""

Which true. joke, people planning mass protests next Sunday Netherlands, believe government open everything back up. done well bring numbers down, think over. places reopened month. Stop fear mongering. yet death increase nationwide. Cases staying deaths keep dropping. guys keep talking death spike moving goalpost farther going happen. Set remind come back admit wrong mid July. body always works. COVID specific. New York hit 3k new cases 3/20. Two weeks later 4/3 hit 10k new cases day.

Remindme! 2 weeks

Did follow pattern NY? It’s 3 days since found outbreaks Texas see happens. I’m saying doesn’t look good consider football close contact lot different people. You’re putting players families risk believe players gonna ones dictate happens. could read first 2 sentences article. 12k But... would piss moan internet??? Ah yes, major outbreaks going north. That's perfect time FHM go summer holiday. FFS. Yeah. Unfortunately conspiracy theories often less substance fitting group. 

A comedian said something along lines crazy person every small town everybpdy knew able handle one them. 

The internet connected small town numbskulls. they're legion nutters reinforcing others ideas rest us keep ignoring part we're used dismissing harmless. 

The really scary part bad actors found group ripe radicalization. Theyre easy slowly indoctrinate already live fact free bubble (anti vax &amp; flat earthers example) live reality accustomed dismissing rants idiotic unhelpful see peers (and people unconditionally accepted them) continually push radical ideas upon them. 

Eventually see respected friend group acting unison fear becoming outcast adopt radical views.

Another great example every single doomsday cult claimed prayers saved world predictions dont come true. Cults gonna cult 🤷‍♂️


Thank coming ted talk. Banning someone return flight would fucking evil haha fully support though refund Nah &lt;- believes happens ""think"" happen. idea happy comment made feel😂 never involved greek life honestly think kind stuff would go away frats abolished? Sexual abuse, drug abuse? No, college kids would still stuff wouldn’t guise fraternities. It’s especially ridiculous pretend could ever end underage binge drinking country drinking age 21. let 18 year olds drink bars ffs, would probably end lot toxic party culture. think would cakewalk, like GWB 9/11, Trump moment unite country. Unlike GW, failed spectacularly. could encouraged mask wearing, hell--he could sold MAGA masks made money encouraging cohesive, unified response. Instead, turned virus political litmus test. economy hurting nothing show except divisiveness lot dead people. That’s it’s looking like look mask-wearing countries remained functioning hospitals never becoming overwhelmed. America seems ignorant put mask. Everyone would it. Or, know, wear mask public easy thing Sure. cousin coming Florida next week business matters. travels going Utah Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, last stop house fl. Kind getting nervous coming ive good dont want bring covid. Good. shouldn’t snot politics, select individuals spare powers made way OMG. can't believe America think first. much bluer. AZ gonna 2 Democratic Senators, fucking weird point keep virus spreading. incubation period 2 weeks, meaning could spreading even know it. That's need wear masks, sick not. don’t wish many people get dick cancer that’s type guy usually makes list. 

Fucking awful photoshop text stock photo Latinos must brought illness China Europe... 🤣

Probably ski trips northern italy sure make political/partisan situation. us broken lock rules precautions somewhat ignored. Rather brief interaction, BBQ, party, protest etc. together. Nature supercedes social constructions including politics, government, religion. God speed all..

*Reporting Florida* Good fuck douche won’t mass tourism quite lol.

Even Oxfords September claims hit mass vaccination mid fall, still don’t think see mass international travel atleast another year.

Like GFs cousin supposed get married India traditional Indian wedding (I.e. days long fucking massive), December 2021, don’t know GFs brothers GF allowed go sure trigger lot snowflakes see Nice little chart, worth bookmarking IMO. wouldn’t surprised states less mask compliance whole. excuses protesters wearing them. 100% wearing masks. think masks never became popular lot states California. find positivity rate? can’t seem find type data making headlines. caused evil whites? Redneck even uses anymore .. it’s racist like calling someone nixxer....u must kid someone us... anyone wear mask? would guess no. OK chance serious, I'll play along.


The protestors knowingly chose protest without mask. knew risk anyway. Passengers airplane choose whether get seated next somebody wearing mask.

 protestor feels uncomfortable next somebody wearing mask, they're free walk away protest elsewhere feel safe. Someone assigned seat next Mr. Individual Freedoms choice. [Does testing explain case doesnt mean people gonna wear bars going enforce GOOD Apparently Dream City megachurch - capacity 20k. really truly becoming death cult. can't dead severely ill either customers dead severely ill. really biggest threat face pandemic. leadership surprisingly competent comparison. certainly perfect though, want public inquiries failure stop spread LTC centres (and terrible period), mishandling pandemic stockpile left us without critical PPE, mishandling early response pandemic (we basically ignored pandemic playbook month half least). corona wearing mask cough mask standing next you, also wearing mask chances catching corona decreased. mother ICU nurse Boston almost cases recorded people contracted virus admit taking mask precautions catching it. says many nursing homes patients weren’t even given masks. saying masks 100% effective decrease chances contracting also taking social distance safegaurds ""I travel time""

Not anymore, douche.  people want actual info this: 

Governor Ducey finally yielded power cities enforce mandatory masks. Ducey also showed wearing mask one first times (maybe first time) ever. 180 he's stood since re-opening. He's toed around mask wearing saying recommended never gave cities power enforcement. finally cities announced mandated masks. 

Now see people follow along continue defiance. Sounds like you’re dealing lots snowflakes. wasn’t serious matter, irony would overwhelming. Europe East Asia eliminated virus. course conservative outlets going make manbaby’s political leaning fact chose ignore safety regulations put place e keep people safe. concerning animal shelters several cities emptied quarrantine started, everyone started adopting them. . . . Hospital let visit family member matter what. I'm LA. I'm disgusted country. willful ignorance insane.   sincerely hope goes without hitch one gets infected.

... enjoy schadenfreude doesn't. Yeah, protests, riots, presidential rally going keep numbers high. fact summer also means people outdoors mingling ,too, means exposures going vastly greater. pretty much accepted way beat virus exposed it, suffer it, recover form immunity it. Many die this, epidemics always happened. long number deaths stays low doesnt start mutating, think .05% mortality going accepted norm year two. least viable cure made.

Well, yes. That's [redacted]. [redacted] [redacted].

People: Maybe airlines could part upgrade planes sanitary.

Airlines: Spend...money? Yes happening eyes. Wake up! worse protests happening make video upload youtube? like see becomes difficult enforce land plane refund everyone connecting flights, kicking maskless off, people get message. 

There exceptions tiny children disabled elderly honeslyz pilot power. I’m working. make less working. make month making week unemployment. get risk life. Yay. stock market rich steal poor. Every time take billions market lowers 401k leaving money retirement. It’s rigged game. None even exists. awful wearing mask fucking PANDEMIC become political divide America. blame Trump anyone else.

Even Trump told cult wear masks, would save lives dozens Americans - minimum. supporters people would infect too. give two shits America supporters would rather see die wear fucking mask public. True, LA good it, ones watched various live streams weeks ago Minneapolis different Texas streams, tons tons without masks. Hint Hint..... Pete Ricketts. OOOphfff. Deaths lag way behind cases. There's surge cases lately. Expect see deaths pick soon.  


As August prediction, dreaming. Oh. Deaths trailing indicator, since lag time new case death weeks (sometimes months). Cases today, mean deaths July. follow numbers here: comparing small island nation United States shows touch reality are. 

Because order chance success strategy tank tourist industry causing far harm virus ever presented. Bars, resturants, casinos, indoor venues highest risk place. think Japanese study estimated one 18 times likely contract covid19 indoors outdoors. 

Still least risk keep distance even doors mask up. IMO ever much better mildly uncomfortable mask feeling like lungs filled hot lead two weeks worse. Well seeing increase due protests already, not.

The sudden increase states opened already regardless warnings. That's problem--it's either take care health eating salads prepared, buy bunch ingredients, make salad exactly once, time motivation eat salad.

I wish different. hate using plastic. eat healthy first. Maybe one day I'll graduate preparing own. comment history nothing trashing protests reduces actual transmission 10% increases risk transmission 900%. I'd rather see 10 people grocery shopping masks 90 people shopping *with* masks. It’s simple question. someone else’s health concern me? think mean Jared. makes absolutely sense, actually opposite. people infected, chance mutation.  People won’t go shutdowns.

We talking disease kills you, big “if” considering 99 percent people survive it, number improving get better treating it, kills older average age likely die simply obesity, almost half Americans least do. doesn’t dis-able majority adult life like obesity does. campaign normalize obesity everyone seems onboard with.

Driving well, killed people worldwide Covid-19 still, likely year well, nobody seems willing shut avoid risk either! fact us seem quite content assume risk even trivial purposes, like getting ice cream. driving many orders magnitude deadly covid-19 consider average living days stolen victims considering average age Covid-19 death 78-81. Still nobody would willing shut driving avoid deaths. Sorry news? Like anyone expecting anything else?

This virus minimum 2 weeks incubation time...so obviously nothing immediately noticeable happen spring break #BLM protest...
But afterwards? course spikes.
I'm smartest wealthiest.
But someone please make notice people use common sense here. political statement. /s Brandon Straka , walking, talking national liability. living time right thing save lives rules goes official declaration. Virginia British colony Britain. also didn’t accept fact British colony, hence revolutionary war. 

You’re seriously arguing semantics it’s making sense. Even *were* right, means would’ve wait 35 years founding America first president. number exception rule.  make big deal something prove yourself, stop lazy research ""New cases, deaths continue slow along hospitalizations..."" 211 new cases reported 5 deaths.  even read article? impossible slow down, requires diligence. Something people selfishly refuse do. Glad agree, whatever reason downvoted hell simply stating obvious. people don’t want pay outrages fee see movie sit 2 hours mask on. pain, I’ll wait till hits Netflix. Gotta whiplash change. 

It's political statement wear mask. literally life death. 

This conspiracy, mask close proximity people, keep socially distant, protect others. also rules airline employees ask questions relating directly passengers' disability. would need self-identify disability airline. impression mostly old people. people Florida live 40? Florida Man's Run. I’ve actually heard argument “first starts face masks, ends women wearing burkas” Guess what. He's black, brown, woman. Positive test rate also going up. increased testing case. Hospitalizations also up. signs need know cases increasing, deaths follow. Please, per capita still doesn’t mean “the majority” cases coming southern az said. Sure, maybe there’s per capita southern AZ, immensely populous Phoenix area far driving cases even lower cases per capita. It’s pretty simple. Majority cases reason case count climbing Maricopa county. can't cure stupidity Ok but... least wear mask? Err towards stuff stay outside rather swarmed together buildings?

Does lighting spoil milk?

The conventional answer “no”. based 1913 experiment “simulating lightning” lab comparing milk struck “lightning” not. found differences. attribute milk spoilage heat humidity cause thunderstorms form low pressure found thunderstorm.

&amp;#x200B;

However, observation thunderstorm turn milk sour recorded far back 1685, eyewitness accounts even today specific enough exclude heat humidity (and probably low pressure) hypothesis. leads one believe something this.

&amp;#x200B;

In case, pasteurization refrigeration seems prevent happening. modern accounts dairy farmers affected milk yet sent pasteurization. little recent interest researching whether occurs, and, does, does.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would lightning spoil milk?

&amp;#x200B;

Still, pre-1913 theories, updated today’s science still contenders.

&amp;#x200B;

One theory proposed 1891 ozone created lightning, encountering milk, causes rapid oxidation and, therefore, souring. variation ozone helps multiply bacteria cause normal souring, making milk sour faster.

Another theory, proposed 1890, bacteria actually fall clouds rain, make way milk. fact, much later, 2011 2013 research proved bacteria actually live clouds fall rain thunderstorm. connection spoiling milk investigated.

The situation different Soviet Union. Despite claimed milk pasteurized, still spoiled similar way unpasteurized milk. Presumably, this, research issue continued there. explanation offered prestigious scientist book published 1964. Like ozone explanation above, argued microbes responsible effect. simplified version explanation published 1997 issue New Scientist:

&amp;#x200B;

“Electrostatic fields within certain range break emulsions polarising droplets causing coalesce head tail. build-up lightning discharge, field strength presumably pass range may cause exposed milk separate aqueous fatty components. Milk metal container would shielded field remain emulsified.” Dude, 7 posts minutes topic? Love it! Sure, pandemic don’t either. point is, good luck getting millions flock back movie theaters. obviously won’t going awhile. activism come, believe, call ""thoughtaction"", neither simply thought simply action (as either either simply first place...) must coupled explicit, thematic substantive general cause nonviolence/nonharm, yielding ""nonviolence/nonharm thoughtaction"". science, although requires special kind thinking work fundamentally, part ongoing progression. explain anyone interested. head too. Dang miss going street side schnellimbiss Brats beer yum. also breaded pork sandwiches awesome!

I trying find video story crowded canteen, saw group people eating looked like staged video?

Show link gun shot wound listed Covid. 

The questionable one I've seen alcohol poisoning Covid death certificate, even then, alcohol poisoning kills slowing breathing, Covid respiratory, I'm willing believe doctor sans Covid, alcohol poisoning would've recoverable. 

There root it. find aneurysm rupture kill tomorrow, run hospital get hit bus, bus killed you, matter 23 hours left live, bus still killed you. sick, bad things going health, die Covid, still died Covid. Concessions half daily revenue (sometimes so!)

No theater open without selling Stop it.

We evidence masses 30 years old going hospital COVID insurance.

And even assuming thing, percentage population insurance small - 8.5% nationally. Even assume twice 0-44 cohort, that's still 17% population without insurance.

There's even less reason believe 80+% population insurance going hospital we've seen almost casualties age group.

Try again. Proud Finn here. article weird... agree things going ok now. still share similiar problems countries. masks imported shady things going behind scenes (turns chinese quality). Head Epidemiologist closure schools mention conference coughing sneezing over, people turned away testing sometimes, airport temp screening, big disagreements budget revival economy BLM protest (Im hoping protestors mask &amp; distance little yknow? Nothing else).

Id argue trust authorities crumbling poop show deal early stages pandemic (then things arent relevant pandemic). good things contact tracing giving quarantine orders also quarantine whole state Uusimaa. mention natural gift social distancing.

''Highly educated proud'' confusing part tbh.... show supporters political parties gives feeling ''the supporters parties highly educated''\*köh köh\* ''center party'' \*köh köh\* supposed mean people like lawyers, officials proud finnish?? dunnut gedid. 

I'd give article decent rating. Shouldve cleared things maybe added things. Domestic terrorist Virginia British born... American American... saying Roman’s Spanish cause conquered Iberia later became Spain? Fun fact: 
Not DeSantis blame testing also blamed hispanics senior high school flying back New York School trip. TSA agent’s computer tested positive explosives...proceeded put airport lockdown patted searched stuff. Maricopa hardly driver compared southern az. Yuma highest case per capita state cities can't dismiss race issues class issues. effectively ignoring them.

Your 3rd sentence entirely baseless goes science shows black people less trust medicine scientists general Yes ask it, explicit protections information can't used protestors. blame anyone protests wary admitting government officials, necessary information need know. risk large outdoor public gatherings minimal precautions like masks, even minimal social distancing huge implications ability ease restrictions. bad wish anti-maskers anti-social distancers get COVID? That's said, wanted ban flights countries terroristic threat. fact groundwork started Obama administration.

You probably lay Fox news first good thing done American Airlines workers surprised talk TSA early goings. TSA large useless needs disbanded. ever scenario could prove worth, it. infrastructure personnel PPE testing front, still could done lot agency resources possibly slowed outright contained initial spread. 

Instead, another demonstration uselessness agency disbanded. Thanks. see available discretion Dr, healthcare provider, urgent care center. Interested knowing meets criteria.

I another instance guy said take shoes another tsa agent yelled taking shoes. like 🤷🏼‍♂️ proud it, coofer.  data clear main factor limiting spread masks. poor decisions calling lack preparation masks lack mandating them. lockdown vs non-lockdown argument red herring. listen science? \*BRING DEAD\* Except one wearing masks stupid simply different opinion, flat wrong lie. waste time trying convince someone listen reason? God damn stupid. One genuinely gets systemic issue individual issue (as long individuals actively stupid)-

**OK answer question here. 

This source covid tracking project uses: take new cases (3246) divide new tests today (15031) get **positivity rate 21.5%**

So think thats right answer here.

**********EDIT. I've noticed Arizona's numbers ""New tests today"" ""New PCR tests today"" match other. Covid Tracking Project says may putting PCR Antibody tests together. 

If new cases (3246) divide new PCR tests today (12476) get **positivity rate 26.0%** ""Conservative activist""

I feel bad migrant workers, well sane, lockdown-abiding people live Florida. None deserve this.  Nope. feeling airline succumbed mob mentality, which, feel, happening place country right feel

This fucking guy ""feelings"" Ontario, testing average around 28,000 people per day gotten 200 positives day province 15 million people. includes city Toronto 3rd populous city North America population 5.5 million.

I work hospital COVID testing centre well, people coming symptoms less disappeared. mainly testing asymptomatic people want test reassured may contact someone, need tested go back work visit elderly family. Hell, get ugly looks wearing one. Work requires nowhere else. Karens shitting diapers nationwide! OMG, feelings!

But cop gets killed scumbag, that’s part job, right?

Grow already. one goes hospital day test positive. usually go home ride out, symptoms become severe enough go hospital. 4) States like Florida misclassifying deaths merely ""pneumonia."" actually throw Florida's completely unrelated /s pneumonia deaths (as well states fudging numbers), think see death rate nearly rosy looks. makes wonder hell ancestors leaving Finland. hope visit pandemic behind us moment sooner. significance 1-3 million? Waiting executive order incoming forcing stores stay open agree, lying implies intelligent enough know truth could never accuse people like cousin that. NJ think given point wound less 100 patients? One definitely got dismantled early sent southern part state. also closed entirely mid-March mandatory masking public soon after, essentially barely needed them, best case scenario.

If respiratory problem Covid could death sentence Florida then?  public health perspective asymptomatic / symptomatic really make difference frats boys responsible citizens...TOGA PARTY!

Animal House ensues. Lol page right GOP handbook. Trump usual took lead minions follow thousands people suffer consequences. I'm Philippines well.

What area in?

I usually live Beijing work since pandemic I've Philippines. I'm worried country predominantly poor prevents proper lockdown quarantine people can't afford that.

How holding up? Yes probably realizing wrong thing do. Anything clicks guess.

I haven’t seen boys story anywhere else. Hi Also, protesters, depending state wearing masks outside well. excess mortality charts i've seen far wich probably reliable datas subject suggest widely underreported, average around 25% higher Remind 2 weeks. Yes. American abroad embarrassing. read comment can't seem find I'm probably missing something said. think changing definition word conspiracy. conspiracy stop conspiracy stops secret. Cointelpro still definition conspiracy. guess could say conspiracy rather conspiracy since happened long time ago that's kind arguing semantics. people talking things like Cointelpro they're still correct calling conspiracy since definition one. There's legal definition say something longer conspiracy secret anymore.

But, coverage purposes determined US, considered uninsured. sure cops better things mask police

Pretty sure don't. Hospitalizations lagging, wait week two. I’ll never forget months spent Koh Samui, Pha Ngan, Tao. It’s amazing beaches, great diving fun people. 

Or least 1996. Trump hour ago Tulsa's Mayor lifted curfew event. numbers linked articles cumulative totals, since March whenever started testing, cumulative % positive tests AZ since March might 7-9%. current daily tests 26% positive day's tests, much better indicator current state virus spread. surprised articles written way intentionally, mask severity spread make look like positive % rate better shit show actually right now.

Edit: 2nd link actually say % positive last two weeks, fact today's tests 26% shows thing gone rails:

""Of PCR samples collected week processed, 18% come back positive. figure pandemic-high 15% last week."" can’t sell shit beer Right. article said. 57 hour lockdown next two  virus never going away, it? Grove Street. Home. 'Least befo went away fucked everthang Oh, agree protests increasing spread, I’m assuming protesters think protest worth small chance permanent disability dying over. feel like 2021 really scared of. way treating 2020... think people thought infectious contain maintain normal life. Basically couldn’t put lid back on. Sweden “As long don’t overrun hospitals might well move forward instead stringing out. end every country death, we’re gonna faster rate.”

But it’s pretty evident keep relatively contained continue semblance normalcy there’s vaccine better treatment. means lives saved long run. Sweden’s miscalculation. US well. absolutely false. Uninsured persons COVID-19 needing hospital admission required law admitted hospital treated time longer require lifesaving care.

I never said this. once. welcome obsessively comb every statement I've made confirm this. find it. there. never said it. 

But I'm glad wasted time soapboxing irrelevant point one made. say sarcastically. 

As someone works health care industry, specifically hospital, I'm aware laws surrounding right emergent care. mention emergency treatment irrelevant point I'm making. 

Again, welcome go back reread exchange. 

I said adequate knowledge co-morbidities uninsured populations 0-44.

And I'm still right this. Uninsured people less likely go doctors data collected later used medical research.

And, I'm honest, rarely take annual blood work children outside hospitalizations. many diseases begin children manifest adulthood routine screening populations all.

Uninsured folks *might* know untreated hypertension diabetes. *might* know dangerously high cholesterol. might stopped BP machine Walmart might run family suspect it. 

However, time, discover BP, A1C, cholesterol routine annual screenings which, again, many uninsured people receive. Therefore, many uninsured people know sure commodities medical research modeling based limited data. 

If lack treatment progresses, patient may end hospital everyone already agrees they're entitled emergent care. 

However, again, takes awhile go onset hospitalization. likely see type hospital data, account one fucking knows I'm still right this, length time onset hospitalization. 

We know, high degree certainty, healthy uninsured populations US. Especially chronically uninsured populations. Further, statistics across world borne younger populations significantly (even exponentially) less likely elderly.

The world countries guarantee right routine preventative medical screenings? world largely higher safety standards? world lower obesity rates? 

By realize dangers taking worldwide data applying uninsured US populations I'm glad we've talk. Claims contrary irresponsible degrade public trust.

Which stop. Doing. That. mean sure. might make sense technically. positive test rate compared previously? almost guarantee significant rise we're seeing cases protests. know metro area almost one protesting wearing masks we've seen drastic rise cases lately. making light protesting maybe better way protest right hundreds thousands people gathering tight groups virtually PPE. Maybe virtual protests? know. Chad Phi Beta Delta Kappa goes kiss granny bingo hall must drunk ignorant US politics dude getting downvoted like crazy really don’t understand Guess I’m moron! Finn I'd proud every day, culture/language/history/country awesome!  got knocked ass January. Coughing fits, fever, body aches. got antibody test yesterday anxiously awaiting results. originally thought headline said: ""Carnival sell sex cruise ships b-"" (wtf?!?!) Waiting days getting tested probably wiser. takes three days infection levels high enough reliably show tests. *Have* open full capacity? Why, someone pointing gun heads?

Maybe time let businesses fail time, operate full capacity high risk way middle pandemic, let businesses better suited current situation thrive.

Might sound little callous, can't prop corpse dead business forever. unlikely enough people feel safe going places ensure get 100% pre-pandemic business (maybe short-term since lockdown lifted people wanting take risks awhile, long-term).

Assuming could give adequate federal aid people, course. know current systems poorly equipped handle this, wife trying unsuccessfully talk human unemployment weeks now, barely hanging job convention industry, company said expecting revenue rest 2020, basically they'll gone 9 months without revenue point, guarantee they'll see revenue next year either.

That's kind point. company, that's making zero revenue 9 months plus, propped supported keep going *maybe* pandemic ends point? Currently owners companies shifting money around, things keep getting cancelled well 2021, might eventually pull plug that.

We support people affected businesses figure new way make living. gets point past pandemic, new venues businesses industry open up, open fact new pandemic well could happen suddenly future sort way protect possible scenario, probably open first place.

I understand one really thinking could possibility, except scientists warning decades. There's excuse next time. much $$$ line play. Money beat health concerns. Nope, 30 posts day Fl Az. Uh rah ... freedoms ... choose deaths. like 25 days since protests began dude lmao cost massively fucking lung capacity endurance.

Per CDC 8 10 recover within days like cold. plan putting long possible personally  there's kind trip involves going eyeball company's offices inspect manufacturing / logistics. kind needs done person, though trustable services existed (for example, sending third party auditors), I'd pay that.

Making sure information getting non-english speakers crucial. believe done Trump ""like"" masks, everyone else extra obsessed them. takes 10 minutes get enough viral load, 100% virus killed 6 minutes .

You’re simple minded internet troll tried get last word failed. place see every state's numbers?

What Wyoming Idaho look like? bad argument. People reject anything that's new uncomfortable. People wearing pants, clothes, long time. 

The argument masks really wearing 10 mins grocery shopping, wearing hours time recreational activities. People want soon enough. wear hours job tells to. Nobody office unless they're working within 3 feet somebody else. yet news agencies reporting increased spread higher death toll? Plus, local news several states reporting ICU beds nearly capacity. isn’t time another lockdown, point lockdown first place? Legit question, known non bias news source pay for? honestly don’t trust anything anymore, would pay 100% neutral journalism. amount random guessing make less wrong instance 👎🏻 really arriving southern US now. New cases good metric, look positivity rate combination number tests hospitalizations. Lots states seeing higher positivity despite increase testing. need actual increase underlying prevalence explain combination, constant decreasing prevalence positivity rate drops expand testing. Hospitalizations also looking good. still lot questions ability asymptomatic person infect others. Ive also read paper saying many people dont even produce anti-bodies, bodies fight virus even gets point. One thing sure, theres lot still need learn. Sorry Americans stopped eating junk wouldn’t get virus Covid. Oranges, sunshine, exercise. sick get? That’ll tell answer question Lol ain’t wearing mask, sorry. hospitals nearest exceptions dying, visitors could come many want long visitors running fever coughing heads wash glassware prep samples feel comfortable claiming know scientists PhDs. must testing shit outta people according gov. cities like NYC, Philly, Boston, etc short term pain creating long term stability businesses. Say reports several hospitals Florida reached capacity get fired hospitals...people going shut economy people go out...not enough keep businesses afloat. hits society bad people stop going work. cities governors know way get economies back create stability businesses confidently hire others back re-invest projects without worry sea-saw open/abrupt close cycle. businesses populations feel confident, spend money long term, take loans, invest, etc. right businesses don’t know shut tomorrow people hoarding paychecks certainty anything. legitimate medical condition masks concern, wouldn’t also prevent public pandemic? OK there's lot dangerous misinformation unpack comment... idea 1:1 prevention death related mask apparel is, best, misleading. 

I never said 1:1 death prevention. However, wearing mask makes %70 less likely transmit virus, %25 less likely breathe virus particles given person. two people wear masks, transmission chance 1.5%. reason important many cases asymptomatic, incubation period 14 days, meaning lot time individual spread virus people realize it. 

 reduction chance spread, there's evidence support wearing mask 'saves lives'. 

This common sense. everyone reduces chance spread virus, number daily infections goes down, exponential growth slowed. leads less deaths, simple fact cases directly proportional deaths. look literally every country besides US. morons politicizing wearing masks, countries able reopen due cases declining. vast majority people hospitalized killed COVID 19 elderly pre-existing conditions, like compromised immune system. 

Why matter? virus still already caused almost 500000 deaths happened otherwise. say threat people die selfish ridiculous. quite make sense mandate mask wearing come contact come contact high risk groups 

This education important. blows mind can't grasp concept exponential growth. fact, actually lead protection vulnerable groups creating herd immunity. get 'herd immunity' no-no term sub.

You seem know herd immunity means. Herd immunity last resort methods fail, cases growing high slow conventional methods. try stop then? rest world control, cases still skyrocketing. 

For telling people wear masks ""propaganda"", would need ulterior political motive involved getting people wear masks. Calling propaganda absurd, people like dangerous. Sorry guy, amount name calling going collapse wave form. celebrities brave make controversial statements really take stance like that, stake position everyone else agrees with. don’t even get politics, know are. gf went beach Trump country wearing masks amount triggered dirty looks insane would cost $40 buy lettuces field greens $5 tub organic spring mix. would go bad I’d way could use week. point states control like Michigan (thank goodness), NY Illinois mandate 14-day quarantines ban flights to/from Florida. know nothing ever stays same, change constant. choice. Either make changes improve USA allow things deteriorate system breaks (which getting pretty close doing) build new system. lead direction paths different. think people would normally choose first path less violence, chaos, loss life. people hard time accepting change, ride system ground experience second option. really us. we're almost july, people sick since March/april getting tested coming positive? 

Makes sense.. also good PR AA. “Activist” people charge big problems Long time I've boosters legit sources. Russian government would never post blatant lies propaganda.  Unfortunately, link appears longer working I’m taking post down. incredible. Cases surging plan. Full steam ahead. Calling now. Cuomo announce quarantine FL travelers NY today. Welcome new age. Everyone something highly attention-grabbing ""activist."" Everyone cell phone ""journalist."" Hotels getting mix. Ritz Carlton bought smaller ships repurposed recently. 

Disney can't fit people want sail them. Think get three separate doses. Illinois get another MMR shot able attend state university....this 1990's. makes say that? reported another 3,822 cases COVID-19 Friday morning, breaking one-day record 3,207 set 24 hours earlier.  89,748 total confirmed cases 3,104 deaths associated COVID-19, according latest data released **health department**. That's exactly study posted less day ago. Plus, there's little evidence paper. Pointing stupid fixes stupid decent chunk time. Tell them; learn. Public health requires public trust. That's reality. Lying mask efficacy damaged that. America's strain anti-iintellectualism since founding. know nothing party 1850s comes mind. That's nothing new public health leaders known better. takes one small seed doubt, people anti-science agenda completely exploit it. hit 19 wisdom kicks usually disclose info employee tells media. No.

There isn't.

Sweden 505 deaths/million inhabitants. That's among worst globe. first. What's point self-disclosing there's nothing back up? think people need sort documentation falls apart. number medical conditions prevent wearing mask must serious vanishingly small, think would much burden. Anyone level disability probably spends lot time seeing doctors. rules constitution. Also, great logic saying immigrants = racism. Yep, virus also due man's hubris. lot diseases get encroaching places man left mark yet. could also infected asymptomatic, therefore going get tested looks like 1 infected.

What happen weeks asymptomatic people infect older people people compromised immune systems show symptoms?

I guess wait see... I'm absolutely disgusted way state responded pandemic. government (state local) along citizens demonstrated gross lack common sense beginning whole fiasco. someone high risk underlying health issues family members also high risk, sickens every time step public place still see people without PPE all. NONE. things witnessing Facebook absolutely atrocious. People throwing parties sake making political stand social distancing orders. Talking ""their rights"" violated able gather large groups. cringe worthy disheartening closed Facebook down. People would act foolish face global pandemic understand could inadvertently killing another human exposing deadly virus someone want friend. internet otherwise. astounding prevalent attitude risk group highest well. realize could possibly happen get illness? :( Nursing homes assisted living same, then. counting deaths people stay assisted living aka long term care facilities long time. always called nursing homes though. Yea track Well know that. Thank you. Excerpt:  

 

Sweden, [stands apart instituted mandatory lockdown measures, ranks fifth world terms Covid-19 deaths proportion population, 5,041 people succumbed disease Thursday.

Around half dead nursing-home residents, proportion roughly line European countries U.S. Older people around world proven vulnerable new coronavirus.

At start pandemic, Swedish medical authorities issued voluntary guidelines outlining prioritize patients, suggesting doctors assess patient’s so-called biological age, weighing overall health prospects recovery, making treatment decisions.

Doctors overseeing nursing-home care advised keep distance residents infection risks told carefully weigh condition patients referring hospitals, said Thomas Linden, chief medical officer Sweden’s National Board Health Welfare. 
.....

Eighty-nine percent people died Covid-19 Sweden 70 years older 

....

 

In Sweden, critics say, guidelines often resulted older patients denied treatment, even hospitals operating capacity. Occupancy country’s intensive-care units, instance, yet exceed 80%, according government officials.

Compounding problem, relatives doctors complain, fact people nursing homes often treated doctors don’t visit person.

About 90% nursing-home residents succumbed Covid-19 Sweden never admitted hospital, according official estimates. June 15, according National Board Health Welfare, 5,426 nursing-home residents tested positive virus, 58% still alive. Officials caution numbers estimates, since Covid-19 sufferers nursing homes diagnosed disease.

In Sweden, average 21% patients intensive care 70 older period February early June. compares 49% period Denmark. proportion older patients ICUs started rise recently, according Swedish Intensive Care Registry, become clear hospitals aren’t overwhelmed.

Although Finns probably used Swedes behaving badly now, good let frustration then. Thanks submission! However, already top sub [this Reposts removed This. laws pulling pants public merely makes us feel uncomfortable see someone's pee pee dangling. public health benefit prohibiting type behavior yet require groin coverings. case COVID _is_ actual health benefit. can't please require while? Well. LOT morons. like education. western assets? Usually flagged odd places like Tonga crap keep taxes down. plan reckless. far unspoken Trump strategy racing towards herd immunity. 

For long time Sweden showed similar numbers neighbors Denmark Norway, locked early

But Sweden’s cases continued grow deaths, two Nordic countries really put lid I'd surprised ever get level prolonged period, all. There's finite number people infected eventually, it'll go down. they're essentially (and somewhat unintentionally) opposite ""flattening curve"". numbers going spike sharply eventually drop faster areas. run risk healthcare system collapse happens quickly. That's actual lockdowns instead half-assing it. 4,100 Texas yesterday yo! option. americans twisted concept freedom. also cannot expect people right thing. Right rip barbers cutting hair fevers. 

National lockdown solution issue US implemented. Watch recent video. Weinstein guy kind served Covid masks receptive criticism.

At least he's smart enough know dumb sometimes. Norway 244 deaths. Sweden 5,053.

45/million inhabitants vs. 505/million.

Sweden horror story. escalating. Cities North overrun infections moment. getting better. It’s absurd demand proof something’s nonexistence there’s proof existence first place. 

This commonly accepted notion math, philosophy sciences general case: still need proof something true even proof true. seems likely P != NP, proof confirm it, proof says otherwise. We'd like proof all, can't say case one formed. literal democracy would mean every citizen age would required meet Washington Congress does.

If can't trust people money, would believe trust enact sound economic policies? know enough economics make decisions it. think plenty Americans want admit they're qualified make opinions things like that, else twitter much garbage. never claimed Nature study flawed. claimed entirely separate study published MedXRIV.org flawed.

Can guys please stop downvoting every comment make thread? It’s getting really exhausting. I’m literally getting downvoted said Nature paper completely valid comment. Yup make like checking ID bar. People given wrist band something showing tested day. Indeed, thats I'm saying pretty good! That's bold move Cotton... post Twitter said unfortunately him, someone recorded actual conversation lying ...

Wow, must embarrassing you. I’d agree comment worry come across parroting something told. 🤷🏼‍♂️ blaming new yorkers march Antibodies don’t fully reflect immunity. It’s T-Cells.

FB lit Finns complaing study POSSIBLY true. many comments like ""pfft happiest country? must've gotten reversed: we're depressed country"". amazing. adore Finns biting self-criticism! also reminds health-related reddit sub, always contain unusually bad cases worst case scenarios.

Not saying dont believe people still symptoms months. think rare, there's probably story lot cases (such covid exacerbating underlying health conditions person wasnt aware had). know world impacted covid19, might time USA ask aid countries. Especially since capable taking care ourselves. 1 infected know of.

How many never tested? want brandon LGBT community. LOL. mods 1000th repost? guess like fear inspiring stuff? race issue class. Black people inherently prone dying Covid they're black.

If everyone equal economically blacks dying higher rate, therefore, class issue. ""If stop testing pregnancy right now, we'd pregnancies, any"" - president usa use quarantine sick ramps back up.. Yup. Dunno monthly UBI hard people understand situation like this. Masks work. Six feet distance works better. Handwashing works best
What research done arrive conclusion? Oh see, thanks clearing up. thought talking density population. 100 percent protesters wearing mask? even find photo 10 percent wearing mask lol two different issues. understand things work States. okay. New Records!

Wonder FL run brown people blame on.

And news flash, testing isn’t much. conversation came work covid existing air. Long story short re-emphasize it’s mainly transmitted aerosol spray like coughing sneezing. Now, instead social distancing wearing mask, coworker sprays Lysol EVERYWHERE. place reaks gross ass chemical scent. 

I think I’m going lose mind fucking stupid everyone is. Like two simple ways safe side stepped idiots, opt something worse like spraying spray could potentially irritate people sinuses lungs. 

I blame management requiring masks even discussion this. 

What spraying Lysol going It’s horrifying knowing many Americans simply don’t care lives health fellow Americans. can’t imagine living place. Swedish culture natural tendency distance. mean gonna happen. Live move on. wear mask stupid. worry it, literally typo Something I’ve thinking while: could act designating COVID-19 pandemic increased mortality rate disease? ""I'm sorry like like wearing mask"" 


\-Brandon Straka, face American selfishness last week, state-licensed child care centers longer required comply list safety precautions effect since mid-April. means centers decide want check staff temperatures, require parents drop children outside stop serving family-style meals, according notice state Health Human Services number open child care centers slowly grown last month, 10,925 May 12,172 beginning week. slow reopening also prompted increase number caregivers young children reported contracting COVID-19.

But states opened, parents return work lose everything. choose children providing children. also pushups, sit ups, dips pullups (the latter two using chairs whatever support weight)

Do enough keep shape. like ""I used squat 3 plates reps"" shape gain 30 lbs daily uber eats either. country failing us. heard Desantis planning opening schools fall Florida well. I'm last year high school there's way I'm going live high risk individuals die virus. 

Sure affect kids... schools probably among worst places go time. really hope something worked soon. People better stay r/coronavirus then. seeing hospitalization numbers? don’t see article.

I really don’t understand everyone keeps yelling case numbers, qualifying means relative death rate, hospitalizations, test rate. IMO, simply tracking positives meaningless non actionable practical sense.

Given already know majority people positive asymptomatic mild, talking positive cases says nothing matters most—who dying where?

I walk around mask daily, refrain pretty much communal activities. Haven’t seen family another city since started. I’m trying responsible here.

But see leading news case numbers. aren’t leading deaths hospitalization? got it. economy can't survive without know. thing people tend skip over, economies better dealt pandemic. propaganda country lead everyone believe even possible, yet see is. lot people talk ass, probably work restaurant industry, reopening (on Long Island) customers wearing masks. Understandably, owner well restaurant owners, responsible this. could keep it? excited business again, don’t want deal customers bitching wear masks. I’m pissed because, sure, customer don’t want wear one fu*k allll coworkers bc right wear it? I’m sick people mean, I'm public health expert, minimum seems following: 
1. Mandate mask wearing. End politicization this- absurd dangerous. 
2. Watch reproductive rate. things start spiking up, start roll back loosening restrictions. I'm worried FL state late may require another hard lockdown- fuck, need start something. 
3. Shut large public gatherings. There's reason theme parks need open. 
4. Broaden social safety net need keep people home work, feel hopeless risk losing homes. 
 
There's likely more, come mind. \- judging description, would say western assets signficant extent, limited tax optimization. get bought e.g. Saudis Chinese, extent Western ownership influence fall zero. applies suffering sectors. makes think temporary natonalization would better solution making available anyone money. laissez-faire people capital nationality think history world, modern ancient, shows opposite true.

Truly glorious discourse Parks, yes since ample room distancing. Well, that’s good news crowd adamantly proclaim children spread Covid based one tiny study Iceland. science, social science- room argument.

This right here, things said, bullshit.

It absolutely science.

Yes, social science surety branches science. 2 + 2 = 4 absolute, social science deals people, absolutes.

Society, laws, culture infinitely complicated 2 + 2 = 4.

Which even important **randos** street butt opinions think qualifies good research not. 

You fields. scan abstract Mathematics papers think found valid criticism. that, actively standing way scientific social progress. 

Knock off.  

Why this? 2011, scientists study on.

* [**Wishful Thinking: Belief, Desire, Motivated Evaluation Scientific Anthony Bastardi, Eric Luis Uhlmann, Lee Ross

In it, found people biased interpret evidence ways consistent personal desires, disregarding differing data.

So utilizing scientific method even vital.

You want question research? Find studies question it.

If can't, stop standing way scientific progress bullshit opinion. socialism fit this? Ya I:""m wondering ready eat ""Triple Washed"" lettuce get everywhere. probably stop buying lettuce giant non-compostable plastic bins anyway though guess... even affecting lungs asymptomatic third asymptomatic people “ground-glass opacities” characteristic Covid-19 abnormalities lungs cell types, Asymptomatic Coronavirus Patients Still Face Organ Condom doesn’t exactly work scenario. Yeah don’t cook lettuce. Poor argument wear glasses don’t wear mask otherwise can’t see. mask isn’t it’s others everyone doesn’t wear mask political reasons. Groups thousands gathering across country threat everyone, wearing masks helps doesn’t mean mass protesting doesn’t cause irreparable spread virus. cause fighting good cause doesn’t automatically mean right way. So, here's new conspiracy theory I've heard before. MIL thinks far fewer COVID cases US what's reported. claims hospitals get funding government based many cases report, they're falsifying test results/death reports get cash. 

I call bullshit theory - ""logic"" thing? anyone else heard this. watches FOX News. Unpopular opinion it’s early tell strategy best. Yes currently Swedish strategy looks bad course couple years corona might better strategy shut everything. early tell. get vaccine works early pandemic would great, would scientific marvel given history vaccine/pharmaceutical development. First criticzed Trump China travel ban January, delayed calling pandemic March, keep flip-flopping recommendations. News flash: oligarchs care you. *California ahead Texas confirmed cases*
Texas: “Not watch!” idea. seem studies long Coronavirus last food, even though they've got studies types surfaces (still many I'd like).

I've heard struggles stay active outside living host, though, longest documented active surfaces 3 days, I've generally operating assumption eating new groceries least much time passed. imagine packaged lettuce lettuce handled 3 days purchased it, though, main risk handling packaging.

At least that's I've operating, know sure. sure wish people studying stuff releasing findings. often replace filter? US is? Look well able assemble demonstrate freely. thought us taxpayers bailed out. subreddit see solely international coronavirus news? sure filter USA reddit fun app taken feed. Everyone know flew US March (all Europe) said screening, distancing, additional procedures, etc landed. Business usual. consipiratorially minded, might suggest giant pandemic fall, specifically around first tuesday November, could seen feature rather bug ot certain groups.

Of course, conspiracy theories, requires competence governance, falls apart, beginning get legitimately worried possibility election able take place. Lettuce keep prayers. 


What? thinking it. left house three months, go work. Y’all telling I’d safe long wore mask used hand sanitizer?! Everyone says hearbreaking...

Ever worked nursing home? stop caring abused too. imagine car use go work need change tyres. chose spend moneys new tyres keep spend vacation. europe changed tyres, postponed vacation they're back work. 

in u.s. wanted vacation much change tyre they'll end crashing car, losing job still vacation. right. gov't right demand wear clothing public, keep body yourself, many things. private entities stores. subject laws soon step foot public.

These rules fuck right individual nude. Though, may puritan holdover cover parts body, many states women legally allowed topless, harmful public health. main reason can't naked store public transport, take shit sidewalk spread disease. good public health, government steps protect people, *should* main purpose. 

Enforcing mask wearing literally vein. Protecting public preventing, much possible, spread lethal disease. 

Your argument essentially similar saying 

""Underwear uncomfortable, allowed rub junk bus seat shit driveway. I'm healthy, worried, going listen scientists media germ theory, give fuck you."" deaths lag infections. 

Unfortunately large increases sick/hospitalized going feeds daily death totals two weeks. means kept old sample sewage water? Even so, sure contaminated later? sure /s. 

Only 6% infected, another 64% pandemic effects small predictable segment population. could handled targeted way avoid lot this. 14% South Carolina backed point impressively. need time go will. Thank you. Interesting.. agree disagree following statement:

Decreased number people dying lightning strikes means we're safe climb trees thunderstorms. Stop posting fear mongering bullshit. enough uncertainty, unsubstantiated claims serve muddy waters further.  Liar. Really? understand 505/million? means 505 deaths per million population.

Many states suffering opened way back around May 1st. may takes time people let individual guards wait month time see secondary tertiary cases. Also since data lag also applies direction, reopening cases decreasing means likely fewer cases open numbers say.

I mean, plenty sources paywalls. So... yes? Problem idiot supporters don’t wear masks, spread actually decent people ugh. Ah, conservative activist synonymous ""dumbshit"" BLM protestors ? hear COVID Florida now. Michigan clear? guys got office manipulating data spin.

They using tools know.

Too bad that’s nature works. addendum story: Within past hour, Dallas County commissioners narrowly passed resolution following contentious emergency meeting require facial coverings ""effective immediately"" middle August. Perhaps little late, **everything** helps. 
 
On hand, Fort Worth Arlington past 24 hours publicly announced intention instituting mask ordnance. surrounding counties (Collin, Denton, etc) silent issue. far. Yep. grandfather caught polio preteen. hospitalized months never finished school catch up. One arms never worked that. dangled there, move around arm. life, dead, hanging, useless arm navigate around. someone who's followed american right whole life: believe it. What's like live complete alternate reality? sold public lockdowns solely basis overwhelming hospitals, proceeded move goalposts several times naive, easily manipulated mouth breathers like ate terrified.

This like foretaste climate change. someone tell hell Disney World plans opening weeks? know Universal smaller parks open, really need close again. 

The state Florida needs roll back Phase 1 ASAP see things stand mid July. daily amount new cases along positivity rate increasing dramatically, seems insane Disney wants reopen four parks within weeks Florida becomes new epicenter. Shame can't get transparent results tests, like pandemic dealing with. Russia. least cases country hidden people. official statistics lie cases numbers Right back atcha there, bud. don’t think looking means stop infection provide partial protection illness elective surgeries still allowed? mean, assuming started back again. Oh well it’s perfectly safe never mind! bad lay 40 million workers social distancing could’ve worn masks work haha whoops illinois pretty damn good tbh. people STILL chill bit. many people stuff. looking GOOD us far cannot die. Viruses satisfy basic requirements classified life forms. able metabolize, cannot reproduce without cells. virus bit genetic code “trending” spreading around higher beings. know it’s difficult understand. don’t fully grasp myself. human beings tons virus dna genome too. Put many ancient infections affected ancestors. It’s crazy, know, look up! There's copypasta cite quoting HIPAA something else saying disclose is. They're state qurantine, coming back Saudi Arabia, there's domestic case long people care number anymore. People know case people come back oversea state quarantine. tho Yep would man nursing home bad year flu. People nursing homes expected die soon. absolutely can. possible, get test. i’m scientist, symptom. open-up brigades lot city subs attempting failing change narrative toward support opening early attacking local politicians taking safety measures.

They completely disappeared recent days. Ikr? idiots bullshit way without realizing That's libertarianism asthma start choking/coughing/stop breathing wear mask.  Oh wow. Seems like hit nerve. guess different perspectives responsibility science communication (my literal ""lane""). better comes promoting scientific literacy general population.

And frankly, dont get participate public forum like lay-person (""shrug. journalism journalism board. Draw whatever conclusions might."") invoke professor (""trust me, I'm professor""). shield get wield criticism. name such, become liable expectations. 

I'm going participate thread further, imagine comment go well first. hoping might take perspective peer something consider. believe probably case, well general increased awareness compared March.

Interestingly enough, went see NYC locked down. announcement made 3/20, exact day first hit 3k cases. put effect two days later. signs hot spot states sort lockdown coming yet. That's think. right hypothesis. actual death rate going down. fact. he's grow crazy ass maga follower base. Guess win win. Actually lose lose society. oh god no. pretty bad here. ""WAiT tWo wEeKs!11"" lockdown skeptics say.... sure. friends Hawaii paid attention value past couple months always far lowest value (~0.5 0.6 range) couple weeks ago Everyone's dude seem little bent shape overreacting whole thing. something bring stress Bonespurs  European health official, spoke condition anonymity discussing initiatives public, said Britain, France, Germany Italy discussing reforms United States **at technical level.** 

Dunno, ""technical level"" sounds like token discussion prevent Trump officials going Twitter, really trying play domestic audiences. pisses off. cannot wear mask checked airline documentation, any, required need wear one flight. told tell gate agents FA board. said absolutely way around it, would've drove. hope don’t get hit hard hope make full recovery soon. people go Thailand for? blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Anyone merely suggest politics off-topic sub pandemic utter moron Conservatism global cancer needs systematically eradicated.

[Half South Korea’s coronavirus cases linked controversial conservative religious Youre fucking moron. Go google ""Real blood americans"" run president. There's reason this, use little pea brain figure out. Hint: bc racism. There's guy local subreddit I'm says can't wear one despite taking medications it, skin condition develops painful rash spreads even minutes usage. speak veracity claims, could possible reason? trump made political. literally said people wear masks show support him.

And yes dumb. Protip: Drag drop PFP reverse image search see stole from. satisfying catch them, though often block get chance. Either way heat kill viruses.

So telling fucking nerd spends day reddit shit means must shape? think I'm projecting, solution project also? I'm confused. need confess something. I'm sick cultural arguments Coronavirus spread faster one country vs others. 

Months ago reading Chinese hygienic culture responsible severity domestic outbreak. month later reading group food culture responsible severity South Korea's outbreak. Many months that, clear China Korea better rest world, read Chinese Korean collectivism responsible beating virus. theory explains everything, actually explains nothing. 

Now, mean imply cultural factors irrelevant, people tend misjudge overall effects exaggerate impact relative factors like public health policies, leadership quality, political institutions. compare presidential rally justified protest look dumb Kayleigh McEnany briefing. Read comments again. He’s 16 year old kid. virus killed him.

No one wondering got infected. stayed home. family careful. got sick anyway. Another poor schmuck cognitively castrated conservatism. He's going quarantine arrives back here. huge risk progress made. glad slow reopening Ontario. I’ve looked last days, I’ve since change opinion hatred directed.

Looking grim Arizona. city issued emergency order wear masks, many residents seem refusing. I'm optimistic order enforced. ICU capacity really want look at, tracks well area deal emergencies. Texas, Arizona, Florida.. ICUs filling fast. test results good trackers real time. addressing pointing out. Cases stayed around 20k daily around US deaths dropping. Look numbers. I'm looking big picture thing doing. theory held weight deaths dropping. Cases staying constant deaths dropping No, unfortunately. suspect supply line issues affecting many industries affecting too, much sourcing China place long cheaper production costs less strict regulating. I've wondered we're bigger second wave.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: everything I've heard, antibody testing accurate 2 weeks recover virus. makes hard gather whether earlier wave.

Where (Upstate / Central NY State) , back December / January, crazy wave something influenza sort weird pneumonia / severe respiratory distress going around. time, one could figure was, it, something pretty serious. recovery would take month more. 


I friends work week, know another person work 3 weeks weird illness.  


From everyone saying back, second wave would much bigger first wave. possible missed first wave? stupid decision mislead public, however good intention. makes worse, lack supply nothing public hoarding everything orchestrated campaign China completely buy everything, stores bulk orders suppliers. stockpiles, nothing done protect domestic supplies around March. Everything bought late January. 

It stupid protecting supply onset new pandemic, stupid\^2 resolve telling public masks work.

In living memory West, never desperate need fast competent action government medical bureaucrats, bodies like WHO. failed abysmally, point lost legitimacy govern make important decisions. think shared sentiment worldwide, channeled various ways, constructive others. stats clearly nowhere near bad said be.

This often repeated lie. exactly ""said be""? 

Scientists doctors long stated can't know actual overall fatality rate numbers crunched. Early pandemic, work percentage deaths compared confirmed cases, United States *still* 5%, even increased testing. estimated .4-1% actual fatality rate still pretty fucking horrific, especially considering contagious virus honestly, believe federal government ""zero response"" pretty clear camp in.

Yes, camp reality. ""zero"" obviously hyperbole. much better, it? pandemic teams typically deploy overseas first hint outbreak? contact tracing isolations confirmed cases? federal government coordinating resources states directing shipments resources them? That's damn job. Modern medicine works 1/2 way. complete disappointing failure comes health building.  

(I say taking vitamin supplements modern. inferred that, delete mind.)     

Vitamin supplements live savers, complete sunbathing.  see minor issues people charge accused of. Barely damage done compared train wreck Trump administration.

I appreciate information.  takeaway stress - light fire everyone uncontrolled stress double stress management strategies: make sure health optimized possible (work eating better diet, sleep, making sure drink water regularly, take 200 mg caffeine day, etc), work discovering right combination rituals techniques help reduce channel stress. different everyone - people find immense relief combative things like boxing practice playing intense video games, others prefer meditative, quiet activities. Activities gently stimulate multiple senses tend effective. key open minded box stereotype!

Exercise also phenomenal blunting chronic worrying, combination temporary hardship forcing distracted, immediate neurological changes triggered exercise.

Finally, end getting coronavirus, need prepared focus even goal - gain absolutely nothing wallowing fear, accept got everything power take mind matter challenging - thats one greatest things make easier body fight. Meanwhile Illinois, cases lowest they’ve months one hardest hit states. economy!! HIPAA apply here? American Airlines medical provider? would ADA apply, airlines bound different law, ACAA? Texan here, we’re basically boat. know everyone keeps saying economy states never shut again, precautions/masks exponential growth slowing, point think happen naturally? in, much longer enough restaurants/bars, stores, businesses positive case longer sustain functioning workforce? lot places shut awhile soon there’s confirmed case, rest staff quarantine precaution. numbers get high enough population, start seeing repeated closings businesses. Maybe government never tell us stay home again, enough population gets sick and/or quarantines, keep things going? dear downvoters, not? imagine someone feeling weather early january covid-19 announced world-wide pandemic. person probably assumes flu get stressed it. say instead, person contracts bug 2 months later they've reading hearing people dying new pandemic sweeping world. cause greater anxiety? least *possible* people experienced acute forms disease direct result informed disease killed thousands without known cure/treatment? I'm sorry governments failed sacrifice financial security order safe. Stop body shaming. I’m going repeat myself. coronavirus sub, talking pandemic. 

If you’re “passionate” millions deaths immeasurable preventable misery it’s clearly wasting time must something important fate world you’re thinking about. fuck Australia? could possibly done make politicized? America shit show expected here, there? places world issues ignorant chunk population making masks coronavirus issue overall something political? He’s never given anything away free. I’m asking friend works state salons going open next week. state says it’s required workers wear face masks, boss told workers don’t wear face masks face shields.

She’s thinking maybe quit work different salon. told might reacting (but also might be. really don’t know e science behind it) decided ask here. don’t know wrote cover story didn’t want make throw away case sees this. mean 21 million people plus people heading beach open theme parks gives pretty long period could run escalating numbers. However, really put problem, healthcare system collapse gigantic problem whole point playing 'flatten curve' game. I’m glad it’s Dallas. We’re bad enough already. Several months?
You mean single 2 week lockdown. outbreaks linked parks? PSA mid flight would likely stir shit air, definitely want that. True, definitely level fighting fire fire, case, violence violence. 

I think reason I’m stuck “screw em all” mentality reptile brains, assume knowing harsh punishment awaits us committing heinous crimes, would maybe persuade evil people act desires. However, they’re already unreasonable evil people, may even case. large % Trump demographic believe facemasks, one. Lol Median also type baseball saga sure interesting follow Also, unless testing random sample population, testing mean people symptoms require testing? even similar percentage positives, necessarily make things significantly better. people sick, would testing done. looking wrong? Several states lockdown fall. certainty. body food source


What mean? info FDA site pets - scroll ""Animals, Pets Animal Drug Products"" section What's bets booked flight solely intention making big scene try get attention cos parents never loved him. corporation anything ensure hold accountable direct action could taking improve health, safety well-being passengers employees certainly virtue signalling.
 
They're free make policy regards passengers like, allow get scot free take responsibility improving environment aircraft. seen president?

They'd sale $24.99 worked hour mask on, big deal got Agreed. I'm saying know one way control it, going happen. 3,800*

FTFY aren’t criticizing him, criticizing misleading title says “healthy”. Oh yeah. agree Oof confusing median mean. Median 5 months.

that EXACT POINT.  Read title thread. incredibly false. applies medical medical insurance industries. point keep insurance companies learning pre-existing conditions. 

**Even then**, formal punishment black mark company's record federal government maybe easily-affordable fine.

People scared HIPAA **their employers** extremely strict policies go law make people get fired. external consequences individual employee's violation HIPAA

In general, legal protections medical information national level. flu. CDC daily surveillance report provided state departments health allows track influenza.   protest attended 100% mask coverage saw dozens volunteers giving free masks. organizers took masks speak microphone everyone attendance marching/listening.

That said, none cops along marching route wearing theirs... ""Not sure getting at"" Naww.. wrong. Make special flight them, load plane, fly away, crash Fkr ground 👌 opinion happen."" mean lol I'm talking tourists come go beach ofc go places that's obvious. 20% infected county non residents. Nah, go visit Chaz. Antifa real course , every state “the economy “ know gonna tank selfish help control it’s election year.. fuckin crock shit election year. coronavirus pandemic, government's lackluster response, tanked economy. economy bad election year, incumbent typically loses. administration mostly interested astroturfing pandemic, mentality trickles followers. aren’t fat shaming, saying article misleading calls “healthy”.  Yeah like everybody else did. 

But weird reason flattened super high level. countries wanted flat low. already counties.

The scary thing is, NY states setting field hospitals *before* ICUs hit capacity.

I see Florida taking steps yet. bio-terrorism kind messages need people hear...sometimes health safety health safety, quit conspiracy theory idiot healthy thing everyone's sake.

ALSO IMPORTANT: 

You wearing mask prevent getting COVID. need everyone wear give COVID someone else. Meaning vulnerable population wearing masks almost jack shit. need vast majority people wearing makes sick asymptomatic people spread disease vulnerable population.

As Arnold pointed 'Just it' Really weird thought read serious virus. Ill google research lol think bad idea, could see resulting bit spread depending big lock talking about. example, let's say things get control Mesa go lockdown Scottsdale stays open things ok there. idiots causing problems Mesa going spill Scottsdale go drink party shop shit local area got shut down. Even peak 550 new cases day. worst daily increase.

Gotta keep border closed. many dumb Canadians flock Florida border opens bring virus back droves. work would nothing cause stupid snowbirds. "" *we think absolutely crucial listen guests.* ""

Ya, obvious bottom line concern; health safety employees. agree completely. case know they’re getting can’t blame others/can’t expect what’s come Trying defend every decision make as, ""trying political.""

The threshold safety, politics. No, need quit eletist BS. shared news news subreddit. think unethical. think misguided. fucking stupid lol. ""I can't wear mask, respiratory difficulties!"" says person exposing virus definitely fuck respiratory difficulties. ""Asshole refuses stop asshole, gets thrown plane."" Good find. guess walk away wherever going instead flying. like use ""conservative activist"" fucking political stance. America genuinely confuses Lol wat? extremely bad PR conservatives. conservative, I'm going anywhere without mask, complain say medical condition asked something reasonable. Anyone makes mask-wearing political issue and/or acts selfishly active disregard others and/or refuses take precautions threat society. suffer consequences, feel sympathy do. miss Verne Troyer. fun guy. masks probably won’t work unless kind surgical mask N95 vents. Shields literally nothing. thing aerosolizes. even surgical masks probably don’t enough, air going thing. man stopped eating learning trump donors. Guess right call Especially looks like confirmed good NHL insider Tampa Bay Lightning close facilities due positive tests among players staff. 

The virus care young are; guys south 30. Hahaha you’re genius, love  point money driving factor trying get back “normal.” wasn’t saying agree it.  eyes right victory. made house wife. **People like make me** absolutely **sick.**

Thats he's banned. ""hurr durr ain't born can't president""

""no i'm racist ask""

read constitution: ""ALL MEN CREATED EQUAL"" ""ALL MEN BORN AMERCIA"" Cases ? read seconds ago deaths keep dropping Gonna intresting see say cases keep increasing testing Nailed it! nobody tell line curve supposed flat horizontally, vertically? Note elderly immunocompromised individuals: work factory plants. Wrong.  Hospitals getting financially hammered this. COVID patients earn hospital far less money surgeries, many elective surgeries going unscheduled.

If would like like really dig stuff, many hospitals non-profits, financial filings public information. may review hospital finances year determine insanity justified. get definition ""healthy"". can't let good news good news? don’t dress seal tub lasts days fridge. hope right  Based studies it’s 19x safer 🥰 reason masks met intense pushback leadership it’s easy, cheap, effective.

The government knew didn’t enough lied public masks would available healthcare workers. Sounds like conspiracy right? admitted it. sounds like Arizona importing cases coming southern Arizona northern Mexico. imagine, ton cross traffic border there, citizens countries lot commerce area. Specifically Nogales. information reflected cases ZIP Code, shows high cases count near Yuma Santa Cruz County. southern Arizona. Phoenix cases, sure, majority imported Mexico along southern border. medical condition

can still wear mask stick butt...jut sayin good news. Fuckin' degens up-country! Give balls tug, titfucker! states! well, many near AZ. How? 1% positive rate people attended protests. Also established testing centers specifically protests. seems worked dude, that's tell ya. believe mean *fingeroni* definitely agree, think dumb they're even considering things normal sports. one might chance averting disaster would something like golf they're checking people twice week much better bubble Promising future punishment nothing stop behavior, especially people short-sighted wear mask protect themselves/others literal plague Averages always skewed outliers, it’s alway best use medians. miss guy say “migrant” ? blaming spike hospitalizations on? Try actually going protest. Nearly everyone wearing didn’t realize lettuce “bleeds” white fluid cut fresh garden started growing. also lasts much longer fridge whole lettuce store. Hooray somebody paying attention us! We're number one!

I live AZ, think ever see another shut AZ, matter bad things get. scary sad. Texas pretty cheap actually right ? I'm claustrophobic also panic disorder. Wearing masks makes feel ""trapped"" lack better word. get incredibly anxious breathing restricted. I've couple instances wearing mask prolonged period time triggered panic attacks. still wear them, need take break every 20 minutes lower mask (while I'm myself, course) get by. Yep, wore masks machine really interacting anyone minute. I'd drive line busy. Seems like would near impossible catch situation knows. Ok. I'll say way understand. higher cases lead rise deaths. Pointing fine means testing. Deaths good indicator faring this. Everything else trash. guys always parrot rising cases narrative there's never anything deaths rising. happening dropping deaths fit baseless claims made impending onslaught deaths. I'm done arguing you. month realize wrong there's huge spike deaths I'll come remind you. Usually, case desperation. claim harassed discriminated against.  think understand hard get test back March April. almost *impossible* unless deaths doorstep. many choices made right thing compromising ethics deluding would made rich connected. spine moral compass? Whats status regarding lockdown ? actually one yet? basing whole opinion videos  really get though. around 2019 take long get control? Surely situations places running hospital beds, space store bodies much sooner? results British study conclusive, it’s proved effective reducing mortality amongst seriously ill significant margin already use UK too. LMAO. No? said it, Karen...

Karens like denying existence systemic racism **is** saying ""black lives matter."" I'm sure see way, part problem. kind welcoming. expecting roll red carpet tolerating anti-science bigotry laughable.

I'm going set remind 2 weeks, give time world go full anti-vax try cobble together rebuttal vast body scientific consensus. guess is, anything, shit like S. Michael Gaddis' work.  means still nothing.

My user name literally reference fact one reddit actually angry, Duck's fan would caught it. Aerosolized airborne. Think like ecig. Read “for dummies” article posted called “The Three Types Average – Median, Mode Mean”

It become clear then. Funny thing Greatest Gen much community caring culture(at least among race). Great Depression kids, WW2 young adults, rose political power able pass Civil Rights acts. 

Baby Boomers ones started selfish family culture. White baby boomers basically life easy mode anything inconveniences feels like world ending. honest god, want mask crowded plane, pony charter flight. Airlines PUBLIC transportation. conform rules tight space others long time. hard understand? really think airlines let without shirt without footwear? would masks age covid different? split country little pieces use whatever state/province/county/city/hospital/nursing home statistics find support view? Yeah, sounds like really clever disingenuous way compare stuff!

Edit: Also, 8 US states one Canadian province still *a lot* claimed was. want hopeful would guess since people leaving house less there’s less ways die hear Floridamen like mandatory 2 week quarantine. refund everyone connecting flights

hmmm...unexpected consequences... virus’ political affiliation? joke?

The virus virus. I’m going stop protecting illness politicians bad people lol exact comment customer refused let store. “I didn’t wear mask back January, wear one now?” Unfortunately figuring exactly much risk protests coincided states reopening. I’m sure transmission protests, looks like surge tied increased indoor interactions states reopening. eat hardtack leave homes year, it’s what’s best us all. Studies show. arguing science? Lol.. guy thinks quarantined. true sad. eventually mandate masks while. conservative activist, bit appreciate media attempting differentiate I'm going preface saying necessarily agree it, always *totally* dumb argument. trying say virus slowed anything. basically saying number cases always proof tests means detect people. 
 
Imagine population 10 people 6 virus. first day 2 tests get 2 positive results. 6 people still virus, testing capacity detect 2 them. next day get 4 tests find 4 positive results. trying say numbers better. saying always 6 people virus show now. feel like sub done another 180 recent days..while obvious concern couple states increasing hospital numbers (AZ, TX) people playing fear younger people getting virus? expected people go back work back spending socializing? He’s another Trump grifter. There’s dozens blue checks like Twitter. Ignore move think get banned one airline wearing mask ban you. stop stupid ass troll shit.  Sure, soon start killing 15% older population one percent general population average, one year period. way tell you’re even performing act question – getting others sick. virus' political affiliation doesnt bother you? convenient you? never imagined people would get violently angry asked wear mask. lowest estimate seen number asymptomatic people half infections, least 2X number.

Other studies put 5X massive borders lot states

There limited number roads entering state. Posting checks roads like done states big lift. Neither asking name contact info entering state monitoring them. think contact tracing works man? NYS already setting groundwork level contact tracing couple months now. lot people live NJ/CT work NY. 


No crap. already roadblocks checks highways pandemic first started - allowing essential workers area. Again, big lift. America's way dealing crisis made unusually ashamed American, there's that. can't believe anyone even considering going rallies. insane. much sympathy people get sick attending things, pass infection others really sad makes angry. willing risk lives lives others get racist rage boner. Becoming president sure hell would refuse rushed Chinese vaccine Well that’s heard Hey, study referring pretty flawed basis reference point severity comorbidities. 

For example, average 80 year old diabetes years left average 80 year old uncontrolled diabetes, data granular enough determine whether controlled not. 

By accounting severity, gave absolute maximum number, reality would much lower. say you’re risk population. Logic I’ve heard lot anti mask anti lockdown group sick follow rules healthy. Maybe wear shirt outlining one kidneys “thank bob kidney!” pain receptors many parts body. almost like it's... shape.. could be.. curve?

Behavior changed (or least day two ago), curve gonna curve. That's does. days gonna records while. Give asshat zero attention. Problem solved. Instead, are. Even me. go Tönnies real meat grinder there. case, staying plane dumbass, who, given attitude towards germs, likely carrier infectious disease, also punishment.

It's lose-lose situation indeed.

But better reduce risk infection lose hours. median age? average? Sunlight masks indeed pretty magical.  I’m millennial bud. rough, go grad school economy bad. luckily able land good gig going pretty recession proof. next four years gonna replay last recession unfortunately. lot hurt gonna done financial assistance given Wall Street corporations.

Even knowing this, I’m still proud. Overall think still potential great nation live potential beacon freedom hope. problem, gotta fucking vote. Change won’t immediate l, it’ll start. Yes agree speed limits seatbelts. like agree mask wearing reasonable measures slow spread. shutdowns? wouldn’t shut driving driving worth risk people. yes Forgive him, research finding youtube videos fit narrative he's expert.

If AZ like me, intelligent regards tech organization, think Arizona residents need find way protest electronically, make known want Arizona use science proper guidelines make policy decisions, want full transparency numbers information regarding Covid, Ducey needs either apologize admit made mistakes working Fauci whomever put lives Arizonans mind rather disregard points Orange party. would able identify part Dam protests? Restaurants re-opened day. large crowds beach weekend well since 3-day weekend.

I know I’m everyone follow RIVM’s recommendation attended self-quarantined past 2 weeks since went Dam protests (I stood back national monument easy maintain 1,5 distance) I'm guessing man. Flashing way threatening rape making unwanted advances. realize trying make point actually advocating nudity public, considered sexual harassment good reason. would say people worry sexual harassment walking street public health concern. what, exactly? Recording newsworthy events? Everyone comes within 12 feet tested Sweden 42,693 active cases today.

Nope, something worldometer states, incorrect. Sweden track active cases, rather cumulative confirmed cases, see link **official** statistics directly FoHM (CDC equivalent Sweden) linked comment. Check top right graph look ""Sjukdomsfall per dag"". talking US data?

The say 1.4 million year worldwide die auto accidents. Covid-19 deaths? don’t understand people lose shit wearing mask acting like freedoms compromised. It’s mask. It’s used protect others slow spread covid-19.... indoor outdoors? thought agreed protests spread covid outdoors. guessing true peaceful protests(no riots/fighting police, kettling,tear gas etc last ones) would almost impact ones didn't. Perhaps could pure determination get back wife son would cause build strength, make sure able see son grow up.

I hope god die muscular atrophy complications raised COVID 19. Please, god... Imagine turd risk lives others minor discomfort. can't people learn. ""Keep germs yourself."" pretty basic concept especially public transportation. Theaters dead... far better experience watching home technology exists make happen. dense? people get sick lockdown. 

And may loved ones catch despite lack empathy and... IQ points. time stop mutilation virus January. doctor said “flu” didn’t tell kind sent way. completely fucked one. don’t remember ever sick life. couldn’t leave bed 3-4 days. Fever fourth day finally broke. Body aches everywhere, trouble breathing cough. thought going die. family convinced COVID. Governments want jobs want support November. don’t think herd immunity covid-19 actually possible *without* overrunning hospitals. matter. Operation must continue save planet. seeing spikes beaches? would behave way Spanish Flu? Probably dangerous going gym. could also 'healthy' quote someone, like mother saying 'he healthy boy!'  one know. thinks hoax,china,soros bs. nothing closed... US gonna break 30k first time since May 1st today. Smartest comment ""discussion."" Mine removed pol***cal. Tried say thing wrong. One data point got sick many people sick remember meeting cancelled many people out. 



It made wonder ever since bad. thought kinds ideas. it, test failed? flu strain bad(I H1N1)? Could another novel virus went undetected first found assumed one. many false tests. would love know, assume didnt it. know statements constantly get downvoted. virus here, going away. American small European country, eradicate chance thanks incompetent leadership. need learn live protecting vulnerable keeping healthcare capacity sufficient. They’re dropping fast too, need wait see it’s taking virus long time kill people actually good news. state underreports numbers too. Hamilton Knox County higher case counts per county health departments state provided map article. flight attendants know older retiring. political delete  allowed anyway, pelts ""ready"". They're full winter.

The breeders unfortunately get compensated government though.

I wish Denmark would end mink farming make much money it. Hopefully anymore. (was made different Asian country, yes).

whose working conditions totally better, right? message inconsistent. Science consistent either need training interpret science oz common sense. Unfortunately lot cases absent. NBA make bubble Disney World. Well definition CRE narrow...

Industrial, manufacturing, warehouses, distribution centers, data centers CRE well good job hate her. 

She perfect, white, blonde, cross necklace always visible good lying. political journalist New York Times, Astead Herndon, sitting next seat also recorded dispute.

LOLL fuck media There's disability covers thick cunt. Covid behave simmilar way Hispanic Flu need lockdown. First wave Hispanic flu end tens thousands deaths, second tens millions. 

So chance, half year everybody know somebody died, scared enough go outside without government regulations.  many people killed job?

For answer zero.

And I've worked restaurants, antiques, factories, hospital. often meet extremely hostile people. killed zero them.

It seems like maybe cops everyone else kill people protests would stop.  matter need gain back trust, done nothing that. took even money China US dropped Never said need test many people. it’s impossible either. test show someone isn’t symptomatic. know. Like someone came contact known case, they’d go get tested. mean ignorence science general come pandemic it? Pandemic happened find concern tho? spread me? get sick.. ok. different life usual? Life alone inherently dangerous, would walk around fear? “lockdown”. life hasn’t really changed much. 

Everyone living constant fear. It’s good. guess still governor FL did. governor NY same.  No, he's using median days remaining. Average days remaining far, far higher.

Your argument make sense kind reasonable way. Everyone NYC knows someone 500 days death died 1-month period. That's far lower herd immunity reached. everyone NYC knows someone died car accident entire lives. don’t get it. I’m going pretend buy everything related Covid-19, data e seen doesn’t add make sense. know I’m scientist, fucking idiot doesn’t pay enough attention. wear mask case I’m wrong. Masks worn prevent potential transmission. I'm dad's link outside world now. He's serious medical issues past couple years survived ICU docs told us he'd likely alive. wear mask go get meds groceries I'm afraid catch virus outside transmit him. practice distancing meet home too. may laugh people wearing masks try understand situation judging. Covid19 hurt deadly dad. People pets pandemic hit. suggesting put pets decrease spread? opposed keeping contact keeping inside? understand suggesting. probably closer 30% point That's 140,000 cases day reported worldwide 20,000 day US. World Health Oganization matter. Science defeated politics. Please keep mind whenever hearing anything claims science reported current administration representatives thereof. long don't. virus spreading rapidly population. Next week likely days 5000+ new cases. need start mitigating. Start mandating masks. Ok herd immunity would slow crawl around 60 percent US pop. would looking total death 1.1 million. likely year. could slow spread years least fairly low impact mitigation measures. let’s say 3 years. basing days stolen calculation based early estimated average death age 72. updated known 78-80. let’s generous cut estimated average days remaining 500. works 500 million days stolen over, let’s say 3 years. Compare living days stolen auto accidents USA period, would well three times higher 1 billion, 875 million. Good luck, maybe virus spare you! /s Lol. guys put him... third option, burns state like wildfire nothing gets shut massive steep peak fall. I'm sure that's true. Again, look Florida's numbers. Everyone thought Florida would decimated saw pictures college kids partying spring break, state locked nursing homes early kept fatalities really low result. need start sealing state borders. CT 11 new cases today wants none nonsense. Michigan 211 new cases today 5 new deaths perspective states better governors. Crossing fingers, though. never shied away saying Sweden late take action, understanding main reason got high infection list. Seeing curve flattened, admitted comments mine, goes show strategy valid, though implemented weird reason flattened super high Sweden flattened curve high level Put head sand. That's expected. wish virus anyone, but... I’m confident, do? lost left one dodging STDs 70s. personal Vietnam. fumar en el bano post removed cannot verify reliable source.

What’s point? according Reddit, China totally sentient entity Vaccines already passed safety trials. testing efficacy (which takes way longer since ""challenge trials""). feel pretty safe main vaccines moment. herd immunity strategy tries outright encourage people gather unlike Sweden. interesting move. Thank this, aware details!! Covid actually prevents deaths, huh?

Thank Sweden. 5000 vain. Last daily briefing. last briefing ever. kidding. Unfortunately, there’s base contend too.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Point one Swedish official said record higher **case-fatality rate** expected strategy. one. That's case fatality rate, infection rate. Try, one official, let's see it. believe Covid real, threat? believe Covid vaccine going do? attributing malicious intent Bill Gates? also believe fight malaria suspicious? seem Minnesota far.  huge demonstrations riots, special testing far spike. open borders unless want immediate reversal. 

Don’t open restaurants gyms indoors GTA anytime soon. 

Watch happening elsewhere learn. get benefit watching every decision play make one. Don’t mess Canada hit winter northern hemisphere, middle flu season, also causes pneumonia. early outliers would considered flu cases, discovered flu different virus. 

if summer northern hemisphere instead, flu cases lower, would noticed much faster something strange going around Yep. Still see Certain subreddit time. “Used cool kiD, I’ve seen tRuth” et al. It’s exhausting keeping bad faith comments.  also bad flu year top 50 000 active cases.

Sweden 42,693 active cases, need better job closing old cases out. New York thing. 290,469 active cases NY? That's every positive test since April 1st. way that's accurate number.

Going official ""Active Cases per 1,000,000 Population"" though... Sweden indeed 2nd. (note: data missing Spain, UK, Netherlands)

&amp;#x200B;

|Country|6/18 active cases / (Pop/1000000)|
|:-|:-|
|Qatar|7376.9|
|Sweden|4229.1|
|USA|3662.9|
|Armenia|3654,9|
|Bahrain|3347.0|
|Peru|3210.0|
|Belgium|2929.4|
|Oman|2636.0|
|Belarus|2360.2|

Practically speaking, country probably around 20,000 active cases realistically, would put Sweden's active cases / million pop around 11th worst world, least behind Belgium, right?

Look... like patriotic defending countries. I'm American, I'll go first. country's response bad. Half states done well believe not, half, well, ten worst pretty bad, NY abysmal. US gets F far. Sweden... maybe D. Better positive cases, worse deaths, honestly death total completely related Swedish response. way structure elderly care homes, workers multiple jobs multiple residences problem detected early on. would taken genius foresee problem time, IMHO.

These grades provisional. end taking gradual herd immunity route force, maybe countries upgrade ""C"".

I like country. like country's approach new ideas. right now, talk strategy much. less brilliance proposed be, right looking like many winning strategies. end, might stop blaming finding perfect heroic response time, blame virus. Congratulate winning round. pernicious fucked us good. We'll settle knocking end. would absolutely love go. whole family got March. Take advantage immunity. 

Alas Florida requires everyone NJ quarantine arrival. someone took train 2, sometimes 3x day Jan-middle March, wonder antibodies, don’t trust tests yet. continue go little possible &amp; course take necessary precautions out. seems really high. I'm suspicious. you’re hypocritical ““Eighteen new cases today it’s effect result protests. course there’s small surge nursing facility, combo 18 cases,” Green explained”

....we’ll see happens days that’s surge seeing, one else reporting anything significant protests yet, either dodged biggest bullet ever outside mostly masked effective suppressing virus. we’ll see final numbers guess. Agreed. would better months ago, better all. 
 
The best time plant tree 20 years ago. second best time now. Maybe upfront since beginning. local area, received emails schools would fully opening. days later received another email saying going happen. I'm going that. know schools partially opened though. shirt read end:

Yes, asshole. correct it?

&amp;#x200B;

 Can't say developing countries, around factors. 

Young people getting tested young people know still get tested, plus ones facing pressure get back unsafe work conditions recently, plus starting become careless before. adds up. Cultural differences, season covers amount months fiscal quarter, like us saying new iPhone would come Q3. Nope, [testing leveled recent weeks, positive cases also see super helpful percent people testing positive increasing, definitely increased testing - really spreading.

Plus percent people test positive already fairly high, almost 10%. comparison, places control like NY NJ, 1 2 percent test positive. yeah, looking good. Well he’s got mentality child exempt. Hospitalizations apparently spiking. That's bad. Deaths follow. Tell they're resuscitating loved ones stop get body bag. News flash .. 

It's probably safer participate outdoor protest (when almost everyone wearing face mask), attend indoor church service, campaign rally, gathering friends, etc. (when people wearing masks). That's like saying somebody respect opinion fire cold. 

You can't opposite opinions scientific facts, MIL trying opposite opinion scientific fact. works. Betsy DeVos frankly, dont get participate public forum like lay-person (""shrug. journalism journalism board. Draw whatever conclusions might."") invoke professor (""trust me, I'm professor"")

Why not? like it? gave badge? 

 free whatever choose. keep oppressive aims yourself. Welcome conscious world, verything's still fire nah  flight, could banned going forward would assume, idk saying okay long result HI

Were they? provide source single Swedish public official saying high **case-fatality rate** drawback strategy? Case-fatality rate, infection rate. really don’t know go :( Sure, take mask eat popcorn. Tons us wear glasses masks issues. ban getting education? Thank helping out! :) Shit like get ""Do Fly"" list. usually life sentence. current environment, COVID-19 became political, think inevitable. imagine demographics attending convention going meet multiple categories high risk. think parks ever closed belgium netherlands. wrong, OP lying say average length stay nursing home 5 months. 

Period. Google want. wrong, lie. It’s still responsibility understand rules airline travel, including can’t carried on, identification need have, policies come (including mask policies). 

The TSA made several adjustments cannot carried years. matter policy implemented, applied travelers, regardless purchased tickets. policy changes would unenforceable applied people purchased tickets policy implemented. TIL fair, illustrate unaffected America WWI. Good Luckily mayors finally making masks mandatory cities.

like 3+ months way late. I’m. FREAKING OUT. also dealt virus significantly better countries listed above, death rates across board significantly lower. comparing countries similar death infection rates, nursing home deaths almost exactly same, implies single regulation action makes significant difference. ""provisional"" death count. Nice bit misdirection there. absolutely it. rutin types Adhd, know many anxiety depression. prescription ends, often gotta again. However, know innocent looking people slided system. 

My point it... Everything restricted write laws every year taking away individual responsibility. arguments good Covid suddenly, Alcohol, weed, cigarettes nicotine taxed moon. 
DUDE.. even god damn paternity leave. Families responsible enough make choices family. government forces parents take leave.. Writing laws it. even trusted handle ourself.. pandemic.. got this.
Don't find weird? least consistent. get mad see blame citizens raise numbers. individual responsibly want smoke, beer Sunday, work little bit extra give patternity leave partner? ranting now. Ya, it’s called trolling. That’s he’s doing. ain’t half New York gone damn near 900 deaths day however long... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* highly doubt it. make money. would financially stupid open #1 money maker. Also makes mask requirement stupid restaurants requiring masks walking table. GOOD. 

An airline (private business) every right require everybody, including passengers, wear mask protect employees passengers flight. someone problem this, need flying let alone traveling all. fact, really hope airlines reasonable protocol place. Wearing mask hours difficult thing all. Cytokine regulation glucocorticoids nothing new, effectiveness COVID debated. [previous reports outright denied value corticosteroid COVID evidence emerges, we're better sticking immunosuppressants confidence working real benefit using dexamethasone things like tocilizumab really cheaper. Even things appear secondary protecting house cards houses Donald Trump's ego. Speaking which, wonder Roy Moore feels masks? seems think should’ve allowed requiring mask “not federal law.” Per FAA, federal law comply instructions airplane staff? went Clemson ton football players test positive week. south going lose fucking mind cancel season don’t see go on. can't prove claim then, like thought. unsurprising. NYC entering phase 2 reopening Monday. Theyve hardly reopened anything ofnyet. said, im hopeful herd immunity + mask wearing slow spread considerably. air marshals for, neutralize terrorists plane? Whether political motivation kill via box cutter deliberate refusal wear mask, outcome same. Air marshals obligated put bullet them. also learn China count cases them. flights seating them, yes  Voting interests helluva drug Right. what's take away ""health care providers admit political reasons practice social distancing""? exactly happened expect others listen advice? That’s fair, I’m fraternity school south, I’ve enjoyed experience far, I’m also aware valid criticisms Greek life addressed. Give redditor cigar. Conservatism = Stupidity USA! USA! Frankly, know talking about. 

You correct metrics better others -- hospitalizations &amp; testing positivity rates, addition deaths, quality indicators however. 

If case count increases solely due increases testing, would expect see % positive rate *drop* total number cases increases.

In Texas, (where live pay closest attention), certainly case.

% Positives doubled 5% governor touted reopening. Additionally, hospitalizations COVID dramatically steep upward trajectory. 

As trend began earnest bit week ago, expect increase deaths 2-4 weeks. coming, unfortunately. We're still relative stable NorCal. Hope trend continues. Studios may cut share ticket sales allow movie theatres survive without selling concessions. I'm wearing mask. use rushed vaccine made country constantly shipping poor quality products abroad. mean think science saying? everything coming says N95 surgical mask, much anything protect personally. reducing spread infected, asymptomatic otherwise. That's frequent hand washing social distancing important. 

So please give us special scientific insight contrary. Potential good news then? I'm guessing combination somewhat effective vaccines variety somewhat effective treatments different phases infection need globally get back normality. figure I’d “lockdown”? 

How loved ones catching something affect me? 
You’re still answering question..

I harmed someone else gets sick. Idk that’s hard understand. getting upset? believe threat. Go nuts. Good you? would like know schools plan outbreak occurs. would plan students dorm floor become positive? quarantine entire floor 14 days? instructors plans enable students complete class sick isolation?  
  
I thinking dorm like common area 1 communal bathroom floor. something curious know different school. That's always wonder. someone medical condition prevents wearing mask, almost certainly avoid public much possible.. means flying Trump rally. 

Autism anxiety could legitimate reasons, anxiety, force stuff want time anxiety. want go Trump rally bad, push anxiety flight (and many people anxiety flying anyway?). Autism can't particularly speak personal experience see others covered it. 😂 California setting daily records new evidence got COVID protests? Large scale data saying protests contribute much spread COVID  Yes, .... disappointing interaction. particularly enjoyed called elitist suggesting accessible scientific summaries laypeople lol. 

I’m saying academics never get relax internet (I joined Reddit discuss reality tv shows god sake). don’t get simultaneously invoke knowledge feign ignorance. 

I hope research continues go well thanks trying combat knee jerk scientific misinformation Reddit. I'm going paste suggestion gave someone else asthma considering wearing masks, like PITTA Japan, basically thin barely impede normal respiration still giving appearance wearing cloth mask (they meant allergies/pollen, containing cough although work degree). condition would prevent wearing cloth mask, would opt wearing one hassled also worry around still keeping distance covering face elbow needed cough. There's nothing find. He's patriot offends them. masks available one person took advantage. question feed homeless get argument them? Probably best. Could worse.. az twice big population wise 5x daily cases. like virus right lololol site see positive rates? keep finding total cases Bras uncomfortable! still wear one work Kevin isn’t distracted tits weekly meeting new leave policy! cocktail destruction Awesome, that’s great you, seriously. everybody sat around writing stories day, we’d starve, die due lack healthcare, get idea. make distinction “work” “jobs” say don’t want latter anymore, somebody to. Authors great people make things make life worth living, end day, somebody menial “jobs” literally live Agreed. According typical progression take turn wordr something like 2-14 days exposure onset symptoms, 5-10 days symptoms hospitalization. see data time hospitalization death gotta additional lag, plus added time get deaths properly coded reported. expect rising cases mean rising deaths several weeks No, guys think Newsome dictator like Adolf Hitler masks tyrannic freedoms taken away. 

LA county. completely different virus? idea, know guy personally, I've seen mention times. Apparently takes medication condition might clothes issue. Also, wearing mask breathing bit different different wearing clothes I'm sure valid comparison get coming from. Black list ass. thing less full attempt terrorist attack. WANTED make plan unsafe infect others. Charge cunt done it. modeling whole government Russia. wonder least make Christmas cruises? think. Opinions lockdowns done cause nobody adheres anyways. could change public opinion masks maybe that's enough good luck that... Cause science political. yea like y'all refusing wear mask like Chinese. think reading comments gave COVID.  dont think people used getting absolutely hammered &amp; bedridden illness 2 weeks time. concerning virus lottery susceptible death thing. prepared assume parents grandparents certain die contracted. What? essential worker unemployment terminated refuse work. That's standard operating procedure across board.

Also, anyone filled dread thought going sitting crowded room windows people wearing masks simply paying attention. K think case 
very easily distinguishable.

Here, dealing interstate borders rather internationally travel, dealing travel ban one state another state.

The Privileges Immunities Clause almost certainly prohibits this. least, would receive highest level judicial scrutiny. doubt single-state ban could hold up.

Interesting issue though. said essentially pol***cal affiliation important got removed. But, call v e r z cultists, apparently acceptable. Hmmm. Okay, also seems super legit! facial reconstruction cases autism far. admits wrong questioned legality states quarantining New Yorkers lol lot better -100% Taking cues Orange see. Man gonna fun. happier Trump, cronies supporters packed Corona rave. administration joke keeps giving. Northern Floridian here. colleagues day drinking bars speak. It’s actually insane. 24 outbreaks *all* open schools seems less scary 

The report even say outbreaks caused - “two people experiencing similar illness, appears linked particular setting”. There's confirmation even related C-19. could cold, stomach bug.. anything. 

Bugs viruses run community time - especially schools creches. pretty harmless actually strengthen immune system. isolate everyone months time, weakens immune system, we're going see lot people getting sick different things normally would effect them. goes window pandemic.

Gotta put O2 mask helping others all. conservative activist ardent supporter President Trump

That's lot words 'an insufferable prick' increase testing doesn’t event matter. fact many people begin we’re spreading virus entire time previous couples days enough say future going get worse let’s lock people exposed spread . Activist? Really? unfortunate part, got *really* wanted, notoriety. publicity stunt, he's minor celebrity hero alt-right conservative circles.

Brandon Straka? He's activist. He's cheesy poser, zero substance, chanting alt-right slogans, he's got, he'll ever have. Fuck guy. UV light rumored kill virus. Possible protesting safe day, unsafe night. also leads question tests done. people symptoms contact known carrier? everyone needs test actually get one? retesting people, healthcare workers, daily basis? tests comes questions it’s scapegoat want use instead responsible adults IMO. surprised.

Shit thought right supposed conspiracy theorists... yikes. want think pretentious job title looking shit 30k today.


Already 25k. Still got least 3k Texas Cali. Still got Louisiana, 1000+, 2 backlog yesterday's. Plus several thousand around country. Yeah, Chandler resident would believe got check-checked lmao. Damn. PA way bigger pop wise, too. accounted variables, claiming conclusions data doesnt show.

And yes, fuck things even later year Florida didn’t fuck up, literally sabotaged themselves. extremely sensitive skin breakout/get slight rash wearing mask well, especially subway platforms hot I'm sweating mask. definitely hurts confidence could itchy. I'm sure quite possible someone could even worse point rash/breakout quite painful.  Fly... care die mask wear lengths time without problems? states powerless anything stop spread. real sticky situation is. pandemic, people protesting mass numbers refusing even wear ppe, godspeed... I’ve reading age correlate real causes — heart disease, diabetes, lung disease. Read one analysis said account pre-existings, much age effect morbidity. Covid data preliminary. Well, let's see that:

FL

* testing increase last 7 days:  +2.4%
* increase cases last 7 days: +89.7%

TX

* testing increase last 7 days: +20.1%
* increase cases last 7 days: +53.7%

So yeah, they're full shit, especially FL.  That's counting counting COVID related strokes permanent lung scarring.  guess I’m one getting looks lol, got glared Walmart tons people last week wearing one counted 3 non employees wearing them. It’s like nobody Tennessee believes it. Masks provided one took advantage. servers told serve regardless. Yeah know

Specifically guy. Hes going get it. Masks inherently political, many conservatives America decided make political issue. Right?

I relative screen size couch, 4K TV damn good screen, 7.2 sound system quite theater quality that’s ok don’t haul family across town movies deal sticky surfaces super expensive concessions.

And least pandemic theater movie demand $20! That’s half I’d pay matinee tickets family.

I'm sure coincidence nyt journalist sitting next committed PR stunt. gullible fuck, ppl like always slaves whatever narrative media wants tell. badly deviated septum awaiting minor surgeries resume.

One friends local radio host posted poll potentially mandating masks Tallahassee. Naturally, got many responses. 95% “MAH RIGHTS!!! SLIPPERY SLOPE!!!! FREEDOM!!!”


One comment even said “I’m tired civic liberties stolen! REFUSE wear mask!!!!”


So, yeah. sympathize you. never good I'm told.  Regardless, one time I've order takeout so-far Pandemic Chick-fil-A week ago.


Let tell you, they're GIVING SHIT.

No Dine-In
All employees wearing masks
Minimal, none, person person contact Living Nashville awesome. 

Broadway cesspool though, luckily city great job taking money tourists keeping one area ruining city. Please judge Nashville time square. Explains everything; thank you. wearing one now. Tulsa indoor gathering arena. big difference appears outdoor spread way less indoor spread might even fire one event results many fear be.. even get multiple articles telling us opposites. politicians making statements. inconsistencies articles treatment options. super interesting! main color coding state chart based last figure, COVID + rate increasing decreasing? live halfway Tampa Orlando. really hope city/county requires mandatory masks soon, I'm holding breath. deeeeeeeeep trump country. huge disparity type people live metro areas like Tampa/Orlando people smaller cities/rural areas Florida. MULTI-TRACK DRIFTING! yet Spanish Italian banks haven’t closed. realize banks haven’t held loans originate well past generation? fucking serioys comment? 

People losing jobs, homes, loved ones, complaining breaking GF? Pretty sure snowbirds second residence there. Believe say intelligent person willingly going Florida right now. guys fucked, sorry. Wearing masks social distancing cut transmission 75%. New Zealand eradicated residents, keeps brought travelers abroad. It’s certainly doable together. daily infection curve Johns Hopkins tracker we're back daily new cases around May 1st (27k), completely wiping downward trend past month.

Yes, symptoms basically laundry list. tested 99.1, cold malaise. came back negative - two office mates (at time, early on) ill time, one quite seriously, one mildly.

It's entirely possible covid symptoms varied could easily be.

Hopefully, covid, it'll mild makes difference you, long safely isolate. Except fatigue, north still wearing everywhere. leadership enforcement businesses. 

We tired too. We've restrictions since March 21. let Target without mask, there's huge sign door closed entrance monitor sides. let 200 people home Depot once, stand line wraps around building masks required, one buy one $1. Thems rules. Bye Felicia. China first country detect virus apparently traveled multiple countries multiple continents. *can't* wear mask eating popcorn sipping drink. That's simply incompatible movie experience.

The feels heck lot like faux outrage. seriously doubt poor $1.99 much ask public safety cannot least sacrifice couple t-shirt sleeves. agree making masks available free, many people legitimate excuse wearing people panic: stressed normal life mean going die covid-19. Stress good either way study specifically refers admissions high-level cortisol body distress way predicting outcome. metric. someone comes ER ill high cortisol, likely die. generalize every person world though. risk sounding like smug European would argue anti-intellectualism bigger problem America countries, Americans dumber, complex set reasons. 

I think big countries largely monolingual higher tendency towards people live bubbles disregard outside world. People small European countries learn English young age exposed foreign viewpoints much earlier purely naturally, exposure think helps understanding big variations world his. risk getting stuck ones culture lower. 

I think anti-intellectualisms strange cultural tendencies widespread countries like China, Russia, even extent Italy France, people much less likely exposed foreign cultures, thus never really question worldview lot. 

The trouble arises combine anti-intellectualism actually consider one strong points American cultures, high tendency question authority.

With said, anti-intellectualism also widespread Europe regarding matters like anti-GMO antivax, notably present France well. Europeans, especially northern eastern Europeans, higher tendencyt comply authority, including scientific authority, Americans. 

These factors combined causes anti-scientificf anti-intellectualism greater sway America. Hence president America elected basis denying climate change, countries. 

That's thought least. Lifting order horrible idea. second everyone starts going public cases going skyrocket again. 

The incompetence shown decision baffling. feels like done one reason one reason only.

I complain wide variety subreddits, one. Victor Orban, would trust word Hungary. ""Excess deaths"" would statistic *might* accurate. Maybe deserve catch virus? Stupid stupid does. right. could used better choice words. Maybe ""come senses"" ""acknowledge bias,"" ""stop politicizing wearing mask,"" etc. seem like many sleep walking, anesthetized screens social media echo chambers. think used much true lot ways. Thats great attempting sound like trump typed  stop treating people ICU space frees up! Bingo bongo simple! I've always wanted nice boat. come trailer? Mutations Uh times proves able protect important. I'm even total gun-nut anything like damn. be, although definitely first Chik-fil-a positive covid cases. think makes 4th 5th location past month.

Seems might problem employees taking seriously taking enough precautions. Missouri City Beaumont Texas, Loganville Georgia, Reston Virginia, possibly others point.

Just search Chik-fil-a coronavirus they'll pop up. that? pin point defenders murder... pin point using hyperbole? Previously, read main concern pet Covid-infected household touched someone else.

It looks like they’re mainly reiterating let pets roam freely. Limit travel interaction; stay home. pets.

My cat needs outside time always supervise (he’s basically dog) it’s like he’s running around place interacting people/pets (he’s mostly scared others). risk case likely low.

It’s human neighbors, _are_ roaming interacting freely, worry about. fucked part whole lot counties vote near 90% one party other. Could imagine showing vote county that’s overwhelmingly guy you’re one wearing face mask? Related nothing trump, stop making everything political.

Every country needs open economy back doomed, death damage economy depression far greater covid 19.

You cant keep economy closed much longer.the virus gonna stay us vaccine cure. almost like trying destroy America... Oh, alright - I'm extra tired rn. study supposed subjects antibodies, without actually verifying presence months ago. means there's evidence antibodies vanished Excuse me:)

Anyway... personally.. idea civil discussion... murder

I cant even imagine would lived somewhere boxing considered defensive sport sore throat came nearly instantly, searing felt like throat slit.

I say instantly walking car go grocery store, 30 seconds took went nothing searing pain.

And yes, pinkeye symptom. never really really ""full blown"" pinkeye eyes slightly red irritated looking. every day pussy itchy, stayed way mid march sore throat started around mid May. doctor China first sounded alarm ophthalmologist. 

I notice afterwards, I'm dark room window bright outside, like I'm looking milk. February sight like all. cataracts starting, eye doctor told would several years noticed. wonder got accelerated.  Interesting article. don’t understand random business people shady names experience ppe awarded contracts first place.  
  awarded least dozen contracts first-time vendors, including **California businessman patented workout equipment** signed onto nearly million-dollar deal provide city hundreds thousands masks. **The city also agreed pay local political strategy firm $100,000 secure face said he’s working municipalities, far Austin. mid-May, **he posted website called Go4WorldBusiness, asking million masks**, $3.10 each, delivered Qatar; Cayne said working secure masks city Middle Eastern nation.  
  requested copies documents city used vet Cayne’s ability acquire N95 masks; city said information share.  
  city recently agreed pay $810,000 **EnergyFundz,**a firm Houston, undisclosed number N95 masks. company’s president, Raya Guruswamy, told KUT Tuesday contract since absorbed “larger entity” would name yet deliver N95 masks part deal.  
  city agreed pay $88,000 early April MedtoMarket Inc. 5,000 N95 masks 100,000 nonsurgical masks. delivery came month later, thousands masks returned. Strength training wonders body. Including improved bone density, imagine effects older adults is. pop specifically says ""create free account unlock"" ligma account BS. Licking finger separating makes easier. reports different (weeekly??)

Source that? referring post's article, think there's something mistaken on. Purely hypothetical work home. get COVID, employer liable? Agreed. ideal. ideal situation robust Test, Trace, Isolate infrastructure keeps level infection low even eradicates locally. Something least experts said theory possible Sweden: yes, sadly, gets point lockdowns *can* happen since allowing continued spread collapses healthcare system hell breaks loose sadly seen places world. PREVAILED That’s one way inherit house. happy moron running. vic berger good piece - math works out, Sweden IFR 100%. Check post history man. He’s favorite Reddit celeb, Snoop Dogg close second. false. None suggest original post unnecessary irrelevant coronavirus subreddit.

This reply suggests two things. brave enough admit racist prejudiced, negative person. can't shake feeling Americans would concerned virus physically disfiguring. None happened. Notably, large-scale event hosted indoors—at 20,000 person arena—with attendees required wear masks, receive temperature checks door

It's unclear whether masks even ""required"" safe assume even formalize requirement, loosely followed definitely enforced.

I'm also curious effective temperature checks given weather - Tulsa gets pretty hot daytime. Perhaps UK. 

Ireland, though, deal People ripping sanitizer wall children’s cancer hospital. Humans assholes. Imo definitely compare country.. live Austria, 8 Mio inhabitants (2 Mio less Sweden) way higher population density. hard lockdown wear masks. less 700 deaths here! Wtf Sweden. told quarantine next 14 days.

Which know observed people take precautions like masking would stop pandemic anyway. We've known long time already dogs tested positive showing manner symptoms. think impossible catch them?

Plenty people also saying ""they've found two dogs it"", would ask many dogs thought tested. Usually made uncomfortable silence continued ignorance.

I'm expecting changed behavior anyone- already can't bothered common decency wear mask public give precious restaurants bars.

This going hammer us fall winter, worse ever before. love people think shitty plastic sneeze guard gonna jack protect them. Security theatre. Reddit ban paywalls really need go beyond one Fauci, Surgeon General, WHO, CDC limited plethora research papers paper walls they're worth. Hes talking really thin bags produce section vegetables rolls slightly adhesive/clingy.

The way people open lick finger. irritant sometimes otherwise.  Americans athletes, performed badly, spread everybody Wuhan caused banks close.  Good news, I'm conspiracy theorist means, usually trust facts reputable sources back claims comes sceptical beginning pandemic see Trump would want quit. know main reason shift blame change fact made strange claims decisions along way ever seemed benefit China. long term consequences like advising mask longest time, calling countries closing borders waiting long declare pandem. I've decided completely stop following advice follow CDC, Robert Koch HSE (local health authority Ireland) publish. Exactly I'm sorry even though might agree sentiment extremely childish condescending way say it. He's competing Brazil. Guessing god owed rooster (who signals coming dawn) price paid bringing *light*, i.e., *knowledge* people. I'm also guessing Asclepius Socrates believes knowledge/wisdom/critical thinking ultimately restorative. K S

Look protest pictures.

I'm AZ. Many people wearing masks distancing. Discussion


More 40% Latinos Baltimore-Washington, DC metropolitan region tested SARS-CoV-2 positive, much higher proportion racial/ethnic group. SARS-CoV-2 testing inclusion criteria standardized, differential access testing may contributed higher rates positivity; Latino patients historically demonstrated lower rates insurance health care utilization.3 However, alternative explanation may higher disease prevalence, spread infection among Latinos driven decreased opportunity social distancing setting dense housing continued work engagement due essential worker status economic necessity.1,4,5 30 year old daughter became believer masks go ER two weeks ago. saw woman intubated fully awake another elderly man come Covid positive wheeled past sheet hours later. 

The memory seeing gives anxiety seeing people wear masks. talked days tries get coworkers wear masks (nobody SC wears them). 

It end vaccine distributed, looking like early 2021. point, people feel risk vaccinated protect instead relying mask wearing others. don’t want risks vaccine choose take chance virus. Kinda like flu, get flu shot protection choose too. Nobody US wears masks, panics shuts anything flu.  yep, get it. Overall, economy never fully recovered. Jobs came back necessarily good, high-paying jobs (as example). 10000% realize things unwanted babies lot given since parents means give baby care deserves. Worse off, babies simply abandoned. What's stance that? understand comment. Yes, Swedes super high casualties. these, many Swedes finally voluntarily forced months ago government. voluntary social distancing measures never full effect forced lockdown, yet show numbers, decline records set previously. Sweden's numbers longer grow despite government still imposing necessary lockdowns.

The argument trying make reduction Sweden due ""something missing"" like yet undetected way gaining immunity, due Swedes fearing lives ramping voluntary social distancing measures. Fair enough! dead pan right. :) Umm..yup sounds fallacious. know certain mean nobody knows certain.

Shit's slowing there's quite logical, non-exclusive reasons it. ain't mystery - general, probable reason pinpointed one. Paul v. Virginia, 75 U.S. 168 (1869) case law would get thrown nice quick. 

He could require screenings all, seem effective way screen. 

At moment, appears states like Michigan track contain Covid going deal people coming hot spots seed outbreaks. 

The best way mitigate already: mask up, bitches. car catches fire garage, garage? smell it. flee die asphyxiation. awesome. Thanks much kid loved go early morning Sunday shows get coffee nurse whole time. Chill Sunday morning coffee better experience busy Friday night junk food. junk didn’t make sense early easily skipped it. Changed whole theatre experience. Pretty much business post violation sub rule avoid politics. explain locked happens others far less political content? Joe Rogen’s guy high school football team quit junior year sell weed drop acid weekends, still hangs football buddies. comment doesnt accurately describe PPP loabs work all. Yeah, herd immunity strategy just... Ugly. hard know exactly chose likely part motivated economic consideration (despite recent official denials contrary). 

The good news making *lot* noise pivoting Test, Trace, Isolate. hvae also allocated funding testing contact tracing. opened app booking times get tested Stockholm became slow use due demand (an app shut maintenance poorly designed hey least tried). 

There signs plague ship Sweden sloooooooooooooowly turning around join Nordic, European international consensus implement Test, Trace, Isolate strategy. certainly weird. Public health politicized. Trump shambles throughout pandemic. Yep. Buckle buckaroos Makes perfect sense, everyone saying virus started cities would take time get rural counties. Nothing new there. Correct political issue. cost/benefit issue. 

For places like US, super easy, benefit way cost billion times, places like NZ. place number active cases less 1/1000000 testing cheap available, pay cost masks? bad choice could kill me, friends, family, lousy human being. that's putting lightly. actually kid troubles home, told they're coughing house.

They told whole class coughing sneezing.

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

We'll see. stop commenting...  Again, get news? 

And mask terribly helpful helping *you*. prevent unknowingly spreading others. data nonsense. even calculate considering asymptomatic cases mild cases passed older people become symptomatic. Question 15 min tests correct? don’t require anyone flying get airport take 15 min test entering Positive go home. enclosed plane circulating air clean air covid moving covid world country  Oh yeah, 100% agreed. people need scared caring sure. say that? haven’t done well compared small island nations though. Therefore, please get meds fastracked vaccines

I bad news this. hearing reports US decided bail huge corporations investing what's leftover military police. dyslexic? "" 91-DIVOC"" fuck!  someone would turn positive, would re-do test would come back negative would say false positive,” explained one nurses. 
   nurses said hospital instructed staff take samples inside someone’s throat, send samples lab run Piedmont Hospital tests nasal swabs, knowing results would turn negative COVID-19.  
    documents filed Gwinnett Couty Superior Court, “Landmark previously attempted submit tracheal swabs lab Piedmont, samples rejected lab able perform tests types specimens.” b-b-b-but monumental anniversary!! absolutely help celebrate. doesn’t world deserve happy?! wearing mask political rest world hates trump  I'm dismissing anything, I'm staying topic.

Yes, class issues history race issues, however, context virus nothing race, class.

Making race arguing things irrelevant current state affairs. Fixing issues help pandemic happening right now.

When make things like race, open minded, detracting real topic. We're starting second wave Palestine. almost two months getting 1, 5 cases day (and two weeks without cases) lead country fully opening up, 75 new cases today. Yesterday 49. 35. day previous. protesters wholly social distancing.

Give reason go home, they'll go home. then, acknowledge judge concerns worse Covid 19. changing minds. whether certain prescription drug effective common sense ability. whether true immunity long. get common sense thing masks alot conflicting science debates things seem impossible (like hydrochloroquine time France peer reviewed studies success deemed non succesful many studies) know haven’t increased spread? would incredibly difficult calculate. Especially since many positive cases young people may asymptomatic mild symptoms. could pass older family members. Thanks reasonable thoughtful response. Legit answered questions helped understand things better.

I'm LA. People pretty good wearing masks, least area I'm in. ""We better prepared many ways, health care better prepared""

They're doomed. :/ uncle mine decided study Russia cold war live eventually left Putin-reasons always likes remind even though Russia lost cold war, least fought purely Russian minds whereas america buys/imports smart people around world make America look better is. Golf clap making public confirmation He’s become White House press intern example literally Askreddit posted tell isn’t someone trying cause division protesters, ~~censored~~, agitators, looters lowlifes going Oklahoma please understand, treated like New York, Seattle, Minneapolis. much different scene!"" remember guys, astroturfed Reddit hard 2018 elections. categorically false. Think someone spraying perfume 3 feet away probably feel fine mist. imagine spray cloth front it. particles would blocked. Wearing mask nothing protect unless n95/respirator. protect others you. Thats point everyone wearing face coverings instead going coughing, sneezing, talking spreading particles throughout. people can't understand basic concept fucking selfish care current situation. still think incorrect I'd invite let someone sneeze without wearing anything front face.  Thankfully looks changing Memphis. waiting mayor sign it. “Let virus commit genocide me!? Yeah drop sales taxes.” (Maliciously rubs hands together).

What POS  really. small island nations done well, better, Iceland. Honestly, state city turn New York situation little mitigation measures. China quarantine hundreds millions people common flu. think testing numbers 1% positive say picking up. thats gut feeling, based evidence. Somebody poopy pants. Thank Arnold! bet none idiots would dare call snowflake. Imagine retarded Ducey attempted shift pressure himself. He's clearly incompetent, might good thing. said knew 1000 people went protests none sick. I’m calling BS knowing 1000 people first place. got weird assed neurological cardiovascular symptoms 11 days ago went got tested Tuesday (I'm waiting results, hopefully today) Mom fought believe (they believe now). I'd get tested. counted positive. treat patients. I'm administrative side I'm allowed continue working home.

So, terrible, no.

But health care workers treat patients definitely undergo testing protest, wear mask, etc. Agreed, emergency flight sure expect, also load flights back front there's less congestion, ie social distancing. PGA player tested positive withdrew tournament. cancelled play on? Tell please redeeming value Cruise Line industry offers outweighs harm do? Hospitalizations deaths lagging indicators respect positive cases (~2 weeks), draw conclusion yet. looked dozen pictures BLM protest Lexington KY.  great majority protestors wearing masks, though count faces pictures. cops, wearing masks.

Does anyone number, many mask-wearing protestors diagnosed COVID?   I'm really sorry loss, hope family stay safe, I'm also Chilean difference make part. Ahh, got lot DIY projects we’ve always N95 without. concept prevalent since always stocked. 

We typically avoided wearing despite fact we’ve worn masks since beginning March. seemed mix ‘why wearing mask’ ‘why taking N95 masks away doctors’. FWIW send several packages doctors knew treating Covid patients. helped hospital limiting one day despite direct contact confirmed cases...

I get valves let unfiltered air out. wish consistency messaging wearing masks. Fair enough. reported, report make clear translation it. I've reapproved okay now. flight attendant got one shittiest jobs imagine point. fact can’t even wear mask (indonesia) mind blowing. think Florida handled worse New York, simply paying attention.

Again, wrote. said Florida handled response well. sent 4 well-documented links show, empirically, hasn't. said nothing better worse stricken American state. Florida already quarantine people coming New York (and NJ CT)

In third week March, yes. NYC terrible shape, thank making point me. Florida's outbreak bad New York wants impose quarantine. Florida handling response well, New York would imposing quarantine. Good American Airlines sticking guns fuck guy. stupid hill choose die really need start collecting data people tested, result symptoms part broader testing initiative (health care workers such). Walk away brandon, walk away honestly weird, like look picture posting something makes look like ass. many feel confident posting bullshit? really get it, claim something comment double check sources look like idiot. Yes lot times employees bend talk plastic partition, scenario it’s directly towards me. NYT paywalled. someone copy pasta? Word say protests. People likely refuse answer fear profiled. South Korea went wrong, too- people refused specify went gay clubs. specific, people refuse answer. Pretty sure that's illegal... never mind matter 99.9% sure covid (I'm supposed get test results today), I've diligently quarantining since March 1st. friends debate might gotten it. think cooking handling ton raw meat raw vegetables, friends think mother (who would asymptomatic) going social distanced coffee friends park last month. 4 bring chairs drinks sit square 6 feet apart windy park (it's always windy here). Mom Dad going get tested Monday. can't think way got it, unless maskless Instacart driver get within 3 feet scan license parents' booze. guys think? Mom's immunocompromised like me, would really surprised asymptomatic (and blood type AB) whereas Dad type would likely asymptomatic, hardly ever leave house either go stores always wear masks. put head sand all. considered said provided opinion it. hand - argument, facts, nothing creative add, say ""putting head sand."" vapid, insightless insult. expected.  kind response makes difficult discussion here. Actually go look data instead complaining sensationalized headlines questioning numbers mean.

That's continue do. one thing look data, another thing interpret it. I'm sub, threads… discuss interpretations. /u/Shoggdog one give reasonable, non dismissive response. random American, yeah f Pneumothorax would one, bad enough major problems many things taken care half year even more. hard breath instead mask face shield recommended. make immuno compromised anything, nothing preventing public rn. again, work case supposed fly recovery. Fuck. doubling basically every day, they've gone logarithmic It’s funny still haven’t answered question. So, I’ll answer you. 

It doesn’t affect me. Someone else sick doesn’t affect me. get sick, get sick. I’m going live fear. matter rude are.. everyone assuming college/NFL football season year middle rising, falling covid 19 pandemic, thats why.

Full contact game huge group people including coaching staff employees make teams. Social distance rules cannot followed game. People lung capacity issues wearing sealed masks. People severe lung capacity issues considered per case basis whether using sealed mask (such n95), unsealed mask lets unfiltered air around still burdens lungs degree, mask all.

Sometimes people weak lungs elderly may die day, people let live twilight years comfortably. Anyone wear sealed minimum unsealed masks public physical issues real problem, edge cases might physical issues. violate chain command. never communicated press, COC. someone cc: list leaked email COC. embarrassed Navy Capt paid it. real whistle-blower never came forward. die hard (no pun intended) movie fan breaks heart think film industry. social distance filming (or would super hard) venues making money closed dried up. know won’t going movie theater long time. 

I said beginning couple movies done it, release VOD (I know torrents issue this) charge 20-30 bucks, split people live with. it’s finicky, I’m single live alone? I’m paying 20$ watch movie. They’re tough spot. Norm, one liners really got weak since eighties. also anxiety demonstrated, people anxiety things want *all time,* including wearing mask. someone can't wear mask flight due anxiety, go leisure trip. emergency necessary trip reason could exceptions maybe safer place could sit plane, least away higher risk people something.  N95s, silicone respirators, full face respirators, even mil spec masks nothing keep infected person spreading virus. filter intake. free flow exhale. exhale infects multitude others. 

Now wear protect yourself, there's problem. Unless enter fully sterilized decontamination area remove really gained nothing.

It's far easier far cheaper keep virus infected masking them. problem knowing infected are. 

Btw I've used mentioned masks, worked wearing. secret slow down, maintain cardiovascular system. second wave first one never ends... Tennessee whole, yes. Nashville added 157 cases today. something consider maybe tone anxiety levels. nuclear war super volcano eruption brought civilization knees. bump road things could way worse. Things always worse.  someone employed government good way end kind list want on.

But okay part problem caused 2nd wave killed thousands people .... That's okay right ? hey name list =) Thanks hit 54k cases today. thing Brazil reached testing capacity, that's daily cases growing anymore hyper fit young people die time Covid. /s Last night said drunk, sounds like day drinking ease hangover.  Waves? make bubble. Enjoy. Check ActivArmor masks, they're comparable N95 completely reusable. physical therapy office uses couple deaf patients quite hard hearing due age. bet already flying Florida, (the air border US open), you’ll let back you’re (presumably) Canadian citizen.

Our government needs serious discussion Americans air border. manager allows us wear one N95 day.

Is manager floor you? deciding things people.

There seem ""KN95"" masks available online. idea they're good, exist. Considering article never mentioned shutdowns I'm pretty sure get baited..or chad pretending patriot. Harris county texas dropped 1.1k, holy crap Florida getting started.

We've seen before, couple months 1st cases, deaths come, people assume safe. explode cases.

I really think need re-examine RO. spread seems entirely slow 5.7, keep seeing areas initial slow rise, slower predicted bursts. Someone ask also engages unprotected sex strangers. Thanks man, death rate high too, possible explanation come mind are, availability good treatment, taking virus seriously something genes.. live Manitoba. 90% luck, 10% actual smart actions people.

First week March: one heard covid-19. 
second week March: places voluntary shutdowns. went wings buddy March 15 joked see while. Little know. Within week, pretty much everything closed. 
Third week March: government starts shutting things down. weather went shit, everyone stayed home anyway.

I think things go favor: 
Winnipeg major air transportation hub. 
No one coming Manitoba vacation March. 
People would normally go Mexico vacation, didn't. 
Iran Italy going crazy, think people would normally ""flu bros"" took bit seriously. 
We got first cases much later places, able keep control. 
The weather bad one wanted leave house anyway. 
Business saw stepped - plexiglass screens went everywhere, tape lines floor, lot mandatory. 


Who knew cold spread shitty public transportation system would one day advantage? spikes already known

most country stayed indoors watched virus ravaged NYC, etc....On e things started get control people states low cases raring go back normal, problem nobody really knew virus would affected opening.....

The assumptions summer, virus slower, teansmission methods previously assumed wrong etc....

heres guidelines go open up-

Georgia opened quick others followed suit. Case numbers were. course, still relatively low comparison, although things still open 100%.

But openings went wider, cases started rising alongside it....and  states like Florida Texas etc starting get wary.

Well. think obvious - virus still here, open infected get.

Therefore, please get meds fastracked vaccines, sacrifice right favor economy, people die result reopening strategy.

My fear going reopen instead NY spiking like hell, EVERY state spike like hell.

That would catastrophic.

So people please, pretend March, wear mask, tread lightly. aint over. Deflection blame upon others rather incompetence. leader refuses take responsibility, unfit lead. milk pasteurized, finished product not. Ice cream plants highly automated compared fish processing facilities risk probably much lower. Still, sounds like anything frozen becomes contaminated, could longer-term concern. may even impact exterior packaging frozen foods. seem know. see. think mask stock situation dire there.

Still wonder difference would make said masks important. Well, idea difficult managing stocks masks are, guess I'm limited speculation.

Oh cmiiw ""correct I'm wrong"". bad(?) habit mine keep reminding people reddit mean ill-will, hard communicate tone via text. way easy reddit think people question hostile. realize people take precautions unwanted babies, nobody forcing them. conceive one can't support one. Use protection, use birth control, abstain. Seems pretty cut dry. couldnt wait happen someone looks weird would tell : cant hit first much get near thank making act defense assault'

Perfect day There's shortage N95 masks several months now. always compare Sweden economy Denmark? neighbours doesn’t mean similar economy, it’s completely different. Also Denmark’s economy strong pharmaceutical base guess would thrive global pandemic. *guitar chords highest case fatality rate 7 nearest neighbors part plan? All-cause mortality Sweden.

Stop believing everything see *patriotic choking noises 1 person bring infected possible? takes 2 people spread virus... Seriously? it’s happening city makes article bad?

Wow! :D What's based on? Lockdowns proven states effectively put place. That's fact seen actual evidence. Fauci much intelligent person myself, theres argument there. mean everything says literal gospel factual. favorite compared wearing mask Nazi Occupied Germany. know, regiment exterminates millions based religious beliefs. I’m sure wearing mask EXACTLY like that. Chinese.

The Saudis.

The Literally-Whoeverhasmoneytoburnnows.

Do really want take western assets circumstances? allow it? excerpt: 

While words cannot always justice extent individual suffering disease, fiction sometimes offer way process present moment, feels particularly true Portuguese writer José Saramago's Blindness (1995).
The novel chronicles unprecedented epidemic blindness sweeps across unnamed country. opens one man traffic stop, world suddenly enveloped milky whiteness. taken ophthalmologist's office where, walking busy waiting room, leaves whole clinic, including doctor, infected. group quarantined old asylum ministry health. doctor wife, miraculously maintains sight, sequestered well. omabas fault Yes question.

Meaning sign new procedure place? ""choose"" monday reported every monday? Heh....imagine missed cues, subtle clues, etc. gambler making reading players....

That's *really* gonna miss plans. Many wannabe cops make cut. police department hire ended TSA. They're glorified rent-a-cops. Lol. literally nicknamed virtually everyone epidemiology world. anomaly. again, “claim” based FACTS, NUMBERS, STATISTICS, anyone’s opinion sure even bringing particular claim referring since said name. heartbreaking. thoughts go baby’s family. understand heard immunity requires least 70% population contract disease get immunized. 

So population of, keep simple, 10 million like Sweden, would need 7 million people get COVID-19.

Assuming symptomatic rate infected 50% (number vary studies) 3.5 million sick people 3.5 million without symptoms.

Assuming death rate sick people 5% - seems data shows - means 175,000 Swedes must die get heard immunity.

Still want jump heard immunity bandwagon? maybe social distancing wearing masks reduce death rate flu, 0.1% may better choice.  KSN one local news channels. pretty useless posting articles, never amount anything man: opinion! Validate me! opinion good sucks! Validate me!

Are ok? conservative activist ardent supporter President Trump barred American Airlines Thursday, one day removed flight La Guardia Airport Dallas-Fort Worth Airport refused wear passenger, Brandon Straka, recorded exchange airline employee Wednesday boarding plane shared several media video, employee referred American Airlines policy requires passengers crew members wear masks prevent spread coronavirus. policy, went effect May 11, makes exemptions children, passengers disabilities medical conditions, people eating drinking. similar policies major airline employee told Mr. Straka comply would get flight, carried 122 passengers. political journalist New York Times, Astead Herndon, sitting next seat also recorded “As result review, Mr. Straka permitted fly American, failed comply stated policy crew member instructions,” airline said. “We committed protecting safety well-being customers team members, strengthened enforcement policy required face coverings board. expect customers choose fly us comply policies, necessary, deny future travel customers refuse Earlier week, American Airlines announced stepping enforcement mask rule part broader effort trade group Airlines Mr. Straka said interview Thursday night medical condition reason didn’t wear mask. would elaborate condition said airline employee inquired telling get plane. disputed gave conflicting answers medical “My feeling airline succumbed mob mentality, which, feel, happening place country right now,” Mr. Straka Mr. Straka said flew frequently never forced wear mask. said received death threats since “I travel time,” said. “I’ve never worn mask.

Masks help, can’t believe even arguing someone. medieval times? also probably believe 5G killing us. 

Absolutely despicable 
 people would rather wear mask, able help people. Even small way, it’s right thing do. thinking invincible get family hurt reason. hope educated one day learn care others. This. I'm NYC we're still wearing masks. One thing confusing though. place undetected weren’t people dying BAM sudden thousands dropping dead starting around mid-March virtually entire globe? Excess mortality graphs country country show nothing unusual (actually often less expected deaths) March spike Republic Ireland != UK hang phone?:( literally could monkey white house would better spot now.

Well, yeah, monkey told people masks dumb pandemic overblown. Unless could talk, maybe. Good them. He’s threat passengers safety. think there’s going story like Florida girl 15 friends, it’ll friend. Apologies advance :/ imagine Tegnell. good, good job. know lot anybody else. studying forever subject.

And new virus shows use knowledge expertise find way control virus minimum amount damage economy ""normal life"". entire world screams rushes take extreme measures precaution.

Medieval measures even kid could easily put place. Lars sick, lars stays home. Easy. virus spreading? lockdown sure.
You need scientist lockdown.

I understand premise. problem gambling public health stake stubborn continue path numbers got worse norway, ireland, netherlands, france(!!!!). couldn’t opening up? Yeah. I'm good enough person take care health worry getting sick. 

Wish everyone else instead fat slobs destroyed immunity system demand wear mask protect them. Hope right Anyone tips prepare getting it? girlfriend's work bunch people test positive point I'm confident (31F) going get I'm (32M) going get her.  haha yes! people knobs. wear mask. Shift blame. Sounds right. Beat it. Yes would. people want try. hate myth can't ""our culture"". I'm American anyone wearing masks since March social distancing. heart want kill grandma. honestly think deserves attention review. It’s whole world watching terrified dumb USA handling virus. 

The fact think deaths serious shows dumb are. Keep thinking it’s serious thing lol. even can't bothered, actively avoids. ""You can't tell hang groups, I'm gonna throw secret kegger cause freedom."" heartbreaking. know solution is. think would far dead care homes allowed visitors. people would criticize government say taking care elderly, visitors spreading disease committing genocide.

I know awful, think would happen allowed visitors come? think would increase number homes outbreak think would same? think would much more. knows, maybe double number elders would die. would everyone day cruelty then?

I admit terrible, terrible choice. know percentage people SNF die year, certainly visitors increases death rate. visitors, know, might increase death rate much much more. whole point policy, right? Herd immunity. little early Twitter, Mr. President. :| comme ya thread crazy! nothing politics, people making political. It’s science, somebody points May posting CDC saying masks help, really stupid? Science evolves learn new things, upon time thought earth flat, planets revolves around earth. Guess what, science evolved know different. there’s freedom thing, sure don’t want wear mask, jail, risk public health whole. Don’t want mask, don’t ask healthcare get sick! Figure own. Grow people. Source that. know constitutes herd immunity virus, though. theoretical 1-1/R SIR model clearly overestimate. think seen proportion infected high *anywhere*, even cruise ships conditions ideal virus spread. didn’t take long 😂 Epidemiologists, Tom Frieden (former head CDC), guy tried get federal government order bunch masks February got turned down, Dr. Rick Bright demoted allowing hydroxychloraquine made widely available, researchers, doctors, health-care workers, people basic course statistics, generally people like read source material watch news clips cable TV. (Basically, everyone politicians illiterate)  *now* required? WTH? peer reviewed yet? LOL sure. totally believe Asymptomatic spread fact. Would like side Covid chicken? Found govt meeting video: wearing masks. Well living great except incompetent politicians. wonderful able walk nature people naturally socially awkward literally never approached stranger. sadly limits amount friends though It’s like “masks take away freedoms” effects personally shift “masks don’t work/fuck China creating catastrophe” $2 million? That's nothing. everyone country least $2 million dollars? 100% redditors certain December, yet cases explode March? joke. Calm dude. Ofc I'm stressed. I'm saying that, I'm stressed. Never said worse anyone else. fact people going harder times, mean can't stressed, matter little reason seems you. I'm sorry hear that. wish complete recovery. Sometimes takes bodies longer recover. good news flair talking w completely different companies. Also lot landlords rely rent money.  I'm definitely donating apartheid group. destroy lives save lives old people? make sense. risk can’t get infected don’t leave stay away people. Ew Get little corona coochie Common sense says able both! must destroy economy? written way save people bankruptcy? 

Also say anything economy OP, simply asked question concerning hospitalization wash unsure. use vinegary dressing good well. glad Arnold this. Maybe counteract Trump making statement people wearing masks saying like him.  political. love it?0.o

I hard time imagining living 20° 60° longitude..

But thats :p Nope. complain ideas contained articles. never suggest types articles unnecessary. Nice try. Ok, want cookie, or...? COVID currently issue rural areas? Oh, ‘only’ 8? hope ‘only 8’ fingers get cut today. Common sense also dictates lives saved instead economy million dollar question (sorry) do, feds succeeded keeping thousands functional masks market name trademark enforcement.  Go team! Hmmm. takes blame opening state early tourists bring out. submitted upvoted? appears 1991 article FIPV.  Completely unrelated. live Vegas too. amount people wearing masks accosting people staggering. I'm confused. decisions best made local level, conservatives?  bet every mammal, guess think unreal paying attention 5+ years. incredibly obvious guy little cares anyone besides himself.  one 87th 435? Thank you, difficulty understanding financial motivation behind this.  seem like hospital would political motivation falsify data. Yes that's one. even started eating meat first time 14years.

She working lab hospital recently written off. 

She much better work ethic me. 

Im mind you. go much tells going argue. 

We wear masks public shopping store long period time move slow climate controlled usually. 

But work I'm going asking face shields Monday. I've telling customers wear one they'd like need replace water heater I'll need remove need social distance 

Seems like good compromise someone like allready struggles breath especially summer heat.:/

Edit meet-Meat reason masks met intense pushback leadership it’s easy, cheap, effective.

He'd 'leadership' Kid Rock sucha douche bag. I'm area Michigan from. ghetto, country. rich white people. 
You're gangster fucking cowboy. Meu deus upvote HOPING you’re irony. not. You’re part problem.

EDIT. small part. got number 1 spot cases day. They're stealing gold medal!  Yeah it’s amazing support accounts broken English. I’m saying it’s magically disappearing. Influenza doesn’t magically disappear summer either. I’m saying we’re seeing could higher lull virus. come winter, could see huge surge 10x what’s happening now. Mr. Straka, privileged lunatic piece shit conservative, longer able fly American.  think masks mandatory right now. Whoever thinks otherwise idiot. question herd immunity. masks means herd immunity would not? Please stop saying shit. We're like jackasses camping Trump blow smoke asses. mean take mask become police officer? Except redcaps call increased deaths fake news. definitely thing always worried Arizona/Florida. 54k wtf? median useful here? Average makes sense. median age society probably 37. direct link. go texas tribune website. option ""Texas Case Map"" data graphs. thought couldn’t conscious ventilator? Double whammy poor lungs... Lighting (NHL) players it, too. Bullshit. increase due people spreading virus increased testing, former bigger cause. Problem thought is: it’s virus.

And yes, read rest comment, said could exceptions essential trips. Blaming brown people. Classic right wing idiocy. Lol k everyone glasses know issues fogging. they're asking is: ""why more?"" advantage getting tested you’ll know immunity you’ll allow local leaders better handle what’s going community make decisions save lives. good news serological testing coming you’ll able know antibodies.  Iirc previous articles, many players going get paid unless play. They've got bills pay too. guess black people wait another year stop killed police.

The reason lot black deaths corona systematic racism. Guess protests also pushing ? Fixing too. nah let's stay home black people keep getting killed police corona anyways cut dick completely, theres even greater chance hiv, cut tounge probaly wont get fat. neck seems bit...off. He's probably smarter That's literally dumbest view could take particular subject. Can't wait get line all-you-can-catch Covid-19 buffet September Like said it’s protecting people. you’re asymptomatic don’t wear one spread lot people wear one chances goes down. everyone wears masks there’s less chance catching it.

**Coronavirus Haiti: ""The number infections deaths vastly underestimated**

The coronavirus crisis Haiti, poorest country Americas, worrisome. 

Cases rise country testing laboratories. increase cases Dominican Republic warning factor.

- Protests Haiti better working conditions police. (7.06.2020). OP Photo

This month June 2020 crucial development coronavirus pandemic Latin America, already 70,000 deaths COVID-19. Europe begins resume activities open borders, Latin America health crisis worsening. Central America, increase cases, least 45,531 infections 1,255 deaths disease Tuesday (16 June 2020).

The World Health Organization (WHO) Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) expressed particular concern situation poorest country Americas, Haiti, number deaths 76, confirmed cases 4,441, according Johns Hopkins University figures today. Across border Dominican Republic, despite relatively early prevention measures taken government, progression pathogen increasing: 23,271 cases 605 people died.

Although official data Haiti reflect fewer infections deaths Dominican Republic, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) warns situation Caribbean country. According Sandra Lamarque, head MSF mission Haiti, increase infections Haiti basically due two factors. first lack preventive measures country. 

A strict quarantine imposed, ""would realistic measure, people go every day earn living. would good idea socio-economic point view,"" Lamarque told DW Port-au-Prince.

Haiti, country lowest per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Americas, 70 percent population living poverty must also deal shortcomings health infrastructure. ""In reality, measures announced authorities, curfew, ban meetings, applied reinforced authorities. Public places, markets, overcrowded. successful measures closure schools churches,"" explains.


**The border situation key**

The factor may large increase contagion Haiti situation border. Dominican Republic much larger outbreak coronavirus Haiti, almost 23,000 cases 590 deaths. government President Danilo Medina closed borders extended state emergency June 30.

Many Haitians returning Dominican Republic lost jobs due pandemic, caused closure hotels, restaurants, tourist services. 400-square-kilometer (250-square-mile) Dominican Republic-Haitian border officially closed Haitian government March 17, 2020, dozens unofficial crossings, large numbers people continue cross country every day, back forth, work, according Sandra Lamarque. ""The problem health controls border, isolate someone symptoms. one quarantine center entire border little chance informing people cross symptoms COVID-19,"" adds.

Dr Jean William Pape, co-chairman Haitian Multisectoral Commission Management COVID-19, told EFE 10 percent 30,000 Haitians returned DR became ill, would ""an explosive situation cannot control"". Despite scenario, Haitian government announced considering opening country's main airport, Toussaint Louverture. ""We called upon live virus therefore must think gradually resuming activities,"" said Haitian Prime Minister Joseph Jouthe.


**End Part I** May popular opinion, think probably appropriate. virus certainly still circulation growth stunted. may seeing huge drops daily case numbers rolling average slowly dropping crucially rising. 

Also worth noting difference Pillar 1 testing (in hospital) Pillar 2 (requested home tests anyone symptomatic). Pillar 1 reducing quite severely actually makes much smaller percentage case numbers. Pillar 2 staying level that’s bad thing. ONS recently predicted 4,700 cases per day, number dropping. actually seeing ability find cases better. know countries finding actual cases, actually finding good proportion them, good news, find case stop case spreading. 

Hospital admissions dropping, active cases hospital ICU dropping deaths consistently down. Last weeks excess deaths 7% 5 year average predictions last weeks (to announced Tuesday) actually show almost excess deaths. 

By means good time take foot start stupid, definitely enough evidence lower actually largely meaningless number seems relation easing lockdown. Um, ok. I'm glad BLM folks continue protest bring positive change. hope continue wear masks, need stay alive healthly vote November. Oh yeah. Disney World opening soon too. could possibly go wrong? /s family friend asking go dinner him. He's 85 3 underlying conditions. know could die natural causes covid passed, can't it. want eat sake. risk profile chart. ""for many supporters"". worries people showing protest going target. another lockdown, Mecklenburg County commissioners strongly urged residents wear face masks recent weeks slow spread coronavirus. **But could nearly three weeks** county commissioners opportunity consider mandate face Manager Dena Diorio said Friday commissioners asked official recommendation public health officials July 7 enacting mandate — similar requirements Orange Durham counties, well Raleigh. Though board public policy meeting Tuesday, commissioners typically vote meetings. July 7 meeting would first regularly scheduled meeting board would typically able vote mandate, commissioner Pat Cotham Mecklenburg towns support requirement, Diorio said. **And without consent, Mecklenburg cannot unilaterally mandate cloth face distancing levels, measured publicly available mobility data, nearly back county’s stay-at-home order went effect, Harris said.

This makes sense me. can’t create mandate without towns consenting first? Schrodingers test looking like damage people require hospitalization thought, even asymptomatic new report Scripps Research finds half people infected COVID-19 show symptoms, many could lung damage without realizing it.

?The Scripps Research report trying understand people without symptoms spread coronavirus, researchers made startling discovery.

?“Three studies I’ve looked studied asymptomatic people. Interestingly, people look feel fine, researchers CT scan image lungs, 50 100% cases, actually found abnormalities,” said Daniel Oran, Scripps Research. “When look CT scans, it’s hazy — looks like you’re looking dirty piece glass. means there’s something abnormal patients without symptoms still suffer organ damage - often silently - new study analyzing public datasets found many 45 percent people infected COVID-19, disease caused virus, never traditional signs coughing, fever shortness more, one datasets, half asymptomatic patients CT scans signs serious lung damage. that's actually bad thing, though good him. brings negativity world, doesnt even day job something positive. he's huge drain society, essentially. crazy numbers best time desperate times tend cause activity citizens.

Millions people work, economic worries compounded onto century long systemic racism corruption problems.

When people less lose fear future they're likely act. Right ask wheelchair claim I'm disabled think ask prove disability. encourages people ignore science behind Wearing Mask. 

I really think GOP “culling” herd require sustain support re-election sense. say Sally? lol  care others think masks weak ?? care them. Care you. Wear mask, keep distance, relax, sleep well, read book red wine. Relax. Really helps lot. 💪 You’re insane. Absolutely rocker. We're good.

I apologize came across hostile.

We receive lot comments non-experts telling us we're wrong 😂

My point experimentation. point caution overuse unpeered study silver bullet.

I'm one types think pharma companies able advertise TV people want dictate treatment resulted notoriously bad results.

I'm health care worker Florida Trump started promoting silver bullet, led lot public trust issues doctors would tell patients good candidates therapy.

People think we're lying POTUS said cure. argument Trump, least, providing poor leadership refusing wear mask public. Even worse, he's politicizing masks suggesting people disapprove might signal disapproval wearing mask. natural corollary, then, wearing mask could signal support Trump. You, hand, giving us spin, that's toadies do. (really) states. Online gambling allowed online poker legal states (very) limited player pool. reducing spread infected, asymptomatic otherwise

re-read sentence: answered yourself. scientific consensus: Spreading mask (even community mask) hampered (not completely stopped).

The approach reducing becoming infected droplets two-fold spreader possible victim covered.

 Assessing  credibility various estimates, conclude face masks reduce daily growth rate reported infections around 40%.

[German study city Jena, started using masks everyone else Germany](http://ftp.iza.org/dp13319.pdf) Texas can’t turn NYC don’t near population density. place America turn NYC. New York State 10,000 cases first test. thousands cases getting crowded subways everyday. 

What Texas do, seems intent doing, far deaths have. don’t know state would kill citizens policy choice. real trouble country. Florida must bad - Tampa Bay players infected too. hate cultures much? might even worse?

My point still don’t know lot cannot assume things won’t get worse. like one...in Ohio ""Click Ticket"" seatbelts.

The Corona version ""Mask Casket"" kind strawmen bs this? course everyone would prefer get vaccine one yet year lockdown practical masks current preventative measure. (really) states. Online gambling allowed online poker legal states (very) limited player pool. Fuck man, sorry hear loss, pulling ya.

This whole thing like slow boil horrorshow, really hope get side soon. pneumonia death test Herd impunity Wow... ""There mutiny""

Suddenly he's Captain plane??? party 50 Alajuelita, infected people party. 20 people infected. Yes. lockdowns first time crowds. 

They mild symptoms. conservative disregard towards others health. I'm also spectrum (high functioning well) understand that, find masks uncomfortable well (but wear one go out). median age Florida overall 42, bit younger. $1,000 parts Texas governor chopped mayors nuts collectively Yes, following CDC guidelines succumbing mob mentality. 🤦🏻‍♀️ can’t govern resign likely Thank providing source. But, additional thing consider antibodies, though great, actually sign long term immunity. Longer term immunity governed T-cells, cells create antibodies. cells create antibodies store 'recipe'for antibody, even infection gone, antibodies created demand if/when reinfection occurs. Essentially, antibodies may go away, long T-cells generated infected vaccinated individual, long lasting immunity obtained. SARS-CoV-1, another coronavirus, immunity 10 years, link source momentarily. NJ month. can’t go stores without mask I’ve impressed people complying. businesses pickle. Karen's fuck right whining mochas. Also, police would ones enforcing restrictions population. relationship law enforcement Americans rn strained say least. transmit others, people choose ignore Yup! Watch 👏 👏they 👏respond👏 Real smart opening early. Jesus 3 weeks ago... Probably. still take precautions, though. Nothing suspicious - trusting herd immune facts... Well surefire way fix via social media. One 2020 resolutions (one pandemic thrown wrench into) start journaling. 10 days entries January sick like 20 years. going doctor testing negative flu. wife coming same. kids seem avoided somehow seems really unrealistic since wife sick time somebody prepare food. Feels like maybe go get antibody test. right, case goes ways. 

Willful ignorance virus amongst us leading carelessness, willful ignorance science virus leading irrational panic negativity-both fueled irresponsible press sides. Rogan always struck guy average intelligence thinks he's bit smarter everyone else. He's super egotistical though he's got popularity. seems relatable given way talks. Dude, entire post history full anger. love airline websites phone lines buy ticket, say wear mask. think missed part Oh, god. heard since day 1 states locking down. No, supposed hide bubbles rest lives keep crippling economies. However, way people going public obviously sustainable economy, either. look Arizona restaurants casinos already closing reopened employees getting sick/dying. Masks need mandatory. needs better sanitization, better social distancing policies. mean, can't find solution ""Shut down!!"" ""I get walk around spreading virus wherever whoever fucking want!!""??? I'm really worried upcoming school year, older staff schools. I'm worried fall season sports holidays huge get togethers families, friends, coworkers. really think going shit show, place called Denial, friend. nice. Thank much sane voice American people. Trump saying mask wearers “are him” people don’t wear mask “support him”. floored making American personal safety partisan issue year reelection. I’d much rather run president (I wish could). idol mine since 4 mom let watch T2 first R movie I’ve watching everything social media, great guy. 

With Administration giving 0 guidance (and guidance gave ignored, notably governor, Greg Abbott) lying American public again, trying make issues country partisan issues, silencing/ignoring scientists tell lives lost continue way. supposedly “greatest country world” pandemic many countries controlling spreading like wildfire America stunts Trump pulling. 1200 American public 5 months? wasn’t working I’d homeless. wish level headed person, much like yourself, could president horrible catastrophe.

Also, thanks GF I’m going pescatarian moving vegan eventually, I’ve never felt good! also take account unreliability antibody testing. Plus fact exposed think exposed likely get tested, necessarily represent population whole. NYC would lucky 20% overall. walk staying 6+ feet away others, wear mask. recreational activities like jogging biking. Boo hoo, truth even make cry little one. Read article. Here's what's happening allowed certain businesses reopen May 4, announced highest single-day count Thursday since pandemic began, according data released Florida Department Health. percentage people testing positive hit new peak 10.18% Tuesday, falling 9% Wednesday, according new data state health department.


This argument makes sense percent tests coming back positive decreases dramatically. /u/potroast1251 mentioned, there's also record increases hospitalization. increased testing.

These governors lying killing people. American lives doesn’t matter even though many yelling black lives matter. Florida hit five digits day? hope not, they’ve proven us right thus far. really think didnt think care.. still needs use arms persons wishing board Garuda flight must present health certificate demonstrates infected virus. health certificate must either rapid test taken within three days travel PCR swab test taken within seven days.

That's bit context makes little reasonable. South shall rise again!!!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

**YEEEEEEEEHAWWWW!!!!!** California ads, least Bay Area. Seriously, wear mother fucking mask. want Arnold punch Joe Rogan face. 2023* make clear mask. Dumbasses wearing mask.

If want keep businesses open restore economy, main priority keeping disease bay
 exactly person advocating wearing masks. working self interest... Canada banned inter-provincial non essential travel, inter provincial travel requires 2 week quarantine, definitely helped keep less populated provinces hit hard travelers. r/nottheonion Sweden, US, Brazil UK learn, edit, iterate progress homies. gonna drive LA cause it’s ridiculously cheap drive. Plus got time always wear face mask think pretty clear numbers nonsense.

Just look populations died illness. Fully half long-term care facilities, despite fact people make 0.6% population. average age death older average life expectancy.

Death counts falling floor places like Wisconsin Indiana reopen despite fact think they're near 70% population infected (though likely someplace like California).

I really understand point continuing push fantasy numbers. They're realistic.

As bonus, here's twitter thread noted expert Peter Hotez getting called for, use technical term, making shit up, order get kind exponential case counts would need get anywhere close kind infection rates (nevermind way lower fatality rates people long-term care facilities) -  Maybe rate death going down. That's great! However, doesnt mean infection is. carriers may asymptomatic good amount cases, can't pretend virus causing irreversible damage organs symptomatic carriers become lax it. Americans already running around herds they're bored virus. irresponsible.

Lack testing (again) lead even higher infection rate. state county, we've already seen testing numbers drop reopen. many people going restaraunts, stores, parks, etc asymptomatic? And, result, many contract virus?

Phases reopening based mass testing, tracking, isolation. Without testing available, goes window. Conversely, dog-piling people research think moronic rejecting experts advise hand. problem dogmatization science deification experts intermediaries people truth way church intermediary people truth days Galileo. fortunate enough able research comprehend scientific concepts prevented shamed it! need balance, experts respected treated infallible demigods. said swim atlantic... yoi really mean swedish atlantic that?o.0

xD final goal purer immune herd fine apparently... lying data. positivity rate rapidly increasing, meaning whether tested numbers would skyrocket. accelerating widespread community transmission inpossible deny. 

Would explain 1000 new people week Texas showed really sick hospital testing?? make awful lot claims nothing back up. article sums situation Dr. Ioannidis quite nicely. study guess you’re referring (which nothing Arizona’s numbers Lombardy’s I’m sure you’re bringing assume that’s haven’t yet linked it: know it’s topic) widely regarded extremely weak methodology, coming completely incorrect conclusions puts people risk spreads misinformation. managed lose decades worth respect months. people think opinion worth anything basically Fox News. opinion based data whatsoever. 


I guess see keep arguing Arizona numbers bad Lombardy, even though do... you’re board Ioannidis’s way approaching this, don’t care data going whatever narrative fits would like true. Good luck that.  people wear mask. That’s bullshit. San Antonio one wearing mask Idiocracy. Customer service trump customer safety, draw smile mask that's takes. fyi little evidence air recirculation covid. know airborne health settings aerosol producing health procedures doubt gonna surge, short blips R number 1 dangerous. protestors went home followed rules &amp; protests infections rise point worried :) sub obsessed Sweden? afraid of? Looking stupid? small price pay save life. simple staying home. get perfectly healthy person sick unwittingly pass someone danger. *is* chance anyone dying. afraid. ignorant. smart protect others. protestors done better job wearing masks locals tourists. Excellent comeback. reminds Joe Rogan's stance masks Bill Burr shut down. would u go NY ew. [They're still fucking declaring officials pointing ""aggressive testing"" strategy state, DeSantis noted health officials made testing available every resident long-term care facility well employees work allowed certain businesses reopen May 4, announced highest single-day count Thursday since pandemic began, according data released Florida Department Health. percentage people testing positive hit new peak 10.18% Tuesday, falling 9% Wednesday, according new data state health department. smiling eyes would shown it. tests available, longer restriction get test actively testing higher risk areas now. course cases. Deaths aren’t skyrocketing. goalpost moving keep trying prove reopening bad idea. wasn’t. Extended lockdowns ridiculous solution reason people clinging hard. Wow...they're pretty serious attention detail too.

I suspect probably came server it....hard tell much article. means he's cheaper bribe Good. airlines need follow suit. Let fucking plague rat drive everywhere, needs get Europe, take ship. Yeah, really do. destroy economy save people honestly need outside really sick.

Wearing mask simple thing help keep everyone safe keep economy running. 

The last thing want another wave cause another shut down, something simple masks help prevent that.

I’m attack insult (like lot people reddit tend dispute something) help understand won’t wear mask better understanding position. could get trumpers go testing would somewhat comparative study large indoor gathering rally. wouldn’t regionally isolated though, plenty followers probably coming locations. Ha, Texas problems accumulating cases way protests Source? mask stylish, feel confident without ppl look ugly mug!

Join feel like cyberpunk ;)

Hey ugly face know least foreskin like pump action shot gun.

Someone pass cheesecake I'm starving. That’s great news. Rate still low achieving herd immunity within schedule... .....They keep talking ""second wave"" virus. Seriously? live cases never leveled off, keep climbing part areas testing available. think area crossed ""the first wave"" fucking idiots-----this virus hasnt slowed bit spread. can't begin fathom level ignorance arrogance must think opinion synonymous collective knowledge acquired people dedicate lives research.

You can't even read academic article usefully, stop acting like parroting echo chamber tells you. That's exact reason helping things? pretty well known air conditioning spreads virus around way people outside. would help people outside, people want sit indoors restaurants go shopping. technically Arizona's ""winter"" compared seasonal states many people indoors. build field hospitals want. mean shit enough staff staff them. FL fucked. Well nickname liltrump reason lol swedish chance?xD Leave amoeba said prepare. Send hospital ships never used NY, question? You’re lied you’re blind Muh freedumbs! Hate won’t save fellow Indians virus.  probably practice sheeple Sweden made big risky bet lost. Besides school thing already mentioned, there's also less Vitamin producing sunlight, Vitamin deficiency seems linked serious outcomes.

Also temperatures start drop again, shown summer heat stop virus, ""Each additional 1.8-degree temperature increase level associated additional 3.1 percent reduction virus’s reproduction number, called R0""

Source: colder, people spending time inside outside, inside much easier spread virus outside. seems like typical, soft power Chinese Communists tactic. first epicenter, new anti-Chinese sentiment likely sponsor academic study deflect blame towards them. crime?

You can't interpret economic social situation African American community vacuum without considering broader history racism America. know centuries research important type wealth generational wealth, assets pass one generation another. opportunities today parents opportunities had, turn success life without success grandparents, etc.

 

Consider economic plight average African American family America. slavery abolished, reparations. forty acres mule. education system willing able accommodate African American children, say nothing illiterate adults. exception brief moment Reconstruction, significant force dedicated upholding safety political rights African Americans. wonder sharecropping became ubiquitous system labor? many freed slaves, quickly wound working masters again, little changes day day lives. this, white America profiting work black America, plundering property labor. slavery abolished, lucrative field American manufacturing combined, including new railroad. American industrial revolution/rise big business already booming, overshadowed obscene wealth plantation slavery. 1860, one four Southern Americans owned slave. Many southern states majority black, 70% black certain counties home state Virginia, vast majority unfree laborers. Mississippi South Carolina majority black. There's reason South able pay debts Revolution quickly. consider essential black uncompensated labor country, exaggeration say slaves built America.

 

From moment onewards til 1960s, racism law land. Sharecropping slavery another name ""separate equal"" offense human rights, two institutions alone created massive opportunity gap continued repercussions today. people consider extent American government empowered people create acquire wealth time, extent denied black Americans chances. ""Homestead Act"" black people, instance. FDR signed Social Security Act, specifically endorsed provision denied SS benefits laborers worked ""in house field,"" creating social security net NAACP described ""a sieve holes big enough majority Negroes fall through.” Black families paid far white counterparts trying support past generations instead investing future. Great Depression, elder poverty 50%. Consider top expensive poor, especially black. son gets sick white buy insurance, set back deductible copay. black shut insurance market, may burn life savings care still find good doctor willing help black patient. idea poor socially disadvantaged vulnerable called exploitation theory, really important understanding race America.

 

Nowhere exploitation theory important housing. obvious desegregation never platform nation embraced wholeheartedly, extent segregation manifestation formal policy something often gets forgotten. home important piece wealth American history, consider home ownership prospects African Americans instantly understand vital essential past remains interpreting present comes race.

 

During 1930s, America established FHA, agency dedicated evaluating worth property helping Americans afford homes. FHA pioneered policy called ""redlining,"" worth piece property tied racial diversity neighborhood, diversity driving price. white homeowners complained colored neighbors drove prices, speaking literally. addition, FHA banks used ratings (which them, less) resolved give loan black family would increase racial diversity neighborhood (in practice barrier proof high virtually black families received financial aid purchasing home). practices end 1968, damage done. 1930, 30% Americans owned homes. 1960, 60% did, largely FHA lending practices presence market enabled.

 

Black families, cut new American housing market government guarantees made possible, nowhere go. taking place Great Migration. Black families fleeing old plantation estates still treated like slaves, traveling North search better life. arrived, nowhere live. White real estate owners quickly realized exploit vulnerability black community. bought property sold homes African American families ""on contract."" contracts overpriced, could afford keep homes. make matters worse, contracts routinely broken. Often contracts guaranteed heating bills, amenities would never covered. Even though black families ""bought"" houses, contract like mortgage-- little expectation future ownership. owners contract houses would loan property, wait payments cease, evict family, open house next gullible buyer fleeing lynching south. None mattered. 1962, 85% black homeowners Chicago lived contract homes. numbers comparable cities across country. every family could keep holding onto property til practices outlawed, dozen spent life savings elusive dream home ownership would never come fruition.

 

This practice exploiting African Americans sell estate real consequences. black contract buyers streamed neighborhood, FHA took notice. addition racist opposition integration white homeowners, even well-intentioned difficulty staying neighborhood value house went down. could take loan pay daughter's college finance business collateral low-value piece land? White flight something U.S. government wash hands of. social engineering, upheld government policy. white families left neighborhoods, contract buyers bought houses fraction cost expanded operation, selling houses contract finally selling real estate federal government government moved public housing, virtually ensuring public housing would help black families move neighborhoods opportunity. FHA's policies also helped whites: without sterling credit ratings businessmen lily-white communities could buy at, would modern suburb. remains today. map neighborhoods contract buyers active map modern ghettos, get near-perfect match. Ritzy white neighborhoods became majority-black ghettos overnight.

 

There's certain type neighborhood that's known ""nexus concentrated poverty,"" space poverty default state certain aspects economic social life begin break down. level disputed, purposes census U.S. government defines concentrated poverty 40% residents living poverty line. level, everything ceases function. Schools, funded taxpayer dollars, cannot deliver good education. Families, sustained economic opportunity, cannot stay together. Citizens, turned productive members society ties economic well-being society, turn crime social disorder. America today, 4% white adults grown neighborhoods. 62% black adults raised them.

You right note certain facets black society: drug use, family anarchy, etc imaginary, though certainly policed fairly represented honestly white American consciousness. symptoms, causes black poverty. Go spaces concentrated white poverty, find similar statistics. reason black society way black families systemically cut normal avenues upward mobility, white supremacy saggy jeans rap music. Cause difficult breath? mean still wear mask properly. came mind Maybe laughing you’re username

(Seriously tho, stay safe Gl) Yes factor 55 99.6% chance fine close 60% even developing real symptoms. overall percentage requiring hospitalization low. statistics opinion don’t get made me. 

Yes death tragic, arguing either. data showing 65+ 6% mortality rate, 65 it’s around .5%. 

Cases go go up, don’t get either vaccine herd immunity. real options. like mask rule means part idiots catch Covid saying took pregnancy test doesn’t mean wasn’t pregnant before.  job literally based science statistics, I'd hope he'd something back claim. Frustration fear Kid, even COVID 19 test kits India produced based virus sequences released CCP scientists. virus woke? Desperate people desperate things. Permanently banning versus refusing grant entry...? psychos advocating culling, much likely get human cat. even know confirmed cat human transmission. There's way culling OK, especially given people even taking virus seriously anymore. know said ""probably"", I'm arguing. scary still: ""Activist"" way civil term twats Paywall disregard human life noted, seen despicable (as you) karma get end. Bad day. Unless really caused 4Gs.

Biggy, Snoop, Tupac Rick Ross.... MN protests, nothing compared population size NYC Los Angeles Chicago. getting data from? much? I'll buy it, anchor together international water. start new floating country. two law system, Law 1- hurt people. Law 2- take people's stuff. King anything says based on? demand source opinion Fauci, need demand sources facts everything says recommends. fact, need demand source everything that's coming covid days. demands sources facts/opinions sound dubious you. Demand everything clear picture what's going on, rather slanted, biased view - ie., content sub. harmless question someone trying help, need dick Well, haven’t heard upticks around here, way people around here, came lot people would end op getting sick. Americans care little other, I've heard complaints shutting suspending football season I've heard negligent state federal governments been.

The US lost people pandemic we've lost many wars, 9/11, Benghazi. Every single one huge scandals.

No one seems care deaths. weird thing California deaths somewhat constant since mid-April cases continuously increased. matter deaths lagging indicator, we'd seeing increase deaths now. real question what's different.  Ohh that's why!
It weird jump straight monday. insurance companies arguing can't pay everyone who's concerned ~~risk get tested~~ health.

FTFY

With approach NEVER going able successfully reopen health standpoint repeated testing, seemingly healthy people, required. way reopening *supposed* work massive testing, contract tracing, targeted quarantines. much angry strategy furious doubling saying worked...

All say(and leave guilt give condolences love) locked like everyone else slowly opened like everyone else... 

5000 deaths vs 500 ok burden side...

Hold swedes Kinda like contact tracing New York explicitly doesnt ask protests recently? mean gods exists makes 100% sense really.

 Florida man mistake would rather forget, less said Arizona better! forego experiments obedient herd? A-team? Versus 100,000 insignificant. Many sources put herd immunity reached much lower percentage population 

Heres one example death rate 5% among sick people, wtf. simple look countries covid cases tell that. Please dont spread misinformation. agree might machismo involved lot lower income Hispanics cannot afford it. majority Hispanics work service industries hit hardest pandemic. can’t afford masks lot lower income Hispanics live really tight conditions renting rooms. There’s space social distancing them. also use public transportation others. know that. referring outliers.

I always needed 8-9 hours sleep. would give anything one hour day. body robust immune system fought coronavirus without showing (or few) symptoms, highly likely would encounter again. Antibodies measure immunity. ""You stupid!""...""No, stupid!!"" come Reddit, nothing like grade school insults bring back memories. T-cells right make get reinfected, stop posting scaremongering bullshit Decreasing daily deaths numbers don’t lie... began murdered Harambe. going enforce this? authority figures brainwashed Trump! think stupid business names would tipped scammers - Go4WorldBusiness EnergyFundz.  

Really? sound suspicious all? Vietnam new internal case like 62 days. Lots people repatriating it, news every days. think Vietnam stay closed stay safe. Well fair, half us dumb af Wtf? That’s considering excess mortality wasting time.

The number people willing comment without even basic number relatively easy get (like cause mortality Sweden vs Nordic neighbors) staggering. link proof statement don’t protect you?

And contagious several days showing symptoms, know stay home contagious aren’t yet showing symptoms? think backlash schedule full, time day that. hate coronavirus. No, I'm *in* hate coronavirus. caused much pain turmoil world trying die. like rest us.. Gotta love Finland! Feeling sad can't relax cold long drink sauna dip cool baltic sea summer. Pour one Fins! mean remain mean, outliers exist. holiday weekend Sweden, sign one-off thing. article exactly say Mondays on, right? don’t know. makes sense me. testing way Texas obviously find cases. Right? self-swab someone else swab you?  There’s definitely brigading going thread. responses people actually know they’re taking downvoted? Memory B/plasma cells don’t go away serum antibodies drop. would say side. 

This important understand people sides think feel way do. Writing ignorant delusional makes divide bigger. Movie theaters enjoyable anymore, even coronavirus. Parents bring kids movies let run wild, example. one guy won’t put phone away.

Going movies isn’t experience anymore, it’s chore.  Well thats line decided on, sticking can't. bad CNN article repeats lies, rather point example Florida, increased testing percentage tests coming back positive would going down, is. 

I suspect breaking point TV cameras show grandma dead hallway ICU's full. Yeah, vaccinated can't catch it. probably make vaccine pets too. ask?
Because answer previous question.

It's clear understand different activities carry different risks. indoor rally, without masks, likely spread virus outdoor activities masks. friends mine started website allows view airports open allowing travel COVID-19, feel free give look! Useful! long? death rate we've would take 35 years. hope kidding, dude.

The kind person who'd yell wearing mask could emotionally unstable probably higher average chance carrying concealed firearm. Soon saying it’s “fading away.” let get list straight. pandemic, can't stressed out, can't cultivate meat consumption shut economy. almost seems like virus specifically designed save us self imposed extinction Yes, course want that.

They care public health risks public endure.  sounds like great movie although problem much Japanese nature.

I feel like Godzilla would stomping white house Trump would screaming Nancy Pelosi would remaining calm subway re-routing thing, Bernie Sanders yelling young people vote.

We fucked. won’t find 5G microchip plans, hidden away elsewhere... clarify, it'll hard NFL season without tons people getting sick. It'll easy season It’s spread first. it’s third fourth generation first notice outbreak. support you, reasons think. really. Maybe 1 500 protesters disease, lot masks outdoors moving around.

It vastly dangerous bar church COVID positive outside them. people known infected outdoors all. keep hearing don’t believe it. Ontario Canada last month increased testing quite bit numbers keep going down. think needs seen.  mean spread windy sunny hot beach seems little less dangerous 50,000 people packed streets marching shouting things constantly no? probably go him, want live. Lots younger people fucked and/or killed virus. US. Winning sore losing. I, too, dodge mask-wearing ninja assassins about. They’d delusional. don’t test, don’t cases right? I’m Phoenix. It’s gonna hot hell next months. people don’t go outside much time year anyways, hopefully helps things. know what? Fine. hoping theaters would stick around even though I’m fan much myself, want pull shit go. hope studios pull Trolls World Tour movies time goes on. love London though must say.

Hell town. Want borders open life normal. Definitely cookie. Countries beating virus back world over. Really want happen US Brazil. ‘Spare expense’, ‘overturn every stone’ worst enemy humanity lifetimes, far 2020.... can’t speak future. Haha I’m moving back later year. Deep dish really awful. worth it. Tavern style pizza tho 👍🏽 get news poorly cropped image macros Russia Today omit source author. like getting knocked blaming taking pregnancy test. Key word “in development”. could development means might take long time covid vaccine link that. googled could find anything support statement. man, looks, treats others? Surely latter. Surely taking others health seriously manly. Claims contrary certainly naive immature. Yaaarrr... look! reply! article states. mean IL. Cook county county includes Chicago. got hit fairly hard (86,000 cases) things looking better numbers seem really falling, point planning hitting one patios drink next couple weeks (we started allow bars serve drinks outdoor patios week looking forward getting one). Even though disagree outlook people, I’m going ask please wear mask grandmother yoga, doesn’t drink smoke yoga everyday, still risk age.
Wear mask best friend type 1, genetic diabetes risk fault own. 
Wear mask also eats right, works out, doesn’t smoke takes care myself, put college who’s company doesn’t offer paid time coronavirus. able work forced take time would detrimental paying bills that’s financially responsible possible. 

Don’t think wearing mask protecting people don’t care about, think protecting people care risk fault own. first re-read article understand. 

Hint: 5k per million 5k per million 10 million 5k per million 300 million well. talked COVID virus loves place. Lots touching feeling, pretty girls, old overweight men, close contact etc. virus sure loves more, strip clubs, gyms, meat packing, restaurants. great virus plans keep visiting good time. enjoying time America loves hospitality, especially south. enforced fines. wont work also highly doubt sane.  sure...totally. ""nothing see here... move along."" attitude basically... stop asking questions, told. subreddit pure gaslighting. Almost perfect natural virus...  Well, even pandemic, hopefully things get back least semi-normal. swine flu pandemic lasted 19 months August 2010. Hopefully masks gone then. got like prioritized military industrial complex, ENORMOUS tax cuts billionaires corporations, destruction organized labor guise jingoistic pablum like ""self reliance"" ""the American dream"", paid shit annihilating public education, letting infrastructure go rot, allowing businesses reap profits increased worker productivity, well complete erosion new deal policies made America economic force.

Now got working class undereducated, unhealthy, poorer ever, wealthy fucking country. there's nothing it. good news Enough slow spread, full immunity 987 cases COVID SC today McMaster cares opening economy again. go groceries 30% population town wearing masks. It’s ridiculous. actually communications degree, may actually understood messages scientific community.

You clearly read science journalism think gonna case. People boycott already Cosco - think people sub enjoying virus Covid 19 yer dirtz Good know we’ll least alive then... think people sub actually finished degree? I'd say 3/4 wearing masks, outdoors

Harm reduction elimination can't compare saying home. Even virus spread. protesters young seemingly healthy adults.

Who pass virus older relatvies. people need haircuts /s It’s like boil frog slow, throw hot water jumps out, increase daily cases frog cookie itself.  I'm avid movie-goer real stake this. gave upvote want respectfully pose, think fair amount moviegoers antibodies then? I'm saying would smart, whole families virus tested positive (assuming know bit antibodies resilience then), concerned catching again, course everyone else theater knows possibility virus there. Top scientist? person fired charge dashboard data scientist. president led example. Oh said president three months ago. absolute cluster fuck situation. understand narrative. Ok, experts wrong oooohhhh one chance get right. Now, face glaring scientific evidence countries one regarding mask use, let's mitigate risk cut transmission?

The experts wrong, let's stupid idiots?

I think people wearing masks using whole 'the experts lied already' people predominantly going wear anyway. way thinking shows unable accept new evidence lack capacity critical thinking own. sit circle jerks blaming experts want ignoring glaring mistakes top officials states country lied openly corrupt put shortsighted thinking regarding prioritization economy lives full display.

You know else one chance get right? lockdown / quarantine. Let's keep eyes numbers Trump's rally Tulsa. live California probably continue cut corners bare minimum. Grocery stores big box stores comply sure expect see people trying get away much non-mask wearing can. No, stupid people problem US. I'm somewhat cheered younger people catching on. help people trust science they're lied scientific experts. [This NZ doesn’t zero cases anymore. Good luck enforcing that... pulled smoothie King first time months found required wear masks employers. already swiped card time realized asked refund cancel order proceeded ask prerogative choosing eat wear gloves. wearing mask drive thru held soap. work outside day first restaurant found enforcing masks. response made livid. incredibly detailed bullshit sounding thing sadly backup full confidence. Congratulations, won. Currently Stow 50/50 people wearing ages.  plan:

Don't. Well I’m glad area well. Hopefully area keep flat curve speak. Really comes every citizen United States wanting beat virus takes common sense. Wear mask social distancing can’t avoided. Wash hands often stay home people feel weather. every American would we’d chance beating this. sad truth lot people don’t care think they’re invincible illness. person young healthy horse doesn’t mean can’t end ventilator die this. could get people open eyes maybe need accurate news reporting one day coronavirus government giving us information one day back peddling information released next day can’t even agree comes preventative measures really gives especially young people mind set must bad. I’ll okay. used country people wanted come too. Right definitely laughing stock countries. government can’t even get together. sides isle could nation possibly think people could get together. government needs start getting together working one instead opposite sides isle especially Pandemic give accurate information really tell people you’re invincible this. don’t care health know care least one person life wear mask you’d want others wear mask around vulnerable individual family. Right uniting one. Instead country going opposite direction. Purely sad. country beautiful could great government would get act together us citizens worked one united entity, unfortunately never happen wishful thinking. ""Hey MISTER SCIENTIST ... take kindly kind round here!"" thoughts prayers then? real world, often difficult talk parents intentionally destroying relationship kids. article makes mention protestor, wore mask, pre existing conditons, insurance anything along lines.

So sure comment relates accomplished young woman sadly passed away. due start second job day closed everything down. watched states close knew inevitable state would well. Without family help would screwed. get unemployment approved six weeks initially applied. call BS state religion anti-science idiots belong to? proud governor taken shit tons grief white house armed protesters state house jerk street Impeach Whitmer sign yard BiL sister want defeat next election.

That friends call LEADERSHIP! what's right even whole damn world let chips fall may! sure shit hope get caner something while. It’s selfishness pure simple USA! USA! 🇺🇸 Cnn? LOL Covid-HIV-27 bursts onto scene... Scott would handle pandemic much better though. know loves tell Trump go fuck off. welll...it would sort make sense....if healthy, pro-biotic healthy guts......but dead-belly country?  nah, dont trust white bread sugar-syrup sandwich belly-systems lie. ""The cause death yet known. Tests confirmed child Covid-19, yet clear contributing factor."" [Source: Covid sniffing dogs new band name Sounds appealing yet scary right hahaha times weird  also help long history using bad science silence control population. war drugs, oil companies hiding evidence related global warming, etc. That’s nice way saying “stupid people”. Yeah man! last trip Alabama November remember seeing 3 plates Hawaii. Tallahassee places like it’ll strictly enforced here. fuck can’t people wear mask? 40 cases COVID found Beijing shut city down. Doesn’t scream emergency? Americans die pride. hope country survives shit. Can't open economy workers get sick actually cant want work. Easy! God created universe light already remote source already motion.

God wants us believe faith, see, makes look like universe older is. top 0.01% really count don’t care... Wait, Covid-19 100% fatality rate? say anything taking precautions, governor announced testing nursing home patients recently. I'm sure others got tested along way without tests can't diagnose cases.

Edit : looked back, requiring residents tested even now. That's way behind states. Even staff testing ordered every two weeks even lowly Tennessee already testing staff every five days. Proving ""Cares Act"" stimulus - never designated bill. I'm epidemiologist feel deeply get double lung transplant? I'm sure new salon ladies lining wear masks Yeah, made worst lying masks.

The problem anti science, thing people earned distrust towards states figures cause.

When go blatantly admit lied people saying masks doesnt work needed somewhere else put massive cloud head. would better didnt lie endangering people lives said mask work needed front line availability problem sorted out. shame need legislate compassion self preservation.  state could make national headlines good news incredibly stubborn. state this. Why. FFS GO

BC FINE sure people are? feel like blown proportion. live redneck, bible belt America everyone local wal-mart, including stereotypical fat overweight people scooters, wearing masks. Matter factly, look wierd don't. small businesses require mask entry almost every job interacting public wearing masks. Every employee wal-mart, target, home depot, etc. Exponential growth 4 week lag hospitalization. make sense Even best case, enough vaccine get woods 21.  That's ok though gone easter.

I've several protests live major city. I'd say 3/4 wearing masks, outdoors (which seems help significantly), protesters young seemingly healthy adults.

Trump rallies indoor events chock full obese boomers overwhelmingly defiant wearing masks.

I'm sure infections happened protests, looking comparatively, think know scenario gonna way infections, hospitalizations deaths. America. bad flu season. would easy overlook, flu definitely present. still cough assume flu December, tho I'm getting curious myself. bills make uninsured millionaire go bankrupt

Lol... millionaire health insurance... lets trump lightly. Leadership situations down. led. dismissed, made light of, pretended go away. message sent everyone. wonder things bad.

He also dismantled many institutions designed respond sort thing. general, stuff filling positions Whitehouse? sacking competent people replacing yes-men cronies? Well impact. US govt dysfunctional top level throughout Whitehouse created chaos dysfunction. He’s filled positions people don’t know use tools government make things happen, don’t really believe so. sacked people know they’re - left accord couldn’t bear see whole thing tumbling around them, couldn’t bear support awful administration.

Things happen people make happen. corporate knowledge experience “government” lots people squirrelled rooms know make things happen. Many people gone replaced incompetents.

This top disaster, Trump cherry top, whole cake cake shop. see above. Honey, I'm ""retirement age"" except many us work die. great many years future obtain skills, especially family history. take dirt nap, still eat. bootstraps wore decade ago. troubles sooner later concerns young. thanks.  Well 2 deaths isn’t bad. mean obviously condolences families number low think pretty obviously kind thing person talking about. understand that.

However Sun.

They history like British tabloid rags.

Irish achievements, especially sport become “Ireland UK achievements” sudden. Bad bot. Yeah, profession outright ignored! sympathy. always find strange Hollywood movies actual, rational sounding science usually shunned, hero story usually pariah irrational/fringe position turns correct (against odds) Holy fuck like... even science particularly. BG simply noticed lack systems place working similar field bit.

Imagine toilet cleaner overseas, people come saying oh man blocked need plunger. coming home seeing country plungers. say ""hey ever get blocked fucked without plunger"".

Well shits everywhere people saying caused it. instead dumbfucks saying “I don’t wanna wear mask” like angry 3 year old.

Not mention astroturfing campaigns social media dedicated spreading misinformation &amp; trying undermine work scientists &amp; doctors pushing restrictions. I’m Hoboken there’s ton brave, mask-less freedom fighters here. depends behaved. protests family members went would spread anyone. personally believe conspiracy versions. there's plenty good science happening. also believe everyone dependent government funding incentivized support government construct. Going government construct threatens livelihood right existence. believe factor exists.

Then also there's replication crisis basically proves shitload research happening name science. often happening reasons. Uh oh, Fauci get fired .... say stupidity problem US. It’s 2020 man, everybody knows Earth flat! fair, based MERs Vaccine like started scratch. hospitals already doing. ICU nurses taking 2 6+ patients trying manage number step nurses take good chunk cares ICU nurses manage ICU specific stuff. 

It works kind non-ICU nurses training experience know always do. ICU nurse readily available (because managing way patients normal ICU resource nurses) things get bad pretty quick. 

This quality care fall dramatically. run kind surge manner different combinations nurses different patient situations/acuity. indefinitely. mistakes deaths result this. Fox News.
Too much religion science.
Donald Trump.
No universal healthcare.

Start fixing things maybe many anti-science idiots. Disagree. say let Florida burn. said want, get it. dead stacked like firewood Cost Freedom™ Floridian fully expected new cases stay-at-home order ended, growth rate right terrifying. don’t know another shutdown, people really need realize Covid-19 still real threat Always. Too. Late. Realistically, could catch tomorrow quarantined. stockpile shelf stable frozen stuff, buy eat weekly normal, rotating stockpile. Yeah it’s definitely media who’s blame distrust scientists, completely. clickbait headlines written ad impressions revenues. :/ DURRRRRRRRRR possibly average 7 14 days

Where getting duration data from? Thanks. Man, people find first breakthrough treatment Covid generic drug, made tens thousands labs around world, costs like $.20 per dose entire world going fall apart. Idk they’re going cope.  supposed hide political affiliation? acting like rioters protesters going fine practice social distancing (which don't), wear masks (which don't), protected self-righteousness. build shanty town Northwest? Literally swarming flies, human excrement, hygiene. People pushing barricades, stampeding. Yeah... none effect spread. shut nod head. LA mayor practically begging county residents come get test. symptoms referral needed. almost always spare capacity, waste test, truly **everyone wants test gets test**. (If triage priority get test today, priority may wait day two.) I'm mind. Even may years left deserve taken away. families deserve lose time. We're interconnected. human beings, nature love loved. steps take protect lives others, members society social contract, morally bound so. Finally found blood test O+ blood type. heard earlier type blood drastically reduces chances get COVID, get it, better case. still considered true? want get complacent, would ease anxiety know little advantage. worried lung damage months now. I'm someone mask often outdoors, I'm often getting FUCK away others, &amp; I'm putting mask I'm getting close shops/restaurants there's people around those. Thank much work, life saving, exhausting, dangerous brave. lucky you. Lot's love UK. Probably it’s residents wearing masks Unbelievable. depressing. Unreal sad truth. take pandemic serious lose friend family member. fair friend family member part school cirriculum US. middle school, high school university. Whether average person retained knowledge even enough shits give another issue. It’s important note science written racist sexist conclusion already mind. lot cherry picking poor experimental design involved produce conclusions weren’t factually accurate. that, pretty much kind work discredited scientific community. course, it’s easy say scientific community combat continued belief nonsense pseudoscience like phrenology almost “race science”, leads us right back around problem people believing anything hear scientist. Sunny Philadelphia Evolution Debate. Everybody wears mask though, sick. way pandemic started, part culture. haven’t even done pay backsies (reparations, 40 acres mule), wouldn’t bank guess  help Trump fight death common sense. US, I've heard of. think big issue that, normal circumstances, would Federal Government building program. would come Administration... Scientist bias towards making difficult enough reproduce work least keep edge, suggesting ""science"" great telling whole truth. 

They like lawyers writing patents sense. patents need broad, absolutely never help anyone implementation.

We really anything else science, think current scientific leaves *lot* desired. negative publication bias regarding replication studies, example. Negative results reported would another. 

A lot medical science influenced corporate interests.

Really, human science many biases member galactic science board (which totally thing), would probably allow humanity member. Yes fully understand that. No, grifters preying them, getting buy raspberry ketones $30/bottle whatever, selling ""I'm source truth you!"" nay... 30 years now? 40? deny are, fact, source truth would say they've duped. 

And pride motherfucker like that. California state wide mandatory masks lol Thank you! don’t see problem, long soylent green plant isn’t closed. Yes, work Healthcare. Maybe fauci get story straight stop misleading public. Maybe they'll trust So? mean everyone age group greedy, clueless Fox viewer? No, means Fox's target audience lies age range. plenty progressives age range well...just ask Martin Gugino.

And yes, world changed; I'm old enough watched happen. still mean everyone adult Reagan years Clinton years agreed aggressive corporate politics put place got us here, anything it, could done anything prevent it. That's two major parties corporate money machine.

Divisiveness serves one oppressor. shutdown standard solution, desperate solution unprecedented situation ( better, desperate solution necessary lack quick competent response situation point known ). Would agree ban driving temporarely situation 5 inches ice every road? ice melts ask people use winter tyres? Yep. business rules. PC building closed public, (primates cats aquatics) rest us went grammas much structurally sound house.

that thinking ""No don't, trap -- 'Grandma' Big Bad Wolf disguise!"" realized, mixing BBW Red Riding Hood, BBW Three Little Pigs XD distrust science much, typing smart phones invented SCIENCE MATH ENGINEERING

You're missing much. know raised decent household learned truth. things made science engineering. given us god. God speaks us chosen servants, scientists engineers gave world wonderful tools. Satan speaks us lies deceit careful mix word antichrist word Jesus!

*obviously* population-wide death risk numbers apply everyone equally - cant take consideration every person's individual needs. serve baseline make judgment handle this.

For example, 100 yr old grandpa's baseline 1 year death risk 1 3. 5 year death risk 9 10. So, attitude is, ""well good chance dying next year, I'd rather spend family - despite added risk - alone care home something"". literally yelled visiting him.

By contrast, 60 year old uncle poor health. feels additonal danger kept quarantine much reasonably possible - still running small business.

Anyone says version ""But loved one might die!"" doesnt understand people *already* know that. mean - going - react increased risk way others will.

America dont think elected official get re-elected intentionally ruining eradication status.

You might projecting American values onto countries dont think way.. Actually given minor virus among working age demographics, Covid-19 economically impactful way.

It's even 1/100,000 ""economically destructive"" lockdown measures play scrabble? said 50%. would guess 30 40%, think there's another study show updated numbers since original one April. rates infection dropped lot (probably least partially many people immunity), still many thousands confirmed cases since then, means many thousands asymptomatic cases well means higher antibody numbers. Good. Hollywood important people. Drive take freak out. I'm never sure cooking. real sargastic? would make take off? That's baffling me. people already required county level, yeah Clickbait title people don’t dogs average age Venice literally 74 lol. 

Luckily mine already planning buying house year zillow looking fire right now! Well, happy them. makes sense. governor already signaled restrictions right protect state time emergency did. Yet wear pants without complaining freedom. movie Idiocracy ahead time. Now, must go water garden Brawndo. interesting rally tomorrow👀 mean lying Santa, tooth fairy Easter Bunny years end supposed trust anything parents say again... problem anti-intellectualism:

there's though. There's also unaddressed problem *biased* science misused tyrannical causes, fact many people turn science ultimate arbiter insist science confident answers fact skeptical questions. wanna offended would 100% feel you. starts current sitting President new virus. knew nothing spread people get infected. learned presymptomatic transmission, guidance changed. That's literally science works. collect evidence reject/adapt previous beliefs, form test new ones.

There still lot know, example long immune (if all) infected recovered. know hell downvoted that. very, true. Stop put PPE on, matter what. emergencies pandemic. Yes, people LITERALLY become toxic. least clear understanding people want us family dead - anti-maskers Covideniers. think lot us really know neighbors stood issues this, everyone wears MAGA hat. Covideniers / Superspreaders plainly visible. 

Also: banned life forever. number infants toddlers killed hot cars also miniscule number,

i always found arguments bit... weird.

the kind problem may sound severe painted less severe important affects people.

in words, problem faced small number people insignificant

in words, people face rare problems insignificant

in words, common people matter

in words, we're society (weliveinasocietyjpg) mass. _not_ good application evolution species!

so problem become severe take steps avoid accidents? get it. Sorry, don’t mean ignorant here, vitamin death? said Russia China? know could US citizens. Thus far one knows behind it. guesses point. I'd expect number people suffering long term consequences dropping number deaths.

I'm sure better treatment counts reduced deaths. found silver bullet would effect oklahama seeing deaths. Let’s say 50 people symptoms spreading virus. give virus another 50 people also symptoms. Okay that’s even unlikely. give another 100 people. Sooner later someone symptoms. go weeks weeks weeks without single case turning virus. People symptoms aren’t contagious forever. cases virus. 

In state Australia last 80 cases. It’s gone 50 gone back up. It’s hard really kill virus completely without hard lock even good contact tracing. think black masks look fucking badass #Idiocracy Honestly speaking, science something politically motivated true scientist person speaks truth matter presented him. speak facts facts change research conducted time results evaluated time. Scientists make mistakes unlike politicians, balls mistakes. It’s reason think one hottest, sunniest, driest states country largest increase covid. warned them. Stomach acid. It’s pretty known getting surface contact unlikely. Irish hospitals virtually empty right now

That's horrible statement make current situation Ireland. know getting information from, say things like that. near Brazil USA, saying hospitals empty feels like rousing political statement instead factual one. It’s flu bro... funny long ago brainwashed ""patriots"" :)) There’s cultural differences. Also SARS much scarier individual level it’s much deadlier. Somewhere needs get *really* bad would see reversal course serious lockdown. Lombardy served warning rest world seem real enough convince America.

I'm done talking it. places reach crisis levels. Hopefully get scared straight afterwards. Seems worked well Florida... Sir Wendys start anywhere, especially since comment deleted.

You put place, son. shush, stay there.

Change coming November. kind likely make head explode 

I smiling thought prioritize keeping nursing homes safe death toll probably cut half.  viruses common cold coronaviruses. Rhinoviruses alone attribute least 50% common forms cold.  1st lockdown unnecessary.

A 2nd would atrocity. cant travel countries wont let in.  Degrade what? hell top scientist even mean original statement? created dashboard scratch. degree never specialized data management data scientist - geology. Maybe mean qualified scientist ""top scientist"" state specialize in.

Yes wise people tend drive less, make adjustments like avoiding certain areas, driving night, making long unnecessary trips etc. leave risk assessment individuals make themselves. banned driving altogether every time happened, lot innocent people would end getting screwed reasons nobody could predict. K-12 education really need well US. Orange county PD able write citations people wearing masks public due this. Things change. look areas across country requiring masks. much better are. judge high quality? know they’re effective. think waaaay cases rest world? socioeconomic problems largely result USA broke, spending money military, completely neglecting society. Effective robust social safety nets would’ve come clutch times many good people lose jobs. reason we’re lockdown anymore it’d require admiring status quo isn’t working average person. Cases become rise recently current death numbers reflect people infected weeks ago. Also, even people don’t die due better treatment may long-term health financial consequences ventilators number body 2 week hospital stays don’t come cheap US. Reddit anyways think we’re slurp fake media wishing [death illness children foster Actually believe attitude reason wrong. ever increasing attitude ""this going last forever"", get increasing case counts, reluctance anything it, eventually lead massive infections, point everyone gets infected dies out.

I already see attitude everywhere. world everyone careful believe over, never end. world everyone careless treats unavoidable risk, eventually risk gone. New York exponentially growing lockdown took ~4 weeks peak. Meaning almost certainly peak least ~4 weeks AZ full locks today. So, certainly get far worse. won’t get virus relief protecting actual virus? cases overall trending lower % positive lower well. think would 50% imply. Totally. neighboring countries nieither. Two party system broken... Media broken Florida sits empty, stupid look face. Sorry hear that. wanted make sure aware air border States open Canadians like Black Lace? 🤷‍♂️ know, always seems stand close everyone, could learn far virus travel air yelling crowd need help police enforce it.

ftfy fundamental fractures worst I'll throw ya upvote say he's right queue. week became fully apparent florida actually rise again. Im sure everyday week mayor talks advisors do, since governor clearly anything. 

Sure would great require masks soon started reopening, happen way. think option reversing reopening measures. believe me, still table masks work. Reading honestly made think Zuckerberg's testimony congress. first para played like script. normal soon. learn live deaths time, don’t see changing case.

I'm masks try play card me. One minute said know since Jan. Next said know hundred year. Know how? Pick reasoning wisely go emotions. always mask user? before? are, usage way now?

I mask user whole deal I'm sick public transport like airplanes.

This new disease lot unconventional things new. Always open adapt new approach best way fight it.

I even seen lot mask usage SAR outbreak. Meaning basically everywhere December. think proliferation masks help, hospitality industry probably going recover forseeable future. places cater outdoor seating much better can't.

the 2nd lockdown staring us face. much shutdowns economically destructive.....so outbreaks among workforce. past flu guidance

2009 influenza guidance relevant discussion face masks. make strong recommendations necessary. mask hoarding crisis, caregivers needed N95s could find them, cloth mask debate. report month ago, real update:

' Ben-Gurion University Negev's Prof. Gabby Sarusi developed validating test identifies carriers COVID-19 virus less minute greater 90% accuracy dramatically lower price method available. Clinical trials conjunction Defense Ministry 120 Israelis better 90% success rate compared Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests. ongoing trials seek determine test identify specific stage COVID-19 infection well presence. '

 Would’ve perfect Darwinian selection anti-science people got covid died. Alas, it’s people get infected pass onto vulnerable bystanders die. healthy young person good immune system count it. Disney+ censors Hamilton. :-( would be?

Climate change good place start. Elect women change weather? Fuck off.

Oh, let's forget ""experts"" refuse admit disease clearly engineered kill men, mostly female team WIV. Nah, totally came bats. Stop noticing things. 

But hey, least get hear black people 10% risk us. covering we're 300% risk women would much like affirming fact human, despite women think. would considered human rights issue? Literally asking people choose lives money. Exactly. won’t know “real” plan mid July. spread could get significantly worse, find alternatives. problem masculinity, trying masculine. wonders credibility... identify political party is, everything political. Thank voice reason! kills go places there’s many people without masks like pandemic done with. work critical care far over. Also, side note, visited Sacramento fall first time gotta say governor portrait capitol badass. I'm curious might slow things degree. two strains virus time? meet coworker, then. He's always spouting ""No one know come it"" (wit inflection signals he's fishing around room someone hop bandwagon). Owner asked everyone wear mask follow city guidelines. dude refused hipster beard ""makes impossible wear mask"". Man hate sounding cheesy, always looked kid watching movies, like hero!

And adult really say hero. Thank :) respect opinion believe protests systemic larger issue Li Wenliang discover anything, posted WeChat SARS back, day informed nCov sense take virus lightly. sounds like total crock shit pretty good shutdown.

His benchmark 50-60% compliance, based survey grocery stores. best. \*curls ball\* honestly find hilarious politics, human construct, important people literal forces nature. Imagine someone arguing hurricane, active volcano. call NWO Explain betwetter vs. reality debate? 

That's going long discourse. Arnie white republican, people would silent matter. Trump Kenya thing racist. Arnold vs Joe let's gooooo Hmm agreed. maybe people saw bad first spike would like “oh fuck! need complete lockdown” 

And people would willing wait out. Spike would worse long term outlook might better Joe Rogan moron? 

It's entirely possible.  could make good argument is. theyre downoviting want whine 'their rights' wearing mask. someother completely absurd, un-backable reason. :D Anyone defying order... Terminated.  China lies, US smart enough control pandemic country....

Certainly guess could wrong, people could contracted disease third person, coincidentally gotten infected time two completely different vectors. we've learned disease tends spread easily family members close contact, think reasonable guess two cases connected.

Best Guess #2 - symptomatic relative sick first. Again, could wrong. made guess seems like symptomatic people tend spread disease easily -- really certain yet lot research still needs done asymptomatic spreaders, logically makes sense people show symptoms discharging respiratory droplets likely spread it.

Best Guess #3 - Since family member appears recently become sick enough tested, likely member actually got infected time ago, within window spread officer time infectious June 10th. guess I'm uncomfortable with, would really like specific details exactly family member first began noticing symptoms. timeline transmissability virus long seems possible. would *less* likely, however, officer could gotten first exposed protest June 10th, become infectious himself, passed relative, relative could become symptomatic received test results back June 19th. timeline feels much compressed me.

This entire disease sometimes feels like blindfolded dark room trying hit dartboard. really, really hope good contact tracers guessing like am, answers tracking exposures individuals. took us four weeks March 21st shutdown Illinois even see decrease cases **or** deaths. 

It kept going 2-3 weeks, plateaued 2500 cases day four weeks. *hard* shutdown. lost 100 people day 5 weeks. population 11M state. DeBlasio indicated tracers NYC can’t ask. Crazy ask me. “Good. Goooooooooooooooood.” glad mask available. time free mask funding. Heck ask register give “Mask All” fund. yes, lockdown hysteria killing people. Here's 75k start:

And include people scared go hospital, can't get normal screenings, etc. like guy:

http://archive.is/iiKAW prefer covidexitstrategy.org, get 14 day charts. peak, NJ hit ~50% positivity rate. lasted 3 weeks. grim, peaked 460 deaths one day. That's great question. I'm wearing masks act caring others well-being. affects herd immunity, I'd research it. Oh, hospital beds? That’s comforting. “How dare younger people go places encouraging go to.” Put Fly list. weird rant. 

People hostile school plainclothes loss prevention frequently. never choked anyone handcuffed number. 

I never said disagreed protests. actually fully support think it’s taken long get point. lot cops control deescalation skills whatsoever. insane amount videos coming police abusing people right (and before) appalling. used able talk people back without cuff felonies unarmed. Cops need better. 

That said, incredibly irresponsible healthcare workers see patients going mass protests pandemic. don’t see find controversial. working immunocompromised people elderly see many people daily. 

I think protests spare healthcare workers people don’t die. many ways healthcare workers support cause. 

Today US 675 people died now. mere months 120,000 people died US pandemic. protests aren’t going impacted healthcare workers right thing stay home. less powerful, meaningful effective. Well I'll fine Croatia considering feel first wave apart fact economy completely destroyed. Also, people want show support whether actively sick not. 

My grandmother-in-law wouldn’t shut Trump hours died (not Covid/years ago). town would’ve lived adrenaline another day see him. First sentence article disproves blatant disagrees, said 10 days ago: **no asymptomatic official leading World Health Organization’s COVID-19 response clarified comments made media briefing Monday that **suggested coronavirus transmission asymptomatic individuals ""very rare."" **

Also correct Clarified

This easy. copy paste disprove you. wish dishonest people lazy are. open minded you. $1250 seems like mask extra steps! checked sub couple months ago saw word ""scamdemic"" thrown around lot. great word use almost every day whenever girlfriend friend says pandemic go, ""more like scamdemic!"" roll eyes. really obnoxious fun Yea since it’s bad right nothing go bad later!!!!! can't tell distrust science/expertise part political strategy. think blame fall states start/continue hospitalization death spikes states having?

edit: mask wearing cost way reduce virus. continues blow mind state leaders President going way encourage normalize that. Put phone airplane mode pop shows cancel paywall. people think testing? last 2 weeks shouldnt matter much test gone...unless theres new cases duh!! rocket science Permanent lack authentic human interaction pretty dystopian reasonable measure. Right, charge paying healthcare workers less. people light case home treating (at least official advise NYC), means people sick enough get confirmed.

Most people surely ventilators must going hell. supposed really awful go even young people. exposed comiting crimes guise COVID19. Suspect exact thing happening EVERYWHERE. 2022.  care US/China rivalry. country fucked China's virus China's coverup. care that, current deaths. history. 

US China jointly worked GoF research SARS like viruses. SARS COV 2 pre adapted humans time reached wet market, highest affinity human ace2, seems like selectively bred lab GoF research. forgive charitable toward China eloberate bs. DeWine good job first. fuck happened?? Man, think giving much credit. current president really seem particularly bright, honest. caught fuckers :D Thanks recommendation! Yeah, president proved tough enough risk citizen's lives. clout chaser nothing see Uhg, agree believe article confirms. increasingly clear time needed resolve barriers resumption United States.” another perfect example type scum right-wingers become Masks work. Six feet distance works better. Handwashing works best,

Really? go bar, choose wearing mask, maintaining six feet distance, washing hands, protect respiratory virus, go hand washing?  Good fuck guy Definitely fatigue. Come Chicago see real lockdown works y’all fatigue. 


I’m sorry people work inconsiderate. hope stay safe [US said thing ""prevent Oh buddy, really polite though eh?

Tl;dr don’t. trails drug ended due overwhelming evidence drug reduces mortality, significantly, amongst seriously ill - requiring oxygen via CPAP mechanical ventilation. 

This longer experimental drug treatment COVID-19. Science endorsed via scientific method applied prescribed medications. states rising numbers opened early. I’m saying protests didn’t spread virus states spiking early opening. dont know people think heat get rid thing hot places like flordia arizona south Carolina tons cases What's point? Nothing article mentions protestors Thats contact tracing for... Precisely. Mayor DeBlasio spent good portion March squabbling trying one finally taking action. even point? ride out? hospitals holding up? live Arizona totally agree, never happen. I'm pretty sure Ducey even said going lock again. finally allowed city mayors decide wanted mandate masks looks like almost far. Hopefully helps already shitty spot I'm dreading seeing bad gets. law, aircraft, law. deal douche canoe Nope fuck China  ports allow them. That’s real issue. They’ll find people desperate enough perform work numbered cruises. signals fact can’t sail ports. nonsense. Yet, many believe it.  slower summer spread looks like US. fall could get rough. like world leaders trying see kill most, next trump rally Local critics especially, yes. cities like NY LA, usually arrange critics-only screenings (oftentimes hotel conference room dedicated office space studio owns)—but towns around country, local film critic attends advance screenings open general public (these usually “sneak previews” radio stations movie theaters give away tickets to). 

Studios *very* hesitant giving actual copies new films anyone, especially likely pirated (ie, major new releases). time usually happens awards season, FYC (for consideration) discs mailed members certain guilds academies voting stakes. usually come lot anti-piracy technology, like invisible watermarking track individual member leaked copy online. Florida CA track are. archive [http://archive.is/UDRxe](http://archive.is/UDRxe) Yup. Florida right? one could seen coming. /s Fair point. Reddit last 99 comments actually we're emotive autism...

# Brazil becomes second country hit one million cases get added bonus weather going direction soon. maybe month starts rolling way, another month enter ""flavor country"" Wow. around 30,000 tests per day. That's terrible considering challenging still test many.

If course, still enough.

I'm North wondering we're right behind you. 


PrayForFlorida Good know— hope feel better soon!  “No one going argue going isn’t serious. serious now? would submit court longer emergency.”

That disbarment level stupidity, dumbass even get semester law school? virtue signaling training. Wearing mask gets way officer putting gas mask quickly. strange times... 

No sir, like it. São Paulo added 19k cases today, said 'trouble' adding before. thing Brazil reached daily testing capacity daily numbers probably stay around 30k/40k start actually testing people See also well: Anti-Intellectualism Pol Pot pisses closed parks boat ramps trailheads. month ago said went outside everyone called grandma killer ""I medical condition prevents wearing mask""

A medical condition like exact reason want people wear masks. Also, huge asshole medical condition. terrible small minded attitude. You’re trying change. You’re trying project toxicity stir shit online feel better yourself. actually want better wouldn’t throwing around instagatory language. 
 
You aren’t considering systemic abuses system, privileges. You’re bad human general. national leader deliberately ignores science, clear evidence, yet still deliberately endangers millions people, guilty genocide? Scratch that. made time daily record. wow great argument. Can’t handle facts pull insults.

TL;DR: summer slows cold/flu viruses, enough, needs extra steps stop those, covid one those. see depths stupidity snd Trump rally. Trump also hoping trouble supporters anti-Trump people
I wonder many supporters bring home virus grandma grandpa.
I sickened. imagining kind damage Trump country November.. getting high without airplane. Sadly people literally shooting people trying enforce masks. country’s got issues evidence already there, feel deep gut, waking up!

The rest numbers made support whatever. feel not?

There's certain feeling get standing high cliff structure. needs said, feel it.. See around map check number positive tests per 100.000 inhabitants. 

You'll notice number remarkabky high Amsterdam: 1.6

Yeah cases increasing deaths stable. know it’s popular opinion something we’re gonna learn live with. absolutely cannot afford another shutdown, know many people lost businesses jobs. I’m sorry sub really touch issues lockdown brought on. Colombia national no-tax-day today, people gone crazy. I'm 100% sure cases skyrocket thanks this. Permanent masks would dystopian nightmare,

What privileged life lead think wearing fucking mask things dystopian. 54,771 New cases according official ministry health release Truth is, *is* different. Viruses spread fine summer. average spend time indoors, viruses survive longer air surfaces cool weather warm, always see increase transmissability fall. lot got emotions, wish could reason way out, lot time really personal connections make small victories. Probably not, definitely enough scare people wearing mask would imagine. idea possible punishment wearing one enough people finally put one on. Damn. listening sports radio today - crediting PGA efforts resuming play without outbreak, questioned sports unable replicate PGAs efforts/results. people died cause recieve medical care hospitals full covid patients sense count covid victims. someone sets fire die fire, responsable cause fact died asphyxia set fire directly.

if want elaborate said also take account people die car crashes cause lockdown allowed drive, people die work cause allowed work, point one could say covid deaths even underreported. 

yes, excess mortality give perfect number accurate indicator pick quick analysis, wanna go deep order get accurate numbers got take account sides story. Little History: Look US actions beginning AIDS/HIV pandemic 1981. see China much forthcoming US ever was. dont get it. DHS gain witholding masks protective equipment? deaths lagging indicator two four weeks. weaker snowflake guy? face shield might solution People aren’t interconnected Arizona NYC though. Suburban sprawl might actually advantage way. Obviously going crowds events isn’t smart virus spread way, think lot NYC’s problem dense shoulder shoulder people live there. Brazil already reached daily testing capacity growing fast hell daily cases change. 32k everyday. daily deaths, 1,300. Today one states added 19k cases 'trouble' adding before, today daily cases reached 54k, that's one special case. Brazil testing people see false feeling plateauing actually not. "" *The country registered record 54,771 cases Friday* ""

Basically double 27K reported US. lack medical resources makes number even alarming. Require businesses charge $100 spot tax wearing mask get keep 100% of. I'm guessing cancellations something low bookings along covid19 breakouts still continuing. Sort flight canceled due ""technical problems"" fact many passengers scheduled. 

 can't imagine folks rushing get onto cruise ships. Port-o-potties air circulation though. someone drops bomb coughs port-o-john, get ~10 minutes later, might screwed. things actually. 

Less education, less access healthcare, higher obesity rates, lower incomes, lower lifespans, higher gun crime, overwhelmingly Conservative. bot then? Now, ""but protests"", especially anything wearing masks. deleted comment link wikipedia listing walkaway movement, lays pretty clearly astroturfing campaign.

No idea doomy asking since chose clarify idea intended meaning was.  average non-redditing Floridians know state’s current issue? ask I’m worried elderly know isn’t blasted tv news, probably won’t hear much. Burn victims also, since masks aggravate burn scars Here's idea: Add fine, work w/ retailers let mayor full access video camera's fine many people match faces, give money directly retailer, they're incentivized snitch. Give bonuses cashiers turn people in, pay w/ cc button: wearing mask, flags automatically fines available funds. Yeah wonder long first player comes virus reaction that. plans that? asshole medical condition. March predicted 600k US deaths end 2020. combination infection rates, death rates, banking people pants head foolish.

People scoffed numbers real life early march.

They told would never pass 50k.

then 60k.

Then 100k.

Now folks saying never bust 300k.

Wear masks prove wrong animals.  Finally, correct answer bottom thread. Travis didnt even report yesterday think. we'll backlog yesterday + today's numbers. I'm predicting ~500 Travis county.  rule #2 - edited titles ~~Dumb~~ Floridians help Chinese tried hush things silence scientists discovered first.

Why basic survival political issue ? Covfefe  far worst I've seen life. going church is. haven’t said anything challenge. stated opinion. single contrary example would disprove opinion rule, we’re left perspective. Downvotes adequate rebuttal show dont share perspective. 

As person you’re defending, viruses don’t “course”. comment doesn’t make sense begin with. judge viruses impact halfway through? would even measure? Maybe explain it. AMC, then? normal circumstances ideal situation links might case. however amidst pandemic people favour saving unforeseen circumstances spending survey might accurate.

some insight scientific studies might interested know list conditions assumptions run program (i know i've ran scientific study well, granted college), i'll take called 'survey' 'studies' grain salt, one know underlying condition set survey, two media professional comes reporting partial facts, things wholely reflect actuality society, especially special times we're going right now.

I use worldometers way, cut ~9pm est. Strong people compassionate thing regardless what's politically socially convenient.

Lockdowns/masks/distancing serve flatten curve, end virus. extent without overwhelming hospital capacities, continue normal healthy develop immunity. Otherwise we're dragging out, ensuring grandma everyone else lower quality life interim. Honestly almost around long enough report antibodies could last little 3 months true, people still cautious testing positive Kentucky Karen's could read, understand. That's called moron, activist. nah, US ramping speak, want #1, trump won’t sit watching brazil overtaking thé US, hold rallies people don’t wear masks states. #MAGA  Don’t forget salary 54k working 80+ hours whole ass doctor Horrifying. major growth SoCal counties.  better testing rest state?  Documentation needed disability obvious. think wheelchair considered obvious. Yep, he's managed appropriate two different cultures career... Neither one represent actual life experience 2% death rate..... Singapore highly authoritarian society educated population.

That’s winning combo scenario.

^(Also Qatar taking harshest measures country lower cases) two people wear masks, one virus, chance infection less 2% infected one speaks breathes direction healthy one. Unfortunately, masks much keep virus *in* keep virus out. That's vital everyone wear masks much possible know asymptomatic cases doesn't.

Unfortunately, get these... people (in lieu *really* want call them) refuse freedom. 🤷🏻‍♂️

So answer question, nothing guaranteed, take precautions. would like hope Chicago logical rules place due higher population density. Good luck move! (I moving tomorrow too, actually!) wants everyone know get free ice cream live ventilation. Punched multiple women's asses, pulled breast woman set predator, ""allegedly"" used position maids boss get sexual gratuity conceived child her. absolutely hate anyone pretentious enough call “an activist” days. 

I want tell isn’t 60’s. one systematically oppressed. hero. make difference. You’ve seen waaay many movies you’re bored worthless life, trying feel validated. forgot two important factors: lots air conditioning older/aging population. really see wearing mask construed weak. 

In opinion wearing mask everyone else solid case sick makes better, stonger, person endangering others.  I've annoyed since 90's like couple decent rock stations radio while, every half hour BOWDIDDYBOWDIDANGIDANGDIGIDIGI... reason song gives feeling spit on. I'm simultaneously insulted disgusted. Blatant pandering without hint authenticity. Yes, fired didn’t like data gave. Like said before, sometimes people think deserve compassion communication need most, get it. Try compassion someone think deserve it, results may change mind.. SC here! Got tested yesterday. Still waiting hear results! live alone birthday next week. So, sucks.

On bright side, symptoms one morning I've fine ever since. can't imagine going movie theater right now. people actually this? believe said already tracked. Zero reason name calling. 

I would get bit zombie uprising. also smart enough know zombies actual things. Serious question. Texas list?  close Brazil hospitals collapse? yet invented high tech solution low tech works consistently applied? long political leadership greatest nation pulling direction stupid enough consistency.

BTW: HBR good books leadership, maybe provide authors selected ones. thing is, go work protesters hate themselves, spouses kids much can't exist household them. can't relax enjoy time connect family. look forward vacations - hate them. look weekend, drink it. misread thought said ""dentist assholes""???? health system must basically collapsed. shut country down. 21% Texas! used 4%. live Arizona school district planning starting school next month. one denying all. serious disease. think important see long term ramifications every approach, acknowledge it.

Remember, poverty effect health too, ways kill you. top 10% income live 10 years longer bottom 10%. COVID takes 10 years life average person dies it, 70% people catch 1 million die predicted ""mitigation"" scenario, that's 10 million life years. 10% people US 33 million people, losing 10 years life. 330 million years lost poverty lifetime.

Sending people poverty nothing scoff at. kills, also maims.

I'm pretending know better approach is, know false dichotomy say saving lives economy. damned do, damned situation. However, think awful falsely reassured NPIs ""working"" without aggressively pushing better interventions (e.g. universal masks, surgical masks cloth masks that, testing, better policies allowing people isolate, like giving unemployment benefits 65+ serious conditions, etc...). ardent supporter President Trump

aightt, everything's clear aw, yea, guys pretty rough time there. interesting well disheartening see virus affecting different parts country quite differently. seems SW West Coast getting hit hard again. I'm still much worried I'm also feeling depressed isolation unknown. realize unique feeling moment. safe  Cut shit. knew masks would reduce transmission. knew fucked Time manufacturing couldn’t rapidly scale PPE cover healthcare workers public.

It wrong lie, take lumps it. Fauci fucked up. should’ve told people wear bandanas around face public. sounds right... Totally image saying time Throw ""don't take mask sneezing"". 

Saw today. everyone wear masks, would almost effective, much less costly. need reduce R0 little bit more. animals caught far (dogs cats) shown capable transmitting people. 

Now, mutation resulting zoonotic transmission possible, that's possible ton scary viruses heard yet they've never done pose threat us

Until direct zoonotic transmission established species we're likely come contact with, really think concern way overblown. 

They worried mosquitoes passing (worried Florida) far seems transmit way. Almost entirely close human interaction well Brexit fix all... ingrates represent America. loved Jingle way Politics: *(noun)* viewpoint asks improve person causes discomfort preconceived notions. Donald Trump said Americans might wear face masks way prevent spread coronavirus way “signal disapproval him.” Imagine entire population people believe wearing mask carry around gun protection. 

What fucking retarded state born in. people ironically live fear government taking away rights. somehow people wearing mask protect others fear based driven ideas ""government going take away rights ear masks police military guns 2nd ammendment ruined liberals.."" fear based common sense based? That's discussion hey nice try. know what’s manly? laid bed two weeks terrible illness could prevented. They're worried concession sales, probably. Make sure read notes shooting virus? Probably going happen. Why? teacher oversees dozens children, xyz teachers get sick, school cannot operate. xyz unionized teachers take semi permanent disability chronic illness, school cannot operate.

Schools like hospitals lives teachers thrown away like nurses expect continue. stupid us arent idiots, wear masks, refuse go watch movie long allow covid deniers building. 

So trying please ""both sides"" lose support majority think lot people still think masks attempt protect virus, also consider sign afraid it. easy people weird ideas completely different assumptions start with. I’ve Kimmel Fallon lockdown, talking PPE after-school program pivoted provide groceries 100,000 families serve. Lulu Whiskey made cameo Kimmel. always someone else share links. strikes Texas government stubborn admit problem hands reverse course. Woke virus... B-BUT... Muri ca.

* doesnt work 
* inhibits breathing 
* tool test compliance

The people get stores (and immediately remove thereafter) forgiven ultimate idiots fools driving around Ha chief, woah big man. Wearing masks save people's lives, prevent others getting sick help stop spread. tough, selfish, nobody missing seeing expression people missing family members people like yourself. Believe me, relaxing, renewed spike many U.S. States right now, thing going around while. 100%. science become subordinate political optics? don’t understand mentality. best way protect people rioting make sure government run way doesn’t make want riot. 

The mask hysteria didn’t disappear. It’s happening, biggest protests generation. So-called “man”... Forever. May well get used it. Going away YouTube available Spotify Well manliest man said wear mask excuse saying bullshit now. Thank you. Thank kindly Mr. Terminator believe TV shows bring network subtle propaganda too. Bones one older seasons suggested Trump running president. announced would run. Like priming peoples acceptance idea. turned show completely. Man, feel like I’ve loosened bit let child play like two kids know families careful, it’s months one sick, state one majorly declining cases states...and read 200+ people mask wedding I’m like DAFUQ? That’s thing?! Fuuuuuuk that. I’m sure there’s ridiculous bridezilla behind who’s valuing “her day” safety hundreds people supposedly loves. That’s shameful shit man, DAMN. 

You get married beach, like 20-30 people socially distanced find way safely? Yeah, it’s ur new reality live that. southern slam Weddin’ pretend like nothing happening? fucking way would even THINK going that. Common enough celebrity presidents. Fool once, shame me. Fool twice, ain't gonna fool   Maybe start harassing non-mask wearers they'll change ways. Really hard figure why? unbelievably sad. Yup, too. get people hate wearing masks. love it-- distracts face, awful. going exponential curve America..Many us stupid selfish. Yeah possible think much less sad way. put tuques, scarves mittens children protect winter cold, hats protect UV, seatbelts protect car accidents, etc. 

This covid thing surely suck wish happening us...but is. putting kids cloth masks protects other's virus play together again, well, rationalize another piece protective fabric. Texas reckless. They’ll learn it’s late Wait hold on, didn’t start testing running clinical trials immediately drug used treat SARS MERS first?!?

Jesus Christ, love science, sometimes refusal use concept precedent guide decision making gives migrane ""gets it"", assume mean understand 😉 Hey gre late 70s 80s 90s. sound like nothing like parents.

Hate bias say maybe ethnicity personal cultural experiences though. years I've realized different upbringing compared peers. people grew may still encountered POC life mom, even met her. aside obviously

First off, lol. 

Secondly, interestingly enough, searched article said anything this, came across one. scientists haven’t yet established virus jumped directly bats humans.

There might intermediary host. Still, novice opinion, virus go human species, see opposite would impossible. article also month old, might recent data there. Lol field hospitals. company jus helped make entire Miami convention center one....

Why acting like know you’re talking about? Things really bad, crisis levels, within 8 weeks 10+ states going hospital beds. Positive feedback coronavirus... mean people.. see.. right. I've seen people packed beaches here. . Sure he’s increased partisanship even without I’m sure would become partisan thing. That’s country is. canada, pls  helped reducing total deaths specifically covid, potentially, now. would love to! No, really! Love idea.

But certain group ""activists"" burnt fucking city making state even worse shit hole live happen know better people living it.

Can help pass lovely message along? Whenever man says something manly feels need parade manliness, usually little dick energy. Wow. People see someone smiles mask on. lease can. cruel make attendants wear mask travelers feel fine, attendants could die. Thing is, many Americans refuse wear masks. makes think would've embraced then? AKA bother looking forward anything. couldn’t pay cash money sit theater 2+ hours bunch strangers, even mask.

I suspect strongly real reason concessions. It’s well known theaters make profit snacks. force people wear masks, can’t eat. They’d rather let people go without masks sell $.08 worth popcorn $15. Logically going get it. matter when?  states need mandate masks public places NOW! ignorance rampant; many segments glorified, considered virtue. People proud stupid; trust smart people understand them. think Fauci something, nefarious deep state conspiracy. That's one things, addition racism, deplorables hated Obama; he's articulate open minded can't relate. course social media exacerbates problem always find others get stirred up. think find posts pretty logical factual. want hear it, make illogical. article Tampa General says 12 ICU beds 126.  Bunch staff infected work. fine. good job donny ---- china 74% full now. rate COVID? I’ll honest grandparents ICUs across country years precovid never saw one two empty rooms.  

I’m trying take away seriousness feel like news throws sensationalist numbers base stat line. maintain problem across political spectrum.

If don’t believe me, proudly serve buffet GMO foods group concerned climate change activists. You’ll plenty leftovers. I'm saying people fed up. European system care citizens... 

My wife listed job 407 applications 4 days.... 

People broke pissed off.  Anytime need encouragement stick got back.

The folks denying anything deny state hits one highest part capita daily counts country Crazy live next hospital. Everyone scrubs maskless public. Covid can’t wait go back school again... president like FDR JFK right now. Thank stays hospital closer month. lasted two months more. shorter stays tended people died, although handful last month passing. IMO putting profits safety employees. Blaming religion anti-intellectualism isn’t necessarily correct. plenty people subscribe evangelical religion intellectuals also were/are leaders respective fields — mention almost science monotheistic countries meant unlock secrets world believed created intelligent design. 

For example Johannes Kepler, credited making laws planetary motion said: “Those laws [of nature] within grasp human mind; God wanted us recognize creating us image could share thoughts.[80]” — This.  across world, people mostly realize that’s it’s political issue. American’s - maybe it’s election year- it’s ploy enemy. can’t people know serve uphold oath took. Put separation aside protect people? law order supposed protect average citizens rioting looting? like mask hysteria magically disappeared weeks media drummed thousands people large groups mass chaos. Newsom silent then.  lol comments scoffing guy he's Texas. Texas largest medical center world best doctors practice there. Well pompeo trump seem done, despite claiming enormous amounts evidence. seem gone little quiet since asking prove it. say... ""I'll masked"" B..bbut Ben Shapiro says facts care feelings. know what? Fuck feelings! **proceeds feel manly** long term, likely less deadly mutation emerge become prevailing strain. But, years even mutation appears soon. reason virus hasnt failed- good transmission. Unlike Sars Mers wont fade away reason.

If pandemic like others throughout known history, second wave worse. People letting guard couple months likely reason why. less likely happen NY, WA, MI, likely happen elsewhere, like seeing south southwest. I’ll tell this. It’s everyone else poor. Lmao not. didn’t say wasn’t funny! hero Arnold. Thanks PSA's. Didn’t hear steroids. That’s little bit relief.  would taken diverting trillions funds feds ended giving people need money state governments stay locked another month reduce spread initial wave came NYC. mandated mask wearing social distancing another month top likely would contained point (had spent money so) could new team contact tracing nip bud entirely. instead opened everything still upward trends infections certain places trend starting get control again. literally could monkey white house would better spot now. police part gets me, like actively ignoring people yelling posting brutality videos followups officer either never disciplined rehired. point times get disciplined say ""sO YeLliNg AbOuT!"" ELI5 envo mask? start take property rights see riots. moratorium needs overturned ASAP. That's load bullshit. Fauci trying save face stop idolizing him, see it. really sick new year/ Christmas. started describing covid symptoms March knew had.

No one believed me, ""it around back then"". tested positive antibodies week. course not, still need to. enjoy Jingle Way, worth. [This think idea either. yesterday, 356,000 people PCR tested Beijing. amazing, they're also make Bolsonaro look bad. Very. Given many people given trying even take cursory protective actions measures defend unthinking virus, rapidly losing confidence much American people deal something requiring adversity sacrifice. much decadence, alas. 

“This alien invasion something need learn live with.” Interesting Cue MAGA morons smashing Terminator DVDs Blu-Rays cancelling subs service Arnold movies them. Masks enforced Southwest. I've flown twice multiple passengers told put back on. Middle seats empty well flight attendants new measures reducing contact. Apart circulated air, much worse going Walmart.  Lmao, making fun stupid people is... Cool? boo Meanwhile Jr. Trump governor AZ. Yep. I'm getting lot need fancy flu vaccine group too. really understand mentality. thanks. would rather breathe. mouth /nose choice I'm one, never political safe keep others safe. talk Feb buddy probably head back states. Don’t want ride shit Thailand. Lol Florida. mention 194 countries economic aspect... ridiculous think something like hoax. thought too. profits likely come 10 dollar tubs popcorn. medical mystery. much longer seems Thank you, Mr. Schwarzenegger. cost lives, extreme measures taken. Sure wish China &amp; lie time, huh?

Oh wait- alongside many others refrain criticizing true culprit. Ironic. exactly. SCOTUS, led Scalia, 2010 found long law target religious ceremonies going church, it’s legal. example, law bans groups 50 people *all* buildings fine, cannot pass law bans groups 50 people churches. bodybuilders public intellectuals god love america painless way commit seppuku Ironic. 32.... right...

Of course eligible test went wet market. Well, want evidence “narrative” real - take look hospitalization rates. They’ve recently started increasing (as expected increasing cases).  

I would guess see deaths increasing within 1-2 weeks. I’m hopeful recent drug discoveries, don’t increase quite much would month ago. Basically Bill Burr's 'WHAT F*G"" bit without self awareness social commentary

(censored idk reddit autoban word lol) man legend entire time chilling pet donkey Near don’t sound like construct English sentence. idea “you don’t sound full you’re self” supposed actually mean post True love him! Arnold speaking truths!  Big facts! says right side box nothing Corona virus. Admit it, laughed That's originally implemented, weapons. like they've extended many things can't change TBF gnarly fucking virus always going large amount people going die it. least slowed bought time, discovered steroid treatment ""hopeless cases"" cut rate death 1/3.

I know, I'm trying stay positive. soon someone get tested think exposed Covid19?

My boyfriends brother went back work Monday. brother co worker, “Bob”, electrician week Covid19.

Bob found today got sent home.

What’s earliest boyfriend get tested? parents live him? know sometimes early bring negative. also jumped spotify sellout, totally agree one sincerely wonder made far life. He's seriously one dumbest, loudest voices america. hate way society works. someone show him? pretty easy first time [The 5 basic laws human stupidity, according Always inevitably, us underestimates number stupid individuals world 
1. probability certain person stupid independent characteristic person 
1. stupid person one causes harm another person group without time obtaining benefit even damaging  
1. Non-stupid people always underestimate harmful potential stupid people 
1. stupid person dangerous person exists people need make decision continue self-quarantine. Fortunately vast majority truly high risk group work, option. 

Everyone else needs move life. U wish... Again, think I’ve learned last three years level whatever worry legality later. virus like coronaviruses, means vaccine even infected confer long-term immunity per se. Sure, future infections might less severe people, mean going away. 

I predict people constantly need COVID-19 booster shots vaccine available, like every year, like flu. Maybe might better vaccine later on. perhaps time goes on, bodies get better identifying pathogen stopping without complications that's probably years away.  So, saying problem isnt people refusing wear masks, problem *media* thats telling us them.

I refuse believe argument made sense head. ball pit scene classic kid, Mr. Schwarzenegger Welcome America, Arnie. land opportunidiots!  **Not wearing mask, apparently makes America great—somehow** \#MAGA? think hit bases here. imagine people voted celebrity actually president? even imagine fucking stupid level stupidity is? Apparently ! I’ve asked several people. Never get response governator spoken 💪 Things pretty slow recently everything skyrocketed last two weeks. It’s odd town cases (Greenville) lower death rate, know hospital participating lot clinical trials. They’ve managed well far. I’m worried rapid increase overwhelm hospitals won’t able keep death rate down, hopefully doesn’t happen local hospital officials mayor held press conferences begging people cautious. mean may wear mask..depends.

Covid masks aside...

Does anyone actually trust Government? Little know actually easier track phone Facebook... going open again. So, basically, locked nothing. ""I'm politics, I'm survival."" bet I’d get downvoted hell said support Trump willing consider point view (or least parts it) clicked link...the one Beijing lifting recommendation wear masks outdoors. make look like recently (like now, mid-June) reviewed evidence found outdoor masks unnecessary/unhelpful. looks like article, actually mid-May, lifting mask requirements part release lockdown, situation new cases.

Quoting Redditors express aversion masks great research either. could easily found pro-mask Redditors quote.

Disappointing. sheer length post, expecting something academic merit. Makes sense. Although given way things move, September opening probably start show spike October near it.  “We aren’t closing, telling employees” guy one first wall Jesus comes back. Arnold's got 'Fuck you' capital. Yeah right think police firing rubber bullets people standing porch something. Gotta love murica absolute moron would Governor Texas banned cities counties state requiring masks, declared schools must person classes August. fair enough - support screening dangerous weapons such, go beyond airports imo File 
# SHIT SHERLOCK ~~Polarized~~ Radicalized idiots forget things transcend politics. Cali, 50 60 percent. 100 percent younger people, kids using half ass. Good. hope go business. environmental destruction emissions cruises create unconscionable cannot justified moving forward. industry needs made relic past. continue normal healthy develop immunity

Before go ahead make plan revolves around establish possible, otherwise letting people die blind guess. Good ban idiots dont wear masks. deeply concerning me. Idk anyone else heard recently evidence suggest original breakout Wuhan happened early October November didn’t hear December. that’s case, Italy US could’ve infected soon December. brother Erik.

Blackwater: navy! fucking go again. US healthcare system meme said basically nothing conversation healthcare workers protesting. weird. one even weirder. Let’s convince seatbelts outlawed.  fact even said pathetic.  friend, guys oppression deal too. good luck! Unforeskin side effects, got it. reads like identifying local hotspots, trying address it. sound like widespread issue. hope get control quickly. effective treatment would faster vaccine stall disease . mean, doable get effecive treatment sooner vaccine. say something class issue race issue saying issue matter. essentially saying fine covid disproportionately affecting black people racial issue. 

There always lower class always less educated people. say black problems class problems, dismissing real issues black people have. 

You're telling problems they're low class racism cultural issues. think I've read article every day week Idk. Texas revised unemployment need look jobs clearly ain't looking shut down. Sounds like spread slowing down. Maybe due working measures? 

That would really presumptuous.       
The spread slowing always go point another. question is, happening sooner (reminder: according Tegnell, Sweden past peak [march )? I'd say (lack of) measures.  Lookie here: 

I see SINGLE statistic says they're ""second infected"". tried corporation? Yeah stop sports  Heat probably would destroy virus pretty easily... outdoors, is. tell experience nobody goes outdoors Arizona summer. They're huddled cubicles AC circulating juicy rona. Yeah.... people going protesting really helping. Israeli government must see chance lol, current American leadership giving greenlights everything.


You stay strong friend... May God preserve us quickly blew up, worries places might similar issues road, especially ""roadmap recovery"", whatever. state, people cookouts, parties, hangouts. People wear masks forced situations, others care. Especially considering takes people's worth catalyst slowly get ball rolling, hard see state opening back problems. Hopefully though. ‘wait two weeks’ deniers seem reddit. It’s almost tying woo child complying Actually today DeSantis like ""It's ok knew would happen. knew would little uptick cases reopening."" Yeah, nothing concerned here. Nope. Proceed reopenings... /s defining ""mass death"" mean something like bubonic plague takes people ages large numbers. significantly different, deaths 80 common.

I know think I'm making selfish argument here. I'm opposite, looking long term societal effects.

I'm particularly thinking cohort kids grow without nonverbal communication skills masked school (one example).

Also FWIW perspective someone COVID (as mom late 60s).  must include children... mean fuck voted dumb head first place? ""Hard-hit"" huge understatement Texas' record-high daily cases June 16th. Stop lying saying reaches record-high every day. desperate fear point. ...Some countries easier others. Care point out? 165K New Cases today, take long... OK, want chime link...

The wearing *a* face mask political stance. wearing *Biden* face mask is.

To use link say ""see, Trump right claim that,"" wrong.

Also, come on. apparently interview WSJ. concede media might bias Trump (deservedly so, opinion), imply WSJ would flat lie pathetic. fortunately covid greatest equalizer doesn’t subscribe ideology 2 weeks, healthcare collapse becomes plausible scenario states believe they’ll start rethink positions lockdowns Kind hard know believe Mr. Fauci said played importance masks due knowledge mask shortages. sir blatantly lied everyone soooo yeah think people going listen now... Brazil literally fucked. Completely fucked there's nothing leaders corrupt (like many) Also, decided crude you’re snarky remark “I’m smart enough know zombies aren’t real.” shit fuckface, using EXAMPLE. decided give real world ones instead. would totally buy one turn fancy floating college complete waterslide. Buuuuuuuut I’m poor. year.  majority deaths world wide pandemic within past 3 months. weak strong battle nonsense. media ignored people's temper tantrums never would've gotten trump. governor doesnt care. Hospitalization rates definitely going I'm at...

Testing going here, either.

Point is, think highly dependent *where*, nature *where*. Wow, that’s incredibly dismissive. Tell millions right can’t provide family pay goddamn bills. shitty leadership we’re told fend fuck can’t work? Jesus Christ privilege sub amazes me. trying catch US? sure people refusing wear mask ""muh freedoms"" people harass breastfeeding mothers grounds ""it's gross"" ""I want see that""..... yeah put comment, bad weird rant.

It matter personally support protesters not. matter agree message methods.

My point easiest thing police departments treat cops murder like teachers, janitors, fast food workers murder. *You allow it.*

There's nothing weird comments. obvious thing world. Good. fucking hate science. older people: Fox news start campaign saying according study made wear mask probably gay liberal

for young people: Lebron start selling masks asking 400$ piece, would instantly make mask look cool young idiots.

for rich people: Gucci make 4000$ mask, could show rich wearing exclusive mask.

for nerds: Apple release i-mask, works like normal mask white apple logo, design soooo coooool, like crappy masks

for perverts: sell used masks worn female japanese students. meant daily increase. today 50k 160k total, third. USA used adding daily new cases Brazil taken past two weeks, seems accelerating Brazil. would awesome grandpa. suspect 50k cases day July 4th. End first week July latest.

There’s runaway freight train 5-10 states, we’ve made drop northeastern cases point. What's Tulsa like, days? Umm... no? Ah. Good catch lol basically every mouth breathing fat American Maybe dermatographia? mask rubbing skin could causing it. could also sensitivity mask material. according ignorant people, “freedom = ignorance good knowledge” people (the wrong people) see form submission. also might see compassion others weakness. wasn’t insulting you. giving real world examples. didn’t know that. know USA using call based system. working on. somewhat similar graph. far numbers got chart shown FL COVID press conference today. screenshot really sure post here. thoughts EXACTLY.

Agreed, there's two genders. Scientifically proven! OMG. read Feminism article. Horrifying. insult? point study shows masks prevent spread covid? course nothing.  Wondering likely husband exposed today. Details:

Tuesday evening: husband’s coworker played basketball group. 
Wednesday: someone basketball (I call A) experienced fever sore throat. got tested covid. husband worked home day. 
Thursday 8-10am husband’s coworker office. Husband large office room 1 hour sitting 15 feet apart. 
Thursday 10am: tests positive notifies coworker. Coworker leaves work get tested tells everyone office going on. follows saying receive results tomorrow morning. 

My husband supposed hosting grandparents (who 80s), sister infant Saturday house. Sunday birthday going hike. 

How would proceed? 

My take: 
If coworker tests positive, fill family let decide still want come over. 
If test negative, don’t see point telling them. However:
I think somewhat likely Hub’s coworker it, testing 36 hours exposure may give false negative. Would (coworker) infectious 36 hours exposure, assuming it? question goes husband family coming Saturday.

You responded saying saving lives right choice.

I said “I agree, maybe long run could saved lives first spike scary enough make people take serious. would higher spike less long term death.

You said, lockdown needed government implement figure convince people afterwards.

To said, lockdown wouldn’t followed unless people trusted government. People resist unless believe government protecting helping.

Covid soon replace word irony far see article collection statistics indisputable facts. think 'there start panic'? read article- Nature right? give compelling argument rigorously reviewed.

Top parties villainizing other, voters pushed side's extreme, got broken mess US political system, party ahead people, also ahead science. point spread inevitable. whole reason “masks” never stop virus, people somehow got idea stop people getting it......that ship sailed.

All masks slow spread, keep healthcare system good shape. protect you, protect system.

Eventually , people get virus kill off. people left adequate spread.

The vaccine going help time gets here. money maker drug companies. us immunity then.

It’s folly think wearing mask, mostly incorrectly ,that cannot filter virus particles small, going anything stop spread people interacting mass scale. done initiative. Schools closed regionally school itself, maybe municipality. decentralization about. sense it’s good. backside chaos increase testing example. let natural selection work magic.

1- don’t overextended yourself! There’s simply need, use time really appreciate relaxation. body isn’t good time, knows it’s doing. 

2- drink fluids! virus dehydrating, making sure you’re getting enough electrolytes make feel lot better! Especially you’re experiencing GI symptoms. 

3- take multivitamin, zinc, vitamin c! (Again ask doc recommend) eat, try eating foods know good you! Right ever, eat.

Lockdown contact tracing tools, contact tracing useless things spiral control. isn’t hyperbole, there’s reason disease literally one four horsemen apocalypse. People know die. Hello, Illinois family New Jersey. *extremely* cautious think family reasonably cautious- wear masks public interact large groups. dad going work, largely alone room, Zoom meetings laptop. family indoor interactions close family friends, however. considering driving home stay family week. think low-risk scenario? would stop gas stations pump gas gloves N95 mask, would go inside gas station- blunt, going pee car (I tried true methods!!!) I’ve saving much makeup pandemic! wear buff around neck pull pass people. long supposed last? Actually, I'm surprised scientific community needs peer-reviewed double-blind placebo randomized study prove whether something true not. However, reasonable use precautionary principle everyone wear face coverings soon possible rapid-spreading epidemic get golden study. Hong Kong Taiwan masked early since January, low infection rates despite high population density.

The original source evidence also YouTube video: point video briefly summarize study, reveal became mainstream news. I’m Colorado noticed trend. see videos places like NY (the one crowds convertible) think could people wear masks. Hopefully huge push media celebrities get people wear masks. California Institution Men, Chino. Capacity ~2900 indicates 0.5% population died. It’s fucking brutal  people saying want abolish police complaining police enforce brand new government created public dress policy. Hmmmm..
 

And police well people wearing masks clear. would expect cases spike? 

Anyone watching since beginning knows huge spike coming urban suburban areas CA.  second act.. Paywall  honestly hiking trail woods one places would feel like *could* take mask enforcement rules, protests, local governments voted accelerate reopenings. Police involved non-violent crimes r/Masks4All welcomes political affiliation! want everyone masked defeat thing! ""presumably homeless"" 


If homeless likely keeping mask pocket. add masks food giveaway hand door. hospital? though would’ve made news? get fax *know* came hospital. Swedish midsummer weekend, they're probably busy infecting other. Even Dr. Tengele told take easy interesting see goes. guess luckily people risk group already dead maybe bad. really say that? point admit lost war containing virus work toward living it? Hawaii maybe. going explain would surprised second time click link. Even rare definitely non zero, Id rather cover bases. That's manage risk.
I take care myself, cannot make every idiot see take care themselves, others like moment. That's job recognize actions affects others around then.
Look covid pee pants analogy read SARS MERS pls. Contact representatives, especially state local. Contact often. economy bad neighbors much worse metrics

What data back up? Especially second claim. Yes, test, number likely change. However, does, can’t say go down. know currently at. population gets tested, stable numbers become.

I’m simply stating current death rate tests results right now. more, less. Dude high you? You’re making logical leaps kangaroo moon couldn’t match. know, Right. guy also think world globe Mob mentality? won’t work USA. can’t even agree wear damn mask. OP, post r/coronavirusGA also? not, please do. Thanks! Good, let problem solve itself. California problem well, growth explosive past two weeks. 

About two weeks ago, California averaging 3,000 new cases per day. week, close 4,000 per day. time period Florida gone 1,300 per day 3,200 Texas gone 1,700 3,500.

California went 33% Texas Florida increased 100%. That's biggest difference.

California also address problem, people worried problem getting way control. One headline says _refused_ wear mask, says removed flight admitting _didn't like_ wearing masks.

Which it? entire world: china's fault 

China: Europe's fault! Except keep spreading devastating viral disease might even know week catch it. that, completely pointless. wiped big Mac ass tossing too.... Free market work. make airline wants make rules. I'm sure supports AA refusing service anyone ""practices different beliefs"". 100% correct here. Palm Beach county, one worst counties virus, don’t even require masks worn public, encouraged. result, many people wearing since feel we’ve beaten thing since President, governor, county leadership, etc. focused reopening economy saving lives. allow multiple large conventions take place precautions?
 
Lol, JK. fine one idea viruses spread back then. February. conservative terrorists* George Washington born Virginia.... whole monument.... birth there.... Sweden disaster... piece shit dude salesman know told 10 people knows died, went planes different times. hit random random dildo starts going work? Pretty sure cops better things mask police No! Hahahahahaha...I wonder, fooling who?  disagree there's political aspect this, one side's leadership particular wants bury heads sand, also seen point politics ban. someone always marked little R voter registration card make feel alienated go online find information staying safe deadly virus. also cuts ways, arguably _should_ feel uncomfortable side handling everything right now.  American ignoring science facts?

Because trained so. Foreign Intelligence service, traitors useful idiots established last 40 years.

""As mentioned before, exposure true information matter anymore. person demoralised unable assess true information. facts tell nothing, even shower information, authentic proof, documents pictures. ...he refuse believe it... That's tragedy situation demoralisation.""
–Yuri Bezmenov read constitution

You American, born America, president. Per constitution. really dense? Even subject colonial oversight. Puerto Rico sovereignty. Yes, clearly person's sanity “I travel time,” said. “I’ve never worn mask. It’s never come up.”

Yes, intelligent. traveled without mask *in before-times* never issue. too. Get fucking grip. Last time flew first week March 2020 (Cancun FLL PVD) nobody asked wear mask either. Guess what? *the before-times*. actually end times. Shit's changed since then. mean anyone mouth technically I'm volunteering. friend believed walk away thing much we're friends anymore. Every day would share Russian trolls post would Google disprove. got exhausting. Sounds like PPE around parents grandparents going norm anti-body testing expands. never said was. study carried highly respected research group, involved large numbers patients results conclusive - saves lives. 

Which good thing pandemic. formal debate. Quit lazy. Regardless whatever cool logic fallacy concept read wikipedia I'm obligated tell anything. ignorance problem solve. everyone clapped. 

Isn’t meme /r/thathappened ? I'm avoiding downtown like plague (excuse pun) several weeks around time....

fuck state city leadership, show everybody priorities lie .... 

Representatives people? think Welp, government can't much bail now. Wonder there's regret. Well, California blaming numbers testing. Meanwhile testing rate 60% higher Texas. expected population 10 million TX would cases. Florida well testing half population CA much older demographic numbers looking really bad. CA perfect response C19, no. least implemented mandatory mask usage. big deal (at least US) way late spike cases. math show herd immunity involves lot deaths. compare Sweden neighbours, hardly reached even 10% seropositivity countrywide. 

They better people. Nicely done enough decision makers see original non-policy would problem first place? course COVID real, existential threat it’s made be.

It’s extremely outrageously obvious disease primarily affects elderly immune compromised (which obviously isn’t people) justify bringing global economy screeching halt endangering lives billions people plunging world unprecedented state economic despair.

The declared pandemic situation obviously overhyped pretext collapsing world economy purpose, order centralize control — classic social engineering strategy creating problem, offering solution order control outcome.

Gates’ malicious intent also insanely evident, reason people believe he’s genuinely well-intended person man literally pays boatloads money marketed public consumption.

I much believe efforts field philanthropy whitewash PR stunt make appear noble good guy actually cares well-being society, whatever — it’s strategy literally invented Rockefellers, Gates openly admits borrowing major inspiration.

Not mention, man previously admitted plain English personal vision reduce global population use vaccines.

Do honestly believe one single richest sketchiest “philanthropists” planet actually gives fraction fuck poorest downtrodden world, person would want even pay big money perceive actions order get away malicious agenda wouldn’t otherwise board with? 0-44 less likely insured retirees. They're less likely know underlying conditions alter risks.  clearer picture physical health people seeing doctors regularly. Ignorance medical advice/science, stemming long term lack care, problem USA. also compare number pregnant cows Alaska, still make right. taking whatever statistics find fits story going it. genius came idea size population main criteria comparison? Czechia population Sweden well, compare them? 31 deaths per million (Sweden 505 btw!). Ok, Greenland? They're almost exactly size Sweden. Oh wait, deaths! cherrypicking whatever statistics come across looks like supports narrative upvotes Swedish mental gymnastics brigade troll farms spreading dishonest nonsense people understands even less statistics do. is!! That's point. assumptions. expert epidemiologist here. surgeon general directly responsible this. planted seed masks unnecessary people's head, that's remember. horrific decision mislead American people resulted us infected country world. “I’m tacitly rooting global pandemic return area it’s already ravaged feel right.” Yeah, like said doctor. also dont trust finding much either sure hell going bet life them. Mask gloves time---unless alone outside home. could possibly justification this? frustratingly short sighted stupid. mean honestly 2.5x much worse consider fallout worldwide lockdowns. ~1 million dead worldwide, even ended 5 million dead worldwide, would hard argue worse price lockdowns, expected kill many millions worldwide, including hundreds thousands children more. ""I heard friend"" that's dead giveaway ""I read internet"" lied honest. like Sweden. really might sound strange.. but

I expected Sweden control. government fix masks, ventilators, quick ""nanny"" us this. got furious suddenly see 5000 deaths.. old people abandoned even allowed hospitalized (there scandals this) beds empty. Since country ""individual responsibility?"" 5000 people die thats when. Holland absolutely, Portugal, Greece, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Italy, looot European countries that. Sweden. NOOO.. dont trust us jack shit here. thats going for, fine. pandemic shall liberal trust data... *Hand up* Yea weed legislation pandemic over? Nope. [I killed bill today, dont want that. people become drug .Their exact words pandemic. Yeah...AFTER they've possibly infected everyone flight. thanks. flying long time then. Riddle  Lmao, what????? want jump lockdown because..... Hopefully political, whoever refuses wear mask, wrong you? Good. kinds glasses even close ideal preventing infection.

Buy swimming goggles. flew AA today annoyed still selling full flights social distancing. send email saying flight “busy” want to, schedule different flight. wanted fights sold full it’s game

I one red neck looking dude without mask keep getting extremely close family Tampa airport finally stop tracks tell way close me. 

He apologized backed almost like waking around daring someone say something him. It’s fucking weird  What? Yes is. Great, routed Seattle. don’t need people don’t believe SARS COV 2 helping prevent spread. ""Activist""? like fucking moron I'm doctor I'm sure try remember explanation, I'll get wrong.

I've sent message restate writing provide it! surprise. Europe likes bring disease countries. herd immunity work wear masks? works winter shit Sherlock  Realistically number cases best measure situation going heavily dependent number people want get tested distinguish severity. Getting ton asymptomatic positives mild symptom positives nearly bad getting hundreds admitted hospital every day. long healthcare system keep up, situation devolve chaos. imagine different eating piece human skin. every single map, obesity, family breakdown, education level end looking like vote map? huh? called virolation people die it. Controlled smallpox virolation used kill 10% early Manchu adopters figured make safer. Covid virolation might safer Covid infections safe enough human trials. going enforce though? Police gonna beat people wont? ok, new talking point cases young people get number from? I've trying find good source show percent positive rates state able find one. least one shows positive rate time. read headline TULSA thought much money city going make weekend! exactly lettuce, fun: surprising would see diminished complete absence antibodies 2-3 years. original comment said memory cells present 6 years exposure, meaning exposed body would blueprint virus produce appropriate antibodies fight it. enforce flight though? want sit next dumbass takes mask. Everybody start somewhere! people 10 chin ups started able 0 first :)  fear mongering all. 


And antibody test positives put actual number cases? Maybe accuracy tests dismal best? okay snowflake Uhh... normal distribution, IQ one classic perfect cases normal distribution. work like case. Mostly test designed behave manner.

For IQ mean median same, 100.

Exactly half mean value 100, outliers really matter... give Thinkers! Hope Pyongyang nice time year course scientist would say that. /s think unites banner much wink nudge racism folksy speaking style. Sounds like damn good start me. state's dashboard counties meeting state standards at: report San Diego meeting reopening thresholds low positivity rate exempts us stricter case-count limit. proper threshold apply 100 cases per 100,000, 25 per 100,000 LA Times states. think kids putting masks themselves? aliens. 

Lol Bro chill.. one close friends patient know value lives patients. even clock link bored quarantine want online argument.

Like said, MoH gives official count official announcement. live website give count midnight midnight. knows long I'll contagious? :/ I'm sure there's sure way knowing want take chance so...
Yes, still plan it. feel XD Texas isnt south...its Texas XD alot people def see way. pride awesome state =D atm...sadface...very upsetting im scared go work but...need money D= Lol... superintendent already said open like normal able. TEA puts “recommendations”... won’t following them.

And announcement wasn’t met worried responses parents... overly happy excited.

I guess proves world one day ends, won’t happen cries panic... it’ll end sound cheering masses. none stupid willfully embrace stupid.

Ignorance fixed stupid forever

Blind faith bad leadership patriotism Previous generations ignorant mortality? Uh oh boys. Looks looks like got kinda revenant McCarthyist roaming about. Hide children lock wife's underwear drawer! known fact. cant figure 2nd virus people new infection weird resurgence first infection (up months later).

Either scary , deal fact either true, major brearhing p100 ventilator, face shield, eye protection closed areas, bunch supplement health protocols . transmission goes certain point shelter home 4 6 weeks, qbout Ga . want risk multi organ failure death.  Why? longer time spread covid it? know someone like this. can't use STOP anything. Takes large paragraph yammering finally come would like that. Well everyone gets bored finish reading yammering good. thinks he's wonderful proze. Ha! Whoooosh.

My position is: listen experts. don’t know bearing. I’m subject matter expert neither she, folks feel fit challenge people PhDs multi-decade careers specific space. Rather 'own', 'uphold' 'respect'. respect Fauci, idea told people wear masks would shortage 100% lie. followed closely, said regular masks work N95 masks did. N95 even bigger shortage time still short supply. live, still commercially available regular masks everyone made fabric. Which, way, could done Day 1. Death lags. Death rate grows hospitals fill, currently doing. I’m highly skeptical haven’t heard lag death rates already. I’m congratulating figuring internet it’s obvious brain working overtime even get first place. reopened soon...after closed 2 months. Makes sense. little while. expect infection point around 25-30th June. bet he’s member “law order” party. 1. replying me. 

2. coronavirus sub, pandemic. Serves reminder animals carry Corona - even country zero human cases, mean there's Covid country. Man feel another lockdown coming on... I’ve seen posts people talking relatives overly causal virus. direction? relatives think world over, they’ll never able retire, etc. Whatever life isn’t over. However, one aunt that’s way acts completely different 
-March: go work *”you’re gonna kill mom (whose another state)”* Turns shes also going work

-June: Maybe thinking seeing friends state. *”you need quarantine two weeks”*. Turns she’s like five states past month

If strong beliefs fine, don’t hypocrite provided evidence numbers

I've addressed twice. used number thread. mine. Dont know source. didnt provide them. Ask guy. Dunno. Hope covers it.

If dont explanation excess deaths, that's fine, asking. IMAGINE ANTI SCIENCE... dont kno whats worse... 

USA sort out. Someone needs make meme Abbott riddler, piece shit. Governor ferrari kiss ass, negligent piece shit crazy thing since America Epicenter Covid, people can’t flee countries amid civil unrest. America fucked. Civil war looming. Trump somehow wins November Chauvin somehow doesn’t get convicted masses hoping for? GG mean 3 months ago made post saying SARV-CoV2 ""of little concern"". made post US 3,600 cases 58 deaths. 


Now we're 2 MILLION cases 120,000 deaths. 


At point balls admit wrong?? 


The really pathetic part spent literally everyday since running around downplaying trying convince somehow still right. paid can't imagine much loser real life, seriously, lives like that? mean, would unique chicago, yeah? I’ve actually seen people say time, seems like coincidence. lot people get strep like year, around time. I’m doctor, I’d imagine tonsils get inflamed/get spot mild things. Try stress! Good paying attention body. main argument manly, whatever fuck means. Let someone say Eddie Bravo wants know location No, lives we've loss last months due COVID elderly people underlying health conditions. Illinois alone, 53% COVID deaths nursing homes. Murica would Wuhan new world. Wife teacher texas. I'm worried going get get it. also going decimate teachers, many old risk people teachers. going thin herd many schools. would help since would essentially immune virus continue live lives without fear virus infecting them.

There *no* definitive evidence yet. know certain means you’ve before. need testing research, however currently is. Research. results positive, means previously COVID-19 infection. yet know positive test result means person immune, does, long immunity might last. hope learn coming months. Reported cases... Everyone says stay home needs say yes wearing mask. Northern Ireland reported 3 cases today 1 case yesterday. Believe not, want travellers coming either.  LOL. Ok, nothing. tinfoil fodder. Next!  “We’re rolling back,” DeSantis said news conference Tuesday asked whether would consider stopping reopening efforts. “The reason mitigation protect hospital system.“

Faulty logic part DeSantis. point protecting hospital system means reduce unnecessary injury death. \*also\* want continue prevent community spread long possible better treatments (not vaccines) continue developed \*before\* people get infected. achieving \*also\* prevent unnecessary injury death. mention that's factoring many people purposefully avoiding gatherings taking precautions despite imposed top see ignorant is? 

We literally endless knowledge fingertips yet still rely someone send article. could try pick apart without even attempting see real yourself. 

You probably would started telling dude wrong sources wrong linked anything. 

“If want something done yourself” state, they’ve done studies show averaging 33k tests per day. average 19k. know fact state ramping testing way should. 300million people country. state Florida 21 million alone. 26 million tests great long we’ve testing. Russia almost caught USA month half. think people also forgetting official death numbers inaccurate well. They're estimated current case numbers reported deaths (which related cases two weeks prior). causing numbers used denominator big numerator small.

There's good way know many cases have, want decently accurate rate, we'd need total cases two weeks prior current total deaths. possibly look excess deaths see accurate toll. says so?  symptoms COVID earlier week (Sunday - Wednesday). fever gone 2 days now. went got tested Tuesday, gotten results back. 


My question is, go get tested *again* fever symptoms gone, would show positive? don’t want alarm anybody, global daily deaths trending since mid April.

What ever happened “screaming fire I. crowded theater” argument? We're already en route one...not looking good there. ""Those truckers us way,"" Trump said. ""They're protesting favor President Trump opposed against.""

Protesting favor? 

In beginning always thought ""no, really say that"". even check more. Dont forget eventually claim scapegoated past actually side. Example: Jesus Christ Abraham Lincoln.

If particular loss sanity, make claims lynched recent previous weeks. I'm thinking people bars restaurants inside masks MUCH higher percentage question one would ignore going nationwide type protests absolutely calmed volume. Serves fucker right homework. Im saying press conferences nothing wrong since February. 60k-120k deaths mentioned one point. Americans listening nothing info leading worst handling pandemic country. many people don’t care Manhattan Brooklyn. sucks bc see lot people wear them. works everyone cooperated like me. wear mask ask protestors (mostly white) gathered protest governor wearing masks? No? Oh, ok. guess I'm confused think case person make sense say case age way suggested here. hehe. Someone angry. better It’s 1 7,000 virus Florida today odds get worse time goes on. 

But yes humans die lot ways. new way addition previous ways. 

All restaurants required law post Heimlich maneuver chart. 

Florida also requires mandatory gun safety course purchase firearm. 

When deaths compound don’t throw hands air hope best. I'm talking rubbing butt groin things. I'm talking simply dropping drawers. public health reason prohibited. keep crotch covered. basically acknowlege 'getting off' example. Seeing someone erection, itself, issue public health concern. creepy require people cover up.

There clearly public health threat walking sidewalk, social distancing, completely naked erection. I'm still going jail makes people feel uncomfortable.

For record, I'm suggesting allow people walk around names. fact, virtually nobody is, despite public health reason allow it.  read it, links DHS website. tab pulling info from? [FL currently enforcing quarantine order travelers NY, NJ, good goose. So, date expect see April New York State level cases every day, tens thousands? That's ERs juuuuuuust reaching capacity places like Florida.  Anecdotal I’ll definitely reply results come in! agreed. point. agree masks also, people complain refuse wear mask meekly remove shoes submit scanning. Seems like double standard activist, terrorist\* odds least one super spreader favor. Especially “virus hoax” crowd likely attend even feeling weather see Florida taking steps yet.

Expect variant governor president: ""there's way anyone could predicted would get bad we'd need many ICU beds!"" Yes, are, since contact someone tested positive, go get tested (about 5 days last contact, really).

We far need contact tracing, improves see lot testing asymptomatic presymptomatic people. place always packed. me, rest stop always seemed packed ones turnpike. Sorry, English only. Stay golden doomy boy. noticed time Arizona Wisconsin bars seem worst places. restaurants retail establishments really trying right thing, bars DGAF absolutely agree. people must think masks like magic mirror stop germs going one way, other. LoL respect opinion big brother. I'm officer would done same. people died ship ships company put blame captain know would still fired. Put man's shoes try throw book NC looking fantastic either. look good ambassador flexing ridiculous numbers authority.

She must consulted home government presenting information, guess wanted frame debate incorrectly.  Croizer publish tell book, nothing holding back now. Also, break chain command, read, followed rules, somebody else leaked E mails, him. really called activism you’re flaunting stupid dipshit ideas are?  Also... March June 1 get tested age 60 unless hospital. 

Now we're testing younger people.

None means anything though. Young people virus March too. test them. 

These clickbaity headlines make hard keep track places really spiking guy..... hear him, like him. I'm American, would leader day. zero chance know certainty. takes awhile symptoms show infected. estimate may different now, used time period two weeks estimating.  asthma triggered? Legit question, asthma always curious others adult asthma.

&amp;#x200B;

(FWIW, never issues wearing mask even though asthma fairly uncontrolled.) air marshal taser taking care of. Lock up... strategy seems push herd immunity fast possible without overloading hospitals.

It's inherently awful idea believe we're getting vaccine time soon, eventually people going exposed long enough time frame anyway. 

The issue absurdly risky go line, *way* people going die needed to. Basically states like Florida either going come looking like geniuses absolute fucking idiots, almost possibility between. believe that's silver bullet, lol? aware ireland shares border northern ireland right? mean.. test positive havent got worst thing happen yoi self isolate 3 weeks get bored listen shitheels like Dr. Oz take essential oils want to. Trying pretend like medical professionals single monolith silly, especially they're dealing new disease rapidly-changing data, like trying pretend acknowledgement risks political activity somehow invalidates *all advice* also silly. Stop trying force world black white outcomes around stuff better time. mean can’t get selfish suck wear mask. 
 
I work clinic people take patient temperatures, ask questions, give masks enter per policy. Every schmuck come saying it’s right wear mask it’s tyrannical us force to. 

1.	It’s private clinic, no, it’s tyranny
2.	the amount vulnerable people come clinic everyday quite high. people getting even flu would problematic 
3.	is hard wear mask? Everyone else it. experts somehow wrong doesn’t work, wore rag face hour. It’s big deal 

If think wearing mask matter politics, words. Really depends surface. Turns cotton actually quite inhospitable reason, masks made pillowcases T-shirts effective initially thought. checked popular Covid Truthers lately I'm wondering Brensen ES explaining away new rise cases. I'm almost positive likely solely focusing falling (national) death rate - yeah contortions go say real big deal highly amusing - unfortunately many people buy bullshit. course is; rocket science. 

Multiple industries effectively dead right now(at least pandemic). industries limping along. PPP loan period runs out, going layoffs. economic damage keep compounding people money spend.  Coronavirus breathes sigh relief... Absolutely. need know mass gathering attended else contact tracing pointless. mean can’t get selfish suck wear mask.

If think wearing mask matter politics, words. stupid open time also make masks optional. Wtf? Whatever happened taking things slowly? Masks mandatory return opening back prevent this, surprise things spiking hard. idiots got taste losing mind cause they'd rather catch corona wear mask around people 🙄 Nice! like it, it’s clean vaccine first given people travelling China essential business trips abroad. worry, turn use it. becuase dont like response make accurate. logic, would fair say we, country, able understand facts truth since 70's 80's? fuck hilarious. ever come these? Ok someone middle beating shit someone bat. gets them? 两个星期，美国傻逼 talking NY, Florida. Yes talking whole country 49 states matter also. Nationally tested 26 million people. nearly enough have. Sorry Florida keeping up, state issue. haven’t testing more? actual quote source? need stay job, essential workers. He's acting like special little snowflake air travel *American* right. international, ignorant Americunts! clue talking about. spray painted mayor Seattle's house today. many new anti police movement want abolish police, many people would think lot people claimed well. does, Texas ton new cases people want try it, he's got people try they're willing.  ""too."" Hmm..perhaps ask r/outside. Could system glitch. /s love cedar point went would wear mask, even though uncomfortable. see open safely. many people wear mask correctly? Especially hot hell outside. even want think handrails packed lines. 

This unrelated one thing always grossed getting ride seat sweaty damp. hope person water ride? would love go year people take seriously. Calm down. even law city mandate places. sound deranged. Campuses close. thinking arbiter science.

Lol, project much?

Congrats, still doesn’t make medical doctor, virologist, epidemiologist. excuse side-step sad attempt strut credentials definitive excuse ignore experts. Nah, never reason get tested now. actually found blood donation drive. I'm usually scared needles, finding blood type+free covid antibody test+critical blood shortage made worth facing fears. fuck sake play year. People need common sense. need tv ads something.... don’t take mask talking people.... doubt help. I'm torn think really important. Two crises collided really compatible. say protesters without masks aholes, maybe little less aholish someone yoloing bar, put damn mask on. Yes, that's getting ban. keep rule mind, please. really resurgence? Deaths haven’t climbing. They’ve falling nationwide. 

It’s three weeks since nationwide protests rise cases doubt that. protests large younger people recover get sick all. 

I’m highly skeptical resurgence narrative. Borders closed, dude. Good luck. call stupidity denial reddit, trying sensible? Okay, basic math now. shows 130.3k excess deaths late february (when right baseline) 5/30.  tested deaths country 105,793 point. arguably means 24k untested collateral deaths. However tested deaths could lag days could make difference.

This includes 700 deaths day (4901 total) week 5/24-5/30. 7-day average tested deaths period 984. quite confusing, seems indicate collateral deaths week negative two thousand. things considered, would good news think. Collateral deaths getting hand would one main worries pandemic drags people put necessary hospital visits. course less travel lots people unemployed staying home, large subset accidental deaths gone.

(CoV sources worldmeters: Everyone legal expert epidemiologist economist contact trace thousands new cases day

That's I'm wondering... seems like daunting task wife registered gun owners Germany, grew Canada too. rules Germany Canada concerning gun ownership storage remarkably similar. 

Per capita gun ownership countries almost too, Germany 1/3rd population USA (and almost 3x population Canada), packed country half size Texas. Germany ""American Gun Culture"". means one neighbors probably owns gun, know it.

There gun club within walking distance live, inside old bomb shelter. Almost nobody knows there, right inside city. 

As registered owners inspection ""at time"", practical purposes every 10 years. recent inspection couple months ago officer happier us. revolvers hidden safe ammunition stored another room.

My Dad competitive Canada internationally teenager (a long time ago). system bit different Germany ""win way up"", order get invitation next level. wife competitive Bavarian State Championships. invited 3x, almost 5 years lived there.

Anything else would like know about? It’s simple word filter **The Farmed Mink.**

An animal - nature forced humans cohabiting isolation every species planet - *except humans* \- contracted coronavirus.... from, eh.. ... humans.

Now, species Mink must systematically destroyed species gave disease.

Even though may ability pass back humans.

Even though locked essentially concentration camps contact outside world - pretty much zero ability so...

...... MUST DIE!!!!!

You know.. case.. because, well, know.. Coronavirus shit.

Welcome latest stage Covid-1984.. **The Farmed Mink Holocaust.** We'll figure out. Hawaii arresting people violating quarantine document. stopping NY same?  get relief you?

Wyd. 

By wearing masks directly providing relief governor, making county covid situation less due actively wearing masks less transmissions. Fucking idiot yep..true... Facts big guy need better education! Start scientific method mindset early age! Get thinking correctly now! Everyone wear mask force force vaccinations. Protect freedom. Welding people apartments worked great China, really consider it. **Foxnews launched 1997** Good thing included direction they're saying ""hi"" from. Millions based rates infectivity death. It’s one thing criticize word “could” it’s used scaremonger every possible eventuality. It’s another thing it’s supported entire scientific community, based hard facts models. 

And millions start dying, economy fucked anyways. Nobody’s going bar they’ve got 103 degree fever grandma dying. ""They've lied."" ""they"" government, entire body scientists. 

For last question, same, rational, Tucket Carleson watchers do, go read journals research. much it. Lol. Removing post mentioned medical supply chain stats. Ahahaha. Stupid bot. Literally one saying abolish police Fun rhetoric, that's really works. least worked target grocery stores, ""here's jobs 40 week, okay go"" like ""do this, this, this, this."" 

Checkers, instance, checking 40 hours worth customers. They're still checking 28 hours worth customers. Softlines putting 40 hours worth baby clothes 28 hours. They're still putting stock comes in, like usual. get accomplished one person's day gets pushed next person. literally talking bar hopping bars alllll around country open. Literally.  Isn’t exploding = testing though? Western country started testing seriously cases went roof. wear mask. It’s bad.. mean antibodies fades away, mean immunity. Told hoax. countries catching on. /s live? Literally see everyone masks montco bucks. Like 99% people unless park words, **""Foxnews problem US""** Unfortunately lot people don’t take coronavirus seriously. 

Albeit cruel horrible, might way people realize dealing here. Oh God no. There's website that, called Facebook. wish upon us. profile pics comes thirsty influencers. 700 friends!

They quite literally wanted die could turn economy back on. Still do, we're completely honest - everything reopening right vastly premature practically non-existent level testing we're doing. they're *still* pressing rhetoric, even today. Yes think know it’s joke get it... lol else read voice? This. read Homeland Security pandemic plan. stresses education. There’s list could happen, strategies mitigate, etc. last pandemic plan made 2006. major element communicating &amp; educating public. happened. Newspapers write stories sell (Remember even NYTimes printed stories saying masks helped healthcare workers) don’t seem care true. Start false narrative, it’s hard step back it. lot Americans left decide what’s true choose what’s convenient. Someone needs get ass gear dig pandemic plan &amp; it. It’s crazy ton medical studies showing EVERYONE wearing masks greatly reduces spread covid yet way family &amp; friends know stuff I’m reading things &amp; disseminating info. I’m doctor scientist. I’m English Lit major. teacher. writer. I’d like get person again. girl isn’t trying get everyone loves listen don’t act like asshats and/or die covid. middle name might well insomnia. Also, I’m John Boy Walton rant, someone give Fauci back microphone. commercial Fauci &amp; Schwarzenegger educating people? Someone it. public supposed educated message FACTS reached every person. Maybe people would wear masks start acting like part community. We’re together whether like scroll Dept Homeland Security site, you’ll see link says :

“PDF icon Pandemic Influenza Preparedness, Response, Recovery Guide Critical Infrastructure Key Resources	PDF”

Click &amp; read it. It’s long, you’ll see wrong things gone. news? virus everywhere still relatively contained. people never interact known group people, day day out. people travelling widely. Infections stay isolated way. 

It usually super spreaders take virus spread one community next. case far novel Coronavirus. early explosion due business men travelling different regions world.

For example super spreader spreader acts differently normal people, case man tested positive know infected. SINGLE day visited 4 super markets, several large gatherings within city.

It even visiting many places, visited different regions, one end city end.

That super spreader. Many cases isolated someone travel patterns habits like take virus spread beyond limited scope started with. assume Chinese citizen though? guy went high school posting FB deaths made up, flu much worse, doctors scientists lying virus. remember dude failed high school biology. work. Wearing mask properly socially distancing works. direct quotes people forget this? everywhere. really pretty despicable human yet he's one wholesome reddits poster boys. Exactly willing accept fact wrong, trying rational best mental compromise come admit ones behaving like idiots months way around like originally believed. literally wrong lmao. He's said several times, explicitly, wearing mask manly America stain world stage. Absolute embarrassment country hanging pandemic especially bullshit politics transcends common sense. risk 6 years schooling, 10 years schooling earn extra bucks could probably get anyway He’s single handily blame current dire economic situation grossly overestimated models fatality rate 3-4% reality confirmed it’s 0.4%.

Buy N99 masks find buy North Face 7700-30 P100 filters. can, crazier karma, star small build long good message 1.) specifications provided ""masks."" Neither feds least state govt (California.)

2.) Without sport specification, there's way determine wearing helping anything all.

3.) great many, forcing masks onto others become obsessive fetish. People bound dismiss people. others political issue. Again, people naturally resist.

4.) sneeze cough contained good better help handkerchief one's arm. They're disproportionately poorer less educated.

They go more, tend work jobs going shut give shit employee health, even less access things like masks regular people do, worse health understanding.

It's black people affected, poor people blacks make disproportionately high number poor citizens. Heat slows spread? hottest year Florida right virus booming. People need realize. “secret” known dozen people, start leaks. covid huge hoax, you’d people saying aren’t seeing increased icu usage, it’s bs. Guess what?

Immunity idol: PAPR bunny suit it’s exact opposite America. Somebody told comes government, assume stupidity otherwise proven. keep wondering federal government cant mandate every state wears them, maybe can, unfortunately people power dont care. saw today Trumps rally require face masks, require sign waver saying wont sue get covid rally. took dont care gets dies. long campaign reelection public safety takes backseat. Sorry mean make political, frustrated cant wear masks. Arizona Dude, fuck place. Lines already 4 hours long even pre Covid. 10 years?

Goodbye.  worry, he's American. passport. thought exactly. Melbourne Florida, high elderly population, folks stopped wearing masks. places cut holes paper masks. Richmond, VA went Lowes last weekend staff wearing masks properly. nose exposed. chins! 

AMC going open theaters Richmond enforce 1/3 seating capacity makes point saying masks required. I'm going spending lot time home reading! 100% football game played year situation two weeks ago 

What's doubling rate? make clear really don’t want people die taking maximum precautions.

And I’ll probably lose $200k-$300k Florida property values drop due decreased demand.

But that’s reason pick water front property it’s available cheap, it’s good way offset pain current FL properties losing value.

I’d prefer FL took pandemic seriously I’m taking VA, screaming freedoms saving lives there. Nothing new Abbott. going homeschooling 3 kids, god save me, lol. don’t think ones would get sick would agree you. couldn’t imagine spending last months stuck ventilator suffering. It’s probably difficult part whole covid thing. people helped build country ones suffering 
Most. honestly don’t know solution is. people aren’t nurses aren’t qualified give kind care people nursing homes need, don’t equipment/setup it. end life, last months typically need constant skilled care. What's incredible Watson Florida, Texas, Arizona, dozen states actively surge thread people talk much country improving strategizing fill stadiums back get sports teams back do.

There's oxymoron That's one thought valid. OK, tired winning now. psychopathic fuckwit. I’d report animal cruelty knew were. Letting cat starve? Hope get virus disgusting piece shit. Stop giving moron attention. high think go?

I'm gonna say 5000 cases one day peak.

What got? ban sick people flying? I'm little lake noone wearing masks. saw maybe 10 percent people quick shopping run new puppy stuff yesterday. say medical condition, mean like got hoses going nose throat. get make shit up. Viral infections unimpressed legal loophole theory.  ""I raise"" - Lombardy served warning rest world seem real enough convince America.

Italy poorly done Imperial College model reasons US government took half-assed approach did. Cause expert Californian politics figured anyone smart enough find way Reddit could also type ""shwarzenegger corruption"" duckduckgo.com TIL Italian National Institute Health CCP propaganda arm. Clearly do, stfu put mask. See Caitlin Jenner seriously asking spike? paying attention.

texas, florida, oklahoma arizona massive spikes also open states.

in oklahoma we’ve broken daily record multiple times week, yesterday highest 450.

today hit 350. Wrong. need nails did. stealing TV target solves racism  Yeah. People crying protests gatherings there, shrug overall lax everyone even trying wear mask distance. Going restaurants. Shopping whole family. Going far away vacations... good thing live bubble cannot infect anyone community. goes prisoners also blamed increasing rates.

/s We’re stressed! fuck be? disagreeing saying; I'm concerned conferred immunity less 12 months drastically affect adoption rates. look Flu shots US; less half adult population get yearly basis. good person, perhaps. civic organizations could contribute identical ways don’t carry historical weight abuse hazing often (not always!) accompany activities. like people saying need Football exercise. 
Exercise good. need football it. Get NordicTrac, stop causing concussions, burn calories per hour. Texas California released Friday numbers yet? Today might record breaking day around.

I joked month ago US would country hit second wave finished first. looks like may right unfortunately. People deserve right live long life though, no?

Take look countries either par behind U.S successfully combating virus. Italy hotspot record low cases.

It's sad people trivializing people's lives, sad reality America. Building field hospitals would admission infection rates control hospitals overrun. allow that. They'll quietly picking bodies people die home. immediatly, no. information comes Worldometers delete info 3 days that's going help much now. know getting bad see BNO News tweet posted now. Remember daily BNO twitter post Italy, Spain, NY, UK, France? highly support this. That's inconsiderate people around you. entitled dumbass hurts yourself, free country whatever, entitled dumbass hurts people. Never get high supply?! Sigh. “Damn, wouldn’t pregnant didn’t take test!” Countries start look better pandemic shifts new countries, expected foreseeable. Yes cases rise horrible many countries lucky position ease restrictions open again. you’re admitting you’re gonna continue deflecting you’re original argument? I’ve never said protests aren’t infecting people, high chance spreading virus. don’t agree ignorance ppl aren’t wearing masks potentially spreading virus, commend minimizing chance spreading it. there, keep moving goal posts? actually respond stupid ass correlation  Like Arizona Arkansas better week two weeks ago!

What Arizona ""doing better"" two weeks ago? Pretty much [all ADHS suggests things gotten markedly worse. AMERICA! Number people tested... 1 like 4 people Die Benghazi? weird one throw there. schools supposed open 3 months? even bother opening can't even gather without getting corona? Basically 90% time college gathering people. point keep schools closed offer online classes highly reduced tuition. Du hättest sagen müssen „thank random citizen“ :D don’t understand all. Starbucks today, wore mask stood 2m behind person front get drink. Now, I’m suppose send kids back school month half without masks likely full classrooms. anyone tell makes sense? Abbott head hole seems pretend whole thing over. Trumps southern mouthpiece. Got reading that? number think correct then? case LA. Maybe 10% protesters aren’t wearing masks. Probably less. Never seen counter protester wearing mask though... reason catch predator could never TV. They're obviously dangerous. mean come 'predator' name. Safer leave get high supply Joe Rogan's podcast long form he's HUGE, people still enjoy long form things. think little spare time we're slaves jobs time something masturbatory reading something intellectual sake growth new perspectives help put food table roof heads. barely time kids day let alone sitting read actual book, even though love learning.

As far countries “dropping,” number things play there, want see actual data you’ve following. cabin-wide reminder captain would go long way. ""Airline X would like remind passengers masks required times. passengers wish remain maskless reminded banned flying Airline X flight."" problem students states coming in... fucking stupid politicize face mask? going fear wave swamps them. happened everywhere gotten hit bad. predictable death rates following infection rates. Someone better description Joe Rogan;

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* r/coronavirusUS data points trends - places investigate further. still wear mask everywhere. 

That said, what’s take brought Gabon Nigeria? Nigeria 90x population density 100x international traffic. tinder box virus. India too. Gabon test positive rates 18x higher. Gabon imports lots meat west; Nigeria ban it.

I think beef culprit bc people eat rare pink. Poultry pork always cooked way (and would surprised know it’s past, linked viral outbreaks?) 

The temperature solubility really important question. Maybe really matter eating beef well done months.

It also explains arbitrary outbreak heard small gatherings. know, party everyone got sick. Cruise ship passengers.

I think human human possible too, probably people symptomatic. know mainstream media says, think whole debate around asymptomatic transmission (at first main mode, told it’s minimal) probably result missing piece. They’re wondering people got sick without contact infected person. how. Struggling read smaller print bottom shirt pic. say ""but definitely gigantic cunt""? “I’ll tell what’s bottom it,” said. “If convince lowest white man he’s better best colored man, won’t notice you’re picking pocket.

Also, farmworkers actually blame, DeSantis closed industry down. heard like Gomorrah terms noone wearing masks. Good. idiot endangering everyone that. Yeah gonna convince reality. invite go YouTube search major city protest that's happened past 3 weeks look crowd tell tons tons people wearing masks. Yes there's lot wear them, many, more, dont.  needs curated. day! 500,000 dead people millions infected say no.....oh btw people don’t even wear n95 mask really simple. New Zealand it. can't we? won’t take seriously gets it. gets least bad Boris got it.  Governor says due Hispanic migrant workers. Next week he’ll blame demonstrators. Anything avoid suggesting simply reopened soon. Strap on. Summer coming. Financial Times:

Only fool breaks two-metre rule. mantra UK, painted pavements supermarket signage urge people stay two metres apart prevent coronavirus infection.

The rule review in UK, relief ministers business people foresee bleak future hospitality entertainment industry currently without critical mass customers. They favour World Health Organization’s one-metre recommendation, already adopted China, Hong Kong Denmark. decision due early July, sectors British economy scheduled reopen.

The fixation distance usefully highlights persistent theme public discussion risk: false, binary distinction safety danger. magic attaches either distance: countries, including Australia, Belgium Germany, opted one half metres.

The choice whether be safe two metres unsafe at one — whether want take risk less, end. Reopening economy virus conquered means governments taking tough decisions society function landscape uncertain risk.

Uncertainty not, however, mean junking precautionary principle, given Covid-19 still springing unwelcome health surprises. example, since know people carry virus without showing symptoms, must assume also transmit proven otherwise.

This most convincing argument for donning face coverings masks, especially indoors public transport, distancing difficult. is, mostly, act consideration towards others: face coverings prevent projection virus-laden droplets towards people surfaces, others pick (the recommends fabric coverings made three layers different materials, rather medical masks). 

Face coverings might also important given continuing disagreement airborne transmission (via aerosol particles finer droplets emitted coughs sneezes hang air longer). highly contested paper published last week suggested transmission likely dominant. Still, worth noting pro-mask attitude countries kept infection rates relatively low: shame copying measures seems rationale.

When comes social distancing, timing well distance critical. Spending six seconds one metre infected person carries roughly transmission risk spending minute two metres, according Patrick Vallance, chief scientific adviser UK government. risk continues fall distance. hope everyone paying attention who's making decisions remember comes time vote. hilarious state wants blame protest spike cases. think clear point. struggling two pandemics.

Covid stupid. Yes, sure :/ Mostly young people according NYT photos saw. damn shame.

But thing is, they’ve like since least May, haven’t really seen rise. I’m sure make that, maybe real spreader indoor events recirculating air. aren’t happening NYC (besides people’s apartments). right one? someone single lives alone, I’m 100% seeing psychiatrist this. anxiety level roof ~~activist~~ provocateur professional luddite. Enjoying literally killing others frowned upon among humans. That’s what’s actually happening story. 

What planet from? There’s difference conservative stupid. person stupid. Huge stuff! timelines??  Yep, states well seeing decreasing positive rates, also increased testing, PA first day 13k+ tests, saw 500 positive cases, every week positive rate decreases little.  did. state health department asked anyone wanted go get tested.

Uninsured persons COVID-19 needing hospital admission required law admitted hospital treated time longer require lifesaving care. Further, statistics across world borne younger populations significantly (even exponentially) less likely elderly. Claims contrary irresponsible degrade public trust. Underrated comment right here. wonder going work city /state mask requirement like Florida I’ve never seen many backwards baseball caps one place. Rural Lancaster County PA here. We've around 100-110 per 100,000 months little change.

People are, general, resistant masks here. county news multiple times cases per day rising faster counties much higher population, also refusing respect abide guidelines set governor health secretary. sometimes feel I'm person care.

He also deleted comment called “glass cleaner” told published systematic review experience reading analyzing papers result that, accused saying know scientists response comment said quote: “I’m *not* scientist don’t call one don’t PhD.”

He either illiterate troll. Neither one flattering. remember correctly sure first masks people touching faces (which bullshit excuse give someone mask). Pondered decision months testing decided mask better mask even touch it. think people stuck wearing mask they're fat, lazy amendment supposed trust government. 

It's working progress disease always uncharted territory way narritave going, me, seems like Americans believe someone seeing, withholding transendant valuable information great, grand, glorious american people fundamentally cannot trust changed mind. american attitude childish best.

It's hard criticize US.

NYC doesn’t herd immunity, friend. near enough infected. 25% tested positive antibodies, tests low specificity cross reacted coronavirus, CoV-SARS-2 (I physician NY taken antibody tests, fact positive initially tests used study everyone quotes “25%”, negative institution started carrying tests actually specific CoV-SARS-2. Many colleagues experienced same. study basically garbage needs redone since many people use fodder false claims). Even study accurate (its not), herd immunity doesn’t occur 25% infected. Also, NY isn’t place masks mandated drop observed. Simply dramatic example, along Lombardy Wuhan. Clearly read study. 


NC, SC, GA mandate masks never have. would love see actual data proving point it. 


There reason literally study supporting claim. Again, one prove wrong would love see it. Otherwise, claim purely anecdotal opinion again, supported data.


There reason many studies saying masks work. do.

You don’t need government tell wear mask. Wear mask. I’m honestly fascinated theatres managed convince us eat movie.

Airline employee: ""Sir, need wearing clothes board aircraft.""

Passenger: ""I'm afraid I'm unable that. medical condition preventing wearing clothes.""

Airline employee: ""Well didnt say so! case, welcome aboard!"" Daily New Deaths actually decreasing though weeks. maybe they're completely wrong.  Protests also outside. You’re ignorant. tantamount asking can't inject little bit HIV make stronger AIDS. 

But think that's valid question adult person ask go ahead. Biden political gatherings? one less 100 people? think that's comparable Trump wants. Read stats. - 6989 cases per million

Tests best metric, order magnitude differences. Also take antibody studies multiple sources divide antibody prevalence deaths per million, almost always get number 1%. understand would anyone assume know husband well enough would comfortable with.

Spring term's zoom classes really unpopular, students know really lose lot miss in-person classes. universities announced next year going entirely online, lot people would question whether worth paying full price tuition. all, students going learn online courses, plenty cheaper options available private even state schools. doubly true students paying high cost state tuition, many state schools hopelessly dependent on.

Universities face problem mass withdrawing courses last term closures happened suddenly unannounced. announced next year would entirely online, large numbers students would choose take gap years look affordable online options. Instead, want people sign expecting full priced, full value in-person education, move online weeks in. started.  People days really short term memory due internet.

Cases going people barely dying fake news. bam NYC ran death. Habit now. maintenence work. Covidvirus stays surfaces days, includes doorhandles everything store shelves. second nature change everytime go somewhere now. Probably use 10 pairs minmum daily. read comment someone listed multiple places get tested Monroe County? title little wordy shorthand 'conservative activist' douche. Consider using next time. True three states growing exponentially Carnival Cruises Galveston Texas too? Aren’t phases typically bit faster treatments opposed vaccines? not, great news great nonetheless Funny, CDC NIH ignored US Gov, admitted intentionally lying masks, wanna talk Americans ignoring experts... also experts change positions based political alignments helping credibility. will, want go lick toilet seats Walmart. virus outside sunlight, dies lot faster enclosed spaces. point. edited prior statement clarify. 3 days mainly plastic steel, include lot frequently touches surfaces, door knobs handles. even outside surfaces made materials, virus dies quickly. God right? feel like possible awake 12 hours people intelligent ? change mind, even planted seed ? Nobody says young people aren’t risk.

Young people substantially lower risk 65 older course younger people get severely sick. Note small hospital primary focuses outpatient convalescent care (post surgical stuff.)

We've speculating reasons *want* positive cases, likely would mean shut whole hospital since actually isolation ward.

Patients test positive would need transferred another hospital, means one would lose revenue. news, PA 11th week lower cases.    mean “ people die you’ll level catastrophic mismanagement “?  None true. leave dark one enforces rules theaters anyway. seems like terrible idea around Wrong topic, nothing mask poor guy, going *ages* now. really hope pulls end. War criminal keeps job hero sacrifices, gets fired? Seems right 2020 America. worthless prejudiced bigot also racist brainawshed regressive cult.

 would think likely asked ok indicated yes. can't know sure, it'd bit odd case. Florida COVID deaths 3106 according worldometer. three weeks now? Oh I'm entirely capable, Karen.

I'm choosing to.

You, hand, utterly impotent incapable backing opinion actual evidence, utterly fail next two weeks.

I imagine even spine make meager attempt.

By way, actual research methods ask question, conduct literary search see question valid, form opinion. 

But Karens like skip first steps. Tell Americas Africa. want ignore history? hopes don’t exacerbate terrible disease false premise freedoms. Wearing mask doesn’t take away freedom, saves gives freedom people around continue normal lives. everyone wore mask covid took hold country cases would dropped 80%. put mask. 

Stop scumbag. It’s hard. yeah im still gonna go movie theater right now. long time. Weak people hold people higher standard hold themselves.

Strong people hold higher standard hold others. married person different race erase racism. Maybe *because* racism.


Canada prejudiced country. test kit coming uses saliva need lab. portable. submit sample morning get results lunch. Imagine something like used.

Here link interview portable test kit Glad see American airlines backbone cave! That's exactly backpedaled fast. even need understand science - way cases increasing still under-reacting.  went UT, 13 football players test positive week. Football ain't happenin, sooner realize that, better. showed New York exhaust virus. blame started throwing 'success' back everyone else's face.

I mean got people killed basically anywhere planet 'victory'? statewide numbers, thinking NYC. *not* hit like city responded . Source:WNY He's troll cmon .....and everyone clapped. everything BRATHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL! course, they? Really? Didn’t put Covid patients back nursing homes? would bet hits 10k official cases least one day reported worldometer point August 1. Right, left part must pre-register schedule appointment. schedule appointment meet testing criteria.

Here Facebook page Director medicine Lower Keys Hospital explaining testing limits county.

[Dr duh!! bet health ministry make 997,000 something like officially confirm one reason hospitals patients allowing non-covid patients. people going ERs non-covid reasons. Yes. Testing capacity highly localized. area (NJ) adequate capacity anyone get tested without taking test away someone higher risk. even pure greed thing either, schools fail close year, especially smaller colleges.


That's excuse rushing back, big storms coming way fall. say someone overall fairly optimistic outbreak outlook Well data came out, right choice. like people said Trump going start war Iran, never happened. either side knowingly wrong? course not, I'm happy see many people taking victory lap something proud Trump trust word entirety US? Including own? Stop bigot. know nothing Hungary. Axis Stupid. CDC's number utter BS. rate surpassed multiple places (like Lombardy NY) even every man, woman, child places caught virus, obviously case. Mods might want sticky “Florida hits record high doesn’t close won’t wear masks” post. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Funny. mob mentality see time people dumb think wearing mask everyone's protection freedom. God damned morons science deniers dangerous fools. Go get virus please. Haha yeah, attitude people protested ""deserved"" get sick, fact they're getting sick feed narrative.

But people protested wearing masks whenever they're outside general, protests, protests first time they'd left house months. Add outdoor venues, makes sense transmissions directly attributable protests would fairly low. would support every airline banning solidarity American Airlines.


Let sacrificial lamb everyone learns from. didnt hear? USA defeated virus anyone says otherwise subject arrest stated plan reduce global population use vaccines? plan? reduce global population nefarious intent know about?

Also, know lot people work feel like damage economy Covid measures inflated. hospitality industry certainly taking huge hit, industries quite well still I'm seeing. Trade markets quite well. America implements everything poorly, often bad plan, fights every step way. Fall Rome much slower seems.  good point seems really hit miss mask wearing. area state seriously feel like seeing 90%+ mask wearing stores. hearing others well. 

Pretty much holding pattern another couple weeks point see things go.  environment asking questions following orders even means fellow soldiers die... expected. failure, also feature system. Even fine them, government officials could come TV remind everyone middle pandemic tightly packed together single area would defeat purpose months social distancing. could authorize police arrest ticket breaking social distancing rules. could denounce demonstrations bad public health safety.

Also, past months also banned outdoor gatherings kind. outdoor proms held, weather permitting, spreading virus low risk outdoors? seems funny suddenly, spreading virus low risk outdoors. parent child special needs, absolutely would like know risks him. help inform decisions go back school activities.

Also, disabilities result notable differences e.g. immune system function. help give insight virus immune mechanisms. work industry. company temperature checked enter sterile area airport. can’t believe passengers aren’t getting temperature checked. takes extra two seconds. didn't. leaders did.  


"" - Although mouthguards dense stop viruses, useful outside health care, says Anders Tegnell Public Health Authority. "" 


They severly downplayed importance safety. country whole world stupidity next level Man, southern states care Nope, still proves social distancing matter. Hope okay! well wishes you. Remember LGBTQ co-opted symbol Source? tested positive last days meet medical risk factors, live household multiple family members/ roommates tested positive, and/ age 50, and/ minority group please ensure getting things order thinking happen get sick. 

This meant alarmist realistic I've experienced ICU. lot parents roommates getting sick someone it, know, spread house close proximity others. People lot risk factors make ICU. unfortunately lot major minority populations filling rooms Asia, Africa, south America. 

Seriously stories similar often report even need go events leading up. 

Has cough fever days ago, get tested positive COVID, get sent home, come back hospital call EMS due increasing shortness breath, admit hospital, spend day step floor high flow oxygen, unable maintain O2 sats next morning, admitted ICU within 6 hours intubated. five thirty days ICU make there, do. 

At hospital got admitted ICU intubated 50/50 chance making side state. places closer 30% chance surviving intubated. 

There multiple stories people frantically making phone calls get affairs order thier kids loved ones making disease without intubated. Families stuck tough decisions reach multiple weeks little improvement thier family member. 

Seriously guys tested positive categories could days away intubated, sedated, paralyzed please take time prepare case hope come that. blue cheese side? last thing need virus spread internationally again. people respect :/ did, long posted me.

The first opinion piece psychiatry resident talking dual responsibilities keeping people safe COVID dangers covering face black man.

No proof black people caring COVID.

The second article result systemic racism, black people likely get COVID.

No proof black people caring COVID.

You fucking suck this.  Positivity rate also gone quite bit states (despite constant even increased testing). worrying. Wish theyd close airports 2 weeks 


If everyone forced stay home two weeks, actually it. would either know sick then, quarantine themselves, avoid spread...but nooo, people refuse calibrate time start lockdown.

I want ended too, going unmasked opposite do, hate current state pandemic. They're big whistleblowers. They'd rather burn dirty laundry back. dishonest all, pretty close comparison. What's quite clear countries region moderate lock downs early done better terms growth projections, unemployment, consumer confidence, indicators. Sweden using strategy outside international, European Nordic consensus hurting econoically well hurting people. also neglect fact around 20% Danish economy based shipping, rough ride. frankly expecting DK much worse has. 

But read sources. sound stupid 5,000 / 10 million = 0.05% population. Thank Todays COVID press conference screenshot chart I’m sure post pics like reddit. know. They're calling back cast members speak. seem second guessing reopening plan. full steam ahead. looking forward fall. violated chain command rules Reading voice like terminator movie best thing could done today Stepping individual situation,why see seems like numerous accounts poeple acting fool planes airports? I've even seen people go wacko check in. know stressful even people even bothering? like people like say stay home afraid, didnt he? Pretty sure knew gonna cause shit storm death last thing get states largely attributed increases cases increases testing, public health experts note **percentage tests coming back positive also increasing, sign growing also increasing** Arizona Texas, another sign outbreak. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

XX % test positive **(increase)**

then

XX % end hospital **(increase)**

then

XX % die ***spending time*** ventilator. **(...)** much sub political lol SARS MERS much less widespread though. would shocking anything widespread truly 0 reinfections, close(ish) relatives show reinfection. Fuck worded comment totally wrong made edit.

Your face mask protects small amount people also wearing meant. Shields stop particles better used mask everyone around wear mask. EVERYONE NEEDS MASKS. 

I'm sorry original comment trash. edited wrote slightly tried keep similar attack valid since sounded like saying fuck masks. Hopefully edit clarifies things. Just. Wear. The. God. Damn. Mask. You. Fucks. herd propaganda then? Weasel words kind. It’s misleading. Many media reports written get attention point basically fear mongering. influences people fearful probably overreact. 

Then cult deniers behave don’t care world. 

Both dangerous, I’m saying equally so, deniers certainly dangerous near term. hyping danger like crying wolf. erodes trust media experts aren’t careful message. 

Eventually pandemic hit that’s much dangerous covid 19 half population won’t believe warnings global catastrophe. Airport's/TSA masters security theater big reason someone would thought message medical organizations experts masks help, born ignorance. Possibly contributed getting information one source, part pure speculation.  Yes understand too. It’s like he’s able make wishes known. I’ll back bunker then. expected.

would count protection, even ourselves? Sorry hear grandpa, hope rest family recover quickly. shit fucking sucks we’ll get Two weeks always personal symptoms show up. idea became timeline overwhelming hospitals. Oh man. post swedish reddit unless wan't downvoted hell. People insanely defensive person picture. That’s correct, least exiting wave 1 US continues surge. New Canadian cases deaths 3 month lows. Im still skeptical data like earth miss South South East Asia strain Wuhan managed get Europe early on.

Christmas tourism interrupted, tends lot bigger south west China.  cases see 2 weeks ago. longer true. know 10 people area tested including received results within 48 hours. talking 2 weeks ago?  Yeah, we'd family country house Christmas New Year's (and trained taught weeks holidays, probably pick BJJ). relatives pretty big cities lot military coming going time (though relatives carried they'd probably dead near-death experience, exactly healthy). still think probably early coincidentally-timed miscellaneous bad respiratory bug rather actually SARS-CoV-2, enough people also start popping similar stories similar timing test positive antibodies I'll probably make effort go get tested. lying internet support Trump's 2020 campaign? Idk. didn’t pay attention that. imagine could find graphs timelines cases vs. deaths could show us that.  county WAY less testing sites couple months ago. Unfortunately violated chain command rules Ill save comment revisit 12 days. Yeah mean don’t wear masks, aren’t 6 feet apart, workers don’t wear masks either, huge groups drinking fun. really don’t care. worry virus adapting UV light. viruses susceptible UV light. UV causes breaks genome, since viruses alive cannot repair breaks virus inactivated (non-infectious).  wonder people lower paying jobs do.

Well, many cities social distancing requirements offices workplaces - best protect them. Unfortunately really boils making personal decision health money many workers. Says dude lied masks Living Arizona seeing daily spikes covid cases giving feeling second wave already coming aftermath one r/thathappened post Good. End of. I'm expert I'm sure masks restrict breathing all, maybe someone serious respiratory condition? Obviously COVID anything sort something chronic/long-term. Well businesses reopen, workers may need move parts world needed guess Honestly I'm surprised Texas, Arizona, Florida completely shut reporting numbers.

They're already skewing data making difficult public access accurate numbers. know easier deny data distorted rather killed. Covid combined flu season, good luck... don’t. OP retarded correlating old unhealthy. simple truth is.... party okay literally killing people political point. Facts science never mattered.

In fact many political positions particular party holds thoroughly debunked ineffective costly alternatives, bullheadedly stick positions politics. facts matter.

This another case that. 

It matter strong science masks, they've decided masks political issue never backtrack matter many studies show they're wrong matter many lives end. hell getting numbers from? We’ve tested less 1.5 million buddy. (I’m talking Florida.) FLORIDA testing daily. I’m talking about. you’re talking whole US, can’t speak them. Florida, state, I’ve monitoring. Yeah. bs. Military personnel pretty pissed optics/politics put ahead wellbeing peacetime. ""We respect person's right choose"".

The conservative strategy co-opting language progressives fuckin lame gross. That’s whole story. people like anti vax types may thinking it’s hoax, true. 

But part it’s several months people need move lives. “cure” coronavirus scheduled anytime soon horizon (and it’s possible may never one even). enjoy listening podcast. care much Joe himself, rather opportunity hear long-form discussion guests. weeks die. people sick month Oh, love community service idea ensure masks/gloves people *somehow cannot manage put garbage can* could disposed properly. referring definition vaccine. Vaccine word use describe putting small bit substance body stimulate body's immune response. annual flu strains. vaccines tested laboratory human studies across world - takes long time develop proper one get kind response body 1) stimulate body combat disease 2) safe stable enough used larger human population. Source? say Kindergarten Cop time favorite Schwarzenegger movie. Judge will. Thanks link. Click drop-down menu Florida see tests week reached 20k 30k/day, 12-13% positive rate. April, around 10k 20k tests/day, positive rates hovering around 5%. disease spreading, percent positive rate would stable, despite increase testing. case fatality rate COVID-19 3-4%. So, higher percentage positive cases people dying.

In Florida, all-cause mortality figures 205,461 2018, 203,353 2017, 197,236 2016. years, deaths influenza/pneumonia hover around 1.5% total (around 3k/year). 2020, all-cause mortality reached 84,687, 2679 attributed coronavirus 5469 attributed influenza/pneumonia... year half finished. spot outlier?

Look, basic, math/science-based forecasting. run numbers come something supports position, get done already. 

Below sources Florida CDC help. arrived '5469' subtracting CDC's reported Florida covid deaths combined covid + influenza/pneumonia deaths (8148 - 2679). headline irresponsible, I'm kinda hoping healthy young people getting virus ... asymptomatic get mild symptoms. would mean economy improve faster, might get decent herd immunity. 

Feel free correct know that's bad idea. Nah, screwed again. old farts flee state start believing like New Yorkers did.

Grandma new boyfriend coming visit summer kids! Here, take things article make suite narrative well. article linked, 'The potential value universal masking giving health care workers confidence absorb implement foundational infection-prevention practices described may greatest contribution.' Wow, let's help health care workers wearing mask. Good article. Stale musty. 
I didn’t loose sense taste tho, smell. [Why people believe COVID-19 conspiracy - peer reviewed paper found interesting dissects going here. 

My initial reaction “truther” idiot mild chuckle..because found mildly entertaining whole flu comparison thing still used wackos. 

That reaction morphed however pity Individual.

Conspiracy theories frequently surface times uncertainty, especially aftermath mass shootings tragic events (pandemic, civil unrest). 

Dr. John Grohol, psychologist founder Psych Central, says conspiracy theorists come ideas thin air match whatever 'fact' think true, often use paranoia-based beliefs convince others.

He says people tend uncooperative, distrustful, socially isolated — believing conspiracy theory strangers internet give sense belonging. 

Conspiracy theories make person feel special. 

This individual likely hooked diet Fox News sounds it. mean, response spot on, wanted add background info anyone wondering someone ends like special “truth” friend. stupid idiot. would impression sane person apart making think; idiot... strange. yeah !!! seem see lot faults America, great... Vote, find someone shares opinion volunteer campaign.

I know meant gently respectfully. dumbest, presumptive, condescending response.

And I've conversation enough know fault. spend lot time consuming dumb media encourage stop lecturing strangers start engaging us. way makes confused unable understand we're coming from. 

The results might surprise you.

For example - I'm 34.

I volunteered campaign every election. I've actually worked campaign budgets - two national arena. extremely politically engaged since 14 organizing first protest age 16. 

Although work hospital, spend personal time community organizers, I've done since 9 thanks family activism profoundly good political knowledge.

I sat multiple advisory boards housing first programs seen many local political wins.

I never gained political win voting. Voting least effective way achieving progress.

Voting never answer. anyone background experience would tell spent time engaging us instead talking us.

Protesters achieved gains forty years progressive voting. Even conservative states.

We need protests less voting. week SJW cultists bullied places including scientific journals like Nature etc bowing regressive  ROFL. think already do. I've seen one ""forced""into wearing mask cut hole mouth part smoke drink breathe easier. screen based ethnicity lmfao. I'm Swedish, life half doctor force Swedish, 1/3rd country Swedish. 70s

Well problem patient drugs great chance causing, least worsening, symtoms. give alcoholic SSRIs going help anything all. yes make harder get help, doctor worth salt would give show progress strive clean. Hey man - good luck, people recover don’t get bad case there’s make feel good.

Oh yeah, comment bullshit backwards. anything facemask protects wearer creates suction inhale infect others air escapes top exhale.

But sure, not, seem playing fantasy world I'll bite (not expect cogent answer you, far dodged questions):

What future constitutional rights infringed upon future answers climate change? 

Or talking ass expected challenged idiotic ideas? LOLLL really masks. masks everybody walking around wearing absolutely better nothing they're also even close good enough.

It's much distancing allowing anything crowds. That's important keep indoor stuff like bars/restaurants office buildings closed still. leaders need direct calling out. soft approach ""suggesting"" mask use presenting figures getting people. Directly calling absolute morons may actually help.  two, actually, average, long right tail. believe supernatural heatwave Hell.

Protests prove doesn't. people act like anyone ever thought didn’t infect young people? Similar number cases, Florida 3x population Arizona. obligation cater toxic people, waste time trying convince 'True Believer' thinks COVID-19 flu hoax. 

It sounds like MIL alienating OP forcing conspiracy theories open pressuring provide response, literally *thousands* well-cited news outlets sources discussing COVID daily basis. refused anything. care. want lots people die awful deaths alone ICU.  Trump recently said thinks wearing mask could seen sign disrespect towards him.

Trump actively politicizing masks. change testing testing people 35. graph make sense..Is far year? Would better wait next year proclaiming third lowest deaths? Finally, make better thousans died could saved long total deaths worse compared years? disrespect promises really matter conversation. discussing facts, feelings. Show facts masks effective slowing spread. China got hit hard, certainly little reason believe completely forthright numbers. disappearing doctors spoke COVID christ's sake. 

The fact someone agree reporting possibly botched US, trusted China, questionable.

Many transmission chains begin superspreading events, one person (usually crowded indoor space) passes virus dozens others. Early [contact studies suggest events large driver transmission around world. estimates, 10 percent people causing 80 percent new infections.  

How many indoor crowd 19,000 people.. long period time. Yup. I’m skeptical can’t remember getting sick year. So, don’t want go &amp; get tested &amp; false positive/negative. I’m going give time staying safe. think Mayo Clinic Rochester accurate test, we’ll see happens that.

Wtf We’re well past point international travel would one biggest factors prevalent virus US city. Got it. Sounds like it’s time (past time) start shutting back down. asked medical certificate physician stating can't wear mask, flight attendant refused show one it. political/partisan situation, unfortunately is. honestly think large amount lives saved one person particular would wear mask. would point far, based serological studies they’ve done, 5-10% US population infected point. There’s still lots people infected future get point there’s herd immunity thus many people would die people get infected. There’s also saying public health says successful public health intervention one looks like overreaction hindsight - lockdowns distancing clearly worked, that’s many deaths avoided certain places falling still places like Indiana Wisconsin. Nothing made reconsider living country long-term past 5-ish years pandemic response. Sadly husband would never go moving away, parents live (and country ties India, insists move to) idea raising family mixed bag idiots even wear mask properly unprecedented health crisis is...scary. virus around since early fall 2019.

Yes do. I'm sorry dense quote relevant points.

1) misquoting me. said Black people give fuck wearing masks, covid. continuously got wrong told reread said. Since like use logical fallacy arguments, look strawman fallacy.

2) First article example black people priorities. Hence, less fucks give wearing masks

3) yet another thing read thoroughly. missed part said black people care medical scientific opinions much races. 

More data distrust scientific medical expertise black adults found here. I've done work you. still going read though people reason vote people talk act like unfortunately people idiots.  It’s expected live near Tulsa OK, please safe burn fuck Trump tweeted spoke mayor curfew apply today tomorrow. conservative activist probably wanted he/she could file lawsuit American Airlines.

Truth real world: airlines regulated United States America. cannot put place policies wish, end discussion, regulation.

If science one side politically desirable narrative other, people always go latter, even cost money lives. bet 99% people ""ok, lights out, everyone watching screen, take mask one notice"". 

those know important masks even room first place worrying? Michigan much higher death rate per 1 million people Florida. likely brought Michigan Florida reverse. 

Florida  145 deaths/ 1 million population

Michigan 607 deaths/ 1 million population

Is like nickname place? evidence one steroids useful early on, blood thinners help lot.  Ask doctor clotting test.  2020 definitely getting chapter history books. Hey, forget us Oregon. Cases spiking like crazy masks required yet. 7 populous counties start require them, next week florida resident? happily write name November, seem much smarter desantis. defies rule could face $50 fine five hours community service.

""Could"" good enough. Enforcement must step. Americans showing can't behave without consequences. Entitled morons particular sad thing countries like USA Iran downward trend while, rising numbers now. Add countries gone always upward far new cases like Brazil, India Mexico. least Europe countries managing keep new cases relative low despite many restrictions anymore. Unfortunately lot people itching go movie theaters now. going resolved election. makes sense point view. also care 20,000+ black Americans died last three months. care ones die coming weeks due protests. probably kill black people disproportionately, they’re proportionally likely attend. Florida activity looking tie positives back Memorial day weekend?

116,000 100,000 deaths USA...

We’re 120,000+ deaths complete lockdown nowhere near finished. Probably bad, although still bad. Nowhere population density NYC, spread quickly. course states actually anything...

The high average age Florida going problem though. Hopefully we've learned last months optimum treatment strategies means complete disaster. Why? hope I’m wrong  going suck hard. bought protective gears parents (70+), found interesting xiaomi facemask hepa filter, disposable gloves masks, gel, protective glass, big fat freezer start stock. winter going tough. virus start much bigger base, lockdown option unless disaster comes up, going last 6 months. may seeing true disaster. documentation required knowledge. documentation ask emotional support animals. Otherwise typically ""credible verbal assurance"" 

Airlines get lot trouble denying boarding passenger disability many err side caution.

Google part 382 airlines. lot information passengers disabilities airlines cannot do. kinda looks like set ""Church said Jesus protect covid closed down: Many sick congregation."" kind thing.

Would strange Trump team catch there. Apparently cases people get virus before. knowing what's inside bet safely forgo greens ""organic spring mix"" mostly overlap deliver, outside taste, course. Yet face mask requirement. people acting like lemmings every day, notice Adjusted inflation* Though consider interesting sisters also seem overweight/obese affected strongly. Bless heart! even, China's strain Type B, genetic ancestors B strain found China US, latter higher quantities.

This like saying first pre human fossil found Asia (Java, 1891), therefore homo sapiens originated Asia UV light plus masks greatly reduces risk infection. going see people (or protest go rally), make outside . Tennessee Department Health reported 1,188 additional cases COVID-19 Tennessee, bringing state's total number cases 34,017. largest single-day increase total cases since pandemic began. travel via cruise ship. Authoritarian ideological sense means believe government able make rules apply everyone citizens generally shouldn’t question rules. 

Also, rebellious opposite authoritarian personality wise. rough man. I've anxiety issues year rough me. feel like end loved ones vaccinated. American workers strike/stop work this, anything. sewer sample study suggests magnitude infected actually tested. Whatabout whatabout WHATABOUT They've removed title now, though remains tooltip. Ditch hpill! Even implant health implications, ex mine got really bad ovarian cysts getting one. doctor vehemently denied connection, shrank significantly iud removed pain bleeding stopped. nightmare. reproductive clinic shamed removed, ran tears go another clinic get removed.

Mississippi isn’t releasing data, per county case count, technical problems. announcing today releasing numbers yesterday today. last day reported 500 cases county 50 cases day. blind residents now. Good see Reddit ageist along sexist racist. surprised though. seems imply outdoors massively safer indoors.

For now. Evolutionary pressure push virus tolerate outdoor environments passed people outdoors. expect become tolerant outdoor conditions time goes on, hopefully trade less transmissible indoors.

Remember virus came bats roost caves (indoors, sort of) close proximity. thing well adapted indoor closely packed environments. Texas testing less higher positivity rate. It’s shameful disheartening. 

I guess we’re going find bad get people take things seriously. Hey want see movie environment feel free. Going movies isn’t exactly cheap anymore, don’t plan spend large fee, try eat popcorn mask sit 2 hours mask on.

What’s point? movie would worth see? I’ll wait till hits streaming service. Yep hes troll fo sho may get thoughtful responses r/covid19 sub  Stop reading mind, dude! ;) would mean Desantis would care. simply not.  numbers higher previous day, look like spike me. kkkrying...

I would consider weight risk factor, though, consider mine be. need see evidence. mean, 20 million residence could go 200 days 10k/day. Obviously that's unlikely. But...it's impossible see full month double digits site shows Florida Texas going percentage positives, unlike California. guess lying. carriers pretty laced masks flight. Many carriers started get strict COVID policies flying loads picking up. carrier familiar literally changed policy masks 2 3 days ago strict. uniformed officer comes placard window can't ticket parking even appears able bodied might be. can't ask proof really handicapped. country world whose people goddamn stupid. surprise elected leader. Presumably documentation, anyone can't lie expose others risk? Yup. There's dramatic difference behavior (early 30's) neighbors (late 60's health conditions). Take wild guess one us conscientious disease.

It's honestly baffling they're taking seriously. One literally lung disease. They're retired healthcare workers believe science, believe COVID real dangerous. just... care. people time, go almost every day, wear masks consistently...

I trying best careful, want lung damage myself, also really care them, they're like family me, I'd never forgive brought disease could easily kill them. wear mask every time, hang outside, drop things no-contact, etc.

And just... care. city still climbing cases, care. blows mind I'm terrified them.

It's young people causing this. Inexplicably, defiance reason... people lose spreading without care world. I've heard idiots say hospitals falsifying records make money covid cases. estimate BS possibility politicians think? Vegas fun that. I'll agree e.g., random Indian casinos. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* remember Plague Inc. taught us? NFL move season New Zealand. already know. Noone truly knows say that, look dumb hell. HIPAA nothing whatsoever accomodations lol do, ones filter. Ask man that’s holding rally 19,000 people indoor arena Tulsa midst pandemic. accurate least I've seen DC. went white house \[sic\] day government gassed protestors everyone saw wearing mask. still physically distanced everyone, rather proud see compliance wearing mask, protecting looking others health well-being. true. U scientist? Trump this? Trust me, plenty idiots still willing come vacation. state cars everywhere lately. Especially tons new yorkers around... yeah, we've got lot corona eat FYI: US 1 cent coin called ""penny"", hence well known often used expression ""pennies dollar"".

You need irked more. confirm hospitals staying get overwhelmed central Texas. Huge increase last week week. family member received email floated ER/covid area person works l&amp;d. Ha, sure I'll take whatever get Sweden terms good behavior generally right ;)

Glad midsommar too! Umm 4 months recovery sars antibodies start decrease. 16 months 11% 56 people antibodies. I’ll take douchebag tried failed call reddit. Thanks though 👌 still couple weeks potentially seeing increase deaths? think it’s unlikely people Florida start taking action happens (or hospitals start getting overrun) - otherwise could dismiss numbers mainly increased testing. Well, that’ll likely change August 1. forget: Abortions due conception rape account less 1% cases.

Abstinence 100% effective probably practiced can't support another living being.

Not sure I'm flexing others ok.

Yes, I'm male. invalidate experiences?

When mother pregnant me, life threatening tumor thought twin. strongly encouraged abort obviously went it. Judging stance topic probably would prefer did, sometimes too.

Obviously severe medical cases consideration little sympathy people getting knocked irresponsible. You’ll get bored MA, look NYC.

Who would guessed Americans like goldfish. news, neighbor greener grass, mistress told wife relationship. Sure, agree masks distancing. full lock possible free country. It’s great idea constitution laws allow leader ability without massive military involvement. would far worse. 

Yes get opening country costs, costs nothing compared UI paid, business closing alarming rate. Cities close bankrupt due lack tax revenue. Medical billing costs mean nothing it’s made bullshit anyhow. long ago? Normally given kids around 18 months age. Screamd 'Perkele' loudly Sweden. Look get frustrating say stuff double down, yet never really affects probabilities. got problem take Erwin Schrödinger. Looks like took joke far Still entirely convinced come Wuhan lab.

The virus sophisticated appears tamper experimented time.

 looking updated data looks like came 4k (~3800something think) Wow! gay conservative...I'm still shocked. Actually wasn't, according health minister.

They wanted keep infection rate lower capacity, also make rules something live long time.

There second wave Sweden.

80% death rate elderly facilities around Stockholm, clearly made mistake there, overall, like strategy.

Most people looking deeper story.

Lots Swedes love alone, naturally isolate.

The Swedish public supports strategy.

If encouraged people wear masks, would even better.

I'm still sure Corona comes free. Yep, southern Sweden, right across Øresund Denmark. used part Denmark, fact, still maintains close ties Denmark. even movement return Denmark: mayor Lund, begging Danes open borders Skåne brought history up: thinking that. dad coming state. Normally routine visits get brother's go local diner breakfast.

Not sure restaurants opened yet, even are, news, they're putting plastic barriers around tables shit! wants go eat deal that?

Then mask situation, hygiene issues etc. waiter comes table gloves mask on, idea they're carrier, we're trusting handling food, nevermind underpaid, sick time cooks back?

There logic wanting go eat this. None. excerpt:

The president ... allowed possibility Americans wore facial coverings preventative measure way signal disapproval him. None things, definitely douchebag! one cent coin penny. Pennies dollar common expression Seems like Trump’s pressuring mean plan right? pandemic playbook already set thrown idiot leader? Known

See word known?

That proven.

Where test clinical diagnosis made.

There definitely 44,000,000 missed cases. switch transparent film vent ports? comment much previous two comments… Wow talk downvoting. neither conservative liberal every I’ll say something get downvoted like crazy someone later tells hey, that’s conservative thing say, can’t say here… Whatever LOL. They're also quite obviously uninformed, Burr readily admits. like anyone learning anything useful COVID episode -- maybe shut speaking ignorance. vacation accumulate year year beyond 30 days. sick leave does. vacation 30 days becomes sick leave end year. get 70% credit retirement, similarly apply retire early. 

I dozens hundred sick days. even think it.  people 200. Guess comes work sick? like millionaire cold house he's tight turn heat.

Very generous leave policy. one reasons work there. pay ok, flexibility leave policy lets life rather giving life company. I've MMR vaccine still got Covid-19, unlucky? I'm curious many others are. Captain trips intensifies reminds thing dad told growing India early 90s. Back cars seatbelts rode one asked dad use it. dad said since passenger seat needed driving holding steering wheel, could hold case accident. little believed dad point grew old enough understand correct him. wears seatbelt days even driving trust grip steering wheel. Lettuce general riskier Nobody holidays Texas sweet. Flying Spaghetti Monster even sex? Well fine let vaccinate die, paying health bill bigger issue. yet look stock price. gone since April. Makes lots sense. publication based India What? Fuck Ikr 😂 honestly understand people listen idiot. Joe Rogan seems like nothing moron medium get moronic opinions. Japan vs. US. study faith places 0.5-1%. 

Well welcome look CDC, Center Evidence Based Medicine Oxford 0.5%-1% estimate based reliable studies could definitely wrong either direction 

It wrong. stop spreading misinformation doctoring fit preferred narrative.

I'm spreading misinformation. referring peer-reviewed studies disputing claims making ""What everybody says"" Dr again, whole thing arguing saying numbers infection Arizona comparable Lombardy was.

No. actually wasnt me. somebody else.

But able see that, scrupulous data are. Yep. Take look lot beach bar photos Florida. mask sight anywhere, they’re much closer together. Plus, bar even beach, spend lot time close small number people. protest you’re constantly moving around, exposure given individual likely small. Hardly surprise there's difference transmission. want see analysis. Let us see it. thought mask situation supply much better before, no? they’re ignorant, selfish, combination two. shit. Might need relay America though. Somehow big bad government simultaneously inept all-powerful.

Whatever fits agenda, guess. Thank = ) Technically is. rights demand responsibility. Responsible people need mandated forced government follow steps reduce pandemic.

""Live Free Die"" - live free without mask die. I'm say straight speculation. Obviously done work check myself. Please lemme know thoughts.

People went go get tested obviously level concern health. Therefore likely took precautions protests. Whereas people careful protests may less likely care enough go get tested.

Again thought, anyone else think may reason? I’m baffled massive world stopping virus started bat

And afraid we’re going learn anything this, idiocy prevail. already idiots really think we're already tracked?  fool money soon parted. mUh fReEdUmBs! Sweden ZERO lockdowns it’s population 10 million 5k deaths. puts actual IFR much much lower even 0.4% take nursing homes equation. models incredibly overestimated overblown much clear now. Survival concern. want stay healthy possible long possible life.

There ton complications occur flu even cold. There's ton things catch world. alot countries states severe lockdown worse Sweden. 0 UPvoted 1 cares Can't send kids daycare work. Can't send school.

It's gonna like 1799 What's crazy airports requiring masks enter checking people's body temperatures entry airport. Thankfully, common sense face masks shields “Probably” Honest question, bad would need happen? need ambulance / coroners pulling neighbors houses? videos hospitals people dying seats hall? Disney world, old peoples, dumb (I mean stupid mud) young people tons beaches.

Yeah fucked summer. That’s *meant*. actually read Socrates scientific (ok maybe *most reading scientific* journals). 

You least nice. Stereotyping political party whole ignorant know it.

It’s like saying everyone Muslims terrorists- obviously true.  No, go hospital. I'm sure ventilators appropriate treatment Covid. Ventilators simulate lung muscles weak draw breaths. could draw breaths fine, lungs weak. Instead felt like top high mountain, blankets smothered CO2. help argument means Norway already wondering like Sweden three weeks closer Sweden's peak?

Do source Norway's prime minister, one main characters article, says ""nevermind, like Sweden""? Otherwise, that'd still current standpoint. bring money economy major argument ending lockdown lot people seem think cost opening back up. reality, lot hospital costs go directly infected could bankrupt citizens. 

Unfortunately right option true quarantine like many countries did. half-ass job really reduce infection rate much slow increase slightly. 

Now best require masks public places time (something major Florida cities starting) strict regulations cleanliness/sanitation. Vegas gaming commission making regular stops casinos check compliance. division places business like restaurants. I'm talking regularly, like daily weekly. True Yup plasma cells differentiated form B cells basically antibody factories. New headline:

FLORIDA TEXAS GOVERNORS UTTER MORONS! “Many companies hoping support BARDA developing treatments seek dampen immune system, calming “cytokine storm” wreak havoc patients severe Covid-19.

“It seems BARDA shutting door whole area medicine,” said Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg, stem cell researcher Duke University.” sure you’re getting downvoted hard. pointing it’s lives said parent comment? didn’t make comment support done actions. OC attempting insinuate China origin virus blame game Godammit can’t see frowns either 😀☹️but oh rolling eyes🙄 Betsy DeVos, course. Can't many yachts!  Covid19 killed Americans First World War. Yep commonly schools present summer courses incoming students “get feet wet” type deal (some states require grad requirement). Usually enroll courses take place beginning, end, duration summer. couple hours class day sorts time parties existing fraternities use present organization well. That’s airline want work I’m happy hear “My feeling airline succumbed mob mentality, which, feel, happening place country right now,” Mr. Straka 

Yeah, especially department justice presidency. correct infact time last month testing right now. Testing actually lower last month cases much higher. Florida live atleast. Bravo really seem much change fact positive test rate decreasing past death rate going down. testing, cases. cases automatically equal death. case deaths would surging. They're not. Yeah bit respect guy prosperity gospel bs.
I hope better now, tough time Houston. sister kids situation rescued boat. Apple poots 🤑 Well, going saw ESPN, thought said 13 positive, another ten isolation, unless misread blurb. they’re protestors left activists right. Good know. explanation. number cases decreasing. looks like holding steady we’re testing aggressively.

If able test every case, we’d see dropping steadily, we’re able test high. Attacking response? Defensive much? Try posting good news subreddit watch happens. You’ll lucky it’s deleted. guess see people aren’t coming anymore real news grassing straws keep dummies still come COVID news.  yep, form government say federal level could've implemented something like this. Show one case gunshot victim. explain CDC's *excess* deaths 140,000 higher 5 year average. Covid killed 140,000 extra people exact time frame? guy wanted attention media giving him. He’s going gain mouth-breathing supporters merch sales going go up. Can’t ignore obvious controversy/attention seekers? use incognito/private window gets last paywalls usually. get lying medical condition. want make point wearing mask stupid, oppressive, sheep mentality, whatever (according them), use pretext? voice real reasons (as dumb are) want wear mask, course, face consequences. They're different though Sign up! donate millions? virus things body keep alive outside body. Outside body food source, exposed things like UV light kill much faster. see something could survive longer cold, assumed long refrigerator, couple days maybe (or even still active enough deactivated viral load would much reduced), maybe lot longer freezer.

There's hard data I've able find choice guess. sanitize packaging goes in, eat get cooked (but salads, can't really effectively).  6m population community Valencia Spain, bit smaller Arizona. date, 12,000 positive results. Arizona 44,000 rising alarming rate. worried US start taken way longer happen expected. feel guys US. Time northeast ban visitors states. absolutely know isn't, he's magat. 5k nothing! Even triples year means IFR incredibly low get herd immunity. would simply comparable bad flu season. deaths lag new cases two weeks cases started rise week ago, tough tell week two. seem like fear mongering patient enough wait sensible lag time bot script something shows removed deleted comment time archive it. banned sub reason, sends direct message comment (again, archived) banned sub use in. Otherwise would replied comment used it. That’s approach AZ: “thoughts prayers” instead “masks distance”.  think US needs reevaluate relationship words like 'freedom' 'liberty', sometimes seems US quite toxic relationship debate seems close impossible. AA’s company policy doesn’t. Seems like good time food truck. changes accomplished tho mean. 

Electorally otherwise? fucking kidding me, right? Conservative activist = asshole paper thin justification I'm asking US spend trillions investigating.

I'm saying US' response 4 Benghazi deaths 120,000 COVID-19 deaths incompatible, odd. Yes, referring manipulating results. Glad hospital isn’t sleazy can’t understand would lie like I’ve said Protests going Portland since day. protesters safe. Trust me. Cheers too, take care stay safe. guess around us try take care other, rest control. Well darned magic virus. Spreads Churches, funerals, parks knows stay away riots protests. help *both* sides making wearing mask political. one hand media saying protest create spike wearing mask open. hand accusing wear mask endangering do. think people wear mask current situation media blatantly talking sides mouth. Well would save [~~demons~~ passengers dont know anything day day lives people live Gabon Nigeria. there's lifestyle explanations, investigated. Interesting great know. guess time like airlines hemorrhaging money, probably lot less inclined spend whatever costs improve stuff, regardless helpful is. “Houston - problem” Lol Yes, olympics. Trump could helped save many lives endorsed mask wearing. Easter magic didn’t work Arnold bought shares gnus, hope well future. reason bought going making moves :) Theyre saying tests reflect people contracted disease 2 weeks ago, people get tested feel sick, takes 5-14 days.

High flow different story isn’t something someone would ever hospital anyways. source says otherwise I’d love see it. Travel China negligible comes managing pandemi China screens people leave.

Travel US get bombed humans carrying biological agents. February, would've Italy. deaths? cases key metric don’t, isolation, cause harm? Hospitalizations deaths real metric Well, damn. coming veggies! Clearly one else read article.

On top that, test received (I think less accurate) throat swab instead nose/brain variety. testing protocol free Jacksonville testing site Lot J TIAA Stadium. experience. Yet usually see headlines younger people blaming them. Oh, good question - quick Google search; might less that. I’ll take bet I’m going need GoFundMe page cover it. bringing race scenario? necessarily, data ive seen mostly young people getting sick. mortality rate lower, solid data hospitalization rates, rates long term side effects.  So, given enough spread, could still overwhelm hospital system. know Florida done good job keeping nursing homes, widespread becomes, difficult keep away them. Dude 100% agree even state masks mandatory, they've made exceptions mental physical health, without elaboration. seems like copout people, lawsuit preventative measure state. CDC disagree statement, odd. Redditors large broke teenage men held job long enough even pay taxes. 

Saying ""tax write-off"" nice way let people know are, fact, smart. Amazing. Can't wait broadway play. also like failed defend medical condition interview Acceptance cool boy picture health. 80% Americans obese nobody talks it. RIP Lettuce one risky foods eat even pre COVID.

I’ve gotten extremely sick ate since. nothing run arguments there's always insults. Ha. saw Twitter. “black” (I use quotes prob bot white Trumpkin/ Russian) twitter person telling Black people walk away Biden DNC.
 
Like “oh yeah. there’s ever appealing time support Trump, it’s he’s ramping racism calling US army quell BLM.” true testing, test positive rates also going means larger spread virus. athlete Oh that's stupid banned here. least sends direct message happens. Based I've read worst first list is: Quebec worst, Ontario Alberta. Seven provinces three territories better Alberta. saw somewhere one daily discussions nursing home deaths added daily totals anymore. true? anyone info that? First, think might looking binary. actually think that's big problem quite people. complete foolproof solution, nothing.

Masks, multitude reasons, going 100% effective (the kind, fit, etc.). Neither social distancing, paying extra attention hand washing, touching face/eyes, etc. lessen risk. two people close together greater risk 1 mask greater masks greater masks maintaining bit social distancing. off, degrees.

Additionally, still seems bit understanding gained, would appear someone sick wearing mask near sick without mask effective way around, sick person maskless well person one. Seems logical me; airborne droplets stopped mask seems pretty clear would effective source, potential person could infected (and that's ignoring droplets hitting eyes even significant route infection). logic behind it, that's layman guess. 

But seems like people know say sick person wearing mask greater impact impact. right this, he’d still flying American. Critical thinking, welcome! want US spent trillions investigating exactly? know, going PACKED! Florida hide hospital numbers. tell em keyboard warrior Recall campaign happening governor Michigan well saved state. Maybe something like asthma. Wearing mask might trigger episode making hard breath.

But there's catch-22 masks preventing respiratory illness Secretary Health Secretary Transportation.... look testing data state (Florida) today compared time last month, testing way last month right cases 3x higher month ago. governor god damn moron. That’s never shows data back statement can’t. self defense someone whoops ass? Oh my. watched [the video main it's.... silly curve gradual since NYC density something like 27,000 per square mile. bad news nobody cares mitigating, back end curve open ended decide something people get scared enough voluntarily self lock spectrum (very high functioning) barely stand wearing mask. 

I'm spectrum &amp; 2 kids well. working mask bit easier wear- fitted style piece wire midline (over nose) holds fabric away nose &amp; mouth. far helped lot, fabric moving &amp; every breath.

Still figuring best design brother might able work something helps. people use plastic face shields instead masks, though I'm sure work well. Booooooo well that's dumb Yup gonna die. Rejoice r/shitamericanssay gold, thank much! 🥰 under. tuesday though got shot figures average pandemic?

These numbers difficult get, general percentage normally quite high. area, 80-90% pre-COVID. one reason routine surgeries canceled people end using ICU resources.  could 74% actually typical rate, brought canceling non-emergency procedures. Arnie really legend It’s logic. wearing mask protects me. wearing mask protect you. virus airborne meaning could get clothes, eyes, anywhere around face mask isn’t air tight. 

They want wear mask protect others you. 

Maybe wear mask. choose to. never felt much sympathy worry American public now. deserve tragedy. (Also Brazil, Sweden...) one nick saban mascot bama? wants people packed cities die support thinks wont affect rural base. Tulsa ground zero stupid well COVID. called 'World' health organization, usually really invasive active Europe US perfectly capable responses. least usually \*cough, CDC\*

Considering basically organization coordinating health responses mostly developing countries, think say run well, Europe US. 

But again, money makes world go around EU member states US largest $$$ WHO, set rules game countries dance tune afterwards. Coronaviruses also know long immunity periods humans. dont last year. scv19 vaccines yearly thing like flu vaccines Good job- blame people trying feed us.

What asshole Thank Arnold. hate tgis virus become pushing personal politics people stead fucking public safety us favour

Why you? 

None mentioned countries list less 300 000 inhabitants. one you. 

The second metric look at, interest you. remember asking cover face smaller change life countless people asked go war protect us live area hard hit early, vast majority people wear masks. family parts country never saw high cases area, tell see masks.

Your right, scientists actual studies instead going gut (models). Kind -- forbearance programs helping people mortgages. renters...less help. Suspending evictions bare minimum.

We're talking wearing masks, lockdowns. People fucking minds go there. People sue us that's way pay critical care.

If medicare billions medical suits, insurance claims, etc would evaporate overnight Without masks another lockdown needed. Period. Enforce masks federal law well done virus. exactly quoting here? friend owns pool construction business, says he's orders last 3 months he's last five years.

It’s insane state less 400 new cases day less 40 new deaths still needs closed. People bills pay, put food tables. curve bent, know virus before. know anyone 65 preexisting conditions fine. Even though cases spiking states new daily death still going down. every state country opened seeing increases cases.

If want stay inside, stay inside. longer stay closed, worse economic impact is, economic depression would far worse virus does. rights don’t end fears begin. Lol real no-one talks it, ran poll common (check post history curious). testes immune privileged site concerning phenomenon. evidence people sitting near air return vent, correct recirculating air  pants nah point people publicity get followers. ...and that’s know you’re dealing someone 1. whose beliefs much matter identity / culture good faith argument literally impossible 2. wrong.

I’m split remote learning. It’s probably fine 12 years below? Even don’t understand immunity exposure SARS-CoV-2 works, right? without understanding could officials justify pursuing herd immunity strategy?   end day somebody pay it. There's economic consequences bailing people postponing loans/mortgages. neither us probably anybody else subreddit qualified speak intelligently. It’s almost like getting talking points White House.

How many still left ahead Sweden? People getting infected they're outdoors wearing mask makes perfect sense. Hey, we're two assholes internet. Mathematically equal probabilities right.

Except you, convenient. could let thread die situation change way all. There""s perfect, simple, shutdown lie offer. think puts tiny bias coin flip.

So yes, think talking ass. possible not? Sure. come on, know ;) case context person Health sector, reason say “he political person”. important remember Ohio among worst rates testing US. Pneumonia cases double annual average. sure worse reported. anti-science bias biased public health officials inconsistent driven ideology like Fauci.

In NEJM paper published March 26, Fauci said following: “This suggests overall clinical consequences COVID-19 may ultimately akin severe seasonal influenza (which case fatality rate approximately 0.1%) ..."" March 11, however, Fauci testified front Congress, saying coronavirus “is 10 times lethal seasonal flu...""

He factor 10.  right wing publicity stunt, incarcerate days. China ignited war?

And posted one “article”, actual peer reviewed STUDY based FACTS SCIENCE. things clearly grasp. opinion, proven scientific method. 


Also, don’t know “final IFR”, almost certainly 0.2-0.3%. study faith places 0.5-1%. However, like said, “final IFR” known point time. past week seen studies (pre-print, peer reviewed taken seriously) everything 0.2% 2.6%. lot seriously questionable methodology, say study faith seemed place 0.5-1%. could definitely wrong either direction though something determined kind certainty point time. 


Please stop spreading misinformation doctoring fit preferred narrative. might make feel comfy cozy inside (and hey, want believe it, go ahead makes feel better) real potential put others risk. 



And again, whole thing arguing saying numbers infection Arizona comparable Lombardy was. Literally nothing you’ve even tried claim anything that. You’re straight denying science point, unless something offer opinion, done conversation. 


Good luck. [That wasn’t Deaths still flat - possibly even slightly downward. It’s least 2 weeks since Florida’s case count started increasing - shouldn’t seeing increased deaths too? Right? people talk over-prescribing antibiotics, thought meant prescribing minor infections body could likely fight itself. realize places handing like candy. Texas here, suddenly last weeks wife ones wearing masks public. everyone looks us *like we're crazy ones*. absolutely maddening. know this? keep sewage lab somewhere? reading this, getting stressed. Reddit showing idea tax write offs work Dates people. Dates important.  


 “Doing wrong” seems like understatement. seems like actual sabotage. mask thing terrible. Trump actually said thinks people wear masks political statement him. It’s like wants supporters die pandemic get worse. because, unlike Orbán Bolsonaro, Trump can't manipulate US numbers without consequences. living 70% infection vaccine. go 19 positive sub. People different illnesses. going 100 days. I'm wondering impacts prognosis vaccine. ""dae doomers thread?"" folks realize everything happy smiles hopeful wishes? Look state things. preventable, us realize deemed ""doomers"" now. sick end Feb/beginning March, negative strep negative flu. time, people getting tested people came form China people knew persons positive, consider testing me, condecending mentioned COVID 19, know not? kind respiratory virus, blood pressure high put Lisinopril. week LIsinopril, anxiety attack something- tight chest, fast heart beat. next week put higher dose Lisnopril. 😂 “Its kensperacy” Large events=250 up. events 5k up. Well used be. 

I think paid sick time really cool idea. something ever get really cool. think employers that. don’t think government should. {political party shall. named} ...I know devil don’t thing government everything 

I don’t disagree watching rates, watch hospitalizations could late. test 10k per day would expect least hundred positives. normal point. new number 50% positive that’s alarming. Yes, simple look supports could 5%

We two things argue here. 

My data supports 70-90% infected population get heard immunity. went lower value.
My calculation death rate based using data reasoning.

So first, agree New York, knew test positive die COVID-19 reasonable assumption work with?

Can also agree largest amount deaths coming symptomatic? is, likelihood dying without symptoms ever appearing low.

If agree that, move forward.

The IFR - infection fatality rate - based estimated actual recovered plus estimated actual deaths - cases. divided number deaths number cases. agree calculation?

We know actual number recovered. know over. know - need agree - infected either recover die.

In New York, May 1, 166,883 confirmed cases. use is, death rate trails infection rate 14 days, death rate higher going calculate here.

On May 1 166,883 confirmed cases, pool cases 13,156 confirmed deaths noted.

We good number right now. agree unlikely deaths anyone symptomatic state know about. possible, likely sick enough die went hospital became part pool.

We need agree well unlikely sick people tested. probably were, again, pool people symptomatic.

So said ""assuming 50% would symptomatic"" talking pool deaths would come from, population whole.

Using New York numbers, total pool 166,883 confirmed cases May 1 13,156 confirmed deaths.\

So confirmed case May 1, 8% probability death.

13,156 / 166883 = 8%

Because difference calculating death rate based data, took middle approach 5% based data [Diamond calculates death rate symptomatic people 2% (9/381) symptomatic/asymptomatic rate 50%.

So correct, could see many 175,000 dead swedes get heard immunity.

Until data shows different number sick dead and/or different calculation needed heard immunity universally agreed on, calculation stands. see real tragedy sunshine state, say we've already lost 3K human beings. number could grow really fast. P U B L C U N submission removed because

His initial claim NY Times reporter also plane recording Alabama like 100 less yesterday. I'm sure once-a-day updates. one person's opinion, whole country's opinion.

Sincerely, European. good. overly serious times nice smile something innocent tbh :) upside grab to. bad. Hospitlizations up, ER's near beginning send notices nearing capacity, warning general public. nurse know warned using PPE warned complain publicly.  commentary: study written John Ioannidis who, according wikipedia, ""is Professor Medicine, Health Research Policy Biomedical Data Science, Stanford University School Medicine Professor, courtesy, Statistics Stanford University School Humanities Sciences."" 

Part job literally study science research - meta science. WELL respected job... critical COVID-19 response. info back claims... people want hear it. True, afraid going today. Unless invested heavily stock market...  worse infection cortisol you’re producing attempt combat it. Correlation doesn’t equal causation. Another raise care patients also takes burden hospitals people going die anyway.

-Ron DeSantis objections anything actually said npc? telling protesters aren’t spreading virus? Wearing masks Fuck it. I'll take rushed vaccine point body temps good way check tbh. internal fever show outside temp stats nursing homes only. BS testing levels can't BS bodies beds morgues.

They refocusing issue think deaths. Abbot says Texas plenty beds, that's primary argument. preventing deaths, preventing illnesses, enough **in case sudden expected surge infections.** dying metric matters? virus makes people, even recover, sick may we'll long term impacts many recover. Overall spread highly relevant, view.  Lol. canned response incapable making rational argument. Hopefully troll. right. gov't right demand wear clothing public, keep body yourself, many things. private entities stores. subject laws soon step foot public.

These rules fuck right individual nude. Though, may puritan holdover cover parts body, many states women legally allowed topless, harmful public health. main reason can't naked store public transport, take shit sidewalk spread disease. good public health, government steps protect people, main purpose. 

Enforcing mask wearing literally vein. Protecting public preventing, much possible, spread lethal disease. 

Your argument essentially similar saying 

""Underwear uncomfortable, allowed rub junk bus seat shit driveway. I'm healthy, worried, going listen scientists media germ theory, give fuck you."" stress, better fellow Americans. center “pocket”, two hands go in. one zipper. news this? bet helped enough get cocky, quite enough declared victory. heavy overlap conspiracy/anti-government right wing.

There's heavy overlap conspiracy/anti-government left wing, well; sites like Mind Unleashed prey well-meaning liberals every day.

They lure people innocuous articles, take long chemtrail stuff creep surface. he’s worried stock market investments... many IRL people dumb. see brain drain tries tell two genders.  No, rural Texas. morning, local dentist &amp; wife confirmed covid 19 &amp; 300 people contacted exposed. county 12 confirmed cases, surrounding areas many more. Sweden Quebec hardly comparable terms factors culture demographics among others. Sweden's high trust culture give huge advantage. 

Also Quebec locked late. Efficacy NPIs heavily timing dependent. compare Sweden neighbors, early moderate lockdowns, failure becomes sparkling clear. Esp. compared Norway done fantastically. You’re referring gdp data couple months ago? Look current projections anywhere. GDP projected net loss countries shut down. Since they’re like $3.50 apiece, might take couple ‘em make waterskis pet Kraken. Interestingly, thought opposite would happen: would opened states worked subvert testing variety means, go, look! cases.

This method far insidious, though, makes look like there's sort scientific conspiracy. Good practicing rights. least he’s rioting stealing Damn..wish knew reopened schools 1 school closed due outbreak :/ made divide choosing bully. cant possibly claim dont listen science. think Trump speaks truth delusional. it’s unbelievable wearing mask become political. we’re going hell hand basket keeps *smize* Bonnaroo gives dope bandana different facial hair smile options every year. I've preparing years. One without unemployment assistance another stimulus package? fun that. first thing exchange air house outside air. Open windows doors sit outside while. Surfaces wait; less likely mode transmission breathing droplets left hanging air inside house. back moon great distinction.

You're right. deaths considered less impactful; lives less valuable they've written expendable. remember news? think think do, POS would booed everywhere goes. studies. average age death Covid-19 78-81. Average lifespan overall US 79, ten years sounds high. see math early on, flaws like assuming average age death would 72 later found true. also assumed people dying would estimated remaining lifespans others cohort turned true either. protestors wearing masks! hasn’t helped American president said wearing mask way signaling distaste him. Texas 4,100 yesterday though. Yeah point there's arbitrary line 18 suggested directly contradict Encourage medical professionals write letters.

Honestly hospitalist bedside nurses need walk out. whole thing would fixed hour doctors nurses made clear refuse martyrs reckless reopenings. NY. one worst epicenters. we're pretty good. Wear mask. simple! Daily death numbers continue decline. Yesterday 8th Thursday row show reduced numbers.

Going back last 8 Thursdays: 2201, 2129, 1715, 1418, 1223, 1031, 904, 747

This really good sign everything we’ve working making difference. rate may close zero daily deaths early August 1st.

We’ve reopened month longer places, I’m starting get optimistic despite spike cases we’re seeing spike deaths.

Gotta keep watching numbers. saying business mind you, incase anyone following along. thing though nothing stopping someone telling service animal. 

In case though medical condition able prove it, though. responsible human also contributing factor. many people wear mask practice social distancing - choice. I'd think casinos fat better ventilation system. consider victimless crime something illegal, well half. I'm mask breaks? ear loops snapped putting mine heading store drive home. SOL happens? Tomorrow: Brandon Straka named acting Secretary Defense can’t make safe don’t want thanks like freedom breathing. Scared world? Don’t come outside. asked they’re reacting like I’m telling you. They’re thinking rationally. didn’t excuse behavior, explained it. Thanks downvotes « I travel lot never wore mask, never come up »

Have heard coronavirus, dumbass ? really wonder people think virus fake, vaccines don’t work, masks useless... live California wearing mask sence February still continue even thou open America . think people buying won’t using them? Anti-science alt-right activist would appropriate.

feels like conservatism still means anything vaguely aligned GOP even though they've changed stance many core conservative issues. opinion watch new cases % positive. Hospitalizations incredibly important metric, lags behind two. worry wait see hospitalizations spiking, it'll control. 
 business live events. large gatherings. Anywhere. 
 
I'd defer this, I'm also pretty restrictive mean say large gatherings- 16 people getting sick eating restaurant. That's sort thing _should not_ happening. right 16 cases need happen. 
 money help economy restart stop virus spreading. try push agenda though “pandemic”. 
 
You think something like paid sick leave prevent people showing work sick? think $1200 payment monthly next ~6 months people would feel less worried paying bills? think going simply disagree this. think would make huge difference. Okay, okay everybody. fucking relax. 


Or die. pressure. Yep, living reading local news reaffirms selfishness folks. really dumb trolling?  found pretty great one Creative Commons: Indeed. business closed? rent paused. allowed open 50% capacity? rent 50% usual. Done.

I think nobody wants public realize banks businesses like anything else, subject things like accountability oversight.  everyone wore masks properly socially distanced, feel like could still help economy get back sooner. Considering lot people handling situation right now, seems nearly impossible. Especially since lot governors handling seriously either... free access get reddit search engines? fault business model sucks ass Gotcha, nothing wrong that.

If anyone actually wants see though, guy math Texas (it's right Orange County) demonstrates full shit governor is. Another treatment doctor toolbox good things afraid Texas, Arizona, Alabama South Carolina numbers going be. still little. Maybe MMR helps, whatever reason help everyone... want same! TELL IM RIGHT 🥵 really. conservative doesn’t wear mask, everybody sub loses minds. Thousands people across country break social distancing weeks end, crickets. bias astounding double standard almost unbearable. People care politics virus. doesn’t go guests. He’ll go voice moment revert, especially another guest talks hoax blaming states all. I’m stating state people respecting orders. Everyone mandated wear mask everywhere go, aren’t going restaurant? Absolutely ridiculous. Obviously aren’t required wear sitting down. People don’t care people. NY, 618 positives 68,541 tests yesterday. DeSantis full shit.   Deaths coming.

Hospitals starting fill too, FL starting cases time pulled stops.

My current rentals FL certainly lose significant value, maybe I’ll able pick water front property cheap. I'd rather copy sane countries like South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Germany, thanks.

A draconian dictatorship standard handle pandemic. Nah they're gonna let virus thing. arguments there!! much thing declining late spring summer. New Zealand stay home 4 years? 

Or implement rigorous system testing, contact tracing, quarantining travelers? 

Stop acting like inevitable. wasn't. way take years. We're selfish disorganized learn others situation control. 

I'm going give cautious people got bored social distancing tired wearing mask. Yes, suggesting even numbers hit threshold, might never know. Pneumonia deaths wayyyyy florida covid deaths stable.  that's new conspiracy, stems half truths like conspiracies ignoring counterfactual evidence Bob Ross Rick Ross  mostly stupid American thing entire species stupid?

""When went show report card would say county, among things, asked delete report card showed counties, pretty much, ready reopening,"" says. ""And want draw attention that.""

Jones says superior asked open data alter numbers state's coronavirus positivity rating would change 18% 10% — state would appear meet target reopen.

""To me, read like kind political conspiracy higher directive,"" Jones says. ""It seemed like people expected brought results, results support plan written, not, seemed panicked, like figure way make results match plan.""

────────

She says state's dashboard, person tests positive counted positive test once, matter many times test positive. person tests negative counted time test negative coronavirus. Jones says many residents, health care workers, require repeated testing, state's dashboard artificially deflating true positivity rate. ""They're adding total test figures instead total people, makes percent positive extremely low,"" holding signs saying need haircuts. I’m 24 2 dose infant- wouldn’t need booster would I? Keep licking boot. Lynchs Pub incident? one hand, based week's worth outbreaks (defined 2+ cases setting), may generalize. hand, UK schools open two weeks...

If they're able isolate things quickly total number cases stay low, number outbreaks seems worth benefit kids back school. says 24 school outbreaks, 24 hospital outbreaks, 50 ""other"" (I'm curious ""other"" means). far schools hospitals, 24 outbreaks *all* schools seems less scary. That's understand. they're far expensive. people supposed know economies work? hotels full state plates snowbirds vacation. really difficult.

But explains many people die lack health care housing. Depends live. blame people. Japan good despite somewhat crummy government response. Meanwhile USA people protesting things reopen people refuse wear masks know like making dumb jokes wearing mask weaponizes individual. NYC largely relaxing precautions read VA don’t blame states relaxed early. mean 0.014%. Per day. exponential trajectory now, number continue increasing every day unless make change. remember average 0.3% hospital beds per capita. That's even ICU specialized ones coronavirus. people gasp last breaths -- crammed hospital hallways? And? person complaint problems, someone trying help them, return dick  still getting richer taxed something

What? That's crazy talk lol. viral load linked severity -- studies indicated -- may make sense take moderate lockdown approach people remain home much possible wear masks, take extreme measures like wiping groceries constantly using hand sanitizer. way, got ""dose"" grocery delivery, likely mild allow develop antibodies get sneezed idiot wearing mask Kroger's. makes sense... US really ran idiots. completely baffling people believe, vote people like this. even book smarts we're talking plain common sense. That's done New Yorkers going State beginning sadly everyone always crying ""but right..."" including libs. “I travel time,” said. “I’ve never worn mask. It’s never come up.

Lol it’s funny people want deny even tho viruses come animals insects. one...nah, can’t that.

It’s okay. think people get kick acting like know better - let’s give weeks media catches like last time. German here. hide, almost fully opened restrictions large gethering fields. opened parts things like required mandatory mask. life pretty unrestricted aside that. point dedicated enough time early get total number currently infected manageable level. try test much like know almost cases.

This lockdowns phase. already lot us states failed. enough testing many cases opening up.

AFTER reopening right circumstances important broad masses society compliant measures like mask watering mandatory leaving contact information restaurants barber places visited contact tracing purposes. US files many cases.

The general public compliance seems waaaaay low many places. also deaths tragic, general desaterous levels. Thank you. still embarassing could easily avoided. mean, could easily prove wrong.

Measure positivity rate increase rate testing compare changes day day. positivity rate outpaces change rate testing, virus spreading rapidly testing account for. Fucking democrazies. NY reopening plan pretty solid government willing pull back earlier phase needed. see second wave happening universities reopen fall bring COVID back huge numbers. Never said US good job fact said exact opposite many many many comments last several months, please try keep went doctor week routine check-up. walked wearing mask, receptionist smirked &amp; said, ""Um, that."" one person there, doctors, nurses, patients, wearing mask. also social distancing enforced. absolutely floored. point is, medical professionals &amp; authority figures refusing wear masks, makes much harder convince general public needful. Careful that, talk doctor first vitamin supplements might counter indicated along meds. Better check. entirety eastern Europe like - almost deaths comparison.

I mean, want lock country legislative means so, fine, choice. complete lockdown Germany either, people still went work. 

But things country do. ramped testing/tracing isolated people break infection chains. People usually labs basements test , resources contact trace power quarantine infected persons. responsibility government.

Also Tegnell's statement masks stupid: ""If sick stay home."" asymptomatic spread exist. Even mounting scientific evidence, data whole countries backing fact masks work, change stance masks.

At point, seems doubling everything said thinks can't change opinion. American Airlines probably policy bringing refuse garbage board presence behavior violated said policy. flew recently take mask thing pretty seriously. 99% passengers. know reasonable accommodation would someone can't wear mask medical reasons. doubt that's guy know accommodation could make letting wear one.

When confirmed? thought last talk speculation bat pangolin transfer. confirmed, guess possibility.

If strain actually ""confirmed"" coming bat show source, I'd interested reading it. SK NZ strategies best.  investigate every conceivable lifestyle difference them? Even though worlds leading meat exporters #1 #2 afflicted countries, export map pretty much aligns exactly hot spot map?

I chose look Gabon it’s would consider isolated variable. didn’t know tsetse fly going 

Low population density, much travel traffic - 2 variables less controlled for. afflicted? common heavily afflicted countries? makes different nations area aren’t impacted? like data analyst crack 

If look population density map compared covid test positive map, it’s almost inverse correlation, suggests social closeness probably isnt main mode spread. (So much social distancing.) want say think community transmission infected, early symptomatic people, majority infections, believed asymptomatic transmission, coming this. 

It’s beef. think outbreak happened us Brazil meat supply due industrialization production, spread like wildfire (blood, feces everywhere processing plants). It’s line know many viruses. 

Now speculation, I’m going throw there: think Trump knows. Meatpacking facilities stopped reporting case outbreaks - we’re finding workers go doctors. That’s doesn’t wear masks. That’s he’s allowing record meat exports abroad (while citing shortages American people) loudly blaming China. cases go worldwide, especially China, it’ll harder pinpoint cause origins. recently went record saying “testing overrated.” Probably test positive rate cause raised eyebrows. [Collateral Speaking eating healthy though, there's hardly vitamins lettuce anyway. Maybe easier-to-prepare veggie vitamins like taste would better option. comparing Japan America? Japan insane population density. But, guess what, wore masks even COVID-19. extremely well right now. explain away? still reasonable. Wearing mask simple save lives. Deciding customer seeing smile infintely less important saving employee's life. 

Most passengers interact 1 2 people flight, attendants exposed hundreds people much higher risk contracting spreading Covid. 

This debate. Wearing masks saves lives, valuing customer service life inhumane. 

""But least Karen 1st class saw smile...and she'll repeat cust-"" said flight attendant final words family three including two small kids orphans. read somewhere air conditioner filter actually one best materials homemade masks, ability filter particles smaller materials (below medical-grade masks), filters may good choice. Good. Humiliate trumpets. Go clap flap Right? Like what's stopping happening again.. Ohhhhh.

O_o apparently wearing mask political stance sadly both...  people. I'm hard core \[\[HARD CORE\]\] supporter POTUS believes God US Constitution keep us free country - pro-mask. whole social distancing thing, put mask someone comes close me, whether mask not. usually, wear KN95 FFP2 mask that. work (essential worker) even around friends family. Thousands people still dying still magic bullet form treatment/serum/vaccine. yep, masks me. Without looking post know probably entitled white dude  Except stupid assembly trying undo work done. said BLM protestor probably would let burn whole plane ground Seems specific localized lockdowns virus begins getting hand would bad thing, reopen things get better? frowned upon? Im worried precedent may setting. Maybe unnecessary. I'm unconvinced 1) receiving accurate useful data government COVID situation 2) situation bad warrants heavy-handed response government, meant serve people, force certain things house. 

China exercising authority, yet got hit hard like certain (but all) parts US. personally know certain masks actually effective slowing spread thing. 120K/2.2M 5.5%. Best case scenario mortality rate 0.4%, likely closer 0.8%. Survivors often multiple health complications.

Yes taken approach start agree you. think telling 300 million people tomorrow go stricter lockdown two months would end up? think protests bad....

What option? ask you, please tell me. It’s really not. It’s becoming clear overwhelming majority transmission occurs three conditions met:

1. within six feet infected person least minutes.

2. absence masks

3. indoors

We surprised Japan hit hard (failed condition #2) cases linked beach parties Florida March (failed condition #3). Protests aren’t spreading virus easily fail conditions #2 #3. It’s people regularly gathering close together offices, restaurants, shopping malls, friends’ homes, choir practices, etc. without masks (meeting conditions) virus spreads easily. They’re combined phase 2/3 Imperial College vaccine. Sinovac vaccine ahead far right conservative nations. Hopefully ship would deny well!! Maybe small sailboat—just him. co-worker Florida returning Michigan next week. wish manager would require quarantined. really ticks family could bringing rona back Michigan.

The people thought virus ""magically disappeared"" either extremely ignorant able focus two issues once.  


All really saying disappeared YOU, attention span Trump. disappear anyone paying attention ;) prevent it, possibly helps immune system deal major forms illness. Wtf? disney magic! (opening july 11) Thanks Maria Shriver family's legacy...but I'm sure know that. sense says able both! must destroy economy? written way save people bankruptcy?

It's way around. There's way save economy. nothing people still alter habits leading crash demand likely depression.

This pandemic. good option. mitigation. laws saying US. Sure. BS article assumption supposition. Fins take great pride anti social SDing naturally. What’s point here? modelling saved thousands lives, vaccine I’ve changed it. article incredibly sad. surge started. Probably result Memorial Day weekend super spreader event. 

You probably see around 400 deaths day end month/early July. Well said. Activism commitment cause stunt. However appreciate “journalism” observers. laid bare many ugly truths need seen. medical condition terminal fuckwit. would think Arnold would home gym.  Can't testing many. [our walk testing centers test 200 people Reading title reminded Ikea furniture. actually true. guy championing Scandinavian policies almost major party's nominee.

(And yes obviously super special system happen, ultimately person win. I'm argue system be... Scandinavian policies in-fact extremely popular among significantly chunk actual voters, although certainly unpopular amongst lobbyists, corporations, megadonors, corporate news companies.)

Oh yeah, I'm talking Italy/Europe general.

It would go LONG way making neighbors feel better situation they, like said, issue sincere 'mea culpa, right, wrong, we're sorry actions harmed population relationship all' actually hard work finally bringing outbreak control. Honestly, would gain back lot respect I've lost. 

Well, unfortunately unlikely. least pivoting. hope pivot comes quickly, sake region. catch Covid also? mistake (and everyone else's too) locking imposing strict protocols nursing/elderly homes, making N95 masks mandatory healthcare professionals (surgical masks cut breathing Covid soup). 

As high infection, agree, that's achieve herd immunity, best time spring/summer there's sun, lots outdoor time, flu season. Countries remain strict lockdown now, going bad time colder months.

The reason could handle well locking wearing masks continued months. take us getting walloped make us wear masks, implying; competent leadership laying comprehensive plan get this. Could elaborate CANNOT part.

Since way actually save lives reduce infections.

Thanks. Italy free country full lock down. majority countries free. Americans refuse sacrifice guise freedom rights. government asked stay home entire time (minus food shopping obviously), would complied. avoid takeout Amazon deliveries hiking months. think paranoia government trying take people's rights different, bigger problem country need handled eventually.

Lots costs made bullshit. every small business struggling shut down, there's landlord bank refusing stop billing. Somewhere chain man need money refusing give break do. Yeah, come contact least 5 employees experience. It’s wonder outbreaks. PA we’ve 42 consecutive days downward trajectory, one three states type success. It’s possible fight corona, can’t stupid it. shut early March mask wearing enforced  Oh office job. work home, although allowed Corona. think I've since March. 

I really love office, good people understand management make good life.

Speaking health, actually December February run severe colds. People multiple weeks often sick month. One guy went doctor 7 times. cannot convince dudes give blood get free antibody test though. remember telling guy sits closest me, dry coughs rarely contagious, probably contagious anymore. I'm office germaphobe, came days relapsed. 

Most guys older extra risk factors, immunity lasts while, hope Corona protected fall. Oh US fucked beyond repair. Slack jawed fanatics hysterical bedlamites peddled rival corporate interests drowning sane voice public sphere. Could there's pandemic maybe? People care. collective people.

Some folks care. Arnold literally best, man. Thank kind stranger. Haha actually two presidents celebrities. health problems wearing mask long period time? Muslims ethnicity, religion. native Brits converted Islam. meant probably 'people arabic descent'. think wanted asshole. whole exchanged planned didn’t get say flight attendant phrased words differently expected. posted twitter got called passenger  Inside aircraft threat customers. private company rules refused follow. ones arresting him. Get shit together man. think estimate high CDC numbers probably off, seriously doubt it’s order magnitude off. We’ve lot ~3 million actually diagnosed cases. It’s meaningful number. collective? no. Many single people? actually deserve it. person want wear mask deserve it. person voted idiots gave power take wrong decisions deserve it. caught sea stupidity will, deserve it. Yup. US pass option. Michael, can't say ""victory"" expect anything happen... We've gotten point we're hiding covid deaths like we're sort banana republic totalitarian regime anyone else read quote Arnold's voice ? dog, cortisol ≠ cortisone Huh, well think I've ever seen another Nordic politician lie, distort, behave generally dishonestly badly Linde interview. *really* remarkable. made big splash Facebook groups critical Swedes *so* cringeworthy many levels. 

In fact, decided fact check video since full lies, distortions, blame shifting, dodges, etc.: 


1:50 she’s already lying “never problems getting sick people healthcare”. healthcare didn’t collapse per se, it’s [severely strained]( there’s huge scandals around elderly patients denied care [one well respected doctor called “active euthanasia”]( 

Then proceeds say population follows measures, true extent. mobility data clearly show Sweden’s mobilty low countries stricter NPIs evidence ‘NPI fatigue’ setting in. 

She also says ‘legally binding measures like social distancing washing hands, don’t travel, work home’. Charitably misspoke, there’s LAW things Sweden. recommendations. 

She says ECDC lying says [“The initial wave transmission passed peak countries apart Poland Sweden”]( refers Tegnell saying peak passed, he’s saying [for literally months now]( . Hm, one trust, one trust…? 

She says “everybody, every single person even don’t slightest symptom go test yourself” baldfaced lie: 

[But symptoms wanting test enough get referral. also need ""medical assessment"", meaning doctor, nurse medical professional decides whether test.]( http://archive.vn/D0UtU#selection-1015.2-1015.217)

She also says supposedly ‘massive’ amount testing makes can’t compare Sweden countries terms caseload. [Denmark tests WAY Sweden]( active caseload hovering around 500 quite time now. Sweden also still [testing less many countries EU]( mentions ICU capacity indicator, course fails mention denied care. Another example elderly [have encouraged stay home despite serious symptoms]( later died. 

She says there’s new outbreak despite [Gällivare one serious authorities put lockdown]( http://archive.vn/KUnVX ) one doctor said it’s like Stockholm worst.

We’re four minutes it’s wall lies distortions far. 

She scapegoats elder care elder care workers, typically poorly paid treated. blames WORKERS staying home, instead private elder care homes [“tried force staff work despite ill”]( 

She totally dodges next question lack plan protect elder care homes, talks reactions situation. may lies didn’t spot, didn’t notice any. 

She tells lie excess death rate, saying “we don’t excess death rate anymore”. Although lower, still [some degree excess mortality Sweden]( 

She also uses “no one could known!!!” canard. It’s like: yeah one knew sure, everyone coalesced similar strategies Sweden. indicates Sweden ignored quite lot known.

Q: Chief epidemiologist said Sweden might better second wave. Little know this, Sweden special insight?

To credit Linde admit “No one knows herd immunity.” Meaning one knows work. 

Q: considered fast arriving vaccine, worried frontloaded deaths without science back it’s smart move long run?

 Dodges question, plays dumb. “I’m minister foreign affiars”. 

Q: Trust, polls indicate 45% faith strategy compared April 63% did. see damaging? 

No talk talk trust. talk trust people follow recommendations. Cites 80% figure adherence. sure gets figure accurate NPI fatigue setting Sweden like many places: http://archive.vn/qRezx http://archive.vn/GkdQ5

Q: Sweden excluded. think isolated?

Totally unrelated answer repatriation. makes statement border closures “wounds take time heal”. Self inflicted wounds Sweden’s part. 

Q: EU wants border checks lifted soon can’t EU CDC says outbreak hasn’t peaked yet.

Says wishes everyone would open, dodges question ongoing outbreak. 

Q: Economic aspects. EU economic aid opposed “Frugal Four” Sweden one. EU survive you’re gonna like that?

“well sounds like want throw us EU”. Good Odin *ridiculous* statement. No, that’s remotely sounds like. sounds like report thinks Sweden honor obligations vulnerable partners. 

More talk issue end, tbh isn’t interesting me. Although still worth watching end see satisfied look reporter’s face, since really wipe floor Linde favorite thing many fat neck beards use website, don’t believe actually tough people. would use website anyway. feel every redditor must like you. shape useless. it’s case. wants sit 2 hour movie mask on? agree masks help stop spread way I’m taking wife movie sit hours mask. Outdoor comic-con then. give everyone government issued hazmat suit that's required public? (/s, mostly) Ontario 178 new cases 27,000 tests.

Yeah. Many people want border remain closed. Case fatality rate Vox: [Remember N95 mask shortage? It’s still wear mask can't social distance. Sweden blame outbreak Florida farm-workers too? ""just wait 2 weeks"" people now?

Moved onto saying ""I told so!"" recent rises cases act like ""the science settled"" people protested thousands 2 weeks ago explosion cases bit disingenuous. 

Maybe, I'm irritated many people seemingly want others suffer instead anything help. could new flareup, could lasting damage first illness. Here's [WebMD story last changes taste smell may long-lasting effect recovery. since new particular virus know we're talking weeks, months, years forever. hope re-infected sense smell &amp; taste returns normal.  doubt. Grandpa still gets delivered! Yeah, would work basic mask suppose, like said, you’re aerosolizing stuff there’s pitfall. That’s “simple face mask” recommended flow-rate 5-10 LPM 100% O2, would higher risk aerosolizing nasal cannula recommended flow rate 1-6 LPM. Kinda ironic Austrian would make better president got. Maybe demolition man come true all. 47,869 deaths 534,215 recoveries. bad hate pieces shit sell masks others 20 bucks pop wear one. total hole person. Highly unlikely another lockdown occurs AZ evidence suggests spread increasing Florida. Positive tests up, hospitalizations up, deaths up. I'm typically conservative. someone explain seemingly prevalent conservative unwillingness wear mask? understand partisan thing 20 years old sitting home dicking around internet year two mo big deal. got whole life ahead you.

If probably got good years left anyway, maybe would actually prefer take risk spend time left want fo rather locked ip alone home may rest life ""your good"". Referring racist fake news sites ""opposition sites"" says enough account. Thanks downvote btw get away wearing masks health crisis could save lives, able get away wearing clothes regular. wasn't, unless prove Coronavirus. Stock drops time company proactively protecting employees customers. Question???

So scawy letters screen. only... Unless 1st 2nd gen Latino immigrant. particular preference, honest, consume broad variety media know look additional information I'm curious. think expecting single article provide complete picture anything foolish. muh freedom! gonna happen. Americans much ""I gotta get mine, screw everyone else"" attitude. IE: wear mask, don't. quarantine yourself, don't. There's gross reporting south. know actual death counts while.

At minimum mandatory masks brainer Yeah. 30 year old friend died. I'm risking shit. Sports viewing following coping mechanism many folks. use phrase Karl Marx (originally used describe religion), ""Opiate Masses.""

It's also yearly routine ritual folks. defending sports fanatics, understandable folks upset they're thrown routines. That's huge takeaway lockdowns COVID restrictions- saw important daily routines maintaining sanity. look letters capital. squaRes vs cool kiDs think first letter major american parties also, people think virus hoax, masks either. kills people? Wearing masks? tells much confidence research, using season instead month Spike cases, yes. people able get tested previously. explain spike hospitalizations? check Texas Medical Center's stats fairly regularly, hospitalization number think tells story. Imagine making much money athletes demanding go back job essential. 

Next wanting hazard pay. 1) receiving accurate data government likely, yes. promise accurate masks help slow spread diseases. inaccurate reporting case death numbers really unfortunate sad true, nothing mandatory mask order.

2) disagree requiring people wear piece cloth public space heavy handed response. minor inconvenience most. also already required wear clothes public see additional required piece clothing bad.

China got hit way way less hard America. Completely incomparable numbers especially America months prepare China didn't. operating assumption believe China's numbers, personally know certain masks actually effective slowing spread thing.

Oh, ok man believe masks help literally wrong. doubt I'm gonna one convince otherwise tbh  rushed vaccine.

Yeah George Washington born British colony (I.e. America) still let become president

And Arnie acted inamericsn movies, led america’s Largest state (California) governor, lived America lot longer George Washington did.

So it’s good enough George Washington Arnie? Cause talks funny?  See also: Hitler. I'm health care worker protests I'm extremely torn this.

I definitely trust government information know many hospitals would fight protect it. actual quote, actual evidence said it.

But let's give benefit doubt, let's say say it.

Some people act like testing tantamount cure, really isn't. test people go hospital known symptoms? course. people apparently think need test everyone country every week. Why? end? country way big contact tracing, police state like China North Korea, we're going locking people quarantine disease kills less 1 percent people infected it. yes, ways, testing overrated. Mass testing cure.

As whether ""wear facial coverings way signal disapproval him,"" guess never know...oh, wait true, indeed wear facial coverings way signal disapproval him. can't prove people wear masks exclusively make statement, vs also wearing facial covering required live, trying responsible people. hand, gives crap?

What think going happen country continues exit quarantine dude? Hint: virus suddenly stop spreading

Also, want say, thank pleasant. deserve nice replies giving me, I've working getting better trying get upset opinions differ mine. trying genuine discussion I'm angryposter apologise... Used fun getting mad people get mad back lol Comparing many people die normal year vs. many people die covid gives us number ""excess mortality"". excess mortality compares confirmed covid deaths varies countries USA pretty close know number confirmed covid deaths reasonably close truth.

Regardless England Britain / neither American point I’m making. America’s first president wants even born America racists still want prevent foreigners becoming president.

I think he's confused condition has. condition *actually* fact reason he's wearing mask. guys bankrupted? spring back life sudden Yep carolina's too.. spiraling control. NY rest North-east safest part country far..... remember correctly sure first masks people touching faces (which bullshit excuse give someone mask). Pondered decision months testing decided mask better mask even touch it.

What right virus developed passed one bat another densely packed (relatively) indoor space. Evolution would favored generations virus adapted environment. Adaptation always trade offs though, there's good chance well adapted cave environment made less well adapted open air environments.

Our homes buildings are, basically, sophisticated artificial caves. That's well adapted transmissable indoors.

My point opportunity give virus pass people outdoors, selective pressure exerted virus tolerate outdoor conditions.

This may, net, good thing becomes less adapted indoors spend time. difficult know sure point though. Protests cause increase cases.

So one part it: there's someone (best guess Swedish government) actively trying sweep rug. 

But another factor Sweden people trust system much think many trouble conceptualizing could happen there. can't accept facts presented. Won’t enforced.

A Venn diagram police officers people refuse wear masks would circle. shocked 10,000+ infected day point. we'll never see numbers simply they're slow walking testing much can. well said. climate seems accuse get angry first, ask questions never :( another source source “for dummies” doesn’t make feel good.

It also explains “The common types averages mean, median, Vaccines limited effectiveness time, actually measles, mumps rubella give lifetime immunity (though apparently everybody?). Immunity generally higher actually disease rather vaccine.

Given older people likely *had* diseases children, seems strange protecting them. I've three (born 1964) given MMR shot teens (which completely unneeded). 40s, doctor test R antibodies still high levels, figure I'm good.

As testing capacity increases, trend positivity rate consistently downward trend, increase testing naturally lead negative results. 

If stays same, that's also mostly fine indicates least spreading faster testing, potentially accurate picture rate spread. 


If, however, positivity rate increases testing increases, bad. IF, case Florida Texas, positivity rate increasing higher rate increases testing rate, even worse. Excellent point completely correct! purely focusing elderly, completely right SNFs also used rehabilitation. asthma triggered by? masks made from?

How treating asthma today?  Brav-fucking-O.  say BLM protester. Covid affect theater praise courage.

Iphone well. WEARING MASKS POLITICAL make claim they're it. 

No - never claimed that. strawmanning here. 

I asked question done avoid answering it. 

Why that? 

You zero idea strategies effect across Europe report ECDC gives recommendations. 

And yet keep harping Sweden needs join Europe TTI strategies. 

Why that? 

Why can't answer question? highest number deaths Florida April 28. Prior recent spike, highest number daily recorded cases April 11. seem think time different, vastly greater number recorded cases lead deaths. evidence that? 

If think increase case numbers increased testing, show us normalized figures prove case. stats difficult do, getting real emotional without sharing testing data that's essential position. Covid sham complete bull.

Here Texas data.  

You see tests administered linear progression. increase rate testing.

You look hospitalizations. one they've already giving 'workers'? may may not. depends titer levels. doctor request bloodwork done lab, it’s blood draw. I’m 25 still positive titers MMR (meaning still immunity). doctors skip titers give booster anyway though. Weirdly enough, I’m non-responder Hep B vaccine. jabbed childhood series adult series still immunity (which sucks I’m nurse). believe goal post moved. original post belief people higher degrees get higher vote. current state world would bad. counter points higher education mean intelligent intelligent people automatically good people.

I’m going criticize people exercising freedom speech, right gather together protest though it’s ideal, Green overly concerned. Uhhhh, that’s works. spike cases people spreading around, you’re finding spread increased testing. question. guess ""unwritten rule"" people taking masks eat/drink/relax actual movie. barely enforce cell phone use movie, guess different. True...but... Giving 2$ per trip grocery store means one less meal per visit. Sorry, im giving eating guise public saftey local government opens bars gatherings 50 people.

Additionally, 2 alone. packages masks valued 2$ buy multiple time. I've living 75$ month rent since April, can't spare 12$ pack masks.

Funny left ""reopening"" headline second paragraph. asthma. Mask wearing trigger it, least me.

I think one common misconception asthma I’ve heard things make hard breathe trigger asthma. reality, difficulty breathing symptom asthma, cause. 

Asthma commonly triggered things: allergens, exercise, cold air, stress/anxiety. others, folks chronic asthma common hear about. 

Stress/anxiety trigger might associate mask wearing. instance, would highly recommend someone keep rescue inhaler nearby follow steps asthma action plan. Many people stress-induced asthma may still able wear mask, even need temporarily remove treat asthma attack. 

Mask wearing may actually help asthma triggered allergens, mask may filter problematic allergens. noticed rarely ever need sneeze wearing mask, remarkable given many things I’m allergic to. would also expect mask wearing help cold-induced asthma, cloth barrier may take bite cold air (like breathing scarf winter). 

I doctor. someone dealt asthma 25 years. asthma isn’t severe people’s, it’s still moderately uncontrolled careful. comment opinion intended taken actual medical advice. 

A final reminder: wear mask protect people, protect myself. able wear mask, helping protect absolutely cannot wear mask. That’s able wear masks. mask protects you, mask protects me. punishment per se, simple statement gives people opportunity change lose ability fly airline future. best without pointing gun them, nobody wants.

Even stop today, mitigates problem long term, important so. Live events would massacre pandemic rely fellow countrymen help till over. programs US help out? Well see could mutate like sars less deadly first go around. knows could give less shit though. We're fucked. Yup, went pick food last night Famous Sams place packed. Pretty sure one wearing mask. watched documentary it. wake patients take ventilator talking explain month is.

Here article intubation. confirms never said Eh really relevant like sure guys douche he’s hardly racist news ate written human, human biased nature. try read news make judgement yourself, even biased. peaked 50% higher countries, think they're beginning long decline now. Gonna take forever deaths peaked yet, I'd guess they've seen single day new case peak. dare try challenge America, number one spot can’t Yeah think people misunderstanding. think we're done Federal lockdowns, counties still decide themselves. Knowing know virus, think we're safe leave counties moreso states decide themselves. Rural areas need strict measures like city might. country get fucked. wearing mask keep getting sick become political issue?

Boggles mind One study determine whole body science.

One presser replace peer review study. really get logic. irrelevant improving filtration quality cabin air. know that's something they're also actively doing.

Is something article says they're choosing mandatory face masks instead improving health safety policies? they're ""ensuring hold accountable?""  seen many countries. older risk population less likely bring initially, eventually younger mobile population (where spreads initially) pass well (eg. via younger workers nursining homes, etc). age distribution tended shift older later epidemic wave countries. Lol wtf. still discussion. linked CDC, saying incorrect order magnitude. CDC, remind you, used source diamond princess numbers. also offered chance find reputable source talking symptomatic fatality rate closer 5%. didnt. data would there, remotely close 5%, would able find journal talking it. Instead link 30 min YouTube video? Sorry bud, ill take CDC, every medical journal world youtuber lololol.

Offer still stands, find recent study says symptomatic fatality rate around 5%. Prove point rescind it, data there. Tell CDC wrong too, lol. NYT never misses opportunity ensure know he’s CONSERVATIVE, really, he’s lying attention whore.

""He's unfairly targeted, dare infringe personal freedoms"" 

but also like:

""Its right give service people white, heterosexual, religious personal business"" Breaking news: sky blue cows go moo Additionally, different way wording it. liberal movement liberal side house thinks progressive side divisive choosing disassociate. massive summarization. Well Chick-fil-A close while. rumor associate COVID. Turns closed cleaned even test results came in. guy tested negative.  data shown COVID-19 hospitalization only. good going up. Historical data seems indicate 10 day doubling unchecked. guess would 14 days without changes. However; think mask usage increase think testing ramped enough capture 10K new cases daily. example Texas testing 28K average currently, see expanding testing 50K see positivity rate going 20%. 

So, think soon (if already) 10K new cases day, think tracked. go beach? everyone saying it’s spreading from? Washington has, actually.

That number CA already record high good. Imagine number state 1/5 population. Despite bad idea, think continue play. Shit really going hit fan announcer, coach, training passes away. Sure athletes might low-risk demographic, tons managers, coaches, staff high-risk category. happens Andy Reid gets sick? Charlie Manuel? Unfortunately think thing stop sports going fall major death. Percentage positive tests increasing well people getting tested. Hey thanks! That’s good place even lurk. Link . anyone wanna read  saying forever now, nothing guarantees anyone falsifying data. hospital wants look bad. state wants look bad. Unfortunately, many places could sitting many cases anyone, few, know about. there's large 3rd party gathers data, cannot trust private companies politicians, something gain looking good, right thing time. instituted policy saying mayor's can't make stricter requirements cities beyond set forth.

Why ban people dont wear masks? sure extra politics twist added. Promising future punishment (I'd use ""consequences"") rules. That's rules do. impose option consequences, versus compliance. Comply pay known price. Rules basic part every day everybody. smells like publicity stunt. Generate huge amounts controversy intentionally go public it. Probably wants next Milo. US less around 16,000 cases per day since like late February

First wave even close yet Exactly 

The testing argument made raw numbers increasing, hospitalization nothing testing, it’s symptom-based 

If hospitalizations up, testing testing it’s good sign got money people made lie. 

Keep business China, keep eggs basket. promise won’t work much longer. Yeah would nice know 500 doing.

10/500 pretty bad death toll assuming working age folks wear mask pandemic boo fucking hoo Obviously everyone else refuses wear mask airplane banned EVERY flight life.
Selfish cunts. Perfect time protest rally. Imagine mad he’ll take media’s attention away  sounds like Swedish culture treats weed tobacco. health effects two quite different. Swedish culture absorbed this? brother sounds like he’s reasonable trying staying home unlikely get plane trump rally refuse wear one. Theaters CEO Adam Aron said Friday theaters require patrons wear masks upon reopening, begin mid-July. Customers don’t wear masks won’t admitted allowed stay.

I’m surprised that’s direction reversal went. good call theaters. live Arizona right now, people acting virus isn’t real. customer told we’re going okay bars full much fun nightclub. Jesus. OP literally said ""despite spike cases"" - implying cases dropping, people affected infected ones getting it. Yes, may correct deaths go back up, OP pretty spot on. 

Which, said, seems like pretty ideal outcome. Maybe that's said. want better job. There's hardly thing. want get jobs altogether, way work. source this? I'm saying wrong numbers would make sense. rolled ball gone away US throwing tantrum? amen last sentence👍👍 This. don’t disagree should...but we’ve dragging feet contact tracing along. seems odd timing make point ask protests. ask mass gatherings general, perhaps give examples protests, rallies, concerts...then see sentiment quite different. tell people wear masks. That's basically it, nothing's stopping people gathering, businesses implement see fit. Parties, people over, etc, happening since summer now. shame. Unfortunately, I'd hate see it, surprise see plenty states start rising like others, since there's really nothing place track stop people traveling spreading virus. ""I WEAR MASK""

The pathetic hill (in cases literally) die on. still credability?? still taking say seriously? litterally said virus cant transmit human human. info propably fake Yeah makes sense. country Europe? required wear masks enclosed spaces, outdoors. least Romania. least theory. activist really means you’re trying change things- could trying change worse change back (not ever actually way). tell open-up idiots brigading city subs trying shift narrative way. /r/Chicago every single comment criticizing local leaders safety measures highly upvoted gilded *immediately*, comments supporting measures downvoted attacked **many** users history ever posting sub.

They completely disappeared past week so. Illinois Chicago following data guidelines letter cases (relatively) low stable, allowing us *reliably* get closer opening safely. AZ FL. Food source? point keep schools closed offer online classes highly reduced tuition.

DING DING DING money. That's schools desperately trying person classes. Damn right calling little monster. People known died pandemic. One considered healthy. Perhaps statistical noise directly affects life. know hit home people yet, deny seriousness lead pandemic first place. long term effects lie. Nah counted pnemonia deaths something else before.  Yet are, several posts deep fighting something know nothing about. wonder love forum fit right in. isn’t difficult ventilator isn’t suffering one heavily sedate like go colonoscopy. wake up, aren’t aware time passed. civil left activists too, activists bad giving sides bad reputations There’s also potentially 20 States seeing numbers ticking up.

Not quite. They're liars know they'll get away base understand math statistics well enough know they're bullshitted. stocks dropping. making lose money shit people threat citizens, need whole new country send to... big one that... (like Lichtenstein enough...) I've staff advisor non-frat club.

People stressed tests really party. I've organized small get togethers them, everyone abandons ship 10:00 PM Friday. Numbers, opinion happen. [new cases state 100k state 100k lag cases weeks, tell whether becaues testing, wait weeks. People dont die day get tested. Cases steady like two weeks started increasing

EDIT: also cases canada rapidly dropping last weeks well guess re-open open air arenas then. Baseball, Football, Concerts. also church mass funerals outside, right? Fair enough. I’ve come grips part it. agree it’s unfair project hatred onto everybody prison. prison pedos, rapist, 1st degree murders, I’d say open flood gates corona. let jog destination Pipe get smacked little man Also dont forget masks dumb ""Mask, mask?

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ friend lied to, spreading it. Honestly I'm surprised Texas, Arizona, Florida completely shut reporting numbers. half-expect say ""This virus dead, we're wasting lot taxpayer dollars compiling data, flu we're anymore"". Warm weather defeating virus. people spending time indoors AC spreading around bet. fairly old ad figures haven’t updated since learned average age death 79-81. one rough calc puts average 1,000 days stolen average. could use updating though. large number people tied personal identity President, means stand every knuckleheaded thing lest admit Emperor clothes. gonna point false information see it

So deal highest risk (humans), keep cats home, mink pig factories around world already starting take precautions, best keep dog away dogs, people, poop...

That addresses risk right there. may enough. 
Currently, biggest problem far highest risk (humans) ""bored"" taking precautions.  Pancreas damage blood clots two significant aspects COVID people don’t realize.

The mask wearing make conservative, conservative political views that. Jesus man. seem like pretty angry hateful person yourself. jumping conclusions damning someone views, check saying tell that’s better? 

I’m trying educate right asking people’s opinions looking someone provide new insight. yet, view hasn’t changed entirely nobody revealed ground breaking concept me. stems back thing, ‘people good people even people shitty.’ disagree don’t fully understand concept why.

Your response one common, “you bigot” “you hateful prick” “you white privileged fuck”. intellectual eye opening. 
My view criminal punishment nothing white privilege. several family members prison conversation people many different skin tones. 

Though see strong opinions emotions driven toward violent sexual criminals, clearly everyone prison, buzzword filled SHW comment nothing new understanding me. 
Thanks literally nothing, maybe work trying speak everyone else thread. lack care change view doesn’t reflect everyone else here. keeping dogs leads. basic measures responsible pet owners taking already, regardless coronavirus. called dead pan :) lung probably scarred life. really much different forms pneumonia.

Pneumonia pretty scary COVID-19 leads pneumonia much higher rates compare flu. Yeah, even keep toilet paper stocked... Great. trash healthcare get worse. 

Meanwhile everyone that's asymptomatic can't get tested go around spreading without realizing it. don’t helmet law state. Venn diagram people refuse wear helmet motorcycle people refusing wear masks circle. part bullshit? Ok you’re confident go spend day COVID unit come back report us stuff pockets store bought candy. Can't hate know. believe referring Measles, Mumps, Chicken Pox, Rubella aka German Measles.  

They childhood diseases back day, less serious children. Becoming infected recovering confers life long immunity.  

Now vaccine. problem taking given necessary.

We sold flattening curve, necessary, did. Staying lockdown til vaccine necessary frankly, agreed population. Bullshit 100%... come man, know better that.  plenty idiots left. posting support masks. 

And they're public failing social distance wear mask they've always got great excuse it. 

America stupid country. public educational system failure.  people willfully illiterate. 

And none really matters Covid19 tiny blip climate change wrecks civilization drives us extinction. Automod deletes comments contain word "" r n g e "" civil trash allowed stay? ""tolerant l e f t"" finest. maybe finally get Chinese leash.

Aaaanyway whole conditionally good news since evidence Sweden pivoting towards Test, Trace, Isolate. think thing look closely would improve contact tracing really ready soon see major new outbreaks, think that’s we’re going see ... think it’s really important able handle outbreaks different parts Sweden quickly can’t spread Sweden implemented contact-tracing system outbreak emerged country overwhelmed number infections rose dramatically, Tegnell (contact tracing) weeks Sweden happened really overwhelmed massive amount importation (of cases), especially area Stockholm, Spring Break. much contact tracing handle. back (at) reasonable levels think come back better work time.”

YES. Please. pivot TTI now, instead talking it. Talking good first step, please put action. Congregate deaths NC account approximately 71% covid deaths.

Per NCDHHS 6/18

1175 total deaths - 343 non-congregate aren’t locking down, surge began! they’re stressed now, 2 weeks nightmare. virus fuckin confusing. safe pandemic cool pandemic 😎 economy affects safety people well. cut dry issue. simply easy, Governors like Newsome Cuomo done good job mostly, still opening things up. would shut completely. can't, flip side killing economy... causes whole set problems kill people well. Buh bye AMC sad wish people knew young, completely healthy guys spend months sore balls catch this?

I feel like put nuts line, even hard-headed could start take seriously... Everything bigger Texas. Yep, takes least 3 years small business even turn profit. amount virus particles x10 higher week before! Contact tracing NL weak (most cases can't traced origin), 1 *known* positive case. Dutch increasingly relaxed, 3/4 *with* symptoms plan get tested sure corona. Well... Eh look numbers infected states seriously slowed first peak levels. problem you’re correct. didn’t actually go away enough us consider gone. Me? No, gay!!! makes lot sense actually quite comforting. people puzzled ""lack"" second wave - things reopened, spike?

This might provide answer. exponential growth fast later stages, also generally really slow beginning. Covid-19 specific symptoms sign distinguish clearly bad cold influenza - makes sense first dozens cases went completely unnoticed. probably happened December, possibly even earlier.

This means order reach level reached early March, forced lockdown widespread was, need four weeks... needs twelve more. lookout mistake flu again... could ever much time spread like again? Effective contact tracing plus social distancing means might safe second wave.

So, yeah, great news. forge birth certificate run President? real problem keep admitting people hospitals. They'd plenty hospital capacity they'd turn new patients away  Testing sites closed country last weeks there's way prove outdoor activities pose smaller risk spread virus. Especially people close proximity. 

Also let's forget rise ""pneumonia"" deaths. please stop spreading made bullshit. Books seem. \*cues freebird Brigade wont like :/ going blame victims here? depressing. I'm saying okay long result HI. price worth paying goal achieved. it’s a;ready starting California re-elect guy banged Latina?

Who KNOWS expression lips, new 2020 pandemia that's new norm #2020coveredfacegetadate  know straw man is? It’s false argument. say false argument? Boycott corporate trash. “It really feel like U.S. given up,” said Siouxsie Wiles, infectious-diseases specialist University Auckland New Zealand — country confirmed three new cases last three weeks citizens largely returned pre-coronavirus “I can’t imagine must like go work knowing it’s unsafe,” Wiles said U.S.-wide economic reopening. “It’s hard see ends. going people infected, deaths. It’s China’s actions past week stand stark contrast United States. wake new cluster 150 new cases emerged Beijing, authorities sealed neighborhoods, launched mass testing campaign imposed travel restrictions.

As American, cannot fathom country cares people. foreign concept.

There's honor mass slaughter. violence inflicted upon us. Sweden ""the 2nd infected country world"" (article headline)? [Not according actual resource provided Wait. increased testing, migrant farm workers?

If DeSantis insists migrant farm workers increasing case numbers, increased case numbers due increased testing?

Can least choose one lie go with? Look happened Wisconsin. people vote person caused outbreak. gather lot people indoors, creates greater risk. words ""no, can't.""

So I'm going use Hitchen's Razor dismiss whole arguemet wrong, nothing it. 

It's incorrect arguement, take personal responsibility stop asking people prove point you.  You’re moron bought this. Assuming death rate sick people 5% - seems data shows - means 175,000 Swedes must die get heard immunity

IFR (not sick, infected) like 0.3% average, see even cdc.gov. age groups it's:

Mass hysteria depends place. state like 600 vivid deaths. likely even noticed testing. would wow flu really hard elderly nursing homes year. 

Places like NYC mass transit maybe takes worse. Also help tossing covid people back nursing homes.  Yeah people weird belief everyone worse mask we'd get rid virus. papers stating published people experience virus transmission peer-reviewed.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* considering virus permanent fixture patients. week two ago people infected, means new cases still spreading. viruses spread exponentially, continue speed nothing done it.

Also, let's consider hospitalizations. Assuming positive outlook 100 per 3000 stays constant, that's rate roughly 3%. Without stopping new cases, virus could eventually make way entire population 21.48 million Floridians, 644k potential hospitalizations. quick look costs says hospitalized patient costs average $30k treat. would $19 billion would need paid patient, insurance, government assistance (assuming run out). Somebody going bankrupt. suspected. know fully protests would cause. Precaution touted still good thing. Look man i'm going too. risk need stay home That's actually lot. Florida total 6000 ICU available covid. regular use without convid already 50 75% meaning best times 3000 beds available entire Florida, realistically 1500 200 left. quarter hospitalisations goes ICU that's 50 per day stays way is. stay ICU 2 weeks 750 bringing closer max peek everybody even leaves ICU 2 weeks average. However people equally spread hospitalization need ICU multiple locally overwhelmed clusters ICU others would capacity. areas hit hard. state wide average close max always translates local overwhelmed parts par. actually went Trump's logic, see coming. think governors would stoop low. mah constitutions say die hill want!

Just like Baby Jesus WWII. man, looks, treats others? Surely latter. Surely taking others health seriously manly. Claims contrary certainly naive immature. Lots southern schools this. Less common north. Time toss salad. agree. U.S. think also talking point cover total failure government preparing responding pandemic. many masks go around ability make more.

Instead admitting that, asking citizens cope makeshift masks able ramp production, top officials hit airwaves try convince people wear masks.

What stupid fucking approach. wonder nobody trusts media government anymore wearing mask politicized. entirely self-inflicted, preventable injury. Mark Wahlberg? protect virus. sick anything, stay home. There’s need cover face I’m sick. Hey, one geniuses too! Thanks! lol common outcome coronaviruses many vaccines.

One biggest problems SARS vaccine faced order trigger immune response significant enough confer immunities, became dangerous vaccination.

Unfortunately, immunity studied Phase 3.

With Phase 1 trials, goal identify maximum amount vaccine that's safe take. vaccines make Phase 1.

Phase 2, trial pool opens less healthy people get better understanding dose impacts diverse population. 

Phase 3 actually examines dose sufficient enough build immunity play around variety delivery approaches. looks like 100%. understand wanting side protesters... even LOTS wearing masks, 100% enough cause issues. people bars night clubs fucking morons too, pretend protesters perfect.

That's fact fuck nut justice porn Harris county dropped 1.1k holy shit. We've covering mouth cough ages, take science... Common sense enough! favor. Pull NY Times Coronavirus map view hotspots. south action is, despite hot humid weeks now. would nice virus magically disappear summer ain't happening.

I work water utility, luckily tied City in. okay financially since people still need water residential use gone up. However, also rely new construction new tap fees... overall budget last months one building anything new moment. 

So limping along right now, hoping everyone still able pay bills. still money coming in, enough operate everything cutting budgets pretty heavily.

No travel, conferences, hiring freeze least end year. large capital projects, turn affects contractors hire work, engineers designing projects, suppliers material, etc...

Thinking bounce right back soon reopen literally pipe dream, pun intended. Well, find out. mask worn, maybe 10 minutes. Four hours big change... Europe even [tested let alone introduce widespread tracing methods. ten countries tested 10% population. 25 countries tested less 5%. France tested 2.1%. thre 12 countries tested less 2.5%. - little exeception - large, widescale testing carried country Europe. 

So regardless countries tracing, majority countries Europe rolled extensive testing programs.

So - bearing mind bearing mind real clue Europe relation TTI.. tell keep pretending Europe rolled extensive TTI programs really know that's actually case? Yesterday brown people, today it’s younger people it, they’ll giving blue hairs shortly there’s mitigation efforts made.

And cases hit hospitals...

Come Ron, know spin know, virus doesn’t care. Turn nutty media get air, kid. Scientifically sound, reasonable health safety guidelines = ""mob mentality""

Idiots. going keep reporting this, news? job can't ""socially distant"" cases - hopefully healthy people involved. spiking everywhere then? Another unique way presenting data ignore days decreases label day increase OUTBREAK lmao. Nope, crowd. “plandemic” fan.

But don’t fall victim clickbait nature way online headlines work order generate revenue days either.

Wait find doctors real medicine them. ""Hey doc I'm sick,"" ""oh ok stay home call 911 trouble breathing come hospital fever gets 103"" 

They're gonna want see manager Covid. saw article face shields, saying good.

Lock doors get he’s ‘ex’-FDA chief. bet current chief wouldn’t say this. even get test results back till 3 weeks later...thankfully negative though! think that’s fair question ask. make mass gatherings. could church graduation party too. primary schools area opened. Man seems like terrible idea healthcare worker protesting fucking pandemic.  Sorry grandpa. Remember, passing thing, shadow, even darkness must pass. Take care. Abbott outsourcing contact tracing team Indian corporation CEO (I think) faked college degree. worries much this. shit hits fan going actually impact? wonder much saved. also anxiety people anxiety stuff want time. stay home time anxiety go see people wearing masks incorrectly, wearing them, crowding, touching everything other, etc. 

If anxiety wearing mask wants go Trump rally, get pass wearing mask flight. emergency necessary trip reason would say could possibly exception, non-essential leisure trip. later say virus unpredictable unfortunately “carelessness” chose protest etc sabotaged meticulous reopening strategy.. none empty suits ever admit gambled public’s health keep boosters happy. ventilator/intubation

That scares catching COVID. Especially since typical ICU protocols ignored. People getting worse treatment staff fears catching COVID. reason delirium rates high COVID patients. 

That live serious lung damage rest life. Iron deficiency affects immune system iron deficiency anemia (assuming that's has, since specify) makes person prone getting infections, going public unless necessary Thanks elaborating!  global warming??? 😎








... /s Thank you. It’s obvious protests increased spread. It’s common sense. may turn spreading covid amongst younger healthy population good thing herd immunity. it’s obvious people falling victim confirmation bias point single study say “see? Protests didn’t spread virus”. course protests led community spread. Well, addressing too... agreeing headline makes seem like airline banned political stance, inconsiderate asshole holding airplane.

It political stance. I'll bet dollars donuts *was* deliberate grab publicity. last acting gig 2005. total anonymity 2108, started appearing Fox News. cut Hollywood, like many others, saw $$$ realized success DJT playing conservatives. Seriously, guy liberal, re-brand liberal ""Wake"", rejecting left.

Kinda like trump Mini-Me. record, agree you. want discussion pandemic reported way is. would quite punch balls said beds enough skilled nurses willing continuously risk lives. could 3 month ordeal. Instead persist well 2021 refusing wear mask considered virtue-signal, support police state? It’s shame many people traveling / hard contact trace. called gaslighting. haven’t looked Texas, Florida June testing numbers even, less than, May testing completed movie theaters, nba, nhl, nba, mls, wnba, F1, nascar, wwe, pga, ufc, boxing, schools, concerts, festivals, cruises...on on...everything cut avoid gatherings. Yet leader country knows everyone else. hate wish bad things upon people please let 5 people get it. want prez get rather Jr, Ivanka, Jared, bimbo press secretary, someone, anyone. kind narcissist would make rally important peoples safety. wish Dwayne Johnson cast expendables TV ad masks show still macho mask.  changes even people's perceptions would say worth it. never seen anyone beeing able lookup pages notes use question got... incredible good at...

Come dance every night, sing hula melody might wanna reword last sentence there. Okay boomer...

The youngest generation far best educated, far internet-literate parents, problem ones getting tricked... heard someone say Trump bought virus China exactly reason. It’s probably true, I’ve heard people pretty different social circles. save risk relatives? went costco today sugar land saw like 98% people wearing mask properly like 2% mask around necks. wish they’d enforce mask rule store doors tbh Anti scientific bias problem Darwin’s day. shouldn’t problem Whether people ill enough hospitalized determined whether they've coronavirus test. know provide source saying two things unrelated, though! think taking pictures people w=o permission uncool illegal [Joe Arpaio wait, thought whole virus Joe Biden Funded Fake News

its scientists tried warn us Trump see fox news. [parks Brooklyn mean, America probably case unfortunately lol. Hospitalizations lot people sick /s Also killing innocent essential workers family members. Don’t idiot. 40 Million people REQUIRED wear masks. 

Very good thing proud governor. Black people US recieve measurably worse standard care, including denied admittance hospitals much higher rate whites. February April 3rd said masks.

That true cases people reasonable would expected come contact covid would doctors. Also shortage masks best conserve doctors point.

The experts didnt lie, source insightful! I’m 34. Mom 53. problem. mom middle school dropout (poor family, work) never thought stupid antivax started making rounds.

Nothing surprises anymore. asked fuck Bill Gates needs microchips track us carry around damn cell phone EVERYWHERE Facebook installed it? answer? don’t know, it’s microchip me. feel like I’m living parallel universe Idiocracy prophetic... Sending pms good friends, caring friends, care affected anyone know. think blown proportion. also believe president lies. 

I friends - mostly male - wont wear mask. relative tested positive. mild symptoms. back end April. zero symptoms, can’t seem test negative. She’s taking nasal swab tests positive, inconclusive, positive. saliva ones positive, negative, negative positive. What’s going on? still contagious? keep taking tests? 

Her live boyfriend taken saliva ones. Positive, negative, negative. Don’t know matters.

Thanks! Agree disagree guess. ideas may ‘questionable’ writing top notch. “We want drawn political controversy,” said Aron. “We thought might counterproductive forced mask wearing people believe strongly necessary. think vast majority AMC guests wearing masks. go AMC feature, certainly wearing mask leading 

so brave reality “Big Pharma” states wants exploit human suffering profit, doesn’t take away peer-reviewed studies telling wear mask prevent thousands deaths. part comment categorized “incivility” ? Thank you. Surely someone virus attend malevolence disguised supporter proceed infect others start domino effect sabotage killing core voters Fuck I’m down. tested positive anti-bodies figure I’m immune enough Tenet idiot got eaten ruined everyone.

That part busting up. Sorry can't bear bro. maybe someday :(  point, need see states hiring training COVID responders. know diagnose, treat, manage exactly one infection, supervised nurses doctors freed rotate among larger number patients. shitty public education system constantly defund overworked teachers try mold critical thinking skills kids starters that's piss parents every time finish semester college come home opinions make sense 2020 outdated opinions make sense given time growing political climate 70s, 80s 90s. Every country share unfortunate idiots. go gut?

And big uh brain. I'm sure whether countering supporting post.

H1N1 one least deadly flu seasons record. 

I pointing CDC recommended use facemasks non-medical professionals certain situations. odd benefit. forget breathe out, germs go away. sit air - waiting next person walk through. pass free mask doorways. also coughing guy standing near lol. State/City/County inspectors involved fining revoking licences businesses/places public health risk. police used final escalation needed, enforcement mechanism themselves. people guns hips make issue worse, especially tasked resolving issue own.  


The issue Police fit issuing tickets without escalating things further/targeting minority communities. Pennsylvania included list? number daily cases Michigan population smaller. Also Pennsylvania’s cases decreasing longer. Yes, Danes infamous hatred Scandinavians. disagree lot people think way. IMO much simpler : majority people give shit sure happen them.

Just like murder, rape, genocide name seen media, deny real, real sense happen them. Willful ignorance sprinkle selfishness. Source? falling Oklahoma while. cares confirmed cases increasing?

At least two things might cause confirmed cases raise deaths fall are:

 * Number infections dropping. Testing adequately measuring number cases. 
 * Much better treatment

IMO seem like good news me. don’t leave America it’s awful place? likely discovered Wuhan well November - so, Chinese reported iit knew virus - whether intentionally - came one labs.

Norwegian virologist Birger Sørensen, new peer-reviewed paper published together Professor Angus Dalgleish St George’s Hospital University London, Sorensen claims novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 natural origin.

According study, which Quarterly Review Biophysics, authors found coronavirus’s spike protein contains sequences appear artificially inserted. 

“The inserted sequences never published. today, would never happened. big mistake Chinese made. inserted sequences functionality describe. explain essential. Chinese pointed first,” 

They also found virus doctored bind humans: 

“We aware findings could political significance raise troubling questions.” 

The two researchers also pointed virus hardly mutated since began infect humans, suggesting already fully adapted humans. According Sørensen, unusual viruses cross species barriers. According Sørensen, virus properties differ greatly SARS, never detected nature. 

Sørensen said, “When technically describe virus, see come natural development. It’s done Americans Chinese, part what’s called “gain function” studies. done world. say don’t, happens time advanced labs.” 

But see - seen throughout 'pandemic' - massive surge media 'debunk' study. fact much 'debunking' going days, along 'fact checking', tells story.... basically anything suit current Covid-1984 narrative 'fake news', ' conspiracy theory'. 

Why that? 

If current narrative actually strong enough stand scrutiny critical questioning, need debunk everything off-hand. Yet is.

Maybe current Covid-1984 narrative knows pushed, questioned scrutinised, actually stand up? listen people expertise subject. 

As anywhere near capable assessing this, happens majority us agree sentiment. 

Boy... sure echo chamber effect else seems fully charged straw men arguments think ads validity opinions.

He says, making straw man argument. technically ppl local government like ppl give parking tickets, think personally given individuals person. think possible fine businesses individuals business they. businesses make sure workers follow rules can/should business follow ppl side make sure babies take masks? Unless hit individual pockets simply blame businesses never comply. home engineering, ppl know responsible US long history huge anti intellectualism problem.

Its fucking bizarre turned tables the? first see Florida end title thought armed insurrection public execution infidels OC California. Yep. Permitting dine-in stupid. Flew couple weeks ago. Everyone plane worse mask, people airport were.

Honestly nicest time I've ever flying [""We depend summer people, Texas BTW. people losing shit (understandably) Governor announcing schools reopen in-person instruction fall, statewide requirement students mask get checked COVID symptoms entering school buildings understandable wouldnt want wear mask clog shit coming mouths. smart people work, parents vulnerable age group, havent seen person 3 months, care appreciate that. Greg Abbott fuckwad talking sides mouth months. refused let local governments enforce kind preventative measures months, he's pretending better solution along stupid see it. He's claiming government authority directly require people wear masks, require businesses require customers wear masks. Except that's exactly Dallas County last month, Abbott's administration forced stop. 

So, yeah, Abbott might actually let Turner enforce this, idea.  Phase 1 says June 4th. Two weeks article written. Notice two week pattern? That’s funny would say people accepting things labeled “science” happen fit politics bit problem. know is.

To honest shocking thing actually invited you. Anymore? say it’s something new. told us wear masks scared shortage... don’t believe anything say. Far I'm concerned, one hundred people died thing, that's damn many. One person dying world itself. That's fucking *life*. hate feel like cornball ""snowflake"" stating that. casual sociopathy I've witnessed past couple months, even people know live with, vexing.  think shutdowns happen regardless. Business's going suffer since everyone's going risk it. That's reopening sluggish . open mean people going. See find new cases day chart. Also known epi curve.

Here - new cases specimen collection date (takes ages load). regular low days weekends. great last week Fines far well. kids today climates! critically viewing facts... smugness sub bunch people probably never took college level science course way damn high. I'm American, I'm still confused. 🤣🤣You may something actual number people immunity definitely much higher that. _lot_ factors. think possible say point. Plus, depend heavily nature hurricane. One floods city causing mass evacuees can't return home many days weeks could easily turn one many super spreader events. 40% oregon would rather catch fine covid wearing mask. Southern oregon shit sandwich. I’d say 5k first time offenders 10k mandatory fine possible 90 day prison time second offenders.

I wear mask, dumbest thing original comment commented Fauci telling people wear masks thing first hit? Sigh. COVID-19 care rich are. feel like whole climate change thing already answered question Everybody lies. someone lies never believe anything say you’re straight dumbass. Literally never single human history 100% truthful 24/7. Damn Hays county Texas.

Yesterday: 145 

Today: 210

People started tubing rivers Texas heavily like 3 weeks ago. Tubing probably biggest draw time year Hays county. biggest city notorious college party town San Marcos, population 63,509. good actual gymnastics mental gymnastics they'd able suck dicks.

It would actually help community transmission since they'd never leave house Thanks putting discomfort well others. think meritless idiots. think spot on, mistrust authorities. Many think system corrupted core, anyone makes far enough become authority - put front camera's, tainted. mistrust, going make many outright reject told. end badly, especially BLM outrage going on. Expect violence. hypothetical basically identical hundred reasons business might decide refuse service ask someone leave though. actually specific quote specific situation regarding nuanced differences asymptomatic cases pre-symptomatic cases. taken completely context media statement reported incorrectly. clarify misinterpretation result, many people like doubtful information.

According Harvard Global Health Institute: “All best evidence suggests people without symptoms readily spread SARS-CoV-2, virus causes Covid-19. fact, evidence suggests people may infectious days become symptomatic — is, presymptomatic phase feel well, symptoms, may shedding substantial amounts virus.” totally emailing corporate binge. herd immunity % assumes homogenous susceptibility amongst population, there’s research suggesting may bit lower. Herd immunity also isn’t on/off switch—any decrease potential victims makes spread harder. 20% ain’t though, since still new cases. Kick! Punch! mind

Good job, Parappa! move next stage now!
(Ya hoo! Alright!) rural people rushing Trump rallies coming weeks drag back home. reddit regularly get lectured people never done actual scientific experiment lives, mostly left. research chemist... Wait, non-response factual post failed attempt gaslighting?

Gaslight. Obstruct. Project.

Your political affiliation showing. Thanks heads this, though. Simple answer Science sexy. People would rather listen entertaining conspiracy theory recite Scientific Method. Yeah. Churches seem comply lead lot outbreaks. parents. They're risking lives daughter.

Do think complaining change mind? Either risk daughter brings, danger covid.

That's people work all? Great username, great beer style. 
Wish them. Globally human species probably always living it. Even get vaccine reliably provide lifelong immunity difficult distribute every corner world. deal conflict zones, vaccine skepticism, limited resources many poor parts world, remote areas hard reach. trying eradicate polio since 80s, still pockets Pakistan Afghanistan continues paralyze children. human disease eradicated via vaccine smallpox, obvious symptoms could guide vaccination efforts. Demon-Haunted World: Science Candle Dark by Carl Sagan Seatbelt use better example. current law well. took lot people wrapped around trees splattered brains get there. scenario  One leaderless movement nobody could cancel, spontaneous protest reaction terrible event long history police violence. 

The event venue, tickets, organization, liability, ""suggested"" precautions take star event screams taking precautions upset him. 

Both problems time virus, protests rose necessity, Trump rallies rose vanity.

E: Also, ""left"" hypocrites sides opposite opinions... make favor one making sides hypocrites? misguided bias ""the dang libruhls!!"" ?? case, modern religion Science (TM). someone calls denier something, research chemist. People like ones using Science (TM) cudgel politics. superficial level disregard: people know expensive good lock is?! Deaths lag case increases lot. Off-hand average 28 days showing symptoms death. 

Earlier limited testing closed gap along get test (showing multiple symptoms, etc) processing times longer labs backed up. ban 👍🏼 Holy crap, last bit “my ignorance good knowledge” freaked out. 
It puts lot things perspective. Maybe. also really good contact tracing lot areas got case numbers down. many people go NY town definitely able keep track all. Fingers crossed doesn't.  NEED VACCINE  Think it, decently large group people country believe book fairy tales, simultaneously thinking climate change hoax. count truly implausible scientific consensus change? Initially, warned people wear masks people protect getting infected. found masks don’t stop catching it, consensus wear them. new evidence emerged wearing mask help stop spreading it, consensus changed wearing again. Science always evolving, people would fools assume scientists never go back themselves. shows progress willingness accept mistakes. really bad thing? coronaviruses compare to? MERS SARS , related coronaviruses SARS COVID2? shit dumbass.. virus origin thing still air, prevailing opinion originate Wuhan lab, despite juicy possibility sounds. I'm willing change mind better evidence comes out.  
  
As HCQ effectiveness, prevailing opinion evolved scientific trials on-going. single study article posted retracted inconsistencies found. Also, two opposing camps scientists debating effectiveness treatment novel virus insidious ""lying"" way, expected. scientist heavily scrutinizing work opposing scientist, job correctly. goal come truth, push agendas. want indoors store 8+% COVID-positive population, yes, stocking essentials again. think lot comes ego. older get, fall behind education wise, begin resent. resent scientists use methods don’t understand, resent politicians use words don’t understand. Instead acknowledging knowledge gap making choice improve, fester self-hatred think “no, it’s that’s dumb! It’s them! They’re lying! know it. Everyone, listen me! Hah, sheeple. know truth government. I’m smarter you.”

In way, systematically twist fabric reality come top dog. Good I’m sure he’s fine problem people's stupidity means smart enough realize stupid comprehend someone else much smarter wiser. Half country case Dunning-Kruger. Here's said. ""What's misconception? Florida reporting 3,000 covid deaths 5,000 pneumonia deaths. logic accounts 3,000 pneumonia deaths - accounting extra 1,100 pneumonia deaths 5 months Florida last year?""

A) provided evidence numbers.
B) showed article shows misconception specific Reddit. ( Something often happens site spreads like wildfire)

Then showed article excess mortality. done talking pneumonia issue now? seems like going place. guess admitting actually source numbers gave Reddit thread? Remember said china didn’t warn us? obvious lie even true wouldn’t mattered. president governors saw happened nyc still opened prematurely. Whats excuse now? 
Profit lives None serology studies shown anywhere near halfway general populations Yeah second cited article peer reviewed actually seems important me, cuz asymptomatic mildly symptomatic patients lowered levels antibodies 8 weeks. study, interpreted preliminary, still adds pile long term immunity gonna valid hope deal virus Scientists everywhere: ""If re-open early, could serious surge cases.""

Florida: ""We're going re-open economy dont need worry safety measures like masks, social distancing, etc...""

Scientists: ""Florida seeing record numbers infections

Florida: \*surprised pikachu\* ""I think know Free Rock Climbing experts, I'm going climb El Capitan rope. okay, saw YouTube video it.""  Dude dont inderstand real world. understand viewpoint underage kid living parents. different legally responsible you, parents told thier adult offspring fuck lot less putting lives family risk. Brazil k-k-keeping real Lol Definitely coming back days. Curious hear outcome Yeah get choose, that’s totally fine. trying hassle willful ignorance? I’ve long felt shouldn’t get irrationally pick choose science benefit from.

Don’t like vaccines? don’t get antibiotics you’re sick. 

Don’t like 5G? Please hand smartphone. Lets honest, know people think 'low air flow box filled tons people? sounds like good way spend afternoon' also people going wear mask. They're pandering current target audience. mean media Reddit readily slurp fits accepted narrative? statement Fauci's potential conflict interest inherently political, question anyone's motives that's possibility, matter affiliated with, common today media politics.

The movie scientist bit opinion, based ridiculous become, seems like something horribly written movie. don’t though. remain open places go capacity hospitals. Sweden proved this.

The fear definitely problem. Americans don’t seem aware US, steady decline deaths per day since mid April gradually started opening country. wouldn’t know reading news. Good news honest headlines doesn’t sell clicks. See self. Sort controversial sub. see significantly news way won’t see sorting hot people don’t like reason.

Worldwide, Covid-19 deaths even close outnumbering motor vehicle deaths. risk totally different planet measure risk days stolen life. People really hard time calibrating fear appropriate level blame structure media consumed. Also known Evangelism  knew started given demographic area... bad.

Fuck can't kick pebble around without hitting wheelchair, Walker someone multiple underlying health problems. Yes understand 100 year pandemic.

In course saving lives, measures we've taken ALSO caused numerous socioecomonic issues, cannot casually swept rug analyzing whether measures taken were, fact, effective. Never Agreed. I'm sure long case antibodies give immunity, actually means spreading too. showed 20% back April. Unless nobody NY gotten sick since then, really see way higher. There's good chance things really blow gets cancelled. I'd rsvp yes make plans get really ""sick"" around time bow events. Send nice gift/check. Paywall expect pandemic continue herd immunity vaccine, think seeing end social distancing. Bold claim source evidence. Yeah like upon time. reveled could get worst grade. mean did, compared got worst. people children taken seriously. also NEVER put seats power matter small seat. that's funny comic

physics math closer rest Agreed, outside germs get dispersed breeze? I’m aware. dropping lowest level everyone thinks NYC still nexus covid universe. I’m NY state myself... hope get Christmas. However, hunch since starting trial late states, FDA approve early 2021. think countries definitely get us. People object wearing masks, etc., quick tell ‘experts aren’t always right’. experts admit that. However, frequently right amateurs ‘go gut’. Since February, one pizza.   Murder versus disease. Malaria kills one million people year. reason US looking vaccine quickly 120,000 domestic deaths. use argument present, allocating resources toward Malaria rather COVID-19 kills people annually? look forward killed cop ripe age 23, maybe risking COVID-19 seem bad? lot people work future looks pretty grim protesting may way coming terms taking sort control. sub enough know smug everyone is, don’t take college level course science accept don’t know everything follow instructions proper authority subject. seems fantasizing time, indicates narcissism senility. make self-centered insensitive suffering others, explains behavior describe. also fantasizes coronavirus dying doesnt worry catching way. Narcissism fantasy.  Lets honest, anti-science bias that's root cause. Religious Authoritarianism groups promoting anti-modernist, anti-intellectual, heck, *anti-thinking* even.. anti-science part that. want uncritical, obedient gullible sheep, they'll keep believing told, keep tithing church. 

Science simply represents obvious existential threat religion, tolerate it. said - never challenge meaningful debate. either strawman argument personal attack. sure sign really nothing back arguments. 

Thanks proving point. Haha, meant “think averagely intelligent person know”. believe it’s George Carlin quote could wrong. hilarious misquote though. I’ve Aldi, Target, Wal-mart, Whole Foods, Sprinkles Cupcakes, enforced masks. Although I’ve yet see someone challenge that. first things first, ""being dick"".

second, already quite old. given option flee, course refused default.

after drank conium, lied closed eyes waiting death. shortly afterwards, turned one friends told ""do remember, owe ~~zeus~~Asclepius rooster sacrifice."" Deaths lag almost month, whatever people died today divided many cases month ago better measure It’s simulation  know can’t happen... wouldn’t great everyone stay put states while.... whole family also got sick really bad January. cough finally almost gone. mom got antibody test came back negative, worried test right, could risk. don't. family socializes couple families. men oldest kids went rafting last weekend. told straight would fired sociopath president. figured Ventura county fucked opened beaches lot people came it. beach looked like 4th July level. Honestly I’m kind shocked masks nonexistent.

I hope remain low sneaking suspicion Oxnard waiting get hit really hard. Santa Paula’s numbers spiked low long. Based ... ? Facemasks required everywhere soon. can't tell comment edited TIL

I always thought Mulan gonna Disney+ thing. even possible. US something called federalism. Remember trump wanted open churches? power that. States ignored since states that. Trump lot less power people think does.

The fed give guidelines respond requests governors arent really able much else legally. Never really thought pattern mostly living indoors reversed AZ. Interesting. Incorrect reporting not, think USA would screwed anyways. enough historical precedent know reports 'irregular pneumonia' caused novel virus warrants preparation pandemic. Whether china lied not, enough information first week January. cant die viruses arent alive. killing machine keeps replicating stop giving places go. Time leave bro, lifes precious money. company treats u like dirt, theres point working them. Best luck Why? Nobody dumb enough actually go anyplace like that, right? actual evidence support Wuhan ground zero That's nutjobs make sense. comes time microchip track population, people willingly pay cool thing do.  I'm Texas County, OK. Polar opposite side state Tulsa. 

But look numbers. :/

We probably 30k people entire county. I'm saying go far, set tent aux hospital ward area nearby large parking area less sick patients makes sense hospital get overwhelmed ems gets people sick shuttling patients like nyc did. Learn that. Must reporting error. low. Sad thing is, ones know already know ones causing problem serology studies show virus definitely run half course. making posts coronavirus sub poorly informed? Explanations purpose masks (catching droplets spit, pretty obviously accomplished ""flimsy cloth"") hashed literally thousands articles last several months. seems almost impossible avoid awareness even literally tried avoid information. trying dick, honestly fuck? Also, medical condition give reasonable accommodation. varies business, obviously, isnt automatic pass. mild flus stuff months, sadly tested negative antibodies. Like almost quite 0. Exposure symptoms five days average, symptoms hospital 7-10 average. 12-15 days exposure hospital. Ie, two weeks. supports theories virus could around Wuhan earlier previously thought. 18th December virus even came international light.

Seems like virus around weeks maybe even month hits critical mass becomes visible public.  Sorry hear it, symptoms still have? Understatement year Like Redditor said. Employees paid (slightly) expected work efficiently.

If visit target you’ll notice staff power walking rather walking already. trip *anywhere* would dangerous. Also, first round spring break, many may got it, traveled home, making seem like consequences all. Yeah fine I'm sure facemasks? Live L.A every time I’m walking public see nearly everyone wearing masks. don’t think it’s norcal vs SoCal honest. based county. least people stopped showing rashes assuming look skin 😂😂😂 Ooo Joe Rogans gonna flip lmao 7 hour old account Yeah, country full imbeciles.  know thats GOP keep voting relief bills right? sorry father. hope makes through. 

You seem like good person ask question wondering about. oncologists need wear PPE around cancer patients times? 

I'm curious know oncologist taking C19 seriously all, dawned may putting patients risk too. so, want speak up.  Protests generally move well. someone rally, every ~3rd person direction seat also probably contract virus. makes zero sense. None. think people realize long takes things develop... Cases lag EXPOSURE week two. Hospitalizations death couple weeks that.   SARS1 MERS eradicated deliberate international government policy. 


SARS1 mortality rate 20%, MERS 34% - neither burned killing people. initial guess 4th shit would hitting fan memorial day stupidity. wrong, way sooner that. still 16 days till then. Where’s covid hospital ship Cuomo didn’t need? Can’t pull fucker there? straight lot common colds actual coronaviruses. nobody responds mentally ill homeless people masturbating subway reason That's reality. rings true virus may began China. could started United States Philippines even Italy. whole timeline events window. Maybe started Vietnam became hotspot China first. Oh here's one! admire commitment never use /s tag, damn.  would ask ventilation systems. long cunt Joe Rogan catches it? Maybe government officials objectively lie saying things like masks work people might trust more? like complaint politicization science within lines turn around politicize one top medical scientists nation. others too. Anything pertains credit record, delayed payments included. can't afford bill work 1-3 months, they're going take account measure risk them. I'm dining while, either. Two weeks long takes exposure hospitalisation. outright conspiracy theory probably taken consideration, think China probably first ASSUME WITHOUT EVIDENCE they're probably using concentration camps infect prisoners use test subjects many potential vaccines. way condemning accusation Chinese people, put past shit, asshole leader. recall anyone thinking fine; everyone called bullshit loudly vocally. understand big, century, deal right? measures we’ve taken vastly prevented would’ve happened not. incredible see. defining moment Trumps legacy plays think will. Fucking lol right left Explanation: states like Sao Paulo Rio de Janeiro problems registering new cases past 2 days. system went back today reported huge amount accumulated cases Meanwhile can't even hit 60k tests week do, counting antibody tests. hate here. Getting plane coronavirus without mask like making death threats everyone else plane. Brandon Straka try going NYC grocery store without mask. shoppers ""educate"" quickly.

In response fiction8 said, ""I never able fathom depths people's stupidity "", surprise left soon got words ""ardent supporter President Trump"".   seeing crowds people claiming ""God-given rights"" go without masks (who seem forget God made coronavirus, too), BLM marchers think they're going win support blocking freeways, seeing confirmation research says human race getting stupider. (True: )

Apparently, Darwinism working fast enough. One million U.S. cases June 1st 2 million June 15, people think need masks anymore?

Statistics today (6/19/2020) show 31,011 deaths, **69,243** recovered New York U.S.  - 31% NY cases DIED, wants leave New York plane see Planet Apes #6 now: Doctor Zaius saying, ""Remember friends, wearing masks began downfall humans."" Unfortunately, coronavirus immunity often lasts months. lifelong.

 

That, coupled organ damage virus inflict body, means intentionally getting infected good strategy. mutates randomly time. strains lead severe symptoms tend spread far hosts stuck home dying. strains lead less severe symptoms spread hosts less aware inhibited. average people likely get infected less severe strains time. clear extent happened virus though. wonder they're talking area something, Bogotá biggest one area population. Cali seem second biggest city area, Medellín still people, I'm little confused. think full Karen rally Brazil. Ooohh. husbands trump rally.. 2 birds one corona. theoretically exempt, severe asthma fit struggling untie mask suffocate it.

But wear I'm fucking asshole. remove medicate myself/move outdoors away people.

Reasons public pandemic matter livelihood line. Many people chronic conditions also can't go work pay others weekly grocery shop.

Which I'm fucking mad mask politicization. everyone wore one, I'd much safer. ~half town, I'm far risk compromising oxygen intake keep everyone safer, including maskless put higher risk.

I get it. Criminal negligence position Fauci thought available masks go doctors &amp; nurses fighting save people's lives rather Karen wanted get haircut, can't trust him? implemented measures managed flatten curve

How explain explosive growth recent weeks outside capital?

The curve never really flattened. simply hidden extremely limited testing.

One indication crude case/fatality ratio. Right world's crude CFR 5.3%, Sweden's 9%. disease deadly Sweden, total number cases artificially low due testing criteria used. crude CFR suggests Sweden least twice many cases numbers suggest.

To show mean, compiled table total reported cases deaths report, used crude CFR 5% estimate number deaths reported cases, number cases reported deaths.

[This chart see, use CFR 5% estimate number deaths reported number cases, total number deaths would much lower. use CFR estimate number cases reported number deaths, total number cases would much higher.

Either Sweden extremely high CFR (well average), Sweden drastically under-reporting number cases.

But consider numerous studies — using range methods — estimate many countries 5 10 people die every 1,000 people COVID-19. “The studies faith tending converge around 0.5–1%,” says chart estimated cases calculated reported deaths based IFR look that, wonder Swedish government saying ""herd immunity"" would reached quickly. simple extrapolation number deaths suggests actually half million cases, assuming IFR around 1%.

Edit: put perspective, estimating cases based IFR 1%, Finland would 32,600 cases instead reported 7,133 Norway would 24,400 cases instead reported 8,721. worry, mistakes happen actually owning rare. yes threads particular really bad. be, like casinos. mandating table games players wear mask, slots players people still vaping/smoking like crazy bringing/ spreading virus. Temperature checks work already feverish, tired/ weak go/ gamble anyway. WTF works people participate. Great countries make non optional. know said, matter group causes spike cases? everyone's life worth same? book cruises months years ahead time.

So mix people booked COVID-19 even known, people booked known hopes getting cheap cruise. Sorry hear grandpa :( yeah we're pretty much screwed. thought full lockdown Santiago would help us reduce daily cases seems everyday month already. idea plan control considering people going work seems Piñera 0 intention helping people money actually stay home. hope effective treatment vaccine comes soon else know going get without people dying :( submission removed because

So far, consequences places “mask requirements” scary  get fined less parking overnight? Wow, they're shaking boots Ok listen me. China go fuck far concerned.

And Chinese Chinese bots : downvote button 👇. activist, example activism, ignorance. Also vast majority protesters wearing masks.

The counter protesters hand....... Saw comment Facebook today guy trying spin ""there 21mil+ people 89k cases means that's .4% infection rate stop overreacting garbage"" lot people FL give shit see everyday. mask money mine spend Fuck off, hoaxer.

Lose - lose them. Regardless, go. worth it. areas mask policies, Asheville example, aren’t legal financial repercussions

So even though it’s “requirement” consequences result lot people walking around without masks  Anybody else notice spikes predominantly occurring ""red"" states? Hmmm... wonder why.

Turns protesting extrajudicial murder something people willing die over. least helpful general population. I'm really sure ask this, I'll take chance post here.

First, background. 

I'm immune compromised due medication. family members suggested go there's covid vaccine, really option month so, can't really breath. I'm also type 2 diabetic, aggressively managing it.

In March, put sign server room work requesting people come without mask. caused zoom meeting told requiring masks unreasonable, something expect walked back shortly, since live California. allowed modify asking people use electronic communication whenever possible. HR aware I'm immune compromised.

Basically, work alone, there's shift overlap approximately 15 minutes. guy relieved today never wears mask. Today came in, repeatedly got close me, hung entire 15 minutes commented leaving kids coughs, doubts Covid. cruel joke, ""Oh yeah...""

Now I'm stressing hard. washed hands course. person regularly wears mask. wiped could, he's apparently 10 hours, coughing. manager's response ""I'll talk him.""

The question ""What now?"" suggestions minimizing risk? Obviously, plan ask doctor morning. guy stares fingers. Yes ? remember thousands toxic people protesting without caring infecting people. They're still it. 

Textbook worthless people. Wear mask, crush enemies, see driven you, hear lamentations women! Goddamn, love Reddit. one idols pop 39 upvotes.

Fight good fight, gotta normalize masks make manly again.

MMMA.... make masks manly I'm pretty sure health experts said things. think can't asked? conspiracy want true?  Yet people see wearing facemasks public constantly fiddling hands, touching face. Completely defeats purpose. Dumb. Omg read voice fixed it. Big fail part. Sorry significant disconnect science average Joe think is. exacerbated fact science educational systems depicted something magical comes sky. Real science nothing search knowledge scientific method. one focuses actual discovery knowledge, instead aimlessly feed students random factoids whatever topic day. 

When combine depiction ""institutionalised"" science implicit biases fear government people rampant inequality poverty, end **explicit** anti-science bias. matter lives literally depend scientists making constant progress, bias talks scientists part Soros cabal science becomes another talking meaningless point. know it. downvote anything making look bad 
Can *really* blame average person little skeptical “expert” opinion? public pronouncements coronavirus parade errors hysterical headlines.

Human-to-human transmission impossible wasn’t. Notwithstanding every indication contrary.

Coronavirus posed trivial risk US March, (despite countless non-stop flights Wuhan since outbreak). 

Wearing masks helpful *not* wearing one made literally Pol Pot.

Neil Ferguson’s “analysis” predicted *1.2 million* Americans would die even lockdowns enhanced social distancing. “expert” predicted 200 million deaths avian flu.

We told Sweden would wasteland overrun hospitals mass death. criticize handling nursing homes (~60% mortality) hospitals *not* overrun despite refusal lockdown country. Comparing imperial college predictions actual mortality today really really funny exercise. predictions prove inaccurate, naturally undermine public trust

In general, experts done great job undermining faith views. Even without anyone’s “anti-science bias” San Diego resident. Gyms recently opened back *maybe* 1 every 20 people gym wearing mask LA Fitness go to. There's sign outside noting new gym rules include 'wearing mask times inside'; nobody paying attention enforced. work hotels, state that's handling covid-19 well. many reservations right ones Arizona Florida make us nervous.

NBA MLS enter bubble... get that...what im seeing people start slow, right? complacency kicks back normal living time - whether people incoporate masks new normal regiment still incorportate things lockdown going grab bag chaos.....

I dont know man....i dont like it. Covid19 deaths, though. higher number infected people, struggle long term effekt illness. Rehabilitation hospitalized covid19 patient may take least half year om many cases. Lots og people never return normal life. tragedy om personal level, also hard toll country whole. wait, get worse.

 I'm sure I'm missing. 

The coaches ones risk. Many older, health problems. players mostly healthy, 100%. players diabetes, hypertension, asthma, obese. mean pretend risk players whatsoever, wishful thinking.

Death also downside. serious damage person's lungs. athlete critically important. player getting sick put two weeks minimum. Recovery could even longer moderate severe cases.

So whenever see douchenozzle comment this. realize care. want sports back. players' health damned. take one completely unnecessary preventable death season cancelled. considering many involved definitely possible. Doesn’t help nutcases Southern California like Peggy Hall Leigh Dundas sending death threats public official putting mask orders. It’s gotten point they’re going schools even suggest kind safety precautions upcoming school year. I'l mistaken that's (grim) new record, right? Shut everything down.

Science eat. pays bills. respect, admire, bullshit scientists. constantly trying reel antivaxers like talking them, usually much success. Still, lot times people seem conflate bad science causative factors true. 

For example, years people switched fat-free low-fat foods bad science time told right thing do. Butter, horrible natural fat , substituted much healthier trans fat margarine *because science*. Obesity skyrocketed course, we've moved past that. top this, look bad health science, breakfast important meal day (funded Kelloggs course) examples. 

Science important, blindly following ""research shows...."" ""experts say"" sense often used get things buy stuff probably need. Follow good science. Bad science exists people immune corruption. Multiple, repeated studies peer reviewed replicated need following. frowning ask anything. mean mention backing claims, would love see back everything claimed animals caught far (dogs cats) shown capable transmitting people. 

Does include animals eat? imagine things like chickens, pigs cows might larger threat. Also sure could spread among wildlife eventually coming back something humans hunt. Anyone hear talks reversing opening up? Maybe mandated masks? feel like GA still something react.

Ok. cases detected? random employee testing strip? 

Or people tested independently developing symptoms? Masks reduce chances getting infected. people wearing masks nearly eliminates chances catching catching droplets expel. Wearing mask limited help unless everyone wears one. still eyes. 

This CDC saying ""Only high risk people need masks."" help enough stop damned thing. Everyone needs wear mask. keep germs, I'll keep mine. can't stay home sick, understand this, important wear mask wash hands. Let stop you. Three cases coronavirus confirmed areas outside Beijing, fears virus may spread frozen food.

A total 158 cases reported across city since new cluster infections linked sprawling Xinfadi wholesale market detected last week.

Twenty-one cases confirmed Thursday, another neighbouring city Tianjin two Hebei province surrounds Beijing.

The case Tianjin involves 22-year-old man works city's Conrad Hotel washing dishes occasionally cleaning frozen seafood, China’s Global Times reported.

He travelled prior developing symptoms known contact suspected cases, leading experts suspect may picked disease touching contaminated food.

He could infected handling food even ice used freeze it, Yang Zhanqiu, virologist Wuhan University, told outlet.

""For example, -20C -30C environment, virus could live months even years,"" said.

""The frozen seafood touched Tianjin patient could batch shipped Beijing Xinfadi.”

Mr Yang told paper people avoid eating raw food cautious consuming processed frozen food. still pay rent/mortgages real financing relief money ran out. Money ran rich still getting richer taxed something. 

Stuck rock hard place without system like Denmark had, businesses try open survive.

Since rent simply due end embargo, businesses able make lump sum. Expect massive bankruptcies eviction moratoriums run out. there's extensive research funding support favorable conclusions big corporations &amp; governments involved decades (take food pyramid safe tobacco least controversial examples), well ideological support academia certain research absolute opposition whatever fall line agenda may threat funding (say psychedelics least controversial example). legally can’t stop citizens coming home. mean feel completely fine right - sickness currently. fever. died, die knowing fought protested great cause. I'm content think point things consider. know deliberate fabrication changing mind got different information. What's wrong changing mind get different convincing information? see good thing. 


Now, let's consider lie. people lie? Generally, (or organization serving derives benefit). Okay, let's suppose mask protection scenario goes like this: 


What remember experts saying back March things like masks effective (true), 100% effective (true), protect wearer (true) need save masks first responders (true). So, really worthwhile get/wear mask (interpretation many people still holding to).

&amp;#x200B;

So, entities see Dr. Fauci protecting first responders, shortage masks.  

&amp;#x200B;

should kept consistent story? Actually, point, think have, let's jump time machine go back March stores stripped supplies surprising thing complete utter lack toilet paper seeing near complete return pre-panic buy toilet paper stock stores--three months later. So, completely understand visible medical experts discouraging group people proven panicked frightened pandemic. know area, people getting violent mine, toilet paper truly surprised violence erupted masks restrictions lifted. important save masks first responders. Especially since people United States supposedly sheltering place anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, Americans started get outside moving again, advice shifted. told similar things, really. Masks 100% effective (still true). protect others wearer (still true), everyone wears them, protect (true, different emphasis time around). 

&amp;#x200B;

So, yes. could done better job, look talking behaved really changed, either. countries 32 cases would considered good news, China would single digit Well, celebrities know best! somebody able get TV movies means give opinions utmost consideration! people those?
At BLM protests I've to, almost everyone wearing masks. 
Or talking protests anti-SIP? wearing masks. Yeah, long density people low - everyone stay 6 ft apart type thing. Safer sunny somewhat windy. 

You increase density somewhat there's absolutely reason keep people cohabitate 6 feet apart. served maybe 10 people 350 today masks. much chance getting corona day day flu. Less actually new measures. Thanks these. guess happened one guy. Maybe got China strain European strain. I’d love see follow up. Hey Arnold! wanna let know you’re fuckin man. Thanks exemplary person! Eh, fuckin give rest already. Everythings getting back normal, theres fucking mass riots protests, yet cases arent shooting up. people actually believe bullshit point reddits Chinese Russian paid shills, politicians. political, whole fucking thing political, anyone doesnt think political issue lying isnt payin attention. Thats everywhere. dont want know many men women sleeping floor dirty overpopulated ans understaffed jails minor charges. Yeah, west philly pretty much every time I’m store everyone mask on. moved something obviously issue everyone making effort here. Makes sense see likelihood someone store could infected compared counties. brother massive fans you!!! 

I can't believe Reddit too! Thank much voice reason chaotic time

Could say terminator line reply? 

Thank much Reminder May 22nd US CDC Canadian equivelent pegged infected fatality rate COVID-19 .2% .3%

This 1,200% lower 3.4% prediction early March used justify locking everything down.

In 2018 US 80,000 flue deaths IFR rate .2% pretty close US Canadian IFR .2% - .3% COVID.

We basically destroyed world's economy, impact 250 Million, mostly people color, risk starvation, virus similar bad 2018 flu season. Mob mentality isn’t always wrong, fuck stick. Sometimes mob very, correct. joke based social distancing...nevermind... stop immediate problem, stops future ones. Seems many exceptions especially religious exception. see everyone claiming religious exemption wearing mask itz 'Murica mi rites?? 1?? Yup Houstons goes effect Monday. needed like month ago. start. seems lots exceptions though; hope rest Phoenix valley (i.e. Scottsdale, Chandler, Tempe, Mesa, etc) follow suit. Yeah it’s almost like *a novel virus* causing economic hardship whether enforce social distancing not. Weird. Hello? Hello? still there?0.o


...he hung It’s hard qualify “giving up” conscious course action, get you’re saying. used friends dumbass who's posting fake info get wearing mask work, claims asthma prevents breathing properly wearing one.

Asthma stop smoking pack+ day around 1/4 oz cannabis week past 10 years. countries using app based system enable contact tracing. google it. It’s sort big deal first fifth amendment standpoint. 

Thankfully never worry AIDS also, really stop trying insult me. makes look bad. civil conversation. decided go crude. 

Good day asthmatics struggle breathe normally emailed principal committees. anything allowing anyone take initiative. still waiting state people talk say state’s plan purposefully vague generic anything happens it’s local school boards. waiting school go first could possibility. Also, don’t know regular office work is, schools, even powerful important committees almost power one listens them. Well, Fauci lied us politics.  result.  highly dishonest surprised trust say admitted intentionally lied us. Science needs take precedence politics! positive hit rate close 50%....that's insane. Jesus, must one god damn sever case pneumonia 

I got pneumonia kid besides week spent hospital, I’ve never happen. Yep. Exactly like that.

How get 600,000 cases flattened curve 150,000 cases?

On April 18, Anders Tegnell said curve flattened. Based IFR 1% would total around 150,000 cases day. we're told number cases must least quadrupled since then.

The thing ""flattened"" reported numbers cases per day, ""flattened"" changed testing criteria exclude cases. New cases positivity rates trending wrong direction, even testing capacity remains flat. Fewer people likely die due better treatments, long-term health effects (including ""asymptomatic"" carriers) still unknown. is, simply put, disaster that's completely preventable. DeSantis's comments imply herd immunity strategy GOP policymakers adopting here. extremely dangerous know long-term health effects COVID-19 could be, even among younger people.

Heck, even know type disease COVID-19 (is respiratory? attack vascular systems multiple organs, including integument evidence suggesting?). virus worth gamble. keep case counts low work towards vaccine. April.... appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* idiot unintentionally helped AA marketing. AA looks responsible people might opt go them, despite problems have, since follow mask policy. problem country picked 2 sides. one side oppose EVERY issue. consensus anything - even medical facts like wearing masks distancing. That’s....not true Well, work well nobody uses masks around so, yes, think needs law, yes, police enforce it. Public safety, getting driver license, different. people werent idiots would know infection count really mean much. hospitalization rates need look for. since testing ramped across world seeing cases actually decrease overall bospitaliza rates. 20% = majority?

Do count ballots, well? mediate conflict patient want treated (offensive word) patient survived. doctor shoot choke anyone. Amazing go sorts situations without murdering people, right?

And person waving weapon around? reason suspect weapon planning using it? anyone else feel like lives anyone else's lives immediate, extreme danger? There's lot law enforcement simply shooting people. every case argument, vast majority cops murdered less people, protesting. Literally millions people manage murder others. people, fact, go full lives without murdering single person.

Well, amount people killed police declining last years. graphic representation Statista (and media bias report back site's credibility, case that's question) even separates race, think neat feature. wish statistic explained generic situations each, crime related, think complicated situation spend less time judging people trying navigate competing moral dilemmas

I time asking cops shooting suspects back, choking death they're handcuffs, severing spinal cord way police station.

That's inexcusable behavior, cases make whole pie. protestors started looting, make every protestor looter? simple logic follow, one obvious answer. Would protestors began looting act different bad police armed like police? Likely not. argument goes want protests end, easiest thing ask police literally everyone else manages every day go work.

But enough. already charged one cop, enough - charge all. Okay, that, enough, fire police chief, dissolve department. They're tearing Washington Jefferson statues predicted before, firmly believe Washington Monument Lincoln Memorial next. line drawn?

Here's thing: people change. someone made racist Tweet ten years ago mean still think way, certainly completely discredit everything they've accomplished. example, Abraham Lincoln. man racist. However, instated Emancipation Proclamation. what, gave free pass racist? complex issue sadly never solved. black president change that, doubt anything will. Came article, stayed cartoons.

25k US deaths three weeks seems low side, 10k per week everything opened up? Wwe supposed bubble Florida, people getting sick/ infected there. Well that’s delving awful lot unknowns. 

Nothing say wrong don’t really know. 10-20% severe hyperbole measure thus far. 

And flip side point don’t vaccine 5 years? never? early rushed vaccines serious side effects?

Just playing devils advocate. lean towards side waiting vaccine also can’t deny reality even initial vaccines going take long time unknown efficacy. Oh yeah that. Fuck life.

Tbh tho Europe full continent. EU smaller ""wet streets cause rain"" ridiculous. wear mask keep others safe. signal distaste Trump flipping motorcade. I'm AZ, frustrating people learn happened elsewhere. plenty warnings, definitely need way. Sorry meant number cases today folks social media convinced conditions US getting worse. “Worse,” think, would rising deaths rather significantly falling deaths (declining rate 20% week week). 

And folks regurgitating “deaths lagging indicator” don’t account fact previously higher % positive numbers higher case numbers much less testing (meaning likely people infected compared ones infected, didn’t know). Deaths fallen two months. saw big case numbers back believe would’ve either seen deaths plateau rise last ~10 weeks going see deaths start rise again. Seeing iceberg doesn’t necessarily mean it’s gotten significantly bigger. 

Caveat: I’m concerned rising % positive number. we’ll watch closely. honestly believe, I'm cynical person be, won't. People willing forgive look past lot shit. Much harder 3 family members die directly related politicians stupidity. watch soooo many people touch mask , put wrong .. it’s pathetic Conservative activist = attention whore. viscerally appalling. also lockstep administration's agenda.

The Texas governor, Greg Abbot, knows full well state keep paying unemployment workers whose jobs reopened. believe they're looking wrong numbers short sighted lens that. talking damn tracker app. Made seem like believed needed download something government watch you. 

And using zombie bite comparison clearly seem like you’d rather privacy let others know might infected, might spread others. 

Which really shitty. want real world example? 

Say found aids, you’re type would bareback someone without telling aids. Or, say sex someone bareback, told AFTERWARDS, aids...

Are either examples better? Ive watched videos many people arent many wearing incorrectly. Im immune compromised im going protest pandemic.... Americans ignoring authority, probably Fauci others intentionally lied us months ago.  herd immunity work like this. Israel contemplating forced herd immunity plan voluntarily infecting 30, hoping would stave spread elderly population. epidemiologists said virus would continue enough aged demographic infected. can't pick &amp; choose 60 70% populace want exposed. course, everyone knows Butterscotch Cabbagepatch. Email/call representatives  know else impact? Expanded testing capacity people aren’t hospitalized also tested. correct? US twice cases Brazil. Worldwide Brazil roughly 1/8 cases. US roughly twice that.
 Rounding worldwide 8 million, Brazil 1mullion US 2 million.

How’d turn out?

This fight going thousands years. Smart vs strong. 

It’s time end it. Strong dumb needs GO. u/summariser_bot Masks political statements /s play, change schools. nothing racist everything false equivalence. 

If truly think George Washington, general revolutionary war, Arnold Schwarzenegger, actor governor, one same, need re-evaluate logic. Guess set record today Cool cool cool funny Abbott said exact thing. Blame everyone bs! High Schools Universities closed statewide, sole decision Public Health Agency close preschools nationally.           
When Europe closing school, Sweden claimed useleses. reduce spread (sic) also could [""negative effects.""](http://www.tellerreport.com/news/2020-03-12---therefore--schools-in-sweden-are-not-closed-.B1rgZCDHL.html)            
When schools closed own, back March, Public Health Agency actively [discouraged       
According chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, there's big difference Sweden example Italy, [""the virus yet spreading within community here. (how insightful... community spread? Let's nothing worst. /s)

Don't blame decentralization Health Agency's mistakes judgement.  Good news. long vent mind asking? Mob Mentality? Like times Muslims brown people kicked aircraft presence scared passengers? Hmmmmmm...... don’t know others think case, area lot people starting quit rules they’re getting understandably tired. stay strong everyone keep following rules. thought put there, know people disagree, remember one day covid distant memory. together. stay safe. Cant fix stupid.. keep distance much possible. many tests process one day?

How high number get? Yep. know, I'm saying states hiding things, even 100% are. know incentive look bad. top that, one state successfully hiding/manipulating data decent chunk time. means 100% possible, maybe likely, possible states/companies same, especially they're threatening employees losing job, and/or blacklisting them, great economic time.

Just worries could done again, still happening. Especially reluctance I've seen state politicians close up, actively much anything would risk economy. Even state, everyone praises one better (reality is, said nice stuff, that's really it) ones opened beaches tourist areas zero reason, yet cases go anywhere despite precautions taken.

I know, hope something that's happening places without knowledge, find out, it'll late, we've seen examples.

I even mentioned people really assume one time thing, happened once, likely coincidence. said, never said 100%, possible, worried me. Everyone said ""It's happening anywhere else, we'd know, fine"". Whelp, least know there's way telling, unless get oversight, someone risks job/career speaks up. hoping that's case.

Edit: One thing, falsifying data fucking terrible, people's lives stake. said, hardly close worst actions/decisions I've seen done virus outbreak. Even ""worse"" actions, see people getting trouble. might missed it, see reports anyone involved Florida data get trouble either, private companies, politicians (whoever actually responsible, one, other, both, said, could missed it, always possible). clear indication nothing really happen, maybe one fall-guy take blame, without repercussions, becomes ""why this"" scenario head, there's accountability consequences. Whats shit kicking Gates said words aim use vaccines reducing population verbatim front live audience Ted talk, Melinda parroted ideas media interviews conducted outlets directly provided funding — major journalistic conflict interest itself, yet drop bucket measured full scope foundation infiltrated markets interest so-called “global health.”

As firmly sketchballs stand idea mass vaccination lowering desire people children, literally nothing scientific idea whatsoever — it’s bullshit cooked sounds reasonable say without scientific evidence support, public eats Gates’ sure rich squeaky clean (paid-for) public image, must benevolent end day.

Gates technocrat eugenicist, overall interest establishing people greatest possible degree control society human population, understands best way accomplish agenda free scrutiny appear give public want, namely money.

This isn’t say he’s top dog man tip pyramid, he’s one among many spearheading inter-generational effort centralize control society greatest possible extent, use technology, mass media, money laundering bogus philanthropy infiltration public institutions.

This exactly operated chairman Microsoft, it’s open history isn’t kind secret conspiracy theory Gates always unscrupulous scumbag.

If anything, COVID numbers exaggerated dramatic effect, hospitals lowering threshold counts COVID death receive government funding, fact folks industry I’ve spoken personally attested to.

Not sure you’re exactly, live US unemployment never high previous point history, vast majority unemployed likely elderly immuno-compromised, they’re quite well without means provide despite trade markets seem doing.

Not mention, stimulus money went corporations “too big fail”, bogus 2008 bailouts.

Stuff corrupt fuck, there’s nothing good whatsoever super rich monopolizing global health, nothing said justify it’s completely wrong fundamental level.

I highly recommend checking James Corbett’s recent documentaries topics, since you’re interested I’m relatively dumb issues since exposing isn’t life’s work.

Dude respected independent journalist, work available free YouTube (for now) also directly website, listener-supported independent media 100% free share however see fit. Batman would dawg. unpopular 2-3 years accepted answer. Flatten curve keep around 1 R0. pretty much hit R0 time lockdowns started DUE lockdowns itself. fear right understanding we're increasing infections something like 6% rate day per day there's 45% reduction deaths. would think death rate infection rate would largely remain static. example, average time positive test death 8 days 6% increase infections would lead 6% increase deaths 8 days later. seem midst increase seem double digits daily like we're coming week massive reductions infections. 

That's uneducated brain telling I'm guessing may understanding either virus works modeling works. Something like [Summer Safe would probably work. im inclined think same.  even happen... ""world series"" would meh source? Take look NYC’s number today tell impact protests 15-21 days ago. brainwashed cultist extremist prejudiced bigot. know word privilege means, accuse racism even though racism ""mixed race"" marriage ""mixed race"" children, living among races peacefully Canada do. also know logic means, make many logical errors speak, fool.

You're brainwashed shit guy, absolutely brainwashed fucking shit. matter? Wear masks, save lives. cares court thinks? FFS USA, stop fucking around what's sensible. work? know, make things worse? No. wear things FFS. Spain. Yeah, someone else pointed me. Mea culpa. long week. dealing public, question always want ask is, ""So, long like this?"" topic? Maybe secretly? teacher multiple important committees haven’t gotten much single email plan parent teacher. favor, wear mask. Keep professional keep talking good tenant are. may bring rent offer sort ""2 months free"" something like lower costs year well. 

I deal large corporation complex, makes easier negotiate feel. 

All know is, everyone negotiating right now. Say sike think he's also saying ""Hey [Conservative Blogs talk shows], what's up"" evidence, investigations ongoing. China refusing provide info, satelite images show doubling hospital traffic October 2019. really puts different perspective issue.

My neighbors across bridge subverted. like plateaued. feel reopenongs happening, go back eventually, Brazil average ablut 50,000 new cases per day. Wear mask. Key West back tourism normal. Yes, need wear mask, bars restaurants adhering capacity limits. Tourists think virus exist here. Zero social distancing. top off, three counties north bars closed absolutely slammed residents. Residents coming party cases live spiking much, local government keeping bars closed! really drive home point.

Our cases spiking well, since reopened tourism June 1. I'm saying closed there's vaccine, can't act like January 2020 again. 

We still can't get tests. medical condition prevents wearing mask.  bullshit talking about? thats issue exponential problems... fine sudden not. said true long areas actually taking steps mitigate spread ways many places not. High school graduations, sorority fraternity parties, Bar goers clubbing. 
Young feel invincible might get mild symptoms. 

But lot eventually spread someone get bad.

I’m surprised see many people like Paradise Valley don’t wear masks I’ve heard many say don’t even think virus real think it’s political thing. wonder Arizona Texas Florida kind stay home order due spike infection rates. could wrong didn’t NYC spike once. recall 6 week massive case increase hospital surge?

A quick rundown: cellular ATP may play crucial role immune system different individuals respond covid.

Cellar depletion ATP ""bad"". Repletion may significantly beneficial effect.

From light considerations, c-ATP level potentially considered crucial component infectivity prognosis COVID-19. enhancing c-ATP, improvement innate adaptive immune systems hypothesis provides new concept improve immune system COVID-19. demonstrates increase c-ATP decrease effect COVID-19 immune dysregulation. Considering strategies enhance cellular ATP, improvement immune system COVID-19 possible. hoped hypothesis serve stimulus investigation issue.

Creatine well known supplement boost ATP. Might worth look? tested 26 million people date. fact testing people daily. Assuming accurate number, would impressively low death rate. Even that's 50k excess deaths 50k people dead, many hurt losing loved one. many hundreds thousands sick weeks? many still aching, damaged lungs? Essential workers fearing health, medical professionals watching hundreds die. know longterm effects virus spreading uncontrolled. 

Have compassion. Literally one Florida saying this. enforced? That’s escalation could lead higher security event. Turn mildly annoying passenger belligerent possibly violent aggressor feds get involved. ""assumption"" fact. Trump cult's gaslighting issue what's getting old.

""237% residents tested negative!""  Thought said conservation activist. Thought wearing masks due environmental impact. Doesn’t really matter one is.. people playing fear younger people getting virus? 

Because salacious  accurate death rates going countries unaccounted excess deaths tested extremely thoroughly. South Korea Germany good examples. 2.3-4.7% would probably range sits in. 0.6% numbers speculation. Nearly 100 percent? photos saw definitely less that.  specifically OP talking about, article discuss median age decreased significantly within florida:
[Gov. DeSantis: Median age Florida COVID-19 patients  Yep - virus really eat, inject cell, disrupt cell's machinery (which includes taking bits power cell), use materials (food) machinery make copies itself.

Then thousands new copies virus burst cell, Alien style, cell dead. probably number 3.this virus seems kill people rather slowly. getting new hospitalization data AZDHS website keeping updated? example, lists 3 new hospitalizations June 17, clearly farcical. calculating it? Imagine naive type think accurate clever. I'm military. Sometimes divisional officers fail case. would racist do. established, mass gatherings they're outdoors everyone wears masks.  Cool. mean, better sorting glass. actual leadership right would put fly list. political issue even though Orange God thinks is. People dying. Get yourself. norm. state government hands-off, downsides occasional upside entails. time downsides extreme. Ya that’s withheld information 6 days CCP told them. 

Go look instead demanding people link sources easily find. Stay safe dude. what's best family. know this? events crowds packed together rivaled Coachella. wearing masks time / properly. massive outbreak it’s not. don’t want unnecessary deaths, know can’t prevent deaths.

It's coming two sides, though. preventing deaths encourage people start getting together adding ""and worry get sick, there's bed waiting you!"" Exactly. Testing remained consistent even decreased points. cases keep rising everyday. hits 4K 5K what’s blame going yeah, that's kinda increased testing does... Chain command rules change peace vs war, welcome military health minister better previous ones.  LAX couple weeks ago TSA screaming anyone wearing masks. love scream people LAX. Honk honk. definitely increase basic checkups routine monitoring. I’m hard pressed find parts medicine truly done telemedicine. Psychiatry, sure. 

But pretty much procedure, diagnostic imaging test lab visit going require waiting room

Pretty much every surgeon need examine person surgery.

OBs need see person. 

Pediatricians need evaluate kids person even routine visits. AKA: DOS SEMANAS, LIANG GE XINGQA, ZWEI WOCHEN!!!!

You guys get matching t-shirts made this. LAX couple weeks ago TSA screaming anyone wearing masks. love scream people LAX.  CDC end happening. filled people like look data try come best guess happen.

The camp sees IFR 1% calculate based numbers have, New York. calculate based symptomatic people ones die.

Because US late testing, testing prior May 1 primarily symptomatic. everyone counted positive test symptomatic, death rate 8%. actually higher count positives known 14 days death count (that’s length time onset death).

Now gets tricky. know percentage asymptomatic, therefore die COVID-19, is.

The IFR requires cases included. data, like Diamond Princess US Theodor Roosevelt show 50% total be. Asymptomatic. New York testing showed 12 19 percent antibodies May 1 would make 10 fold increase number actual cases reported.

So look IFR New York based 19% COVID, IFR would 23,450 suspected deaths /1.6 million suspected infected equals IFR 1.4%.

But...if 19% incorrect 50/50 would calculate like this.

We know 13,156 confirmed deaths know 166,883 confirmed cases. every one confirmed cases eligible succumb COVID-19, get IFR 8% based data assumption. 

If assume 50/50 would total 2 x 166,883 = 333,776 13,156 confirmed died. gives IFR based infected 3.9% 8% symptomatic.

But seen also calculate IFR based deaths population. NY population 8.6 million chance dying 0.15%. number applicable May 1, May 1 continued deaths.

The best case number dead 1.4% dead test positive. looking 70% needed heard immunity, time [Mayo would likely see:

10,600,000 * 70% = 7,400,000 infected. 7,400.000 * 1.4% death rate = 103,000 dead likely best outcome NY 19% infected time deaths. 1.3% IFR death rate calculated Diamond Princess well.

So somewhere 103,000 175,000 lies true number. making decisions whereby others pay price, cannot assume best case it’ could potentially factor 10 fold. Unless really don’t give shit die.

This much give you. Dude, used article quoted burden proof masks work turn around say science? First recognize article perspective piece link studies mask use. even read article linked saw headline? policy change (more stringent before) went effect days ago AA regional carriers.

Like need wheelchair required explain exactly need wheelchair? I'm sure think part gets us ""I need service rattlesnake me."" crap. Oh that's painfully accurate see people sub joke that, don’t see anyone ever post link data number tests given. I’d love see historical data set tests given. would glad crunch numbers myself. ignorant current events? outbreak SARS right now. SARS-1 occured 2002-2003, SARS-2 ongoing since 2019. Mayor police chief realistically tell people go practically ringleaders (esp Acevedo) protests? Yes, sometimes stupid moves yield surprise benefits. seems fact elderly dying everywhere become benefit struggling economies supporting them. Two biggest asshole governors fucked country ours. Abbott also forceing schools open person schedule mask requirements mandatory symptoms check required social distancing. Rabies joke. guys don’t get sarcasm all.

It really one first places checked. Also, didn’t strike weird scientists trying make antibodies derived cow blood work within human immune system? 

How’d cow get antibodies? 

By way - data evidence. head/face, tight neck, would effective also. Sore throat, lesser taste smell, fatigue, blurry vision, low energy, joint nerve pain. Last fever 14 days ago. Last cough 64 days ago. general populace lacks fundamental understanding science. Chemistry isn’t required high school course state yet country leading nuclear superpower. end president can’t even pronounce word nuclear. PSA Nucular fucking word. Nurses doctors wear masks protect patients, surrounded daily travellers? Except data proves it’s due testing. Increased positive test % hospitalizations. God, fuckwads need go. new data scientist even worse previous one... Hurr durr go even tho ignored guidelines . Way douche someone asking simple question trying help. Damn Well, they're saying expect 70% population get it. (Me mine going 30% doesn't.)

 Oh, work outside - hydrate, hydrate hydrate more. read somewhere sucker/spike things virus particle attach easier mucous membrane that's well hydrated. includes stomach, eye sockets, nasal...etc. Hatha Yoga supposed immune system building. Good luck. *Fake News! bring light inside asshole, heard there's way that, sometimes UV light, sometimes VHS, bring inside, deep inside bring back put back in, gently, vigorously, know cases zero.* here. Damn. Ur kidding ur self 1/3 population needs work full time regardless...that alone makes stopping significantly slowing virus impossible... two, think ur trying stop something 1000s times smaller fine wood sawdust....that also contagious Yep got it!!
It really simple.

You're thinking it.

A real president would jumped right waited 4 months later anything it.

And didnt really anything it. rated 8-10 hour day, given usage, per week. “And everybody clapped” - ofc that’s morally wrong allow sucker keep money.

W. C. Fields commenting on. US magical land freedom say freedom speech. Capacity limits masks make seem reasonable, especially given it’s outdoors. real issue enforcing mask usage cleaning thousands shared contact surfaces.

I wouldn’t really want sort crowded area general though. hated crowds times, sure hell hate Way go Arnold.. racism? angry rioting police murdering people. write representatives. them. county, state senators, mayor, city council, congressmen, national senators, etc.  again.

snail mail letters. email them. call phone. hell, even send faxes.  

encourage others well. 


and elections come around, VOTE hold people responsible. make sense, bottleneck got cleared people got better high flow oxygen, also time lot people wound deteriorating point need vent I'm guy originally replied to, providing link asked for.

As point plan, seem rarity sub, neither ""lockdown forever"" ""open everything up"" person. think acceptably good job start thing. perfect means, stop exponential growth occurring slowed down.

So are. People still getting infected, recently, hospital systems whole able cope.

The plan, think implemented month ago, then, ASAP good time any, would national communications strategy major goals/messages:

1. Thanking front line workers, entire population sacrifices made lockdown. basic psychology people willing endure hardships recognized thanked so.

2. narrative governments media wearing mask patriotic. Produce give away hundreds millions facemasks american flags (admittedly tough message gotten hand). Allow people buy masks make provide financial incentives (tax deductions/credits). would probably limit set prevent hoarding, think is/was doable.

3. toughest one, better strategy provide people business owners difficult time. Unfortunately, $1200 2-3 months sufficient live on, believe least unrest seen last month simply people need something lash end ropes. money individiuals, also incentives businesses keep people employed essential functions (tax breaks employers keep people employed, government paying $5/hr subsidy entice people keep working certain industries, tax breaks companies spend money things like PPE, plastic guards, thorough cleaning services, etc.).

There little things, cover major points. unfortunate, transparent projection people like cannot fathom standing what's right without anticipation reward. give away. betting unavailability vaccines several years (dubious, given unprecedented effort put towards that), also lack improvement treatment disease.

We've learned dexamethasone significantly reduce mortality. they've already lost part gamble. trippin’ people think care share meme says HIPAA laws make illegal ask anything disability (they don't). 

They honestly think right fake disability, demand accommodation said fake disability, threaten airline ADA violation accommodating them. honestly think *demand* accommodation, tell anyone need accommodation for. Pieces shit, them. chronic stupidity count? Spreading disease political freedom. don’t right get people sick. Sorry call BS this. type post make seem majority people dying ""nursing homes"" near end life anyway.

Many deaths occurring long term care facilities assisted living. Illinois....

 

I two grandmothers lived nearly decade assisted living facilities (one cognitive issues arthritis/mobility issues). like apartment complex's restaurant, gym, bingo hall, facility excursions, etc. 

I guess makes people feel better believing people basically hospice that's reality, many people many years ahead them. Damn hide cool stuff Sorry, forgot don’t understand math. Let explain slowly, 80% isnt 100% Except given Americans want freedumbs, basically saying inevitable. rate may close zero daily deaths early August 1st.

I'm going assume that's attempt humor. Terrible comparison sounds catchy fits narrative sub. Upvote away would suggest maintain order country full mass corruption deeply disturbed evil people? Nice job denying reality. Enjoy SARS. ...... wow Imagine saying bigot, racist homophobe still support Trump. 

&amp;#x200B;

""I believe racism exists I'm still BLM supporter!"" Yeesh. CT mask useage pretty high, 80%+, stores enforcing rules. area get hit like NYC metro even though we're close... masks help, acting early. states resistant acting &amp; could get real ugly. Let's get denialist holes wearing first, discuss upgrades. interesting change see public altercation everyone phone everyone else's face. He's saying trust people dedicated lives studying viruses spread. way possibly trust people correct going large event unmasked getting sick yourself.  sick people can’t civil.... must resort childish swearing. lost intelligence moment. 

 one talking permanent lockdown you. fact one even mentioned that. good ways reopen one arguing all. 

You sound like idiot. Please stop Yeah, “attention whore” much accurate. Alright let’s fully open economy get people back work, we’ll fine wear masks right? Nice fairy tale planning. It’s going happen, does, short lived enter fall / winter. people keep pretending instead preparing realistic outcomes? way read bulk Chicago's cases European origin, separate origin event virus Chinese strain.  2 year old twins. question even get wear masks? real. go theater watch movie, eat overpriced snacks drinks make wanna piss halfway film. So... President? Holy shit. We’re beyond fucked. Anyone thinks one person covid going delusional. Curious see two weeks today Hear, hear. Here, here. Good to... hear this... hairy (?) man. don’t even believe covid19 real? ahead time. bullshit lie, designed something else entirely. virus, even mild one less .09% death rate!
Things far dangerous, think, plan working people need wake time.

Please ask evidence get figures rings truth waking up, good thing. sheer idiocy simply defies imagination. fully expect see Rock president life time.

Maybe running country together Andrew Yang something. Omg want flatten curve?!? Wait hold they're firing doctors hospitals empty? Hmm.... bought Disney showing nothing Disney movies! US deaths WW1. 
2x US deaths Vietnam. 
30,172 Benghazis 


And we're even close woods yet.  


We better hope vaccines work (or people start wearing fucking masks) Chinese people's lives worthless like American morons, sociopaths. know. giant nose dolf lundgrens body  Jersey Share. like 4th July late March NY plates around. boyfriend got hair cut today, barber wasn’t wearing mask. Can’t imagine many people’s hair she’s cut without mask on.  main argument manly, whatever fuck means. Let someone say 

I got shit years calling complete fucking moron fence sitter (Yeah, he's Trumper too. Said he'd support Sanders Sanders dropped primaries. he's full MAGA).  LMAO Wow ain't fancy, actually wearing clothes watching Netflix! needs federal forebearance mortgages rent.

There option. States ability except perhaps regional local banks. No, said want go make people wear masks. go make people wear masks. mayor police chief Houston ringleaders protests? that's nobody stay 4th July?

I'm sorry hard problems creative that. can't say ""oh well can't work I'm salty protests"" gotta think outside box man. something that's already happened. saving lives today. hands say can't, definitely can't. May well shoot economy right knee let virus decimate city think fair harder protestors. 

We make decisions argue honestly like government, instead using whataboutism say*it's fault can't anything* give let go hell spite. 

This real deal, life death, pointing fingers, human beings almost anything decide to. decide to? agree you, commissioners still plan playing, minds changed bigger outbreaks? mayors/governors stop them? schools decide meet person (which ncaa requires sports)? 

what's gonna tipping point go (full schedule, full attendance) cancel all? No, you’re thinking conception virus works. I've following numbers tests US. rising, faster relevant countries, would even say little slower most. countries seeing drops cases US seeing rises cases, doubt rise tests. They're echoing pence and, extension, daddy trump. Great. F\*\*\* him. end day kick really ever reason want like restaurant store ask leave. reasons may chance court them, probably not. No, wouldn't, everyone fucking wore masks. say good him. seems found way make idiot career. could American? point flattening curve making hospital capacity isn’t full. enough beds ventilators good. don’t want unnecessary deaths, know can’t prevent *all* deaths. [But Patient-Doctor confidentiality!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH55dFlF_Rg&amp;t=3m22s) scares me, bunch April New York States, across country Summer, would even worse April, unless virus weakens bunch, point ceases damage anybody. Cases, patients, OP. Huge difference. cite can. think people making illegal wear one making political.. make white people work meat plants then? like real pandemic doesnt give shit are.


Protest want, quick question tho, expect continue protesting everyone protesting dies out? hope airline told leave plane really would loved said, ""Sir, please grab belongings # WALKAWAY...off plane."" anyone dumb requirement comes governor handed federal government? personally. keep couple masks car it’s much hassle pop real quick, even though transmission majority drive thrus pretty unlikely. math, Floridians currently likely DIE COVID-19 win $300 $2 Florida Lottery scratch off. jackpot, $300. 

Of course, that’s assuming deaths static growing number get worse.  get bonus points mentioned original post. 

Too bad, hoped informed. professor gives good advice:

Gets thrown plane. Gets car fastens government mandated seatbelt drives home.... Hell yeah dude. That's comforting hear. emailed landlord situation.

Your move.  many ppl lack empathy realize wearing masks save friends family protect live post truth era, people find anything online reinforces whatever absurd beliefs may have. Absolutely!

People fucking dumb. Well, bad, wonder connected meat packer hotspots. World ending news allowed Yep. states learn this. think people region midwest who've short break Florida come home virus 4th July events. Linkdump incoming: Ok thanks! problem, central debate solvable science, moral question.

I merely establishing validity claim black Americans faced 400+ years oppression, cherry top extrajudicial asking considered opposite reading material. 

Yes, that's posted meta-studies.

You know, study available research?

The science undeniably demonstrates black Americans faced 400+ years systematic oppression systemic racism. 

Are Karen, willing concede science shows?

Note: conceding central debate spread Corona virus sake BLM moral (which yet done work demonstrate protests have, way, get that), **just admitting vast body scientific evidence supports validity existence profound systemic racism.** Stealing taser cop pointing said cop longer considered “unarmed”.

Karen's way I'm familiar, could please explain it? something want know moronic? US treating us US long treated territories.

We still know many people died US decided ignore Hurricane Maria's devastation Puerto Rico.

Their infrastructure collapsed, people get chemo dialysis. struggled rebuild US takes much money Puerto Rico yet they've never given representation. Bro midsummer White america pretty good genocide. know things bad NY Governor going quarantine people Florida coming NY rules apply them, silly  fucked. 

They state 7 million people. gonna die!!!!!!!!!!! high school students. Nope, keep side pond! think mean America Conservative led Countries. That's generally bullshit someone says they're medically exempt wearing mask. lungs weak wear mask, respiratory pandemic. vegetables, generally stored refrigerator. labs, virus samples stored refrigerators keep slightly suspended active state maintain longevity. think safest let groceries sit while, stuff that's refrigerated best either sanitize/wash packaging and/or cook safe temperature kill present virus surface wish could president. heat killing would weaken it. we've seen bad hitting medical staff, viral load seems play big part severe infection is. virus killed would mean people getting lower viral load. winter rolls around average viral loads exposure go see worse infections, higher death rate less cases asymptomatic. strain leaves station 8am. B strain traveling twice fast C strain arrives time strain. long die? Pretty much them. course undergrad one ot top 10 party schools US, may warped view :) saw video another passenger flight. attention whore completely moscharacterized kicked off. Ducey coward. things gone completely hell, doubts he'd even then.

Even new mask policies, despite saying ""I want everyone wear masks outside"", pushed responsibility local governments take blame. data available regarding anti-vaxxers? Like age range them, education level? Meh? I'm genuinely sure explanation insufficient. weird attitude have.

We know virus kills people, surges deaths follow surges cases. ample evidence world.

Why sarcasm? absolutely surge cases going here. gov provide seat belts? Protest began Minnesota. place virus mostly control 21 days ago. fact seeing sizable uptick cases 5 day average continues grow “Normal body temperature varies person, age, activity, time day. average normal body temperature generally accepted 98.6°F (37°C”

Since virus thrive temps, I’m sure people think heat eliminate virus tell people live lives  rocket science. Either keep extra around, tie extra piece clothing around face. questions sub blow mind.

As post research, posted meta-studies research?

One great follies age information people think technically ability look information up, also foundational knowledge base required correctly parse interpret information. sorts people who, post study showing point wrong, go read abstract, try find flaws methodology study justify cognitive dissonance ignoring it. worse, accuse others appealing authority try cite sources, never acknowledge **appeal ignorance**.  appeal ignorance occurs person mistakenly believes something true know enough subject, given enough evidence know otherwise.

I'm sorry, no. random redditor expert subject, neither I. think peer reviewed study posted bunk, find another peer reviewed study challenges results, preferably one references points methodological flaws study. cannot explain uninterested anyone’s armchair researcher opinion results peer reviewed study. That's experts, that's peer review, that’s scientific method.

They researcher, embarrassing think ""review"" relevant conversation. Why? real understanding takes lot learning things directly related topic hand. enough look part that's controversial; got understand relevant background material really grok looking at. That's lot basics, sometimes lot history, understanding, understand anything. Without proper context, understanding fully understand looking at, assume scientists full crap part conspiracy, easy mislead. Unfortunately, that's get people who[ they're talking still think they've 'done research.'

Because thing. studies I’m posting? [They might way prove post studies fail reproduce results challenge methodology. tell think it’s bad study, nothing could useless that.

""When went show report card would say county, among things, asked delete report card showed counties, pretty much, ready reopening,"" says. ""And want draw attention that.""

Jones says superior asked open data alter numbers state's coronavirus positivity rating would change 18% 10% — state would appear meet target reopen.

""To me, read like kind political conspiracy higher directive,"" Jones says. ""It seemed like people expected brought results, results support plan written, not, seemed panicked, like figure way make results match plan.""

She says state's dashboard, person tests positive counted positive test once, matter many times test positive. person tests negative counted time test negative coronavirus. Jones says many residents, health care workers, require repeated testing, state's dashboard artificially deflating true positivity rate.

Next, fail CBP training deemed incapable even Border Patrol. point Country decided cannot trusted bear firearm official capacity, crushing dreams destroying sense self. 

*Then* join TSA, welcomes open arms. Thanks sentiment, certain degree American disagree. 

We “rich” nation longest notice happening China. seems unable admit made mistake keeps postponing inevitable. wonder charges brought forward years now. caused unnecessary deaths economic problems. Like, sure, might joke two bedside personally know anyone affected seriously point believe hoax truly beyond saving. Looking John hopkins numbers, looks like pretty much lowest points first week June. definitely increased since. america, lol. Every single country failed contain initial outbreak shown actually impossible protect vulnerable. People Autism spectrum could probably public, also would difficulty wearing masks many sensitive material stimuli. 

Source: older brother spectrum (very high functioning) barely stand wearing mask. try needed, otherwise stays home doesn’t want wear mask Ron DeSantis blaming Ron DeSantis COVID. little empathy people voted him. [They never early tell Sweden's herd immunity strategy risky, unethical gamble unlikely pay long term. Especially since even know herd immunity really achieved disease. Many indicators showing immunity may durable, makes sense since well studied cornoaviruses humans produce durable immunity. 

Sweden based straegy idea huge % cases totally asymptomatic IFR extremely low. proven false. 

We already improved clinical treatments, one drug cuts mortality quite lot. seeing that, Sweden frontloading deaths ethically wrong. easy predict something like would happen *of course* medical community find better ways treat paitents novel disease, even disregarding vaccine emerging.

Sweden's herd immunity strategy failure. Plain simple. benefits, downsides. has:

* high death toll relatively speaking

* economy bad neighbors much worse metrics 

* treated pariah nation ""Europe's Leper Colony"" one commentator put Swedes barred several EU countries, etc.

* Many formerly healthy young Swedes came disease suffered long term, may long term disabilities now
 

In case even Tegnell says say right fall: even though think clearly say major failure, even according architect strategy we'll able judge pretty soon. I’m guessing wasn’t major city. option case we're part public library. Unless city state mandates it, can't mandate it. :( cost two top shelf cocktails buy entire bottle good stuff Thanks, shows lot great data. Like Arizona Arkansas better week two weeks ago! 

Yes cases increasing places open. can’t believe anyone understand would happen. Without vaccine course cases increase virus go away. 

Sorry, exactly point plan? terk er jerbs! People know virus spreads though.  Mirco droplets stay air 3 hours indoors.  6 feet doesnt shit,  hours leave room still infecting people.  

Outside safe everyone shares restrooms.... We're still first wave. styles medical masks pretty damn uncomfortable. One size never really fits all. worked patient closed quarters right gonna fly interview cold didn’t wanna catch pretty uncomfortable 15 mins wearing brand. 

We n95 california fires real, real bad point schools canceling classes air quality sometimes used initial part epidemic: hour (I beard) it’s insanely uncomfortable, hot itchy. single use ones bought seem better limited use far, order minutes in/out convenience store. letting beard rage kinda quarantined choice, certainly imagine spectrum trouble kinda stimulus. panic disorders since def artificially make feel stuffed claustrophobic. High end ones like n95 pretty stifling feel like gotta yell them. 

Now hike wear bandana. Doubles neck face protection. sure much really helps try keep distance. aren’t bad unless it’s super hot actually kinda nice cooler days wind blows be

I think safe say attendees 50+ classified obese means coronavirus cases start trending massively down, new normal shall ""outdoor social gatherings ok, indoor social gatherings ok"".

We'll able small outdoor weddings, outdoor hairdressers, trade shows conventions. Good Yes voted ""request"" emergency rule decree ended. Since protestors resulting spike worry political rallies (e.g., Tulsa Trump Biden gatherings)? Wait seriously telling black community hasn’t severely damaged? I’m saying it’s fault it’s damage right everybody see? ever set foot poor black neighborhood? headline chooses endanger others potentially lethal combination ignorance arrogance Americans incredibly stupid. I’m American say it. “Gay conservative”. possible? country already best border enforcement Europe prepared deal contagious disease outbreak started outside borders nearly everyone else. surprising. Whoops Cases US staying steady deaths drop. Where's nationwide increase cases. cases holding steady deaths that's what's happening. less 1% positive rate. amazing. That's control virus spread. get pathetic grown man telling lies get twitter likes. drama queen pinched Ulnar Nerve I'm typing two fingers :P 2.24 million 120k deaths.. wow can't draw conclusion number tests performed increased proportionally. know hasn't, we've read sources hasn't. think articles providing simple context. also think OP getting downvoted skeptical searching context. like he's screaming fake news saying things fine. sub reputation echo chamber people politely ask discussion information downvoted aggressively shot down.

Oh man That's works. Companies right refuse service whoever want, whatever reason. right shop somewhere else. Well, much Summer killing thing. *rhythmic snapping noises* Benghazi used run guns Syria, might murders.

If states proactive pandemic, would less deaths.

In instances, issue systemic policies caused deaths.

Benghazi scandal murders. allegedly scandal duty protect four. embassy received threats ongoing embassy attacks.

The investigation examination whether embassy closed, US enough protect four, whether US could sent reinforcements time.

It's *less valid* ask similar questions 120,000 COVID-19 deaths valid spend trillions analyzing 4 Benghazi deaths.

Either US cares systemic violence people let's pretend US government culpable death four death 120,000. dodge Coronavirus, dodge ball.  Nah, evil. Lawful Neutral worst. 0% time works time. Huh? No, actually opposite. US time lockdown soon (or did, reopened soon). UK well. Sweden too!

Basically... Covid-19 pro infiltrator. notice first 10 cases already 10000.
Unless, course, lookout, none us December/January. bothering much: *lose. Remember government said COVID would shut economy again? Pepperidge Farm remembers. Well, next month pretty much set stone, know get control. northeast quite well. Lockdowns, mandatory masks, etc. mystery. !remindme 4 weeks think Baseball even Football going happen year. certainly isn’t I’m gonna point false information see Every virus listed stopped like Coronavirus. Hell even SARS, closest relative, stopped killed hosts quickly. better compare flu, also small death rate yet spreads easily.

SK 1 guy visit bars caused shutdown whole block contract trace 100 people. simply logical reasonable expect norm. country size US influence (meaning international travel must) going get rid something contagious. 

It's learn live simply live like hermit. me, anyone wear mask banned using hospital services well - let flounder second wave... cant people actually report actual numbers taht matter like hospitalizations Hubris, arrogance, ineptitude officials. modelling hilariously bad flawed get go. issued model showing 4-6million people Stockholm county would get infected. ...Stockholm county 2mm. It'd hilarious destructive sad. takedown modeling memorable since correct:  good news ! think revise previous numbers new ICU beds added, swear I've seen past utilizations drop days later. Looks like spring training going well Huh? wonder NFL going cope this, since lot lineman upward 300lbs cultural differences Wuhan, Beijing Milan. Lots people wear mask Asia year round, Italy even males greet familiar males cheek cheek kisses gets right breathing zone another person.

These factors could easily change R0 spread rate. Lower spread rate Asia general mask use, higher spread rate Italy general mask use cheek kissing. couldn’t released fucking bright red MAGA masks given away free? considered healthy US anywhere matter. stop fat shaming dead kid? overweight yea. deserve die Covid it? No.

If anything scared obesity huge states. Child Adult obesity alike. I'm wondering something else going like people already immunity past coronavirus infections. contagious secondary household infection rate low. IL cases climbing month ago. 2 months lockdown still growing. last month cases dropping. Masks probably make difference seems like it. We'll see states made large improvements new spikes open more. Yep, people I've never talked buddies. Keep fighting good fight! Wow gonna get little bit COVID, tell mother [""We conversation. think order called for, think legal, think \- Cuomo Rhode Island people back then.

Granted, least Rhode Island responded making order stronger quarantining everyone else well, rather backing down, good that. saw bar open last night packed people masks on. Easily 50-75 people small bar.
Edit: maricopa County political stance inconsiderate asshole.

No, actually, political stance made famous #walkaway movement, asks people reject violence parties promote it. AA respect LGBT community? typical conservative thing asshole break BAN CUZ IM CONSERVATIVE. CENSORSHIP!!! wouldn’t posting hadn’t already messaged mods...of course response. keep sticking buddies! Curious see determined court able determine investigation.  ...how get kicked plane  matter gets arrested convicted, long trump president he'd get pardon. 39.6% nothing sneeze at. doesn’t help that’s damn sure People country need understand freedoms liberties end second infringe upon somebody else’s rights.

That guy right wear mask. he’s public area public health safety concern masks required. right wear mask override another person’s right live safety I've heard exact thing said elsewhere absolutely evidence exact story. That's odd. 

Spreading bullshit like causes harm people. type misinformation causes people take virus seriously, infection spread, people die. right. let Target without mask, there's huge sign door closed entrance monitor sides.

Local Walmart live set up. mask wearing 50/50 best! ""Conservative activist""

No, he's not. He'll make ton money  Idk downvoted. still stop spread Dat clickbait knee jerk title tho. also known healthcare disparities United States regarding access care quality care black vs white Americans.  Wait say word can't??? Fucking stupid bot. Japan lied? ""continuing open back up"" fully opened like 3-4 weeks now.  You’d rather stronger? know pessimistic, didn’t know people hoping high infection death rates. Technically three. Lincoln pro wrestler turned politician. Cuomo quickly proving worst governor history NY. directly responsible thousands deaths. Is***  Arnold place pretty much hit height political career, already served governor can't run president.  speak mind without worrying future voters. I'm mechanic one regionals I'm happy they're putting foot down. airlines need make people feel safe flying again. job security health depends it. Nope. I'm feeling fine realist. much rather deal little stress risk long term lung damage corona. BLM killed grandma socially distancing   Drove back uni home yesterday passed storefronts shopping centers alarmed number old people gloves, masks, anything, touching everything sight caring all. us agree maybe virus mostly affecting old people, stay inside? stayed wiped grocery items, shipped items, etc, problem all. Instead, they're going bang. people experienced wars lifetime ""sickness blown proportion"". They're killing time belts primarily help person wearing it,

Only prevent injuries accident. help society whole driving post-accident medical costs down.

If wear seatbelt wind seriously injured incapacitated... everyone else going wind paying help rest life disability payments higher insurance costs rest us. Aha! World Health Organization orchestrated pandemic get great deal boats! 20+ players test positive team sit out. team loses game. one player positive test came back negative. team infected anyway team lost game reason. 

Doesn’t seem like great plan. He's reactivist. Let guess, we'll see two weeks. lost battle wearing mask became political statement. states is, states isn’t. Pretty sure ones saying Arizona’s numbers increased testing though. Oof, go back DFW. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Seems reasonable me. would surprised say exact words near future. We're frustrated them. Cheers.  shirt shoes mask device! What’s problem I’m already stuck air someone wearing mask I’d rather get going time still stuck also find new connecting flight studies ""prove"" anything COVID. way soon. scientific process making reasonable assumptions based prior knowledge proven otherwise. Right reasonable assumption operates way viruses operate: fight once, fight again. evidence contrary.

Additionally, would difficult ""prove"" way mean. would purposely infect people.  article talking opposite (hiding cases) Two new cases arrived NZ, isolated them. they're stopping spread. Event else NZ risk. 

""The flu"" group viruses, like coronavirus group viruses. vaccine could get help stomp annual strain flu year, crappy response (and inability accurately predict strain 100%) kills many. got vaccine, fewer people would die, care enough. 

Influenza different coronavirus though. I'm sure brought up. prove viruses can't beat? Polio Smallpox? get rid viruses. ACTUALLY TRY. Giving acting like everything's fine stop spread. 

You see coronaviruses past. SARS coronavirus. stopped it. stop this. state pandemic inevitable. take action early on, didn't. dig this, hanging mall going movies next month answer. 

South Korea densely populated cities right next original source virus. 240 cases per 1 million people. 

Canada 2665 per million.

Germany 2271 per million. 

The US 6878 per million.

We screwed up. Throwing caution wind make situation even worse. FUCK PAYWALL JOURNALISM would glad sponsor guy trip Tulsa tommorrow's rally.  earliest known cases travel Egypt well. Fort Bend County TX. Medical professionals tend know little public policy economics. 

Lives cost them. Yours, mine, baby’s old woman’s. 🥱🥱🥱😴😴😴😴 did, decided go it. called ""Amazon Prime Day."" Thank thoughtful post! kind last line.  United States least, protests I've seen many masks  What's job?

Thank pointing out. I'm still waking up. Ah yes, great sign intelligence, skeptic. Nah terrorists antifa free human bean plays right Tests mean Cases thinking...how convenient! First come cases, hospitalisations, deaths. people understand this? increased testing. good testing now. Case increases mostly reflect increased infections unsustainable. SARS2 watch FOX bulldozes fake news replication. Buck Folsonaro. 2.550.648 tests far (probably bit useless government can't keep track anything) Who’s saying this? Also average incubation period 5-6 days. This!  correct answer. Murder victim front page NYT scare excess deaths - covid killed some, lockdown/hysteria killed some. never said covid hoax - said death count higher be, number confirmed-by-test.  security plane handcuff person seat place mask themselves, one asshole even able adjust since they're handcuffed.  Physical distancing matter. might get hate saying personal opinion someone living South Carolina, anyone travels state Myrtle Beach looking vacation kind person would expect wear mask honestly. Myrtle Beach cesspool sex trafficking crime, there's nothing good it. Yeah protests made spike. Mmhmmmm. states opened everything masks required. Mmmmmmmhmmmmmmmmmmmmm ignore global warning well, can’t surprising. paraphrasing all, that's transcript. got sense smell back everything smelled really gross week so. lost smell 6 weeks, came back weird smell eventually go away. didn’t. Median one three commonly used types averages. Median average.

Here another source explains “averages found three ways -- mean, median mode.” case missed first still America South America... Answer question. Pretty convenient new mask law reinforced days following Newsom approved $1B China mask deal.  


But I’m sure politicians zero financial gain making decisions health they’re good people. BS stunt. flew American last week. entirely full flight 2 people weren’t wearing mask. YouTube like Wikipedia. gotta look sources behind presented facts. 

Discounting YouTube, great disfavor. employed still poverty, need take steps improve life  There's also issue leadership top, Trump wearing mask, federal government mandated it. East Asia, government told citizens wear mask, mandated early on. New York reported 796 cases 79,303 tests. Pretty amazing think back March/April 10k cases per day less tests. find weird?

I never said anything paternalism Swedish state, think everything culture ridiculous Systembolaget, paternity leave quotas, police sending choppers weed smoking kids etc. exception. statement still false, antidepressants prescribed studied psychiatry. that's something would leave bad review for. True true. Still think I'm order stay afloat adaption key. Also refuses wear mask. fine, prefer cabbage making salads. general rule thumb something reported major health benefits peer reviewed study done confirm this, otherwise anybody could make literally anything up.

Testing benefits Vitamin terms fighting infection example would fairly easy. Get 4 groups people, give one group placebo give 3 groups varying amounts vitamin test white blood count infection fighting indicators introducing infection participants.

This basis science, don’t know you’re complete utter moron. Go back moaning depression fucking degenerate. Someone downvoted this? Nice. many sexual assaults occurred went unreported frat house? look know you’ve probably already mentally decided real death rate disease 5.xx percent you’re pretty much using logic 

“we tested two people died. clearly disease 100% death rate”
or
“we tested two people survived. clearly disease 0% death rate”

do little bit critical thinking realize US way less testing resources infrastructure needs country it’s size

if could test 330million people 5.xx percent held would eat crow lol run ""blissful idiot"" problem. Christians (raised Pentecostal anecdotal view this) believe something good happens, God them. something bad happens, God's plan even hurts them. people still absolutely believe blood Jesus protect them.......from Devil's plans. die horrible death, God wanted. don't, God wanted. Yeah agree. glorious pieces shit are. Wtf conservative activist? Stupidity already 2nd epidemic US..nothing active According article he's ""ardent supporter Donald Trump"".

So least, he's fine racism. Half Americans follow Trump means mask Sorry, I'm buying whole ""we care customers"" average American Airlines seat pitch 30 inches. nurse? replies far reference Tulsa trump. Strip bias away. Biden political.gatherings. Yeah, ridiculous. gfs aunt risk officially, couldn’t get test. Even hospital told 99 percent sure since wasn’t admitted, wouldn’t test her. Hard make comparison also Sweden's issue. wonder you. reference point comparing Canadian provinces count specific states. Hawaii closest comparable 2 provinces.

Hawaii: 1.4M population, 760 cases 
Saskatchewan: 1.2M population, 708 cases 
Manitoba: 1.4M population, 308 cases Americans ignore way science lol  Every antibody test shows actual cases much higher.

There’s still 1% “death rate” *is* terrifying.

But purposefully ignoring fear-monger, frankly unnecessary considering scary 1% own. Ya, woke saw FL, Cali, AZ, TX still trying set new records.  wondering know 500k recovered American states can't post recovery numbers seems weird Honestly, want men wear masks, start saying virus attacks cells testes. Instant increase mask usage. know knowledge common. I'm woman thought still makes flinch. Halfway America! first wave! lockdown started finished early here. “Why can’t wear mask?”
“It’s hard breathe normally already”
“Well Covid sure fuck then, better wear mask” Thanks :) load bullshit, numbers experts predict accurately. 

 article late April expected herd immunity within month. 

Ridiculous can't answer question? Yes, IIRC list packed right now, still question accuracy right now. plan donating can. suck dick guys wear masks going drive thru? know places plastic covering window curious see couple people wearing masks Totally agree. good stay positive, also stay cautious. blocked Yeah that's really me. I'm even lazy, eat much salad. I'd throwing ton. Oh shid JFC

Reading twitter thread... I'm lost words. 
* Masks give co2 poisoning. 
* Covid blown proportion. 
* Liberal hoax. 
* elites creating covid agenda their... Yeah what? middle sentence brain singly rebootet.

I really hope come Russian troll factory. can't real. Chile we're pretty fucked btw, capital (Santiago), 1 every 45~ people coronavirus

We're country cases per capita behind Qatar, Qatar really deaths they're pretty great

My grandpa died past-yesterday COVID, mother positive, father suspicious probably positive since symptoms

This sucks, guys, please, take care yourself

As PS: started summer we're near Winter getting worse worse day Yeah, person forces wear mask gimp mask.  true

Ok MAJORITY. states end far worse NY

Idk yall set bar pretty high. Especially know placing covid+ cases nursing homes cure virus. inhale lettuce (or vegetables) Wow $20 ! India getting N95 less dollar. Actually 50 cents per pc. go Fox talk ""tyranny"" population much younger. random guessing, wave form collapsed either cat's dead talking ass. Right *both.* Blame brown people. else new. DeSantis total piece shit. E coli issue... Yup.

No one insisting memorial. Politicians holding moments silence.

We treat deaths like treat ""casualties war."" Statistics. died COVID-19.

There's ownership. one takes responsibility. names, faces, bios get mass shootings.

They're invisible, nameless dead. wanted re-open schools fully... So... want risk life. want risk long-term complications. want drain taxed healthcare system, want risk spreading others.

So going stay home next 4 years? never going away. might ever get vaccine, even proven completely effective 10+ years. I’m sure sunshine hot weather kill virus. Right?

right? Deaths lag 6 weeks infection, severe patients ventilators typically 2+ weeks hospitals usually ventilator patients ones don’t make it. usually estimate deaths see today patients may put ventilator 2-6 weeks ago. 

One source ventilator info, although there’s lot there: study suggest all. 

1. done recently outside infected January, 2-3 months. 

2. suggests 10% severe cases unknown percentage possibly 90% range asymptomatic cases lose IgG antibodies. 

3. makes suggestions loss immunity, would still contingent loss mucosal antibodies antibody- making memory cells. 

Despite worrisome, 10x faster antibody loss seen SARS. good analysis! time I've thinking Sweden's strategy line image ultra rational. may onto something here: think they're ultra rational can't begin accept simple, medieval measures. understand premise. problem gambling public health stake stubborn continue path numbers got worse norway, ireland, netherlands, france(!!!!).

Oh agreed. theory *maybe* herd immunity might make sense point future... However, think *always* unethical gamble due high degree unknowns. learn, less sense makes. imo totally predictable. 

But yes stubbornness borne arrogance, locked due March Folly / sunk cost fallacy quite thing. ridiculous still refuse admit messed up, think maybe never will. least increasingly *saying* change course towards TTI now, acknoledging moving away dumpsetr fire strategy needlessly cost lives renderd Odin knows many disabled. 

BTW, aside, comic surprisingly insightful Nordic cultural tendencies: it, character Sweden often portrayed arrogant, hyper rational technocrat. Seems like author sort nailed it. get point but... condoms law  Huh? 505 inhabitants per million metres? what? Cases?
All know definitely 505 million inhabitants. Sorry bad english. look fix it. apologize try improve english. agree. None theories posit COVID-19 emerged August explain virus somehow made Europe spreading significant levels major Chinese cities. far air traffic Wuhan Beijing Wuhan Milan. Never said don’t... show said anything close that. Ever? Like long term....I don’t believe ever even thought sentence. US response totally fucked. Several countries great job. confused printed word also know another person, 36, icu vent 2 weeks, MMR. [X] citizens smarter Americans obvious idiot believe George Washington born England. Let natural selection thing. people want die let them. number reported Saturday usually typically week Florida. Sunday Monday numbers typically low ones represent tests processed weekend labs full staff. Yet somehow South Korea, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, Austria Greece managed keep nursing home residents alive ... going rally... knew policy. cool wrong two reasons

1) absolutely denial liberty. negligible one, still denial liberty. thing seat belts, indoor smoking bans, required wear clothes outside, etc.

2) buys myth people care liberty. don't. People beliefs mask true beliefs language liberation co-opting popular ideas, like myth America maximally free country. Addressing express beliefs instead denying work-or-die undertones ignoring decades old tactic even people waffle complaining online censorship supporting brutalization press daily basis. testing deadly contagious disease medically necessary? got mumps kid, hurt like hell. one things remember. mom swears got vaccine measles rubella though, proof (records), get MMR shot 1998. Ok, well guess miracle definitely 20-30% infection rate NYC caused numbers drop stay low despite reopening. Praise FSM. legally possible? enforce countrywide mandatory rationing sanitation supplies, rather suggesting hoping stores fall line?

Genuinely asking, idea stuff works legal perspective. that's currently possible hope addressed next big outbreak something infectious Never dull moment FL since beginning pandemic... Alright everyone remember relax DOOMED. Sounds intense. sure college children learn aggressive environment. Thought old headline got far ""pandemic"". going rally... knew policy booked ticket. might that. fly emotional support dog need present letter psychiatrist trainer days advance check still refuse honor ticket. regulation perfectly clear. Holy shit dumb. Unfortunately, improvements :( days left finish prescription can’t wait go see ENT person. Honestly, would take small improvement nothing all! Hopes senses come back already :( agree, problem see thing that's wrong ""the people"". Hundreds companies send CO2 atmosphere daily, guy throws tin wrong trash bin problem? Nah. seem like protests cause major spikes. Minnesota began wide spread protests three weeks ago. seeing confidence now, market showing considerable confidence. states opening continue. 

Cities that, authority federal government not. country. States rights trump federal. bad day hard high school football, nevermind NFL college True efficiency need sewing water keep needles overheating. answer unfortunately unlucky.

Hang pal, even people SARS lungs return full health People always trying win. think good compassionate reality selfish everyone else Constitution. Racism illegal days, actually.

Hahaha spoken like someone know talking about. live NY, taken work 3 months. Today first day back (I’m restaurant industry). devastated this, sat home nothing, taken work people want about. It’s upsetting seminole/oviedo? so, godspeed. Jim Bakker pure evil Actually, yes was. Yeah. starve death. /s Also, agree – next step would ""research everything surrounding beef consumption leaves conveyor belt someone puts mouth."" actually called article. 

This big point confusion – think data analysis top-of-the-funnel science. look compiled data, identify trends investigate further. means 'smoking gun.' smoking gun would finding virus meat supply showing destroyed cooking process many cases (rare steaks, pink burgers, example).

One way could test take one city, stop supplying city's grocery stores beef 1 month, eliminate room error. Beef could still served restaurants, would require restaurants serve well done meet certain temperature requirements (of course, identity point solubility. doable, know done yet. could get hold sample, would myself). 

If hypothesis correct, would see sharp drop new infection rates within 30 days, probably sooner. 

herekittie, least, take nothing else this, hope take steaks well done coming months. Ah sad, appears smaller. course, there's literally *no way* black people could find Joe fucking Biden unpalatable. stupid something? disagrees, said 10 days ago: asymptomatic transmitters. Stations really bad following 85% capacity rule. make sense help social distancing, ought following it. Oh, “put in”. get it. cryptology best! haha
Like McDonald's slogan, ""I'm LOVIN' It!"" Twitter day.



Just know assholes think somehow say health issue, let they’re allowed ask proof.   already printed laminated cards say “you permission to...” wear mask”


These people get upset people abuse system, I'll come back check 3 months. 

 ""last"". 

Pffffff. use twitter please excuse ignorance.

If block you, remove reply comment? “Hows reality tracking superior understanding financial markets bud...still thinking emotional?” said me. Clearly understanding financial markets barely taken hit. additionally told economic indicators would take hit (which not). accept wrong, it’s okay that' may right too. idea full idea bad activity community spread measured two week. surge certain states coming somewhere obviously. number reported Saturday usually typically week Florida.

I think accidentally word there. sure gonna be! Saturday highest Florida last week, that's actually typical. Prior weeks day numbers Thursday Friday. possible we'll see another big spike tomorrow, also possible high point week. lol believe you! much us well compared northeast. fellow Floridians better buckle up; COVID back March ain't fun ride. airline also say “well case can’t fly”

If medical condition incompatible safe airline travel shouldn’t letting travel. Sorry. Get well soon. Good point, forgot angle. issue dc/Maryland/VA area risk people would travel open areas closed ones spread instead...  Executive order force national lock mask wearing measures. hard, prez promotes hydroxychloroquin injecting bleach. partisan situation. agree, imprisoning people obviously answer. largest amount prisoners per capita developed world. hold ~22% world's protein population yet ~4.4% world's population. Obviously, imprisoning people helping fix massive amount corruption evil. is, unfortunately, easy fix either. opinion need reshape priorities. believe need move money police beneficial programs, especially education. can't educate people surprised people wrong. refusing help country's poor vulnerable inviting crime upon ourselves. know many people this. Never got one... probably tried extort mask making company wouldn’t play ball so, masks doofus followers. Mega yacht. They'll never disembark, making free steal money people nation long stay international waters. They'll supplies people sent in.

The entire thing fucking assholes trying claim health issue, asthma whatever bullshit think of, somehow qualifies wear mask would make illegal companies ask proof etc. cares? angry white male identifies gay upfront medical condition makes wearing mask problematic: narcissistic personality disorder. Given privilege, consider beneath take commercial flight.  Yeah fuck freedom! get jukebox dildo? Damn. You’re one going gym. I’m scared. I’ve lost almost two inches arms gained belly. Still waiting get back gym. I’m NYC...that’s part reason. conspiracy theory turn TV see say gonna die one week arrest people alone ocean mowing lawn.... politician rioting next week massive crowd?

that doesnt get wheels turning all? Like virus vanish overnight? dangerous not?

actions speak louder words

as hospitals largely empty, widely documented ive seen eyes densely populated city. nurses getting furloughed... like wtf homophobes hate he's gay. 16 countries cases per 1M population Sweden seem arguing one post. 

It's infectious, especially people trying prevent spread. NYC March. Thus spread rapidly. time NY far less Sweden doing. NY worse Sweden. months since, NY taking protective measures, outbreak Sweden catching up, NYC got terrible start. Thus far, protesting actually vector spreading virus places seen major protests places spiking right now. seems biggest risk factors involve wearing masks among groups people indoors. What's this? recent info Yep. mean, wife unlimited membership Regal, we'll let expire half unused rather sit dark masks on.

And course, people going follow rules anyway. absolutely mind boggling fact “conservative activist” upset mandates private business. GOP logic means Private business don’t make cakes homosexual couples private business. Also GOP logic, privately owned company can’t MAKE put mask. really means we've done better job securing highest risk: seniors compromised immune systems. **That** made death rate go down. demographic one hit hardest beginning. Meanwhile **there 20+% increase new infections week.** 

I'm thrilled daily death rate gone down, maybe watch new infection rate numbers saying we're 'working'. shit still full swing. Orr.. hear out... bullshit one cares reddit safely quarantined mothers basement Shoes, Shirt, Mask, Service Good.

FUCK ‘EM. ever search articles Reddit google? simply wrong. totally untrue misinformation European countries TTI programs place. Denmark, Noway, Italy, Germany, Iceland, etc. definitely functional ones. countries also trying various degrees success. 

the  primary fastest way virus die outside body via evaporation water droplet it’s suspended in. strongly influenced heat humidity, addition much surface area droplet exposed based surface it’s landed (for fomite transfer).

Inside body, there’s water everywhere regardless temperature. don’t grant accommodation it’s reasonable. person doesn’t get fly. far, schools kindergartens gütersloh county closed Nice activism moron, get stay home. Get fucked. Hopefully. (to extent) son also politician involved big scandal Brazil one closest allies sent jail yesterday, people rarely talk covid days tv so? Agreed. I’ll rock bandana day avoid shit Lots words say: idea Piece shit activist, he's grifter. Alas,I 1 orange arrow give you. Chicken nuggets elderly population thanks Cuomo. Australia too.

My state, Western Australia, subdivided 8 odd subregions even move between.

Those opened up, strong public support interstate borders closed time - Victoria/NSW still finding cases every day, whereas WA/SA/NT/Tasmania mostly clear. calling *conservative activists*? Dude terrorist he's scaring shit sane people trying protect others. Politicizing pandemic bullshit. sadly believe 100 percent true would expect similar shenanigans Florida Texas.

You don’t need hide many daily deaths, maybe 20 30 state, dramatically change public perception.

I assume wealthy nursing home businessmen also lot lose lockdown economy - owners gyms, outpatient care, etc. Diaper mask... :-) LUL cover public buildings street/sidewalk too? walk dog multiple times day, occasionally meet another person walking Residentia - masks pointless regard, public buildings, hell yes. fewer people going hospital? Jesus. What's difficult simply wearing mask? impressed resolve shown. RI Governor Gina Raimondo. RI nursing homes ravaged stats RI proportionally reasonable comparison happened Italy NYC. wonder increase per penalty. Mask Wars 2020 rages on. One side clearly stupid dangerous hypocritically claims pro-life. Hahahahahah. stupid joke could told 2020 America. weeks least probably What? Sweden nearly 40% coronavirus deaths per capita basis US.

48.9 per 100,000 Sweden vs. 35.4 per 100,000 US. work HR department certainly applies us. read confidential health information make FML determinations.

But point imply HIPAA allows sue sibling telling cousin broke leg, organizations can't disclose information without consent. Regardless, regulation I'm aware says someone demand accommodation without saying why. German meat industry disgusting joke. Nowhere meat cheap here. Meat beer!! That’s article rude. fuck off, i'm baiting wannabe trolls virus always infected young people. beginning. There's nothing new all, young people much less careful days older people. IKR? mean, long they're wearing pants, count mouth covering? get kind numbers ""imports"". community spread. Completely nonessential. 

Why open? Face masks protect you. protect others unless N95 iirc. clients wearing face meals high risk. 


Face shield protect effectiveness debated. I've read, shield needs cover rates chin. worthless.. 50$! didn’t downvote article, downvoted speculation ""Too many people, initiating population control"" Yes, everyone whose parents anti-vaxxers gets multiple boosters MMR various points childhood. suggestion give off-label MMR shot adults 30 temporarily stir immune systems. Well, kind agree also. outdoors doesnt grant immunity, even proper spacing. virus particles tiny, easily airborne stay alive air (?) Amount time. Compare fart smell, fun. fart elevator 6 people everyone going exposed immediately. fart outside crowd protestors others definitely going exposed smell, signifigantly less....unless say 1out every 10 farting repeatedly. pretty much crowd going exposed odor regardless. Point being, even 1 person say 100 infected, indoors outside, spreading contaminents every breath everyone radius (?) feet around them. think 6 foot rule joke personally, waaaay undersized. hundreds dumb nanny laws Sweden.

&amp;#x200B;

Totally ! country (which went to) dangerously close totalitarianism: nanny state becomes powerful, thin line walking on. cannot understand there's fantasy, particularly US, regarding swedish model: great many place Europe life simply much better Sweden.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm honestly tired see mentioned example: like warning want country become.  Respect HIPPO! Maybe install autonomous ejection pods get rid unruly mid flight. province done first wave. Sorry, us live places things gotten better.

We single case left hospital. also make sure social distancing maintained. lay hands people. drink communion cup. treat virus like dangerous threat is. Apple stores Waffle House COVID-19 era. Apple store closes near you, might want stay home shit get ugly. ❄️ look forward daily graphs everyday /r/Boston outlook extremely positive us 😁 happy state! i’ve seen lot information contradicts article linked.

in oklahoma 47% positive cases healthcare workers, saying washing hands ppe prevent false. able protect risk allowing everyone else resume activities pretty much best case scenario, I'm sure treating like bad thing. Believe not, outdoor anime convention Connecticut. Apparently held campground, people camp separate tents bring themselves. outdoor panel talks, also bb gun shooting, archery, outdoor cosplay contest, dodgeball, etc.

The indoor stuff dining hall, expo hall, AMV show. America Internet Explorer pandemic. guy right! go store (I live AZ) almost nobody wearing masks. really hope actually enforce rule. misread thought first wanted get denialists wear masks holes XD make claim they're it. prove it. words write even worht reading 'til that. can't. cross state border every day since pandemic began, I've never seen road block much less stopped checked. limited number roads state, think realize many is. 

Look border Westchester Connecticut, there's dozen miles. 

Or beween Rockland NJ. big highways, every border straddled neighborhood streets, sometimes next door neighbor another state. God forbid tries make best horrible situation.

But people like cry online gets richer in-laws live right Georgetown County Murrell’s Inlet. Fairly conservative area despite semi-urban. north Myrtle Beach. whole area full tourist traps locals overstuffed area made 1/4 people, best. one wearing masks. going bloodbath South Carolina. got Clemson coach Dabo wanting full football stands 2 months. 

I saw yesterday SC highest positive test rate entire country 24%. Way higher Arizona, Florida, Texas. Less total people, deaths three huge states, SC awful right getting worse. Joe: yes did, hold second, need look political party artist prefers tell like not.

*A substantial portion Reddit:* ""Ha! bet moron &lt;MEMBER PARTY OPPOSING FAVORITE POLITICAL ""The majority"" absolutely imported Mexico along southern border. quite there, Maricopa County still driver. No. meant posted make fun dead boy. don’t take joke all. It’s tragedy. It’s even clear got infected though likely mom. Hmmm...really? that's interesting. vaccines available COVID

And partake...this natural selection eugenics...hmmm... ""As Thursday, nation's [U.S.A.] seven-day average new Covid-19 cases increased 15%  compared week ago.""

Not good new all. Continued growth rate devastating many many MANY people. Luckily, California passed everyone to, hopefully put sense him. halfway across country... Yup. practically begging people rest home even think virus. tests done hospitals.  Trade skoal? disagree dangerous. think need bend backwards make seem dangerous is.

Why matter? Well, shapes response. massive indiscriminate lockdowns we've engaged in, extent they've worked all, seem limit casualties much poorly targeting people vulnerable. 18 year olds risk, wasting resources protecting them.

Of course, mean people wear masks individually careful, see value (and actually substantial negative value) convincing people something not. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

BTW always love performance Commando Total Recall rest shirt reads “Just Dumb Ass.” said partial opening phases actually so... there’s fudging said guy locked up, oppressed, restricted freedoms, forced stay inside weeks end.

He asked wear mask 3.5 hour flight, threw fucking tantrum it. Yup. seems odd case nobody asking ""why fuck many pneumonia deaths right now."" recognize unemployment economic indicator? official economic recession???? continue conversation must answer questions

Your refusal accept facts change them.... speculative bubble investors floating burst full weight recession unemployment come even miracle still change fact impacts virus contrary opinion supposed self dealing expert financial, physical 100000 plus died. (Each year life cut short covid American worth 50 129k way let's forget either)


Are ignoring impact trillions dollars additional debt incurred keep financial markets stable? ignore literally every bit evidence misled hold one clearly unstable untethered number crow victory...its frankly embarrassing you. also afraid say exactly means tell like is...except they're spend every day explaining really meant _______ ________. Wear mask..don’t wear mask..you get way..you can’t get way..oh wait let’s change that...BIGGEST issue feeling lack credibility. 

The best thing could said “it’s new virus really don’t know enough it..we fill go...” talk prove. 

Already CDC came today everyone concerned protests basically right person talking directly you..while morning scientists saying bunch people bar spewing droplets air making cloud virus. 

The media needs stop putting every ENT gyno “expert” people don’t believe anyone scientists answers. someone studied economics, completely agree. Apparently people watch Fox News day know economy. voted down, know could second wave violent crime committed minorities, assume too? Leftists always lol. He's absolutely right. he's done biggest sources bias. embodies pseudoscience. can’t enforce it. Simple that.

Some people can’t wear medical reasons. sort information privileged protected yeah, can’t force people wear can’t fine not.

Stores n whatnot refuse service, jobs require it, state require licensed businesses, state really can’t anything average citizen. Good, finally critical comment instead downvote

Was entire prison population ""infected"" ""concerned""?

Why say ""perpetuated fear""?
The article says guy started watchin Fox CNN, source inmates appear inspected get information virus. locked somewhere watching corona news running non-stop, likely would get close panic attack.
Globally speaking, something people world still do. people trust TV news much simply want understand differing opinions try internet especially youtube, critical experts shut immediately, temporarily. experts *too* rarely get TV air time.

Thus, would good know one could conclude sort fear-mongering happening. 

People dying, yes, also die partially dramatic measures:

""The “second wave” already breaking. made non-coronavirus patients able willing access healthcare crisis. Based ONS NHS data, Edge Health estimates deaths total approximately 10,000 running around 2,000 

Are 100% sure whether global corona-measures beneficial far? 



Sources YouTube deleting counter-opinions fact news makes wanna disappear. Don’t wear mask. wear masks. couldn’t say wear mask shortage. 

Needs consistent keep trust. Without dumb nuts coming bro science. It’s odd sub fix bias? I'll move Putin country."
