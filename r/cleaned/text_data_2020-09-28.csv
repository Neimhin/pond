0,2020-09-28," government may weak US best many areas including research science, technology critical thinking. Calling Singapore democratic stretch... also depends long side effects actually last. probably dr. fauci doesnt change opinion every week agree it’s ridiculous open I’m saying since they’re getting help “government “ need live make $ wish things different. they’re not. We’ve failed foiled pay bills? Feed kids? It’s fucked up. clearly getting hard hit reaches rest Europe impact careful Italy now. 

The question last ? quiet moment storm ? I'm always unnerved many people automatically put seatbelt get car (pre-covid). car screams do, happens maybe half time? Could visited Russia? /s one peer reviewed FYI. Again, however, medical community divided. consensus handle virus. 35 million people US July. That's lot going medical costs life long productivity losses.  Neat! What’s that? thought fit description. deep lock since thing began, I'm putting life risk. 

The CDC changing guidance based white house conspiracy theory.

I take vaccines. Saturday, got drive-thru flu shot. normally get flu shots, prior jobs made resented it. year, got one putting feelings aside community.

I never said I'm getting vaccinated. part made up. said I'm using critical thinking equation. 

I'm hoping get semblance normalcy vaccine available. would like go shopping stores again. would like see touch friends again.

But since CDC compromised, look scientific community guidance vaccine safety. Likely one choice. Using critical thinking decision bad thing, put risk, make anti-vaxxer. Florida needs it’s sales tax hotel tax, car rental tax, condo rental tax, TOURISM keeps boat float there. Along drug running, prostitution, money laundering, extortion etc. Case fatality rate simply reported deaths/reported cases. mostly meaningless want compare deadly two countries certainly mean many percent infected die. could never dreamed it, China did. So? seem learnt mistakes important thing. Daily cases gone since lockdown eased far clear second wave. Unlike say UK daily cases rate higher peak lockdown (with caveat people tested).

Daily deaths Italy fairly stable since July well. Oh cute, think shaming instead showing upset called out. one cares do. educate surviving COVID like. like magically better, unless mild case traumatic affair long term complications. ""you live die."" American trash. Governor wants attention daddy, aka Mr. $750, anything it. insane gets upvoted. Australia hard local lockdown, night curfews, able leave home specific reasons specific times, interstate travel.. Great job, definitely masks usual prevention measures. 

I understand people upvote it: makes masks look good. long run, people realize quite bit masks usual prevention measures, ""lying good cause"" work. 

Masks help. That's enough. necessary claim do. FL early in-person voting. I've voted sometimes weeks elections. people vote election day people waited till last minute. Exactly, that's I've telling people. ""Yeah, entire world would crash world economy, kill 1 million people American presidential election. entire world revolves around America. suggest begin think bit critically"". I've stopped concerned stupid people's feelings. understanding statistics poor understand basics data sampling sure point conversation you. sample 10,000 people properly results apply entirety India greater 90% accuracy, never mind individual cities. Take me, feel free look things up.

It seems like local lockdowns needed CG say true. major cities like Mumbai, Kolkata admissions going despite open. Oxygen certainly supply issue sure, people hoarding well related actual statistics cases. know make front page screengrab r/ConfidentlyIncorrect name gets blurred don’t get karma, right? realize every country planet pandemic, too, don’t care election, right? Either way lean, consistently suppression information. Sounds like 0.052% average amount brain cells even legal California time? never really shut down.

I go restaurants often, day day life. Going work, shopping, on. masks know anything going on. daily life impacted since whole thing began. 

People keep talking Florida ""reopening"". Palm Beach County, hardly closed. 

I always wonder actually shut down, would numbers been? same? Higher, lower?  Although car transmission virus transmission rate maybe clear cut. do. stated it. pretended ""swing miss"" rather admit uninformed spreading propaganda. really think projecting survey data 20-30k people back drop millions people ( 20million Delhi, 19million, 3 million Pune, 6 million Ahmedabad) meaningful either. 

Hospital admission still increasing state(CG) number deaths. ICU beds completely filled, people dying get oxygen time. still happening. isn’t Spain whole, instead Madrid. take wild guess way government Madrid leans... People manage stress different ways includes eating less exercise. Lots friends home time exercise cook rather commuting eating take away third wave? second. feel like whole year one constant wave. state conducting 12 city, 12 day study/observation many people wearing seat belts. annually and... Surprise, last 3 years, percentage dropped.  
Want take stab causation correlation drop since 2017?? Feels. We're living best life get told we're wrong. Yesterday reported cases dropped 69,000 usual 80,000+, deaths 777 usual 1,000-1,100. guess somebody forgot tell officials tasked fudging numbers deaths supposed drop weeks infections, day. That's fascism tho, can't vote fascists definition

I think far better term would authoritarian regime real? really don’t know? case numbers fudged nationwide act desperation mean predominantly black countries, although I'm sure black people around world aware what's done long time recently black people parts world take consideration. best response always ""Yeah, entire world would crash world economy, kill 1 million people American presidential election. Please pause moment think critically once"". I've stopped giving fuck stupid people's feelings. ally debate people claim flu comparable car HIV! work like team defend viewpoint! Another good reference point: 2015, around 57 million people died worldwide. Announce plenty warning people buy stuff. Limit amounts things person buy per day, hoarding.

I worked grocery store toilet paper shortage. tell 100% certainty nobody going respect sign posted quantity limit, people handing limited items get security kind enforce it. country 150million starving malnourished people... I'm sure give fuck supporting international inspectors tell cant eat. kind thing happening whole time?  Bavaria it’s pretty chill well. Everything open except pure bars (no food) clubs. realize must suck bar/club owners people life pretty much back normal. Sure, mandatory masks stores public transport seriously, wearing mask non-issue don’t even count that. Trump government horrible corrupt. Worst ever! agree lol Serological studies suggest could many cases daily early June we're catching we're able test more. number may meaningful.

Hospital admissions seem increasing, yes, would definitely say plateau. Greed arrogance all. Possible long term covid. may symptomatic weeks ago. erased effects felt maybe forever. Sorry champ. Oh going parade? Parades pandemics historic data /s R.I.P America  Precisely. East got initial hit like ""YO! South! Maybe use us example?? used Italy example. you...wait what? Wait doing? Oh shit. Yo..stop shit, yo. Yo. Fuck. Hey...hey...fuck. Stop. Oh...okay...you're gonna keep that? Oh. Well...I...we...I...okay. Well...bye?"" watched refrigerator trucks pulling hospitals used makeshift morgues. saw hospitals flooding. Shit cooled unified effort. 

My theory though...is started happen, morons shocked went homes locked because...well...we struck first didnt time react. rest country's morons plenty time research bullshit conspiracy, listen God Emperor Daddy build narrative hit plenty time decide bullshit instead instant potential belief. Even dumbest Trumpetters know wearing masks here. Not..well. disregard efficacy. Rest country plenty time decide wearing masks staying indoors helped Lizard People Hillary's agenda hostile coup. Rumor it...the coronavirus offspring Clinton first husband... Satan. Makes sense. reckon absolutely right there! still know virus came from. idea actuary came bat unproven evidence cases predate wuhan, likely originate wuhan wet market.

It would beneficial limit things lead contact animals general. Like deforestation. 95k+ cases daily plateau reached guess?  me, difference Italy Spain first time around. countries we're unprepared, virus went unnoticed long time, suddenly death wave came along overcrowded hospitals. images we've seen especially coming Lombardy (but also Spain) stark motivators avoid situation second time. 

The thing assume Italians saw horror decided act according government recommends. Spain, feel government still understanding seriousness situation tries balance economy, tourism, healthcare triangle. incertitude reflected population see difference second wave. “those countries” mean literally entire world? I'm curious bc premise 20% herd immunity limit bar immunity lower 60-70% initial estimate, *if* people behaving sufficient caution.

I suspect people started let guard down, article points schools/colleges opening Labor day activities. follow podcasters NY, recent episodes, started in-person guests months zoom recording even hosts (I know anecdotal). lax behavior, prevalence would closer initial estimate 60-70% herd immunity unfortunately. pandemic stay United States showing us happen everywhere else world.

No country money provide stimulus checks years. Even Canada still sure program replace one ending September...

In 6 months way country use USA playbook, mark words. So, exactly explicitly thanking China for? Spain sounding like USSR Keep em locked til Xmas. uncle could survive 3 years Japanese pow camp, I’m sure could survive 4 months halls residence. saying. article two months old dude. It’s aging badly phone actually creaked. Two months ancient news data topic. said. didn’t say policy makers citizens. Seems like combination btw. Yesh bit overly sensitive. Maybe save energy engaging policy makers. already happened days ago. Well, *months* ago, one looks real deaths. Also times tried put clear message blocked political reasons. Halifax beautiful city. far major city population less 500k. good point, yes youngest got last year, one trip one bit later :)  stop testing go away.

- POTUS Nope! live PA haha Damn that's worth almost 5 ft CVS receipt paper, that's good deal  honestly useful. scientists need predict likely strain/s are, dependent predicting correct one, vaccine effective it.

Because uncertain, vaccine tends actually help people. less strains, would less issue. 

Not everyone justify cost (even $75 per person family expensive), taking time work schools accessible 5pm weekends, able get place provides them.

Its useful say, teacher exposed hundreds children time, work 4-5 people like 3 friends, may lot less priority. sad thread think consider possible outcome,

Rene work well. Well comparable say virus car. one talking first confirmed cases arose wherefrom. Swing n miss!! 4 makes circle Trump enters chat good tool well. sorts data world well individual US states, either raw normalized population, daily/weekly/total stats, test positivity rates much more. maybe even Lead Zeppelin. Source?

Initial tests 30% false positive. better now. ""middle class"" (too many people incorrectly label middle still working class) manipulated vote interests ""temporarily embarrassed millionaires"". let them. People US pay treatment anyway  lot thing know virus. Spain one restrictive lockdowns world, deep shit again. Sweden light restrictions much better. real reason illegal immigration fixed USA:

It's modern day cheap slave labor. Illegals can't complain bad conditions are, bye bye, lucrative books income you! well documented general number issues exacerbated flu season... credible expert found loudly saying need flu shots specifically known dangers poses midst pandemic likelihood drive dramatic increase serious symptoms.

Unfortunately, problem usual significant portion population allowed hyper partisan tribal identity morph worldview distinctly anti-science filter.

Not surprisingly, people making stories auto-intoxification mask use, denying well documented parallels outbreaks, ignoring repeated studies showing hydroxychloronique kills, claiming child infections pose risk ones think know better spent lives studying infectious diseases saying flu vaccine helpful.

So long agenda driven anti-science policy continues pushed top, anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers, amd gaslit masses continue dragging us them. Death COVID rare children. child severe health issues, need cautious, otherwise, kids unlikely severe complications. Well contagiousness related mutation Europe supposedly. simple Google search these. find several articles facts thing said.  Exactly. think like seasonal go away. Fuckers stopped wearing masks gloves likely like 3 9/11s worth deaths yesterday. wait two weeks we'll see reflected numbers. symptoms could also anxiety. would worth getting checked doctor case something serious. covid thing mean need delay medical care. Delaying could mean treatable condition harder fix. anxiety, also treatable. take daily anti-anxiety medication I'm normal person. shame it. hope everything turns okay you. rate rate 4%.

Your data points bad. USA worse agree u part, hunting order eat risky, no? filled errors unsupported claims. upvoted? 

Where source fact virus mutations behind mild vs ”severely deadly” cases? mutations cause weird side effects (I trouble understanding you’re getting here)? 

This virus mutates like viruses, yes, mutates lesser degree than, say, influenza. far, mutations seen SARS-COV-2 seen alter functionality virus. ones actually shown differ differed *very* slightly. 

There evidence whatsoever scientists ”fighting 10 different variants instead 1” point. 

Your ”solution” also complete nonsense, serious expert advocated it. would cause massive, irreversible damage society, would also amount nothing, virus like basically impossible eradicate. would need vaccine infection rate 0, btw? dying empire current experiencing it’s death throws already given up. Betsy Devos pleased chose force children attend in-person school Neat! Questions you, person wanting see family there, sec:

Really hoping see folks Christmas jump reliable info. Thanks! say underweight doctor says that's one reasons may affected intensely, may want mention undereating well concerned weight diet. I'm long hauler dealing symptoms since march. I'm huge fan Trump either, c'mon, ""telling"" everyone wear mask hang together, responsibility ends falling citizens actually comply. let people burn buildings throw rocks cops last months, actually thinks government would/could enforce sheltering and/or mask rules. People went partying ignored suggestions cases orders, gather together. people, president.

My county mask orders. Tons folks comply. read today super spreading events parties. Pandemics spread people's behavior, government. Check Sweden. hardly ordered anyone anything, government suggested certain actions people complied part. That's difference countries us....people Asia wore masks this, people China know they'll get shot disobey. gonna shoot people make stay home? really need police handle non violent situation? need defund police send unarmed civil servant unit handle situations like this.

Remember told need masks spring? trust ""you can't get surfaces"" either Opening 100% even going work problem. Look happened movie theaters tried release new blockbuster last month. people avoiding risk own, matter much noise anti-mask anti-lockdown crowd makes.

Any business relies large, maskless gatherings (especially indoors) trouble matter much DeSantis bloviates. way save properly control virus months ago. don’t get article. starts emphasizing surface contact rare way get infected, goes say need regularly disinfect high touch surfaces, wash hands least 20 seconds handling package, wear gloves laundry infected person home.

FYI, peer reviewed. even see reviewer said Nature papers (check ""Peer review file""). want say opinions based ""actual science"", maybe first understand works. fun still think knew better say that, get point. course, masks 100% effective. That's healthcare workers still dying virus day. However, healthcare worker properly equipped still greater chance a) avoiding virus b) getting high viral load exposure. expect government able guarantee natural phenomenon like virus outbreak stop issue? I’m glad you’re feeling better. must’ve scary. That’s nonsense. March entire country shut month. Never trusted Dr Birx simply true. exactly problem. US enough handle giving temporary UBI everyone, never did, hellbent idea making people choose bankruptcy sickness. many people, going back work mean sickness death, Trump administration Senate care one whit. administration directly interfered communications coming FDA he's said may bypass current vaccine regulations. I'm sure politicization. neo-feudalist? family Florida, never heard described such! Sounds interesting horrifying lol “scientists” saying we’d 2million deaths. got march hav dealt six months now. thought long haul symptoms week..... almost passed walking kitchen yesterday. sit floor could get back up. Symptoms come waves time (one week fine, next i'll nearly bedridden)  *hygiene theater Maybe owns bunch mortuaries smuggles drugs using bodies. Wait, that's plot Bad Boys 2 CEO company ardent Trump fanboy, &amp; known liar. made claims years pillows could cure whole host ridiculous things, &amp; then, midst Pandemic, went &amp; ""cure"" Oleadrin (an unproven &amp; potentially toxic extract poisonous Oleander plant), touted media, citing ""a study"" never producing it. Shocker: he's Board company produces it. He's grifter. KiLlS ElDeRlY.!! one spreading propaganda. restrictions recommendations, still place, tougher many countries post-lockdowns. 

And no, Denmark (and world) ministerial governance, Sweden not. 
But sure, looking around world, several countries seems bend constitutional laws, sense possible.

About herd immunity, look up. would recommendations, restrictions instances protecting old case? emails? discussion colleagues common subject within field epidemiology taboo? Like carpenter discussion gonna build roof. mention schools closed 16 years+, even though it, decided go for. 

And herd immunity, mean rest least Europe going now? Since many lighter restrictions Sweden wont lock again. initial lockdown = herd immunity? read article, proves nothing. One first things taught grad school exercise caution citing sources newspaper magazine. could information inaccurate, may bias reporter. example, ""that suggests official death counts may substantially underestimating overall effects virus, people die virus well causes linked pandemic."" 

Another statement: ""Even adjustment, it’s possible could underestimate complete death toll increased mortality causing states lag past states changed reporting systems.""

Sure, there's possibility deaths may underreported. there's proof. Relying NYT instead peer-reviewed journal article big mistake.

Back original point. Yes, prevention best option handle COVID. U.S. higher infection rate. No-one denying that. However, death rate fallen quite time. Even account possible lag reporting, death rate still much lower previous months. 

Identifying death rate falling extremely useful. could cause death rate fall even more. Short vaccine, next best option keep death rate low possible. really think unimportant learn less people dying?

I'll give another example: HIV. Obviously, best means prevent infection first place. Still, someone infected, next course option treatment. Like COVID, HIV death rate fallen. fact, someone infected HIV 2020 far greater chance survival someone infected 1980. Yes, prevention best means. never good ignore people surviving COVID, HIV virus. people don’t care. tired fear, anxiety, lack relaxation, fun, socialization. 


I’ll follow business rules that’s choice implement them. 

But want go life. things want do. I’ll best stay away you.

People need determine risk take appropriate actions. Eat rich. like stay still possible. It’s ok, election soon back normal, elected officials worried getting side elected. Term limits anyone? explain countries lauded suffering now. Yep that’s me:( CDC all-knowing all-powerful Hollywood. Nothing more. Yeah, think that’s joke. Non - American here.. ""snowbirds"" usually retired, therefore pay income tax? retired people pay income tax pensions?? Wierd always mid 2021, could lot closer normal life US actually done lockdown. idea lockdown hard 6-8 weeks, slowly reopen everyone wearing masks getting tested contain outbreaks. US done - effectively still step 1. Oh going around. spend time underbellies internet hear line pretty regularly. They're also *still* pushing ""car crash"" narratives saying shit like ""only 12,000 actual deaths.""

They're literal sheep. parrot disinformation lies concern reality. insanity. False! Seat belts common sense, pants optional work home! get saying, obviously could redefine ""stuck it"" mean whatever want always win argument. disaster. I'm avid NYCC-goer go every single year could IMAGINE going year -and that's without even needing significant travel stay hotel, live quite close-. we're starting see upticks states made good strides case numbers second wave starts (New York seeing highest infection rate since July)...but several states even finished first wave, still possibly months second....just time travel LA go Comic Con, assure you, plenty Southern states, even ones hit hard, still think 'fake news' thing, taking seriously, refuse wear masks, going travelling every weekend.  


It's wildly unfair people giving much try beat this, people done caring want 'normalcy' rushing whatever want setting everyone back. like 2 steps forward, 10 backward. wrong. know likely made jump animal human around third week November. first victims wet market. Wet markets notorious breeding grounds viruses city 11 million animals mixing together unsanitary conditions. 

Deforestation never caused pandemic know talking about. Fatigue also brought depression brought massive hospital bills. course, sense, COVID caused depression too. Nothing new though. Florida terrible. They've lying whole time. smart special think cronyism, capitalism. capital markets textbook command economy, free market. Everything flows them. capitalism, never would able get leveraged bad debt would cleared long ago.  Gotta get R votes.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything normal, get vote true, vaccines late stage trials currently produced millions anticipation approval FDA. Distribution still take definitely head start production Please describe safety nets. Saying make so. honestly dread winter Berlin. know thing makes city bearable winter parties raves (majority city thinks too) haven’t really last months outside open air private stuff. winter? way people going mingle, let alone wear masks that. government plenty time something failed fear winter gonna bad. maybe not, knows. Trump mimic nations control. precisely opposite, 130,000 Americans died could easily prevented. 

This POS getting away it. didnt lie. significant number studies mask efficacy viral infections COVId even existed, generally tested influenza. likely pointing those.

Those studies show almost negligible difference preventing transmission Healthcare workers infected, *when worker wearing mask*.

Masks better source control, infected wearing it, studies confirm well. Though also somewhat minor. 

The difference context study applied. studies surround efficacy masks Healthcare settings individuals regularly close contact interacting infection elements.

A mask save case consistent basis. see many organizations claiming out-right will.

But mask help general public they're following distancing guidelines, mask decrease level accidental aerosol transmission. 

If distancing, mask gonna shit long term. 

So lying, different contexts mask usage data they'd show it.


Also, bigger reason masks recommended less efficacy problem trust people use masks correctly without accidentally contaminating PPE scratching nose moving getting fingers infection element inside thr mask inadvertently, etc etc.

Just info changed mean lied to. WHO, CDC, country gov'ts tended flip script approximately time frame masks. would difficult make coordinated lie countries reality ""hey, new info helpful, also far beyond containing *have* rely general public help mitigate thing, every possible avenue helps, including potential risks masks"".


And last bit precisely get people saying masks bad. latch valid potential risks make potential risks sound like crux critical info masks think people kept from, reality like health organizations aware risks still think good idea compared alternative. ... experience Australia, kind need least months done properly, 15 days nowhere near enough. believe true. yesterday revealed double number teens infected compared younger children Trump administration pushed hide data CDC shows schools re-opening. grown-up world, alarming, *lot* people even pay attention, choosing believe everything fine. Purge think everyone else over-complicating converation. went ""the way world *not*"" ""the way want world work"". 

One guy saying need job health safety, another guy saying need that, neither wrong. They're two different conversations. terrifying. manage internally them, need modernise. fines citizens would international sanctions would damage economy.   ""We plenty evidence isn’t possible. Like 4 human coronaviruses instance. 100+ viruses cause common cold.""

There one. pretty heavily voted might missed others responded to. could easily petition president congress relief

Because President Congress caring understanding lately...

What makes think would chance working? Time hoard toilet paper. gonna surprised find significant proportion flordia population snowbirds retires, “inbred hillbillies”. know people now. barely sick 100% recovered. one died 60+ already obese bad health. yeah, call crazy scared anymore would left handed people hijack that? zip codes include several Orthodox Jewish communities, officials said resisted mask-wearing. 

Can confirm, bosses Orthodox Jewish don’t think either one even mask. There's nothing wrong level wages provided they're work earn it.  Lots overtime, complicated tasks, like.  $100k year benefits really average salary.

Also, Cuomo blue leadership presented repeatedly seroprevelance. really ""right wing"" talking point.

I read sub lot, I've never, ever seen anybody say that. Sure. possible. association mind already. really common knowledge vaccines take time work Yeah opinion lose-lose situation matter option go with. Yeah, looks much cooler. 

So exactly equivalent. Let's real here, kids dont need vaccinated. 

If vaccinate everyone kids, really drop amount deaths, since Covid really serious children, able get kids back school. 

During regular flu season, deaths kids teens ranges 37-188. Since Covid started March, 100 kids died covid. well within range typical flu season.  favorite player gets hit Corona ends career. 

All well though, long got pre-game jollies, right? would help? would breathing moisture outside masks... thats case herd immunity minimuym 56% expect least another 150k-300k deaths depending handled. 

if 70% expect least 300k-600k depending handled...

I cannot believe administration willing sign death warrants many people... Luckily developed world, poor/rural areas tend less densely populated hence less risk spread general. It'll okay rollout slower there.

The less developed world problems this.

Of course, FDA pressure, politically, even called “deep state” supposedly trying slow things down. full confidence ability override pressure?

Yes. public servants proven integrity decades. I’m sure part, particularly staff. Right now, FDA renowned world scientific expertise.

This experience roller coaster everybody — certainly you. advice would give people based you’ve learned?

The fundamental message driven purpose, know ultimate goal success deliver promise give society — Pfizer’s purpose, “breakthroughs change patients’ lives” — can’t think breakthrough change people’s lives vaccine covid right now. drove decisions. And, frankly, investors, applaud that. board. Pfizer want, Pfizer science, Pfizer liked society. message things unprecedented confused, compass purpose.

KK Ottesen regular contributor magazine. Follow Twitter: @kkOttesen. interview edited condensed. benefit getting fine wearing mask, duh Albert Bourla, 58, chairman chief executive Pfizer, multinational pharmaceutical company. Bourla doctor veterinary medicine began career Pfizer 27 years ago home country Greece.

The pressure high imagine. It’s easy thing feel hopes billions people millions businesses hundreds governments invested industry — leading company industry, happens CEO. also new CEO. feel pressure shoulders. feel need rise occasion. moments needed glass wine — let put way.

What stake beyond imagination. global economy we’re paralyzed. health whole planet pandemic haven’t seen hundred years. There’s lot stake. then, make even worse, also political debate, shouldn’t [be]. also creates unique situation. need make sure navigate — still able deliver world hope deliver: solution.

What exciting moments along way, moments hope?

Yes, multiple moments. moment received call, told me, “Check email. sent first clinical data.” [the data] good. ecstatic. But, need know, endeavor, good news, usually don’t last long. Maybe hour. [Laughs.] moments joy see it’s happening, God.

In order develop covid-19 vaccine unprecedentedly short — and, initially said, unrealistic — time frame, instructed researchers think different terms. talk little bit that, came thinking?

I came felt pressure discussed, right? felt that, don’t know, history placed role moment impact. needed play role. Usually, things sequentially otherwise become risky, expensive. don’t produce, don’t start manufacturing process, don’t order equipment, don’t order supplies, know something. that, course take year approval get product manufactured. told them: “Don’t think like that. Think parallel, sequentially.” told them: “This business usual. Open checkbook. it.” told later shocked. [Laughs.] next meeting everyone brought solutions.

I imagine accelerated timeline changes way think, way think, even possible.

Correct. think would pose question: covid, covid? can’t speed treatments cancer? can’t speed treatments Alzheimer’s Parkinson’s? think experience teach us lot things.

How think pricing [return investment] vaccine?

One is, much invest. open checkbook without even running models anything. Usually price something based value brings. stake trillions global economy, couldn’t price based that. also tried based demand, long period time demand always higher offer. suddenly 7 billion people want vaccine, can’t able manufacture it. basic principles, throw away.

And came felt, frankly, symbolic price. saw lowest vaccine range, flu vaccine. around $20, said: Okay, let’s put 19 1/2 U.S. Basically, that’s it. It’s science. philosophy. government give free, help giving government price lowest end. I’m going create access problem.

Big Pharma often vilified enormous profits earns — lauded one hand creating lifesaving medications criticized, other, reaping huge profits “human suffering.” think criticism industry whole fair?

I think it’s completely unfair. think also made mistakes, played role bringing this. believe U.S., particularly, problem patients unable pay contributions real. two distinct items here. One, much medicines cost health-care system; much medicines cost individual goes pharmacy buy medicine. first one around 12 percent total health-care cost — 12 percent. definition, cannot big problem. Right?

But bottom line people U.S., predominantly, trust medicines. don’t trust ones making them. that’s unfortunate. need change it. Like I’ve said multiple times, reputation lost buckets, earn back drops. think covid-19 become catalyst becoming clear society value industry bringing. don’t think ready declare victory. need lot things right way make sure restore, slowly, slowly, reputation needs be, best, highest contributor goods humanity.

In September, Pfizer one nine drug companies put letter pledging cut corners safety — waiting rigorous Phase 3 testing showed success bring FDA approval. FDA scientists also came public statement pledging same. That’s pretty unusual step take. discussion behind that? feel necessary?

Oh, different usual. felt discussions around medicines work happening right politicians journalists, instead scientists, need happen. people confused. Right now, don’t know believe believe. felt that, debate peaking, go say going stand science. make clear pressures, going honor legacy, going whatever takes deliver product safe effective. don’t reach level, even apply FDA.

Something like 35 percent people said might take vaccine everyone’s working hard develop. Obviously, people wary it’s new drug, long-term effects can’t known point. There’s anti-science sentiment right now, people hearing different things different political segments, unsure, said, believe.

I read polls, also speak people, see concerns. think problem [of] political debate; confuses people. need educate people things. everything needs transparent. think pledge helped.

The first priority trying figure vaccine. then, would see involved education process kind policy rolling out?

I would love to. think impactful [response] come independent scientists. People, confused. would easy someone, hear me, feel maybe self-interest. hear NIH, Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, prominent scientists, think it’s much believable.

You’ve said end October, Pfizer good chance know vaccine works not, you’re actually manufacturing vaccine, even it’s still undergoing trial, could ready soon receives FDA approval.

Yes. plan. Already October, hundreds thousands [of doses] ready. think go million November, many millions December.

I’m sure aware, even may try be, timeline upcoming election pressure current administration vaccine then, President Trump’s advisers calling vaccine election “the holy grail.” must think potential ramifications timing release. reminder shingles caused chickenpox decades chickenpox. I'm one hottest hot spots right hospital systems fine, people returning back work, people beginning hang again. Nursing homes, assisted living facilities areas vulnerable populations remain stricter visitation criteria otherwise everything going back normal resulting mass deaths earlier predicted. two greatest factors preventing pandemics, 1) density population, 2) density population. Ok, we’ll see do. Less pho, bulgogi. Got it! Great news! needed said? collapse sales tax revenue simply can't offset. could try raising sales taxes, since tourists coming in, would taxing constitutents (and sales taxes regressive, there's that).

Yes, would taxing constituents, like rest world DeSantis put position- 

Man self-inflicted problem says there's possible solution! I'm going lose sleep DeSantis put situation claimed there's nothing do. Sure, necessarily disagree there's nothing right now, maybe time remove since he's spent last 2 years governor putting us situation, 5 years house rep also spent time effort trying put us although looking NYC/SFO bankruptcy stats, unclear collapse could avoided better containment measures.

But world start end economy number bankruptcies. Nobody able completely avoid economic issues, global pandemic... many countries many states able things like enforce mask mandates, enforce social distancing, spend time work hospitals get better data rather hiding it, working unemployment clear state tax structure put DeSantis state Florida large, rock hard place. matter do, serious pain likely lies ahead.

And step 1 recalling replacing person helm still actively steering state toward pain. mean FFS opened everything basically restrictions, even put fucking executive order local counties cities can't make restrictive laws...


Like literally nothing would better, instead actively going way make sure local counties cities can't constituents... one completely avoidable.



So let's cut cancer clearly making state worse, replace someone actually run state, maybe years see positive impacts. picking prescription today damn pharmacist nose hanging out. Infuriating. correct! Same, remember I’m stuck wearing extra mask doesn’t nose piece cause wear glasses.  Anti pretty much agree you, however side arguement. believe vague benefits mask wearing early keep public buying limited amount masks available. makes sense medical professionals prioritized getting ppe first. believe alarming public take Covid seriously early would beneficial, also believe went way provide best outcome largest amount people. believe malicious honourable intent? Same. also wear glasses means excessive fog. People already got fined wearing nose. Truly stupid. go grocery store, exposure too. 

If groceries delivered, still exposure. 

I think past point completely isolating families like this. me, seems silly unless know they've exposed actual covid positive person.

Yeah, obesity comorbidity, virus also cause heart attacks strokes people peak health.

Yes, are. Complete rubbish, tired platitudes ""ministerial governance, corruption index"" ran out. words even yours, standard nonsensical playbook apologists. surprise continue stated facts.

Answer simple question now. part ""ministerial governance"" prohibits Swedish government building stockpiles, starting domestic manufacturing vital goods, recommend masks, close borders.

Very simple question, refuse answer ""ministerial governance"" *bullshit*. government could every single thing Denmark, Finland Norway did. way knowing either way. don’t know got it. suggest saying “mask up” beyond irrelevant comment based article. people hard time breathing wearing masks time. weird much disgusting nose look poking mask without mask experience opposite.

Back pandemic first starting, HEIGHT around me, asked coworkers, non-aggressive way, refused wear masks. Well even got point shunned while. reverse effect. 

Now, public would different outcome, yes. can’t see getting shunned asking someone public wear mask. But, imagine would happen person would tell F off. can’t show immediate consequences, people like laugh face forget ten minutes. People already covid themselves, suppose... Oh ffs, need ""experts"" say this? common sense, anyone half brain cell would fucking know. gives 💩 pubs. People view war type situation; comply stop bitching things. could worse. One could ventilator concentration camp. Ya’ll... last day gas station day man walked w/o mask. company policy mask service asked one, said no. explained policy. Magically mask appears pocket begrudgingly puts on.... CHIN. kinda give attitude goes “you said wear one, /how/“ !!! Needless say kicked lmfao.  Must joke poverty leads bad health lower life outcomes would result 150,000 deaths Turkey, assuming herd immunity 30%. 141,000 deaths top 8,130 deaths far. Swedish population finally get skulls shit aint working.

If population Sweden happy content current policies, cases, death rate, obviously working.

You might think dumb, since living Sweden, opinion count. different conversation sprung off.

There LARGE difference potential risk FDA communications politically slanted, FDA approval vaccine politically slanted. 

If saying concerned messaging, that’s reasonable. saying concerned safety vaccine, entirely unreasonable.

My complaint that, putting FDA questionable light without proper context specific person concern pushes others put trust FDA all, vaccine(s) approved. want avoid they're wearing masks, they're Jewish, moron. avoid ANYONE without much can.

Weddings (which I've seen) big gatherings socialize people wearing masks go protest systemic racism brutality, go ignorant shit, guess. Huh? Obese men even worse odds obese women. (Somehow, know posted sub before.) course also somewhat fault willingly maintaining risk factor. 100% right.
I comorbidities, healthy fit danger zone age. got covid nearly killed me. never stopped living. refuse sad, depressed, anxious. choose engage life every day. came close dying know feels
Like choose life  Except whole covering mouth part... saw least 3 people asda today (UK). Yes. believe still getting regular medical care including plenty unwanted cancer screenings. pandemic caused postpone single doctors appointment worst it. people really missing that.

Btw vaccines developed based platforms treating cancer, existing still development. like research done add progress cancer treatment development. you’d go now? fucking shit? It’s people trying absolute HARDEST wear mask time trying rebel follow rules minimum. 

This shit fucking infuriating. Yep. Keeping 80% salery calling sick makes lot easier follow recommendation stay home sick. it’s garbage. next question? literally complained Jews hogging sidewalks can’t avoid them. You’re
a bigot. Unnecessary gathering occurs something aligning ideology. You’re also hypocrite / cases * 100 = deathRate%

Global: 1,004,129 / 33,484,488 * 100 = 2.9988% 

US: 205,774 / 7,180,411 * 100 = 2.8658%

Seems pretty close 3% me.

BTW, Another way say US's death rate 2.86% ""1 35"". in, 1 35 people catch COVID die it. Curious stands scrutiny.   never told time syphilis

True. told ""bad blood,"" one could argue relevant, understood term amongst poor sharecroppers. agree, told Syphilis specifically 25 years treatment available, allowed develop late stage syphilis.

Right. study meant study treat them, treated medicine time, funding cut founder dropped out, allowed go without treatment decades, Penicillin discovered (which couple decades originally intended run ""treated"" essentially ineffective dangerous meds likely treated skin symptoms curative impact disease course. 

Yes, treat syphilis time! course, detract immorality letting go without treatment Penicillin discovered couple decades later. Countries 0 cases per 100k yellow reason Next day headline: entire Tennessee Titans entered concussion protocol. Maybe individuals take responsibility health? would prevented many deaths agree. now, walk people directly call out. It’s illegal wear mask inside closed public place city, use law encourage compliance. Yes did. 60 brilliant minds suggested wait, even though results likely going available October. efficacy data then, give people sort idea is/is working? last person receive second dose may happen October earliest would mean results wouldn’t available participants late Nov/December earliest. mask primarily protects people. I'm sure will. think agree would big mistake. 

Anyway, I'm Australian worry making decision Virtual Christmas. bought carton milk warns contains milk. There’s never evidence anything, is. yrs time found covid caused lung cancer something - you’d screaming didn’t lock government protected people. Covid complete unknown terms long term effects. I’m favour lock downs, pretending doesn’t exist can’t harm childish. Don’t cane street Singapore break law? calling unnecessary doubt security safety vaccines? isn’t reason suspicious vaccine, continue scare people, acting any. continuing perpetuate unnecessary concern. Fortunately, since aren’t one idiots refuse vaccine, PLEASE stop spreading conspiracy theories FDA, thus vaccine might compromised. seen many people jump already state won’t, stating “concerns” drives further.

I though apologize making assumptions. realize still causing harm. Like... point clearly I’m person planet concerns even people WITHIN FDA taking measures prevent interference. didn’t say wouldn’t get vaccine anyone else shouldn’t, expressed reasonable fucking concern. I’m glad it’s addressed. fulfill requirements wearing mask establishment entering, care wear mask first place. Ngl bugs ""experts:"" front text Disney enforcing masks FL.

Quit trying twist words. personal beliefs exclude wearing mask protect public health refraining unnecessary gatherings, matter are. agree let downvotes begin It’s it’s comfortable easier breathe, want prepared pull it’s appropriate.

Personally, wear mask time low risk settings - like I’m outside I’m really large indoor space nobody’s around. 

I’ll respectful wear mask properly I’m retail store, doctor’s office, etc. - I’m relatively high risk scenario people - it’s right thing know that. I’m definitely pro-mask. 

But mask isn’t preventative measure; it’s situational awareness + mask + intuition harm.

I get posts like reaction people without situational awareness intuition harm, posts also function way shame gatekeep people trying mask extent that’s reasonable given time given place. pandemic may officially Christmas, socially. virtual Christmas want. Others won’t Thank you. Scientific illiterate?

Do believe outdoor air immediately disintegrates SARS-CoV-2? makes zero sense. Common sense dictates definitely spread outdoors. 

The risk shown 12-40x lower, definitely zero. Mass gatherings still extremely risky, large outbreaks result. stating person put home, will, purpose stop spread something. think work? glass house? throw stones it? exponential growth every hard-hit country couple weeks beginning, clearly see death curves countries. stopped exponential - regardless respective governments decided - people idiots, small amounts distancing carefulness washing hands *a lot* curb spread. Mass distribution estimated capacity mid next year earliest. Lol I’m anti vaccine. I’m fully vaccinated kids, absolutely get vaccine passes phase 3 trial.

I’ve made 37 years, events year make clear can’t live here. people suck. government nightmarishly cruel. 

I want go live near family. prove ""water wet"". Ah mass gatherings okay long politics align yours?  parents, uncle went family outing county zoo. parents taking covid pretty seriously wore masks super carefully, really taking drinking water and/or really far away nearest person. uncle, hand, would walk around nose uncovered multiple occasions.

9 days later, uncle came covid parents fine. first mask handmade, used bread ties wire nope. that. know much effects, short longer term. know pretty easy contract.

they’re really people administering tests directly dealing covid patients. they’re great let cough sneeze, droplets get stopped face shield. pair surgical n95 mask you’re pretty much 100% protected.

It's invisible force actively trying stomp people out. nuts. LOL know mods tolerance anything negative China right? deflecting.

You made assertion, either 1) show proof or
2) admit actually know, assumption based biases prior knowledge (or lack thereof).

Unless provide 1 proceed 2.

But moving tangentially. 

You stated accept someone medical issue leading unwanted weight gain blamed prolonged side effects Covid-19.

Do consider mental health medical issue? would good option. Vietnam done fantastic job containing COVID. Canada deaths every week.. got aversion watching bother anymore mean say true cases increasing? mean that. 1 million nothing compared diseases tragedies people die every day around globe. Self directed lol. cannot police ourselves. many people care. needs forced one. could also struck lighting, meteor, assaulted escaped zoo animal. ""mark covid death""? told it? marked it? Ok, well then.. Vietnam? much hope. got politics clear minded arguments. truly surprised even debate president not. last 2 years woken lot. America fucked up. dumbest headline I've seen week. dude, go outside. keep distance, get vitamin d, go take fucking walk. Imagine average someone completely new virus infects 2 people virus. reproductive rate based various parameters - mostly physical characteristics virus many/how vulnerable people infection. Initially virus explodes exponentially 1 infects 2, 2 infect 4, etc... Say population 10,000 people it.

Some time passes 5000 10000 people contracted virus immune. Without changes characteristics virus, reproductive rate drop 2 (initially) 1, factors remaining equal. That's because, average, 1 2 people would infected immune. 6000 people immune, reproductive rate drops 0.8, virus begin die longer reproduce quickly enough maintain positive growth. Think wildfire runs trees burn. 

As virus dies out, lucky people population (some remaining 4000) avoided virus without actually exposed it. That's natural herd immunity, really sure many comments pretending myth relatively simple intuitive math. problem requires large amount exposures used strategy, generally try douse wildfires instead letting burn forest ground, even though latter definitely works. least cool cancelation email: ""We joking!"" hail glorious CCP Deaths trail cases weeks. think main concern something bad going lot people’s hearts get covid don’t fully understand long-term data on. study even remotely true.

That true, orthodox ppl clean all. gather close quarters prayer 3 times day. kiss prayer books, doorposts, Torah, clothing (tzitzit). They're constantly shaking hands. Self-hygiene exactly mitzvah. special clothing reused almost daily without cleaned (tzitzit, talis, tefillin).

Letting R go back natural level around 5 would bring us right quick Spanish Flu level carnage. Fortunately, looks like keep R around 0.9-1.2 vaccine restoring normalcy lives year now.

According John's Hopkins, quite happened yet, it'll happen within next week so. much think running restaurant costs gvt give owners check every month love know think going Makes sense part immune system vulnerability severe disease would X-linked. lots recessive sex-linked genes cause problems males. Yes, people started using Yahoo en masse Marissa Mayer got reason got $200m exit package driving company ground. people use YouTube GMail reason one execs offered $250m exit package disappear sexual assault allegations levied him. Case case case executives rewarded several hundred average American salaries dismal failure. Effective tax rates fraction average American pays.

You fellow rightwing nutjobs act like liberals childish understanding capitalism, really clue. thought inspid little example even moment would realize make goddamn bit sense; even within hyper-successful companies, there's vast divergence executives even upper management, continuing grow historic rates. design.

I'm saying, ""screw rich,"" I'm saying, ""the rich stop fucking us."" another person thinks they're going millionaire one days hard work. ever are, it'll shortly die, likely primarily attributable hyperinflation.

If want condescend, maybe develop less childish viewpoint. even allowed?  Bingo. listening Florida! ^^^^^^ It’s state? must think like odometer. gets high enough, it'll roll back zerp See real lockdown early? early March, people predicting 1.5-3 million deaths US end year. think that's referring I’m sure it’s debate tomorrow Also, lockdowns destroyed economy, virus. Ya think? Man stop embarassing yourself. I've Florida. whole state sucks. Recession inevitable regardless elected November.

Whether dollar valuable toilet paper depends Trump Biden. Trump toilet paper. Biden light end tunnel.

Assuming Trump even gives power when/if loses taxed all. married, $23 million. Foreign entities $6.78tn total $26.5tn - around quarter. rest owned US government agencies (e.g. social security trust), individuals, pension funds, states, etc.

So yes person replied wrong say ""relatively little"", point huge pool money invested US federal government debt. owners could also lend states, makes contention ""states can't borrow foreign governments therefore can't run deficits"" faulty logic.  country. zooming neighborhood made pop up, thanks. city live reports independently four counties resided -- like every damn map -- show city boundaries data. usually mean info includes county data making MUCH lower reality since excludes 11k cases city. Yeah seen middle first wave yet. rumor year's flu vaccine secretly wide spread COVID vaccine testing. I've heard folks every race, even folks work medical field. us listening. annual family Thanksgiving house year time, cancelled. happening year. people could easily tend mental health everyone would it. easy many people may you.   laws based ""I know see it""? I'm ok peer review. Led Zeppelin Well yeah, lie bunch idiots masks useful, try get idiots comply mask orders. Reap sow Extremely rigorous conditions met release vaccines, need documented. corrupt FDA enough affect vaccines, Trump would overturn policies laws would create much stir would aware them. Oh get trying say man... Perhaps hard time believing anybody stupid, kind endgame here? Rid Florida elderly, something? know actually quantifiable. Thank you. Saw Dr Atlas Fox News. mentioned CDC numbers showed ER visits Covid patients low. cases go open ER visits go stay steady, mean dealing virus better although cases, manageable? Lol no. “we hope u stay home” order gave people 1200 6 months.

I said open slowly, increase testing, tracing, etc. mandatory masks. responsible numbers don’t get control. easily done people could stop babies it. people keep saying coronavirus kill anyone already underlying condition. one thing seems good causing a, several, chronic underlying condition previously healthy people. already think virus overblown people hysterical never convinced. current administration amount wishful thinking make so. Without getting overly political, since sub that, would say 'American Superiority' frequently touted. Part fiercely individual nature selfish end using look issues directly impact them. see endless politicians public persons suddenly made 180 turn ideals family member touched. 

The US massive. that, we're like worst family ever - constantly fighting Billy side Jane took toy - normally tends adults room ensure even fighting, one gets really seriously hurt. adults right jello shots reason there's horse loose hospital. 

The majority people hope right ship state. be, also means people get involved, one challenge absolutely terrible at. It’s arguable impact reaction, condition Exactly. wrong. mostly borrows public retirement funds foreign entities. Foreign $6.78 Trillion US debt, $2.37 Trillion owned individuals (along banks, corporate non-corporate businesses). sad people know tend mental health without spreading deadly virus. Sounds like Susan Collins. guy courage. putz. also gave family Naples. Fuck Florida. idiots continue risk lives let risk it. Darwin wants words them.  ICMR's sero survey infection estimated 6.4 million April. Restricting movement pointless anyway, case part country seen virus. live Bangalore clusters cases moving outward, towards extremities city centre. Maharashtra also seeing trend. still gotten ur gotcha moment :/

Maybe busy worrying gotcha moment realize trying establish baseline beliefs something relate to.

Here's piece advice: Stop redditor 5 seconds actually read discuss things. National debt irrelevant long tank value currency. since US bully bomb shit anybody dares threaten USD’s status World Banks primary reserve currency we’ll fine Good job. Hydrochloric acid, or...? take seriously. India 

Totally unrelated always find fascinating figure someone based idiosyncratic English.

Does Australia use type thing? British isles India? guessed it! 👍🏻 We've already seen worst virus do. surprises left. around 1000 deaths/day another 6 months we'll get vaccinated. worst already way behind us. Florida: winners Stanley Cup Corona Cup.  religion though. people believe think govt conspiracy something like that. Good way shit get way control put bunch innocent impoverished laborers line fire Mother nature decided population control needed?  protests outdoors, almost everyone wore masks. None protests linked subsequent outbreaks. hand, Tulsa Trump rally tied subsequent outbreak Oklahoma. None looks great. Vaccine isnt looking good year, I'd sold even was. Herd immunity stupid, knew that.


What do? clearly don’t live understand doner state is... (I’m NJ. state deficit 20 billion they’ve given federal taxes. Jersey gets back 70 cents every dollar given (1) there’s many people (2) there’s much wealth, especially cities. Jersey states gets help basically supports rural America. Including rural Florida. You’re welcome! Florida doesn’t go deficit paying federal taxes) 

These federal taxes used help country run: fund schools Alabama, help pay fema emergencies, build federal highways, pay scholarships grants, build public hospitals...

This jersey state taxes high. Now, really don’t mind letting rural places economies drown die, want expand wealth gap lower access equal opportunities, sure! Abolish state taxes populated states - happen democratic, watch cities Wall Street go debt paying federal taxes, male country millionaires playground like Florida! 

Nj way better live Florida... schools, community, free events season. thanks state taxes. 

Nothing ever free already-paid Florida.... ever. 

And way opportunity north career... ironic since it’s basically surviving state taxes since gets federal help. 

I’ll also add people moving Florida (1) tax dodging millionaires hate paying rural America wanna complain point you’d think they’re taxed millionaires billionaires around dinner table don’t vote tax-dodging interests (FYI: they’re not... they’re still millionaires billionaires...), (2) YOLO partiers - alcohol and/or drugs, (3) anti-intellectualists despise higher education, (4) anti-masker, dehumanizing-fake-Christians, (5) hoping-to-shoot-someone conservatives. I’ve noticed since moving north... 

Enjoy you’re blood-thirsty, our-for-themself, apathetic, tax dodging partiers... confidently say country isn’t going follow suit Florida. Florida works successful it’s getting worse. considered socialism? concerning restaurants open seeing 50% new cases involve someone ate restaurant within last two weeks. pull child school today. went back person last week. masks kids. Teachers took masks classrooms taught without them. principal vice principal walk around unmasked. state mandate anyway. wrote letters principal told lack masks everyone private medical exemptions. pushed told wasn’t job enforce rules. 
So, today child lost access good education sake health, sacrifice partisan science denying politics. I’m angry. Sure, person president *and* person recommending people take wrong drugs *and* person setting political appointees censor scientists doctors, measure would make sense.

However, different president things. *this* president things. *this* president history fraudulent businesses, ripping suppliers, fomenting racial hatred, treating trade policy opportunity buddies make buck. worst part Florida choosing herd immunity route Florida, whole nation. Tourists visit, party huge crowds, get covid, return states spread it. folks folks quarantine get back. America bad! Yep, guys north hide ages. duh Nah Ronny DeathSentence ain't sharpest crayon box Off-topic “holidaymaker” do? sorry! wife son live fact brought virus home put wife's family risk. 

I hope parents spared wife suffer badly. 10 Mondays since July 5th higher death totals zoom way see countries whole. thought thing zoomed location. mean economy bounce back asphyxiate within inch life? Publicly funded healthcare. 
This Canadian hospital. 
Not profit. Damn man. Florida old shit. dead year up.  Let’s open everything flu season hit?   country blowing mind daily. Briefings Tuesdays Thursdays, statistic updates Tuesdays till Fridays.

Notes briefings updated coming minutes:

* earlier press conference day, increase limit public gatherings lifted 50 500 people postponed 15th October.
* 128852 tests perfomrmed week 39, 2.4% positive level higher previous month, 1.6% previous week. 
* 14-day cumulative incidence 49 new confirmed cases per 100 000 people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

Useful links:

* Good visualization information per regions english - ; similar source information intensive care statistics swedish graphs lag information deaths/hospitalization/cases per Another nice website statistical data - districts force kids go school parents options Wow it’s almost Palm beach county completely different country I’m living in. sounds like handled stride there, congratulations. Miami dade county Broward count weren’t fortunate would seem. Yeah, case ourworld data kidding. It’s definitely those. one better nothing. I'm pretty happy Pennsylvania handling it. four populated states four cases order respectively, yet PA, 5th populated 11th cases. also 40th cases per million. Especially considering bad NY NJ right next us. Pandemic fatigue definitely become increasing problem

Its one reason I'm often railing sensational, misleading, and/or fear mongering headlines. going drive pandemic minds people stop caring more. ""Chump don' want help, chump GET da' help!"" Well, actually, virus get vaccine limit spread much possible wide range possible debilitating long term side effects. Going route letting everyone slowly get disease could lead entire generation decade lower life expectancy host medical conditions. yes agree measures proportionate actual risk. unfortunate reality matter though, politicians know actual risk simply educated matter. Hey, confirm new Supreme Court justice save dead babies. Congress doesn’t time spend addressing GLOBAL PANDEMIC.

How every senate republicans running re-election getting destroyed beyond me. People continue vote self interest. living idiocracy. Good, plenty blame go around, think China's missteps forgive anyone else chain handle virus properly, China deserves special attention world stage months spent (knowingly) downplaying virus. I’ve said something similar response “You would surprised.” There’s reasoning people, save breath. also 18k tests compared around 40k they’ve averaging per week... Florida State kids smart? Madrid, someone called Isabel Díaz Ayuso, Isabel Death Ayuso, due awful response virus.

Spain way far handing best way, PP VOX (right wings parties) taking political harm PSOE (centrist) (left) they're ones charge.

Hell, even VOX going propose vote Pedro Sánchez congress way last president, Mariano Rajoy.

Madrid PP's control long remember. Thy've done nothing harm people Madrid.  lmao @ guy complaining restrictions 3 month old bar Aye mental countries, mate got married Jamaica, ever plan going Jamaica, single going see prostitute take condoms you.

They like home made type condoms, wash client used it, give next person. exactly sure material was, fuck washing reusing home made condoms.

This like 2004 maybe they've upped game real condoms wash inbetween clients now. Social distancing important masks, PAris masks mandatory everywhere since one month people wear mask kiss/give hand every fucking time meet. go eat together restaurant hours without masks, so... experience people think way wearing masks anyways... one saying let everyone die. 100% lockdown vs nothing.

This virus stay measures take deal sustainable proportion actual risk. Yep, we’ve able lower cases last month so. find funny see Americans rest world complaining “lock fatigue” reality seems haven’t experienced real lock all. Melbourne, aren’t allowed leave home except get food, medical care, exercise (for maximum 1hr), go work. allowed go work (which majority not), special permit saying allowed working. mask outside it’s $5000 fine something like that. top all, allowed go 5kms house unless work medical reasons, nearest food shop 5kms away. guess what? Melbournians followed lock restrictions managed get cases 5 day 700+ day. hasn’t easiest get sense people know it’s best. Ok like winded? know feeling weird episode June overheated feverish erratic pulse hard catch breath weeks coming stairs laundry whatever would stop landing catch breath I’m typically fit.
I concussion car accident years ago understand mean.

Are symptoms gone still feeling way?
Hope you’re mend!  Great reply /s dont care human rights economy,

I'd argue ""freedumb"" human right (""freedumb"" illegally partying).

The first human right right live, certainly sacrificed economy.

To honest, hate Western countries use ""human right"" term mostly point fingers, certainly live inconvenient us. See, heres thing, Facts dont change dont believe them.

The report says 90%, counter source supports assertion 10%?

A major part we're fuckin mess dickheads want ignore Facts instead spout bullshit better suits narrative. 

It's time deal Fact Point fair, try protect yourself, they're opening knowing full plenty patrons likely get sick die. That's sacrifice economy forces th make helping business stop helping spread virus ""socialism"" People used peacetime, lazy. Previous generations current generations different parts world endure much more. guess circumstances, enemy face, people actually leadership patriotic unity. I'm UK I've got back trip Berlin, public much disciplined here, think saw 4 people wearing masks total 5 days, whereas last time went local shop, one 7 people wearing mask. 

I'll never understand people can't listen basic advice, distance wear mask, buy 50 around £20.....

They even lower distancing standard 1.5m compared 2m yet still much better, speaks absolute volumes. That's arrogance talking ;) ""I went spread disease carrier, *other people* also it!""

It's okay, get it. see bodies people killing, *you* give fuck? like lives worth getting packs smokes, right? exit media entirely, however amount hear certainly drop off. right that.

Whether results less safety precautions remains seen though. guess im..staying doors lot longer hoped Don’t think remember saying that, appreciate reminder isn’t

Likewise, good day realistic anything letting people die seeing happens. I'm willing gamble anything vague utopian ideas virus suddenly magically existing. Well, sound awful confident future someone living Petri dish. Perhaps position comment someone lives 1200 miles you. Good luck, stay safe. real question behind ineptitude legitimate reasons cautious? want scare minorities away voting vooth. immediately benefit capital though happen.

Sorry I'm willing gamble anything vague utopian ideas ""changing system"". data hold children likely tested likely asymptomatic. Children spread like second coming christ, sorry :[ Schools sorta well known petri dishes. article 100% correct imo - germany already Limits gatherings.

The actual discussion limiting private Parties around 50 people declare authorities make party get investigated things... thats think read far. course details dive maybe also wrong points yeah.... opinion problem?

The problem thinking opinion holds weight research dismissing. Everyone entitled opinion. mean opinion worth shit. 

Good day then. mean different state school. Silly want move Canada CU Boulder poorly. New York isn’t city state made choice heavily tied tourism tax revenues via avenues like hotel taxes. makes special vs areas? don’t see much sympathy hard hit areas. 

The mayors wife, elected official, staff 14 cost 2million. comes average salary 140k year. mayors wife staff 14? making teachers? It’s indicative de balsio run city. Budgets massively bloated, it’s making situation 10 times worse. 

As specialized talents, janitors pulling 6 figures. Exactly specialized need clean? Thank much clarification. wonder think virus exit realm media... Oh way stop it, either extra buckle sitting buckled seat belt. removed chime older vehicle. Mentioned recent Skeptics Guide podcast finding patients Covid spring still fatigued. concerning, thoughts anyone whose gone it. ""good"" couple weeks downhill there. FL make results go even higher we'll lull week 2. late October/Early November even higher numbers Winter right around corner there.

All this, coupled election fears stresses turn well. think mid-November US back record fatalities. Ok tell gotten standard vaccines throughout years, trusted personal doctor drove clinic would unreasonable would switching vials every time black person came through, imagine would it.

I surface level understanding uninformed experimenting occurred, awful, think general widespread. wrong? consistently systemic nationwide? case, want exemption liability employers employees catch covid due negligence. money anyone.

What fucking trade. Maybe time swap different type economy fragile. would fine better system place. Change system, sacrifice citizens. Amazon thing political propaganda reality much different. mobile, destop. Yes also 40%. put number low. like set fire, someone decides throw acid well. Thanks geography lesson. assume pointed disagree didn’t anything else add?  economy doom porn? “The lockdowns cause deaths virus?” That’s also fear mongering. time things get better poor middle class poor unite common goals put aside strife. that's media, hands either, spends time stirring strife them. Nah. failed state. We’re waiting 2024 election actual change honest follow politics much, also noticed German government trying get involved countries (but seen attempts help sorts stuff). part people can't imagine Germany without merkel cdu, true all. people (especially young people) discontent way German politics stagnating quite issues current leadership addressing.
Also people know really give shit leadership, money rules politics solved problem, create first place.

As outsider looking in, looks like Brazilian President corrupt give shit environment. wears condom side cover hole wouldn’t want country moral? Bolosnaro failing world amazon policies like imagine everytime account posts covid falls another layer hell desperately trying get somebody understand him. pre peer review study, posted yesterday don’t get either. Restaurant parking lots packed live it’s mind boggling. People pretending it’s over. virus killed ever infected, inbred hillbillies would stayed home. people know they'll survive I'm hoping underlying health conditions. Look like do. done them? Absolutely nothing opinion problem? problem me, problem you? like people opinion?

There quite research documents covid-19 news articles published them, linked here. fairly different findings. Perhaps like person replied to, depends question asked, random participants are, etc. No, I’m going drill one examine statistical basis findings, indeed bias agenda group commissioned study. develop impression (an opinion) time

Now, next weeks started seeing research saying 9 10 coronavirus survivors lingering N.C. symptoms, I’d start change opinion. that’s it’s - aggregating data presented trying read confirmation bias means

But you? empty vessel? Doe new article paper fill awe wonder? doublethink personified? read something today that’s opposite read yesterday, flip opinion match new article? resolutely agnostic entire world? point idea whether coronavirus lasting effects since research grant create run study? mean one one enacted followed enforced? Every then, troops need morale boost. need see sacrifices they’re making pointless, bad things could happen weren’t it. Lots assumptions part. Including 10% people ""barely survive"". children dying

*facepalm*

Are kidding me?

Children die *every* disease. mean need lock forever? Someone put grandpa home please People don’t care anymore it’s going drag years. things legitimately shutdown done right, we’d probably done covid. fellow Floridian works restaurant agree. fellow employees keep saying can’t wait don’t wear mask work 30 days. told I’m still gonna one on.. makes idiot target. BACKWARDS.
Also trump parade cars outside restaurant last weekend. Like 30 cars. I’m doomed. lets forget covid pre-existing condition now. I’m tired us asshole US complete consencus. Stop spreading disinformation. I’m Florida

The smart ones bought fishing equipment started learn new hobby, started playing video games aggressively, started grow weed knowing shortages economical limitations

But believe hoax, faaaaaaar many people here, anywhere child 80 year old man think it’s hoax virus control people, I’ve told since governor lifted mask fines “why wearing thing? know don’t anymore?”

Either way, stupid congregate bars, I’m going fishing *You* virtually want. beg *everybody* it.

For once, agree CDC. COVID19 mutated already. mutated multiple times. 

This reason ""mild"" cases ""severely deadly"" cases. DNA also plays role. also explains people weird side effects, stay sick 3-5 months.

Its partly scientists adament telling us lockdown 100%, reducing spread, diminishes completely. 

It allows time figure fight 1 virus instead 10 different variants. due Trump morons around country, s___ creek paddle. Biden get elected enact top Federal plan quickly mitigates virus? must exhausting Fauci, watching train pick speed leaves station towards washed bridge. Honestly, know. Spain reopen nightclubs June Italy still hasn't? Man deluded. incapable admitting wrong, even worse, want every case reinfection documented feel even thought fighting it. really sound like Trumps ""if test less, there'll less cases"" argument. got two different strains Virus infected twice. like guy HK. Yes, second case milder, cases covid mild. argument completely invalid, since reinfection perfectly possible caused mutation. really lol That's friend said. Yes pretty bright things know effective treatment became available treat tell treatment, right? That’s great article, thank you. Covid might pretty rough winter since know indoors much higher risk may also factors play well, absolute humidity.

Argentina, Chile, South Africa got hit fairly hard winter none anywhere near volume initial cases US currently has. although Australia managed contain strictly enforced lockdown, outbreak related quarantine hotels Victoria blew rapidly.

I worry “herd immunity” places like NYC turn instead sufficient level immunity population prevent transmission summer environment many people wearing masks high-risk businesses like indoor dining closed. 100%. DeSantis' last ditch effort saving economy he's realized Cavalry (in form second stimulus) likely coming. think calculus save snowbird season attract cooped mid-high income earners otherwise would taken winter vacations Carib Europe, might able save budget. increases likelihood making us one states few/no restrictions. 

There's also looming unemployment crisis. Florida's U3 looks better many employees ""furloughed"" laid off- like 2,000 Seaword/BG, another 5,000 Universal, Disney release figures, 1000s, Hard rock somewhere near 1000... that's major tourist spots. DeSantis get theme parks, hotels, beaches busy again, might generate enough revenue balance budget...

And that's kicker. balanced budget amendment here. cannot deficit spend. DeSantis way pay teacher pay increase program right now.

He's unenviable position. matter does, Floridians going lose. harming lot rest world aswell.

No, not, stupid media this. predicted back April/May deluge clickbait articles suggesting Sweden nothing stop virus world (especially British, reason) media - lie people Sweden nothing Sweden puts epidemic control, end lot people think nothing fine. Swedish authorities repeatedly attempted debunk crap, avail, them. again, wrong.

USA done better job treating infected. Man dont even read say. shenanigans Florida keep reminding Washington Nationals relief pitcher Sean Dolittle said baseball reopened.

[Sports like reward functioning trying bring baseball back pandemic that’s killed 130,000 people. We’re way worse country March shut thing down. And, like, look developed countries response this. haven’t done things countries done bring sports back. Sports like reward functioning society. we’re trying bring back, even though we’ve taken none steps flatten curve.  flatten curve little bit, didn’t use time anything productive. opened back Memorial Day. decided we’re done it.”

What said baseball reopening basically what's happening Florida lot places US. DeSantis, Floridians, many others decided they're done whole pandemic thing. next nothing slow spread, they're going full steam ahead reopenings anyway.

We're rewarding failure. Imagine getting covid went drag show fuck people know answer question?  


They pretending GOP believes help election November. intentionally letting Americans die strategy believe help get votes. Let's pretend things rosy pandemic. hurtling toward serious deleveraging period anyway. pandemic showed catalyst. it, would found another catalyst. provides convenient cover politicians say ""how could known"" reality, majority economic damage pandemic going happen anyway...and includes next waves come. pandemic mostly responsible massive damage small businesses lock downs without support inflicted. Small businesses major fuel middle class. disproportionately damage done middle class lock downs, much happened happen (yes, worst yet come) already way. US could solved easily providing temporary UBI one would worry choosing bankruptcy sickness. Whose businesses damaged inevitably go back lockdown again. might knows reason suspect carrying infectious disease obliged take necessary measures protect others risk knows carrying disease classified dangerous public obliged provide information infection people comes contact significant risk infection transmission may arise.

COVID-19 classified dangerous society level dangerous public. 

But right law used like that. used people purposely misbehaving obeying direct instructions doctors isolate instance. Working supersedes health safety. 

Uhh.. what? Working *is* health safety America. create Reddit account can't put together? Get tickets security theater! sample 1000 doesn’t lie, again, interpretation extrapolation entire population flawed. sample could biased. Correlation equal causation statement used emphasize fact something lines doesn’t make true. 

It’s funny you’re arguing statistics you’re also arguing correlation. side even here? even make dig graves Indonesia.  😆 love got downvoted stating facts Well boys it. pandemic more. true sense government probably stop caring election. People get sick die without level urgency preventing it. ""It is."" armchair experts telling COVID big deal! People fucking dumb surprise Oh god, even thought that. Stupid sounds, governor actually pretty smart. must thinking sort strategy sabotage election. people virtual thanksgiving, spike cases ensure Virtual Christmas New Year. Cognitive dissonance one hell drug wasn’t initial post. already derailed idiot. live hk btw. pretty good idea need make work makes think cases deaths going keep declining start eliminating restrictions opposed opposite result? people think data untrustworthy based 9 months worth corrections, misprints, misquotes, sensationalized, otherwise false information spread. bunch ammunition ready trust X piece info. Plus, side hypocrite one point another. way actually ""side"" all. us reading knowledge issue.

Example) 

* Yeah, listen scientists. exactly say .

*CDC changes guidelines new information scientific discoveries*

* Trump *infiltrated* CDC. They're compromised! Sorry man, sucks cant accurare.

Its not. fear mongering best. sub eat up. 'Murica, people would complain restrictions something ""muh freedom"" ""muh rights""... rise Netherlands. finally instituting mask mandate indoors, saying wasn’t enough evidence efficacy. earth didn’t sooner? Good luck social distancing public transportation, next bus 45 minutes away.  shouldn’t downplay pandemic fatigue (i.e. comparing impatient toddler) - it’s real phenomenon needs addressed serious manner like recession 2008, people taking jobs survive. 
As rich get richer. US vast territory 1 climate. 

Winter northeast midwest might way described, southeast southwest completely different. Florida, everyone outside ""winter"" temps pleasant, they're inside ""summer"" breathing recirculated air hot hell outside. 

And think anyone California, Arizona, Texas, Nevada, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, etc... experiencing 4 months freezing weather. 

Why everyone always think entire US northeast? dem office it’s gonna make neck break watching swivel “it’s hoax” “Democrats literally murdering thousands you” owner MyPillow company horrible human sells pillow bought anywhere dozens manufacturers much cheaper 'patented' product.  Yes. initial post else think explains rising infection rate people careful wearing masks social distancing?

I pointing it’s way complicated that. Social distancing broad term, agree one would get infected everyone kept themselves, that’s case neither Italy Spain, though. 

It also general post, directed you. I’ve seen plenty people say things like ”almost one town wearing mask, we’re fucked” ”I saw people sitting pretty close restaurant today, we’re fucked”. don’t understand.

Why Zerg conspiring Evil destroy Earth? Zerg lives there. never actually committed 15 days national level. states cities took seriously, others half-assed it. - George Carlin Sweden harming lot rest world aswell.

Piss off. arent anything anyone else. anything misinformation Sweden harmful countries. happily perpetuating misinformation. Trump symptom, cause. ballot vaccine!!!!!!!!!! /s It’s deeply disturbing older people ones actually vote, based tons misinformation read Facebook. Young people seem know exactly what’s going on, none us vote. Sad. used study WI. Loved place. Thankful I'm longer living also concerned friends there. here. course higher positivtiy rate shows situation worrying, getting control yet. Well, true election virus disappear Trump care economy tanks gets elected again, could go hard virus shut country long needed.

And Biden comes in, would better management. Either way, virus disappear. [He's sharpest marble bag. paid directly person, tax free You’re right, head empty coffee!! think take account return-time covid-test-results. someone something shorten streamline routines return - time shortened andvkess time takes rt-PCR-test good opinion andcmany me. one thing Rt-PCR-test performed far labs PCR-lab-machines *expensive*.

Dogs olfactory senses much better humans versatile. Eventually develop electronic noses detect need find takes minutes. know joke coworkers told voting people graduated electoral college get votes counted sure. This. daughter kindergarten would function online learning. Also, vigilant screen time feel like plopping front iPad wasn’t good idea. far school gone smoothly, youngest really options. People act like it’s horrible parenting decision send person, able teach neither husband. Parent shaming weirdest flex entire pandemic... No. one stays home cold. One hospital keeping track whole state? Maybe one hospital 2 percent. many people actually go hospital tested? many. It’s testing sites. 66 percent family live Iowa alone virus. brother Iowa City, wife, son, sister northern Iowa, daughter, son. That’s anecdotal, sure, common know many Iowa ... everyone does. 2 percent ass. Maybe 2 percent hospitalized area positive. numbers wrong state, inflating. going State-side Sweden experiment. think work terribly well, open surprised. Mind boggling service workers put risk profit business owners. Servers wearing masks protect diners way around. Nixon ???? big business got ballsy played cards skies blue. location employer closes again, top earner location country, open again. $7 million dollar loan payments monthly they're violating state guidelines, feeding us employees masses rude, entitled, ""chinese virus"" mocking people (one customer's words, really wish joking). close, we'll see 500 jobs gone like that, jobs currently coming grabs daily positive customers given free reign area positive employees forced come work threatened without pay. 



Rideshare dangerous normal times year,my friend. hope stay safe trying times. one I've seen pop waves, recently last week, % survival rate based age. think posting survival rate 99% people age 11 somehow proves fake - ignoring obvious ramifications continued spread others, fact even survival rate worse localized breast cancer. Yet focus disinfection one paying attention aerosol transmission it’s easier wipe things social distance wear masks around friends family. I'm first push Europe industrialized world taking responsibility and, example, stop using fossil fuel generate electricity stop using fossil fuel power individual mobility.

But justify destruction rainforest. can't compare coverage forest Europe rainforest. Even forest, help global storage CO2 oxygen generation way rainforest does.

I'd sorry took bullying Brazil agree help prevent great dangers climate change pose, I'd sorry took bullying Germany country start taking action, does, preferable letting people ruin whole planet everyone ready take action necessary. outrage. many got ill poorly ventilated areas forced go back without ppe maintain supply lines food Americans. won’t pay family death Benifits I’m sure made profit food prices went up. Idiots lol claim knew conditions would reappear. claimed feel fully recovered. would still go doctor checkups like currently checkups. getting test long lasting effects unless feel paranoia wallets gonna feel that. Can't say much without getting flagged politics. we're done Covid, mean Covid done us. add people scientific expertise CDCs mobility mortaility reporting [review administration also politicized reporting FDA treatment effectiveness, causing major [miscommunication MSM reporting this. reality causing people doubt safety effectiveness comes institutions. bad news middle pandemic. heard stable genius say vanished magically end april. true. However, given we're also pandemic, person will... hopefully (maybe I'm optimistic here)... take little precautions. 

Also, many businesses flat tell leave sick otherwise before.

If choose likely get Covid from, someone cold covid seems less likely someone Covid symptoms.

Gets every time. coronavirus won’t able kill “large part” population .6% IFR Third world country exactly that.

btw, asymptomatic people transmit 75% efficiency. Nearly half transmission asymptomatic people. Why? flu literally deadly kids Coronavirus. UK government response pandemic (and still is) shambolic - 4 different responses exact (England, Scotland, Wales NI), adds confusion. Again, agree, choice. also juggle that, worked years call centar, night shifts cooking time. remained slim. managed excersise wake like zombie 3 pm work 10 pm. SC we’ve told we’re allowed anything offer mask customer hasn’t got one. Somehow employees also allowed wear mask wear face shield 🤣 I’m going finger-point one country many done neat trick everyone’s incredibly sensitive nationalistic bullshit. people died home (and half do) getting shipped crematoriums deliberately without tested keep books. particular example, concentration, covid yet concentration sucks ass lately. idea adjust factors include impacts global pandemic. 

Maybe differences folks reported long term symptoms well run country vs (political) shithole something. We're end beginning. start beginning end. husband got covid. isolated isolated *just case*. Realistically, probably late time found out, case.

So recovers, issues smell, good overall. zero symptoms. Cool, get away scott free.

Couple weeks later start breathing issues. two months later, still can't anything gets heart rate up, I'm inhaler, I'm scheduled see pulmonologist. 

It's fucking crazy. I've felt fantastic otherwise. Literally, symptoms. Wtf covid... think follow-up provided statistics you’re looking for. -2 edited comment, appears people value facts made way post. good day! they're mostly bullshit. Politicizing it? socially liberal conservative. individual party (well kind party guess Senators abandoned morality). look back history see pro-life activist 2A supporter. agree peer review though. black doctors included. sure can.

In fact, states fine people wearing mask. 

And yet mask rules enforced everyday. Perhaps Trump signed executive order police arrest people.

Ask control group never Covid exact questions see difference two. 

Since March experienced noticeable increase fatigue, difficulty sleeping, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, concentration, hair loss, muscle pains. gotten sick, I’ve mostly staying home. Without control group never Covid, can’t sure Covid caused symptoms, particularly less severe cases.

Maybe people hate persecution complex. 7 years old didnt really choice. Plus wth know? zero prospects hometown. know hate? People assuming. far lower expected. India default healthcare seems assume 10x deaths 100x cases. @ 15x cases excess deaths would around 1.5

Correlating covid projections data India, would excess deaths around 1.6
For India 1.6 deaths excess deaths normal deaths would huge improvement existing testing tracing capabilities really paranoia [happened Nah.

Nothing police handling anything makes word love come mouth currently. 

Defund police stupid blanket term. 

But obvious U.S. police departments need sweeping reform...and starts ground up!!! full bad seeds 2020 clearly exposed it. 

They need money training less supposed nonlethal weapons use brain damaging life changing weapons! 

40 hours training mental health care freaking joke someone called defend scenes deadly weapons expected act rationality dealing people mental health issues. 

It's basic recipe disaster!!! Well done, Funk! Someone possesses fabled common sense....

Had government said start ""save n95s hospitals care homes (you buy anyway) sew, fold, tie home made face coverings, may help"" instead "" stupid use right follow two pieces advice time (wear mask socially distance)"" might well better now, UK, least.

e: grammar R0 number wrong. It’s 4...not 2.5. already told can't predict future infections. can't that, predict future age demographics? operating assumption vaccine developed effective, probably will, still can't guarantee it. it’s getting directly shunned 

While happening everywhere, US particular things get shunned for. Murder/rape, anything around political spectrum (eg: say minority groups, religion, think children, etc) that's it. Smoking outlier here, honest (and people smoke inside subway stations, outside leaning no-smoking signs time. inside private buildings people actually say something, usually trigger alarm something). 


Aside that, nothing gets shunned. People used fact people around piss off, grumble walk away that's it.  


Masks falling bucket. fact pushed much (as little?) already politicized. Otherwise would barely get talked all. kills people used properly would barely blip radar. W.. T.. F 😱

Poor Peru, they’re lovely people. Glad see NC ""low staying low"" list Public shaming really thing works. people keep shirts hot, spit buildings, people wear masks Asia. people look maskless people mutter ""ew, gross"" loudly tell kids get close, frown. That's works end. 

Works way too. Lots people probably would wear masks think peers judge it. suspect that's folks wear ""macho"" trades like police, etc. Could coincidental, maybe actually got flu?

I'm pretty sure takes 10 14 days body build immunity shot. So, would still vulnerable time. There's already phenomenon 'con flu' due notoriously bad hygiene things. rename Corona Con. Well, 70+ nursing homes, they're still recommended isolate 1:st. Definitely needed expert point out! pandemic mostly wound then. doubt there'll much uptake point. 

What's funny children really need vaccine COVID scarcely affects them, whereas elderly need vaccine, likely benefit immunosenescence. 

You might make argument vaccine induced herd immunity protecting elderly, we're going reach herd immunity threshold naturally long next fall. all! think would get banned? genuinely interested hearing facts. Yesterday Abbott test touted president states already ordered it. would ban now? 1674 resets elect Trump every time. do!!

Another benefit forgot mention think important saving thousands micropipettings poor scientists Yep, enforce proper mask wearing store. can't leave, like someone wearing pants dick hanging out...it count.

Florida seen first pediatric death directly covid, gonna get wave kawasaki 4-6 weeks since really need get lot kids find kid dies Ah, finally speaker humanity! Good know.
Sorry misspell, main language.

Still, 'my opinion' many, many official reports far. conspiracy, nonsense. thought common knowledge now. Yet find curious mentions herd immunity every week so.

These Covid fact 'battles' worst horror all. Dan Carlin amazing thanks heads up. definetly listen that.  Anyone reading going think ur tripping dude lol nobody saying facts Fuck them. Attempted murder charges, now! Ah got - thanks data doesn’t support conclusion yet - respiratory infections often side effects, even healthy people. I'm sure I've read headline before, China... Yes, in-person learning might allow students learn better, socialize often, *safer*? areas spread coronavirus contained... is, almost *nowhere* America.

Any benefits returning in-person classes *immediately* outweighed risk increased virus transmission. Yes, online school cause students suffer academically emotionally, little cause concern, *every student boat??* 

If school district would like try opening school buildings anyway, *got* strict social distancing, cleaning, mask wearing protocols place. ideally, schools America online *all* students *and* teachers taken vaccine... which, article believed, occur another year, even longer. Florida goes back business usual nothing happens, actually good news I'll start soften opinion easing restrictions.

 course, know case. That’s vaccine expected widespread According 7 day moving average 761 deaths. Huge swings daily #s normal mean much. It’s actually closer 1.4 million account excess deaths.. add deaths collateral damage. usually happens never flu shot adverse effects past.

The first time husband got flu shot, pharmacist asked hang 10 minutes.

Never asked us always say get every year. None people involved feel way possible vaccines produce stronger and/or longer-lasting antibody response. 

preliminary reports stage III trials showing that, actually. belief faster return normalcy, avoids getting disease. instance

Peru countries. fluoroantimonic acid

the police went tanks full stuff sprayed everyone everything it. millionaires get tested every day outbreak.... That's awesome them. They've already got lot deal with; good COVID might severe anymore. notice people living slums generally stronger immune systems most, sure something new like COVID would fit in. like people going easy time getting vaccine comes out. American exceptionalism? Lmao! talking black Americans well black people parts world looks like America exceptionalism huh? alone can't take seriously. time you. it’s fox news can’t stop watching administration directly interfered communications coming FDA 

Source? think confusing CDC he's said may bypass current vaccine regulations. 

He allowed later stages testing occur previous ones come back positive. earlier stages still required come back positive vaccine used, allowing multiple testing stages happen simultaneously speed along development much rapidly, lead TON monetary expense. I'm sure politicization.

I’m sure politicization. first one haven’t found much, evidence of. second one isn’t political slightest, rule change won’t affect safety of, accelerate development MUCH needed vaccine. 

If SOMEHOW political (it isn’t), side trump issue, he’s actually side science time. Maybe national guard attack college campus? it, lingered tiredness. I'd leave house earlier get work walking train getting train walking work 6 blocks HELL. £ symbol Pound Sterling, article probably referring UK. can’t imagine dumb enough believe this. I’ll definitely look up! sister-in-law making masks time now. Might time learn though. enjoyed textiles .. oh.. 20 years ago. Hehe. Thank you! tell people ventilators hospital. amplified #9....stupid people think immune. long immunity last common cold-type coronaviruses?

I thought saw pretty short those. Well, lots us much less likely exposed last 6 months working home wearing masks going taking subway office. Plenty idiots graduated Harvard. average? Sure. low bar. That's silly. Communists give money away. True. Makes even worse. Every time get sick long term side effects. shortens life span, makes susceptible illnesses. well known studied many years. absolutely never get back point health contracting disease. cellular biology works. like cannot “boost” immune system normal functioning level is.

What need focus side effect severe be. Denying exist foolish dangerous. Also person appears healthy recovering doesn’t mean course years come won’t discover correlated side effects. Without claiming people them: protests important wedding. wire strips borderline useless, pulse still fog up. You’re incredibly fortunate afford that. Many like would love simply cannot. Damn. Mask mandate statewide, enforce social distancing, fine businesses, ticket individuals, clamp violations get shit control, Canada actually lets Canadian snowbirds come whole winter.

But needed get started couple four months ago, didn’t. state fucked.

Wonder much cheaper place Villages going year now. That's ideally following CDC's guidelines good enough anyone. shocking disheartening see fail keep step science due political pressure. friend who's 34 got 3 months ago still tremors regained sense smell. weird, unpredictable disease im still day three waiting test... mask fogging glasses means tight enough around nose. Teach properly fit mask buy good respirator. Morocco tagged ""Europe"" ?? retarded, French and/or huge noses. It’s almost there’s good chance there’s going completely different government time mass distribution starts. think coronavirus hoax bad flu. fact never tell going effect and/or loved ones. responsible, stop spread. wear mask like I'll automatically assume also wear underwear dick hanging mean, colleges? 1. human lives.

2. selfish ones spread people distancing etc, making everything country tried ineffective. 

3. sick people means opportunities Covid mutate, meaning need develop test vaccines. Eventually able fast enough. I'm saying calling people toddler spoiled teenagers helping - insults people need change behavior would make feel victimized (note folks talking probably already 'victim' complex). effective ways get positive change !  friend's mother infected February every weeks Oxygen levels plummet 80s. permanent lung damage tied back Covid-19. yes new virus long term damage means 6 months later time goes studies done. don’t, weirdo. glad lowering deaths one old guy walks around mask nose mouth. Figure one out. little look political sponsorship US would likely prove true, yes. pEOPLE REMEMBER OVERALL HEALTCARE SYSTEM MUST TAKEN ACCOUNT.

“Over past six months, we’ve struggling important question: “Should even ATTEMPT L.A. Comic Con 2020?” Chris DeMoulin, general manager con, told Los Angeles Daily News.

“Since March, we’ve living version ‘Lockdown/Safer Home’ world, trying hard stay safe, hoping praying health safety ourselves, family, friends, neighbors fellow human beings. We’re wearing masks, keeping socially distant, remaining thankful frontline workers, hospital personnel everyone working hard make difference.

“And yet, yearn little bit normality, reclaim aspects lives pre-COVID.” one tried warn virus later died. seems short memory. Anecdotes belong garbage virus emanating them?

The virus emanating nature. go nature revenge. doctor arrested?
Don't speculate, please. People ducking idiots flu vaccine. flu horrible sickness. Obviously Covid way worse doesn’t almost everyone get damn flu shot? It’s easy prevents super shitty week count among became symptomatic, Covid-19 deadlier flu. led notion lockdowns necessary Covid-19 like seasonal flu.

Your site garbage share it.

This post wrong. Ehhhh, I’m sure it’s good idea. don’t think cosplay masks prevent covid infections. Nah.. people get it.. He's going herd immunity hard-core mode. Weak people die... strong survive.

In Singapore, every building enter, every shop building, every business enter, QR code entry QR code exit. infected, government pull data immediately know contact days, where. contact people places quarantine.

That's close infection clusters.

At 1 point, Singapore 1500 infections per day. 1 2 local infections per day. testing, extensive contact tracing. use clickbait webpage made generate trafic google ads source.

Yes, method dealing harsh, method system. best part lockdown blessed absence traffic (I live NJ). Nobody tailing went store, giving finger getting way. Dog walks bike rides peaceful &amp; good. independent belong conference? ? 200k Americans dead. Fuck  daughter started back school May, Shenzhen. Everybody fill health declaration get tested. first started everybody wear masks distancing within classrooms.

Since returning summer break things lot relaxed, still thier temp checked mornings use hand sanitizer school masks anymore distancing classrooms, often work groups. Things pretty much back normal. mention growing mental health issues, homelessness, mass unemployment. Outliers like exist viral infection. Yes, includes flu. That's back march.

Started really weak cold, germany lockdown probably would've gone work first week. 

I felt better 5-6 days first symptoms, feeling almost completely fine another 2-3 days hit hard really severe flu symptoms (lots coughing, mild fever, heavy brain fog, muscle pain). 

Slight symptoms persisted 1 month, mainly stuffed nose.  

My immune system also definitely took hit, live upstairs doctor I'm exposed tons flu/cold viruses every day definitely get easier sick longer. lot people power America idiots seems months we’ve told Florida crash burn. I’m sorry able tell difference bad situation untenable one. wish Floridans careful, understand people see doomsday predictions crying wolf now. I've seen many arguments right Reddit closing kill people ways, like starvation homelessness.

And like...you think anything letting bunch people die effect economy? pretend nothing bad happening, economy keep chugging like normal, even though bunch people staying home responsible? fucks sake. shit literally driven thousands kill themselves, people built spend year isolation. doctors determine heart damage? like made test it? Yes said none ones stuck hit hard. bad didn’t stick Ahahahahahahhahahahaja Social distancing enforced think taking people task enforcing masks early pandemic fair realistic. done. simply enough masks; even government stockpiles went poof overnight.

Hospitals everywhere absorbed like black hole, even paid exhorbitant prices, still get them. Hand sanitisers also dissappeared shelves e-commerce platforms. ended paying $70 tiny bottle toddler use. dire.

There reason downplayed mask usage; enough. Healthcare workers doctors perpetually short way past 6 month mark pandemic. responsible governments later overturned supplies became reliable; countries simply refused budge change course. nothing says God's blessed union fuck y'all. 10x dangerous seasonal flu bad? Really. 

If consider flu seasonal Covid not. every year covid would become less 10x dangerous, would not? makes sense all. went places reopened came down. thought going hit 100,000 cases per day like everyone predicted. numbers dropped themselves. Florida fuckall numbers still dropped. Respiratory pathogens spread efficiently colder weather, people huddled indoors warmth. Also, large national election coming up, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's. events, holidays include travel, large gatherings, leading increased transmission. declining usage masks, social distancing, I'm worried may mean may substantial influenza season compared southern hemisphere had. fear leading perfect storm fall winter. hope I'm wrong. horrible thought—people traveling back surrounding states infect people :/ Stay November 3rd please. seem reasonable need FL F Dr Fauci I'm asked. real HOAX damn economy. sad see USA sink swim mode. reality many day broke whats point. USA broke af ! didn’t say don’t mutate. actually said second wave caused mutation falsely attributed flu season. 

But thanks proving point guess? Czech Republic, low numbers early mask requirement dropped hit far worse March.

I really wonder is! /s That's really going put dent TV ratings. Florida going rough place three weeks. proviso ""if it"" indicates (as state response) truly believe put excess mass without consuming calories be.

A person beri-beri, kidney disorder become disturbingly large due fluid retention. sure many medical circumstances similar true, know, doctor.

And unless know specifics unwilling pass judgement, rather I'll give benefit doubt.

And that's I'm pleased dislike image mirror I've held up.

What thoughts following article lol vaccine China probably fudging numbers Wuhan style lockdown definitely going effective. pretty obvious no-one's allowed physical contact anyone number infections going go down.  I'm almost certain none talking points allowed mods here.

If subtle way argue people raise legitimate concerns virus need banned live bubble optimism, think asking something legitimate. really appreciate he's this. might seem like much lot people, authority figure saying, need get shots well. R0 would much lower lethal Ebola. Dead people poor spreaders. Sure. don’t believe plays anywhere near role circlejerk claims. love ""small"" government helps citizens times crisis? Many? many many?

According shy 25M people recovered. 10% probably?  probably long past 250K.

i dont trust numbers anymore Same. real wake read /r/COVID19Positive blame speed reading courses college. mild dry throat kind thing gets worse around day 10 (after first symptom) so. However, would feel really sick bad time go hospital.

Some people never all, like headache loss smell.

And, know, people maybe dropped dead stroke randomly. that's rare one knows why.

The one thing heavy exercise recommended COVID, chill month safe. know else say. That's medical advice, way, worried random effect, that's one thing want feel better.

Ultimately, almost certainly going okay. But, feel really sick go hospital talk doctor. Yeah sure, distancing works, 6 feet distancing properly keeping yourself.

Still, saying Victoria used masks + usual prevention measures misrepresenting reality. OMG... would thought? What’s funny ironically putting nose mouth probably better mostly breath nose. nurse let say shit Sherlock  OMG... would thought?

These vaccines frozen—in Pfizer/BioNTech’s case, ultracold **–94 degrees Fahrenheit,** colder freezers—which limit shipped. It’s mostly old dudes too- least I’ve seen. I’m guy :)

But, address point, you’ve also touched door handles minimum public/work bathroom, people wiped asses washed hands also touched. I’m going stick with, wash hands always. Throw dry ice done it. sounds like problem solved money, end result rebooting economy, know first world countries pay top dollar distribute it. Ikr. work certain popular coffee chain rhymes ""bar-cucks."" corporate policy customers required wear masks store, manager gets onto us try enforce policy. 🤷🏻‍♀️ I'm away people outside, dont fogs glasses tell trouble breathing mask quarantining avoid getting sick, definitely end hospital get covid. article say Turkey striving this? sounds like prognosis... Liquid nitrogen. *mic drop* Fatigue brain fog/inability focus possible symptoms, it, asymptotic. Could COVID, could body reacting seasonal changes, could something else. wanted point there's lot ""asymptotic except [symptom]"" going around actually means person symptomatic generally mild case.

At rate, good luck! Hope feel better soon test negative. They're mad moderates, too. Damn you, Bill Clinton! Sars cov 2 eliminates MHC infected cells. might add delay viral clearance. Unfortunately many antimaskers bunch Clevon Idiocracy already spawned lotof kids. unless ur sarcastic, covering nose defeats entire purpose you’re risk getting people sick Oh boi see people time pick nose touch public surfaces. Less since covid 19, I’ve still seen it. 

At playground, caregiver, I’m exaggerating, jammed entire hand back jean shorts, adjusted whatever needed adjusting continued pushing baby swing. 

Truth stranger fiction. Wash hands. Humans gross species. American here, one doctors makes wait lobby temperature checks fill questionnaire, get actual office (with chairs social distancing) bloody front desk staff wearing damn masks correctly! get it! Sweden 14th (or 12th dont count small countries) world self reported covid deaths. everyone knows better look excess deaths since everyone counts reports way. compare excess deaths Sweden much better (they basically report much many others report little). includes countries like Portugal Netherlands deaths per capita whe comparing coronavirus deaths.

Its true Sweden used right wing strategy, approach similar US, Brazil UK, extremely left.

They also used leftist methods fight virus. could locked people homes would much much cheaper, atleast short run. 

For example april highest number people ever (twice high 2019) staying home getting paid take care sick children. children sicker, guidelines says stay home slightest symtoms. Similarly government made get paid stay home youre sick before. Riskgroups gets paid stay home etc.

Did Brazil US this? constantly feel like say, ""fuck it"" live life normally (but wearing mask) can't bring to. Why? one around gotten they've lived lives normally, masks. anxiety sense following science can't let me. &amp;#x200B;

you need **laboratory** equipment - commercial sushi freezers go -30F - can't use ""meat vaccines frozen—in Pfizer/BioNTech’s case, ***ultracold –94 degrees Fahrenheit, colder freezers—which limit shipped.***

&amp;#x200B;

**A race make enough small glass vials deliver coronavirus vaccine around vaccine: 8,000 jumbo jets needed deliver doses globally, says coronavirus vaccine arrives, world make Sweden herd immunity approach, Sweden relevant here? Still trying get back parent told one time. 2020 fucking shitshow.

Taking GF dinner? Illegal.

Now next level shit - getting married? Illegal.

Just wondering else gonna illegal shitshow ends. Oh yeah definitely. Wasn’t literally either audio video recording senator warning group donors worse anything they’ve seen, bad Spanish Flu, back government general still publicly telling us threat didn’t alter daily lives? Like that’s even conspiracy theory literally news... makeshift masks pointless too.. like wierd burlap cloths bandanas, filter nothing literal boogers. Aerosolized particles go right material... lol critical thinking. sure. actually wear like cause it’s easier breathe still abiding rules. one calls nose hangs. Pretty fucking simple. people dicks. starbucks made eye contact guy standing little close me, like close even pre-covid days. knew bothering decided pull mask nose. bet would’ve pulled wouldn’t kicked staff. cAn'T bReAtHe 🙄  I'm discussing article Nature, best journal world. generally use media articles get information sort stuff. academic studies. know, went full mask whole thing started, covid would probably way respiratory virus invades cells via ACE2 receptor. ACE2 found organs body. gyms signs ""enforcing mask policy"" kicks members complain people wearing masks. like sometimes People look dumb nose anyway. It’s become sign they’re probably unreasonable. work retailer ask members pull masks, course, whining bitching something that’s literally nothing (in lot cases). Freedom speech action, freedom consequences. 

Of course, everyone unwilling, still. times meaning well isn’t enough. page. got proper nose piece insert mask, would pull mask high enough nose pads glasses sitting mask caused pinch air pockets kept fogging up. There's different ways combat it, people lazy changed post better reflect trying say. merely stating large indoor gathering, really going help. hold dramatic effect...

DUH Muh freedoms muh conspiracies. 


You’re right. I’m sheep. wish could know truth like you.

/s since people might’ve missed sarcasm. testing NFL players government funded. It’s privately outsourced contract paid NFL. Republicans That's sad. worries, consider part solution rather part problem ! wear homemade textile masks fogging problem cold mornings. states go home. Sturgis 2.0 - costumes! family probably already getting death threats people think crisis actors. know put thought dump drowning emotional stress need get out. feel like randomly woke March snapped rhyme reason. feel like came reason panic I'm suffering delusions. Everywhere around me, people laughing face homeschooling kids. I'm putting much work teach home. seen parents year March supposed next visit. left house much, besides drives walks around place live grocery shopping. Six months feel like us. Everyone else shopping, vacationing, swimming, lessons full time person learning cases school. led completely normal life I've sitting house like I'm batshit crazy. Trying hardest teach children I'm professional educator. ""friends"" feel need share memes Dumb Dumber saying kids like Lloyd me. sort self-created hell? myself? Hey I'm trying find reliable news sources days mind. Thank insight! thanks! think opinion special needed? don’t comment every thought races across brain. lost crapload hair severe non-anemic iron deficiency. get ferritin tested, sometimes way lower hemoglobin definitely cause issues. actually think people think it'll disappear would angry. they'd think hoax point shutting ever make you? virtue signaling Karen? feel morally superior? make feel better wear mask properly? Good job Karen! 

Change view i’m gonna preface saying i’m kind germaphobe, alwayssss wash hands bathroom, really you’re guy don’t touch toilet piss, really matter much wash hands saw opposite day. woman surgical masked rolled covering nose. talking loudly speaker phone. clearly looking argument. people stupid rude wear mask (correctly) new theory people (wear mask incorrectly) fall two categories: 
One: people lack basic knowledge mask works basic human biology, germs spread epidemiology. 

Two: statement, wear mask one force correctly. “I’m charge life.”

I see people time nose showing think, ones may know, please wear correctly ones carrying much anger resentment, let go, find another cause fight against. endangering others. Goodbye mate. 

I explained position multiple times clearly refused even read said decided construct strawman attack. Next time even bother commenting basic comprehension abilities. think blow back economic meltdown would happen unsafe vaccination get improperly disseminated. symptoms affect ability work productively all. Another reason maintain economic damage failing contain virus. Yet people maintain lockdown effects virus 🙄  try skirt rules want think it’s common guest  yeah seems pretty obvious. Blocking aerosols come mouth talking coughing seems like still SOMETHING. Hello, American friend! mask nothing help mouth, mean wear mask nose? nose plugs? exactly thought. wearing right, wearing all.  I'm trying show small percentages add upp, lazy look real numbers calculate real. spent like minute it.

If got 0.1% also lot pf people, happy. need report confirm this. Hell ya obviously it’s equivalent wearing mask. else people need clarification to? I've heard ""no fog"" spray co-workers use glasses swear it. huge tragedy someone dies *of preventable disease* old age. You’re acting like people mad old people die. They’re mad old people dying due incompetence. Floridian skeptical whole “the numbers go heat” thing Floridian willingly spends time outdoors summer absolutely to. is. pulled mask times like store bus... comfortable. irritating. make sure mask good seal. wear glasses too, since got good reusable/washable mask like $20, issues glasses fogging up.

I rather physical labor work (enough work good sweat, too). long wear mask right fine. Learn something new everyday. idea link follicles blood flow way describe. Thank you! makes lot sense. United States history unethical treatment black people medical studies. Tuskegee syphillis studies pretty bad. Nice try, gonna work though. done PRC. Lies, pain suffering products. 

China pay. Exactly. Without states would run unemployment money.....which people would money.....no food, water, home.

That's *real rioting* would take place. Like Mad Max wasteland shit. bought Dremel instructions points used dental work. answer question resounding ""yes."" kids die flu season, yet schools open flu season protocols masks place. it'd make sense either start showing concern society neither. least let's consistent. people wear face shields mask all, that's worst. also see employees this. Mate simple?

Yeah, done here. can't actually argue point, call names. Goodbye. mean, one would angry actually did. imagine it’s partially appear like you’re following rules/doing part, partially morons think “well it’s hard breathe, breathe less force nose, afford expose that.” Yeah, would take freedom away idiot psychopaths don’t posses part brain produces empathy. shit. I’m sure could find something recent, presently don’t time go searching. point well established field cellular biology. give brief summary why. 

Telomeres regulate number times cell replicate. amount cell replicate referred hay-flick limit. Anything increases amount cellular replication (wether across whole organism localized) shortens life. simple cut finger won’t shorten life (barring secondary infection), trauma directly vital organ almost certainly measurable effect longevity.

Now obviously can’t measure results prior effects. could shorten life millisecond several decades. measured statistical probability. It’s say smoking increasing risk cancer. 

To summarize: stress shortens lifespan way sparking cellular replication, shortening cells’ telomeres, damaging cells, aging body, making future recovery difficult. Can't say blame them. Yeah, let’s focus people money trying eat instead people billions cheat system contribute next nothing vs make. close loopholes big corporations complain employees needing food stamps? Jesus fucking Christ. people delusional lol oughta it.

How ""my massage therapist believes vaccines cause autism, get friends kids together infect everyone measles. are. third category: people whose mask fit properly, can't bothered/don't know make fit find one does. It’s honestly hilarious even needs said. mean duh. put condom balls, that's gonna prevent pregnancy. know downvoted.

Of course comfortable since god damn thing. People malicious compliance and/or selfishness. True.

[NPR: Coronavirus Maps: Severe State's Data September 28 brains incredibly smooth tiny even negligible amount oxygen loss cause total organ failure...apparently seen Florida improve lot summer hope doesn’t lead another spike. probably will. Sigh. talking 1 judge. Imagine Trump 15 years president. That's happens Germany, Merkel appointed countless judges since 2005, different system party bigger saying, process nearly transparent US. Mine too. try wear glasses top mask slide face. say maybe countries experiments minorities? Quote please.

Literally comment before, sure I’ll quote claim countries may similar differing explanations.

Hint: don’t “some similar” explanations. None them. fact countries similar low participation minorities prove reasons countries proves malpractice affected participation rates black people America? 

Because that’s literally experimental frameworks work world don’t true counter factual. investigate situations similar possible. You’re obviously familiar that. Doesn’t make less true. verifiable proof conclusion? sounds like personal opinion rather conclusion clear cut facts. arguments based fact, they're guess.

I’ve outlined arguments. I’ve made claim countries exact outcome, situations extremely diverse variable **you claim** predictor low participation rate US. still don’t understand you? You’ve made claim. I’ve responded argument countries exact outcome, even didn’t anything remotely similar happened US, overwhelming evidence something else causing minorities participate medical trials. I’ve even made clear minorities relation sympathy black community exact outcome. again, within country, clear cut evidence effect claim huge, actually not. all. 

Of course none proof. Proof doesn’t exist types questions. you’ve provided zero response above.  Yeah, big shit show here. person responding racist dork, probably lying. current job make sure people wear mask properly social distance whenever possible job. tell no, report them, could lead termination repetitive infractions. Oktoberfest Qingdao year. none Munich, year.

The expensive sentence pandemic 'Is really necessary?' heckin dollarinos saw guy outside local hardware store day. wasn’t wearing mask clearly allowed store yet worker inside bringing items inside store transaction sidewalk. carry extra masks offered one could go store

“I’m wearing diaper face” response. 

I guess camo shirt American flag dead giveaway. He’s asshole. 

I also pretty frustrated hardware store didn’t tell fuck off. Catering stubbornness isn’t helping anyone. it’s birthrate thing. America, Europe , japan, China replacement birth rates. Us population would declining without immigration. India’s low median age byproduct replacement rate BR (although it’s rapidly declined recently). dad says too. It’s ploy get Trump power. agree it’ll begin improve next summer. fake news, Marie. else got? surely fox moved now? worst people wear chin inside supermarkets. like, wearing wanting people think ok wearing telogen effluvium something recall class occur shock stress. also seen high fevers place significant stress body. Oh man... can’t. can’t. Really? Luckily avoided type, far. Exactly. reddit hates football way news gain way traction year made think lowest humans ever before. less spin comment. Sorry say see lot overweight people assuming/ claiming difficulty breathing (which inherently false) - might make feel hot sweaty mostly. fine. MLB finished season latter half almost cases. marlins incident mostly smooth sailing Stick question.

Do think asked wear mask harm others ""violence""?

Do think following traffic laws violence?


Do think following murdering people violence?

Depending answer... might psychopath like wearing trousers (pants non UK chums) dick hanging top waistband. like yeah.. Youre wearing them. bother? Absolutely, sadly, I’ve found immature person’s rejecting “authority.” circular breath breath nose mouth. I'm sure anyone wearing mask like care anyway breathes nose Mouth breathers? people remove mask talk put back done. Thanks. Look Poland. Can’t tell citizens wear mask properly, wants tell 
LGBT people live... Oh god... God damn mouth breathers. Interesting. Thanks sharing. Nah see they're mouth breathers anyway help Sweden Austria comparable populations, Austria 10% smaller. 

Assuming numbers reported reflect reality, Austria 796 Covid-19 related deaths since beginning 2020. Sweden 5890. harder compare numbers infected, strongly contingent test numbers methods definitions, take numbers reported, Austria 44041 infections, Sweden 92466. 

Germany 9545 deaths. That's twice Sweden, 8 times population. Basically unplanned experiment getting people stay home businesses closed, various amounts time depending city. Fair enough think that. Main point aren’t braindead. us consciously selfish. power fix that, don't. Honestly, anti-maskers popping supermarkets around live (rural southern USA), despite places requiring face covering enter. getting bolder, longer goes selfish assholes I'm going encounter, I'm afraid. Literally, figuratively metaphorically. Continue avoid type mask wearer opposition. Chances overall hygiene leaves “something desired.” I'm cry again. Either really, really dumb they're bully. Anybody agree you, right? I'm certainly makes idiocracy. idiots like make idiocracy nothing useful add discussion. disagree strongly, sure hell make right. economy decimated virus even killed 1% infected. That's textbook idiocracy. people die, don't. let's shut everything makes America America trample way life. That's liberal logic you. mind I'm idiot. like liberal scarecrow see daily walk, walking alone without another person 100 feet, mask on. Yeah, must idiot. Smh Yeah, could work ridiculous. Masks uncomfortable majority people. plenty arguments made masks, comfort one them. WB hiding numbers sure. Look trend never fluctuates 100. come state 90 million people exactly number cases everyday Let’s forget MLB also outbreaks continued common form virtue signalling see people like signalling superior think lacking empathy.  Covid thing half year yeah get sentiment behind saying. amount Americans willing cover eyes ears what's actually happening insane me. Yuk. World war Z less fun real life probably right.

It shitshow.

For otger Coronaviruses peak December April.

It could summer slow season. Lol like quit job even talking store management calling HR 3x still anything people wearing masks. 7 people walking around casually wearing call supervisor 2x could get vendor put mask on.

Now quit HR lady going take District Manager, lol. little late. 

So I'm saying is, store? #2. way complying still throwing tantrum. ""independent.co.uk"" article link think saw website called “Obvious shit everyone know education system failed us much need experts tell people”. People want wear mask. looks silly. wear damn mask. tyranny require anyways. even they're alone, they'll run fingers water .9 seconds, grab door handle hands still dripping dickwater.  point think remote better parent manage it. Today saw video classrooms kids there, spaced apart wearing masks. Didn’t look like happy. kindergarteners. TIL, thanks tip, I'll go get one later link me? (about MHC 1) ""no shit"" - literally anyone properly functioning brain Breathing still breathing whether done mouth nose. breath eating air digesting it. talk killed stomach acid take person coughs food eat it. someone coughs right front matter goes nose mouth way lungs. sure it’s hot foggy exhale? Don’t get wrong, always wear mask I’m public. delusions it’s comfortable wearing mask. Hence second paragraph... risk safety, expect better shrug. That’s works. one thing, breathing mouth still draws air lungs. doesn’t force stomach. There’s also ACE2 receptors mouth, it’s less nose. good question, headline says lower /their/ normal testosterone levels, compared previous tests. certainly never wrote UBI would 'fix everything' imply anything remotely sort regard. specifically wrote 'temporary UBI' regards help addressing hard lockdowns related pandemic, never occurred. see. thought since fatigue now, wanted see active covid infection. I’m sure test antibodies best, recently got IgG test Labcorp facility (US) came back within 24 hours. Test $10. 

Anyway, hope get feeling better! think people might forget noses. thing happens whenever plane depressurizes altitude. people forget put oxygen mask mouth nose. even though says every safety video demonstration.


people really asking hypoxia/covid Ok, I’ll bite, make sure plenty space people (strangers, vulnerable people would prefer breathe without aid machine). 

Also, might find mask “uncomfortable,” please don’t “die hill,” please don’t contrarian fun. Please know forced machine “breathe you” lot uncomfortable. still better mask, yeah, annoying see get people need move lives, would like move mine too

I feel much right now. Fauci start giving advice build batteries electric cars maybe epiphany. Pfft, like save class third year. That's freshman level shit. K. New Yorkers may broke, homeless, unemployed, least health saved countless lives along way. one MERS wasnt needed. took four hours adapt new coronavirus scientists Wuhan released genome back January. Everything since safety testing  Yeah fuck em prediction Florida seeing effects herd immunity months. much research dedicated much research dedicated COVID-19?  Bad bot #2 time. state/business requires wear mask. They'll get stopped wearing mask walking store. one stop wearing nose, even though useless, people conflict adverse.

For would nonchalantly say ""excuse me, mask slipped"" nosers. noticed half employees too, avoid plague. No. faintest. think fair infer something really basis knowing. Regardless he's behind closed doors, sure going countersignal WH election. Plenty criticize for, rock hard place currently. doesn’t seem taking social distancing seriously Italy

I'm reading much it. literally said. just....saw Florida altogether, excommunicate it? isnt reason stupidity nation called waves son. 

You open large venue cases show up. 

Simply look superspreader event midwest. couple weeks people begin see cases. 

In short dont ""believe"" anything simply look news. 

You know cause effect. 200k Americans died spontaneous death disease. TL;DR know future, mobile need click username, select ""start chat"" . Years ago, friend daughters (about 9ish time) Fan Expo (like Comic Con). walking floor, saw lady dressed (incredibly well) Leeloo (with orange suspenders). friend tells daughter ""go ask multi-pass"" (his daughter clue about). goes asks, Cos-player spins pulls card says ""I DO! multi-pass""

it funny. Ok. much expect save? I've quarentine since beginning. go every week two... going voting lives depend shared source Good luck!  lockdowns worth it. cost save lives. climate, save it, matter cost economy. always worth it. virus may like influenza, mutate, keep coming back, could disappear completely like nearest cousin, Sars-CoV-1.  data comes in, becoming clearer covid-19 dangerous prior influenza. large % deaths attributed covid due causes. 6% deaths declared covid actually covid (data studied March, CDC docs).  1: Someone terminal disease may caught covid died, actual cause death terminal disease. virus could last person.   2: Hospital admins ""encouraging"" doctors list covid death cert hospital gets reimbursed medicare substantially higher rates covid cases.  3: NYC decided attribute 3,500 deaths people died home covid, without evidence.  4: patient showed flu like symptoms, doctor could list death covid, even patient never tested. Mate reading way much it. Sorry feel insulted wasn’t meant way. Good luck guys  fact much money made companies selling shit food companies selling treatments health issues related obesity probably help. say that? Texas......

Yom Kippur 

righttttttttttt 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 confirmed cases predate wuhan. Stop spreading anti chinese propaganda. Show elected Democrat contradicting advice medical professionals.

The problem ""politicians,"" Republicans. super important I’ve read numerous articles suggesting people social distancing enough Spain I’ve read Italy.

You read articles people morons Italy pandemic sort control. mean pandemic control less morons neighbouring wrote open ‘we opened soon’. social distancing.

The difference blaming outbreak people's uncivic behaviour vast majority people excellent (wearing masks political issue here) different what's happening Italy I'm saying difference due policies implemented. leading cause death serious problem.

This something kills exponentially, around arguably 9 months, long term side effects well mortality. ##THIS.

This recent therefore relevant. Ontario, going back stricter guidelines we've spike cases due people getting relaxed.

Nightclubs strip clubs closed down, think last call 11pm bars. 

however Ontario opening Casinos.. that's fucking confusing. 

It really surprises amount people casually go places. family go necessities. Groceries, mainly, back school shopping, etc. sit restaurant well year. Fast food mobile order, go pick leave. (usually via drive through).

I seen friends since December. wife seeing people facebook pool parties day different groups people. Fun fact, full name is: Leeloominai Lekatariba Lamiatcha Ebat de Sabat. Works there's flu outside season. live big city, count permanent flu season, really work way said yet everyone around acts like things normal. mil fatigued shes oxygen months.  parts wants full capacity full capacity. 

But jobless numbers delayed... helps him. Yup, Florida model kind fails hard major issues impact tourism arrive.  think people's lives political? I’m speaking SERVICE Members husband. citizens aware service members treated property lose right informed consent. They're going get it. illusion freedom really gone head cares work it? relative did. government never ending leech. moved forward canceled weeks get $$$  got source this. Ive proponent high r0, failed notice consensus speak.

I read lots primary literature covid19, long estimates higher, consensus 3 less basic reproductive number (R0) COVID-19 initially estimated World Health Organization (WHO) range 1.4 2.5, declared statement regarding outbreak SARS-CoV-2, dated 23th January several published studies aimed precisely estimate COVID-19 R0. recent review written Liu et al. compared 12 studies published 1st January 7th February 2020 estimated R0 COVID- 19, finding range values 1.5 6.68.8 authors review calculated mean median R0 estimated 12 studies found final mean median value R0 COVID-19 3.28 2.79, respectively, interquartile range (IQR) 1.16.8 According findings, COVID-19 R0 would exceed reproductive number estimated Feb findings study suggest R0 values associated Italian outbreak may range 2.43 april 2nd. Masks/face coverings quite easy make. Sincere condolences family's loss.

From conversation, gather believe 1) depression serious mental health issue, get funk 2) overweight blame exercising (except tiny amount medically exempt) 3) regardless inheritance, opportunity, education obligation poor blame circumstances people mindless robots.

Is fair summation? amount covid deaths US likely equal decrease Heart Disease Alzheimers car accident deaths year case. History really repeat. whole world

&amp;#x200B;

ftfy potentially needing time work careful interpret kind data. Especially symptoms like fatigue problems concentrating (both abount 25% cases) nocebo effect.

For thorough examination, would need look exact questions asked survey. There's big difference ""Since recovering COVID, experienced problems concentrating."" ""Since recovering COVID, experienced problems concentrating noticable higher degree infection.""

Then need look whether controlled factors could influence psychological parameters. Anxiety, stress economic hardship etc.

I'm sure many people significant symptoms recovery, let's forget difficult survey things know little - difficult enough surveys things know lot about. So, please take numbers grain salt fact. Winter us awful sickness Covid. workplace often 35% sick shut influenza. think winter cold summers day us. Think-15 c seeing sun 5-10 days time. I’m disagreeing things you’ve listed. super important I’ve read numerous articles suggesting people social distancing enough Spain I’ve read Italy. Even wrote open ‘we opened soon’. social distancing. It’s thing. Sorry don’t think really disagree here. likely would listed comorbidities. Around 70% death certificates list one cause death. covid19 closer 94% causes many issues, like stroke, pneumonia, etc. Best comment ITT. thinking along lines.  Risk vs Benefit analysis shirking simple safety guidelines years come, socializing, makes seem like no-brainer. Life, quality life, precious. Around $75 insurance. Mine free, heard tell others. article say saying. I'm asking that's different happens country like Italy. I'm saying morons wearing masks social distancing.

Mask use 90-95% based data given authorities personal experience (I else think explains rising infection rate people careful wearing masks social distancing??

We reopened soon. Italy still ""state emergency"" reopened June.

We hire enough contact tracers. Madrid even bother hiring them, asking volunteers *august*.

We opened tourism. test visitors country origin (because would killed tourism due cost test).

We enough work inspectors.

Our health system overrun. I've contact someone tested positive covid (we never took masks social gathering thankfully) 10 days later able get contact health worker. self-isolate. people can't work home. interesting note: fact people inside winter doesn’t seem cause seasonality infectious diseases. phenomenon actually well understood. interesting article subject (from early pandemic). ""Florida residents testing positive rate 10 percent,...

""The World Health Organization set benchmark 5 percent local governments consider reopening businesses.""

Since number tests given gone drastically since beginning, number positives discovered goes it. baseline consistent. could decide policy based non-mathematical unscientific conclusions? actually understand Tuskegee experiments done black men? either uninformed disingenuous. Possibly both. especially galling Canada because, despite circlejerk well they're doing, there's massive backup PcR testing BC right literally one lab processing tests. believe it. current plan “vote” way it. wholesome naive Extensive testing. article (Google translate):

The Community requires professionals “never act own” always prior authorization Center's Management

A group nurses demonstrates outside La Paz hospital Madrid.EMILIO NARANJO / EFE
IDOIA UGARTE
Madrid - SEP 29, 2020 - 11:00 CEST
The Community Madrid prohibited health personnel teachers speaking media. reads internal statement released regional government Isabel Díaz Ayuso, urged ""never act own"" since always prior authorization Center's Directorate interview report request made. journalist. address designates professionals ""can represent institution best conditions.""


13 hours health center: ""We limit""

The intention standard promote “a positive image” cushion “any negative impact arises”. statement, follow-up publication broadcast requested know “treatment given information” “scope” public opinion.

All steps responsibility Communication Manager, one contact Hospital professional agree interests parties. also choose “the right time place” conduct interview. agreement reached, ""the opinion health institution prevail harm normal functioning center"" journalist always informed reason meeting cannot held, addition providing additional information ""when deemed necessary ”.

In event journalist follow ""the proper course"" tries contact health professional directly, ""redirect"" cabinet manage interview obliged ""as soon possible"" person responsible communication, ""in order guide adapt informative activity"".

The Ministry Health indicates question merely technical interview report, ""its convenience not"" determined, together management center health personnel. information requested exceeds scope institution, decision made management support person charge communication, turn collegiate Madrid Health Institute and, applicable, Ministry Health itself. Health General Directorate Media.


Lastly, statement warns health center ""cannot held responsible endorse statements made media"" health professionals occurred ""outside channels"" protocol.

The Community refers judgment Supreme Court January 7, 1988 concluded ""the physicians must request authorization director center intervene communication medium"" Good thing article literally zero reference antibody tests whatsoever. like shouting dog bad work day. Seriously roles deploys anything 24/7, using mail ballot regardless would say first year two able vote, really husband's fault. Also experience, military register vote wherever stationed mail ballot anyway Masks main factor here. Social distancing means squat unless outdoors. Indoors, air circulates within building, amount distance protect you. hold people authority lot responsibility backs accountable things say because?

Why, no, course not, silly.

You feel free pillory surgeon general saying something stupid.

You claim evidence surgeon general full shit guys don’t wear masks, nothing said. doesn’t make sense would listen first time suddenly listen now.
They morons. “freedom” right wing politics told masks bad.


this quote untrue fucking doesn't.

not even little bit. Silly blanket statement. new rapid PcR tests highly specific, rapid antigen tests getting (80-90%). rubbish rapid tests March. if.

You get COVID-19. goes dormant body. six months later reemerges begins shedding again. That...wouldn’t make sense considering Florida’s leadership republican; decision could interpreted putting base (old people) greater risk. understand massive difference antigen antibody tests, check entirely different things. dogs name literally joke. depends region's regulations state wide absolute worst thing could happen is.... nothing. fuckin conspiracy theorists anti maskers think even smarter science before. keep letting stupid evolve unchecked, we’ll know it. someone pointed another thread, needs sales tax money keep flowing since state taxes. supposed get vaccine flu season starts. stupid wait start.  What’s theory it’s countries? want chart SEVEN day average dip reports weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

The post title thankfully article headline, appears created person posed contains enough spin reverse direction earth's rotation. thinking thing, garbage article Ask much willing bet it, clean out. Easy money. Finland, shows whole country. 1.5 way, bad, great. never state mask mandate, county mandates. governor end ability levee fines noncompliance. Pre-existing conditions, wonder GOP wants get rid ACA. company offices China colleagues telling back work. Whether numbers true secondary now, truth already back normal There’s quite articles this. Here’s one else think explains rising infection rate people careful wearing masks social distancing?? CVS charge? normally get mine work work office shut probably summer insurance offers 3 places likely cost Uber paying pocket. it’s even close 1% People entire time though. Florida never stopped getting tourists. facts article match experience.

""Compared neighbours, Netherlands largely avoided strict restrictions now.""

Restriction March/April/May/June much stricter. 

""Earlier year Dutch government adopted strategy ""intelligent lockdown"" avoided strict national restrictions shut much public life many countries.""


Differences intelligent lockdown are:

* organised sports intelligent lockdown, sports continue without supporters (pro amateur).

* pubs closed, restaurants takeout intelligent lockdown. close 22:00 max 4 seated table.

* schools child-care closed except children essential workers. remain open. reports always make feel weird. pretty much never meet handful people time. even rare... try avoid speaking people pandemic anymore get. actually track waves disinformation floats society. think possible prevent spread new disease, time, system government currently set this. predictions correct see viruses pandemic risks increasing rate (as arguably started to) may something able set up. would involve strict regulations immediate action.

Who knows many viruses would need order get though. could predicted amazingly probable thing going happen? 400000 closer reality. Nuance several comorbidities regrettably died due Covid March.


These levels 'immunity' important tandem non-pharmaceutical interventions. nothing, R_t' = R0 = 2, 10% 20% make much difference. R_t' transmission based interventions, assuming people susceptible. R_t, actual transmission, R_t' x %susceptible. 2 x 0.8 = 1.6 = R_t still high. push R_t' 1.1, 20% infected, R_t = 1.1 x 0.8 = 0.88, declining # cases. Around R_t = 1, small changes big impact.


Because we've dropped R_t, mean we've dropped R0. R_t lower R0 people taking care. Based what? Herd immunity fully viable vaccine. Apparently country Italy, near city nearly 60 cases found ""rapid tests"" never reported national update. I'm surprised, disappointed point. 

But case used sinister government surveilance, would still remain public health tool away, ""or"" situation.

I reprase:

""Bread: food unhealthy?"" face mask orders anytime public unless seated outdoor restaurant. Hand gel going store. simple, really. Almost like masks social distancing actually works.

It works enough. We've mandatory face masks months Spain (and like 90-95% people actually wore them) we're coronavirus hotspot Europe.

It's simple put it. Masks social distancing work there's sufficient contact tracing open soon (we open sooner countries definitely sooner should) lockdown. really terrible way die, alone, starving breath.  really matter someone ""on way out"", pleasant way go.  Wasnt making enough headlines, update bigger number clicks. Sound lame. cringed thought policing people. would tell fuck cause mind upsets people like you. Mind damn business. true, bought cloth masks Target loose kept slipping. Tied small knot shortens earloop work great. life risks, lived personal risk-acceptance guidelines forever, continue shit! Glad study prove obvious. people almost bad antimaskers. trash door paper towel goes floor.  Shocking /s posted lib version lmao get high horse get fine guess. Well shit Sherlock Donnie? news, taking shit wiping knee equivalent 'not wiping all': experts. many dead kids acceptable you? make previously mentioned fact fact somehow? Sometimes I'm work go hours washing hands. Occasionally get big yawn mask slips past nose. want touch mask since hands washed extremely dificult slide mask upwards face bristles using inside elbow. it'll sit way minutes go wash hands readjust. saying approve reasons happens. False. least stops coughing droplets people much otherwise would. Great question. Varför, för att svenskar är allergiska mot självinsikt? I'm sorry, what? See Qatar study linked really seem like stuck late April. worse UK US? countries ban Swedes Danes today?

You're also completely dodging argument excess mortality. 

Finally, nothing intrinsically ""leftist"" imposing hard measures lockdowns population (of Denmark Norway neither). leftist policies paid sick leave, unemployment benefits universal health care. news: earth fact planet everyday store ""sir, please, put mask properly"".. people still believe cover mouth, eyes noise needed. Yeah kinda gotcha--thanks explanation uncomfortable. hurry put mask like accident. fixed ASAP itched nose. article required confirm phenomenon? I've ""I've got breathing problem"" ""I've got deviated septum""... say ""You get virtually everything city delivered door literally can't breathe mask 10 minutes."" 

I'm looking confrontations make scene, say piece go, let think I'm okay bullshit going unnoticed. mean R party 80's agree comfortable cover nose, stop there, even comfortable wear all. /s Malicious compliance. Fauci keeps saying ""end 2021."" coworker calls people ""dicknoses"" think SARS-2 behaves much like seasonal HCoVs SARS-1. Biggest difference transmissability a/oligosymptomatic spread. seasonal HCoV started like SARS-2 found way become endemic.
SARS-1 didnt that. transmissible enough deadly. 

So still oblivious general stance based on.

Btw dont write NIH blog think far qualified judge written there? formerly health 31 yr old here, got covid march still pretty debilitated. blow viral load getting covid dining indoors really high. high risk getting covid also high risk severe case (due heavier viral load).

Bars even worse. can't believe states like Florida permitting bars go back full capacity. Kinda like asbestos, damage take years fully kick shorten lives.

Great you’re careful, wrong. lung damage COVID improves time - Source, me, everything pulmonologists seen last six months working NYC. want :P

The police ticket dick hanging out. ticket nose hanging out. 

I’ve cracked history books. I’ve seen people chip greater good WW2. 

I’ve also seen Typhoid Mary didn’t give shit spread diseases. 

All laws don’t end gas chambers. lack laws end 200,000 dead far. 

But keep flying yellow flag feeling like rugged individualist. We've mask mandates CT since April. Still used it. No, everyone must wear mask time. Stop encouraging life without mask. Every fucking customer comes store this, chin strap technique .........and see problem whatsoever???


Bandanas literally equivalent wearing mask all, ""chase someone store car"" dont wear mask....

It's almost like one (YOU INCLUDED) actually worried corona want fake moral high ground people, pathetic. care Coronavirus, care pushing government control, congrats. forget regular fabric cloth masks people selling making crazy bucks, useless wearing sock forehead stay protected protect others :) Seattleite, protesters scared of, police. want shit kicked stayed home. perfectly fair though, many countries around world care whether he’s re-elected. America still pretty influential country world elections matter. think saying low risk different risk, still vigilant understand resenting measures, too, see quickly East Asian countries far less resources managed contain completely suppress virus. yes, partly people wore masks countries still. We've going 7 months people, especially work throughout 7 months hell, fed up. clamp nose part frames. air goes jawline It’s almost October. dead mean, already must consider mouth breathers, so...

Kind self-fulfilling prophecy. Nah they’ll probably close honest Cool death rate 3% Maybe elastic around ears loose? Could ""good"" option people *legitimately* struggle wearing masks due *actual* conditions, even though rare. Since better nothing. Although, probably quite rare *actually* big problem it. Israel many wear masks. much here, sure need expert 😑 lenses small? Mine pretty big - still see they’re lower nose. Well, Europe many countries Spain. good Spain. bankrupt landlords, guess what? fewer places rent from

How figure? going sales long-term owners instead renters? work? reusable masks, get [adhesive-backed aluminum nose Adhere near top edge mask, press bend clip shape nose. improve fit seal mask around nose. [Here's video demonstrates also push nosepiece glasses farther edge mask (past metal).

If using disposable mask, make sure pressing metal wire shape nose cheekbones.

Sorry phrased poorly. I'm hella tired words hard. Appearance intelligence without justify it.

And yes miss fact nose tactic removes doubt intelligence anyway called 'long hauling'. im 31 formerly active healthy, nowadays cant much trigger flare ass weeks. hundreds thousands millions (whether CFS persistent virus, actually thing..) data small number reinfected people point can't yet know severity reinfections distributed. said, zero reason assume random. biology, pattern sort. going make assumption point (which think shouldn't) 3 1 ratio suggests people get sick second time. (The article documents two cases.) compliance mask regulations already virus.

Also, sometimes feel like need air lower mask breathe nose File under: Things one require expert tell them! technically correct, reduction miniscule point irrelevant. difference functionally nil. 

You could right, reason believe true. people cover mouths mask instead coughing hand, that's big deal. think ""functionally nil.""

Your whole reply ""the ends justify means."" thanks. 

And would actually counter say getting little things wrong actually provides ammunition ""stupid people."" anti-masker come across inaccurate headline say ""yeah, trust experts! can't even get facts straight!"" throw experts. important get things right truthful people dumb think, especially able tell they're lied to. take COVID seriously still catch it. Yes us need reinforce mask wearing public spaces need reason unreasonable. Okay, mean... please enlighten us! 

Because **no** understanding thinking. one example, ever sneezed?

Giving upvote good faith prove lack malice. apathy Exactly. know many people try pretend there's anything remotely normal wearing face mask. Even best designs hot uncomfortable. Never mind adult acne they've causing ton people. “Common sense common.”

― Voltaire  Yeah quite obvious too. beathe noses breathe mouths. see many people walking around mouth open. figured something works you? There’s lot ideas thread.

One thing add success keeping fog lenses also breathe nose.

The last time got flu damn near killed me, getting virus option me. spread someone else got real sick/died I’m sure could live myself. no, thats long hauler sub require users submit reliable, fact-based information subreddit

That's case, go together one two friends, like small company case one bikes gets flat tire something, alone middle nowhere reason virus spread rapidly thoroughly need explain obvious point covering nose wearing mask necessary. guess mouth breathers. Ie, insult given idiots, people can’t breathe well nose. putting chainsaw legs promptly proclaiming “hey! look me! chainsaw dick!” greatly increases chances genitals mangled would yell someone that? Sounds right.  sun shield car tag tells remove driving Oh well MLB isn’t quite “in face” NFL. Could see Ichiro tackling runner rounding bases?

I listen guy's podcast. says New York City, given group people, 25% wear mask correctly, 25% wear mouth exposing nose, 25% wear chin, 25% mask all. funny true. 

A days ago went Spirit Halloween employee asked lady wear mask, proceeded wear mask get door, put chin. many Americans see mask pass get store, taking seriously. US probably flatten curve probably experience harsh second wave this. people respect mask wearing like Japanese do. better learn rules. don't, eaten sleep I’m sure did. dad gave her. 

You jumping “wear mask” article nothing masks family careful find mask culture right annoying overbearing. Prime example. also, alarming number people understand breathing works  He's saying lockdown extended, he's saying lockdown end abruptly, 100% closed 100% open overnight. It'll gradual best ensuring public safety. 

I'm getting real tired sealioning here, especially people refuse read articles. wearing mask rule stating must wear mask. wearing mask think mask anything stop spread coronavirus. Therefore, whether chin, nose, forehead matter them. nose lot less hot. Last January sick. sickest ever been, whatever kicked ass. horrible cough worst fatigue ever. Every day struggle keep moving. accompanied brain fog. stay focused task got easily confused. assumed stress causing recovering shock dad suddenly passing away November. cough fatigue go away. got February March, never got back 100%. late February, everyone contact gotten sick including 3 yo son. took urgent care horrible cough fast breathing. doctor said never heard anything like cough lungs. treated croup got better within days. pandemic became mainstream. symptoms matched January family had. 9 months later still recovering. I'm still self. wonder many people Colorado January. really pretty quickly well. felt night sure took less 6 months. carry around bottle liquid ass lmao biggest hope post corona world, automatic everything everywhere. Doors, sinks, soap dispensers, toilets, paper towels, everything. brains size peas. mean, point plain dumb still think whole thing hoax. guess one problem wide spectrum symptoms. may know 10 people positive, half asymptomatic, half felt like flu think bad. Perhaps even yourself, felt like cold. I've unlucky enough family friends die, get sick though. top used work hospital, still friendships people work there, including critical care staff. They've filled bad disease be. that's get heated it. would lie? would nurses doctors respiratory therapists lie? infuriating. Im stupid fuck, could told wearing mask parts designed cover effective. like putting band-aid underneath cut. However, majority humans stupid fuck, presenting logical solutions isnt really option. Also, according basic common sense.... worst part pull mask talk you. point even wear one all. one thing pandemic shown LOT stupid people everywhere. mean. sound ridiculous. hope youre sarcastic. person infected child wear mask, though? workplace required wear face shields INSTEAD masks. didnt choice. change UK rules wear masks they're generally much better. doesn’t. *is* evil. Kan du utveckla? Säger inte att det är så, men get där lät lite translate-igt Same. wait someone open door prop foot door stopper. face shapes equal!! tried close 20 masks found one won’t fog glasses. tie kind. may noticed readily available sale store. reality masks useful social distancing practiced ...or even wearing decent mask. Lately I've seeing people wearing weird plastic shield things worn front mouth nose, something like inch away face huge openings top, bottom, sides ..... they're bizarre understand people told ""that meet guidelines"". Racist glasses don’t steam up. hedge funds fine Memorial Day Labor Day, incidence weekly infections went wild roller-coaster ride, reaching peak nearly 38 cases per 100,000 school-age children mid-July leveling 34 cases per 100,000 kids late August. first full week September, cases fell 22.6 per 100,000.

It's interesting article quote much rose. give quote. ""roller coaster ride"" essentially shows infection rate varied nearly quite .02% I've run industrial processes stable. ten minute ride altitude varies 3 feet much roller coaster. Better question people drive mask they're person car? 2nd generation Hispanics grew used trash toilet paper. baffled many years explained. 

The worst hanging hot chick course assumed visible hers... Odd. exact comment posted several hours ago posters history doesn’t show it. anything else.

What to? can't stand smell breath... LOL. one arguments. haven’t countered single argument anything hysterical rambling, unfounded claims outright lies. Throwing arguments someone who’s debating technique Reddit equivalent throwing plates ground smearing shit wall advance discussion further. spreading community? hospitals getting filled up? 'cases' going up? work appetizer food processing plant I’m one people wear correctly (mainly cause wear form glasses dog really easy suck up) case hit line shift. I’m gonna surprised doesn’t hit next week :/ see article family took every precaution still got virus? “mask up” conclusion coming based one case?

I’m anti mask anti treating masks like panacea I’m remotely accepting using Indefinitely. short term fix far I’m
Concerned I’m tired PR around them. 

It’s absolute tragedy happened child. truth that, kids, common flu bigger threat covid. One example doesn’t change that. brutal. ? can’t show common courtesy innocent. Unbelievable. Based comment, tell low IQ never well.  3rd group: people glasses. 
I wear mask everywhere every glasses decide fuck shit up. narrow face bought maybe 20 different masks can’t find one fits face well enough prevent this. never confront someone wearing mask wearing wrong. however give look says “are really dim”?! 👀 people bragging NFL perfectly safe first week probably show admit wrong. Wow great point, guess wear masks would *hope* brought county jail, certainly classier.  USA whole TWICE number cases (7 day average per capita) Melbourne 8 weeks ago, went full crazy strict lockdown. seeing sacrifice bear fruit, relatively normal life back 3 weeks time. That's way squash curve. USA, hand, actually opening things double spread already! observe countries strategies worked out? They're stupid, selfish weak make difficult decisions, simple that. course, death rate go up, he'll caught pants down. one puts chainsaw near genitals--or least hope not. breathe nose air gets trapped inside mask mouth beard get steamy sticky—also lot ppl really rank breath noticing first time. understand people they’re less risky areas outdoors, it’s take break situation—but obviously nobody indoors close others Taste Beast ™️ Surgical masks filter air either. N95's filter air, surgical masks.

I think shields block largest droplets, probably get stuck surface shield. probably much prevent aerosols spreading. news water wet... Thinking clever [Israel's ""three-week"" lockdown guys think instances like this? believe there's truth skeptics' accusations many governments ""shifting goalposts"", governments right thing? 

In case, people *will* get mad, refuse comply, government provides something certain date, refuses thing date comes - irrespective whether refusal good faith not. problem assertions ignoring difference culture opportunity make average daily life.

I'm going use example. used job lived 10-minute drive away from. live extremely hot humid climate, majority time, though could've walked there, I'd sweaty sticky, make-up running mess time got dressed office. ACCEPTABLE arrive work way, here. Nobody walks/bikes work expected look windblown sweaty.

I bike condo complex live bike racks, 3rd floor safely wrestle bike stairs. also bike racks office building, place store bike either.

The one good thing job required physical activity, fantastic. spent hours job every day cleaning, unboxing, light physical activity. 

Then closed local office. next job (after months searching, ideal) 45-minute drive away. 100% desk job. 7:15 morning 5:15 night, driving desk job itself, I'm completely sedentary. try get 15-20 minute walk lunch, get walk around building some, nothing like job job required physical labor. also absolutely choice drive job.

Needless say, suddenly find really struggling keep handle weight. time get home I've spent 11+ hours dedicated work, hours left end day relax/exercise/prep meals/cook. Now, still responsible eating well exercising? Sure! see **difference jobs, culture regarding transportation, put heavy, HEAVY pressure healthy lifestyle?** 

And mine mild example. I'm married, kids. lot Americans, especially poorer ones, work multiple jobs, encounter transportation difficulties, crazy schedules really preclude exercise naturally included way life fault own. us live walk- bike-friendly areas! Many us struggle inadequate childcare. Many us struggle mental illnesses crippling. every damn corner, there's temptation lying wait - fast food, prepackaged food. lot people also live ""food deserts"" here, fresh food hard find might reach vehicle. make mistake, fast food addictive. tastes good, quick dopamine rush, ready right now.

I'm saying excusable, I'm saying fair consider bigger picture. think anyone disputes numbers largely influenced reaction Covid pandemic. needed expert analysis? Guy front supermarket barely covering top lip. Knobhead Years neglecting dental hygiene. sudden come back bite nose. Useful Northeast (33.6% New York!) particularly useful, except snapshot time, sunbelt.  RemindMe! 6 Months Customers don’t threaten gun come shop. think it’s weird “programming” shit government trying throw “oh don’t tread me” also people fine letting people die don’t want cover face :/ hate really informative interview going pretty much everything vaccine that's currently development, pricing, availability, time frames, influences, etc. safe? so, really see issue. I've seen sister family plus parents throughout entire thing 4 month old twins. Seems sad see family long everyone safe. Especially holidays. older relatives  Underrated Hmmm..... always hoping least PA/NP would kinda step right direction better lifestyle, seeming like case :/ 7 months, kibd normal now.
The acne thing real though. Sigh  Ha yes, putrid orange jello marbled lard. Don’t know feeling bit foggy sick much worse unemployed losing home? Come on! Eh, sadly they’re wrong though. get wanting avoid nail-biting reporting, read news frequently AP/Reuters bland af, can’t avoid reality (hopefully) masked people everywhere public frequent cleaning. Curious think could negative health effects breathing heavily ""like shocked"" cotton day day months? Thats crazy efforts aren’t mandated state level.

Even Canada, Eastern Provinces banned travel Quebec beyond, unless good reason. that, drastically lowered cases almost year. small outbreak.... American came didn’t self quarantine two weeks. face masks affect O2 sat. people idiots pray eventually learn wrong. people obsessed hard lockdowns check numbers talking...

BTW think Argentina one longest lockdowns world... 

Lockdowns necessary health system going collapse deaths start rise much. tweet 👻 mother says: it’s like walking around silly hanging PRE-covid. Like I've saying whole time, covid seems scary talk ways talk anything else, pay attention things we've never payed attention past.

Don't think funny fear-pornographers responsible news outlets found single ""person died denied care overwhelmed hospitals"" story? every anecdote tell us unspeakably horrible coronavirus is, single story type. serology surveys much higher percentages. confirmed cases arent good metric. easy guys, want outside buy cake pizza mask fell nose felt like crimmnal quickly fixed beign hot sun felt like passing out.
ALSO delete Facebook today bcz ranging hatred lockdown made head hurt. Oof.. imagine someone eye-ache kind, half paying attention reaching Visine... pretty sure still hand waving state.

The public seems believe scientists everything, influenza us *really* long time never able fix either. (I know might change more.) Yes places don’t seemed learned anything even though death rates similar. exception Italy stupid question ask ever since COVID I've noticed random chest tingling stuff, minor left arm pain, sometimes feel like palpitations. potential symptoms heart condition brought COVID, so, stop lightest exercise? know place solicit medical advice trying get back shape. intend get blood work done ECG possible ASAP. 

FWIW, I've asked couple professionals informally unsurprisingly said nothing still scary Conservative: _adj._ Moderate; cautious. diarrhea. doo doo diarrhea. suppressed information, warning weak best halted interstate travel actively encouraging international travel. Yes knew dealing everything possible let spread. China pay every penny damages caused. that's future.

Babis lies everything, that's nothing new. He's populist. would never vote him. covid could potentially wipe huge portion electorate, so... played mention public perception city terrible waste land filled homeless garbage one stayed. accurate all. left came back surprised lively city even economic/social issues facing. I’m saying want tourist Florida come back today tell relatives Florida it’s actually really nice think death zone safer, that’s problem. Cant wait society cripples completley ignored. Lol. i've multiple people tell ""Trump fixing medical problem! He's reducing prescriptions!"" i'm like....Who gives fuck cost those? expensive drugs manufacture rebate programs poor(er) people. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem insurance cost, lack insurance anything (high deductible, network, etc) high cost actual appointments. Friend spent 300$ one regular annual, think 150-200 labs. (No insurance.) pay $500 month health insurance, insurance dick broken ankle ER visit due deductible. Shit cost 1k. (ER visit, 4 x rays, ortho glass splint.) $50.00 crutches, $50.00 paying third party hospital contracts READ x rays. 

&amp;#x200B;

THAT needs solved. scam. weird think places pandemic. UK restaurants booked, fewer tables order socially distance pubs table service (more recently, close 10pm). Every restaurant, pub, café etc also Track &amp; Trace. Wrong. Florida's death rate far less NJ NY. older population. Also, far less damage economy. Feels like still little early that, least extensive single cluster information anecdotal stories. Sometimes, certain conditions take decade come fruition. think long usually takes smoker develop health issues. usually extended period fine, also correlated younger, issues start mounting frequency severity.

Not mention imagine lot researchers currently preoccupied active infections trying minimize spread.

While smoking may best analogy Covid smoking continuous damage time Covid overcome (we presume), point issues take years develop.

But studies, would interesting see, tho would bit skeptical given factors thorough would be. doesn’t seem taking social distancing seriously Italy left womb. that, give shit anymore. get graphs? Remember many people get infected, adds huge numbers. 0.1% people 1 1000. fact lot people.

Very roughly 160 million people USA 44. (If someone bothers calculate precisely, would cool. really fast show magnitude.)

0.1% 160 million 160.000. 

So everybody got it, 160 thousand young(ish) people would die.

So like 3 times USA lost Vietnam war.

So yeah USE ought devote 3 times ressources fighting covid fighting Vietnam. (That based assumpion care people 45 dying. like die either, could calcutale well.) oo tell 'em think couple logical motivations- political ""victory"" mostly conservative anti-lockdown crowd motivation vote red November, spread Covid widely discourages voter turnout, etc. think simplest likeliest answer economic advisor raised red flag, DeSantis used justify complete repeal measures. exclude previous goals partial motivations, however. want show decisively reopened everything, they're hoping fallout bad election day.


Are people avoiding restaurants limited capacities, there's spread restaurants? states aren’t allowed run deficit? Without federal aid they’re forced reopen then??? Canada strict immigration rules. It’s easy simply packing driving north Asymptomatic people.

There's chance 50% people unknowingly carrying virus around. Give simple cold flu we're spreading Covid like mad. doesn’t either. Check post history dude complete moron One person every 40 seconds across world suicides.

Most result depression.

It 'light mental disease' - hope never suffer loss someone close you.

There correlation poverty, obesity, mental health.

Are society's failings entirely fault individual? I'm dissing you, third world country experience everyday last 50 years fact still exist. Hell Afghanistan war 50 years still kinda travel lol. 

We survive this, unless weaker Arabs Florida income tax. uses sales tax. theme parks, snow birds, partiers tourists spend lot generate sales taxes course jobs small large businesses. Probably. That’s pubs closed completely. eventually gets worse. Idiocy case countries less harsh restriction less it, dont see that. Yeah, cuz global virus American election cycle. Come nov 3 Canada willhave forgotten too? Agree, podcast TV/radio appearances beginning worth gold explain backgrounds, actions, measures etc. We're talking website, app. remember long time ago someone proposed theory reason discovered intelligent life universe yet civilization reaches point learn split atom, inevitably destroy result it. 

I propose change - People like *this* reason intelligent species go extinct. What's word? CDC lost credibility. Russian disinformation political monsters destroyed messaging. Everything Florida concerning best times. Plus whole lot middle upper middle people also. gotten lucky, live good job market, mostly secure jobs, health issues. Sure maybe bad time see self responsible hard-working made through. Thing others got hit harder think made though also. even know USA come first wave talk fatigue psychological stress... could also effect isolation fear. pretty sure skeptical old George days. fucking starters:

**Get rid GOP**

**Sabotaging** ""democracy"" Yes. Sweden ""Fauci"", Trump charge. Fauci fessed lying masks protect medical stockpiles, Swedish Fauci still denial one excuse next. Ah yes American stupidity. Carry on. Nothing see anymore. America government people lost. Nothing changed yall scared fully change it. Biden wont change shit either. get taken like rest them. America country. business white supremacy think right people live. see problem dont act always control you. Great stuff american people. Keep complaining.

When see users (not you) happy current situation, bragging easy can't wait carry years come. brag fact normality may return next year stresses makes lash ; excuse explanation.

I honestly, seeking meant anything i've said personally, unfortunately got caught bout impotent rage apologise. seem remember saying 60-65 K, Italy going worst (so already clear virus capable point)  usually look away blood draws decided brave one time watched. Ended one time fainted due blood draw. Lesson learned, watch unless really sure sight blood bother you. might want look details there, much want put light specific article, think best discover much missed piece news. Found tweet thread extremely informative! Covid situation also less ideal Brazil, India Spain well parts Europe. personally 5 different types masks. one easy breathe barely makes difference difficulty all. Another mask mine suffocate like plastic bag tied head try inhale sharply. hard tell ones ok work think lightweight thin masks help Besides age seem loading dosage matters. even younger wear masks nothing. 
A true flu always knock ass even live. Unless unlucky things last time flu totally knocked feet. know plenty survivors say 30 age bracket lived we're knocked feet unlike stuff years. Florida remained consistent case demographics since June. older Trump voters rural areas probably said something else reality that’s PC version it. Back March, country malaysia's political game also dissapeared altogether sudden, like literally went 100 0 week time, voice heard hero Dr noor hisham, lead manage get pandemic control despite 15000 religious gathering contribute later big cluster. 

I surprised despite dumb politicians used seem, least know time shut up. IDK mean that.

The article Conversation treating USA UK, author seems aware rest world exist.

USA UK terrible food, extremely way migh high carbon. Either much sugar soo much fat. well, culture anti-physical exercise. 

At least experience people around 20 UK/USA less willing take short walks like 15 minutes walk staircases 65 year old would Denmark. pretty mindblowing me.

My impression normal thing UK/USA never use body avoid - small group fitness/sports nerds.

We also many fitness nerds, very, people nothing physically - almost possible here, people would need bycycle. 

Kids go school bycycle instance, walk. College age people use mainly bycycles. Like this: Damn hellTrump!! I'm never voting this...oh wait state issue direct hate President like really really doesnt. Flu doesnt cause brain heart damage 70% people get it. However, Italy still one worst countries Total Deaths Per Capita 

I think people know this. post *current* situation regarding spread virus. hold people authority lot responsibility backs accountable things say because? Oh god Sweden *easing* already non existant restrictons. 500 people seated events 50 people rule wont used resturants.

Are actually nuts? Wtf going there? 28 upvotes? amazing read! Thank inspiration stay blessed! GOP dun care depends kind mask on.
Its hard tell youre buying online something thats lightweight sometimes breathe pretty well. able run 1.5mi couple days ago good mask whole time. hand, mask bought back may seriously suffocate try breathe sharply all. *Only* 324. Jeez. Large-scale death really turn individuals numbers. Well, wish simple. measures - face masks, gel, seating outdoors - place Madrid, Spain, look cases (here). must something else too. There’s shame looking away.    
I focus keeping arm relaxed.   
I blood drawn couple weeks ago look away.

Lol. actually thought going big boy start acting professionally, sudden we're talking mass casualties... no, actually doubled corrupt incompetence proper leadership needed most. disgusting person thing told back MARCH.

I'm waiting find local pediatrician take drive-thru clinic Saturday. may it. Keep fingers crossed us! BS. It’s pseudoscience fuck say caste die lmao

It's word caution others similar weight health.  I'm summer George tell heart poor spirits feds run trillion dollars debt? It’s low cost highly accurate rapid test. Uses strip paper gives results 30 minutes. Standard PCR testing used countries takes lot longer least 5 times (maybe more) expensive also needs expensive equipment. supposed make testing faster easier compromising accuracy, required control pandemic. think also happend Italy first wave. people wear masks want ""because to"", might take social distancing desinfecting seriously. countries facemask rules Italy yet well. People need understand need change behaviour prevent shitstorm missery weeks months later. dutch saying ""when calf drowned, well filled"" (theremight english equivalent know of) , means take action something bad already happened. guess many people seen calf drown yet. law state.

Messages coming FDA agreement messages administration installed spokesperson PR experience instead scientific experience. mean, take pick things could done faster unified would vastly improved impact virus...

What mess. worst part know we’ll learn nothing country, maybe we’ll even get worse. taunt coronavirus Lol anyone listen players speak things first got canceled biggest concern . College huge escape kids get scholarships. everything world racist . Watch shows like last chance U live hoop dreams you’re familiar . It’s insulting like ones fall category tell  false negative tests could also test negative gets tested soon exposure. need stay home quarantine. People breaking quarantine one reasons continuing spread. sure needed go Thursday, food supplies, ask friends drop off. can’t go isn’t closed whole world American? Places closed us closed every country it’s Americans can’t visit. Seriously, basically dictatorship... Putin orders would vaccinated.. 

So either confidence vaccine, want save lives, wanting test vaccine people countries he's giving countries.

If vaccine worked case numbers dropping? anything really. get tired self righteous people complaining masks, mask completely work small company see boss walk without washing hands time  reason lot people don’t wash hands using bathroom. cleaning homes properly. eating right food exercising enough. reason come work late, don’t really contribute go home early. People lazy won’t comply rules consequences aren’t obvious enough. Amen! comfortable. benefit fogging glasses. cringe ...and many people world? long approval process going take? many anti-maskers going fine vaccine? many pro-maskers gonna totally comfortable something that's extremely short term testing? ironically see fair number seniors this...just uplifting stories seniors surviving Covid, stats you... need ingest lot get actual symptoms though. One partial might enter body 2k away enough anything.

It's evidence close people outdoor areas protect like everybody Facebook thinks. ""you can't get outside"" constantly see said. proves get outside somebody coughs 20ft away direction. understanding never got far, would also problem, yes. Amazing claimed advance agenda observation, information evidence. Assumptions aren’t facts. would call science. slightly uncomfortable breath mask. Thats least half it.

It feels good end day work office Im way home town empty enough take mask breath normally.

I guess naked noses cant stand mask veey undisciplined. long there? 12+ hour drive without coming contact people? I've never seen people ""chin-wearing"" done unless block, far 6 feet.

And said complaining comments I've seen mostly people SAID saw driving. (who tf cares then?)

Sorry saw close up, make case then. call argument Strawman already stated counter-points original comment. am. also taxes going towards better schooling. lol   link shows US still closed countries...and countries open strict requirements. American's can't even cross border Canada yet. sure utilize google find information yourself. I’m really business research free internet strangers. possible, also time, like week, even need breathe heavily! brain adjusts ""lower level"" oxygen (not really, brains panic first think that).

We adjust faster people move Colorado. takes 6 months! wearing mask found equivalent wearing mask. Well said. Nice synopsis. yet least 30 people reading comment. fucking mumbo-jumbo geting ridiculous!! I'm American love NFL, 2 frigging millions fines coaches wearing masks. Fu isn’t obvious? wonder Shampoo instructions. wanted take away risk producing vaccine, billion dollars less important hundreds thousands lives. I'm well aware this. UK consistently 6 8 weeks behind Italy (at beginning), France Spain throughout this. 1:1 match enough make conversation talking numbers family friends. makes sense me. Taking 2min grab microfibre cloth pocket bag giving glasses wipe seems lot safer pulling mask 10min waiting glasses warm Time get *REHABILITATED!* Tell people plane yesterday Ugh literal constant battle. hemoglobin always low end fine I'll fight ferritin test come back like 5-7 45-50 doc like oh wow YEAH TOLD YOU.

Anyways lol. hair loss WORST looks stupid growing back too! pro trump subreddit resents low iq comment can't believe many dickheads wear masks without nose wires. many assholes there. Florida parks reopen while. layoffs happening California honestly governor done poor job. Disney begged publicly guidelines plan eventually reopen state ignored them. feel like giving fuck, wanting breathe fresh air. defending it, thats realistically reason Anyone 40 risk death. sure thought seniors die Well said. 275 patients too.

I think big news big impact already hospitalized patients. 

If shown successfully treat people get really sick Covid, think could change approach whole pandemic enough doses made.  data released today non-hospitalized setting I'm hopeful effective too. I'm sure anyone reasonable intelligence needed experts one Texas Canada, say. Well you’re still wrong. They’re gonna let 7 cases stop season Sturgies involved dozens packed bars.... look around, stringent masks requirements fewer things open. Chicago required masks months high compliance, yet outdoor playgrounds closed date criteria opening. businesses reduced capacity (best case scenario) vaccine distributed. Thing fully understand immune response yet. research made clear early innate response type 1 interferon secretion seem determine whether things go downhill not. seem pretty dark entails *effective* adaptive response currently. say thing hurricane coming know well advance? long tracking virus? weekend already lower. surge starting wire strips totally effective me. Sometimes adjust general 99 percent solve fogging issue. whole story single city. I'll grant live isolation, data supported idea herd immunity achieved number weeks evidence greatly diminished daily infections, see suddenly increase apparent change policy. out-of-town visitors bringing virus resulted rebounding infection rate.

As others stated here, vaccine strategy may never work antibodies indeed die quickly. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm sure Nixon, Reagan too, Governor California. Today ""no fucking shit"" Hmmm good call, need limit orgies 9 people max then. Sure going lot disappointed people though Maybe opposite day.  good man MN never spouts fear, facts. want scared, listen talk wasting disease.  mom works one hospitals. Definitely random ware. separate flairs ""sounds cool used year least"" vs. ""this shit actually used right now/soon"". bad news immediately effect whereas good news almost always experimental shit see time soon. No...they didn't. single major outbreak linked outdoor events, regardless activities mask compliance. least health saved countless lives along way.

Seems 2024 gonna different demographic historically red districts. proof models simulations reflect real world situations. Gotta love gas station worker blows nose goddamn hotdog angry many people see this. get pissed could punch them. Honestly wish better way handling this. It’s “not wearing mask” extra steps. Low stick gatherings less 10 people wear masks. *Headup Assitis. known terminal cases, sometimes others. think headline article misrepresent part issue. 

“If someone’s got nose peeking out, it’s really different wearing mask,” Furness said.

I believe true. many people telling us mask helps protect others possible exposure. mouth covered lower risk spreading virus significantly. may protect wearer much making difference main reason supposed wear one. Wear right course, lets lie people wearing one all. saw dozen halfwits grocery store. HIV + SARS, yummy. Anyone else bothered this? brand new disease know it, better. Cancer heart disease still control covid. like wearing condom balls, people. Come on. You’re underscoring problem without offering solution. Send folks cash. removing store enough? wish every place that. Kids smart raise smart. mean, always, course, due external factors, parenting basically sets personality first years, determines react external factors. Mutations could easily bad us. Enough mutation may cause vaccine fail. Furthermore mutation increases lethalty ultimately self-defeating that's consolation people die it. somehow archived 1918 flu lethalty,for example, would terrible, yet infectiousness enough last several years. Haha I've driven place before. Indian wedding venue. majority protesters least wore masks. they're actually important cause like police fucking murdering black people impunity. Orthodox people choose wear masks continue gathering nothing happening. different Karens going shopping without masks ""MY FREEDOMS"". can't see difference there, know tell you. everyone covered mouth mask, isn’t air you’re breathing nose safe?... particles come nose talking/breathing? Absolutely yes. forget tell people wash hands? don’t recall camo shirt deliberately coordinated camo hat, I’m sure punisher sticker back truck somewhere. article Walt Disney World Resort Flordia reopened — albeit strict health measures decreased capacity — since July. You’re totally right. know I’m young. yeah, women especially made feel way. believe may a... umm, ya know. Joke? far, I'm hearing *can't* mass produced.

So far, thing mess effectively mass produced virus itself.

This winning looks like. people America vaccinated, virus cannot spread here. Viruses spread someone gets infected pass couple people. vaccinated, becomes much difficult one person get it. even someone get it, becomes difficult pass on.

It matter Sierra Leone enough vaccines. long people Americans come contact day day either immune already immune due vaccine, virus spread minimized.

There 350 million US, 350MM need vaccine. Young, healthy people never great risk begin with, half country. rest vaccinated short order. Pfizer production make 200 million doses end *2020*. Others also production. approved, huge stockpiles available immediately, way.

Fear friend. COVID reduced rare thing within next 6 months. Society managed convince anyone 25+ (to 30's) old. way making people feel bad foster insecurity imo. harmful. aware she'll even harder time breathing gets covid? Waiting another two months although Pfizer, vaccine manufacturers, USFDA repeatedly said corners would cut regarding safety. 

People begging vaccine we’re nearing finish line couple, want press pause. 

Makes sense quite convenient. /s

i dont know cali tho mass protests mayor took part okay? answer no, evidence coronavirus history ever causing cancer, another bizarre figment imagination

On hand, know pretty well people cancer get treated, get diagnosed way late, die. That's something actually happens, real world. Don’t know price said 200,000 doses month starting next year. needed break work went reddit phone stall 🤷🏼‍♀️ Serious question: pull mask people around outside? bigoted. saying choices actively causing harm need quit it. feel exactly evangelical Christians continue hold massive church services. Based evidence difference infection based skin colour? forgot subreddit filled scientific illiterates.

Didnt notice came room using laughing gas, another woman first. Well cough still better mask mouth. bite nails...I’m motivated stop

And happy cake day! saw someone fast food place day. Fucking infuriating. belong wards give Texas much credit Wave 2 devastating skipped right wave 3.  what's electric cattle prod go days? glad go offices anymore.

masks one things help. get it, need businesses open. masks would help keep people safer businesses open.

florida, wrong you? That’s point: virtually none. schools knew they’d ***cases***; kids start dying, they’ll change plan. He's wrong. let guess, even one death unacceptable people like you? crime. society sick let happen, failed children (and parents) like this. yes bigotry called out. said people color gender sexual minorities would flagellated here, antiSemitism soft bigotry gets free pass. Thus majority
of hate crimes NYC last year violent attacks Jews Same. Filthy. Sad true I'm fine this. could anyone be.

I think tunnel vision, say made great points, I'm reconsidering position. downloaded fitnesspal? habit scanning logging everything eat great motivator reduce consumption think lot people realize slipped down. I've seen people complain nosers end nose even. I've pointed even realize. used wearing masks. 

I think hurts say ""I know realized, mask slipped nose want risk getting sick"" give benefit doubt prompt fix it. make snide comment something, guess know intentions point. KNEW someone going pull this. I'm blaming group people selfish fucking choices. Jewish common factor. I'm wanting stop Jewish, I'm wanting wear mask face stop huge gatherings like everyone else doing. make anti-Semitic, jfc. Well, I've learned, trying enforce mask wearing get assaulted killed. Like putting diaper around baby's pee-pee parts, ass. get wet, get shit over. Tell shirt Punisher skull it. Please. even that. recently confirmed already suspected least Madrid (Comunidad de Madrid) include cases reports.
I live village where, based official data yesterday number cases started confirmed last two weeks zero. Surprisingly three friends got positive PCR period heard couple more, although first hand information.
IDK historical cumulative data corrected anytime later doubt it. Anyway even would still two week delay.  “There two constants universe, gravity human stupidity.” We've known virus almost 10 months. course know yet cause cancer even gotten grasp cells enter, nevermind whether characteristics see cancer causing viruses.

Fortunately, researching it. thread actually about.

I'm pretty sick political trolls mucking everything up. I'm tired. guys getting paid this? Go back whatever political sub came from. I'm sick ""but sweden! economy! let old people die, caring expensive anyways!""

 Btw, Sweden's economy still contracted, much others. Hardly worth fatality rate still see growth. Someone understand exponential growth. 0.2% population dies every year, long go extinct? one topics get unjustifiably angry people make joke it. I’m weird. Exactly! specifically college-aged. wouldn’t symptoms Covid-19, symptoms would mild they’d think it’s allergies. would get test? country, wasn’t easy free.

Then boom: college need get tested. re-tested. schools it’s week, even more.

Of course they’re going find cases! Tons before. 18-22yo’s weren’t tested Aug school loomed. coronavirus skeptic. Disney reopened literally parks around world single outbreak traced one parks. It’s easy say “don’t go Disneyland pandemic”, people don’t realize literally Disney world Disneyland two LARGEST single site employers entire country. location employs 30,000 people each, factory facility office entire United States. Disney huge CRUCIAL employer. Uhm...duh? need increase staff size supplies massive scale. happen.  easy. been, nationwide, 66 deaths involving covid 19 persons age 0-15 years old per CDC 9/23/20.

I 3 kids age range, count times safety house/yard since end March one hand. lot friends kids age range. amount activity. 

Once schools go back, imagine lot needless deaths kids age range. Kids cannot expected maintain social distance, wear mask correctly, good hand washing practices touch face. don’t see happening. opted enroll kids virtual entire school year. 

If ends shit show expect be, thankfully won’t part it. maybe absolute morons. 15% population gets virus weeks, hospitals fill up, people stop going outside, start wearing masks. No, true. Unless commit friends done whole life, surely perish. ah yes blame Jews plague. traditionally gone well history hasn’t Unlike federal government, states run deficit spending.

Unrelated point something wish every single person would understand ranting local city government state hasn't

✅sovled homelessness 
✅implemented transit network high frequency high coverage free fares 
✅built blocks blocks social housing

Pretty much every social good profitable run, therefore requires Federal assistance form. Anti-politics broke Americans' brains. want nice things pretty decisively opposed type sweeping action deficit spending would take make things reality.  It’s rising like places, it’s slow low level (20 ICU 12 couple weeks ago probably soon given cases doubling 500 1000ba week last week).
I wish international media would stop nonsense headlines. for? get sick hands. Gloves protect put every time touch something contaminated take afterwards. Duh  Seating chart interesting. one lineage transmission, one transmits alot. 
* nobody sitting next infected got infected, lol Two numerous reasons:

\- UK failed implement effective track trace covid-19 infections early despite recommendations

\- first response go herd immunity letting infection run course

In total UK Covid-19 response colossal failure people paid significant death toll. look Japan, masks extremely common COVID-19 not. Wonder why.

Just stop. You’re smarter scientists actually know they’re talking about. It’s okay though, believe see news.

It's weird make case critical thinking simultaneously making massive assumption.

Anyway, I'm calling bullshit anecdote, specifically say? essential! like OP think PARTLY blame themselves. Lmao, Wave 2? US even seen end first wave. I’ve Covid since last Monday. Got confirmed Friday. People seem talk lot symptoms stuff coming end. Idk true. thought almost done wouldn’t need worry. anyone confirm this? I’m done think don’t worry anymore. There’s reason I’m avoiding Conventions least two years. civilization ending meteor impact hard reset?  CFR IFR. 

The real number cases estimated x10 confirmed number cases, that's IFR 0 0.3 0.6% range. 

If really want head segment population age co-morbidities, IFR 40 years old perfect health astronomically low point they're likely hit lightning. add [birth control trials Puerto 

And also [Dr /spit someone (idiotic) relatives opposed masks seatbelts, might surprised many people don’t see problem tongue cheek statement. facts matter, Billionaire impersonator Donald Trump cronies need avoid Prison time bankruptcy. keep lying herd supporters ""herd mentality"", strong economy get reelected, can't strong economy shutdowns. mind Republicans, willing let millions Americans die get punished. nice? guess people like simply think innovators, scientists, artists serve feeble-minded needs sense responsibility.

You know literally nothing me, somehow convinced buy new phone, TV car every year. fucking joke. I'm willing bet neither innovator, scientist, artist, anything remotely alike. Talk feeble-minded needs. Wow. TIL. great points justifying costs twice much employ NYPD officer LAPD officer. Yes, see actually NEED budget. Thank pulling wool eyes. 

THE TAXPAYERS CHEATED! Cities counties allowed fine you. allowed fine store. store 100% allowed refuse service. shirt, shoes, mask, service. 

Of course, store would care enough consider worth while. 

I don’t know what’s happened grocery stores. city/county still mask mandate, who’s enforcing now? thats nuts Media become untrustworthy institution democracy ... no, try again. someone ate restaurant past weeks doesn’t mean got covid gave someone else. fuck cares subreddit says?

Every public health expert warning winter since started. There's also massive number scientific papers respiratory viruses seasonal. would apply virus. countries randomized populational samples actually know many people already got infected order set proper IFR.

&amp;#x200B;

When something like happens:

&amp;#x200B;

[the infection fatality rate (IFR) period could potentially low seems affect 20-40YO group wors

&amp;#x200B;

[No, 60 least affected, people die already dying, 60 chronical could far worse, super serious.

&amp;#x200B;

[Its agree people overweight suffer prolonged side effects Covid-19 blame? hate mentality. pretty selfish leave community greener pastures possible improve live get involved local politics. Can't turn Florida blue blue voters keep moving away. interesting experiment. think part pandemic flattened curve goes straight up. Wow . ignorance astounding. live first hand repercussions iof nypd budget issues , realities ongoing political issues .. thank permission “get bent” don’t lifetime sequels yet. would even know live several months I’m this. Well, signal could single various smells, lack one smells, combination things. whole point substance make statistical test confirm dog distinguish smell signal. requires little infrastructure replicate. definition community transmission independent proportion infected individuals. every single respiratory virus displays seasonal pattern. would one different?

Because ***this sub*** said so. I’ve actual nurses tell this. couldn’t make money surgeries not. It’s okay though, believe see news. people really believe anything comes china? Remindme! January 1 Hey Gov DeSantis. issue stockpiling, companies streamlined production lack variety. Also strong US dollar stores buying excess Canada Mexico. issue transport well intentionally count everybody dies something died it, everybody getting still dying whatever, gonna put #1 pretty easy B&amp;O tax little sales tax. It’s closer income tax, it’s imposed gross receipts business state Washington considers “nexus” (the rules rises level taxable presence Washington notoriously broad). business *lose* money still subject B&amp;O tax. Needless say, B&amp;O tax quite lucrative, also hated businesses country subject it. Washington’s B&amp;O tax receipts aren’t taking nearly hit states seeing sales tax collection. interesting see happens late October starts getting really cold countries Northern Hemisphere. thought mayor savior? defied trump. nothing hands. Trump's nonstop anti-science actions dire consequences.

This 100% fault. allow, demand. 

If everything opens people refuse return work, denied unemployment benefits. Even they're high risk. 

If there's unemployment even point. That's states need federal funds assist. what's coming? Global hand palming. Watch public health official also getting death threats (Dr. Bonnie Henry British Columbia, Canada). extensive background we've lucky idiots idiots. Masks great alone they're enough stop spread. Get bent...the NYPD DOUBLE budget LAPD allocate per officer. Sounds like $5B goes waste every year. good news-ish takeaway spin eternal optimist:

Nobody symptoms even year yet could clear soon . . . day now

The article mentions possibly-thousands millions cases Truth hurts. insanely dumb reply. 

Of course restaurants cause people get covid. People transmit covid people social situations, restaurants one popular locations. Yeah local health clinic injects distilled water instead vaccine. something misused mean work, work. Beats closed airport millions miles, pun intended. Gigafactory Washoe county. messed need add /s matter bad media misleads they'll never call out. lot thing makes feel good. Like know something special. uncle way. Totally devoted Fox. Anywhere went TV comfortable. Even Christmas talking visiting planted front TV watching Fox talk war Christmas. Ironic. ""If that's truly case?"" would make up? Maybe clear enough: I've tense I've eating much less lack appetite. doctor delighted, diet path would chosen. already exercising, comfortable gradual, safe weight loss resulting that. You’re making shit up. done Florida number new cases deaths dropped considerably. Today marks lowest numbers months. counties mask mandate, almost every business hand sanitizer wipes surfaces people using common sense.

This sub two months ago said would hitting 80k cases day time year. 738 today. sub become 100% doom gloom political.

All need telescopic lens beach, stock bar hopping pics easily get outrage article spammed sub. stop going hospital Florida. wanna co mingle. Go ahead. 

Just don’t put health care workers risk. 

Get sick. stay home. Selfish. gov't sacrificing people theory gov't maybe theory bad. already made bigly trade deal China. found way poop make toilet. planning getting flu shot last Saturday. decided get flu Friday night instead. 😭😩 actually believes US numbers?

Imagine that, can't trust US anymore even basic bookkeeping. sad... Morons think eradicating virus anyway conceivable. fault despicable governing bodies. unfortunately they'll probably ride out. maybe death totals start spiking something fierce, it'll late. edited, hope helps. Sorry, often fumble words days...I elderly showing more@ keep thinking myself, ""There really adults charge, there?"" sorry :( Look graph again. Testing rise. family got it. One died. family still say hoax. specific group American people. old expensive health issues. 200,000 insurance industry's expensive liabilities suddenly taken books. vast windfall Wall Street we're getting started. ""Get fucked Fauci"" -Florida Bad timing winter coming. personally find hilarious.

Stupid fuck, hilarious none less.

I'm disappointed mr. cain enjoy shitposting. co workers keep saying virus disappear election..  lol. happened sweden, say can't happen florida? yoga also nazi invention?

They also say partly responsible body. like Hitler stuff! Ok thanks Larry Kudlow Nice read 1000 IU vitamin per 50 pounds body. Confirms D3 dosage.
Thx 100,000 ppl infected

but 2 tests

you use tests

they pop hot

""oh worries everyone 2 ppl infected cool"" rate

so: instead treating country 50 different government systems 50 different places 50 different places first wave, considering unitary whole saying third wave first still waxing waning various places? Seems pretty lazy. US tried manipulate numbers Feb/March suppress testing, work out? stereotypical, everyone Rural areas goes Walmart Church. might true everyone shack rural Alaska reasonable safe, rural areas plenty people spread Covid everyone. Obama administration excellent kicking road. That’s basically Paris climate accords about. functionally wasted 12 years combat global warming. much hope Biden changing either seeing Obama mostly chose closest thing Republican could pick calm fears racist blue dog democrats. It’s gonna rough decade.  ...and still first ""wave"" projecting *third* seems silly Wait till sees video recent party.... want covid go away takes mask. 1 million dead. Good job donald 7 limit state imposed federal though. doesn’t make sense people go beaches get infected punish hair salons. reactionary tying opening case rate unscientific frustrating. don’t think Florida best thing pretense .1 fewer cases somehow makes haircuts viable shit policy. Don’t hate player here, hate game California one making game’s rules. Conservatives listen either way. That's makes conservatives.  Wrong. It’s actually closer 1.5 million count excess deaths specifically due covid. add suicides, hunger, delayed healthcare, etc.
Very right! ""Small preliminary studies"" ""possible benefits"" still studied well, _well_ usual bar EUA FDA. example, remdesivir pass full Phase 3 get it.

So either pressure Trump, they've significantly lowered standards. bad. kind us vs rhetoric problematic red neck screaming “MUH RIGHTS!!!” 

No, telling people kill problematic people insisting killing themselves.

Pull head ass Based responses ""CDC recommends virtual thanksgiving"" article.. entire fucking country walled mid November. cases declining despite restrictions

I literally pointed cities Florida Arizona restrictions, bars closed months Arizona (recently reopened) say ""They restrictions!"" 

And want invoke Sweden? death rate far higher Scandinavian countries. 

No one knows Tanzania well, although suspicions they're hiding numbers. Either way, nothing point since argument death rate everywhere, restrictions neither help hurt. 

And no, city Florida Arizona match NYC's population density. Miami's population density 13,500 per square mile. NYC 27,000. Cross river Union City, NJ, 54,000. way, Phoenix 3,100.  please, tell they're same. 

And turns out, NYC's death rats 282 per 100,000, Miami's 119. Twice population density, little twice death rate. Funny works. (of course, again, big reason NYC's death rate fact tip spear pandemic US)

How know vast majority public health experts back restrictions masks? they're TV country pleading people listen - please, name city county head health experts saying ""Nothing worry about, we're immune, put away masks pack dance floor!"" headline like ""Bread: food something bake?"" that's truly case, applaud something challenging strenuous times would strongly suggest likely outlier. People tough enough time losing weight good times. doubt mind American (and world) population, already getting fatter alarming rate, getting even fatter faster Agreed. rip bandaid sort thing. We, country, tried play sides. governors went hard, others nothing efforts didn’t matter without federal support. “Find PPE” certainly support looking for. yet, still can’t get federal support time. exact worst time pandemic hit country. incompetent president fighting freedom election year country divided. I’m hoping doesn’t set us back much country. That’s voting works say ""dumb"" headline is, way? Maybe ""sad"" correct. 

I swear half headlines days borderline /r/nottheonion Well, that's what's going happen, one stop apologise, three people thread tell hysterical plandemic created democrats. actually asking question good faith way aggro.  lol positive rate Florida false positive rate test, many states significantly *lower* positive rate Florida? Federal govt sooner denied USD Japan yen.

You want balance budget thinking like currency-user, like household, Federal govt issuer. Whole different game.

Do forget also, surplus us deficit someone else. govt forced run balanced budget, means non govt forced well. means cannot save govt's currency, willing dissave it. thought DeSantis ended restrictions. Lmao. Tell supporters. Understood. US, I’m state (Ohio) generally “done well” thus far. We’ve share cases deaths, kept pretty flat spread never felt like got hit “wave” sort. process, we’ve also run health director potential replacement governor threatened actions taken. guess keep waiting shoe drop. #7 populous state, we’ve hanging 13-15 range cases. winter done won’t bit surprised see us top 10 we, statistically, since can’t point anything currently “doing well.” Didnt say 1 month LOL also nice edit comment hahaha Nevada going huge issue come next budget session. gambling tourism supposed balance budget, also expected finance new 2 billion dollar NFL stadium. Cause ridiculous born country everything already owned tell need go make like hard working rich people everything given parent did.

And besides, person still gets keep 50%. I'm supposed cry Jeff Bezos's kids would get 75 billion? think fine. Actually, original version coronavirus (Type A) widespread US right now. strain widespread Wuhan started Type B (with Type found Americans Wuhan time), B offshoot Type Forster Cambridge believe Wuhan epicenter, given weak Type ""performed"" I'm moving there.

Yeah first opportunity, it. Sorry bruv. maybe think others situations sometimes. 

Aight noted. Maybe prick next time act like child? Declare public health emergency make law banning restaurants selling it. Ban people going restaurant selling illegally. Make crime cite people break laws. Schooling also important social development. 

“Homeschool kid” stereotypes exist reason. Yes, also plenty well-adjusted homeschool kids, that’s parents made sure participated many social activities peers (sports, homeschool social groups, church youth group, part-time clases regular school, etc.). outside social activities curtailed right now, too. consider levels. Finally, type reddit stalking really get behind! also think steak looks delicious. hand, flu season arrives, death rate rises dramatically.  Retirees spend money local Florida restaurants retail businesses? Sounds like want money go locals communities. Yes use failure excuse exponentially greater levels failure. smh posted said 6.5 million state 10 million state till run even that’s probably whole season Trump? Florida politics breeding ground corruption. Florida breeding ground stupidity. People would rather die pay state income taxes. Source: family panhandle. Fuck place. [On bright side, billionaires saw net worth increase nearly Yay capitalism and/or greed! I'm sure 7d ones exist. I've following FT coverage since March stick Johns Hopkins, I've also followed since then, numbers stats consistency think country try fight that's entirely different topic

It's inherently topic. We've spent literally trillions fighting COVID. many trillions go around. even argue enough both, push fight obesity fight COVID?

Lastly, right COVID approaching obesity difference obesity related deaths skyrocketing. US. Europe Latin America too. COVID kill years obesity kill decades kill many, many people younger ages. devastate health care world over. live; n Florida, terrified leave house. 
I work unfortunately one comfort working wore masks dining room closed, look like that's going case. Im immunocompromised medication want go back work. 😢 least advocate masks wanna dipshit I'm suggesting school campuses corona-free, really constitutes disaster you? That's word. One examples disaster story single second-grader contracting coronavirus outside school. 

We know serious consequences covid rare school aged cohort, rare still age range parents would typically in. Grandparents? rare, child lives grandparents, maybe special considerations need made instances. flu, commonly spreads schools without closures major concerns, said greater risk students coronavirus is. 

Maintaining public health important, public education. Data keeps coming around country world, keeping schools closed en masse justified risk virus. Especially damage isolation lack education people. stupid. unnecessary step designed undermine faith FDA. FDA made doctors scientists. vaccine dangerous, going approve even Trump promises nuke don't. 

Trust FDA. trust white house. Know difference. Lol ok dude, everyone 'do it.' sound entitled lol. could well..

Note actual statistics said US recorded almost 55,000 cases nearly **800 deaths** coronavirus.

It seems pretty clear normally smarter this. caused even check saying something inaccurate? heuristic inherent people called ""tribalism"". correction false claim regarding something Trump said could interpreted ""defending Trump"", thus viewed part outgroup ""conservatives"" subconsciously applied associated generalizations (this cognitive bias called [outgroup Anger interferes reason causes us jump conclusions readily.

Tampa. that, shoot anyone approaching borders. ( Recently shot kill S. Korean official, allegedly intended defect N. Korea. ) No, I’ve one every year 25 years never gotten dizzy. known someone has.

If don’t like shots, firmly ignore tech work, chat totally unrelated topic (they’re used people distracting themselves), don’t look needle, list favorite pie flavors whatever head seconds give shot. years usually don’t even feel shot, feels like pinch followed mild swelling sensation.

For me, often get mild soreness arm hours - especially I’m lazy don’t use arm much. don’t baby get shot couch potato day maybe stretches exercises occasionally. One time get mild fever half day - degree normal. That's social safety net supposed used for. govt still paying people stay home. need months straight. bright NV - mean go tRump '16 dumb still...we ranked book learnin like 'Bama, 'Sippi, Lousyana... sure I'm going make past 3 years...

Things can't stay closed forever. people sub give one flying fuck people losing livelihoods spent entire lives building government hangs dry. Game changing. Finally things done.

Ill continue silent majority like many others, continue getting news cherry-picked reddit stories beliving fear mongering going since march. Yeah, going say 2/3 US parents getting kids vaccinated flu, that's actually amazing compared normal year like 30-40%  true point. can’t handle truth. Would rather focus disinformation talking points.

We major surge capacity even NYC let primary spreader (The Subway System) operate unsanatized never used massive temporary hospitals, never used hospital ship, never ran vents (which known increase fatality). 

Further NYC hospitals swamped months infections stopped profitable number simply closed shifting burden nearby hospitals. 

Finally drugs recommended prescribed specifically HCQ previously politicized single bad study hyped media discredit it. effective massively reducing death hospitalization administered early. 

This without even making “the death rate .5% fuck quit killing economy 60% small businesses”. 


If you’re truly vulnerable scared stay home yourself. rest us gave six months lives savings try help legitimate concern. 17k deaths Florida date, wonder split looks like along political lines. would truly sad Florida swung blue many Trump voters died COVID. see tons people posting 2022+.

Fauci guy really needs anger translator AKA Lower Alabama... would 15 days done right. Instead, Ron DeSantis refused take decisive action, causing horrible drawn-out misery Floridians. Also, didn’t need full lockdown us better shape now. statewide mask mandate would slowed spread without hurting businesses process.

The evidence pretty strong public health measures fewer cases fewer deaths, I’m sure you’re trying go “possibly” angle. Oh dont worry. politicians see problem solved. moving 😳  full lock right now, economy weak people cannot afford going work. 

We wasted 3 months quarentine much infections, infections care anymore. keep shelter place guidelines 2030 safe. people lose house need make sure tents spread also. Thank you. good thing shoppers pretty much workers still masked. don’t know long last signs down. PRC know doing, interesting.

The last sentence heard also F ITA. Czech icu beds 11.6 per 100k exactly F. Montana 1 million total population. Dunno others. \*GASP\*

You mean sub sensationalize data context?!

No. no, no. must wrong. Double check facts. think anyone ever said we'd locked 2022. even think pandemic last long don’t know waves proper model anymore, it’s flood. One said someone come multiple gun shot wounds. guy ended dying. told mark Covid death. know nurse personally. I’m sure everything could keep hush makes hospitals/government look corrupt dishonest. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Washed hands first! oh that's scary one indeed jesus impoverished laborers know want make money. concerned paying life .03% chance die coronavirus. No... defending anyone. whataboutism about. 

Relevant username way. really wanker. worry florida spread back rest US. No, worst case scenario 3k people passing away per day around January. family member symptoms exposure told stay home assume it, don’t bother test. county health department says don’t resources tracing follow steps website. 

One person know thought symptoms went community event, went test. positive. 

We screwed opened back June volunteer. Better worse gov California? clinical trials dangerously conservative? Australia, seen cases recovered covid19 still lingering health issues. can't simply let guard pretend medicine enough let go away. stupid purposely infect healthy people test something. sorry. :(

I really feel people work situations. find utterly reprehensible least keep small protective measures place fully opening. workplace aces requiring masks distancing, I'm Maryland Florida. wish could export common sense practices y'all. 

Stay safe! concerning they're opening. concerning people carefree see pandemic inconvenience oppression. hate here. That's really interesting read. Thanks! spelled “weld people homes” wrong. pause rent, mortgage, etc 2 mths, give people money food stuff, ask people stay home weeks? 

That happen back like April May already expired many places, soon otherwise. people stay home ""tHE guBMinT StEAlin frEEDomS!"" mentality. There's way current political landscape functional enough get heads asses actually get stimulus place effectively help people, they're bunch toddlers bitching back forth desires much notice Johnny Public fell fucking sewer drain dying. Announce plenty warning people buy stuff. Limit amounts things person buy per day, hoarding. 

See point above. mass testing area area, restricting travel untested tested safe areas, sending infected people quarantine? 

More I'm afraid, compounded central, organized, cohesive response... level. Cities make plans, kinda follow state governor mandate, and... Well can't even get president trust experts field. 

Ah, part fires anyone suggests something like / agree with. That's thing, resonates supporters Fauci protective agents entire family now. fucking insane. Boom, weed sick ones, healthy people get reinfected, sick people get treatment gets severe?

The logic sound it? bad far many people think logically Give docs treating infected really good PPE stay healthy. 

Lots points here. Firstly, again, trump favored people hoarded bunch PPE nationally stockpiled states use, caused absurd price gouging lack supply... lead wonderful capitalist, free market healthcare overlords restrict ones hand, causing healthcare workers reuse equipment days weeks. Perks lean, time free market economy.

So yeah, that's little bit going states.... I'm told everyone jealous freedom people ever onboard following strict shelter place guidelines 2022. People made choice. What’s happening Colorado? Many people Reddit saying would tough shelter place laws 2022+ bad. Said people would get COVID fatigue done end 2020 vaccine not. Feeling better prediction. Good plan. problem this, German police learn internet exists sooner 2035... :( reproductive rate higher, mean infection rate lot higher reported mortality rate lot lower? LA Mayor idiot anyone downvoting this, refer thread can’t access article Europe, wonder... claims “civil right” shop private business “serves public...”

What odds lady also sort supports private businesses refuse provide services gay people “religious beliefs,” etc... wisest comment here. 

For want understand why, actual customers ad-funded journalism advertisers, viewers, care getting people listen.

Unfortunately best way appealing fear outrage. fundamental liability human mind perception threat seizes attention makes everything else feel less important. nothing intelligence, nobody immune. Journalists even choice, responsible journalism cannot compete sensationalism ability grab people's stories type reporting best work end unrepresentative actually important actually better listening news all. cause people become *disconnected* reality harming mental I’m 6 months hope that’s case want recover badly saying it’s Dysautonomia, scary condition Yeah Czechs great job beginning. problem leadership dropped ball people got careless. Oh ): according research done ICMR said back may every 1 case 81-130 cases gone undetected. back may india around 130,000 estimated almost 6.5 million people already infected. numbers might really huge. tried android, works (zoom activating, shows nation wide scale) Already social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands, see point flu shot. point India improving really isn't. bumps statistics way cases reported, however biggest trend numbers doubled month 6 million. extremely worrying.  Ohh nooooooo!!!  love web. Get IPs provider data. Sue fine them. Hoo boy. start. 

They tried. many issues, TL;DR nutshell, are, basically:

A 2 month eviction moratorium enacted, extended, believe due expire end September. Either way, landlords incentivized continue delaying rent (I think get tax write-off rental property empty).

The federal government told states pandemic response them. states implemented different responses. checkpoints states people locked one state drive another may partially open. NY states tried force people coming high risk areas quarantine that's nearly impossible enforce. 

There acute shortage PPE medical professionals. Factories co-opted federal government switch production badly needed supplies used (would take invocation Defense Production Act president).

We enough tests accurately track, labs overwhelmed test results delayed week even two...rendering useless point (especially people can't take sick leave work without positive test).

Then people refuse science whatever reasons - political mostly. making easy, lot conflicting misleading information coming sides. People resistant things like contract tracing privacy concerns. much American (US) society places individualism higher collectivism, LOT people basically want caring others. also, apparently help government provides ""socialism"" dirty word lot people.

I'm sure there's tons examples, late I'm going bed. :) I'm Hong Kong. [3rd best place business Despite protests etc. 

I understand capitalism. 

But also understand sick dying people mean lower labor lower consumer spending short, medium long term.

Having white collar transition office work work home also kills lot businesses survive business commuter related expenditure, Brooks Brothers, Starbucks, airlines etc. becomes long term trend, lose segment economy completely. 

People going less means lower consumption. 

What happens becomes long term trend? Covid stay? Vaccines working long term example, mutated strains coming faster test vaccines? 

What happens air travel, tourism, f&amp;b, fashion industries? cost year people without insurance. Many unemployed people health insurance 40 bucks sadly! Youuuu probably done that. Diphtheria one I've heard of. Time quick search.

Well explains heard it. medically advanced societies eradicated vaccines treatment. Neat though, new trivia said going strike laws policies bypass safety measures? Actually *after* election disappear. elaborate conspiracy involving half Americans, along countries world, leaders citizens. attempt make Trump look bad economy tank, causing lose election. add onto it, general biology mutation likely break something make better surviving. Now, virus could lowering transmission rates straight becoming lethal, terms slowing infection rates. However, less likely latter, likely mutate ways prevent either spreading efficiently becoming weaker whole.


And course that's assuming mutate meaningful degree anyway really nice. Around 50k new cases day yesterday sept 27... think 3k going hospitals? Isnt optimistic? Yes crisis shown need prosecute cowards use anonymity web things. assertion:

Like nothing going happen.. haven’t flu shot 12 years. honest kind it/didn’t see purpose since never gotten flu. would get covid vaccine heartbeat makes wonder wouldn’t get flu shot too? here’s getting done. No, colleges weren’t open summer. neighbor loud party every Saturday night though. Wouldn’t want chart 5 day average Monday thru Friday then? link, seen research suggesting 75% infections occur 2 days symptoms onset.

You’d fighting battles get people “comply” came it.  shoot all? Im surprised cops told lock doors light place fire! month first time 300,000 infections multiple days conspiracy theories stop. actual numbers coming hospitals sitting denying like Republicans deny climate change science. 

Some people can’t grasp concept don’t know lot virus receiving new information day. isn’t spreading schools? wasn’t post-labor day spike post-memorial day? don’t know doesn’t mean data statistics wrong, means haven’t figured yet. 

It’s asinine believe solutions developed March fight virus knew nothing wouldn’t change new information became available. good god, 
are freaking serious this? According step-mother, isn’t, media tells us is. tried explain thing called internet exists access media countries even talk individuals countries, didn’t seem make difference. thought air conditioning people got lot ventilation summer months. long agree Florida, fully open back up. (like OP suggests) still counties share vulnerabilities, infection rates. Makes sense paint brush. physical solution de-populate city centers. It’s like Vietnam war. got expensive maintain pretended won. agree. 9 10 sounds like total bullshit - maybe flip 1 10 might believed step-mom said would go away election. response : “yes, whole world willingly shut countries destroyed economies spite Trump.” can't imagine gore-verse would look like. Oh, can, much better one. instance, seventeen countries 10,000 officially confirmed deaths, data excess deaths available three (India, Iran, Argentina); fourteen countries, three (France, Chile Colombia) excess deaths official covid deaths. (In Chile excess deaths covid deaths match almost perfectly, France Colombia slightly official covid deaths excess deaths). greatest underestimates (percentage wise) Peru, Ecuador, Russia, South Africa (all twice many excess deaths official covid deaths), Indonesia (at least three times many, possibly even more). know knew bad February blatantly lied us know care? curious you’re avoiding it.  least Stonks go up! CDC director Dr. Anthony Fauci said expect vaccine ready end 2020, begin distributed high-risk groups early 2021, wider population 3rd quarter 2021. someone please help us regulate Govenor De Santis, he’s trying kill us. enticed club rats Covid19 over. anything anyone do?

Literally told demographic ok go back bars worry restrict local government hold accountable impose restrictions.

He caught every mayor state official guard. Political stunt! 

Wtf going talking app shows green, yellow red whether enter place. I’m sure you’re familiar it. Oceania\* that’s worried about? according science mr. sagan kids successs mostly due luck social status born to, relax kids exactly meant regardless year learning remote Please...can stop bullshit Oh noooo people covid. lets see many 40k recover never end hospital. Bar closed 6 weeks March-May lockdown re-opened. matter reddit says situation Paris bad yet. 

Lockdown march came (at time mask, social distance, went event one week lockdown laughing volunteer forced wear mask) issue ICU bed available, remember military medical corp deploying field hospital medicalized train moving patient across country ? bad lockdown order came. 

Situation great number diagnosed patient rise (which expected), number people ICU rise. However, moment situation bad point close everything, government (national municipal) slowly tighten screw find right balance stopping fully country letting virus flow freely. Something 80% country wokrs normally number patient ICU stays constant slowly reduce would ideal. fauci telling truth hard enough. mean sensible people is, people peddling anti truth REEEEEAAAAAALLLLLLL HARD. sensible blatant ignorance enough. Alright convinced me, let's agree agree. Unite r/coronavirus! false, course.

In countries enacted lockdowns virus spread - even regions countries enacted lockdowns virus spread, southern Italy - overall mortality went *below* normal. indirect excess mortality countries regions heavily hit covid, people unable receive treatment hospitals already full covid patients. 

And that's without accounting fact countries hit early spring, UK (since cited daily mail), thousands people died covid without ever tested thus without included covid death toll. course covid deniers ignore evident fact assume someone certified covid victim, he/she died covid. 

Lockdowns kill anyone, contrary, reduced all-cause mortality. anti-lockdown activists must find way twist numbers, seven months straight. completely, hopelessly disconnected reality. go again... Lockdown eradicating anything, slowing buying us time. Covid forever forever *in current state*. Chances it'll like previous pandemics gets weaker probably (hopefully) worse regular flu help vaccines treatments. ridiculous comment. Tests widely available and, yes, government releasing confirmed cases.

The conspiracy theories getting hand. reality Wuhan's lock strict among regions world, anything Chinese reason show better result.

But still followed exponential decay matter harsh was. didn't. Even crazy rumours true literally welded people apartments still resulted faster decline, unnaturally discontinuous decline. shape decline telling something right. seems pretty useless, nearly symptoms possible 3. Man thought agreeing backpedaling.

A car wheels virus wheels. I, hand, faith failing businesses 

I call failing businesses, insinuates owners fault. Businesses distress probably appropriate. fault entirely structured business around social gatherings pandemic dangerous happened. People simplifying way much. spread infectious diseases general virus particular poorly understood, way many people think. 

Having high mask usage isn’t it. rules social distancing isn’t it. Contact tracing isn’t it. International travel isn’t it. It’s combination above, probably ton factors, known yet unknown. 

Scientists working full time idea explain differences infections deaths across world, yet many people Reddit seem think answer saying ”people wear masks, it’s simple”. Enjoy getting COVID guess. get immigrant visa move Canada need certain number “points” immigrant system. get points for: fluent French, immediate family members already live Canada, advanced training, work essential field Canada unable fill domestic workers, job contract Canadian employer sponsored &amp; written letter you, young (you get points subtracted every year age). typically need least 3 things - one isn’t enough. testing numbers 10k week now. shifted asymptomatic testing pharmacies. resurg centre’s getting swamped. Saying longer testing inaccurate. Zymotic diseases.

Asking 1000 people question tell true answer billion. Yes, statics lie. educate surviving COVID like. like magically better, unless mild case traumatic affair long term complications. ""you live die."" Florida knows new stimulus reached Congress, perhaps want bigger cut said deal purposely that... way across country! would like survive. dont need survive.  purposeful culling. seem like it. reason Nancy pelosi get haircut without mask, rules thee me. Anyone basic health care background goes see ordinary sample people wear masks attest that.

Every fucking plane ride I've everyone around fidget masks, they're uncomfortable. Like orgy face touching. agree is. exact measures place multiple countries there's difference infection rates.

Every country morons sociopaths. can't say I've seen anyone kiss shake hands meet Spain since whole thing started think difference much done much done France Italy. 

I think difference due top-down policies implemented inforced. think significant difference % people complied them. People people, they're dumber smarter, less civic one country another. Nocebo effect 9 10? seriously dont get ... whole thing started put everything lockdown keep everyone safe risk time high lot people taking precautions ""stupid anti mask cult "" want reopen country? dont get way anyone explain ok , people dying lot friends deaths families thanks whole shit show..

The explanation accept rich people control country want start lost lot money want get economy back fill pockets. Source? risk long haul Covid far problematic chance death 

Lots coronavirus patients sick 6 months hell beatdown really, really glad government Austria legally restrict private gatherings, parties, meetings et cetera. concept informed consent really came second half 20th century. People (especially women) races backgrounds treated appallingly medical science.

The idea due history somehow rational refuse vaccine offered everyone 2020 frankly stupid. I'm sorry, indulging treating way treat fears anti-vaxxers. Arizona smaller tribal hospitals overflowed moved Flagstaff Phoenix depending serious availability. also started transporting NM. Genetic living conditions seems really hit tribes worst. mean, suppose seem way. 

It's evolution, people also seem realize many people African descent themselves. studies believe originally migrated Africa time lighter skin (less melanin) ones able survive, sun's become less get equator. them, reaching enough North, bred neanderthals. people also neanderthal dna. 

This recall read looked much years, hey! wiki page :) 

But yes, genetically different ways others, important process goes world without excluding anyone. Especially black people, since make huge portion world, whether people like not. impossible say genetics contributing, especially skin colour, that's makes people colour are. makes us are, many, many, many people make become us. Genetics fun, I'd like say nothing wrong conversation genetics anyone, tried correct someone happened firehouse 20 racist discussion ""gene-splice"" fact fiction. someone wanting discuss genetics good fun yay, ""GeNeTiCs"" used for, racist idealogy, sexism, homophobia, speciesism, etc. understand could see comment racist enjoy reading science history whatnot. opinions subject change, that's coming since I'm doctor scientist, genetics widely accepted real.... time being.... Haha :) Need porn meme going get screwed hard Yeah, pretty sure okay covid. commented 100% INCORRECT.

You fully guaranteed right vote. Request absentee ballot.

Problem solved.

The military problems make shit. Tbh im suprised India isnt higher considering country population 3 good bit more. you’re pissing people Linköping Norrköping. call “den fjärde storstadsregionen”. collectively much wealth hoarded that, redistributed hoards tiny handful billionaires, could get 10% capacity (i.e. absolute essential workers) months, would long enough reduce virus level manageable contact tracing. 

And shelter temporarily free we'd put freeze mortgage rent payments awhile. 

It's resources problem. distribution inequity problem. think outcome mostly depend move people stadium. 500 seated people crowded arenas, entry/exit points another matter. really, really glad government Austria legally restrict privat gatherings, parties, meetings et cetera. Even using bathroom? control (natural infection spreading measures control it) would exponential. linear indeed good. no, haven’t. thanks admitting trolling though! Only? also likely home, no? least actively avoiding people possible (hopefully) wearing mask KNOW sick, right? I've detached since society told existence sin illegal. really nice detached! Good luck! $200 fine wearing mask, $5k breaking restrictions (like 5km rule social gathering home).

Retail still shut, hairdressers (my hair looks terrible 😭), restaurants cafes takeaway only. 

Our recent concession 5 people meet outside (but they're max two households). Still gatherings allowed indoors. I've working home since March absolute earliest estimate weve given START transitioning back office January.

But yes agree people seem agree best. Bigger source discussion team agonising whether time try at-home haircut... restrictions? can't imagine isolation child. easy fully functioning adult. car. still escape go hiking whenever. still go work. Adults still complete agency know, activities gone repair, chores, landscaping, gardening, etc. pretty much already figured world, place it, routine. 

But holy shit. child, school escape tyranny household. balls energy. learn perspective, develope, build relationships, figuring shit out. 

I can't imagine parents told can't goto school, sounds excited first, week I'd fall depression, immediately transition online cut activities. can't see friends, might kill somebody. Wut. 

I mean, generations crises, still healthy coping mechanisms deal it. Young kids generation got prison sentence unknown length time. Cause States broke cannot operate deficit many cases. Florida income tax NEEDS dining tourism remain solvent...Federal funding isnt happening, bad top stupid right vote 100% guaranteed service member.

Absentee ballot.

Source: service member served outside home state country. mean downbeat find bit good true. 94-95% accuracy rt-pcr around 66% seems bit odd eyes. 

Also dogs already amazing without added feature seems overkill goodness single animal

I'm skeptical see something bit close actual scientific testproofing, especially cases controls people infected respiratory diseases seems hard well. hey, dogs also detect respiratory diseases would necessarily bad thing anyway lucky watch ""till then"". Working class people, young people, people developing world luxury.

It must nice though detached. genuinely envious. refs change November 4th. literally getting numbers straight hospital. Ofc real power lol. atleast make one swede upset situation ive done something. federal response Hurricane Katrina long ago. Chaos election. like woman got fired state refused underreport numbers could justify reopening things time July 4th. happened couple months later? state department health declares ""Oops! found thousands unreported cases end June. couple months ago, we're good now"" Either way, parental guidance inclusion important biggest factor success. Many homeschooled children outperform children taught public schools. There’s factors success “Did child attend school classroom?” Exactly like they’ve open every cold flu season history White House still controlling COVID data? 45000 cases 4 days? US currently daily confirmed cases 35-40K per day since Friday report reporting sum it. 

Just get correct idea dire things getting. half clearly see incompetent many worlds leaders actually are. isnt even anti vaxxer stuff though. *testing* vaccine. 12 new cases today Australia. Great, it’s peer reviewed it’s useless. could burn building call ""peaceful protest"" would also good! likely cough sneeze cold flu Covid (asymptomatic). must Clint Eastwood fan. Oh wow commenting Reddit, hero! 🥇 look armchair infectious disease experts thread see pretending over. ain’t probably next months going show us worst it. Thank you. think new modelling Ontario (at least) says healthcare system overrun scenarios, suppose never really know. Sorry, disagree. Anti-vaxxer idiocy still anti-vaxxer idiocy matter want dress up. kinds horrible things happened historically absolutely bearing happening today. don’t understand don’t listen Dr. Fauci. President clearly idea talking fixated stock market ranking selfish pig-headed reasons. Scott Atlas point providing much misinformation public boggles mind don’t strip medical license.

And Dr. Fauci... lovely, hard-working professional knows shit doesn’t sugar coat news. wants keep everyone safe. cut public appearances task force pretend like doesn’t exist??? 

Man, I’d love Fauci Canada. would make great addition team. (except anti-mask crazies) love here. change society feasible likely current circumstances?

A change society feasible likely circumstances like currently have.

Honestly, seems like doomed either way. Either economy apparently can't change destroys you, virus does, oh well maybe next society flourish land better job. I'll watch till then. It’s definitely worrying, exactly government warned about. hope manage nip bud, flu season hits. trilogy no-one wanted... He's getting downvoted because, true, really apply thousands others overweight still suffer Covid-19 I'm sorry go bullshit. That's absolutely ridiculous. wish best luck. mean 1500 cases 4 days. That’s 11500 day America. less third high America. here. Obviously many people suffering lingering symptoms health issues, 30+ people know (including family) fully recovered. occasional dry cough digestive inconsistencies lasted additional weeks, nothing concerning long lasting. hope long haulers get answers soon. :( Assuming we’ll hearing Elmhurst cluster soon.

The entire medical community vets FDA. one paying attention?

You hear loud clear data doesn’t hold up. US reported 114 000 new cases since Friday. yeah, it’s good trend even half US doing. disagree. Humans pretty good organizing ourselves. Governments public health officials human well. right education, think could fine without government intervention. Afterall, Sweden pulled way - cant we? [found getting weaker doesn’t happen time, happens continued infections lead eventual mutations. 

It likely already done hasn’t, average age death equivalent average age death IFR 10x+ lower initial estimates good reason moved life many months ago. make sense something? infection concentrated two largest cities? question whether mostly concentrated stockholm. know swedish people live, thanks. happen know lot better c: think large part population idea calculate %. think 0.7% little, probably people.

The newspapers calculate them. mostly want Swedish goverment Swedish population finally get skulls shit aint working.

Sweden harming lot rest world aswell. People arent upset without reason. there's lot money line first place* corners get cut dangers buried. 

Keep full faith capitalism, greed never let us down. Florida open closed Ann Heche’s closet.

At point DeSantis wants kill people. People still listen fauci? Layers part Google maps years

OP asked specifically 'PC/web version' .. Layers exists mobile app. vicious cycle. history trials harmful black people makes black people volunteer less trials, means medications get made work best white people, makes black people distrust medicine less effective actively harmful. 

Black women get doubly hit: [A recent also demonstrated women improperly dosed common meds, likely due underenrollment women drug trials (the [FDA also put similar info back concern since late 60s (since least thalidomide crisis). NIH requires clinical trials explain recruit minorities women people age groups explain appropriate (like recruit women prostate med trial, instance). said something like 60k US 55k, mental. ...oh.
I never even...??
...who would even think mean thing? then, troops need morale boost.

I'm probably going regret this, really comparing sitting home eating delivery Chinese food soldier? fucked

And we'll never know extent new wave published numbers shite. They'll maintain descending curve costs. honest it’s really creepy hang around every post sweden seemingly lust collective demise. i’m going bother correcting blatant misinformation people already simply choose listen, wanted throw there. Amen! 

From beginning, given wide range endposts disruption lives, ranging widely, ""just two weeks stop spread"" ""social distancing 18 months"". 

The pessimistic predictions revolved around projected long timeline development vaccine COVID-19 virus. around March, disruption started people (i.e. lockdowns started, etc.), I'll wager many people (I among them) looking news, trying find (even subconsciously) could ""go back normal"". 

I'd like point out, though, since many authorities there, journalists WHO, apocalyptically prophesying impossible return old normal, should. know *you* think predictions, opinion, counterproductive. think many people, *returning old normal sort ""reward"" long term listening restrictions first*. tell people going get normal lives back end matter *how* much obey, they'll lose obey, put blinders, start ignoring *everything* authorities say pandemic, matter worth anything. matter fact, think that's partly blame Americans' ""giving up"" pandemic.

But case, right people getting impatient. government put restrictions wants, public health experts spit much discouragement possible, *people going put forever*. Heart damage 

40percent show tomosin enzymes cardiac injury Stockholm Gothenburg. Aka 2 3 areas people actually live. Wow. really didn’t think would unpopular opinion. said lengthy somewhat civilized exchange iScreme, don’t countering research. nothing anecdotal data experience go by

By way, research paper isn’t “facts”. probably know that, using shorthand, you’re vastly misstating weight single survey conducted one country internet

I change opinion research comes supporting conclusion, helps soothe worried brow someone internet jumped hastily conclusion I’ve heard people argue rest world pretty much Covid US exacerbates it’s infection death numbers make Trump look bad. people dense numbskulls. Surprisingly enough, slums Mumbai developed herd immunity within slums. case slums cities/towns. Same, I'm us states allowed run budgets deficits needed? care? care people diffetent country believe something different you?

The science still air make strong argument either way moment. know anything concrete scientists done thorough analysis mass data sets.

Posting Reddit gonna change FHM's mind waste time? Yeah another thing helped Italy Germany straightforward decision. take decisions take responsibility. France month arguing take decisions Macron disappeared since weeks letting others put face. Restaurants bars won’t fully recover business long time al least half customers don’t believe hoax won’t go back safe. Watergate? lot people can’t afford take work cold. keep getting invited bars! Stop it!!! lot people can’t afford take work cold. Bernie arguing decades

Rampant, unchecked capitalism + next social security (not Social Security, joke bureaucracy) + deadly, super spreader virus (+ bunch morons top bottom) = businesses survive feed families 

It's clusterfuck situations proves, yet again, US' system stones throw away failed system experts. credentials hire. hang every word people without engaging brain, may deserve falling hole lead to. Um, viruses mutate. time. That's do. COVID mutated multiple times already... virus.

This Hollywood, mutation singular event causes mass chaos, completely normal understood part virus. happen occasionally. worry, dig rusty hook. there's excuse every type person. outright hoax, real worse flu, worse flu affects elderly already sick, affects everyone I'll take chances... mistake think lower (and falling) death rate something that's insignificant. Yes, U.S. higher infection rate. That's proven. However, better worse, U.S. done better job treating infected many countries, including U.K. Canada. Identifying reasons falling death rate extremely important. could lead even greater fall death rate. ultimate goal course, vaccine. Short that, keeping death rate low possible important prevention. principle applies HIV. Yes, prevention best defense. However, someone infected HIV 2020 far greater chance survival someone infected 1980. bright side, maybe they'll learn actual problem still November.

Oh kidding. reason rarely get cold flu summer time. usually get sick fall winter?

Since I'm lazy see u/MrSelfDestruct32's reason put things perspective. 

Germany something like 1000-2000 new cases day, considering limiting parties. 

Florida, 3rd populous American state population 4 times smaller Germany (20 million vs 80 million), also something around 1000-2000 new cases covid day. Florida lifting covid restrictions. 

Are German's overreacting? *still* taking covid seriously enough? would say pharmaceutical industry also less influence. sure? It’s one 977 people much compensation China going paying? Dresden, Germany, allowed 10,000 spectators arena built approx. 30,000 couple weeks ago, think Sweden going survive 500 spectators \^\^ That's policy too. I'm arguing Italy better job. Spain goverment opposition parties urged people go restaurants, use masks they're outdoors, go vacation, etc... lockdown ended, people that.

My point people morons higher degree places. shitty policies. could banned eating indoors example enforced huge sanctions restaurants comply. Instead weak policies barely enforcement. Nobody cares less people falling fear mongering saw interview doctor says struggling covid lingering symptoms since March. True, iraq war led death 300.000-500.000 civilians, weapons mass destruction found. Back seeing people eager boycott American products, inconvenient us. Everyone that?  Source? 

Because comments you’re relying directly contradict bullshit claim you’re making. trade off, honest. control situation better able tailor environment specific needs one two children, opposed school setting impossible needs everyone once. immersive home well, set child's entire area reduce particular triggers. flip side, lose specialized equipment schools help special needs calm focus, lose assistance another staff member remove one overstimulated raging child another area others continue education. 

I 6 home virtual, 5 special needs (autism, DMDD, PTSD, general emotional delay handful significant physical needs, reason virtual begin with). get wrong, would LOVE back school (occupational therapy Zoom nightmare), even things lose school setting, gain things, say constant balancing act would lie, every time situation needs serious intervention, kids lose little bit time, part really sucks. logic check out. think lied masks work must convinced masks work. [Quarantine means party Lol, Merkel calling ""the opposition"" far-right nazis, AfD. are.

Merkel would hard pressed started calling opposition parties like Die Grünen (Green), Die Linken (Left) FDP nazis.

Also, voted Green (or Pirate Party) every election envision hope change government next election. Also moral boost seeing another human suffer terrible can’t compare putting plastic dick minutes (or seconds) drastically altering entire social life. Definitely mutated continue so. Lol. Tampa Bay Lightning Stanley Cup. Throw fucking parade they’re it. Oh yeah Tampa Bay Rays good shot World Series...this gonna get fucked quickly. Brace yourselves. Vaccine also magical cure. 50-70% effective, last long time, etc... another tool box. virus live duration society. Yearly flu shot include vaccine hopefully people exposed sickness significant now.  things considered, that’s staggering victory. developed chronic fatigue mild case mono 16. past year, finally found relief got energy back. covid hit, I’m worried would happen caught it. friends don’t understand concern I’m young healthy, stay house next year that’s takes guarantee safety. Gov. trump's buddy, he's trying get hole he's dug himself. Exactly !! Australia western democracy last time checked. think justified, government also blame quarantine failure. Anyway time argue random person internet, believe want believe want. Smh. Reagan erode trust government ? least physical cycles trying get everyone used several years ongoing problems since start. telling - best case tested vaccine, around 18 months, production distribution enough quantity allow normality, based work biotech company using 12 months. always said family friends dont expect things go back normal 2022, might get lucky mid 2021 worse case never develop workable safe vaccine (although looking less likely now). still Cuomo's Thursday night primetime CNN etched brain shitty sensationalizing it. Apologized air 24 hours later overreacting. 

So comment definitely inaccurate. [Required Minimum Walmart pharmacies way schedule flu shot online fill paperwork ahead time. Much quicker process. Don’t care says, young healthy largely unaffected basically equivalent people wear mask chin/nose expect way still effective. Modi spins well cricketer PM. Fun fact, imagine generally stupid average (insert country denizen here) is. realise half country even stupider that. US Florida Earth. Worldwide Americans Florida Man. 1% figure takes account fact cases going undetected. count confirmed cases mortality rate like 3-4%. Wow hot take! someone moving Florida tomorrow, wow. wow. store for? that, bike week Myrtle Beach weekend, I'm right smack dab middle both. think quarantined next 3 months!! wrong those? use one feels good. missing something? OP linked wrong depends. example, keeping curve flat enough overrun hospitals? wearing mask really COVID eugenics

Change mind Lol, German here, favor change government. like Merkel charge, give her: done one hell job almost opposite authoritarian. Nailed it! envious Canada. Good know guys sensible leaders, wish could say here. Longlasting effect point time fully known understood yet. would slow announce fully recovered. would years come undergo tests complete verify recovery. Uncalled thread. even comment? LMAO facepalm article mention whether participant age factored in, mention patients pre-COVID-19 serum gonadal hormones test (n: 24), serum total testosterone level significantly decreased pre-COVID-19 level 458?±?198?ng/dl 315?±?120?ng/dl time COVID-19 patients (p?=?0.003). friend Florida expecting numbers go got hotter summer. told “You know we’ve virus months Middle East whole bunch countries way hotter Florida summer. haven’t paying attention rest world much, you?” using masks gets money? know that. Europe: ""Why 2nd wave""

Also Europe: ""All pubs bars remain open, shut 10PM"" ""Full super bowl"" - yeah florida fucked  Yes, Called flublok. Although unless egg allergy consists serious reaction, people completely fine get normal flu vaccine too, recommended wait around 15 minutes case something happens. Plenty things can’t done remotely, collaboratively making music one them.  Remindme! 90 days Washington State doesn’t state income tax. We’re near shit show Florida is. doubt we’re getting federal aid Fed gov.  one sentence relates title article, that's sub-heading: *Children represent 10% cumulative reported COVID-19 cases U.S.*

The rest article video recap Covid-19 case anyone time traveled past woke hibernating. sounds like end bad joke. bad it’s real... Take measure solace least inherit genes. makes sense fucking idea regulations works lol I'd surely get walking Target CVS risk catch virus going around. Either dead, can't anything nonessential survival I’m buying excess death theory. 

you're obviously bright, probably enough $ buy much anything. swill pumped Canteloupe Caligula never way. could stimulus check every week people. Republicans bailed airlines, said ' fuck got mine', left everyone else die. maybe us families need $ Europe emerging, still bad Brazil, India US. 4% from? I’ve looking number. Please repost information. people know. circle isn’t changing anything. still stuff delivered, dining out, stores,
Or large gatherings. Phase 3 means nothing me. don’t care reopening much mask ordinance. wear masks religiously. 3 friends get Rona husbands entire medical office. friends mom died, another friend’s uncle. aunt uncle currently it. spreads easily. office got pulled masks clients one worked every morning without mask gym. singlehandedly infected 6 people know about. Luckily family wasn’t infected easily could been. Every reputable serological study around world put death rate somewhere 0.5-1.5% that’s counting official death toll, unspecified “pneumonia“ deaths. Yeah, saw one article described heart DNA getting cut little bits. 

Time show true long term effects. Orinda fine everyone sub admit open rest country? somewhere middle? know. also know get trouble wearing mask properly That’s hope vaccine Fauci approves coming blazing fast works well. stellar treatments like equivalent Tamiflu that’s flu glue hold everything together. It’s insane much flu shot treatment held us long corona. stuff many deadly diseases could treated easily. I’m thinking Covid join list waiting treated people diagnosis early.

True, first years rocky vaccine possible treatments distributed whole nation world, time assume vaccine treatments get better better, getting us back time worried catching flu. I’m sure shit ton cases shortly first announcement vaccine ready quick drop guard (mask), beginning much needed healing probably start there, provided new virus comes 2020 likes 2020. seen recent numbers? too. We’re side. good! I’d say it’s both. doubt it, come lies support claims. Yep. Even including takeout, I've probably ordered 5% amount food restaurants pre-pandemic. Even everyone like me, enough are, restaurants everywhere hurting regardless open are.

You need control spread virus economy come back, idiots. care election. 7% India. Far, _far_ higher major cities concentrated, serosurveys shown. going headache keep overwhelming areas...if even possible right now, us completely opening become nearly impossible stay locked anymore. things like stadiums, nightclubs, huge gatherings etc banned now. Even theaters starting open places, reduced numbers. Maybe someone send military get US. wimps need masks. /s Yes kind growing problem people living long beyond retirement,

^ COVID eugenics. disgusting. point arguing brainlet. depends size sample. sample 29,082 much larger polls. mean covid breathers? made halfway comment realized joking. think that's worst part. Mouth Breathers? I'll get flu shot $100. Shoot bitcoin I'll get one almost like SC justice said would strike pre-existing protections religious issues birth control matter. That's funny say lot liberals point Germany gold standard deal pandemic. Conservatives, right course point Sweden 😑 yeah, private parties huge problem United States comes transmission. That's basically sole cause massive outbreaks universities around country. I'd rather take chances flu Oh hell that's get. see obviously stupid fake information is... can't they? Washington state doesn’t tourism recreation based economy. read article prior sharing look like idiot. :) surely benefit straight rinsing though someone spent days days sewing face masks first responders beginning pandemic, told repeatedly stupid going make pandemic worse suggesting people use cloth masks. 

So say that, reality people rejected them. people later turned around mask supporters seemingly forgot called stupid sewing masks months prior.

I donated 200 masks spent 10+ hours day sewing called idiot. I’ll never forget it. TF? much. Initial estimates mostly range 1-2%. Current estimates 0.5-1.5%. I've basically lived covid style isolation almost 2 years taking care Mom intensive. able game night go movies month(literally time one bother me) really making burnout fast. Giving China props early
Lockdown included welding people homes...

Would successful taming virus hadn’t taken measures? Saving later use Trumpies  parroted months ""the virus disappear Nov 3rd/4th"". actually become mainstream view people asked mom keeps said fogs glasses. knows she’s supposed wear way... know someone sits buckled seat belt. Unsurprisingly also anti-masker. also threw small fit county told put house number house manner would visible police/fire/emt people. Man trying oppress apparently. open; Dressing rooms not.

Bathrooms essential, dressing rooms bring family eat; bring anybody Dr. appointment.

Dr's offices higher risk everybody involved... that's sick people and/or higher risk people go, want minimize exposure. Restaurants going proportionally lower number sick people given put money tray drive-thru, cashier touches money put register touching bag put back tray money give you.

This make feel better. Surface transfer unlikely anyway. Besides, drive thrus around wear gloves separate people handling money vs handling food. even hold card-reader window customer swipe card visit inmates; cannot visit grandma nursing home.

inmates extremely high mortality risk compared rest population. Nursing homes enclosed facility full highest-risk-for-serious-infection population bad enough medical/mental condition longer live alone safely.

These obvious couple moments critical thinking. ...This actually good news!
(I live America, else need explain?) Could true, low % extrapolated huge population wide error range. Think 3rd party minor primary candidates often poll 3% get nothing election day.

Tens millions sure though 100m hardly inconceivable. Local counties/cities/businesses still free set local mask, social distancing guidelines. 

Which point. idea rare is, getting common time. oH hEaRd iMmUnItY IsNt wOrKiNg sWeDeN 

Fuck people dumb. Cases going continue rise unless lock people houses. starts open universities, stadiums etc. cases come. People things contact multiple people need stop visiting 80 year old grandparents going care homes. somehow stopped (which won’t) I’m pretty sure deaths would 2 month. 

Cases increasing isn’t bad surprising, it’s natural global pandemic. spreading unhealthy elderly people issue. Trump. Trump asked DeSantis shoot someone 5th Avenue, Mini-Me flinch. It’s effectiveness generally 20-40%, many view ineffective. Sure there’s reduced chance, many also take account preventative measures (eg vitamin supplementation, diet factors) “comparable” level effect boosting immune system. lot people sub seem think it’s vaccines stop disease tracks useful, factors work conjunction. 

Additionally, allergies vaccine ingredients (eggs, example) prevent one taking vaccine. 7 percent still expected, seeing hasnt going long them. Nose breathers I'm tired pandemic fatigue. melting bar chocolate would definitely help...and I'll take one now, please! care 

Ding ding ding goes show weak species can't sacrifice sit home single fucking year. insane, coming species used live caves fought insane events make cushy lifestyle basically ton big brats can't give going bar. smug smiley face end sentence tells close ripping genetic differences races relate IQ. dunno, slight inkling someone obsessed ""genetic differences"" race. really smart virus. put protest signs dinner table guys safe. /s Deaths reported today spread 15/9 26/9. Average CODI-19 deaths per day Sweden September 1.9 per day. Days highest deaths recorded month 11/9 6 deaths followed 20/9 4. days 3 deaths lower now.

And know well reported deaths last 24 hours even reporting large gap. Arrest them. Fine them. Isolate them. meantime, people partying everywhere, like Florida restaurants bars reopened. I'm sort point say let eat cake. want. decisions made people duly elected. Let's quit helicopter parent telling everyone best without even asking. people, communities, even states whole basically OK reopening. let them. needed root canal 3 weeks ago saw one dentost nose surgical mask shit wear one patients. pissed know head dentist owns branch immune compromised (also voted Trump go figure) seemed take seriously. complain great affordable + dentists work wear full PPE gear, think find new dentist.. Okay cool, cant open everything wear masks? cant go football games, concerts, etc.? Glasses fog up. I'm genuinely confused - governor lifted orders made levels' government orders unenforceable, all-clear 1,000 person parties?

Don't get wrong, think reprehensible actually go one right now, sure authority shut down. like it! old reverse psychology double-grift whammo! link Thank ❤ fun games country one bullied ""save world"" aka meet agricultural lobby interests. badly made hypocrisy. heard propaganda history books confess believe true. I'm seeing eyes. Agreed, seems kind muddled.

I guess *trying* say, since expert quoted says “The virus spread primarily massive shedding nose mouth"", transmission surfaces rare dealing someone known infection, presume ""massively shed"" things? Depends, talking lots current 45-year-olds dying heart attacks age 65 otherwise would lived age 85 hadn’t caught COVID? would cause way fewer social economic problems large numbers current 25-year-olds surviving COVID dying heart attacks age 45, distinct possibility. prospect millions people new lifelong chronic conditions would economically devastating, already struggling healthcare costs rising faster inflation. 

But kind growing problem people living long beyond retirement, projected strain Medicare Social Security near future long pandemic. humans simply can’t generate enough economic activity ages 22 65 support living costs additional 30 years stop working. used think this, know idiot chief understood dangerous virus fucking February. people know dangerous constituents, care. Lungs take recover no. large scale (so, counting tiny isolated community there). clever. Didn’t say cluster Stueben Rockland something? Facebook. Yeah would mean catching 10% cases, yikes. pretending reelecting Trump important people dying. Tbh I've heard reason test people without/before symptoms viral load low show positive result even infected. 

So guess real option either get quarantine, stay somewhere else couple weeks. mom...she's adult. She'll take whatever measures able to. Fortunately studies heavily criticized involve lab conditions greatly improve survivability virus begin unrealistically high concentration virus particles (higher would expect multiple sneezes).

There also issue dosage may small number surviving viruses surface days, enough infect unless immediately lick hand. It’s principle behind outdoors social distancing work well, it’s zero viruses reaching you, it’s aren’t concentrated enough get past immune system cause infection. one posted video, ""YoU LiED To"". fucking nuts dude. Masks work. Deal it. Nothing works Hawaii, seemed ignorant poor lived there. state crunched money, option schools open Monday Thursday, Fridays, cut football. Lots parent outrage, lots discussion kept football. heard many folks say things like, ""without football kids hope chance future"". 
At least Oahu, one biggest incomes island 5 big military bases, tourism equal close second. many parts island deemed dangerous dont want walk through, Wimenila, aka Hawaiian Compton.  actually, keep average rate transmission 1, would pretty much die out. 

herd immunity rate transmission 1 without mitigation factors. published yet. Says article. think deaths actually 27x actually are? That’s awesome. It’s year away, least there’s end sight. got this. Works phone, husbands. 😂 remember working well, kill sense smell don’t understand either. looks uncomfortable wearing mask properly. Basically experts say September 2021, probably earlier that.

Honestly September 2021 sounds great point. want date mentally work towards instead total uncertainly week week month month. live, driver, I'd get ticket passengers wearing seatbelt.

I would refuse move car anyone buckled up.  Limiting parties? Umm no, ban them. years back, kids got sick immediately flu shot. think minute ""what's point?"" don’t think Walmart good example state.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* whataboutism damn thing. Yep. That’s Republican way. thought vaccine called vodnik something eliminated covid DeSantis also said order would stop cities counties fining people wearing mandated face say sounded silly. understand logic behind imagine would happen specific instance. tell me, *how* exactly relevant CDC's advice, even pandemic general? Surely nothing go wrong... thinking virus become politicized actually dangerous. necessarily agree however, become extremely politicized media people. one side one election longer political debate topic. 

That's thought process least.

Oh well! long go we’re (Victorians) finally able join rest country freedom. I’m grateful everyday majority Australians weren’t stupid enough politicise virus think wearing mask infringement ones’ rights. 🤷‍♂️

Just excited fucking awesome, well-deserved Christmas hot, glaring Aussie sun! lie. March April, changes tune encourages public wear cloth masks. know. watched press conferences. Yea went vacation Florida last week thinking would precautions used to. Shit terrifying: massive crowds, masks, social distancing. chaos lurking r/stimuluscheck too? hate unemployed 😆 energy PPP scammers either it’s poor poor there. lots complicated bits: reopen schools shops one countries struggling with.

That’s pharmacies overwhelmed vaccines minimal hours pharmacist likely lost hope Speaking - it, fatigue meant pause catch breath halfway flight stairs. I’m normally healthy could likely jog couple miles without stopping (but breath end). 

I think fatigue stemmed slower blood flow, body got less oxygen. 

Also contributed mind fog, which, retrospect, bit like concussion. Difficult focus even one thing time, greatly decreased processing skills. mean, nothing new surprising. general, certain states federal government underplaying virus getgo (along political divides, less) there’s nothing suggest ever change. everything minimize portray sense normalcy helps politically base believes virus sort foreign hoax. 

Protect yourself, protect loved ones. That’s legitimately do. I’d highly suggest getting pack KN95’s even considering reusable P100 extra filters need public often (work, example). Although cloth mask definitely superior going maskless, would highly suggest upping personal protection getting mask significantly cut risk inhaling virus particles. 

If virus exploding area, also doff clothing carefully soon return home. Stand doorstep remove outward facing garments put straight wash.

Sanitize / wash hands often can. Use gloves need touch lot surfaces public. Don’t remove mask anything you’re closed, recirculated air building. Eat home car can. 

Seriously all, we’re past point US Government reasonably protecting citizens. suggest taking precautions possible. people going maskless going inevitably catch COVID, doesn’t mean family need catch too. deep article one Korean company SD biosensor second US company Abbott.

I traveling air seeing family normally see though. that's me. read article you’re commenting on? think compare trump merkel, sure politicians shit, Germany crumpling much America (atleast experience German) people less ok decisions made merkel German government. Lots people probably even already scarves winter face coverings would've better nothing. still feel like early days claiming people need masks absurdly bad call. think, ""students"" supposed smart ones.

That's good image Floriduh. is. unis hung dry need answer serious questions it’s happened, courses taking place quite rightly, cases halls quarantine lock required. £13k still getting education better nothing, business lost £200k covid I’ve suck up. Friend refused wear seatbelt long journey ""uncomfortable"" waited fall asleep safely emergency stop. slid backseat, smashed seat almost folded it. worn belt rest trip believe science, believe bad science. 

If 30-40% India already infected bothering anything all? get whole country infected go normal life. death count becomes low almost laugh worthy then, effect country whole world unwarranted then. 14th 16th now. Pretty much ones stalling opening schools teachers unions, least Broward Oh goody! can’t wait fly Los Angeles commercial airline touch booth merch comics weekend... Dude, moved away Florida eight years ago. tell stories college days Tallahassee, people’s eyes get huge ask went school third world country. 

The longer I’m away, insane feels there. Every time visit family crazy culture shock. 

Run, don’t walk away. nothing Florida. call campaign rallies Trump. Getting married Trump. Etc. good then. Domestic air travel carries risks. decide whether risks worth see mother. know things look like December right now. Indiana mask mandate ends October 17th we're "" better "". I'm like, yes point ending working...? 11 vaccines phase 3, historically speaking, infectious disease vaccine candidates made far 85% success. bit rough math suggest probability 11 fail close zero. could say working parent struggling work children online school. Many people trouble managing both. yep, leave house N95 Mask. 25 50, think good idea.

Our tango club allows 10 couples DJ organizer, lot rules too, like pre-registration minimal partner exchanges. That's also amount room maintain social distancing. 

This German city aprox 50 active cases, less 2000 total. That's generalizing hell lot. fine. Floridian, used judging. remember purple state... half Republican half Democrat. 

And also people move cold weather blows. freeze 78 many people around feel same. Funny thing people say Trump authoritarian nobody bats eye Merkel 15 years power. Purely anecdotal evidence. subreddits people post Covid experience, families Covid experience, I’d expect see lot reports lingering symptoms do. Non-scientific, know, it’s best 6am Ditto. It’s like forgetting put pants. majority cases stemming South Florida, Tamp area. dodge nothing. 

I recall President mentioning coronavirus State Union. Remember, one Pelosi ripped up? also recall President wanting stop flights China left crying wacist. recall Pelosi mugging camera Chinatown encouraging people visit. forget, large groups people gather, well...except protests. approved left cry spreading virus those, they? right handling appropriately? Nope. left's hands clean either.

Don't sanctimonious willing call dirty handling situation sides. truth is, plenty ordinary folks right take seriously. we're pissed think hoax well. point. 

Have good day, pray family stay healthy. Yes. reason get education see red's idiocracy easily really know. Look bad got Memorial Day, 4th July? We're headed holiday season pandemic weary people sure travel gather seed infection country. top that, kids went college campus learning return home winter break. could definitely envision scenario dense epidemics coast coast January, stretching resources limit. That's nightmare scenario. hope people smart holiday season stay home, I'll honest, I've kind lost faith people right thing. ah, that's friend's dad lives PA April Sept every virus existence reinfection small extent

And reinfect people large extent. Immunity common cold coronaviruses, example, last long people keep getting over. 

Note made claim proven cases reinfection prove common. made statements without justification like doing. Rather, I'm saying know. 

You can't say since idea, going pretend like know sure COVID-19 reinfection. Unfortunately require real strange preteqs “how ignore constituents” 301 filled year. believe italy safest place europe right now. know horrors pandemic. true, allows see 20% ugly face. gets front page, sub chose ignore another FL schools reopened en masse, surge coronavirus follow, USA TODAY analysis finds

You really hate good news, don’t you? Look definition science. doesn’t tell anything, field study. science tell us lockdown flu, kills hundreds thousands year? elected officials actually make policy. Theatre (movie stage) industry going look whole lot different end this. Even cure discovered tomorrow rolled nation wide end year people's patterns shifted hard.  money arts hand. sure ain't money arts can't even get Congress agree people stay home. places survive large private endowments forms patronage. Well known troll thinkings it, makes think damn honorly system they've got going elemental schools survival fitness extra steps. Got stretched out. There's fascism it. People going die well time, old people, middle-aged children morons started new wave infections.

It's bad enough President shit like this. Fair opinion. We'll see removed process remains. 

My point reply trust specific administration versus party general.  rasp pi hole changed life home. ads entire household would thought governor declared professional wrestling ""essential"" fails keen grasp obvious? faculty meeting today hopefully things changed yesterday vice principal informed back 5th would come Thursday Friday school decorate get classes ready. “It convenient” Gov. Newsom said got colonoscopy State State address disagree? Masks mandatory indoors outdoors Spain except eating restaurant (you still put eating), like Italy.

Cases growing countries much Spain among things little contact tracing. point still get control even high mask use (+90%) compliance rules. simple. impossible flu shot give someone flu. However get mild symptoms. breathe class good... Yeah study little misleading. know someone ICU 7 days week getting released hospital back jogging light work outs issues. Obviously probably different many people feel like that’s crazy recovery time. 19, probably best shape life too, double pneumonia took 3 weeks get back point. ""...for getting caught murdering people."" 

FIFY Uhm... 

People going celebrate holidays Covid. people meeting safely taking precautions end world.

Now, person makes sounds like 20-30 people gathering one house kind silly, there's zero chance people going cancel holidays see family members.   Uhm arent half supposed normal half above... anyway?  effects come treatment, virus itself.  breathing tube long time create stress anxiety least. What? I'm making $31K I'm Brooklyn. call dick faces assume notably different men right? still surprising... Hmm remember went effect MD. many bars care still let happen even though illegal. change happen overnight. pictures Bergamo military trucks brought corpses dead nearby cities local crematories overwhelmed helped al lot. stupid idiots whining measures nobody sane care them. people going use term ""Spanish Flu"" 1918 epidemic, even though even originate Spain, issue term ""China Virus"". terribly uncommon pneumonia covid19. virus causes lung tissue inflammation, possible virus caused pneumonia develop. 

I hope dad recovers soon. hahahahahaha fucking good need stay home becuase already trouble breathing catch covid dead outright ban parties go underground, would like prohibition era parties gatherings. No, he's one standing deep state!

Yeah, got nothin'. “Most Americans never leave state.”
 
Sauce? sub fucking joke. Yeah every rational person knows average user r/coronavirus isn’t rational. 

The time spend sub I’m convinced people *want* covid dangerous possible. I’m sure why. confirm previously held beliefs feel ‘right’? continue living world minimal social contact normalized they’re weird shut anymore? 

Whatever is, sub eats droplet information merely insinuates corona dangerous thought thus far studies news data showing maybe corona isn’t fucking Black Plague routinely ignored around here. need start trend farting pass anywhere near people. love comments like this.

Not saying wrong.. "" long term "" incredibly hard quantify given virus less year old. weird disease. mild symptomatic case Covid19 recovered, sense fever lasted three days. there's long tail fatigue, depression, anxiety, milder symptoms like congestion cough. Even month exposure date, I'm still feeling 100%. Usually bad cold even flu (which twice MUCH unpleasant Covid), period bounce back completely day two symptoms resolved, energy levels mood increase quickly. feels like launched cannon taking stimulants.

I experienced Covid. feel ""no longer sick"" now, still can't say 100% really day woke felt ""oh, I'm back normal now."" could attributed slowly symptoms resolve disease, perhaps really damage completely repaired recovered yet. noticed inability things could getting infected, like working daily activities you, general sense completely back normal. Could subjective. Hard say, definitely weird experience overall, even though fortunate mild case trouble breathing. need national ad campaign stop Dick-Nosing. nose connected lungs, jackass. “Dick Nose” diagram made official literature governments idea something average 99.95% benign means u worry asinine. 

Especially know healthcare workers died thousands. business trade show industry. happening, handling complete norm industry. Every large 25,000-150,000 person trade show months, cancel closer date. likely often issue needing closer refunds/insurance claims based local mandates. See: AAPEX, SEMA, DSE, rock roll marathons, ASI, etc etc. half wears chin say long infection was. I've read people recovered smell/taste weeks. article mentions study next year though. pedantic. contributing anything worth reading. Duh There's 99% survival rate, sure.

The long term disability rate lot concerning. It’s understanding myocarditis common colds, pneumonia flu too. goes away. one babbling lost generations long term side effects there. Frankly, even long term side effects virus didn’t exist 9 months ago? Yes know serious (very few, percentage wise) people die. Pretty sure remember teen girl denier beginning licked toilet seat wound icu hearing 8 months now. People taking masks kiss evidence masks less effective. It’s evidence masks work people wear them. interesting thing NFL actually aware [testing accounts it. result they’ve one actual positive six weeks practice games. Dude, sound like I’m virologist, every virus existence reinfection small extent. happens strain flu people. Yes, understand this. bf order several types still 100% happy. look forward going maskless someday. said, saving old people even kids worth “uncomfortable“ way stand wearing esp gets damp inside (yuck)  Still lower Mondays 🤷‍♂️ I'm rideshare driver. require pax wear mask. exceptions, excuses. least day idiot says "" president doesnt wear mask! president says covid fake"" so, many many times hearing I've decided response "" ok ask president drive ass Wal-Mart I'm out"" Everyone tested antibodies, studies showing long term damage ppl never knew Covid-19. course super spreader events disasters. 

BTW idea actual science CDC guidelines apparently corrupted Trump administration. Seems par course.

[Trump administration pressured CDC play risks reopening schools: started cutting soda I'm drinking tap water often, push-ups I'm going gym understand people go far put mask miss nose? definitely deliberate. Maybe, point article slam trump? write bunch sciency stuff that. point is, want teach people, step 1 show objective. talking trump 'bragging', introducing writer's bias stating opinion. Suddenly shifts informative scientific piece tabloid hit job. handle facts? facts disease highly contagious deadly. facts large crowd indoors high risk transmission. opinion means fuck-all compared facts. 

Advocating dangerous behaviors based ‘opinion’ idiotic, selfish, beyond stupid. little voice head doesn’t know shit compared doctors, epidemiologists, public health experts. Get bent. Glad lucky tenth :) anything useful say?  Bad bot. many purely political posts sub yet dont delete those. bot prolly liberal. attacked liberal. Yeah, put constituents mess trying pretend issue first place. Bro, century pandemic, people pretending already first wave even finished. ""globalist"" dog whistle anti-semitism? Wait enriching greatly debt, lol? places underreport others declare everything CV19. Please hang there, normal, sane people world need support doing! many people completely brainwashed it’s disturbing! ICU nurse roommate would console listening people say awful conspiracy garbage. People far rabbit hole, completely disconnected reality. Doesn’t mean reality disconnected you’ve seen. trolling, suspect

Sbreddit: Coronavirus	
Total Karma: -931 Here's know:

- reinfection possible least people reinfected (as shown genetic sequencing proving people got two different strains different times).

- people gotten reinfected different symptoms time (ranging asymptomatic less severe severe)

Here's know:

- people get reinfected strain?

- even ""long haulers"" people gotten reinfected multiple times?

- reinfection rate changing time?

- so, timeline like?

- many people gotten reinfected\how rare reinfection?

We almost data questions, can't say ""well, since data, I'm going confidently say rare"". THAT'S science works. know, fucking trash. Administrative salaries roof teachers paid like shit. They're forced back campuses even they're cities high outbreaks occurring. They're baby sitters! countries masks compulsory, spread takes place people wearing masks. Like restaurants, night clubs, private parties, church dinners, etc. seen everywhere. don’t get point removing mask fines is. understand, don’t agree with, allowing restaurants bars go full capacity... economy that. point removing mask fines? Masks don’t hurt economy people shopping, going gym, anything else ppl never actually knew it?  Whatever attribute to, 200k Americans died year last year. 

USA 2020 excess deaths vs 2019

≥200,000 careful mask get wet sweat that's good far bacteria. Big brain move confirm dictatorship hid oven.  killed Cool J use coronavirus vaccine? bastards! lot Americans didn’t care community spread. Weddings happened illegally, 100+ person birthday parties, etc.

When family goes wedding, someone it, there’s good chance large number people know get it.  sure I’m disputing decimal points. I’m pointing reason caught steam positive take previous situation. numbers 2 percent demographics. get crowd skews much good amount people read improved treating it. maybe work towards electoral college degree November gone, troll. Yes. happened 50 years ago. Wearing mask like like wearing condom testicles. really quite simple understand people ever worked children. get way, throwing tantrum, they'll try smallest acts rebellion manage without scolded further. shit many factors may affect disease severity generally control, viral load. Got mine around week ago. hurt despite anticipatory anxiety prior shot. Area around flu shot mild dull pain around 48 hours. **I Level 1 ASD; diagnosed December 2019 intense special interest pop punk (and related things Warped Tour, formative years: around mid-2000s early 2010s)**. Less going tortured endlessly. couple years, many vulnerable kill off, going small bits lung heart neuro damage infection eats away health live long enough completely fucking trashed time get middle aged retired. long term studies original SARS survivors bleak. Although COVID less virulent cause concern based SARS studies observed far COVID. anything risk downplayed people justify selfish actions attempt cope anxiety denying reality.  okay compared countries absolute disaster, horribly comparison countries actually well. telling wear condom balls protect me!? Oh wait guess balls kind like dick's chin analogy apt. real did. drunk. included original post. days, literally everything anyone posts could go 
r/thathappened, I’m offended means. Ok perfect! Stay safe healthy :-) No, dumbass. That's kills immediately.

Guess absolutely data on?

What people long term. 37 pneumonia late last year “COVID like” sickness... trouble breathing months after. It’s almost year later still get winded earlier should. pandemic health consequences beyond death. They're old stubborn feel like can't breathe whole face covered. it’s like vaccines sit around distribution center months time...they flying shelves like hot cakes! Right. hospital, but, example, there’s one athlete trying recover barely walk driveway. going take care kids one like that? Let’s say husband: take care kids alone, also take care husband, can’t work. It’s much risk.

Can ask: old kids?

I also wanted say: came it, I’d quit job homeschool. Take 10% tax hit early withdraw 401k? Absolutely. won’t “all over” September 1, 2021, risk self isolating lower effective vaccine widely used. IMO, face masks public less stay. everyone else value taken away layoffs. landlords banks spared? us? Yea I'd rather give government even control personal life. Thanks though wear masks. required school. public buildings exceptions kinda to.

So guess agreement. Lockdown fucking stupid people going living lives-with mask caution vague, I'm female, 66"", 140-150 lbs (lack exercise dependent) healthy overall. I'm military, get physicals yearly, plus little bit I'm special status, PT tests, good jazz. really want support fav creators, send buck PayPal/Patreon buy merch them, helps way more.

Would many people really though?

If site obnoxious ads, close window don’t go it. reputable sites reasonable. people realize adjust wire nose course cant tell case they're nutcases now. Viral load random factor (mostly) cannot control excellent example mean. 

A mild case likely exposed low viral load. next time person previously exposed low viral load, likely exposed higher viral load, vice versa. don’t think it’s “huge tragedy” also think wouldn’t OK shoot head. less dramatically, don’t think drunk driver receive reduced sentence killed someone 75 rather someone 40. 

And devastating lose beloved parent grandparent, even pretty old. Middle-aged people reasonable expectation parents high graduations. It’s sad doesn’t come true. 

Also, I’m sorry grandmother. I’m big proponent death dignity. want make old age it’s important ability move choose. One thing scares loss autonomy. I’m afraid position I’m happy enough keep living maybe I’ll end trapped nursing home without way leave. Hopefully someone could advocate least I’ll opportunity manufacture end. Press nose wire mask sealed better bridge nose. 

Even non-medical masks nose wire this. get satire, one mother’s coworkers threw fit called wearing mask nose like argument thought could get covid breathing mouth. wish kidding. DEMAND SPOON FED EVERYTHING joke, man. *There seems sign intelligent life anywhere* would say that's good use. really insensitive joke make think it. Thank you. hope orange ape goes away followers crawl back caves &amp; rest us move on. misuse term ""side effects"" caused disease? headline say ""Nine ten 'officially recovered' Covid patients fully recovered""? trying frame argument way never occurred really seem like wise way restaurants mass gatherings

I suggest mass gatherings. Except pretend suggest that, nothing making strawman trying argue that. 

Please refrain leaning logical fallacies much make points. rely good look. Learn statistics. Take literally statistics 101. Learn selection bias. literally basic stuff. come fight armed soggy cardboard tube. Public shaming affect them, care people think. People grab luggage way burning airplane. People trample others stampede escape. people wear masks pandemic. Millions millions people care one whit people, can't make care. fine punish, going take lot resources, prioritize. There's good chance person wearing mask correctly care live die, certainly care disapprove mask wearing technique. literally meme headline would've expected plague inc back started xD laughed this. 

Thanks. anti-science. antivaxxer. believes never truly went moon. uses govt funding pet projects yet calls stimulus checks people. Yet still cult experience there’s third group. Older people ill fitting masks keep falling down. attribute couple things, one use wearing mask lacking mental flexibility think it, two access higher quality well fitting masks. heavy internet user decent income pretty trivial acquire variety masks try found satisfactory design fit, job requires masks vital so. Older retired people don’t need figure they’re buying whatever find walking around nose out. Ghosts lots 57 year olds agree statement. anything stimulates human system normal amount diminishing returns time dip normal stimulant longer received. Further, negatives high immune system activity. people level auto-immune issues, presenting get older. Yeah, still signs doors saying masks required, people ignore them. Employees wearing masks, still.

I point guy definitely drunk. could smell alcohol sweat masks. still, aggravating. think right. Germany emphasises health economy (unless pupil teacher - economy emphasis). like triangle get choose two three, can't three things. thing Germany restricts parties wholeheartedly agree - parties big crowds alcohol unnecessary, even dangerous, right now. mentality even ""control"" 2100 guess things necessities, well-being life pains see people this. Sometimes want snatch mask let retract back face. idea wearing masks become “normal” places cities mandate worn times. places much definitely mandatory entering stores. I’m follow rules keep safe keep others safe well. see folks nonchalant attitude towards wearing mask properly offends me. want end need part matter hard may breathe em uncomfortable makes feel wearing mask doesn’t go certain outfit have. wear properly. Coronavirus killed stomach acid, would simply using nasal plugs breathing ones mouth sufficient reduce infection rates since virus would swallowed hence destroyed, pass lining mouth cause infection? feel like am. “Oh it’s okay little (big) Timmy. go irresponsible adults stay home take responsibility seriously. go fun I’m staying home working go shit bar get drunk. It’s okay piss away responsibility” 

Sorry homie fuck that. god damn adult take responsibility. aimed you, timmys want act like isn’t thing gets store satisfying tiny dicked need pretend they’re “stronger” rules. Chainsaws warning labels they’re used around genitals... I’ll share peoples carriage now, three aren’t wearing mask 2 this. hear ""it fogs glasses"" often. tell shaving cream every day keep fogging up. stare say 'yeah... thanks.' /: Let’s say covid moderate disease become milder severe depending many different factors viral load current state infected (other infections, sleep deprivation etc). 

We don’t control factors treat random. 

When person get mild disease likely positively affected factors. person gets severe disease likely negatively affected factors. However repeat infection unlikely extreme case (I.e. mild severe case) affected way factors. 

Thus, severe mild case likely regress towards moderate case (I.e. mean) second time. Good. Means vaccines go deserving one. call nosers? got call great-uncle tested positive covid moved care home hospital. one allowed see since March. one allowed see hospital either. He's early 80s. make it'll second family/friend group pass away this. frustrating see happen see what's going FL time.  shit understand number fine. there's big difference 324 several thousand. go to. ""Your dick's out"" garners lot confused looks Dick Nose community many laughs personally. worked couple times though get cover dick nose. they’re ignorant, selfish assholes. get plenty fresh air properly fitting mask. Lazy stupid? Interesting point, room immigrant laborers economy...

For example, many farmers hire work American citizens would willing do. July 14th Wearing condom balls work. NHL disagrees. Humidity dropping quickly across US. think going change things worse, droplets aerosols start thwarting usefulness masks social distancing. Smaller particles hang longer, travel further, get masks people wearing.

Look places well shitty. looks related.  Wearing mask nose like wearing pants dong see use toilet brush clean sink, same! investigate horror reports maids hotels. Stupid Fool. Fauci: This, unironically awful. local grocery store day looking peaches cobbler sudden older gentleman mask well nose strides in, reaches grape bag front store, takes grape eats right there! Show Trump tweet July stated wearing mask Patriotic Duty. Agreed. see dip cases 2 weeks ago, corresponding good era return school early September. surprising dip deaths 2 weeks later, increasing death toll October. 300lbs can’t walk 10 feet mask without dying due terrible shape. 

I’m kind tired seeing every single day Israel emerges top destination spoiled fucking rich kids questionable politics whose biggest hardship pandemic mild boredom. ""cognitive disability"" already suggested 7x effort people willing give. fog true issue here. Welcome state headlines?

That's like saying:

""If listened first two minutes hour long discussion, would believing something completely different heard full discussion!""

No value added original comment. beginning end $$$ sports ball say...?

Next thing tell wearing condom balls like wearing condom all... Thanks sources.  👍 I'm told depends protest about. state outbreaks associated schools prisons nursing homes combined. model used shut us said everything right, would 250,000 deaths may 5th.

Once common knowledge wrong, switched ""cases"", cases, covid disease virus, show symptoms, disease, infection sars-cov-2. Also 90% false positives.

Here 6 months flatten curve, fear porn addicts miss every goal post change. 🙄 ""After hours pull nose long mouth covered that's important""

-My 87 year old grandmother 

🤦‍♀️ No, can't.

Most health experts agreement daily life may remain disrupted vaccine launch. Dr. Fauci think normal life return several months vaccine rollout. (Even *that* likely happen middle next year, according CDC pharm companies.) Sam Baker Alison Snyder think either; words, ""it's vaccine arrives"". Dr. Offit, *former vaccine developer*, low expectations vaccine's efficacy, reasons still need mask socially distance least one year following widespread distribution vaccine.

Do trust experts, would rather believe *whatever think sounds best*? goodness' sake, set *realistic* goals predictions. know truth might sound optimistic, but, well, truth. much hope riding breakthrough, vaccine beginning end. saying wear masks? Masks essential. 

Even younger people get seriously ill. Even numbers 0.1%, thats .1% nobody endure. 

And prevalent virus general society is, dangerous gets thr old immunocompromised. People cannot stay home time. need groceries. need doctor's visits. need access healthcare general. 

Idk lets continue arguing really think wear masks.  scroll way far. reason. They're mouth breathers. sisters want everyone else isolate to. Everyone: ""I spring I'm good lets go Vegas + Florida""

Everyone winter: ""What mean again???"" wearing it. Look virus microscope idiots shit. hoping Covid would cherry gummed whole profit-from-destruction cycle

I see lot bad analogies Reddit every day one takes cake. Wo man I'm sorry hear that! Hope u OK. really unfair much government's job inforce inform importance covid rules, maybe consider buying expensive protective mask stay safe! ones partially protect others wearing mask well I'm talking about. Take care best luck hospitals labeling non Covid deaths Covid get money, according woman Florida waiting line front grocery store day. Don’t worry, didn’t get it. changed subject weather something. agree you, COVID clearly serious elderly certain pre-existing conditions. young people flu serious (or possible equally serious, consider young people could get flu schools fully open flu season social distancing masks). worst would mean flu COVID equal young people. agree sad deaths are, would never see type reporting flu season. Agree disagree, media would treat business usual seems pretty innocuous Florida income tax. Florida's tax revenue comes result property taxes taxes tourism related industries.

Without revenue, Florida shrink every level already incompetent government. mean one less employee per department mean ""who's gonna pay trash pick-up entire region population 50,000"" . that's happening Florida.

I solution poorly planning revenue streams event catastrophe. that's *what* happening. make masks little triangular peak nose reason. work 😂😂😂😂 true, case, infection caused Trump. Ignorance rampant wide spread long candidate. run it, way office.   dicknosing! always assume people don’t wash ass hands. You’re obedient, sit command well? Would like treat? read reddit iPad morning outside first coffee. Apple doesn’t allow add block mods browser system. absolutely blows mind follow link web see huge morass advertising garbage permeates web without ad block. rest day I’m PC everything fine c. I'm tired people polarizing issue. Allow make comparison get head article problematic, upvotes prove agree.

Growing 4 golden retrievers. varying shades gold long fluffy hair. Last summer, parents adopted new golden retriever. Based evidence gathered studying four golden retrievers, fifth golden gold long fluffy hair. That’s science article would point to.

Now here’s thing, puppy indeed pure bred golden retriever, science flawed. can’t make generalization puppy look like based four prior Goldens, didn’t look subtype.

See, first four dogs call show goldens, fluffy, beautiful, everything expect golden retriever. There’s another subtype however, called field golden retrievers. Field Goldens skinny, short fur, bred specifically hunting.

Where logic, article flawed, made guess fifth golden would look like based four show Goldens look like. looked parents puppy, would’ve found new puppy line FIELD Goldens, dark almost golden brown fur fluff whatsoever.

This article taking said applying disease. Like puppy technically golden, COVId technically coronavirus. like first four Goldens puppy, seasonal Coronaviruses Covid share next nothing common behave, mutate, work, kill. Mate simple?

 understand booster shot is. relevant point. also understand vaccines can't create longer immunity infected. undermine point.

For FINAL TIME say clearly. infection create immunity kind vaccines work. BASIC SCIENCE. 

Honestly get high horse. point, argument, trying create strawman assume certain things position true. It'd correct fact take precausions want still get infected, example coworkers. :/ Try yourself. nose, moves everywhere talk, constantly brushing lips, adjust every second. chin, makes ears hurt like mf. There’s also people wear tip nose, results sliding constantly, results fiddle constantly. know they’re sanitizing hands touching anything else. 

Masks everywhere now, it’s hard find one fits. fair, lot people, hand washing invented 6 months ago. early testing, school children receiving entering class? see rate infections rising (un)surprising amounts..right?(across schools; elementary, secondary post secondary). Guess one dont understand ASYMPTOMATIC carriers work..

the govt (and average US citizen) cares testing states sports player testing citizens children. That's USA grossly incorrect ideals. 

Again, notice drooling, cognitive impaired sports fans downvoting comments. Enjoy million dollar 2 week hospital stay, hope Covid-Ball worth it! 500 people stadium 50 000 hardly bizarre decision. long organisers guarantee social distancing, perfectly fine. “If someone’s got nose peeking out, it’s really different wearing mask,” Furness said. 

&amp;#x200B;

That seems unlikely - effective wearing properly definitely effective wearing one all.  Entitlement. “Those rules don’t apply me. I’m exceptional American.” look presos May later. may overlapping wrong zip codes ones ""spikes"" doesn’t hurt much unlike shots. Picking cat putting shoulder pin prick flu shot. Since faint easily focus slow breaths keep calves tensed. it’s first flu shot usually recommend sitting quietly 15 minutes leaving case reaction. sit relax take slow calming breaths. know that. 

again, know that. 

how say certainty know research updates: Tests reveal silent reinfections hospital workers “I fulfilled requirement...can buy scented candles speak manager!?!?!?!?” live GA follow someone facebook named Amber Schmidke worked CDC Mercer University PhD medical microbiology immunology. publishing updates numbers they're derived shows clearly step step reported whole newsletter reporting GA listed positive case, could go get 100 positive tests keeps case # increased one one case. GA also include 'rapid' test results case reporting, unlike southern states. Anyway want look facebook, look question CDC site Department Public Health area find that. know sick uninformed hive brain people like you. absolutely idea talking about. Go research. test approved multiple agencies. would fake inefficient one? Think instead following everyone around say. Don’t sheep.  work bank protection bank managers serious mask requirements. without backbone. got kicked site told women put put mask entering, husband came back fit rage cussing threatening me. lost site apparently aggressor. Sucks conclusions? specifically says online survey 16% participation rate. screams bias towards bad experiences.

The study published anywhere time. least English. extensive searching. give career professional dancer. son pre professional training training properly year pretty much end career. lose strength, technique flexibility take time off. 

All Pop Pops isolate. called stay home. i'm little surprised clarified publicized season. hope players union commissioner thought that, affect playoffs also contract incentives. I've fantasy telling without masks following: 

can get name pregnant wife (who handle covid cases ICU) breaks hundredth time another patient dying, tell people like keeping thing going instead something simple wearing mask properly. managed wear shirt mask difficult? Unlike federal government, states run deficit spending.

This sort crisis particular pretty good argument state able take debt run deficit short periods. case federal government going war crisis question. 

Only alternative shutdown state government, right? Idk handle budget shortfalls. want chart 7 day average Sunday 7 days ago (for example) gets knocked average replaced another Sunday. case Sunday's numbers typically low could say day week regardless whether usually low high reporting day. 

What want replace Saturday rolling average with, say, Wed/Thur generate 'wobble' moving average oscillation every 7 days even overall trend remains (same number cases always reported every Monday, number every Saturday, etc). exactly want graph look like things changing not. correlation individuals high fever symptoms could telogen. people otherwise asymptomatic unstressed would something. don’t understand you’re getting downvoted 
[Alarms Stockholm - spread infection WSJ too. best coronavirus reporting come Financial Times, perfunctory relevance markets, specific detailed depth stuff excess deaths different nations, heavily data based strong analysis top that. They’re either dumb, wear masks don’t get stopped entering stores. Plenty people sadly wouldn’t wear mask weren’t required one enter stores.  true cant put whole country house arrest police/military enforcing that. type Freedom movement constitution. lockdown certain areas regions. choose thought human suffering caused lockdown would greater shutting controlling ways.  Freddie better MVP, that’s imma say that. yeah said concerned might die one night. Crazy vast differences symptoms severity seen.  reason easier believe coronavirus just...a normal virus.

So beyond baffling. buildings don’t alleyways. close together.  breathe mouth 10% time, transmission would reduced mouth covering.

This headline would believe cough mask covers mouth, equivalent coughing without face covering all. simply cannot true. I'm sure much plainly explain this. 

Social interaction causing spread. 

Places people socially interact cause spread, provide people location spread it. 

Limiting places people encouraged socially interact wise policy slow people spreading covid. shit Came say something similar. coworker recovered covid fine whole time.

Titans / Steelers skip end 15 game season?  makes sense right thank you. No, Sweden better ""many"" countries all.

We're almost bad US. We're 11th worst world, compared neighboring countries we're disaster. Sweden practically island nation, could done well Iceland, South Korea Japan.

No, Sweden used right-wing populist strategy like US, Brazil, like UK Boris got ill. coincidence got numbers too. Right understand. Chronic permanent, least insurance. classification long term based insurance 90days, though many consider short term. think I'm suggesting distinction wording long term considering many fight illness month two.

I understand concern reddit illness important conflate effects chronic life long issues. sentiment everyone suggesting. websites Miami-Dade 50%, miss something?

Edit: actually Fl gov site Lists phase 2 50% also. It’s good thing Fauci charge me. I’d saying things like “wholly irresponsible” “straight fucking foolish” instead “very concerned.” lockdown forever drastically alter way life forever. Bin Laden would’ve enjoyed more. Isn’t terms conditions? that?! piece updated 4x since posted? cool use glove doorknob like that, I'm sure gross things end main garbage bathroom. concerning ""shit covered papers"" begin with, guy probably expect may ignorant gloves. work, 95% what's trash papers used dry hands washing, certainly shit covered... That’s circumstantial. OP making declarative statements content questions asked without seeing information facts. questions reported article. speculation personal bias push narrative didn’t want trust survey. NZ done well island isolated world lot visitors. Lol, ok. Sure report general news stories normal practise. business focused primarily, course, general news stories like relevance that. Seems like easy solution would store cans alley like friend lives high rise does. wouldn’t want pay rent landlord can’t even provide basic services like trash receptacle. Going grain here, consider good news. guy airplane used eye mask comes mind. true...it would still reduce stuff expel out, would protect others! ones know believe cannot breathe mask all. also know they'll get yelled wear mask. compromise. They're kind people drive speed limit cop around 15 time. Yeah thing condom. Doesnt mean shouldnt use condoms It’s ok mouth breathers anyway Brazil is, heavily Singapore guys hired called Safe Distancing Ambassadors (in uniform lanyards) everywhere — wet markets malls coffee shops even around residential estate. basically tell safe distancing put mask even you’re waiting food table. may like government much appreciate much efforts enforcement put curbing pandemic, think good move. Hopefully US make headway soon! course. remind students this! True. know history high community spread eventually find way people risk. So, it’s probably time lag rather true separation groups. We're fucked. Usually couple times day. Why? boogie? Wtf serious lol course not, respiratory virus somewhat damage lungs. Masks help much people think. People also reuse mask good. become less efficient time repeated use. way, anecdotal evidence 20 people knows plenty. cringed hard neck popped. relief ""Every 60 seconds America minute passes"" misinformation. Cuomo,never touted pre-existing immunity + seroprevalence = herd immunity pseudoscience. Wtf talking about?

Isn't entire gist theory spike occur areas 50% prevalence, even 40% 30% pre-existing immunity + 30% seroprevalence effect already meeting 60% natural threshold?

I repeatedly comment want people unnecessarily die heard pseudo-scientific speculation, dropped guard, encouraged others well. Sometimes comes proper fitting, especially blue surgical masks. mom often wears one always remind slipping nose, means ill, even realize starting slip nose. Selfish twat countries problem. UC Boulder asked happening CO next house. friend recovered said too! lost hair addition smell taste. Yeah, think priority easier transport vaccines sent poorer countries sophisticated vaccines used here. probably assumed getting away it. There's tons post people planning wedding ""it's unreasonable expect postpone further"". What’s even worse it’s even enforced medical facility. doctors office last week, three people masks nose waiting room. walked wearing mask way. checked staff staff never asked put proper. didn’t screen anyone already inside checked in. Bull fucking shit asthma masks affected all.  Hahaha love butt hurt getting don’t like city. New Yorkers ever heard garbage cans? Clearly time go there’s bags trash streets. Boston live put garbage cans doesn’t stink get torn apart rats. info. informed, even concerned without paranoid. obtuse purpose? hard. 

Vaccines work triggering immune system response way someone develops immunity infection. If, clear case said MULTIPLE TIMES THREAD, happen people get infection recover vaccine effective either. rely mechanisms. 

I denying vaccines. fact understand seemingly lot better you. understand vaccines work? basic science mate fighting this? extremely serious, contagious deadly illness, understand people afraid. long time people major risk. 

0-44 years old accounts roughly 3% covid deaths US. Add 45-64 around 20% ages 0-64. 65-74 another 20%. 75-84 another 25% 30% covid deaths 85+ age range.

Yes lingering symptoms yes know everything disease. reality given 10s millions infections US, conclusive evidence broadscale serious permanent complications chance death persons age 65 low, age 44 extremely low age 30 vanishingly rare.

It 6 months since first lock downs country completely sympathize persons almost statistically significant risk disease watching living second major economic catastrophe last 15 years. Especially persons risk die cause next years best.

Again, want clear I'm downplaying, understand perspective people have. friend contracted Covid. got back April recovered. still sense smell taste. also problems breathing every again. Right. would impossible researchers study manner did. Nostrils become Covid funnels. Social distancing *≠* Cleaning Furniture

Social distancing Cleaning furniture "" It’s either ban mass gatherings don’t ban none. It’s bullshit, can’t see that, don’t know tell you. Use brain . ""

How give 2nd grade English whirl, try again? hair too, also taste bud problems fatigue. Got covid March 12th. I'm trouble reconciling this. So, basically saying, ""Hey, million Americans going die. accept nobody wants take precautions"" point? 

That's we're ending damage economy mental health everything starting outstrip that. grim, grim science logic; also one many places around world forced accept. also literal worst case scenario still possible stabilize much, much earlier even tiny semblance social distancing ongoing.

Also, sorry, thought linked different NYT article. [This explains superspreader effect partially. tell first hand fatigue real separate thing.   
Sure stress anxiety increase it, but, case, things could February issue longer without experiencing major fatigue.   
And daily physical movement decreased changed much since then. (note: Covid March). agree Intergalactic. Obviously best nose mouth covered, say covering mouth nose makes wearing mask obsolete seem right. think positioning nose mouth. exhale nose air downward trajectory, exhale mouth air horizontal trajectory. ***No.***

A single measure going much. Mask mandates *alone* end pandemic. vaccine *alone* end pandemic. Rapid tests *alone* change pandemic.

**Only things *together* - learning *very* patient, simply *not* going end day, even week; let *anyone* fool believing - bring COVID case death counts safe enough levels resume normal life.** 1) (or can't) tell studies website basing numbers from;

It tells ***on fucking 2) read link gave you. 

You linked submission lmao. first thing read. also bunch dialysis patients- representative population.

What wrong you? Sorry 15% accurate 9% makes mad, reason. discussion getting doctors’ offices pharmacies? Set centralized vaccination site let people come get it. would gladly sit three hours bus meant could semblance normalcy afterwards. articles make erroneous comments. studying blood existing patients measure antibodies coronaviruses. annoying many people dick nose masks! antibodies, yes, that's part it. Cell immunity, cross immunity similar viruses, even less understood mechanisms.

Are examples hard hit places, hit second wave high death rate? seen yet. France reporting large case numbers, deaths astoundingly low. good news, sub seems put dark spin everything, gives credit human countermeasures ever possible.

(And ""That guy charge large country ***** BTW, lest anyone accusing camp) (LOL post got removed censor it) Cuomo de Blasio great job. It’s template nation. US fine, hospitals/doctors offices storage area vaccine stored required temperature. sucks 3rd world countries conditions would hard produce. Also called director clarify 2% told 2% positive results test administered entire Midwest. No... Play ""My conspiracy way crazy yours"" see soar popularity, like 5G... like premise: legal taser someone got video nose exposed public place time.

Taser sales go (good economy), people think twice wearing mask like (good controlling pandemic). No. New York great. It’s sucks. Don’t ever come again. one wants needs you. Piss off. virus? Death rate 45-64 trivial.  Noooo. family Brandon! Ok thanks. mom's birthday wants come Florida help yard sale. yard sale tell you!

I'm trying summon tell no, put flight yet again. devastated go? seems irresponsible. thought obvious. kept wondering people even mask mouth nose. take extreme point view like ""gonna die next week"", know nothing value support argument. took 5 months sense taste smell come back.   
Coming 7 months now, things almost back were. occasional chest pain fatigue new normal now.   
   
I found taking multi-vitamin past 3 weeks helped lot! First took Vitamin D, went multi-vitamin.   
   
I hear hair loss, already balding gotten rapid past 7 months. However, thinning already, there's way know speeded covid. Virus originate China, one US knew hit one wanted help. US even pulled CDC representative. want blame someone spread biological weapons look towards west, east. people special kind stupid Lol okay kid. People shouting top thier lungs inches perfectly fine. can’t rational conversations poeple. Bye. see ANYONE talking worrying this, tbh. whole thing scary long run too. good effects? Even that's becoming less less effective. 

In recent years become common see people light even getting anywhere near door, especially places like public transit. 

Until years ago think I've seen indoor smoking since maybe early 90's. (pre pandemic) every months dickhead lights stop next train, someone lights they're done register going head out.  many months going now? Thing patient. understand people say this. Viruses sentient can't understand something humans (and possibly chimpanzees) like elections. Even could, would care? misinformation believe, one makes least sense hurts brain most. see tricked masks (barely) anything else, entire fucking world play along stupid election conspiracy makes sense possible way. Petty rebellion. Trying display don’t care. That’s best guess. left's narrative Sweden locking bad idea much higher cases/deaths per capita. think they're wrong that. However, Sweden prove country citizens largely willing follow recommendations still fairly well without lockdown, that's nuance fairly represented left. said, context US, nuance rather irrelevant see Sweden's strategy could ever worked there. people really think Americans socially cohesive responsible Swedes?

On hand, right's narrative straight lying purely political purposes. certainly save lives, they're also opposed restrictions imposed Sweden, namely social distancing. right consistently brings comparisons NY Sweden ignoring that, despite NY's curve 4x higher Sweden's, places flattened curve timeframe. keep bringing herd immunity strategy shown work anywhere. Notably, think Sweden done poorly, right also disingenuously ignored Nordic countries done better lockdown without sacrificing economy freedoms process. still idea point anti-science narrative is.

I understand motives makes left taking blunt approach messaging via saving many lives possible. can't right. you? narrative sides seem true. Pretty sad ask experts common sense Thats actually case... garantee it.

Like friend who's caught chicken pox 3 times still titers. body recognize it. Welcome permanent lockdown, Israel. remember, two weeks! Anybody else costochondritis? I'm sick people harrassing others masks WEARING MOUTH I'm trouble reconciling this.

😆 Also I'm assuming recovered patient case someone admitted hospital. true, serious cases, course lasting effects. assumption true, *not* 9 10 people get infected. that's feels like read headline, it? Well according best friend lost uncle covid-she still thinks overhyped. obese past 60 healthy start with. chose go church without mask got covid. died. sad, still worried husband kids getting issues peak health. is. lets kids go dance people stuff ashamed yourself. people older doesn’t mean lives don’t matter. That’s figured :( Since we’ve infected blacks aids illnesses before, black community healthy distrust government medical organizations.  MERS still periodically pops middle east Central Asia. One bigger differences MERS, SARS-1, Covid MERS SARS-1 were/ deadlier, nowhere near contagious. So, here’s question none us probably answer to. messaging like previous pandemics? 1918, we’re government officials changing goalposts, hinting long term restrictive measures ‘opaque’ public? PM’s Justin Trudeau who’s government moved Flatten Curve (March) ‘We getting back normal without vaccine’ (April) ‘We need continue measures well vaccine delivered’ (Tam/Fauci - August/September) ? size shape mask face way issue. let explain natural herd immunity impossible means virus produce lasting immune response humans. case vaccine cannot work relies mechanisms.

Ok, let explain simply:

That simply necessarily true. example:

a) vaccines produce longer-lasting (and stronger) immunity infection 

b) get booster shots vaccine. lots vaccines ones development would boosters certain time intervals.

Why still arguing this? understand wrong point. incapable ever admitting it? studied this. already pieces come PANDEMIC scientists still seeing immune response blood taken SARS1 survivors decade it

This author evidence, it’s well established SARS confirmed 2 year MINIMUM immunity period. established 15 years ago

Edit: read it, noted mentioned SARS MERS briefly, solely discussed one study, ignoring studies already SARS MERS peer reviewed widely accepted election 5 weeks away. vaccine ready 'push through', hypothetical irrelevant. Dude read fucking webpage. willfully ignorant now.

You said guy pulled numbers ass clearly didn't. mistake. definitely hope not. get poked prodded yearly basis military, chest x-rays included. I'm reading symptoms post covid *tend* go away otherwise healthy individuals. That's I'm going right now, otherwise, I'll serious issues (like job). really. selfish people need prison  *being selfish asshole*. tell Grandmother-she lived 97 well off. expensive nursing home town begging die willing die years. told 70s ready die would happily accept time came. husband died, 100% ready. 

They nice gorgeous lake house everything. knew bodies slowing knew inevitable coming. 

So buy whole old great. Dude 40 year already like ""This sucks"". understand supposed scholarly, actually think article like totally ignores SARS MERS honestly unprofessional.

Did want release sars-1 mers back population study?

Edit: read guys. guy didn't. post text. Sure, makes logical sense would impact. It’s evidence big effect is. however irrefutable evidence something else going on, picture seen every single country didn’t experiment minorities. basic scientific design.

Another argument think - you’ll find minorities represented, especially Chinese. Why? tendency create sub cultures stick themselves. integrated minorities are, higher participation rate. Nothing obscure medical malpractice, I’m sure wouldn’t claim Chinese immigrants impacted American government black people. see anyone believe anything coming Chinese authorities. covered virus, finally blew face numbers sky-rocketed reached 85 000 cases, stopped. anyone believe numbers? eat sugar fart bubbles till die heart cells born ever have. incur damage eventually may cause problem. long-term data people who've virus since brand new.

The point sadly, right government making moves ensure people die economy *never* restart properly. 

We needed stronger lockdown, needed longer.

Local governments rushing openings hurt EVERYONE.

The point lockdown required, government needs support citizens proper, brief, lockdown. 

But PPP loans rolled poorly gridlocked Congress cannot figure do, every area government almost rudderless... are... 

Stuck economy cannot recover... segments NEVER recover (Movie Theaters, Nail / Hair Salons, many small businesses that, honestly, cannot survive gotten support.) 

But least 1% got even richer this... good them. 

My point is: Government supported wrong people pandemic. support workers, supported billionaires. 

Maybe, I'm spit-balling: electing less billionaires (Also maybe Billionaires exist). never compared flu go guess...... Georges Lemaître would call comment extremely ignorant. Yea, 7-day rolling average 755. Hey condescend multiple groups once! - Bloomberg probably. Unless, well-informed comment states, damage heal naturally little chance complications.

Do know circumstances obesity? judge don't? severe asthma osteoporosis medical condition means unable effectively exercise. Critics plan — many medical experts — say one test isn’t reassuring: fear people caught virus right traveling en route Hawaii means they’ll either contagious travel arrive islands.

That’s effectiveness test depends far illness progressed. Oxford University paper published Science estimated 45% infections spread carriers develop symptoms.

Honolulu emergency physician Dr. Darragh O’Carroll called even sensitive tests “practically useless” conducted first couple days someone contracts virus.

Instead, Hawaii medical research experts advocated testing travelers least twice: arrive catch infections may missed test taken prior travel. think he's hoping massive covid caseload scares voters away polls... Man, really triggered people initial comment. Cheers true.

I would go antibodies test every 90 days covered find tests. also understand vaccine work antibodies stay body? need vaccinate large group test antibodies 90 days see vaccine still effective.  okay well answered why. 112 degrees, one wants outside that.

any temperature forces people indoors speed spread.

there’s happy medium 60-90 degrees people spend majority time outdoors. 

112 might well 12 comes catalyst virus safe say political parties bought companies period time Hong Kong limited 2 cans per person 2 ""tubes"" Toilet paper. 

The cashier's check out. Said illegal. helped old man get 2 cans stuff (he 4).

It brief period, stopped supermarket running stuff. herd immunity cannot happen naturally due people developing immunity infection herd immunity via vaccine also impossible.

That's true. vaccinate lot people much shorter time. Remember people take actions prevent spread disease, like social distancing, makes take longer get number infected people needs get transmission 1 measures lifted. 

Moreover, point ""herd immunity:"" protect vulnerable getting disease, incredibly hard rampant spreading disease, vaccinations. Fall wave says “hi” lost soooo much hair grow back.

My state, New Jersey, pretty decent handle things summer getting hit hard first major wave nations experience virus. We've hovering around 200-400 cases per day since June occasional blips 500. 

We partially reopened schools indoor dining allowed resume 25% capacity three weeks ago. Ever since late last week, daily case counts steadily rising 600-700 new cases per day, rate we'll likely back 1,000 new cases per day mid October, weather get colder less humid, facilitating even conducive environment spread disease. see another major outbreak like previous spring, time areas largely spared worst last March-April, we're likely going track another lockdown Thanksgiving going Holiday season December. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid whichever form next lockdown take, occur, taken seriously first one. Covid scary brand new monster last spring anymore. People getting bored it. Misinformation propaganda disease precautions left propagate fester months state's case counts marginal put many false sense security complacency. 

We've watched summer south, midwest, west coasts uphill battles virus. watched states scoffed precautions learned hard way got hit steady increases cases deaths. watched one region would get handle things while, virus pop rapidly spread another, like game whack mole. We've gotten back dangerous mentality of, ""It can't happen here... again"", we're months away potentially seeing bite us ass again.  assumed following original position OP thread: “If current administration seizes power somehow wins election absolutely consider vaccine safe take one. sure alone there. anti-vaxer used make fun speculate horrible outcomes here, possibly even intentionally.”

Fortunately, again, Trump administration charge approving vaccines. still absolutely trust FDA, saying otherwise absurd point. Many medical conditions present differently males females, conditions rarely affect men tend receive less research attention. there's malicious intent behind mostly using cis male research subjects, moreso importance including women sometimes sight, mind. fair always better countries right tactics right societies. 

But Yeah agree you. also introduced alot expensive positive reinforcements (like giving money stay home work). would alot cheaper lock people using police/military. people ignore keep saying Sweden save economy. Thats definitely true. No. not. Even chronic pain classified 6mo. need kind metal strip fit around nose, like dust filtration masks have. People manufacturing, spraying, etc using decades. source excess? really hope you’re right. Honestly, do. want things return normal..... I’m skeptical. March said people wouldn’t put 6 months. Yet, are..... 

In addition - even get sick it. bars, concerts, sporting events, travel, cities general allowed open? hand forced government forcing us back houses ....? Try 3D cloth mask, solved fog issues! You’re idiot Nah it’s fucking hilarious Reddit full defund police crap love stop ""anyone it""

3. Indonesia Sounds like scooby doo episode wear mask glasses 8 hours day. takes little adjustment get dont fog up. DUH. mean really, people dumb AF wearing mask nose. people really *this* stupid think anything nose? think must mostly folks think need mask wearing one society compels to. people see young people without glasses. real reason feels better. mean yeah pretty much thinking saying before, ideally afford give accurate results mouth nose connected. aren’t covered, none are. understand completely. is.  Sweden keep rule maximum 50 people meet public, plans introduce exceptions rule **restaurants events spectators seated pass coronavirus**, government said Tuesday.

So, fuck Reuters choose image **shopping mall** exception 50-rule, main image article. Idiots. 

(There. Feels better now. Sorry language) They're ""living lives."" They're selfish. And, people die wedding, they'll also murderers... merely test antibodies? so, speculation T-cell immunity lasts longer antibodies? seems serosurveys helpful, perhaps provide full picture. I've pretty much stayed home since February aside groceries/prescriptions. wear mask home outside bedroom/bathroom.

But defend people saying government kidnap people. Telling someone kidnap someone else wrong, I'm always going speak see people suggest unwarranted. comfortable since rebreathing hot, humid, stale air. keep mouth pretend complying. Phase 2 75% capacity, restaurants followed Here's someone tell us someone even obese category 'not healthy'. 

Sounds like need medical procedure yourself, empathy transplant. Fuck Corona fuck feed People won’t put it. Simple Germany pretty much re-opened apart mass events.

The German idea restrict high-risk stuff important economy (private parties, discos, clubs, bars, restaurants...) order get winter without another lockdown.

Postponing surgeries anti-virus measure per se. measure system danger, screwed first place. Either face overload COVID-cases 50 FFP3 masks 800 bed hospital 3 large ICUs. France postponed electives Paris brink hcs there.

The truth economy vs. health. protecting health order also protect economy.

Btw herd immunity effect many people fantasize may never materialize HCoV-immunity complex short-lived. Due Covid? bacterial infection licking someone’s bare ass was? immunity rates need localized. ""Americans"" useless metric.""

The article discussed infection rates varied essentially zero states avoided infection midsummer, one-third residents parts New York hard-hit upshot American public long way achieving ""herd immunity"" – enough infections prevent spread virus. rates patchy even areas high infection rates, people unlikely protected others bring virus elsewhere**, said William Hanage, epidemiologist Harvard T.H. Chan School Public Health.  Nah, humans general really bad connecting events something can't see, hear, feel. like eating unhealthy food - know fact bad you, immediate repercussions indulge.

Why think many people get flu shot? they're narcissistic, they've never flu seems unnecessary.  Republicans refuse help American people since doesn’t benefit billionaires. 

They either reopen completely lose everything. Even case (which doubt is), worse promoting easy going attitude based statistical data accumulated less year virus hardly doubt expertise understanding? Virology hella complex. What’s happening April? source that? I’ve read times, I’ve looking study hand. Suck elope! Someone smoking act hard ignore, wearing mask properly indirect problem. ignore easily. sure downvoted. Alternet like Breitbart since Breitbart. Redditors say hate biased rags biased rag agrees politics.

Then suddenly ""yeah, biased, truth."" want play dumb games. going win dumb prizes. suppose communist government gets money? always boggles mind people trust government fucked testing, PPE distribution medical workers, masking, ""reopening"" somehow get vaccine distribution right.  How? People: “Why quarantine it’s sick vulnerable people die coronavirus? everyone affected health problems?”

Also people: “I shouldn’t wear mask, affecting everyone around me, health problems” is. Mostly involved civil/revenue law enforcement PD concentrate criminal matters. Yes, can. choose to. Coach Orgeron thinks LSU football team probably already it. ton people sub want get worse continue long possible.  okay well since you’re clarifying time frame you’re referring there’s way decide right.

iran hot spot february temp ranges 48-55 quite things said disturbed me, breaking air traffic controllers union really bothered me. Italian citizenship &amp; passport holder, family permanent residence country. 

They're also allowing people ""emotionally stable"" relationships Italians fly country visit.

So point I'm interestes specifics. Ask think countries farthest corners world give fuck presidential election?

Because impacted entire globe, 'merica

I'd love hear answer that... can't catch covid mass protesting / rioting / looting, apparently catch covid wedding. hypocrisy, run away NYC. funny think making realize want ramifications people actually rely state's governmental systems function (schools, infrastructure, unemployment benefits, etc.)

What awful time. able say, ""I'm wearing mask.""

What find strange comfortable wear correctly nose chin especially. Wearing mask uncomfortable shave while, straps uneven. Otherwise, usually forget even one on. Cry more, making point sensitive baby. really ""side effect"", effect sick. Never would’ve guessed. 

I find uncomfortable like this?? tried home don’t know people it. sits much better nose. +210,000 American deaths Covid-19 end today. “masks don’t work, Slovaks/Czechs don’t want this” astroturfers :( not, too... nations, least ones aren’t republics, limit number years head *government* sit, long support parlament. 

The POTUS basically lot direct powers almost European leader, there’s term limit. property taxes fine, trust me. pay less property taxes North Bend house suburb Cleveland house 1/4 value. Link, please? Fatigue, loss concentration, psychological disturbances subjective symptoms interpreted differently people.

This article fails mention many recovered patients participated hospitalized vs non hospitalized confirmed pneumonia not.

I would wait full study jumping conclusions. Reinfection thing scares corona. Always been.... numbers underreported... math trends dont work way Except situations, worker screamed paid per hour directly company, affected decision customer make. worries, I’m open it. 

It maybe. 3-4 day lead (to peak) progressively increased fatigue, two day lead brain fog, culminating one night faced mortality asked tough questions, like “am/was good man, done everything could wife small daughter”. 

I spent hours office Alexa playing “weightless” Marconi union repeat; remembered decreases stress levels ~60%, meditated, effort decrease amount oxygen body needed, since couldn’t control much getting. 

3-4 days gradual improvement, leading feeling physically great (full energy, mental clarity). days back normal like day. 

Maybe entire thing took place 7-10 days. don’t feel long term consequences, idea cellular level heart/brain went through. Could body recovered cost limited recovery future, way really know. 

The virus exist whether you’re afraid not; advice afraid it, 100% take precautions you’re able to.  on-line poll. basically worthless talking self-selected group. even getting side-effects (and consider fatigue side effect part illness). cry people make decisions head CDC said lies everything. last person listen anything Atlas, course he’s leading “expert”.  like that's salary lol. There's nowhere spend money people since working home nothing open.

Disposable income still working roof. else ya spend on? Stocks. quit spreading dumb ass fake news 

masks work trillion times better social distancing.

you could think you’re social distancing steady wind air conditioning unit could blowing virus right face

masks That's fatigue, that's dyspnea exertion shortness breath exertion. Fatigue generalized low energy. pork? wtf supposed tacos el pastor? Nice try. 112 degrees rate still holding steady day said going slow Florida due heat. 

The Middle East one spot. Perhaps thinking cities one affected by. 

Nobody expecting slow July August. point, call symptoms effects. side effects makes sound like related cure something. people far Fox News rabbit hole would never that. Access FOREIGN news not-America?!? friends outside this, free country earth? Heck, might lose citizenship treason like that! physically active able activities getting sick? Cringe. Someone clearly read Marx...

Regardless whether like live capitalist economic system work within reality. proletariat seized means production may point clearly haven't. you’re US chances slim none enter Christmas.

Most information available relevant country’s government webpage Two huge problems herd immunity. 

1) reach country pass period hospitals far beyond capacity people could survive dying.

2) proven cases re-infection covid19. might never possible without vaccine. Let people taze dick-nosers?

They'd cover *damn* quick.

I'm *recommending* this, mind saying immediate severe consequences wearing mask mouth guard chin strap, they'd wear properly. think largely make sure essential workers get vaccinated poorer countries. Making sure healthcare workers get vaccinated priority.

There's large problems keeping track vaccinations poorer areas world, problem vaccines require boosters. Hopefully 2nd generation vaccine that's single jab solve problem, least. 1st vaccines also little pricier side, Pfizer cheaper one around 18 dollars dose example, gets costly 3 billion people pop manufacturing fairy. cost without profits, vaccines shipping still going need funded. That's billions dollars even developed countries hard time paying pandemic reeking havoc economies. vaccines development also taking price consideration now; going fastest approved. thought low
But makes sense Maharashtra survey ( worst hit state) 12% pregnant women antibodies far.

We nowhere near peaking.extrapolating current data 10% now. First wave crests around 20% saw New York , Stockholm London even Delhi. Jesus it? It'll another 2 years lockdown easy.  basically they’re asking state something could easily won’t. 

Lead example. Jerks Plenty proof showing easy enough breathe mask on. law bust break wedding better waiting safe it? really worth it?

I can't think reason people postpone wedding except pure entitled selfishness.

I hope turn another super spreader event. Mouth breathers safe. Thank god mouth breathers safe. selfish ignorant pig grounds summary execution anywhere? Also since Trump fucking numbers. Covid March. Still battling fatigue well “unpleasant” gastrointestinal things. 
Wear mask. Third paragraph actually... ""Now we've passed grim milestone still losing around 1,000 people day, Donald Trump acknowledged—bragged—to Bob Woodward last winter knew COVID deadly airborne, many Trump-lovers starting look factual information virus""

What gain credibility reader? intent educate, turn away half readers purporting bullshit rhetoric. Clearly sensationalism probably therefore choc full speculation, half truths, conjecture aim weaking incumbent president ahead national election. Want educate? Put facts leave politics. Literally exact rules France Spain, really bad right now.

It’s really black white issue wonder Trump loves Florida much Someone’s big maaaaaad. honestly think sad happened Sweden, I'm baffled state denial many swedes seems in. could fail hard?  STUDY: many cups vegetables eat per week?

PARTICIPANT: 3?

STUDY: average American eats 3 cups vegetable per week. half u.s. wears like Well looks like COVID back menu boys! agrees im sure, hes making point worst possible scenario. reminds one coworkers keeps telling people ""wake up."" Mmm... ok, exactly, specifically? never seems answer -- guess I'm ready awake. Parklife! Poorly fitting masks. 

It take time everyone masks fit face properly. stupid thing could even come US.
but keep Turkey, kill people🤦🏻‍♂️ way posts worded based gets downvoted I'm really sure sick it. think people thrive it. Every post people living lives gets met ""selfish"" worse ""murders!"".

Go outside enjoy life. promise everything ok. Im totally side agree viewpoint im share, plays devils advocate crazies would say ""Trump anemy global elite get powerful country world back shadow government control would worth cost worldwide virus."" never lauded response umm news flash virus peaking “middle east” 60-70 degrees fahrenheit there. Check capitalism. seems running over. lot countries (or had) limited ability testing. Dead without tested counted covid19. truly don’t understand specific argument. virus isn’t real? Ok, explain fact United States 260,000 deaths far year typical? That’s quite pleasant coincidence mysterious “they” needed lie pandemic killing people, got magical excess deaths could attribute Covid.

Also, going away day election 192 countries world well. world leaders this? mean, couldn’t meeting decide everyone would known got together. set Zoom?

And exactly virus “fake” time China’s fault telling us bad was?

These people fucking potatoes. think end April? 

By April (ok, realistically July I’m say) goalposts “We understand vaccine everyone access vaccine, still need everyone stay home avoid anyone outside immediate household - vaccine effectiveness 70% still risk Americans”. first foremost Indian

Lmao r/canconfirmiamindian wild. self awareness all? think reporting facts political? article says Donald Trump acknowledged—bragged—to Bob Woodward last winter knew COVID deadly airborne...

and that's simply fact. Gee. careful. Chronic Lyme Disease becomes thing people vehemently defend despite evidence, lack thereof. assumptions motives politics far base, it’d funny weren’t obvious you’re terrified projecting fears. 

Real life costs money. political doesn’t exist country support people aren’t working. wish did, doesn’t. literally sacrificed mine families health everyday, conjugate care downstate ny. I’ve seen worst virus offer I’ve lost many people it. assumptions way base. live selfish capitalist culture country won’t shutting again.

My county worst outbreak state right now, ones slowing down. Lockdowns pipe dream going forward. Take precautions, protect yourself, you’re scared, stay away elderly, care. amount screaming internet going convince people give everything they’ve killed whole lives virus. They’d rather die. I’m sure theyd rather paid stay home, that’s going happen. don’t honestly think even can. ""*Currently, Miami-Dade, Broward counties South Florida locally imposed limits hours restaurants bars operate many customers serve ""indoors.* "" - NPR

&amp;#x200B;

This article misleading best. 

Fake news worst. Evidence anecdotal point time gone produce peer reviewed studies. It’s impossible know outcome present. know people experiencing issues lasting months. literally california texas. Spikes Midwest last region hit hard.

Beyond much country well. I'm glad someone caught that. Thousands estimated 9% covid positive cases US means chances long term side effects particularly high. talking 1/100th number long term side effects compared deaths. mean pretty much they’re worn properly. look barbershop one barbers sick cut hair whole day. coworker none customers contracted covid it. reason why? masks on.

if masks worn properly nose literally stop transmission. people infected home someone household goes public, gets sick, brings back home.

the problem restaurants bars. Active r/Conservative, say could possibly imagined industry built exploitation torture animals would exploit workers well! truly shocked! side effects honest. Caught recent. sports well mind selling tickets, $10 hotdogs $18 miller lites. (I trying generous numbers possible prove even worst case scenario isn’t going wipe generations) First positive news read weeks found father admitted hospital Covid Pneumonia. also 65 overweight. anyone point information common severe 2 combined. ventilator assume good sign apparently planning wait Pneumonia go away send home quarantine.  trying figure need fly home information combination would nice read. Thanks Bars closed mean people still socializing though? lmao

What think restrictions look like? Bars, theaters, live music venues, restaurants, things like salons closed limited, mask mandates - past several months that's I've seen. restriction place elsewhere in, say, Miami?

Sweden - articles like seem say differently, I'm going dig numbers. 

Once bringing Peru ignoring everything makes unique.

Florida Arizona lower population density NY -- yes, higher overall ""urban"" population that's outweighed massive NYC - again, also comparing apples oranges New York City got hit hard early time implement restrictions, mask mandates, etc.

Your Florida video - first, people TV I'm talking county city public health officials, whatever random talking head grab.

And Florida video - parts scanned - saying ""No restrictions, life normal!"" - experts seem calling smart, targeted restrictions. saying ""There's much prior immunity there's reason worry!"" fines, government intervention. place I've supermarket, see way many people without mask every time go. Businesses need start removing customers refuse wear mask. People soon get message keep getting thrown places NEED go to. Nail head.  “Not control yet” rarely reassuring sentiment. might remain first one never get second one They’ve done many things right still failing many fronts. It’s funny recent protest Nazis Antifa protesting cause (the masks) usually never happens, things really messed florida resident I'd happily pay 5% whatever average state income tax means overwhelmed Christmas enjoy holidays. I'd rather Christmas family presents bit cash. matter popular vote means literally nothing regardless. Factories co-opted federal government switch production badly needed supplies used (would take invocation Defense Production Act president).

There's guy factory set n95 masks. US. want get stuck load priced shit ...again. offered make masks start pandemic. Trumps government said no. fact, still agree purchase masks, sooooo want fix problem. one possibility necessarily likely.  Covid different things like flu seems damage major organs higher rate flu. might small amount, may repairable, may small amount damage. know things yet. Depending severity may put people risk group could killed second third strain. studies repeatedly said around 15%. weird thing number never increases. 15% two months least despite cases continually rising. live bubble. wouldn’t able spread virus around. But, but, but...*IF* there's gawd, create virus? Gate kept. really. Bread irrefutably things. would argue Bluezone innocent public health tool. question whether also used sinister government surveillance 100 DK recently lowered 50, got ton infections. 

I think Germany right 25 limit, least time going up. Previously number 16%. happened? finally fixed healthcare eliminating everyone needs it. cause everyone else's second wave. ...and also miss point entirely, looking cross-infection immunity, cross-infection antibody response lower peak viral loads reduce contagion. yeah viruses same. Flu, HIV, what's differene? viruses comparable! went airport recently food line one person mask nose another guy neck gaiter. Meanwhile wearing full respirator goggles. state-ordered ""capacity"" restrictions businesses lifted.  county city orders require masks social distancing, prohibit large gatherings, lifted.

Many people seem misunderstand. COVID pandemic over. 90% people (yet) disease, still communicable. everyone bring start kids dying? you?

Exponential decline numbers actually expected see imposed restrictions that's another reason suspicious Chinas numbers see exponential decay.

Growth always follows exponential function classical epidemiological models, regardless whether positive growth negative growth. R less 1 restrictions, still mathematically exponential, one decreases.

What saw February china far exponential decay. exponential all. near flat cut-off numbers someone high CCP decided ""ok, Coronavirus over, making us look bad"". Compare epidemiological curve Spain implemented similarly harsh lockdown. People even allowed exercise. There's smooth exponential decay daily case counts. 0.738% high number. mostly seing 0.6% 0.5% that.

0.738% population USA 2420640 people. 

So there's long way go. recent study saying new covid strain becoming resistant vaccines treatments sound optimistic wonder last line quoted text right significant. I've heard talking point children likely spread virus often thought true. Maybe true rather manipulated data. Shut air conditioning heating stay separate rooms. 6% mayor? mayor nyc?

No, he's good press, public opinion years. He’s hope karma you’re getting enough get kids good college. They’ll competing kids almost full year school. Hope sacrifice it. know true.

I'm tired stupid people.

I'm tired.  children fucked. 

I mean, even covid happened. ignorant people existed still exist after. Covid pressed every single weak point society made issues obvious heads sand previously. Got it. instead virus, terrorists killed 200,000 Americans year, it'd big deal you. Instead stopping terrorists killing Americans, need get grip. Education vitally important. viral risk kids nil. New Zealand's ""go early, go hard"" motto lead decison go ""flatten curve"" model elimination model ironically knew health care system lacking. weakness somehow lead success.



Public health experts said New Zealand could better prepared – example, better-funded health sector intensive care beds better systems place prepare disease outbreaks,” read. 1, cold flu season exists conditions weather makes viral transmissions easier 2. one virus play, complicated things “I cold/flu covid, go party” 3. people stay home due cold/flu, even get tested covid, impacting school reopening work force. basically trying save leg (restaurant industry) save head (professional work force plus school), makes sense.

French people almost never obese, diet vasty society's failings entirely fault individual?

It's either or. 

If society sucks offers crappy diet bad choices physical health. still choice follow stream eat junk people country, want something else.

CDC claims schools ""driver"" pandemic matter. 

Must nothing worry about. think half oblivious people half assholes wanting assholes. one ""parroting"" anything. sounds like thinking wearing nose conclusion drawn minimal research people properly wear masks.

some sources peruse really understand wearing mask CORRECTLY important.  Someone let Chuck Schumer know real tough time mother's. public all, stubborn determined. adjust repeatedly, finally removed inner filter would stop creeping badly.   pay attention every time use public bathroom. since started seen another man wash hands least 20 seconds. even pilots I've seen airports. found surrogate markers immunity. AFAIK reactive cells memory b cells. indicate may immunity sars-1. prove it. I'm curious read actual paper - word ""patients"" may imply hospitalization, obviously changes things. 

I'd also point main two symptoms mentioned article fatigue difficulty concentrating. know else causes things? depression anxiety large portion world feeling right now. Hard establish causation those.  TIL: People stupid want go, get test &amp; isolate get results. Cali, turnaround 2 days max clinics pay rapid tests give results 20 min. since work public setting, make sure pick KF94 masks Amazon ebay (they're Korean N95 equivalent). Chinese KN95's tested found lacking filtration. Well husband it, zero lingering symptoms 3 months, bloodwork done abnormalities. virus, takes time heal absolutely live fear say, years. Nope.

I'm sure what's difficult redditors understand. Yes, stupid absurdly obvious people it. easier breathe.  dad Canadian citizen. get in? I’m 35 ""Patients"" as-in people hospitalized (meaning serious cases) general sense people confirmed cases? Several factors affect participation African Americans studies identified including elements study design, logistical problems, low levels health literacy, sociocultural factors, specific attitudes hinder research participation. Mistrust academic research institutions investigators **the significant attitudinal barrier** research participation reported African Americans.

So see here, attitudes one wide, wide range identified causes low participation rates, mistrust highest barrier within attitudes. Mistrust includes causes, Tuskegee similar one element. nicely supports argument that, sure, effect, vastly overestimating size effect. 

Do disagree conclusion? so, why? Anyone else notice Labor OSHA hid closet, failing fulfill duties workforce? Surely there’s multi mega law firm class action this; Trump ordered meatpacking industry carry on. protect American’s access meat. Because, know, we’ll starve. economic decision went along held accountable. them, it’s money lose; workers lost lives -  mine yesterday like gas pump, prep pull correctly headed inside. make wonder people think ""it's ok, I'm near anybody right now'. Defiant compliance I've asked couple random people, either thought covid spreads mouth, ""rebelling."" act defiance. know 99% people won’t say anything, also know posses everyone off. usually tell people something get used to. Wearing shoes comfortable. certainly less comfortable socks slippers. get used kids. Sure, would nice muggy, sweaty, stinky feet. get used wearing shoes, protects feet prevents spread warts fungi.

I wear mask 16 hours day days. Yes uncomfortable. personally mind it, totally understand people struggle it. feel good face muggy condensation breath. Yes take time figure adjust straps press ears. week two, get used it. Masks going rose petals cheeks. get used shoes feet public, get used mask face.  Voting already underway starts soon--this reopening close enough election day GOP benefit image reopening full consequences another massive outbreak become apparent (after election day) Well that's terrifying literally excuse. blue/yellow medical masks everywhere. major retailers them. metal nose clip ensures fits anyone's adult face. walked Forever 21 free blue medical masks table needed one. nose either asshole choice ignorance thinking can't breathe (I seen older folks). Thanks reply, let's talk semantics. Even cells going mtutations. 1918 Flu virus mutated lethal form. caused second wave killed young people. third short sweet final burst. Covid mutated lethal form? No. Theres actual research saying like viruses, become less lethal. Hence second wave, we're seeing cases we've ramped testing capabilities. Maybe politically calling second wave makes sense still symptoms, recovered. It’s like putting condom balls. ...not gonna lie, day Fauci says anything *other* iteration “This Bad” I’ll probably die shock. 

And posthumously labeled Covid death. 😆 reason could think people covering nose breath putrid separate nose mouth. really need “experts” tell us this, seems like guys common sense would do. Well read certain medical masks eg N95 actually able stop Covid19 particles. 

Most masks people wear catch % presume maybe none. guess depends material. 

The main premise masks therefore protection others caused coughing, talking, sneezing. 

Since cough sneeze talk nose, think covering mouth likely desired effect protecting others. 

Someone wearing proper N95 mask mouth therefore protect others twtas wearing DIY cotton masks trying turn pandemic sort fashion accessory. 

Judging majority comments everyone parroting masks = good without done research. Anyone virtue signalling wearing N95 hypocritical twit.

However clear masks designed worn way automatically look kinda There's difference ""a plan"" looks good paper satisfies everyone involved initially, practically knowing able execute plan meaningful degree, I'm trying say Three words: Grand Prospect Hall. ""We make dreams come true!"" flying noticed everyone wearing masks airports (because to), including Dallas airport. Yet Dallas, probably 50% noses exposed. definitely political statement.

In view negligent governments businesses require masks let people this. treated wearing mask cases. *everyone brain That's way science works. want answer question ""which factors determine disease severity SARS-CoV2 infection?"" need come hypothesis design experiment test it. case virus can't challenge experiments rely observational studies animal models, keeping mind limitations. want say infectious dose impact disease severity, provide evidence. one making claim, me. Yeah, that's mind-numbing. brother intentionally ""stick man"". He's anti-masker. Makes want slap him. experience people need masks rule breakers. last person saw arguing shopkeeper covering nose, claimed asthma breathe properly on. absolutely massive enough stop every five feet get breath mask that's problem... may end true, heard official announcement yet. fact remains Apple loses money every day new phone market leading Christmas. delay political reasons. one example real-world impact nothing ""November 4th"" US politics. virus real, hoax hurt Trump's reelection chances. Anyone says must realize rest world exists. AKA, much family neighbors. want really want wear one Real question though: masks nose work mouth breathers? parties right anyway lol

Obligatory reminder Vote Protest safety. Yeah do. obviously good surgical mask, provide least type barrier coughing, sneezing, airborne particles.

According someone coughs 18 inches wearing face shield, immediate viral exposure reduced 96%. person remains coughing talking 30 minutes, face shield blocks 68% small air particles.

The glasses fog really annoying disruptive. Obviously excuse wear mask, certainly explanation actual wearing mask disruptive may prohibitive people. Give sort break!!! driving us batty one way another!! Yeah, caught virus prevents feeling irrational fear. Right. It’s worth time looking confrontation. That’s point. wear mask to, since don’t agree concept forced mask wearing, pull nose.

If expert they're quoting referring transmission yeah pretty much like wearing all, terms transmission others definitely better nothing. see anything article study cited stating otherwise.

Again I'm covering nose mouth. yet somehow discussion risks always leads kids, teachers. dishonest. think people realize breath stinks want smell breath.

Sometimes eat go out. pizza breath swirling inside mask pleasant.  choice really... Nice. also insane flu shot drives every single year country would much much worse didn't. things like need explained?# dumb ass dick nosing idiots Plus learning good study skills (from me)

People fucking dense. started wearing mask early February people looked funny. asthma panic disorder mildly uncomfortable makes breathing feel weird, know what? COVID19 makes breathing whole lot worse. Again, people fucking stupid. Wouldn’t stand reason mask nose would effective currently proper way wear them? Surely mouth coverage important, yes?

Note - wear mask appropriately. ...but bet wouldn’t shit someone wear neck bandana store, even though absolutely nothing even fully covering face.

I’d buy deals small orders :-/ yeah debated whether appropriate decided humor wins case right, kindness key. Maybe came bit harsh, looking straight mirror gonna hurt anyone.

We're health crisis everyone makes choice workout 4 times week, yoga, meditate, eat healthy. everyone still lining McDonald's, waiting vaccine save them. said regard official statistics....you cite excess deaths....can't ways now. 

Also understand trying argue. UK shit show, USA worse. Good lord. skeptics going full ""civilian Third Reich"" shrugging shoulders allowing mass death now? Well, that's fucking terrifying stupidity happens literally contagious. Funny, thought health policy better suited government leaders retail stores. Completely arguments desperately trying turn tides. ""No, see, opponent *unreasonable*, even explain it..."". countered every point, running away.

""Ministerial governance"" complete nonsense, person using platitude honest. never issue. Answer question instead. part ""ministerial governance"" says Swedish government can't start building stockpiles, start manufacturing, recommend masks close borders? complete rubbish!

People like business carrying normal life. Yeah... I'm pretty darn paranoid careful, I'd happy watch game sit outdoor stadium roughly 100 seats myself. Well terrible piece shit. air go lungs time impossible, also semi-common misconception trying correct (joke not). According every resource find, that's absolutely circular breathing is, including limited Wikipedia: skill breathing nose breathing orally time

That strictly speaking mean anything different said. clarify precisely meant would happy address People chipmunks.

Well course not, way around - chipmunks people. say hard breathe wear properly. flu shot prevents/greatly mitigates influenza symptoms, protects people well yourself. 

If anything, important ever get flu shot year. Well duh say. downvoted true? There’s life drinking getting laid... article says letter concerned needing two months second dose. presumably October report would come two months second dose passed.

EDIT: read letter. Participants yet received dose two. majority people still complying, bullshit narrative. way worse rioting thousands. 

Anyone nose executed front whitehouse. Bruh, amount people wash hands taking shit, full well knowing there's others bathroom alarming. imagine closeted no-washers can. care.

Person disabilities amongst shit lungs here, mask puts verge passing walking got wrong one. want widespread flimsy cotton ones suck vacuum nostrils every breath.

If kind risk group even important wear damn mask safety anyway. answer 40% drop cancer (a disease kills 600k people year US *in perpetuity*) research/funding imply worth fight pandemic (which way, always end), I'm sure tell you. got tunnel vision. 

Of course resources spent virus, whole ""just take much want away everything else"" thing shortsighted illogical.  Nothing? Like every respiratory viral pandemic know burns 12-18 months, vaccine vaccine, becomes endemic disappears completely.

Oh economy destroyed lockdowns, COVID19. Exactly; lose four square feet bathroom gain lot convenience everyone.   prove otherwise? spouse following coronavirus guidelines strictly. inside anyone else's home since March, one inside apartment. socializing fully outdoors physical distancing, diligent mask usage.

My mother (over 60 yrs old) lives across country wants visit Christmas. typically stays us visits. 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment though. There's really way separated isolated.

At moment still feel like unsafe us stayed place flying (unless 14 day quarantine airbnb hotel something). wrong this, current guidelines basically suggest anyone stay you? Right I've able find articles May June advising people guests stay unless separate areas.

Taking one step further, let's say stays airbnb hotel. Would also unsafe drive car since six feet apart could potentially inhaling other's breath particles?

Any articles, studies, links, etc. appreciated.  Okay, say you’re small business owner successful dry cleaner Upper West Side, employees making slightly minimum wage. Rent creeping up, steady volume white collar professionals dropping shirts suits made it.

It’s easy bail dry cleaner’s employees. problem dry cleaning business easy. It’s sudden drop demand promise ever returning pre-pandemic levels.

If applied 2nd highest post sub right that's full anti-vax rhetoric basis hating current administration. That’s largely cloth masks do, (but slightly better face shield alone). Try sneezing cloth mask, going come sides/top/bottom.  would harder sneeze arm/elbow wearing face shield, though. Short term ploy make people feel like over, everything normal, help Trump polls. lag, deaths spike election over. TIL fascism discouraging obesity. rates disgusting. countries dealt virus gods lol?

Behold living god , prime minister New Zeeland. People still going flee city avoid commute working home, lockdown lockdown.  Waves comes back down. baby going like crypto stock market, Fibonacci numbers! (Fun fact think? get complete data, think able see it). 3,000 deaths day months end ungodly human cost. hope correct hospitals handle influx patients, I'm confident that. fact infections spread country may make matters even worse, stretch resources even more. Dense epidemics coasts, heartland seems like nightmare scenario me. We'll see happens. Dems voted returning military budget one two years ago. 

They speak policies party for, support them. Where’s corona relief bills pelosi promised March? April? may? passed pubs wanted wasn’t single bargaining chip table. even slightly point. Hang friends want. hanging family, risking entire support network one meal. That's insanely risky. Ok, got it. We're going get herd immunity 2% population contacted virus, time, numbers also wildly exaggerated. simultaneously far less 2% population virus that's still enough herd immunity.

And also fact vast majority republicans refuse take vaccine sort tracking microchip bill gates. Also, vaccine currently, take months make 200 million+ vaccines required herd immunity even one. 

How work? understand math. anyone believe this? Downtown Tampa superspreader event since lightning stanley cup. dumbass cousins thousands others hugging eachother screaming totally maskless You’d hope so, yet Tuskegee forgotten. ^^^^^no ^^^^no ^^^no ^^no^^no^noNOOOOO hate shots passion. I'm grown adult look away. got shot already. kinda hurt I'm baby. free I've experience zero side effects except flu. Nobody ever gives death numbers %. Like wars such.

So, that's already norm. instance making big kids getting behind comparison themselves. talk time adaptable kids are. we're acting like generation kids graduate high school 19 20 far worse society generation disabled permanently Covid. absurd. 

We've already stripped much 18 year old's privileges, going end society people graduate high school 18. would huge burden pay permanent heart, lung, brain damage though. Yeah that’s problem America especially reddit. doubt it’s Macron virus France. meteor hit us all. either lock everyone inside vaccine collapse economy. make smart decisions reopening. Adjusting population France put 77k cases day. America’s peak 79k. K, well there's reasonable chance good percentage family get sick. Congrats!

Yea dude people respecting state quarantine shit either. think end world everyone vacationing wtf. Quarantining staying elderly relatives house northeast!!! We're still going first wave. 1. Heart attacks fellow Polk County resident, makes sad.  Westchester NY 2.39% Exactly, never happens, that's got SARS vaccine summer, right? exactly. states balanced budget mandates written state constitutions bunch states nearly went bankrupt financing construction railroads 1800's. Lol neck gaiters actually make risker everyone else thumbnail... I've talking month one listen. People thought crazy showing huge third (or second) wave coming everyone dismissed alarmist. also altered hospital’s research agenda. human papillomavirus vaccine, prevent cervical cancer, became available, researchers proposed approaching local school principals enlisting black teenage girls research Mrs. Obama stopped that. prospect white doctors performing trial black teenage girls summoned specter Tuskegee syphilis experiment mid-20th century, white doctors let hundreds black men go untreated study disease.

One would want specifics forming firm view, sounds like perfectly reasonable call. No. Officials predicting 2-3m nothing, actually predicted 40-80k social distancing quarantine... kinda shot mark huh  red scare back worse ever Yeah it’s really sad everyone says it’s trump’s fault end. would help people didn’t make make choice going completely bankrupt losing putting country risk people wouldn’t forced risk everything.

Ahh, was. Reddit pseudointellectualism 5 points 3 months ago* 
Dude really talking stuff clinical education whatsoever.

The studies tiny finding association Vit deficiency poor outcomes absurdly low Vit levels threshold deficiency.

Further really person tell people take 5000 IU Vit especially worked up. dozens dozens conditions put people high risk complications get even higher levels Ca PO4 already have. Telling someone sarcoidosis ""you take Vitamin D"" even know sarcoidosis seriously dangerous.

Kidney problems, Diabetes insipidus, hyperparathyroidism plenty conditions highly exacerbated unnecessary Vitamin supplementation. Let doctors determine they're patients need supplementation. telling everyone take Vitamin dangerous. understand distrust, understand logic.

There long history using people color unwitting unwilling participants sorts medical testing.

What prove medical industry American government stopped them? New laws? Oaths? stopped before.

It seem silly you, I, that's we, families may completely different experience they've had.  squares make circle, squares make circle, 
Why squares make circle, I’m happy live Florida. Lockdowns essentially nonexistent since beginning. Life same.

Downvote you’d like. I’m RN covid unit hospital. I’ve cared hundreds people covid. doesn’t concern me. must terrifying someone who’s opinion covid based solely news social media.

People would rather live lives take chance virus survival rate 99.8% live locked homes threatened poverty mental illness.

You’ve saying “2 weeks!” since beginning. surge never happened. little busy July. haven’t seen positive covid case 3 weeks. feel sorry everyone who’s locked repeatedly fed bullshit day day, week week. antithesis thoughtless sheppard like Twitter ratio come life. Everything essential better days / weeks Fascist. anybody remember Fifth Element?

In movie evil character Zorg speech Chaos Destruction breeds purpose, jobs, money, simulating fact breaking glass host robots clean up.

In scene, counter argument takes one thing gum whole profit-from-destruction thing - case cherry Zorg accidentally consumes begins choke on.

It's satisfactory little moment movie turns incredibly naive taken analogy reality trying be. reality, movie's analogy would one mean put eggs one basket hopes fixes everything, case ""cherry"" Cornelius eventually helps Zorg choking death on.

The reality destruction profitable. Sick people pay insurance companies, debt consolidators, collections agencies. Asymptomatic people spend money public businesses. Scared people stay home spend money in-home entertainment usual paying debts, profitable debt-holders.

We hoping Covid would cherry gummed whole profit-from-destruction cycle we'd able feel good right end part fix things, turned Covid destruction lined pockets cherry gummed system all. 

That's we're pretending over. broken glass worth people fear choking death cherry. incredibly sad. Miami beautiful. Don’t lump us panhandle Florida's economy literally depends bars, think late save place. weekly cycle fewest cases week tend run Mondays. absolutely serious. neglect body *that* much part blame, it, placed you. (for severity symptoms) sad frustrating read. Good post, thank you. projection Canadian deaths along 10M deaths curve? (ie. 0.6 IFR 1.5 R0) way standard African countries. Firstly, produce similar symptoms similar damage organs. double-whammy, will, even healthiest among us would hard-pressed fight home bed rest soup.

Second, much northern hemisphere obeying simple, straightforward advice (or, indeed, places actual rules) led similar record-low levels. levels low people supposed distance, wear masks, stay home unless travel truly necessary, wash hands frequently, eat healthy foods rest. 

If noticed great many places US, example, things done well fear see dramatic drop flu cases. Comes this:  im moving south florida honestly dont feel like people blamed. many people dont believe participating. sure antimaskers whatnot people I've seen pretty cautious. governor one blame. even mayors miami fort lauderdale think hes idiot. mayor miami said something along line ""the governor anything trump does"" someone screen name like thee***vagabond***, I'd guess opposite. Idk live big city huge portion country absolutely carrying like nothing happening.. ""the rich stop fucking us.""

Well, stop offering backside every slightly technological advancement comes along. rich can't fuck prostitute like crack whore addicted every comfortable, stylish, state art, bobble-art see. 

I guess people like simply think innovators, scientists, artists serve feeble-minded needs sense responsibility. Hey, great feed pigeons watch coo bob heads unison, reason exist. 

I'm unsatisfied standard living, criticize others theirs. However, think deserve something gifted enough create yourself. Drop jealousy. *avoids eye contact American* already stole like trillions first stimulus. people haven’t worked since March 7th. choice work try pay bills. wanted show guns. well hey least 12 like headline could suggest Funny mean  What's comparison 9/11? Pearl Harbor attack referenced way mass fatality incidents?

At least Indian Ocean tsunami used measurement soon. point think genuine stupidity magical thinking. think *really* take threat seriously should. mashup believing economy shutdown kill people COVID-19, thinking herd immunity thing best, thinking fine anyone 60, etc. Australians, downvotes upvotes! Even they're 3000 hospitals handle load, presuming virus equally spread across country. another NYC like scenario freezer morgues parked street. part over. 

Life go matter what. Right? Always suggesting people leave that’s it. mention leases, rent, family, obligations, moving costs, etc. Don’t forget 24/7 social surveillance tells go when. healthiest mode probably somewhere ""terrified leave house"" ""let's pack bars"". one forcing customer in, employees forced in. Even offices running fine work-from-home insisting people come back office. shit ridiculous. live:

Listen feel ya, Trump don’t mean shit me. know every human life experiences. would never question someone’s belief especially someone coming military. 

This projecting man. Though don’t support trump, don’t fall Trump Evil narrative shoved throats every single day. 

I don’t trust MSM...CNN FOX. 

I genuinely want people think theirselves listen propaganda face planted faces. 

I wish health wealth life brotha...my initial comment irritation. years since worked situation like remember Christmas sales. stores like mosh pits. push way help anyone. Got mine last week. 42 years rock one nasty reaction flu shot made ill day.

I've flu fucked six ways Sunday week.

I'll take shot time. Florida wild west USA Yeah I'm Canada too. province, cities zones. US least counties. drawing dire financial situation made things worse fronts, whereas they'd locked hard like one two months rent freeze, yeah, would've sucked, would mostly (or least control) now. share data, research prove otherwise? Where’d earn PhD? conversely sub extreme, persistent pessimism Prove it.

Don’t need to. Ozarks, Sturgis, Protests, everyone seen tens thousands cases traced outdoor events. one two things detail test methodology reported quoted yet others literally making sample questions fabricating theories conclusions camouflaged science speak push conservative misinformation narrative test untrustworthy covid isn’t bad. Cool story.

“Kim Shin-woo, professor internal medicine Kyungpook National University School Medicine Daegu, sought comments 5,762 recovered patients South Korea 16.7% participated survey, said Kwon.” Glasses Even cause problems, going pay pump often. Whenever see someone like immediately assume they're mouth breather. logical explanation Wrong Florida--that state disaster that's getting worse reopening Sorry - worded wrong. False mask wearing depletes oxygen. start violently coughing right next them. Like walk pull mask start coughing. Usually keeps inbredness away me. Like said, freeze 78. really feel like people enjoy north understand people freeze easily. MISERABLE/constantly angry cold hurts body much. lived Atlanta, Nashville, Salt Lake City, Seattle. 11 years altogether experience wintery places seasons. hate snow traditional winter stuff like sweaters, dark colors, hygge... feel magic--all feel physical pain goddamn cold.

I met tons people north politically blue much happier hate cold. probably involved groups.  Florida decided open theme parks. 

They also decided positivity rate 10 percent big deal.

They also decided 100+ deaths day big deal. 

California Florida. experts also said masks didn’t work one time. said experts said didn’t. you’re fucking dope it’s obvious it’s half effective, it’s still blocking one port entry lungs... tested oxygen levels regularly prior covid? Someone told it’s “disrespectful show mouth you’re talking someone”. wear mask store pull talk cashier! Unbelievable false, I'm fat fuck really hard breathe working would insult Texas ""can't breathe"" take satisfaction circumventing around mask mandate. know proper way wear it... mean, point not... could leadership stops pretending ok wear mask. people part would end sooner. people call hoax, exxagerated overlapping people refuse bear minimum.  agree extent claim restaurants necessary, cruise ships, things, might well consistent call monster trucks necessary well. Average American family spends something like $4,000 year restaurants, blows mind. Save it. Cook home. like 1/10 price.  looks like lot people going need heart lung care, right. Yea one making money ICU either. even broader understanding nuance seem giving nuances weight. 

Pretending economy important people missing point people economy. 

Also facts countries paying population stay home safe. can't blame local governments trying make shit sandwich trump corruption palatable constituents. Even means losing jobs, easier medical bankruptcy, lifelong illness, death. might end cases due opportunities virus spread, liberal areas may try localized lockdowns. death rate never bad spring. Places like AZ hit harder summer (which like practical winter pushing people indoors), example could go. brought cases back without totally locking back down. Yeah. think diagnostic development faces issues clinical trials bias towards white men baseline. Like know effectively treating someone baseline measurements accurate them? can't.  masks ffs  see many people daily thought “alone” bathroom?? morons still comparing influenza flu? guys single cell working brain meth corroded away? Yes, realized mistake. mom lung cancer good portion lobe removed, dad still smokes. fair poorly get covid everything to. set instacart never go out. point still stands. disposal likey, get touch package virus forget wash hands. evidence 12 year olds use internet unsupervised American thing? addition horrible things humans nature. gotta tell brother law seem well-informed bathroom activities people know. fault, seem exactly stupid I'm pretty shape, wearing work sucks, end day gets hard breath, letting schonze helps ""It airborne."" -China, February/March.  Duh. saw one idiot wear mask nose pull mask speak clerk. even bother. SMH mask properly on. didn’t specifically criticize anything make quantifiable assertions, said Americans “are laughing stock world” believe “[we] number one.” constantly repeated rhetoric... mean, I’m sure expect respond childish *quotes.* Elderly, poor, people color, seem affected. think really mind little collateral damage either. So...how many people think forcibly confined homes China, think worth given major economy set post GDP growth 2020?

Things going pretty well huh? ask current infection death rates COVID-19 neck woods, country's GDP performed second quarter 2020? Hopefully yes, almost certainly no. Don’t know subs people like comment in. keeps stupid centralized helps stop spreading educated communities. Also, 2018, UNAIDS reported estimated 770,000 people died HIV worldwide. 2004, 1.95 million. Average age death around 50 years old. korea. I’d say least half people wear masks nose.  women's bathroom, monthly stuff goes bin towels.... Would lucky little brown bag. Sure. like speeding, rioting, vandalism, theft. enforced fines consequences. You’ve got breathing problem? I’ve got life threatening asthma, wear mask 24 hours day hospitalized asthma flare, wear mask half hour grocery store.

Edit: person wearing mask right Besides covid lockdown, blm/antifa riots help either. Let's hope hardest period behind us.  name cancers caused COVID19 another figment imagination?

What's survival rate 50 year old colon cancer without treatment, versus 50 year old COVID19? brain doesn’t work properly. Well R0 4.0 sure impacts analysis. also need explain current rise cases Europe suggesting Europe achieved herd immunity first wave. doesn’t add up.  facetious, irony funny. knows, maybe cure kind cancer would come 40% reduction.

Every virus ""novel"" depending frame reference. know threat coronavirus drop bucket compared major conditions persist kill people *every single year.* people know use feet flush people don’t wash hands. surprise? wish natural selection take away idiots, endangering others 250k Americans dead thanksgiving, waaaaay citizens countries yeah, everyone here's exaggerating serious things Yup. logic, fart particles also carry 2km away right conditions, mean people block going smell it.  Totally wrong.

In Europe, outdoor barbecues summer source outbreaks.

And outdoor event kicked pandemic UK, Cheltenham Festival. 150,000 attendees! Again, surge cases locally event.

How much proof need? Nah, toddler wears mask appropriately covering mouth nose. leave figure out. Umm, US distribution could start november. Wow leave area mask supposed protect doesn’t work, shocker.

That’s like sex condom broken tip, fuck expect, new car?! would _love_ leave, dirt poor immune compromised. theres Young people catching recovering covid good thing. 99.9998 percent time fine possibly vectors transmission anymore. Young people worse odds flu. mean real flu, cold people get claim flu. No. parents part age cohort makes 20% deaths.

Im assuming parents I. 64-75 age group estimated 1.3% 4.2%. likely overestimate study (dated 9/26/20) relied seroprevalence shown inherently limited.

Regardless. parents chances dying, else equal, would somewhere 1 25 1 100.

People risk groups consider stringent forms quarantine risk. say was. comment replying another refrain ""it would easy wait normalcy!"" suggestion see time. places, NYC sacrificed normalcy longest, close managing virus get if/when vaccine arrives. weddings normal gatherings avoided *forever* (if vaccine), say so, rather saying *little"" patience heap shame you. Men PC faring better expected Covid infection, testosterone whole story. Alyssa Milano. hair fell Call optimist... think we'll several vaccines approved getting distributed mid next year. would great. candidates right probably work out. that's fine. Covid-45 will. falls first group. Perhaps subcategory? Take upvote. gigantic asteroid could heading towards us year wouldnt 1 hour impact UN actually come together stop it.

bureaucracy cancer work together 100s countries, things go slow since every country wants *this* wants *that* 

Its every country themself definitely see richer countries join WHO's vaccination initiative. go know. wouldn’t risk spreading someone else even mean lol. think would come cure cancer covid happening? Unless get covid control people die long canxer/heart disease get them. cancer/heart disease dont shut entire world sound touch reality. Leave mother's basement occasionally get job. Masks dont work ur gay Pretty common sense really. someone CHF, dialysis renal kidney issues gets covid virus exacerbates underlying problem person would died acute CHF due covid infection. normally died CHF time virus infection......they die. Florida trade lives floridians Disney dollars day week. Apparently California wont.  I've experience. use medical tape (like 2 inches it) seal top mask prevent air going way. put tape morning, another one lunch. find helps lot glasses. know someone annoy people Sheep drive location every day. polite, I'm better person are. going right post truth path like Trump Co did. White House says COVID gone Easter 2020. often overlooked step. love open doorways bathroom doors bodycheck leave. Yes mask mandates violence, mandates point gun, threat jail loss liberty. Fucking duh. couldn’t pay go Disney World restrictions lifted Florida. social distancing mask wearing. Plus little kids running around touching everything sight. thanks. Lol shitshow. It’s virus doesn’t exist anywhere Florida. Sorry, know wrong. simple fix like said, I've fog free ever since. Maybe live somewhere much humid me? crazy thing people think honest themselves. People tell us can't time. parents, spouses, jobs, church, etc. LMAO - COVID-19 restriction policies working neck woods? ...and status global pandemic? point, FYI. There's reason believe 8 cases end NFL. large sample size time, correct. outliers don’t change trajectory statement. would expect things equal population actively sabotaging health would worse lifespan prospects take precautions time. Sure take precautions die different reasons rate trying die end dying ensure elimination population permanently sustainable. There's talk localized lockdowns starting issue $1000 fines unmasked public. hope latter city could use money neighborhood full inconsiderate fucks. see also: Puerto Ricans (US citizens) birth control 👍🏻 don’t care. Yes, Numbers One Two US density: NJ RI. Deaths/pop: NJ Number One; Little Rhody 5th recently dropped 6th. 

I’m RI; scary. great Governor, it’s still scary thanks partying Providence College, numbers ticking 😷 think it’s they’re told “have wear one” either legally enter stores. don’t actually believe importance masking they’re morons loophole. Yup. checked teens get this, see they've become infertile? Probably not. maybe 20 years try kids can't comes back 90% infertile 35 year olds also covid. told mom get stressed work (retail) people covering noses. said can't believe everything news says. dumbfounded respond. war poverty war poors anything accelerated Good know mean, tf breath. everyone bunch mouth breathers. would need to? vast majority readers infer information 1-0 = division champs!!! it? ""suggest"" all? see how. doubt anything appear safer comply mandates, lets honest here, still risky. Sometimes I’ll primp mirror seconds wait someone else open door slip behind them.

Obviously, works sometimes. Might start carrying emergency paper towel. mean, Covid already producing generation people carry gloves hand sanitizer everywhere; might well. family refer dick nose. pointless wearing underwear low dick hanging out. I'm glad picked finally start therapy boy gonna need it. real thing glasses fogging, there's real excuse. know 25k lost job Disneyland 250k lost lives, seems 10 1 Perhaps schnoz long. store saw man let’s say rather large nose could definitely tell mask wore would uncomfortable probably. masks shaped differently accommodate larger noses. it’s excuse search them. undernoses people chastise someone wearing mask all. work little desk. work security apartment building 6 feet away people coming in. get patrols put inside building course. work 12-14 hour shifts. wearing mask long gets pretty annoying. Again, I'm desk wear it.  clever way get people hate lockdowns instead wealth inequality. Yeah, patrol. mainly civil enforcement full peace officer powers take action witness crime, see traffic infraction, someone flags down, etc.   across parks business units, specify numbers beyond that. person exposed Saturday, took physical test within next morning Sunday.....and positive result comes Tuesday. means two things:

Either virus works fast/aggressively infecting someone enough test positive 24 hours possibly exposed Saturday.

I'm trying figure which. co-worker tested positive. claim got exposed Saturday, I'm buying it. Wow, obvious 🤦🏻‍♂️ wash hands deed? makes sense also. never see people that. saw it. MiL believes wearing nose causes carbon dioxide stay inside suffocate her.

She master’s degree. not. Norway Finland much better Sweden.

About 2/3 population need infected herd immunity. Sweden somewhere around wasting life invested propaganda.

You're watching Fox News.

Also, propaganda what? spread via droplets. Masks catch droplets. use knowledge reduce spread rate. average infected person infects less 1 person, numbers go down. simple.  ""view everything year-long slice"" assumption poisoned whole discussion attempt contextualize danger compared dangers society. 200,000 people died American roads since 2014, representing many many life years lost covid. another 200,000 die next 6 years, continue cry bloody murder every reduction speed limit, every speed camera, every lane becomes rededicated transit. Recovery could mean virus detected. Florida, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai Disneylands re-opened. suggests Disney knows reopen theme park middle covid, keeping people safe. California holding things up? cruelty, corruption, selfishness, greed, deceit ideals expected. Okay, wrote long thing, got deleted posted it. let’s make short simple.

No stages vaccine development skipped. outright lie. Phase 2 isn’t skipped move onto Phase 3 testing. 

What occurring, later stages (past phase 3 clinical trials) allowed start, phase 3 trials completed. 

The best example good thing situation manufacturing. Usually, manufacturing would require phase 3 trials completed FDA approval begins. Instead, now, manufacturing beginning early, allowing potential vaccines built up, so, case one ends getting approved, shipped immediately en masse, without build manufacturing immediately, produce approved. allows vaccine(s) much rapidly deployed distributed vaccine becomes approved FDA.

Hopefully, see, isn’t political issue all. isn’t moral issue. definitely nothing with, way violation Nuremberg Code. Americants follow direction Great keep kids school. kinds special world unfortunately. know /s indicates? dates study 1932-1972 never told time syphilis. 25 years treatment available, allowed develop late stage syphilis. Even heard penicillin syphilis, know applied them. ""treated"" essentially ineffective dangerous meds likely treated skin symptoms curative impact disease course. think Wikipedia article means treatment. Sadly lot people still mentality focusing cleaning rather social distancing/ wearing face masks. could come fact governments also focused first...   Depends schools. High schools colleges lead major outbreak Wisconsin. weeks ago percentage cases 18 24 year olds high dropped. case count per day remains older age brackets rising cases. Honestly think we'll ever know much kids spread actually test classroom kids look virus room test it. done yet? Also often going test younger kids symtoms? almost never could still spread it. Sweden anomalous culturally US. many cases comparable experience US report Friday Monday Tuesday, catch up. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

Edit: also yeah hair regrowth look stupid lol, happy see it. People want virtue signal reason feel superior others. They're interested facts. That's standard practice? *real* gentle though. quite common viral infections. It’s immune system really high stress. get back normal, I.e. regrow, time. Theres number 3 that. People know spread disease actively want getting people sick gives feeling empowerment. That’s beside point /s dont need ""experts"" tell this. get point. general: Germany much liberal right comes attendance commercial football; think limit 500 Sweden's arenas going biggest problem; problem private parties workplaces, almost everywhere ...  encourage people wear [3D They're comfortable ensures nose mouth covered. Haha headline crazy time sure well received around here. heard people microdosing psychedelics helped immensely long-term smell taste issues. 

Psychedelics like psilocybin well known promote neurogenesis well structural functional neural plasticity.  basically extension lockdown ability declare lockdown without bureaucracy involved? see lot admittedly less people around first wear masks. learned fucking much wearing tube bandanna style mask makes sweat work . Like face sure figured like triggers body sweat. sucks I’d rather safe. sneezing competitions. mask, plastic bag. air left mask negligible. state FL relaxed pretty much restrictions, yesterday, green light Disney (for better worse). Local government still restrictions, think enforceable (by fining Good news also reminds another simulation based study months ago spread particles outdoors runners cyclists I'm sure debunked. Much better wallow misery guess ? Libs that. Trump that. Either way, article virus, politics. Simply accusing 2/3 nation tossing science absurd.

That's much ask"" germans arent bad Going outdoor activity two people close go recommendations. I'm relieved already know long-term effects... why? Oh yeah, excellent point. Since doubt first time expressed views, I'm impressed succinctness writing, time took note statistics. Thank you- USA lower death rate though. even agreed you, still wrong.

When USA reported 60k dead, already actually passed 200k USA 3 million current cases Corona. 3% die another 90,000 deaths. fact pandemic still active means continue lower usual numbers since people get infected dying, creates data delay. 

No matter way cut, USA failed demonstrably worse countries every way. data meant used; service humanity. Surveillance data tools; like tool, abused. fear abused good enough reason use positive benefits.

If ever scenario highlighted surveillance big data yield positive results people, it.

The results speak themselves. Pick social psychology textbooks local library. explain great detail simple language (social psychology first/second year course, sciency language kept minimum) They’ll figure two weeks so... Well fantastic news hear, oldest brother Florida working... fact actively still believes ""just cold"" fully expect hear himing catching COVID-19 next couple months now. second wave 1918 Spanish Flu mutation... saying coronavirus mutated? telegraphed ""second wave"" result us testing people? Well, first year psychology student could give explanation this: coping mechanism. People stress try cope various ways. Drugs (and general addictive substances, habits like) one coping mechanisms people choose. one easy low effort. Take away need coping mechanism lot (not all, though) goes away. doctor never arrested. warned police returned work.

disgraceful Well done. got hit huge surge, managed get back control. Proof done. can't record music remotely can't shoot music videos remotely friends. Two important hobbies me. Vermont rural large urban centers Well, fair, Jell-O shots going slurp themselves- got back Italy weeks ago.

Compulsory face mask orders anytime public unless seated outdoor restaurant. Hand gel going store.

It's simple, really. Almost like masks social distancing actually works.  Groundbreaking= one died feline leukemia... Fox news: Condom prevent pregnancy, boogeyman hiding bed does.  live USA started house people kept clogging toilet, plus got bidet installed. insulting players it’s absurd think people worst I’ve never done question conclusion. 

If folks breathing thru mouths nose aren’t technically protecting others? Isn’t really wearing mask peoples perspective own? chuckled, funny think there's much data transmission indoor arenas, rather seating, I'd worried lines concession stands, bathrooms, crowds everyone leaves once. sounds like they're addressing one those. course, even assumes pre-ordering works smoothly. gets backed up, still going lines. Correct. like sagging jeans butt hanging out. expect infections jail then. you’re apart it. Damn, lost pool, betting Miami. California shut covid caught minnie drinking soda straw? Unfortunately happens countries too, like Switzerland. work pizza shop university. Customers need wear mask come inside, can’t tell many times I’ve customer pull mask order. Like what? Yeah hair fell due Iron Deficiency, anemic though. Hair grow back iron status sufficient took extremely long time.

I fully depleted. u/queenrowana u/bond4141 Nixon. people hair/nail issues contexts, biotin supplement often suggested. personally use gummy ones (""Hair Skin Nails Gummies"") get Target, ones typically help taken consistently. show effects least 2 months nails, probably longer hair, unfortunately.

Obviously, contexts advised (e.g., kidney issues). positive results people hospital. Greatly reduced symptoms strengthens immunity patients lower immunity virus. Hah! face! Thicktwat-itis us common fold. Outside, doesn’t fog sunglasses. I’m anywhere near people immediately pull up. Inside, take sunglasses mask up. Relevant moment, Reagan's foot dragging HIV/AIDS destroyed trust. Fauci deeply involved HIV+government learned lessons. can't wear mask, understandable, going without one endangering others not. Many overweight people wear masks without issue, actually athletes train. problems breathing, around people rn. I.E. crowded stores workplaces.  fucking shit world Murica. think read somewhere willing base playoff standings win percentage instead record case teams miss game.

Somewhere, Bill Belichick scheming. Florida? FDA: vaccine 
Exploratory stage,
Pre-clinical stage,
Clinical development (phase I, II, III),
Regulatory review approval,
Manufacturing,
Quality control.

Tell stage safe skip. move phase III clinical trial finish phase II end putting vulnerable people danger data vaccine drug behaves less risk. part clinical trial ethical regulations since like, based headline, droplets aerosols come nose. Accordingly, need cover noses. Sweet. make eating work much safer. Keep mind beat economy

The virus that, economy balls killed 200k far

And keep going round round round equivalent ferocity. Look Sweden. always big advocate wearing masks since beginning advise anyone wear wear correctly. “research” doesn’t make sense, COVID mostly transmitted small particles saliva talking coughing far know isn’t saliva nose. everybody covers mouths already huge step right direction. I’m assuming losses California? looking source bring start kids dying single treatment vaccine produced mass quantities deliver every single person near future. Eventual control virus take combination successful treatments vaccines. saw guy Walmart mustache. doubt, justify spreading bullshit though.

but, judging votes, people clearly love bullshit long aligns viewpoint .... (to desantos) name Inigo Montoya killed father (by covid) prepare die. (Not really, dad...) Hey there's paywall, could summarize results were? Hot damn, response got removed stayed, wow. Pressure reopen parks become enormous states. go gym discuss one many staffers working wife? people said lead season NFL even make past week 1 without major outbreak, also show admit they're wrong. sides even, stop dragging ""I Told So"" photo-ops. thought masks those. kinds masks US? Yay- let’s shut everything down! get appropriate way wear mask, insist mask protecting others bad fact. mean, protected, you. happening now. infuriating always hated kid know totally justified. Ahhh!!! regulatory encouragement, would possible move entire industry takeaway model? Really exciting news! Especially folks keen vaccine! I’m sure 28k employees already living poverty, close it. It’s bad response, collectively, poor still cut rest world. battle shouldn’t California, feds due lack giving shit. I’m getting 1 month old passport next week, can’t go anyway. It’s crying shame... incredibly embarrassing.  smaller world. Well, FL really lax precautions facing far higher death rate.

Turns need socialist heathcare system reasonable society carry mandated restrictions (btw it’s Sweden full open).  exactly racist statement ?  massive opportunity cost, holy shit. overreaction virus going cost us decades pandemic over. fucking people make laugh. lack intelligence understanding long term ramifications people.


My sons school first reported COVID case, second week school taking precautions every sense. got tested day negative. can’t return school, means can’t work. (Full custodianship). pretty terrified knew based USA it’s handling pandemic, knew higher chance either us would exposed (I work, unfortunately people aren’t taking seriously, go school- kids whose parents may also taking seriously sending COVID infected kids schools).

And top fuck current government serve also severely sociopathic gross mismanagement shit. social programs government brittle like asbestos shit cancer. 

Isn’t also funny Dump also monetary interests could plausible wanted open save resorts- guessed it; hotels,airports restaurants got hit hardest. “Food, beverage hospitality” pays $750 taxes rest us pay much much more. 

I’m ten billion percent voting Dump. Fuck guy, fuck everything done relation pandemic. got go. 2 cans per person? customers accept told illegal? like preparing second wave lockdowns. Agreed! start Reddit COVID-19 book club subreddit!!! say illegitimate, im explaining blown yet. What's acceptable ratio deaths per job? wife staying town (12 hours away) friend got alert coworker job tested positive. friend went instant test came back '75%' (I know enough know means 75% probability friend positive?) take thorough test come back 3 days. 

I know 'viral load' plays big factor severe illness may test positive. wife come back home immediately avoid contact friend? Obviously we'll keep quarantined we've already working home, I'm trying take sensible next step rather freak out. loved bit decided open pubs fucking Saturday UK. Well i'm sorry misusing symbol i'm shit-tired typing phone, sincerely hope offend way; *I get it, quite frankly, know much care. :P*

EDIT: Cheers pointing though. ;) Well, would get onboard science masks could open like China Japan.

But deniers keep dragging out. care alone. I've seen well dozen times. makes sense. account history odd though. delete posts comments while? there's definitely obese man article. thin woman, one deserve thin? Watch post get removed saying something like that. Hopefully stay vigilant pass sooner rather later. Keep good fight! company actual trial, trustworthy source... news. Florida!
People go Florida party, die. onion. unbelievable experts say it. Sorry, I'm cognitive issues, often use words phonetically similar. **wear Right, comfortable, trying stop spread pandemic. deal uncomfortableness. Came this. Thank you. 

I strongly opposed people wearing masks like this, also hate people spread misinformed bold claim headlines without thinking through. harm good IMO Particles mouth float dozens feet airflow. nose firehose, give enough pressure propel directly ground many people who's faceheight peoples noses.

Just wear correctly, people fucking lazy selfish takes less effort picking fucking nails. Brazil I'm necessarily favor ubi, pandemic ... I'm surprised sickened rent moratoriums, food assurances etc.

It makes sense even consider way.

Non essential workers stay home, ergo make income. forgo income good society spread covid. what? else forgo income sake? forgoing income cannot continue pay rent. ask landlords also forgo income pandemic. makes perfect sense me.

Meanwhile certain functions essential must continue. particular supply chains food supporting resources, fuel, roadways, etc, course medical services dependencies. lean towards caution disaster wholesale nationalizing services. Short that, needs maintained price structure within services supporting structures. Ok fine give everyone stipend food maintenance (not ""shelter"" landlords essential service, though maintaining properties is, remember we're also asking landlords bear ""no income"" sacrifice. maintain present ownership temporarily forgo income it).

I'm open medical fully socialized, temporarily otherwise. could also cash allowances spending priced medical services ""insurance"". *Shudder* y’all lookin like dick noses Great. make 250 million doses.

Per month.

For per dose.

No?

Then matter reopen world. falls squarely category one. like holding umbrella half meter away everyone masks, due age disability. solution find someone shop them, stay home. [no new coronavirus cases connected Memorial Day party Lake else would information come from? Serious question: know wearing mask protection others around us ourselves.  talking, moisture droplets spit spreading others.

Just much moisture spreading comes breathing nose? would think covering nose self safety others. (Based told touch eyes nose especially touching surfaces.) know coughs sneezing covering sleeves. Yup. school taking even kids... parents morons, thinking “oh, hasn’t lot cases kid’s school...all fine!” Social distancing isn’t becoming impossible classrooms...all thanks governor’s dumbass mindset. forcing schools take every single kid matter capacity inability adhere CDC’s health organization’s guidelines. appointment Saturday plan wear KN95. news, water wet, sky blue, Trump going down. people *pretend* wash even worse

you're really gonna go effort turning water half second run air dryer another half second? exactly trying fool? truth understand major candidates mass produced *right now*, millions available soon approved, right? Well, could get arrested. pretty unsafe covid-wise, since get put crowded jail. still better mask,

You realize people breathe nose effectively mask people breathe mouth makes zero difference. desperate. useful definitions terms like *South* *West*. Fortunately, US Census Bureau define includes every state south Mason-Dixon Line Texas east plus Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland Delaware. bit difference winter weather Kentucky West Virginia Florida.

West even varied terms climate since everything west North Dakota Texas. Hawaii Arizona well Alaska Montana.

I clear distinguishing Southern tier states (HI, CA, AZ, NM, TX, LA, MS, AL, FL; combined population 113,305,387, 34.5% total 50 states + DC population, bit 1/3) states. One thing keep seeing reddit people wondering earth others believe government lifting restrictions means things safe.

I know, seems little crazy, especially given information know compared government actions US.

But lot people really, really believe government acting like things safe, things safe. Maybe they're ignoring info contrary, maybe never even see it. trust state open pandemic still bad. way road would stay closed unstable tree cleared. please keep mind, *should* able trust government basic public safety. crazy thing can't. Except opening makes people think everything fine control, isn't, leads infections deaths. Canada always free. However takes us weeks get it. Cause websites pharmacies keep saying ""it's coming"". No, way vaccines work achieve herd immunity giving virus hosts certain time frame. causes virus essentially go extinct among population unless reintroduced keep circulating. 

It's possible without vaccine time frame long natural herd immunity. point becomes part seasonal illness rotation herd immunity. That’s Santa coming chimney, it’s swat team. !remind 6 weeks using fact US ducked 1000 deaths day week rationale? mean, crossed words wrote ones again, get it. Covid :
1) Reinfections recovered patients. Multiple strains Covid there.

2) antibodies seem last 6 12 mths

3) potentially people infected vaccines out, higher chance mutations.

Non-Covid 
A) need seasonal flu vaccines, 100% effective. 

B) Homosapiens herd immunity viruses like flu, measles, malaria COVID fatalities much lower could we've made huge changes behavior. changed behavior much prevent car accidents, would much much fewer.  We’ll see much energy people ventilator ICU. Bezos DOUBLED money. Richest even doubling. Fake till make it? Anyone feeling well get tested, self diagnoses leads terrible outcomes. No, follow much affect heart mild cases average people, looks like damaging heart often thought. 100% 

I washing groceries sterilizing shit like door month. leave house etc.

 Eventually started hanging outside parks shit. outdoor dining, back work full time (at restaurant) indoor dining starts week. We're definitely less cautious. 

Everyone still wears masks least, part. still try avoid subway I'm one long commute. idea point you’re making Damn guys pay flu shot? Jesus Christ Less death better death. Ideally death least think complaining everything Got flu shot drive tent outside Kaiser Hospital last week! Super quick convenient. hail god emperor! cares. made money Wait Supreme Court strikes Obamacare lingering medical conditions COVID become preexisting conditions. school district? Canada, USA elsewhere? impossible enforce. Usa canada eat wild bear &amp; moose. Nordics japan eat wild whale. I, living singapore go fish sometimes. u propose prevention actions? looking wrong angle. government applying brute force people, using pandemic instrument. want us dead, unknown reason. least, that's looks like here. -- Essential Worker. evidence being? Wuhan reopened locked 76 days eliminated cases. 10mm population, 50K infected 4000 deaths. Lombardy district also 10mm population, locked 2 months 9 days, almost amount time Wuhan did. 60K infected 10K deaths. Considering Lombardy higher death rate older population, data looks extremely similar. Chinese hiding cases, Italian must same. I'm you, strong hard feels unfair stuff like heartbreaking regulations exactly same. see drastically smaller flu season year it. Wow, something actually properly weigh on.

I Kiowa work healthcare, tell 100% confidence article complete bullshit.  Would agree many overweight people suffer depression? dont care human rights economy, keeping pandemic doorsteps pretty easy. 

People seem forget whenever say don’t believe China’s numbers.

In Denmark seeing increased numbers people partying, illegal parties 300 participants. usually get away it. February obviously lied. There's reason dozens studies come touting efficacy masks. Except DNA evidence ancestors either. Natural herd immunity would leave genetic traces could linked people living time period. know one ways trace ancient plagues. 

The reality natural herd immunity humans. Generally virus / microbe rolls population, decimates it, never goes away keeps circulating killing high rate fair regularity. 

Evolution directly observed via adaptation. theory sense science never fully say ""yes happened"" anything, always open ended. However based observational genetic research confidently say evidence natural herd immunity ever occuring humans. 

The entire premise herd immunity general, even animals, relies low population density low / rate travel. Absolute worst pain dull ache hours later good thing. 

The ache indicator proper immune response triggered vaccine working you. Plus, dangerous go vote, less likely people turn so. Except folks still believe it’s hoax / bad media said, happen voters. guys keep saying this? Cases deaths mostly urban centers disproportionately affecting older minorities. Biden's base Trump's. 6 weeks now: Florida hospitals capacity Yes. still require masks social distancing wherever possible ? Wasn’t evidence everybody wore masks would severely limit transmission ? Reagan eroded trust government organizations.

This convinced Capitalism Humanity compatible best we're going get 4-8 year pause rise fascism USA. logic poor sadly 100% correct.

It's old news. never big deal. Yeah, sure guess kinda scary deaths spike little like that. spike ended. bad. Imagine number people stayed home social distanced year - number stayed home prevent car accidents - deaths there'd be.

r/LepoardsAteMyFace think restrictions look like? Bars, theaters, live music venues, restaurants, things like salons closed limited, mask mandates - past several months that's I've seen. restriction place elsewhere in, say, Miami?

Restrictions FL AZ relaxed compared states like CT, MA, NJ, NY months now. FL moved final phase reopening. explanation cases declined FL despite relaxed measures compared harder lockdown - articles like seem say differently, I'm going dig numbers. 

Frontloading deaths beginning year ending relatively normal mortality rate whole year means people died literally months left live. Mortality 2020 whole abnormally high, closer average 2019 (abnormally bringing Peru ignoring everything makes unique.

Because nothing Peru unique except lockdowns. plenty poor countries Arizona lower population density NY -- yes, higher overall ""urban"" population that's outweighed massive NYC - again, also comparing apples oranges New York City got hit hard early time implement restrictions, mask mandates, etc.

You still addressed CT Florida video - first, people TV I'm talking county city public health officials, whatever random talking head grab.

I personally know someone works public health department NYC agrees lockdowns bullshit talked publicly. watch Florida video see speakers mention lot scientists/experts reached admitted support lockdowns afraid backlash say Florida video - parts scanned - saying ""No restrictions, life normal!"" - experts seem calling smart, targeted restrictions. saying ""There's much prior immunity there's reason worry!""

I never claimed everything 100% normal everyone, said use age-targeted approach, yes advocating, yes, words means letting young people/college students live NORMAL lives (that's chose specific time stamp) Dry ice sublimates commercial freezers I’ve taken position validity survey. enough information article reach conclusions regard.

Just FYI Worth it. chance admin's friend make buck, bet happen.

Its simply pathetic.  I'm advocating masks ever happened whole point made ""masks guard particulates mouth speak cough"". either whole argument bullshit idea wearing mask wearing nose bullshit.

I'm really starting loose faith arguments point. like making shit left right point. foregone conclusion, going clear sometime next year limited immunity long-term. takes time understand, I'm used it.

[And tell wear correctly, punch (Austrian news German, didn‘t find translation)  mind. current status quo unsustainable. soon vaccine available, public support every measure swiftly collapse. mask social distancing. good enough covid way good enough flu.

Again, usually observed. Boomers mostly There's thing sportsball. go around calling tabletop role-playing games belittling names like ""Monsters Wizards"" something particularly enjoy. need dick like sports. zero sum game, unfortunately. many researchers, labs, funds go around, researching one thing necessitate taking another. Undoubtedly additional funding added, 40% drop cancer research pretty clear manifestation resources shifted. 

And sure, temporary. ton experiments halted need restarted altogether (you can't pause middle medical research ‐ throws another uncontrolled unintended variable in) result people die important treatments discovered/tested years later would otherwise. fine that, I'd say tunnel vision.  read Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said Tuesday ""no way"" country's second nationwide coronavirus lockdown would lifted three weeks originally ""There's way 10 days we'll lifting restrictions saying over, everything fine,"" told public broadcaster Kan.

Edelstein said *not* going lift restrictions deadline passed. indicative ""the lockdown extended"", ""we lift *some* restrictions 10 days, *all* them"". emphasis ""no way"" instead ""all"". know seems you, seems way me.

Did *you* read article? made political science tossed window. oh GREAT

another case BIG GOVERNMENT trying tell live LIFE seems bad pales comparison shit did. Definitely ex reason. there's many dumb people experts come say   suicides tick slightly, overall mortality decreases times national economic quit job weekend bc allowed go home cold fever (still recovering it.) Shockingly everyone wears masks. They're worst. purposefully ignorant, stupid, both.

Stop projecting. love irony tho. 

I guess spell you. discussing US leadership's horrible response claimed worse rest world. cited death numbers simply illustrate thinking logical fallacy. made mention complexities virus's impact represent one statistic end large scope impact. terrible debating, BTW - good god.

You're following dumb-ass script copied Right delaying herd immunity.

AWAKEN SHEEPLE! BAAAH! argument tired one. Anything democrat criticized right simply done democrat. lazy argument.

The people reference article ties scientific method experience developing vaccines listen them. problem breathing nose. Y'all conspiracy theorists Wilding. Let's suppose person part secret government propaganda organization, exactly would control people? first assumption first assumption ""oh maybe get lot replies."" Generally protest next people entire time, also protestors wearing masks. almost like virus potential spread exponentially that's case we're screwed, since vaccines best 80% effective, everyone able take them. prediction well. Umm, duh? research, one ""taking"" anything away anyone. temporary shift. People going go right back original fields/focus control. *Sturgis entered chat...* Spending many points HP strength stats instead Intelligence point Luckily cold seasons soon people spend less time outside. influenza

Yes, wearing mask influenza A. likely infect anyone else. would think so, think people really hate masks see viable alternative really not. It’s fine go outside huge numbers. Also bears ramping hibernation staying indoors may save life.  shit cancer survivor aware chemo damages immune system point even simple illness become deadly. cannot understand wrong people like that.

Did anything it? Stand them? back all? Like Russian Roulette. Chainsaws actually invented used around genitals, “assist” childbirth. BEACON LIGHT! SCIENCE CATCHING UP! Kretschmer one two PMs trying avoid implementing central govts guidance NPI. Also one met COVID conspiracy theorists appease part base thinks climate change SARS-CoV-2 hoaxes.

Btw like Saxony, people even dialect. politics swamp. Mmmk I’m done reasoning here. good day. Actions as...? Limited 10 people otherwise shut down. Kind reminds someone’s pants falling keep walking around like that. ^ literally false equivalency? Surely mask provides benefit preventing spread coughing mouth breathing? 
If didn't, covering noses? Using this. THOUGHT peak beginning. Things going ever get better sooner come terms that, sooner accept meaningless existence now. prefer, ""Your face-penis out."" never said did.

Still consequences actions taken. Poop floor made floor Classy af!! That’s dumb shit, masks obviously uncomfortable breathing without one preferable. See: fact nobody wearing masks “added comfort” pandemic. Sigh. know im watching tonight guess. near store begin fake coughing fit, watch masks fly correct position Also, think easy society feel detached major events feel like behavior need change based them. read news Russia invaded country North Korea threatening world again, aside fact know information, life changed. 

That terrible analogy. pandemic distant event side world. *It happening here.* life *is* changing result this. Nobody seriously pretend like disconnected, affect one way another behavior influence it. think that’s it’s problem self diagnose tested you’re unwell.
I think article try reduce anxiety inform people much possible Coronavirus symptoms discovered regularly. know people better options send kids school, people care. laws sending 3 year old, even need school yet, ""fun"" preschool. mom work. kids wear masks. why? makes angry. Yep: bad community spread spot / among people. 

So, say, party’s outdoors amongst college kids who’ve partying summer Sunbelt: bad.

If party’s Long Island among sedate set Manhattanites, bad. Mammon worshiped, poor sacrificed. regular push lawnmower warning operate within 50’ animals structures. abide warning exactly 0% property. Im fucking livid schools open. put work get things control throw away opening schools. Absolute disaster. Avoids fog glasses. *malicious compliance* Il y'a des deuxièmes vagues partout nothing initial virus outbreak. city dying organized around millions people commuting office towers, vanished overnight won’t come back another 6-12 months. Yes I’m advocating people wear mask improperly *but*...

I think people confusing risk transmitting virus risk contracting it. 

Sure, might likely get nose isn’t covered you’re likely transmit.

It’s funny everyone pretending like think critically discerning regard science they’re missing this. Interesting, never thought way think spread covid cough nose fine call ideal ""cruelty"". quite common. back March, Americans realizing COVID might actually scary, video released called Plandemic. video “doctor”(she discredited) tells us wear mask nose virus cause “coronavirus expressions” you’ll get sicker.

But it’s still hoax right? /s personal incredulity, valid reason dismiss researched scientific evidence. follow post posted articles “Science” NIH.org. 

I could also give anecdotal evidence people know smoked whole lives, nineties, never developed cancer. mean smoking doesn’t cause cancer?

Your argument logically atrocious, doesn’t take account statistical data. Require masks actually work require all. bullshit we're going right stupid, everyone requires wear mask.... yet walk people wearing masks absolutely nothing... people confused one wants wear them. Please explain Hair dryers hotels sticky labels advising use shower...........*in shower* fair, mouth breathers. put much meaning highest one day increase thing. know increase significantly last 3 days seen sharp falls confirmed cases risen again. pure speculation maybe backlog testing samples seeing now. really idea is. want make sticker says “DICKNOSE” little line drawing pipi sticking underwear secretly put people’s backs wearing masks properly. 

Maybe handing informational brochure would less petty? cares, kids fine, it’s parents problem True. 

So you’re likely get covid you’re covering nose. 

But literally spread less virus mouth covered. first thought. Mouth breathing sign lower average brain activity.  Cry baby. go 3 pointer? #THANK YOU! Looks like correct.  mean covering nose sufficient? found false positives. lab tests came contaminated (I can't remember how). redid tests, every player originally ""positive"" negative glad need experts tell us that. Sigh. 

Experts buttology state wiping ass shitting cause butt rot. went local pharmacy recently, strict mask policy... pharmacists nurses wearing masks way... Instead putting mask nose, considered taking glasses wiping / warming up? wonder rainex-like product would prevent fog forming all. stupid, ridiculous thing think. Yes...but mask mouth SOMETHING...... feel like played record last spring closings, no? Deja vu? Shot? Lol fucking America.  mean ILLEGAL rallies violate local health guidelines held despite local leaders pleading come? matter limiting risk, going take attitude every life matters cut risk zero banning cars. that's okay must empathetic person think pharmacists stupid? several serious health problems I've one several dozen times since March. Every single pharmacist remember seeing wears glasses either wearing mask wearing nose see pills. I'm much concerned getting wrong pills tiny chance getting virus since medical mistakes kill many hundreds thousands people year. Three years, two years. fifty million deaths.

That's fifty times many dead people right now, playing home game.

So, one could argue perhaaaaaaps went back normal LITTLE FUCKING EARLY.  I'm big proponent shutting businesses either.

What's big tradeoff wearing mask? bought boyfriend set xl masks bc average mask ride up/down face talks. adjusts back, lot touching ordered large ones thankfully fit. know bigger masks, bought several normal size masks fit thought deal it. 

Like trying it, happens talks. One professors always ends like too. obviously unintentional watch slide nose talk. 

I'm saying try find solution, literally common blue medical masks talking perfectly fit everyone. definitely ride people's faces even wearing properly. Ahhhhhh, crop dusting. think there's jokes could made honestly, funny. get people killed. terrible knock effects cases climb, people die, take time work recover. putting economy people's lives. Regression towards mean null hypothesis. needs rejected conclude something else, second infection worse (which think implying). contradicted, friend. data. yes makes sense. publish turd research together. I'll contact New Englnd Journal Poop news, bear shits woods one think children? news 5. Mostly northern half country we’ll indoors little fresh air circulating we’ve insulated ***hell*** buildings cut heating costs.  weird face wrong. 

Just kidding. bet live somewhere really humid. 3 players least? Like infected folks lives' less value?

Sorry downer, heart hurts much lately. can't see homeless persons İstanbul much. (I even living rich side didnt see anyone homeless 17 years life.) curfew times pandemic opened lots building homeless people.

But see beggar streets sometimes people making lot money reality poor seen. (actually thats illegal buy running police.) im disagreeing you, ive definitely noticed significant differences wires different masks, dont bend stay well others might know got bad brand open Maybe effective mouth-breathers. like 15 minutes Disney. two glorious months peaceful. traffic, take life hands driving. grocery store stocked neat.

Jesus miss it. Oh yeah they’re way back Williamsburg Washington heights Compliant non comiance Even .00002% people age group dying, way tell causes die. Like there's info yet x=higher chance dying, etc. 

So realistically would probably fine, possibly asymptomatic, maybe knocked couch couple days, there's equal chance I'm one 25 year olds spends 4 weeks hospital dead. really worth gambling on, even odds good. 

Not mention, knock system, what's gonna long term consequences? seatbelts? Airbags?  shit clog like paper does

they narrow pipes ""FREEDOM"" think braveheart something Yeah especially humid interiors (I've far east exiting air conditioned taxi walking outside!), honestly find impossible deal wearing mask.  dumb unable work real reason, would require self reflection part know impossible prejudicial person like yourself. Someone virus that’s would big factor. Surprisingly one virus party, nothing pass on...... luck draw guess Yeah rub faces socialized healthcare affordable medicine. like we're already sick tired system. Choo choo. Herd immunity train departed.

To answer questions :
 lot things Sweden really smart. Social distancing. Secondary schools closes. Wfh wherever possible. Everyone cold symptoms stays home paid sick leave. travel inside country advised. Swedish citizens companies high compliance govt recommendations. worker definitely easier get wfh SWE rest EU. made decline cases possible. also anti-science party spreading bs pandemic measures. extremist rightist opposition party doesnt say virus hoax. say govt locked like FIN N.

Also scandinavian countries end road virus taken Italy, reacted early relative spread.

Also rest EU tried tourist season, Sweden basically locked out, considered virus contrarians Europe. one wanted travel tourists summer. No, saying Sweden used strategy right wing populist countries. US, Brazil, UK, Russia. Play down. That's got bad numbers.

I focus total deaths. They're really bad. Neighboring countries cheating. Iceland, South Korea cheating. suck compared them.

US safety net too. Unlike Sweden, several countries gave questions asked check citizens. Sweden require pay unemployment insurance, part disappears government black hole, completely broke get like $400 month Socialstyrelsen. nothing special. special thing lot private companies decided work home. wait FHM.

No, complete bogus. Sweden laws countries. Swedish government could exact thing Norway, Denmark, Finland. people mention ""ministerial governance"" politicians want avoid responsibility. last time politician punished ""ministerial governance""? complete nonsense.

What part ""ministerial governance"" prevented government starting stockpiling manufacturing again? enacting border controls? really think Swedish politicians would go prison recommended mask use FHM didn't? Absolute rubbish.

Nobody cares GDP here. GDP Wallenberg's money. care *wealth*, average Swede laughably low wealth losing money right now.

Sweden 4th least corrupt country world. That's bullshit index like happiness index. Look window, evidence ""happiness"". Sweden incredibly corrupt, that's economically 3rd unequal country world (wealth gini). Look countries top list, there's Russia, Ukraine Brazil. 

The difference Swedish corruption benefits elite. countries, regular people pay favors. Sweden, corruption favors Wallenberg, Bonnier, smaller scale socialdemokraterna on. Regular people can't pay get ahead.     clearly affect disease severity extent claiming. Obviously processes stochastic. fact overwhelming trends age certain underlying conditions determining disease severity outcome shows random factors small comparison random.

Also stop using introductory stats terminology apply lol. would reasonable use ""infectious dose determines disease outcome"" null hypothesis never shown case human viral disease? We're also experiment, gather evidence accept reject hypothesis? saying weird.

As far random processes, like sleep, concurrent infections, stress, etc: effect disease outcome there's ton evidence things affect immune function (and btw affect likelihood develop diabetes heart disease too). say they're random processes though, except maybe concurrent infections.  Let’s honest though, 90% people know purchase “luxuries” don’t need. Television/streaming providers, expensive foods, cell service plans beyond calling emergencies, animals, etc. shame buy anything outside means. said lot people means frivolous things smile lost ability reality long long time come due economic implications rolling shut downs. Life vs money hard choice. There’s winning period. According one best friends, right died, cause preexisting conditions old. can't deal friends, family coworkers anymore. I'm exhausted hearing non sense. know convalescent plasma, according article, HCQ showed benefits small preliminary studies, FDA pulled EUA larger studies showed none. NIH still studying possible benefits point, indicating FDA acting pressure !RemindMe 3 months

My prediction: going fine population 1.3 billion, million &lt;0.1%. Lmao WAIT TWO WEEKS guess depends upon consider fortunate: I've unemployed six months due COVID-19, extremely concerned elderly father, lives another state exposed twice fault own. I've lost weight stress portion control (I eat much I'm anxious). I've comment removed before, care. Feels like pandemic weaponized American people. wear mask. picture shows pulled down, pulling drink eat something plausible explanation. Social safety net???? America? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL COVID *only* 0.05 Great Leap Forwards. American COVID deaths 0.01 Great Leap Forwards. Without taking account population growth! Hurr durr... implied, wish people would see dumb is. Florida needs sweet sweet sales tax money Waves things go down. [Anyone looks deaths clearly see gone Therefore two waves. 

Late April peak deaths caused first wave, deaths decreased start July second wave started. peaked August. starts going third wave. 

Many states experienced different national picture. California argue one long wave, others Louisiana clearly two waves. Correlation causation ""The medical community divided""

Not really much country that's crushed primarily simple common sense public health measures. Herd immunity ""thing"" finitely ""reach"" one day mostly natural infections. always moving target based population movement, levels sustainability, individual immune systems, small possibility reinfection. muh buzz word makes sound educated exactly want.. smh Well, Trump's government yes.

Obama's White House would done way better job. Lol omg people wait x weeks. still believe crap trolling? Jezz. download APP months now. polices must knocking door everyday.

 Somehow communist government create APP super bad google FB one care. might want look track record Chinese communists vs. people China talking would win civil war. Really, is? bet even saying dude, least like that. pretty much saying ""man, really let go deserves it"". gained bunch weight doctors completely failing properly diagnose Iron Deficiency Anemia due clotting disorder soon finally became iron sufficient lost weight gained. would never happened medical monitoring treatment stop blood loss restore iron hemoglobin levels.

Also, still seen study conclusively established obesity without conditions like diabetes high blood pressure actually real risk factor. stupid, stop trying pass blame people severity symptoms, yes obese makes likely suffer saying things like ""most blame placed you"" serves either downplay idea lingering symptoms write entirely.

Yeah, get it, fat people suffer ill effects, elderly, diabetics, people autoimmune disease, people always going exist working protect help eachother *including them* write kind lesser caste deserves die.

Near sociopathic lack empathy. I’m genuinely concerned election. Democrat supportive lockdowns anymore (at least anywhere near extent them). think would rather lose actually help little guy. [64% US population lives South West, large population exposed cold weather may Shame smell piss FDA definitely strict, look AstraZeneca's trials much theater? Trying look like something solve issue? 2000 - Never Forget better world could been.

Because let's face it. *Anything* divergence history woulf better this, surely? Hey 40% us think science = politics. drive-through outdoors. Plus extremely far apart. Zero risk involved all. Covid deaths 68%? talking about? Covid deaths peaked early May hundred many days single digit deaths PA. It’s flat line months. India worse . . . what, disagree? Wait, Trump wins election, take vaccine? ridiculous nonsense lol. hope Trump loses silly Take responsibility speak them. do. Many well-known human diseases require certain minimum metapopulation size become endemic within region. (See, examples, Dobson &amp; Carper 1996. BioScience 46: 115-126.) Historically fewer people sharing pathogens, many diseases tended disappear locally. generally accepted main reason mass casualties infectious disease European colonization Americas, diseases going way. similar process led waves human plague deaths Europe, spreading rodent populations endemic regions central Asia. One downsides global transportation system lots human pathogens get shared endemic regions places population still susceptible. Covid act nature. economic devastation act government. Read whole message asshole. chore OPPOSED important thing could dire consequences family comply.

I'll turn right around - live life everyone family could sidelined 3 weeks without impacting rent payments, child care pet care.. GOOD Steven Buscemi play virus. Much, much lower average age. Also fact we're quite aggressive tracking recovered cases may factor. say

""If neglect body *that* much part blame, it, placed you. (for severity symptoms)""

You promoting health, displaying fascistic ideology. neither had/have even remotely met standards EUAs happened transparent push Trump. Florida become cold sore refuses heal . Ugh  USA leading pack million-ish tests/day wait 2 weeks r/NoNewNormal disagrees Unfortunately one listening says law. Walk day life average nypd right . It’s absolute nightmare . cuts devastating women men live families suffering like everyone else . usually you’ve issues past flu shots similar vaccinations, may allergy ingredient. get egg free one every year b/c previous egg allergy stick around, partner kid always free go ASAP. figure? team post science memes 

To compete sexy misinformation Florida man throws party. know is? sick desire see people harmed. know bad decisions like Florida made actually are, since bad news inevitable, sooner better. Always 🔫🧑‍🚀 Clearwater beach? Increased stress, increased financial issues, less reason move around (especially kids), low income kids less access healthier meals school, gyms open (not necessary exercise good resource people hot freezing climates). higher income stable job much likelier come fine increasing gap health. stable job home gym I'm fine. imagine situation fortunate like mine. I'm reading across ocean, seems incredible. 

Your local government needs money gonna allow infect avoid financial collapse? think miss spelled “eat us alive” that, number cases missed probably millions well, like every place world. ramping testing fast number people already got disease unknowable. That's Fauci code ""WHAT FUCK FUCKING MORONS FUCKING DOING?!?!??"" correct answer, sort of. kid would likely get taxed RMDs roundabout way eventually (assuming left IRA opposed sack cash). Check Fauci Derek Lowe. quite literally two foremost experts also speak publicly transparently. anti-vaxxer “whatever dude”.

If going refuse vaccinated, simply believe insane political conspiracy theories, thus, continue threaten way life health community, piece shit.

You anti-maskers. anti-vaxxers. people calling hoax disappear election.

You willing put lives MANY others continued risk, simply continue hold onto paranoid irrational fear government.

YOU continue force remain quarantined rest society selfishness irrational paranoia. 

YOU put life risk.

I hope god coronavirus vaccinations become mandatory, eventually FORCED take it, actually resume flow society, actually leave home without constantly risking life, life family.

I hope selfishness doesn’t end leading death, doesn’t hold back society. nah, everyone live want. 

doesn't mean judge it.  little sad identity politics anti-Trump feelings gotten strong groups people turning anti-vax. grown adult look away. 

Are suggesting psychos watch? Arent still damn first wave? didn't, evidence FDA giving us biased incorrect information either.

HCQ convalescent plasma EUAs say otherwise. Recent data suggests 20-30% herd immunity pipe dream. mitigation efforts (remember lot population using masks many still isolating, taking huge chunk readily infectable population) nonoptimal climate slows significantly stage, without mitigation cool dry climates R0 rise back point we'll see infections areas. 

Those 20-30% seroprevalance range may experience mild waves, 20% barrier hoped really exists certain percentage population still social distancing, wearing masks, experiencing non-respiratory season (all research shows virus behaves like coronaviruses spread best cold dry weather people forced indoors, R0 drop totally like seasonal flu, go away, still definite seasonal aspect). drop restrictions we'll certainly see resurgence areas. Indian cities like Delhi (33% seroprevalance) Madrid (seeing resurgence hardest hit mainland Europe capital) shown us this.

There ""natural herd immunity"" 20-30%. virologists epidemiologists worth salts said this. trying push narratives misconstrued scientists saying range herd immunity could low 43%-60%, start seeing significant decrease infections 20%-30% range. two different things. know common reinfection is, mark could even away. anyways, AFAIK 43% lowest number I've seen anyone credentials consider possible. 

Anyways, possible mild/asymptomatic reinfection common turns bad cold like human coronaviruses, case herd ""resistance"" acquire, without vaccination would certainly take time. would say it? absolutely major reason symptoms horrible were/are estimated projection, parameters comes like this:Herd immunity = (R - 1) / R = (1.5 - 1) / 1.5 = 50%

IFR 0.6% means estimated total deaths = 38M \* 50% \* 0.6% = 110k deaths.

But keep mind qualifier top, assumes overburdened health care system. So, order case guess daily burden infection rate handled health care system? 25k per day? It'll take another 2 years reach herd immunity rate, rate 10x higher highest daily confirmed count. Perhaps handle 10k day, we're adding even years.

In reality, think IFR given recent developments, especially light improved efforts isolate vulnerable populations, along end spectrum, closer 0.2-0.5%, around 0.35%. think maintain 1.2 R average, brings estimated Canadian deaths 27k, look quite realistic given faired first wave, might expect next wave go.

So 13k deaths annual, twice see seasonal flu... barely anything address seasonal flu year. took approach COVID-19 seasonal flu, would absolutely seen 150k deaths somehow health care system get overburdened, likely closer 300k deaths health care get overburdened far probable scenario. understand. feel way. wear mask day every day. don’t think people complaining go office twice week. luxury /s Talk it’s chore? kidding me? course it’s fucking chore! life completely turned it’s head. “Talk it’s chore”? Holy shit. I’m sorry life stagnant asked stay home, sacrifice travel &amp; career plans. lmao promoting health Nazi ideal?

Lose weight buddy, hurting ways physical seems. something something harmonics flu season so? Honest question - reasoning this?

(I've lost 16 pounds isolation.) point they’ve held money ensure passes time checks arrive week two Election Day. 

The best irony would checks late due USPS tampering leading anger populous 45 giving money, leads collective tilt political identify country left. world claps unison... wish something could it. I'm point leave apartment twice per month most. Feel better hug. two little ones can’t image us going that. telling state said rasslin' essential business making stupid policy decision? interesting India recovered cases USA lower total cases. idea why? lunatic rate smaller here, still there. can't society without them. deal though. still answer... :( Mostly garbage internal policy, running fed keep interest rates well past point return, selling bonds excess, ballooning national debt crisis levels weakening US military positions throughout world. TL;DR

Fuck media Stay safe! Yep You’re wrong Walter, you’re asshole. “All cities matter”. 

Oh shut up, trumpanzee. faith him. Ugh  wonder much budget goes towards settlements families shoot citizens. point matter things could handled far differently parents wouldn’t make kinds choices. 

- national plan awareness 
- Far greater testing national level 
- Monetary support citizens, communities, cities aren’t talking anything else.

We talking vaccines politicized. reason trust suspicious vaccines politicization attempting assign vaccines. 

But hey, apparently can’t seem differentiate different concepts, think anything trump even LOOSELY associated compromised, thus, anything produced said untrustworthy.

Thinking FDA compromised, vaccine, approved FDA, would unreliable risky, thus, won’t take it, currently based NOTHING irrational fear government, political opponents. 

It typical anti-vaxxing based upon nutjob government conspiracy theories. 

Opening bars increase corona levels KiLLS tourism. kills dead. guess I’ve COVID since 2009 then. makes far sense put effort keeping children safe flu. Gotta get Snow Birds spend money  That’s flu vaccines work, great would be! Vaccine manufacturers get strains likely pop spring year previous. spend spring/summer optimizing, refining, developing assays, submitting regulatory filings, manufacturing/packaging doses ready fall. huge endeavor involving significant people/different skills sets/man hours per company. worked company many years rest world summer vacation scientists work asses get vaccines time flu season. It’s similar Covid-19 vaccine taking long (but least flu manufacturers established FDA approved vaccine backbone work). 

One point make- vaccine get doesn’t change vaccine get December, Jan, etc. carefully chosen trivalent/quadrivalent (3 strain 4 strain....antigen accurate) vaccine similar among companies, decided upon back spring. Different companies may use different manufacturing methods (egg based vs bacterially derived) different backbones base vaccine, that’s it- demonstrate Safety/Efficacy/Strength/purity/quality guidelines. change later. Get now. 

You’re right though- it’s perfect infallible, it’s still worth doing!!! Especially year! premier, Doug Ford slam everything necessary full support 95% population.

He listens scientists kicks ass. It’s interesting Conservative arch-fiend left despised. left, right centre thinks he’s “the man”. takes 5-7 days first symptom, average. want dollars themselves. Oh god imagine that. agree part that. Banning nothing. someone wants fettuccine alfredo Olive Garden it’s worse burgers there. teach people nutrition cooking. enable food deserts force people work 60 hour weeks afford rent. Everything multi factorial. simple answers. mean subsidize corn much turn tons HFCS. Banning fast food won’t shit that.

Sugar glycerols cause high cholesterol. Look chemical structure. Eating less cholesterol wont stop natural biology clogging arteries diet candy blue ribbon. Excess deaths US quarter million people far year, that's many causes death flu around world even places without coronavirus outbreaks bare minimum extra social distancing. rest live.

But condition? Many may find serious long-term, even permanent effects. Id surprised country like China would allow outside influence control operate way shape form. feel way well. best fry keep going. retired...they pay income tax silly. getting downvoted signaled distancing serious made everyone pushing lockdown huge hypocrite. Vaccination slow spread lowers community immunity threshold. people vaccinated, less susceptible individuals are. wrong? CDC wrong? evidence ignoring? suggesting, like lot contrarian voices do, herd immunity 20%? That's interesting Borough Park NYC currently experiencing large outbreak. Borough Park seroprevalence 50 percent April. sick lectures people dumb asses it. I’ve taking seriously get go, “oh man got believe it” nonsense infuriating.

This. Fuck people. made choice care health, health might expose get it. Okay definitely d-oomer word lol. Somehow uncivil, comment got removed it.

Otherwise good comment Ok, side talking about? coronavirus killed ~~more 1 million people~~ 0.013% world population upended global economy less nine months.

Alternate headline. Exactly remember. ever remember seeing 2. commonly seen 6  Curious DeSantis Scott partying everyone stay compounds Special reasons? Special sauce name... turd vinegar   . get it. year rough. Keep going man Honestly hospitals collapse came close doing, would left. think people would fleeing even are. lockdown least prevented collapse. Yeah, again. We've literally never tried isolate entire population pandemic. I'm sure can't get fact head, even though multiple people pointed you. 

And (and last time I'm saying - like can't read), *I'm making statements whether good way handle not.* contesting ideas we've handled diseases way one somehow unique. zero argument either things (because they're true empirically provable, shown), trying pretend I'm saying something I'm not. Go find someone who's actually making argument whether lockdowns work - I've made statement one way other. AMERICA, FUCK YEAH!!!^TM Georgian, wish  country point fairly open. Maybe virus mutated less lethal contagious

bet life that?  :) Yeah least that's better people bottling feelings. That's happening nearly much think is.  People willing go restaurants bars owners need make money. can't make profit 25% capacity. don’t even need study. Anywhere bunch people face exposed, like bars restaurants, breeding ground Covid  There's also significant amount people may immune due recent past infections coronaviruses. There's academic studies indicating likely could 30% population. Covid projected kill 300,000 Americans 1st December, right equal estimated dead via obesity. Honestly think country try fight that's entirely different topic empirically wrong provided source outrageous claims.

Mortality linked unemployment could remediated stimulus payments. lockdown causes dispair, lack money. year rough me. addition covid diagnosed cancer(I finished treatment currently cancer free). agree worry long last. guess keep going suppose. Ban fast food stomp it’s known long-term impact like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, etc. Kids don’t choice parents, friends schools feed bad food. people infected stretched longer period time, higher probability mutation many strains, negates ""herd immunity"".

Herd immunity works vaccines mass immunization quickly strain mutates another variant, high chance eradicating disease. I’ve already witnessed bars opening shutting ‘rona started circulating amongst staff. Stores forced close virus...  Yeah...but IT’S FLORIDA !!  Tip United States garbage falls ...wait it, FLORIDA. Haha yeah boggles mind!

Was there, absolutely slammed. 

Now Utah. wealthy developed nation.

Wealthy? Sure. Developed? No, need universal healthcare that, pandemic made abundantly clear. pandemic would caused reduced capacity industries now, extent. businesses would needed adjust reduce labor.
People need get onboard virtual learning stop letting fail. There’s way minimal disruption 30% country doesn’t want change anything 2020.

We could locked 6 weeks slowly increased services; 2 week shutdowns started climbing again. Instead, extremely poor leadership Trump administration, it’s allover f’in place ridiculous number people dying. Even look cold heart, could highly skilled workers... they’re consumers... pay taxes... deaths get millions, alone terrible economy. cute right now. course quarantine works. Lockdown widespread quarantine. works. policy worked countries like China. would worked actually done it, people listened propaganda precaution-deniers pretended unnecessary rules apply them.

Now look are. Negative propaganda led careless behavior led surge cases right winter. fault people like spread negative sentiment scientifically proven remedies responsible failure lockdowns work.

Shame hurting nation stuff. deaths 14 day change:  +2 %

7 day average Sep 27: 748

""one day"" enough data make headline, ok? Ever since New York started calm down, place country would get it, news quick say ""second wave"". got frustrated over, think would ok say would second wave gotten cases complete zero weeks another spike. like 'bruv'...... I'm talking Drosten. use money made buy something, I'm paying tax using money paid tax on.

In general, tax transactions, money changes hands. include inherentance even person getting money anything earn it. think pandemic anywhere near over, ""behind us"", delusional. People continue infected, sadly people continue die enough people vaccinated virus slow spread. continue peaks valleys cases, hospitalizations, deaths months come.

Vaccination slow spread, reduce herd immunity threshold. natural herd immunity. CDC said approximately 10 percent American population exposed infection. Locations throughout United States experience second, third peak fall, winter, next spring. likely even seen worst virus yet. We're probably going see fall, winter. I'm wrong, I'm wrong, hope wrong.

You're wrong hard see why. ignoring evidence maintain current beliefs virus. January think know wrong. Save time. Lots discussion aerosol droplets. Nothing groundbreaking physical distancing — farther face mask others, even maintain physical distancing. Face masks lessen amount virus coming people infection, also lessen chance inhaling ventilation opening windows. Learn clean air effectively methods face mask cannot physically distance least 6 feet or, ideally, more. possible, move group activities outside.  reference, 10 million die cancer year worldwide, 17 million heart disease.

The recommendations based assumption/theorized model covid transmission happens via droplet aerosol. And, specific:

* Droplet - relatively ""large"" fluid particles capable carrying COVID particles, tend fall floor mass
* Aerosol - relatively ""small (&lt;100µm) fluid particles capable carrying COVID particles, mass stay suspended air Oh, that's good everyone. Disappointing. Well, sounds pretty fucking stupid me!

I’m fairly well can’t say someone trying survive asshole.

A denier anti masker something fine. Someone trying keep house feed family? Nah need would too. Sad truth: really trust several family members anymore. brother is, sure, anti-mask patriot (his words). parents become Christian warriors Trump hung Back Blue banner across driveway gate. I'm glad excuse go especially election occurring before. They'll either smug vitrolic. kidding - vitriole either way. Happy holidays! known true, yes. Okay, fact completely dodged part there's hell lot people right pushing anti-masks calling hoax, right president, tape admitting downplays virus purpose promotes wearing masks, tells insincere concern this.   Twice contagious, twice less lethal now?? wear seat belt every time use car nothing ever happens, need wear more, Ron Deathsentence said ok  curves flat, they'd line curve Says man never experienced death. back classroom staying safe means accepting new reality

Well said. Victoria's hard lockdown started start August, 2 months, 4. they're 10 cases day exit it. Unlike US they're sticking eradication.

More crucially, Australian states managed avoid second wave without major lockdowns. NSW got 20 cases/day community transmission, got back contact tracing high rate testing. states closed borders Victoria faster mostly avoided cases. Texan, say, I'm moving next year job permits. covering eyes pretending there's path risk all.

This mischaracterization happened, though. Every governor called lockdown carefully reluctantly based information available time. ""blindly"". could lock everything give people stimulus check per month.   Let’s real: online education suitable long-term solution, even places government programs provide computer/internet access everyone. School also kids learn socialize peers. year two lost development really harm mental health children become poorly-socialized adults. Imagine thinking people speak different forms English America? Poor little dude. Thank you. people, man. SMH Oh shit
Oh god 
Oh fuck
Oh shit Ugh. Imagine going clinic hospital one contracting other. people want survive idiocy, ones wearing masks.  People afford staying home, wearing medical-grade masks must go out.  Well either let inspectors deal economic consequences. Women too. current times often one same. Vote. move New York California. LOL. Try keep up. see professionals mentioned, they're journalists. scientists mention working them, well, they're writing part they're informing part. facebook video someone says something like everyone accepts fact. gradual late October December arrive. I’m afraid of. Huh? Banning would literally make fast food unavailable exact opposite “nothing”. Probably good guess. even getting upvoted. aren’t even close level impact, caring stopping Covid mean don’t give fuck people dying flu. fact probably want care less Covid, care flu, hilarious.

Covid crippled world, killed far seriously set back almost every economy, perhaps even causing worldwide recession. Let know flu that. It’s also entirely preventable, don’t want Covid season every year couldn’t stop flu season completely even wanted too, it’s multiple different things every single year.

If could lockdown 14 days completely eradicate flu, would. fact still could Covid, guess people don’t give fuck anymore. Literally 14 days extreme lockdown virus would gone.

I guess it’s trendy reddit say Covid response hysterical though, even though almost every single medical professional America thinks wasn’t even close serious response. also lot tech workers high paying jobs done remotely. even lose job many tech companies still struggling fill open positions here. still buying stuff sales tax collected. honestly think Washington State probably one fastest states recover economically also fewest deaths. Right thought everyone would work together begining everyone return left vs right BS carelessness. Fuck I’ll wait thing guess. Fuckkk must California. Florida Texas weird cousin family reunion. It’s always fun hearing ridiculous stories dumb problems you’ve cause, don’t want addressing us directly. Thank you. sub complete joke now. thought thread conspiracy. realize it’s popular opinion, I’d ok taking things back bit. Fewer people stores, stay home etc. There's also 14 day quarantine requirement reentering Canada think even applies citizens. got pretty steep penalties noncompliance. full circle then? vaccines, no, I'm anti-vaxx way. time got me, well vetted. take medicine hope best, would lovely stuff (meds, cars, etc) used ladies test subjects, too. it’s unfortunate experience, you’re outlier. There’s strong relationship parental education income children’s educational achievement. Closing schools likely worsen outcomes poor students well-off students. west palm.  long term effects? would concerned young. 2. Yes. original paper draw conclusions, early research others continue work. News outlets picking running headlines clicks. kid UK tested positive Covid, influenza influenza B. It’s stereotype redneck kind see saying. it’s simple thinking hey got doesn’t help thick it. States unlike fed allowed run deficits.

Not true. America’s cognitive dissonance full capacity. Seconded. Yep might wait line 5hours Masse, mass ""Lead sweetener"".  WOW. hell that? except didn't. course could. won’t. Exactly. agree. government biggest culprits!. tossers deliberately flaunt rules go fuck 

Some truths need heard! mean ok free judge course. don’t know they’re dumb republicans decent people kids mortgages employees things kind ok this.
I learned one gives shit me.
Like not. Dem rep, I’m alone family everything keep four walls safe secure.
So yeah it’s become political issue sure get that, think month 7 people need need survive. government abandoned us it’s every person themselves/their family. first study read back February 11. knew reality least early, probably earlier. get buddies loot March market oil crashes. 


This crisis completely eroded trust government organizations around world. Especially states. poor places like much Africa, many students leave school system never make up. start working never return school, makes much likely poor rest lives. We’re already seeing increased child labor impoverished places shut schools. Heaven's Waiting Room  look countries worked contain illness, managed survive fine.

But can't nice things MAH FREEEDUMBS! sad hear this. article written journalists buddy, gave actual date sources. referenced studies may may show people may may dying covid. Honestly it’s incredible many liberties you’re willing give extended amount time virus virtually fatality rate healthy individuals common flu. Growing up, education watching Bumblebee Man Simpsons turned fine. Hahahah planet don’t think utterly fucked people aren’t Florida? You’ve clearly never lived there. I’ve lived both. cant find stat CDC. link it? spending much time echo chamber known Reddit we're it, get people stay fuck Texas? disappointed see public health guidance provided multiple occasions disregarded many.

The problem, course, ""public health guidance"" (to wear masks avoid social gatherings) specifically repealed Governor Florida, Ron DeSantis.  last Friday, DeSantis specifically lifted statewide public health orders, penalties violations county- city- orders.  Many people took ""all-clear"", pandemic over.

You really cannot blame students party, Governor specifically issued order let party begin. two entirely different questions. Florida gotta Florida. then, 2 days later, could possibly predicted *this*? evidence ""nasty stuff"" vaccines? Yikes! De Santis already responsible deaths caused mishandling pandemic, guess thousand price business. 🙄 know make certain amount money can’t contribute 401k roll (completely unfounded logical steps head.. evil person would take).

I feel like timing right mess voting major swing state. people get sick, likely younger crowd, would get coming weekend. would experience symptoms following weekend (if any), pass others another venue (church, restaurant, etc.) would start get sick around Oct. 17. Major hospitalizations would start taking place around week election day, death toll skyrocketing around Halloween. shut everything take drastic measures like actually care citizens... first time FL... Nov. 1. Voting become something feared, populated areas hit hardest. throws election question. Trump takes Florida people afraid, everything opens right election... FL. amount people think big deal fucking astounding.

This big deal it’s *as big* deal thought made decision shut businesses March (before information available us today). 

The medical community completely divided comes handling virus. consensus mitigate spread outside recommendations CDC. one thing look data research we’ve gathered since March overwhelmingly implies extreme vast majority people risk complications. also look case trends Florida essentially zero correlation found Florida’s reopenings number cases reported. words, back Florida reopened indoor dining, barber shops, gyms, etc., increase cases. Cases actually continued decline since then. 

At point recognize families children losing livelihoods forced poverty result shutdowns. need weigh different scenarios. consider statistical data showing shutdowns done anything stop slow spread virus, wonder it’s worth families lose homes something doesn’t - scientifically statistically - appear making difference.

I think ways mitigate spread virus without forcing families lose 6th generation family businesses.

Just opinion saying people crowd bars without mask. It’s saying shutdowns seem hurting people they’re helping maybe there’s another way. Ah gotcha. Article paywalled. using world meter numbers. Either way though right worth getting excited yet. Right, we’ve 75% months crores

I google it, means 10 million. Indian specific.  Dr. Trump received MD Trump University playing game ""Operation"" removing man's funnybone. countries leaders take ownership lockdown areas infection support population instead? sort power could supercede decision. course, Vladimir Putin’s wet dream. Oh. Haha. Reading fundamental.  evidence vaccines working differently? make similar burger home mixing Wagyu fat brisket, ribeye sirloin patty mix. Much cost effective well. numbers line countries: young people succumb c19 Took drive downtown Saturday night get idea crowds. Orlando pretty dead still. 

No doubt bars going take advantage.

At least big business sticking mask rules reasonable taking money isn’t tune 50%? Whatever, dude Oh god! Old people want retire?!

How dare they!! idea. state low income tax, still enough get us year far without major cuts. can’t even imagine FL going function without tourist dollars that’s major source revenue. kind missed point, read article, can’t trust numbers coming CDC Florida leading way life expectency probably low poor health conditions many. COVID19 dangerous old people presumably they're fragile poorer health young people. people 60's India state health 80's Western Europe (for example) would similar morbidities. joke.... teach 12-13 year olds. them? worrying times. Keep children safe away Fox News, may yet survive freak show. get tested tho... Less tests less cases? reference big numbers hard conceptualize sometime: 10 million die cancer year worldwide, 17 million heart disease. Conservatives pro-life fetuses, actively pro-death masses aged 1 day up. Agreed.

Unfortunately, non-extreme generate many clicks/eyeballs/bot interactions. here, social media, news sites - it. 

I think mods/communities responsibility, rough responsibility take, tidal wave extreme posts hard hold back. small part downvoting extremes upvoting nuanced discussion. much else random internet stranger do.  long-winded way say “I picked numbers completely arbitrarily”. what's wrong America - many people brainwashed thinking whatever side worst thing ever. They're flip sides coin run lobbyists corporations. Fear hate easy manipulate politicizing issues. Blame everyone else otherwise would require working together solve problems. absolutely hate here. Ridiculous people state government make rest nation look stupid. I'm disagreement you. Simply data they? sounds like revisionist history me. remember talk 3.5% IFR maximum CFR China. think many people believed actual IFR, always suspected much lower detection picking cases. remember lot talk worst case scenarios would increase due hospitals burdened. always theoretical possibility, always knew could prevent occurring lockdowns.

I also remember lot people saying IFR would 0.05% bad seasonal flu. remember legitimate peer reviewed studies citing 50 asymptomatic carriers every positive. 0.6-1.2% range generally accepted 10 times lower estimate, \~1/3rd worst case scenario.

Mortality seems bad side predictions.  See makes 100% sense.  you’re region 5% positivity, that’s PPV ~75% NPV ~99.5%. That’s pretty damn good! Doesn’t really matter kill people either way. Killing people, matter many people kill, reprehensible. exactly think involved public policy decisions one world's experts coronaviruses?  Washington 300-600 daily cases, inherent risk numbers right also way lower. open 300 cases day vs 10,000 cases day, even population differences, significant reduction risk. Oh no, schools open :( stop using title “Czar” please? It’s ridiculous. Simply data. Nothing American advice would “here pharmaceuticals, take go away ***if afford them, can't go away""*** unless goal taxing retiree's estates die covid lock  Losing life (or lives loved ones) livelihood, tough choice. Can't second wave never get first one think could million us deaths spring?! 240,000 Americans projected died Covid-19 November 3 would call pandering. seems like ""agreed upon"" message POC victims institutional racism, are. catch - they've also ""victims"" genetic lottery Vitamin department.

Last time 3,000 people died country started wars track people killed thoes innocent people. could effect getting big Mac willing 9/11 every 2 weeks. Ok makes sense.

If place I’d go safe like warm safe lol.
But vacation hotel? one paid me! First number CDC database, people die November already exposed fatal dose virus. right 50,000 additional deaths Christmas conservative estimate. Could much higher. 

Just flu. -ghost Cain. spent 2 years too. 🤷‍♂️ BLM protests certainly *could* included list. say *could* prolonged indoor activities, indoor restaurants, movies, churches etc majority risk lies, protests almost exclusively taken place outdoors risks quite bit lower. Observers also noted many protesters wearing masks, COVID related fears identified targeted police.

There significant body evidence BLM protests actually lead increase There’s something call viral load, especially 15 minutes. don’t get it... dying isn’t i’m scared People* Black *people* represented. also negligible differences black people, white people, Asian people, Hispanic people forth, considering much medication apply.

The majority determined medical differences closely attributed *social* status melanin adaptation: wealth, health work.

Not say significant impact! understandably challenging frame doses around person's social standing. deadly Americans getting deployed Afghanistan! republicans smart, would legalize weed trust pharmaceutical companies FDA????

They said quell people's fears, pay vaccines come. responding actual evidence FDA operating bad faith, they're last people trust even true. Pharmaceutical companies give shit safety regulations.

The FDA extremely trustworthy, absolutely evidence procedures undermined President. believe otherwise getting round Earth conspiracy territory, far I'm concerned. Ontario. testing people now. reminder: virus isn’t even year old yet. No, I'm not. curve flat, barely cases pop 14 million, stupid keep watching numbers panicking, curve flat New Zealand PEI beg differ. 😁

Travel bans quarantines stop thing tracks. doesn’t legs eh?  10 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday. Wait... US states can't run deficits?

I always assumed could provinces Canada do. TLDR: 12 new imported cases, 0 new domestic case, 26 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

This. WA state income tax still listening scientists. Nevada depends tourism revenue least much Florida does. 

The difference (R) (D) governor’s name. Americans disregard extremely simple safety measures pandemic started Yes father age group came ok, everyone does. physical damage done virus goes beyond death rate. Also highest level hospitalization. he's king understatement. know means well, come on! use stronger words, people dying! FDA, whoever's putting people power there, responsible politicization

What NASA lied us moon landing, shape Earth? didn't, evidence FDA giving us biased incorrect information either. put lot back leaders (at levels) really forward planning.

Early on, lockdowns bought time sure can’t argue that. Months later, much world still utterly retroactive approach ignoring reality months months learning impact people. Perhaps. bottom study says 65%. 35% due causes (lockdown) still pretty significant. happened us state Victoria, Australia. got 150% daily cases single day wave 2 went 700 daily cases winter, hard lockdown, including curfew allow us go house 8pm 6 weeks coming finally, 10 cases today. 

Stay strong stay home! hope schools open. Possible emergency approval mean significant percentage population get vaccine soon. majority US population remain unvaccinated spring earliest. We’re talking trump. Human lives don’t matter topic. Snowbird season October April. Like Florida even cares Fauci thinks... Agreed, one thing note AIDS crisis- ads came AIDS started impact people 'undesirables' grander scale. LGBT folk, minorities, homeless people, IV drug users, folks living non-traditional families? Reagan wholeheartedly said Fuck 'em around 1987. IIRC even accurate tracking AIDS deaths around then, shit going since least 1980.

Only thing is, folks high places current administration decided 'undesirables' means folks listed above, also would like add 'anyone vote us'. Pretty sick.

Source: grew hard hit area AIDS crisis. Now, thought losing 15k-30k people year disease cure feels... sadly quaint. hmm tbh googling. seems articles can't make mind number reflective actual situation. also sound like strong ties Florida. mostly likely mortgage family support, easiest time consider planning move years.

I'm another state (AZ) going take awhile move due mortgage, full time job, kid elementary school, I'm tired stupid state working towards moving somewhere else. 

You want it. always find excuse even try. Simply put, democratic deficit. businesses always choose money health consumers 10 10 times.

Not entirely, would liked seen restrictions slowly eased much later. restaurants maintaining previous COVID restrictions. 

Example: change favorite TexMex place they'll resume hosting D&amp;D sessions outdoors - like prior owner BIG TIME gamer, love place food/menu employees.

Addendum: couple Burrito Boarder employees got sniffles months back. Dave, owner, immediately shut restaurant put public statement. results came back negative 5 days later reopened. 

Some business owners care equally employees customers. really sad impatient people are. killing elderly weak? Came say this, too. also way overshot mortality rate. Trump... cognitive dissonance bloody astounding.
You take someone criticising country's terrible handling pandemic ""anti-American rhetoric""
Just admit country fucked continues fuck ny forcing political issue.  get you’re posting it’s inaccurate. period repentance takes place already within high holidays. first high holiday, ten days second one. Nothing however mandates synagogue attendance 9 days between.

I fully believe it’s communities resisting basic science, like super religious Christian communities do. point it’s Jewish holidays responsible uptick - simply wouldn’t shown yet.

For measure, give 10-20 October cases really exploding.

But think it’s unfair blame Jews Jewish things (Jewish holidays) it’s ultra religious group ultra religious groups general, resisting science.

I find risky blame holidays timing doesn’t match, also empowers psycho go shout synagogue believe it’s that. truth probably it’s community gatherings, weddings, schools etc. worship holy places holy dates. free space. even know bingo works? What’s third wave? hibernate end first whole second? Ok then. imagine cases deaths going increase. People going wary going out. Even that's half customer base, see bars restaurants survive. top flu season soon. want say best thing Florida would hunker winter summer cases low tourists afraid travel there. Even best case scenario coronavirus still around next summer. Remember, Fauci says need get 10,000. Fat chance. Covid America stay. Glad I’m not. It’s nothing really happening. know someone coronavirus, case, handful people. None symptoms worse cold. spattering 60 year olds died rest 70, significant portion 80+. know far people much impacted cancer. It’s simply bad enough engender unified response.

I believe that’s Fauci called worst-case scenario. worse, we’d trying stop it. people, actions, don’t feel like it’s bad enough justify lockdown social restrictions. first number isn’t confirmed, last two guesses unless reliable sources back up. yet you’re passing comment absolute truth without data sources prove so.  surrealistic insanity. living nightmare.

It’s already swayed company lobbying essentially. Citizen petitions used Pharma various thing, namely patent extensions, also campaign get drug approved. Even doesn’t work. live here, won't. could get million cases election still wont go back 20% Million deaths US alone. lots anti-vax concern trolling comes COVID vaccines.

""I'm anti-vaxxer but...""

Sorry, makes anti-vaxxer. it, antivax. don’t get irresponsible.
Coronavirus much worse flu, people anti coronavirus vaccine much worse. not. I’d rather see article story. guys doesn’t deserve time day. pair yes take get sick die. start showing symptoms around 12 days 14 not. asking min seem long show symptoms. say anything max correct I'm doctor. primarily question seemed off.

Also talking one person spreading community. COVID already spread. removing restrictions asymptomatic ones spread unknowing

But leave people reddit vote honest question. Hate break you, idiots unique US. MFGA lol realistic all, pushed wrong direction. numbers way past excess mortality, can't take face value. 2 million goooooo! election five weeks away. DeSantis gambling take six weeks shit hit fan.

Fuck shit article title phrase way one might think daily number cases getting bigger bigger reached 40,000. We've 40,000 cases day since late June (minus weird week early September).

Also, you’re confusing early tests attempted test cells “recovered” patiences in-vitro. assumption drawn false positives triggered shedding inactivated virus. Like said, little reading topics. good foundation you’re mixing different data points. would virtually way know infections persist, yet anyway. surveillance focused infectiousness, contagious. think doctors would agree clear virus, don’t know definitively yet. similar hk.

Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital Study (1963)



In 1963, studies undertaken New York’s Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital understand whether body’s inability reject cancer cells due cancer debilitation. studies involved injection foreign, live cancer cells patients hospitalized various chronic debilitating diseases. Patients informed injection cancer cells informed consent process, consent documented. researchers felt documentation unnecessary customary undertake much dangerous medical procedures without use consent forms.
Further, patients intentionally told would receive cancer cells researchers felt would unnecessarily frighten them. Researchers asserted good cause predict cancer cells going rejected.


In subsequent review proceedings conducted Board Regents State University New York, found study presented hospital’s research committee physicians responsible patients’ care consulted. researchers found guilty fraud, deceit, unprofessional conduct.



Willowbrook Study (1963–1966)


A series studies conducted 1963 1966 Willowbrook State School, New York institution “mentally defective” children. gain understanding natural history infectious hepatitis controlled circumstances, newly admitted children deliberately infected hepatitis virus. Early subjects fed stools infected persons. Later, subjects received injections purified virus preparations.
During course studies, Willowbrook closed doors new patients, claiming overcrowded conditions. However, hepatitis program, occupied space institution, able continue admit new patients. Thus, cases, parents found unable admit children Willowbrook unless agreed children’s participation studies.
This controversial case raised important questions protection children (and vulnerable populations generally), coercive consent, inappropriate disclosure risks, alternative therapies.

Some research Indian communities also horrific. Due CCP's lies. Try decades ago, bud. dumbass trump support around here, expect nothing less; can’t really say I’ve disappointed anyone.  draconian lockdown worth end? Yeah, flu vaccine? motivation mess flu shot? problem way Sweden things compared US done it, depended highly public adhering social responsibilities. asked stay home much possible, practice physical distancing, did. 

But us ‘Mericans? little sense personal responsibility, much less societal. Also, nearly healthy nation Sweden. Sweden aim for, started with, opinion. Imagine making assumption person username lol think also Super Bowl. Dbag DeSantis upset Bucs opening fans start season wants show Tampa ready host SuperBowl year.

I think it’s full political move think extra reason wants people coming etc money state makes SuperBowl. **Sep. 29, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Just wait. take days story reported new covid outbreak. Seriously. tired ""which wave on"" debate there's scientific definition it. USA allows parents treat children chattel property. Good thing viruses mutate days. probably tell scientists tracking known mutations current hoax they're wasting time.

Be sure tell infectious disease experts releasing statements flu season they're morons spreading fake news lies learned word ""mutaton"" today. becoming orphan Sept. 18, FSU President John Thrasher said students host attend large parties gatherings subject suspension. Bullshit. live liberal Northern California county everyone wears masks. county positivity rate less 2% businesses still closed and/or major restrictions local health officials scared shadows thinks everyone lockdown forever. sucks small business owners lost everything. sucks everyone lost jobs/homes/dignity. cure far worse virus live. saying Thanksgiving 2021 this? 2022?

I think I’d starting frustrate lots us lack light end tunnel. know you’re going say - “stop dramatic, it’s one year, one thanksgiving, one Christmas” - though? told flatten curve, wait vaccine, told even vaccine widely delivered keep restrictions place. please excuse us hard time thinking “it’s holidays”.

If CDC, Fauci, Tam (for Canadians) et al., said “Yes, need guys sacrifice Thanksgiving Christmas year - but, get vaccine 2021 **regardless** vaccine effectiveness”, would comply. would sit approach line sanity insanity - would comply. fact finish line .... can’t trust continue make sacrifices now, won’t situation come 2021. Florida leaders need tried crimes humanity, genocide committed desire positive economic benefits. 

They prioritizing money human life.

The richest country human history afford play safe vaccine arrives. Theres one thing often overlooked comes explaining particular moment:

Jeff Bezos rich. doubt it. wealth created almost exclusively tied rise fall Amazon.

His wealth possible lives society strong legal protections large middle class buy products. country falls worth falls it. 

Bezos also engaged lies (2 day delivery complete false marketing helped secure market share), engaged major tax avoidance, around 15% warehouse employees use low income government benefits, accepted 1.6 billion tax incentives, business made hard work. made keeping legal fees lower cost savings barely (and often not) legal things raiding public's coffers whenever goes basically every billionaire name. Hardly given billions.

Almost every billionaires engaged extremely questionable ethical actions. inheritance tax way make sure pay back fair share make did.

And billionaires earning themselves, want anybody inheriting many billions. sadly people continue die enough people vaccinated virus slow spread.

Sorry pointing objectively incorrect. know sensitive. Still, blame thinking know manged say something unbelievably wrong. Oh?? really hope Events leading to"" portion textbook kids reading 10 years even stable society left. Okay well obviously gonna happen people open businesses. yet guys continue hate they're something wrong.



There options I'd get banned saying Unfortunately Indonesia Dr. Terawan, early February said virus well hot humid condition, Indonesia cases February thanks prayers. Meanwhile, preparations made, advice given government actually considered increasing tourism budget lure tourists go China Thailand anymore. \*Sigh\* voted government wholeheartedly, disappoints Covid response. appreciate willingness admit situation complex. agree that. frustrating see way do. think obesity could tackled comparable way. course I'm expert either. Oop Likely small amount likely legal minimum take receive benefits company. 

Which fine. year’s war Christmas extra brutal. Better start training now. think mean “absolute power corrupts absolutely” Covid 19 greater 99.7% survival rate people 60 greater 99.1% people 60, yet sheeple acting like flipped 99.7% death rate. know you, I'm far worried dying traffic accident. super worried Covid. overreaction real, 'information' age. Good. Downvote away virus 99% chance surviving shut whole state let alone country. risk stay home. retirees protesting worth well-under $12 million, they're protesting literally nothing. downvoted. DeSantis idiot all. He's evil asshole pretends simple minded simple minded base. Oh God... know they're synonymous... pointless. Yes, point is? much think bezos makes income...?

Random search says Bezos' base salary modest $81,840, total compensation (which includes things like security benefits) $1,681,840. require vaccines kids attend school. Yet hundreds thousands still vaccinated.  Hmmm feel like could friend mine based username. TX perchance? really wish public figures would pull punches less often. I'd love see headline says ""Fauci says 'pretty fucking stupid' Florida re-opening bars restaurants full capacity."" live one, called Halifax...

Or Toronto, Montreal count cities now? fair, everyone seems think we're barren wasteland inhabited solely fishermen. 🙄 curious, historical stats Estate taxes:



Year | Estate Tax Exemption | Top Estate Tax Rate
----|--------------------|-------------------
1997 | $600,000 | 55%
2000 | $675,000 | 55%
2005 | $1,500,000 | 47%
2010 | $5,000,000 | 35%
2015 | $5,430,000 | 40%
2020 | $11,800,000 | inflation, $600,000 1997 $972,000 today. last 23 years, we've MASSIVELY raised cap exemption, time lowering tax rate exemption 15%. wonder system rigged regular people, ask many people inheriting $12 million parents. pay less property tax half states, sure point you’re trying make Use State Emergency cover. Governments broad latitude regulate times Emergency. even state emergency right health concerns. similar long term health issues let fast food ban survive challenge (at least little while). Rome. delicacy amoung wealthy. Processed sugar really thing. bad rule nepotism barbarians gate. good thing one lives past 20 know long-term effects hoax! Tell parent thank you. Way people aware. rapid testing paying off. death rate far lower initially fear mongered.  problems majority wealth ultra wealthy build never taxes paid it. cash millions stock take loan use stock collateral? interest expense reduces taxes. Eventually die, basis points reset assets. Florida also shit unemployment raided pay business tax-cuts. real shame happens states get help federal government combat national crisis combination poor financial decisions. 1% Americans died, statistically Steve still higher chance friend Linda killed covid, 1/100 bad odds virus affects people clusters either know lots virus, none.

In situation, 4million Americans would died, still insignificant number dead Americans? I’m saying many die Covid, it’s explanation ‘I don’t know anyone Covid can’t real’ stance super stupid. Vaccination slow spread lowers community immunity threshold. people vaccinated, less susceptible individuals are. wrong? CDC wrong?

Community immunity herd immunity synonymous. wrong said without vaccinations would end virus. That's possible would gain herd immunity naturally instead usual mix natural vaccination immunity. ~~evidence~~ ignoring?

* draconian measures appreciably, all, change reproductive number, even though aware sites keep track it.

* nothing NYC's situation described ""a large outbreak"" - contrarian voices experts evidence supports say. example, Sunetra Gupta. Oddly enough, think cherry picking things fit narrative.

It matter. One us right wrong time prove which. live Missouri ongoing fight masks since beginning. St.Louis city/county putting pretty strick rules wearing masks/limits gatherings etc..things rough start first starting get slightly better. Ozark country free all..noone wants change anything lives ""God given right"" refuse "" sheeple"". Numbers rural MO going way several areas considered ""hot zones"" people give shit. Granted brilliant Governor refused wear mask long time want enforce it..now wife COVID..smdh. dad said thing. counter “so hold insured properly higher regard human life?” Pro-life party fucking ass  Lmao - AQ’s joke. professions require continuous learning nothing special. Toronto-centric, check salaries around province:


Sudbury: $96,000 four years ago top rate (page Valley, four years ago top salary $96,000 (plus $500 get masters, lol) p Francis (look up, pretty much “not tdsb”) top salary $99,467 2019. argue don’t get paid across province better-paying boards get good teachers. pay within thousand (they also preserve place salary grid switching boards unionized employers retain recruit talent)

Also, wtf making like anti-teacher? said don’t deserve money earn. merely commenting even good money much incentive comes risking personal health. absolutely agree online ""education"" replacement school, issues diminished get higher grades/university, still better nothing. Ah, cool. Thanks. telling truth time lying reasons? hate New England too. flair Florida won’t stay Florida forever. long spills Georgia Alabama? Worse yet, thoroughly think college kids traveling Thanksgiving spread around country. 

The lack strong federal response disgusting. I’ve never ashamed country. Tens thousands die due fed’s incompetence. Medicare All. Single payer healthcare system US opposed current barbarism employer-based health insurance, littered sorts hidden fees, copays, deductibles, etc.

I listened Fox News. I’d like admit. It’s obvious arguing bad faith, cornerstone network racism bigotry. But, Republicans masters messaging. They’ve managed convince 51% country policies, good 1%, good everyone. Especially weekend tally. 

You'd think they'd counting way every day. Funny virus seems relax weekends. I'm expert, would wager obesity many factors deal with, income, workweek, lifestyle etc fight need look thoes issues. covid, masks, handwashing distance make significant difference, relatively achievable end sight. spend trillions guarantee people could saved issue eliminated, vs chance people might save themselves, especially kill roughly per year, I'm putting money covid. could wrong, said, I'm expert. Part reason Nevada state income tax gaming revenue. Casinos shut 3 months. really hurt budget main income source gone quarter year. Orange county dashboard reports covid numbers,the school board made clear thrilled opening recommend anyone staying home possible. 

I really think huge incentive hide positive cases, I'm certain plenty positive cases reported. think majority are.

If go OCPS.net click covid dashboard, main page... see number students teachers infected school, day infections reported number individuals currently active quarantine. Whose rectum pull .003% fatality rate figure of? difference taking earning. billionaires take money selling house, car, plane ticket, new shiny smartphone, entertainment Netflix, goods Amazon? No, handed millions others. Now, upset wealthy? made wealthy.

Here's secret. really want screw rich, stop giving little money have. Oh know. rephrase. contribute limit make limit. company 401k plans straight tell can’t contribute. 

So Jeff bezos contribute 401k lower taxable income. certainly give dollars heirs thought every 22 min something ? It’s enough data nothing headline says inaccurate. alternatives, COVID ensemble seemed reliable. hampered 4 week projection.

Of models projecting 1 month, UCLA good set graphs cumulative daily projections going December 31st. 6-weeks projections good, mark Youyang Gu. trust numbers past 2 months, everybody looks terrible.

UCLA:  live CA wish would happen too. I’m sick burdened welfare states South. :) Liberals Florida, please, stay safe wear masks. can't cure stupid, covid can. else see except literal death cult? anyone give better interpretation? I'm confused plan. constitutes fast food constitutes restaurant laws. McDonalds slow service stay open? heads up, there’s near zero zinc zicam.  Washington State income tax. could either, depends state handling data. would admitting nightclubs sports events canceled long time. Layers part Google maps years. There's difference knowing use something working. Nope, I’m saying it’s ridiculous continue living like fatality rate low. would change way entire world works small demographic 5.2% fatality rate, top average infection rate around 5% among entire population? all. nuances cases rising/who cases hitting.

Edit: still gotten ur gotcha moment :/ Yeah, that's great subreddit. really great helping keep literature. Fauci flip flopper, he'll change answer again. Lol Yea fried chicken damn good though European strain spread Italy virulent, America's early infections came Chinese strain.

I believe NY got hit hard America got EU strain transatlantic flights. curious look damn self. Plus, asked evidence. ask anybody show him. God forbid someone wants keep retirement money. Agape! US. It’s everywhere. Yeah, read post along tweets, get sense want let model drift reality, didnt want tweak doomsday machine scare people. So, ended it. Forecasting mass death pretty morbid project end day. government fucking sucks fucked land free land fucked Get well soon! Hope bad case. Personally eye anything Trump government suspicion, looking countries confirmation. seems like life USA sacred rich powerful. America nothing children gunned classrooms, nothing hundreds thousands vulnerable dying. 

Of course, Americans feel like right, they're effectively held hostage right wing. end, effectively becomes result - lot dead innocents  probably brags much squat. young obese guys like hit gym throw weights bulk up. put head sand. busy empathy already it, kind souls reserving exclusively none. get mean, graphs show wave never gets back bottom.

technically yes, still first wave, third amplitude. Part 3 first story

its coming 1/3 1/2 peak heads back again. time goes reaches new peak.

all trump rallies going make fly. Death rate average around 7000 per week 2nd edition.. 3rd bring....... 2000 day again? agree you, would rather self-directed point rather government telling us do. part, think Canadians pretty smart. Mask adoption damn near 100% (about 1 hour Toronto) especially public indoor spaces. Maybe putting much faith collective intelligence perhaps. Yeah we're straight good time. tired idiots fighting reality. Even though wearing masks maintaining social distancing going make things worse, morons go suck ventilators. Nothing going convince gravity situation. keep family safe, deniers run around breath virus let nature take course. Why? beat Covid already economy booming. Fake News. work.

At least, PC/web version. ""layers"" button. quebec canada complete lockdown 900 cases 1 day. stupid people bias people running trials, look for, unconsciously sometimes, white males part. Women children also underrepresented trials. daughter's physician angry saw week, knew trials started children said vaccine would take longer, angry it. blame makes angry too. tell anyone family smiling masks on. worry basis reality, neither conclusions came disaster. People look back move like view McCarthyism today. DeSantis nutter totally failed job. consider statistical data showing shutdowns done anything stop slow spread find anti-contagion policies significantly and substantially slowed growth. policies different effects different populations, obtain consistent evidence policy packages deployed reduce rate transmission achieved large, beneficial measurable health outcomes. estimate across 6 countries, interventions prevented delayed order 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding averting approximately 495 million total infections "" 

""Our empirical results indicate large-scale anti-contagion policies slowed COVID-19 pandemic. infection rates countries studied would initially followed rapid exponential growth policies applied, results suggest policies provided large health benefits. example, estimate would approximately 465× observed number confirmed cases China, 17× number Italy 14× number United States end analysis large-scale anti-contagion policies estimate that—for countries consider here—current interventions sufficient drive *Rt* below 1 (probability *Rt* &lt; 1.0 greater 99%) achieve control epidemic. estimate across 11 countries combined, 12 15 million individuals infected SARS-CoV-2 4 May 2020, representing 3.2% 4.0% population. results show major non-pharmaceutical interventions—and lockdowns particular—have large effect reducing transmission. Continued intervention considered keep transmission SARS-CoV-2 overall containment strategy Hong Kong led stabilization number cases absence community-wide outbreak 4.5 first case reported. strategy containment might serve example future planning preparedness response novel infectious agents."" Whatever say buddy👍 good one. every country? Kind strange thing say. wrong Florida. Jeez. 

Also, death going spike time election misspelled smartest heard hoax. Gone last April. Like magic. current pneumonia cases cancer. I’m saying already making political issue tests. black white issue. would postulate maybe flu vaccine would stimulate secretion type interferons give protective effect similar recent discussion saw rhinovirus infection giving days protection coronavirus infections means stimulating secretion type interferons.

That would explain protective effect late flu season long vaccines administered. truly hope right, America we're much different position Australia in. concerned winter various reasons. Chief among fact we're taking way many infections fall winter. stated, pandemic fatigue really setting in. Mask usage declining lot places, people generally less cautious. leads believe may substantial influenza season compared southern hemisphere. large national election, numerous big holidays coming we'll lot large gatherings leading increased transmission. Unlike Australia, lockdowns coming save us. truly hope get fall winter minimal damage, I'm bracing worst. saving year order go back teaching person kids going back school. Anything may happen, best. Flu shots barely hurt. Getting blood drawn actually unpleasant, flu shot barely feel. Many travel take anything serious. tourism taxes like hotel car rental fees. states lack alternate taxes like oil tourism therefore must tax income. don’t care. Even Cain still avid supporter party. Jesus....this probably part thay scares most. heard chronic fatigue confusion lingering symptoms. Like....im already constantly tired confused, cant imagine adding mix Fauci suck taint. Let’s start tracking heart disease deaths every day like COVID. leadership conservative/racist people stupid. thats scary looking graph... US gonna suddenly level off.. gonna go bit  Good. healthier (raises good cholesterol lowering bad) tastier - stay solid room temperature bit like butter kneaded burger patty relatively chilled. Also cheaper buying Wagyu time buy fat use fat content burger (which contributes lot taste)

Give try - youtube channels show create patty scratch couple show adding Wagyu. Really upped home burger game. Blue doesnt equal smart. Neither red sometimes. Ah, sweet summer child. think people disagree ""Fauci"" suddenly get board ""Leading Experts""? financial stress isnt helping people fucking flu.

It never fucking flu.

It really, obviously, never, ever even close fucking flu. world exclusively populated 0-19 year olds huh? course. recovery 2008 hollow repo crisis last year proved. crashed market December 2018 raising rates 2.5%. alone clue us future monetary policy. crashing virus. damage done shut downs immense. Typical American exceptionalism. view world backwater can’t imagine nations control. 

That shown Vietnam second time. It’s lot American ego take really wish people would stop questioning damn vaccines.

When vaccine out, take it. Period. there’s one, get many can. Sure buddy,""no community transmission"",even though multiple experts various states stated otherwise. right masks Floridian here. live tourist town. bars restaurants remained full capacity. Rarely see anyone mask bars restaurants. work store required tell customers must wear mask. get pissed. Tell it’s ridiculous. Trump boat parade recently. 
TLDR: I’m moving. people downvoting you? literally true - Florida quickly becoming broke Congress nothing help unemployed Fauci truth teller entire administration. DeSantis trying make people think everything back normal certainly isn't. Unless you’re teacher, course.

Better?

/s  one least painful shots I've ever received. I've getting last 20 years never really issue besides maybe headache little fatigue day after. Two smart countries nasks4All late March. But, err, dropping mandates early July??? hospitalizations drastically reduced zero point restrictions all. point avoid excess death. Notice ICUs trending upward? enforce them. also means take scenario 5 figure 0-19 years (.00003) multiply 100 get what? lead poisoning obvious symptoms? remember reading story Mexican lead-glazed pottery poisoning family (iirc, served orange juice it), symptoms subtle. Hey genius, left ""either"" part decided add it. think busy trying pretend situation nuance. agree experts like Drs. Gupta Atlas, ignore overwhelming majority experts say suits believe. vast majority experts infectious disease can't change mind, rando reddit certainly going to. yes, pointless.

Yeah, I'll agree people correctly predicted would happen. whatever reason blindly believe read, even though proves wrong. Probably popular. That's think parts NYC experiencing ""large outbreak"". three images linked show completely ridiculous notion one attempt spread. can't believe tried can't even see NYC's data. vast majority experts infectious disease can't change mind, rando reddit certainly going to. yes, pointless.

Feels like cowering away. Whatever. still think wrong align people end right. Apparently align people estimated virus would ten twelve times worse actually ended being. 100% agree it’s running rampant country. really - $250,000 tax-deferred plan withdraw once, bump higher tax bracket (unless already highest one). generally better people funds available withdraw time. Everything response arbitrary half ass honestly even care anymore. aren’t even close level impact, caring stopping Covid mean don’t give fuck people dying flu.

Surely saving lives lockdowns measures flu, no? crippled world, killed far seriously set back almost every economy, perhaps even causing worldwide recession.

No, businesses forced shut people forced stay home that. 14 days extreme lockdown virus would gone.

You realize that'd never work, right? many things industry *need* stay running 24/7 starters. Check see app needs updated. Mine needed updated Google Playstore, reopened app there. factor, yes, would move on. that’s issue. 

1.	The virus highly contagious.
2.	Children spread virus teachers school staff families. 
3.	Teachers given shitty protection/supplies. 
4.	While survive virus, ones live issues: heart, lungs, brain, etc. 
5.	We know long-term effects virus survivors. Florida. Nice knowing Thank you, will.

I really feel you, wedding industry. something makes customers, especially brides, wicked worst way. Entitled bitches.

I can't belive much damage one stupid Maine wedding did. beyond sad Well everybody. city already there’s one left give you. takes large number immune people.  interpreting facial expression important part development learning empathy.

Kids still families TVs. fear masks kids lead increase sociopathic tendencies. 

That's somewhat ridiculous. hard kids use good hygiene.

Won't push get better it? Even not, argument *against* enforcing masks. What's special Wagyu fat? use regular fat? excess death rate far exceeds normal. I’m sure you’re getting at. sustainable. None it. Lift restrictions enforce manage hospital capacity there's growing trends. didn’t 55,000 cases yesterday? highest ever? house got it. fair black people country ton reasons distrustful make sad someone science politicized weaponized science much past one believes us emergency. i’m pretty sure i’ve one flu shot life still barely get sick. herd immunity? like one, 5 day country, totals daily, cases deaths.

Still doesnt completely smooth weekends though. going go one way. Good luck, Florida. also realise reading point advocating dystopia described, unlike users here. unnecessarily harsh. 

But may call false hope, think need try optimistic. Hope gotten people seemingly impossible situations, let pandemic end leave us stuck fatalist pessimistic worldview.

Humans survived black death, smallpox, Spanish flu. would dam right insulting let weaker virus undoing. good news. USA 2022 latest. Vaccine approved 300 million doses every county US?

Thats huge difference.  read article last month said enough vials, syringes, cold storage support covid vaccine. guess know 14 month timeline reference upcoming election nothing cutoff date become carbon neutral relationship climate model anywhere. 

The irony entire conversation attempt point logical fallacies actually exhibiting exact fallacies railing against. 

You address arguments would require agree act sense responsibility others undermines entire argument. instead call people stupid deflection. quite exercise mental gymnastics. made entire paragraph full hyperbole display ignorance climate scientists saying semblance historical context.

Our world keeps setting heat records, west coast fire, we've run names hurricanes many, setting regular records drought erratic weather patterns name couple obvious results climate change. Climate change weather like aided human activity weather like not. consensus hard-pressed find peer-reviewed academic research proving otherwise. 

My ""baseless senseless"" arguments using real claims made scientists, historical perspectives context, plain fact follow laws laws place people strictly consider others actions follow them. Google single one find backup claims scientific studies, history book teach start civilizations. Lookup ""hothouse earth,"" ""climate feedback loops"", ""permafrost melting"" find numerous studies worst trajectory possible making planet next uninhabitable species lest go underground. 

How would know? studied become history teacher requires extraordinary amount knowledge historical perspective pivoted instead becoming math teacher requires pragmatic approach based evidence statistics. Much dismay I'm sure, learn teach known casting aside theory I'm much fan saying ignorant bullshit. Looks like enjoy residing opposite side spectrum. 

This even argument. I'm talking wall point maybe someday learn make actual argument instead reading everyone else's reddit comments regurgitating thing. 

I'll happily respond actual argument present one. Perhaps Fauci might tell Florida (and everyone else) taking 50% vitamin medical maximum avoid getting sick. would concerned Florida. else remain lying hypocrite. relative like this. argument starts ""I respect mask choice, please give freedom make choice"" morphs ""besides, doctors want herd immunity right? I'd rather family deals sooner afraid, we'll part herd immunity protect you"" Funny worry FDA, innate vitamin levels, lack exposure sunlight, poor nutritional choices, poor lifestyle choices, obesity, smoking metabolic diseases among populations. Seems like would better place start. muh vaccines... flu does? strain cold? predict 20 years “COVID heart” driving factor heart disease among adults 35+ would thought primary concern department health would public health... they're particularly terrible it, that'd worrying. 

There much anyway regular individuals fail use common sense. kind tests independent. fail once, probably fail used right away individual. Love ya Time get drunk zoom Yes, easy enforce US, cops popular people love told do. Can't wait see police breaking x-mas gatherings toss people COVID prison they'll far safer holding cell 30 strangers, rather meeting family. racist group themselves, happens lot ""black"" doctors?

(If former, I'm sure I'd trust FDA...) Yeah.. moving problem one place another.

Everyone head friends place after-party.. 10pm's great time start after-party lockdown. passed UK long time ago that. UK death statistics load shit - covid died, classed covid death. 


My mother knows someone hit head died. found coronavirus after, classed covid death. Right. lost 40 lbs eating McDonald’s one twice weeks.  burger sipped coke small fry. Hi. suggested China might competent USA. thought I'd poke head over. How's everyone today?  Florida continues fuck nation over. needs lock back gets control again. population density NYC rapidly increase don’t lock down. time long term taxed rate.

No, short long term capital gains rates apply investments hold taxable accounts.

Money held tax-deferred accounts like traditional 401ks IRAs, 403b plans, SIMPLE IRAs, SEP-IRAs gets taxed ordinary federal income tax rates withdrawn. states, even state income taxes, give residents break they're withdrawing retirement account. know virus spreads 10pm  apologise hostile you. I've suffering badly isolation rude several users. 

I browse thread alot sort new, replies based replying me, big mystery there.

I'm subreddit discuss pandemic like everyone else. friends/family FL 20 comments ""WAVE 3 FINALLY HERE!!!"" post. one even remotely critical ""So, virus gone now?"". 

The amount people think big deal fucking astounding. 2020 taught anything country full fucking stupid, selfish, people. version herd immunity theory

What mean this? never read subreddit get one. info would interesting, thanks Captain America endorses message. "" INNA-051 compound works stimulating innate immune system, first line defence invasion pathogens body. boosting immune response way INNA-051 prior infection, ability COVID-19 virus infect animals replicate dramatically reduced PHE study showed. study provides evidence INNA-051 used stand-alone method antiviral preventative therapy, complementary vaccine programs. ""

&amp;#x200B;

This really bad, really bad science. want stimulating immune system weeks months worried exposure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Better shooting listering nose. Also obesity. India people verge starvation unlike Americans big deal. post purely political post. removed. nothing help us fight coronavirus. even reported you. It’s true American’s love using brute force solve problems. Unfortunately pandemics don’t care brutish are. Yeah, altruism nation-wide scale untenable country holds individualism core value. monetary incentives (or collective anger foreigners) us come together nation. Feels bad. people getting tired pandemic measures?

If want celebrate Christmas alone, go ahead means! individual. Households families would like come like, not, understand risk. 

If wind catching COVID, stay home isolate. anyone catch COVID literally anything; activities riskier others. flip side, activities important others. many, holidays important time get together, visit family, fun. We've already cancelled many holidays, understandable certain households would want rest.

People sick this. I'm downplaying severity virus. I'm stating objective facts. government issue many restrictions around holiday season like, still people going want celebrate. know DHHS specifically terrible public health, they've done well enough curb spread since August (of course advantage super strict lockdown). madness continues. people leaving bars 10pm create crowds streets public transport. even make sense. very, strict laws governing this. can't people agree - can't consent breaking law. Overruling laws rewriting would take far longer 4 months me. social life Yes USA entire world. Oh wait - isn’t!

My city 7 million hasn’t case several days - free fast testing available everyone. 

Is magic? based randomised testing testing likely symptomatic here? time people started saying sensible things like this, except: bother next year? 

It's clear Government can't handle without severely damaging general population. 

If sensible eradicate virus staying indoors (which isn't, one ever has), species would done that, would precedent it, guess what? That's reality. 

The bodies piling up, nothing lockdowns mask wearing (I'm rather bustling suburb really slow people go business feeding families lot can't work home - one wore mask first months, way). 

If want wait year see bodies piling up, guest. I'm guaranteed another year earth neither you.  Test 3 times. Chances 3 tests failing would 0.8%? (Assuming 80%)

If test positive any, get accurate one, saving time resources possibly.  DHHS Victoria copped crap load flack recently complains underfunding never ending right now. I’m bubbe.

Second all, may nothing holidays. dense? god trump destroyed country. would say covidiotism naturally occurring many parts world irrespective usa Finally trusting FDA??? could think thing?      /s Please check Brilacidin Innovation Pharmaceuticals killed 95% COVID19 human lung cell tissue RBL. Also Selectivity Index 300+. Combined Remdesivir killed 99.85 % viral load. Need EUA. Probably can't afford rent thanks man According article 2018, top two sources income state sales tax corporate income tax. Sales tax 26 billion, corporate income tax 2.2 billion. sales tax far biggest source income, 10x anything else.

Also, where's extra money banking back article written holidays? Trying find existing drug could order... Hmm.. Nope, Ena Respiratory said would ready test INNA-051 human trials less four months, subject successful toxicity studies regulatory approval.

but found article back We'll likely vaccine then, maybe help fight annual mutations. Holy smokes bars still open Paris? Probably want good stratified random sample population per good statistical practice. Worldometers (yet) appear showing major spike current baseline. Florida recorded 738 cases today, lowest many months, 80% lower Virus peak Lockdowns killing people. actually eating lot burger king *intentionally* impossible whopper... Impossible's meat analogues actually source heme iron vegetarian, actually contains twice much heme iron real need burgers, i'm vegetarian bleeding disorder iron always struggle me.

That said, I'm eating things *am* paying attention nutrition easy way get protein high quality form iron.

I also lost 30 pounds starting eat burger king impossible whoppers lot excess weight caused loss energy iron deficiency anemia. Neither peer reviewed controversial even scientific community. Anecdotes provide personal experience. adding political seems area anymore surprised me. I'm careful liberal friends. kids either people 40s.

Also, executive leadership countries similar factors seem help much so... feel people pass flu shot, vaccinations? I.o oh bgo we're YOLO pandemic

YOLOBNFL.

You live once, long. But. true. like jello currently covid positive florida seething cultists leave cult, get deprogrammed join normal people society. US gets new BinaxNow test Abbot, released sometime October also government contract 150 million units. 

Trump asshat, there's need make new shitty things he's many seen? surely Prime warehouse that's double speed conveyor belts? say anything thousands people? lockdown working slow spread leadership piss poor levels lost faith process. Picking choosing close rhyme reason really pissed Americans everyone saying fuck let’s see happens. guess we’ll find real quick. 

My daughter works restaurant Florida. said it’s like night-club atmosphere already. She’s already covid hopefully won’t get guess don’t even know sure. problem :) College scam morons days, drop out, save money time. Ah! Americans stupid, though. Gotta ramp COVID numbers time election. base loves big numbers. think means he's great job. That’s Indiana today kidding me? What's wrong sub. politicized bs.

All evidences virus lab made get suppressed, evidence tests produce inaccurate results get suppressed, speculation vaccine efficacy get left up. troll comment fine? problem good luck  gonna pop?  calling mods, lol? Look trolling, harassment, spreading misinformation. three three. Shows human life highly dependent politics, nothing else matters. Oh well culture too. strong leader would organized things polarized people best path. Americans probably stiff private liberty care unless leader really someone tap souls. Awesome! Funny it’s true! cannot admit weighed whether otherwise healthy person absolutely protected risk infection, place determining anything resembling strategy. Strategy risk, knowing is, isn't, knowing avoid risk invites, others, etc. Thousands Floridans driving 30 hours go state corona cases deaths. saw less 5? Probably rentals? 200k dead. bad place since start. Children lower quality life. feel sorry decision made self. Boo. Fucking. Hoo. hospitals overwhelmed see upwards 10% mortality. Assuming everyone got infected 140M deaths. one move government good kicking road we’re quickly running pavement. Yup: CVS too. many people need die give inkling fuck? It’s like florida lot old sickly people....wait FL now, lot people wearing masks that’s it. Looks like normal life again. Two weeks now: ""Second* Wave Hits Florida""

  * Yeah, actually still first. create ""covid flu"" video link whenever comment like appears? rat licker Governor. denying things happening? arguments overshadowed pile 200 thousand dead americans looming them. mean, make miserable? There's festival clubs, everything else open. *am* miserable miss dancing much, even open, probably go clubbing, worth risk. never real lockdown like Italy France China forbid people going outside, there's lots hiking routes. sure countries open borders better Germany... well aware then, right? couple friends PC ex-military, they'd beg differ. know talking about. Thank efforts doctor could setup situation whites getting vaccinated blacks not. one point, employers may require it. American race obsession fucking disturbing. insane false equivalency. Imagine mental gymnastics needed think way. Incredible. find simultaneously glad exists sad exist.

It exist medical ethics laws loose past. study designed compared similar study Oslo white participants, exact conditions, one informed. Also, black doctors participated US study, originator study meant provide treatment six months year, funding withdrawn experiment, resigned study extended.

Now, international medical ethics laws prohibit kind thing, rightly so, set discriminate Black people. created learn *better treat* Black people disease. Smart move. Nice. personal attack. 
You're reasonable arguments, suppose. might enjoy *joyous* years. Thanks Reddit censors. Fu8k that. It’s thanksgiving it’ll 8 months BS point no. Maybe Florida goes blue red team players sick home? 20,991 tests last 24 hours according Florida Department Health data released morning.  86,402 tests 9/18. amount tests administered dropping. normally make sure cutting boards clean?!😱 Oh, Florida... think lockdows costs lockdowns prevent single COVID-19 death.

No need strawman. Lockdown supporters nuanced know it. talk millions falling poverty food insecurity, thousands people die missed cancer screenings ones killing themselves, extra drug overdose etc etc... think specifically trust FDA regards approval COVID-19 vaccine, political issues/pressure them. Which, frankly, unwarranted - there's genuine concern respect prompted pharmaceutical companies say ""they would “stand science” put forward vaccine thoroughly vetted safety that, think sensible doubts FDA want independent body _remove_ politics. want care politicized, exactly kind thing _do_ want.  I'm American, I'm curious; move different state, change plates? FL plates belong current CA residents moved FL? No. leader something combat virus instead claiming would ""disappear like miracle"" would saved countless lives. Nope unfortunately Lol, went real sassy shutting fast person smacked evidence. Hey little boy, go outside play. Adults talking here. One parents works power plant. plant stockpiling food, hygiene items, cleaners months, ordered beds laundry machines. employees signed willing work 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off, skeleton staff, leaving plant all. Lollll good luck getting people listen Restaurants hire morons like though believe virus big deal. Can't control workers places. born smsadly lot retirement state. Florida would blue old folks coming voting without caring actual communities they're affecting - restrictions largely ignored, necessity - would Peru WORSE neighbors, fact worse EVERY COUNTRY WORLD? Tanzania enforce lockdowns/ended lockdown extremely early much hit hard early, almost knew facing (not still make unforgivable mistakes) -- also population density key factor. Also higher mortality rate developed treatments now. 

Population density poor excuse account urbanization. Florida's urban population Massachusetts'. Florida Arizona's urban populations greater New York Florida tougher restrictions populous counties state whole. bars Arizona recently allowed reopen still restrictions, sure citing glories 'lockdown'

Because cases declining despite restrictions. thing happened Sweden. cases spiraling control life mostly back normal vast majoritarian public health experts strongly back restrictions masks

How know vast majority do, vs ones get media attention? What's source this? positive rate tick up? 5% week now. decrease 6% You’re right, Italy universal care. would still expect correlation socioeconomic status actually getting flu shot, nearly strong US. mean, FDA, whoever's putting people power there, responsible politicization, thus less competent purpose? Would distrust order? zero evidence back claim speculation  Restaurants act prevent breakout establishment else.... poor business bad reputation. Incentives align. Yeah actually do. feel safer Shanghai elsewhere sure. Yeah. Getting 200 thousand americans killed wrong. take much spin... live Texas get it.

I don't. Texas property taxes house would exceed total state tax burden. live Hawaii, ""high tax"" state. Meh. gamble easily online sports / poker. need casino. I'm trying get flu shot 17 year old. Pharmacies give kids, doctor 45 miles away. 

I time gas money make 90 mile round trip. Everybody else house vaccinated. I'm hoping local pediatrician us. flu season right around corner, possible human body become immune adjusted COVID flu virus coats COVID prompt immune system tackle new foreign pathogen? COVID overpower way also affect flu pathogen? 

I know basic structure virus. There's poor scientific pre-prints use possibly bad antibody tests suggest much much higher number people infected think. called iceberg theory.

Some people take mean we're nearly full proper herd immunity. 

It comes conversation links r/COVID19 quite frequently factors community's understanding pandemic. totally unscientific.

However, much offer opinion something without journal article, get banned there. Yeah probably helps really like fries. love mashed potato consistency burger king onion rings eat those. think healthy least bit less starchy.

I would totally eat vegetarian KFC existed, they've done trial runs near live diet still safe that... ridiculous, attempting make something politicized something isn’t hasn’t made political. Good Tell 200 thousand dead families... still alive people there. Tons them. need pay bills.
I don’t agree reopening it’s easy say safe house fairly safe state (Ma) remote job kids remote learning, home, hefty savings, two incomes, insurance, etc.
Like judge someone wanting provide? survive? Actually many free state-run sites closed. know several people told must contact doctor get order test, like first cases appeared state. Hospitals overrun many new cases asymptomatic infections younger individuals usually face life-threatening complications. do, however, put risk ""long covid"" complications, DeSantis mention press briefings. stupid statement. Seems kinda racist.... non mask wearers TTC nowadays?

I left Toronto 6 weeks returned yesterday (great timing!), left pretty much everyone wearing mask ttc. moved 1.5 years ago N.E. - can't believe downright stupid people are...starting Gov! Yes, anti-vaxxer politics.

You still anti-vaxxer People stupid help businesses care money. Terrible idea. recent developments around administration, statements made, view horribly handled Coronavirus general overall teetering-on-the-brink-of-something-bad situation country. He's stating going leave peacefully. NY awaiting enough cases incarcerate him. owes $451m can't pay Russian mobsters co-signers. could keep writing day sadly.... Opinions? There's way would putting indoors bunch people hours. That's opinion. Oh
My
god lockdowns killed one million people? not, lockdowns successful reducing harm. 

If we're honest, lockdowns probably could ended several months ago more, certain people used common sense adhered basic, EASY precautions like rest us doing. refused reasons 100% selfish nothing actual evidence-based science. insisted going bars, restaurants churches without masks, insisting whole thing hoax. Many dead now, rest us still stuck lockdown mode behavior. it’s takes long time get sick die. roughly month average infection death (in April, may changed better treatment). 

Also needs time expand population. one person seeds infection community doubles every 5 days, takes weeks become problem. Plenty people already COVID explosive growth takes time kick in. 

6 weeks likely it’s hard say. work, harder measures required, people (quite understandably) pissed whole thing less likely comply eating animal products, processed foods, soda, working out, enough vitamin d? Underlying conditions 🙄

Start fasting eating 100% fruits, you’ll heal “viral detox” bad food choices soon enough... also anti-vaxxers intentionally. ignore it, forget it, don’t bother, aren’t necessarily. go way get one, get angry required get one, are.  agree 100% vaccines. I’m disputing that. all. I’m saying facetracked things? think can’t go (rightly so) don’t think can’t fly here. could wrong. call cryptic he's alluding measures need taken without a) proving actionable, implementable advice importantly, b) never setting forth quantifiable goals motivate actually sunset recommendations. right. military. even close. mathematician here, look  So, Turkish prison months June/July/August? Notice anything post labor day? lot places drive-thru shots year. I'm low key excited get one. study Italy though. got national healthcare, individuals paying plans? Isnt insulting POTUS? There's pallative treatments symptoms. Unlikely snowbirds normally go down?
I would guess like thanksgiving maybe year since families lot north east states aren’t comfortable gathering thanksgiving they’re like whatever let’s hit road get second home.
They may still safe reason stay nov like years?
I’m trying rationalize make sense it.

Like I’m hate cold almost anything nothing would bring now. I’m hoping guessing people second residence aren’t staring hotels etc. Peru - restrictions largely ignored, necessity  - hit hard early, almost knew facing (not still make unforgivable mistakes) -- also population density key factor. Also higher mortality rate developed treatments now. 

IIRC Florida tougher restrictions populous counties state whole. bars [Arizona recently allowed still restrictions, sure citing glories 'lockdown'

The vast majoritarian public health experts strongly back restrictions masks - argue want. I'll take advice CDC, WHO, country health professionals random counterviews. Maybe right, presented compelling case listened vast majority health care community, simple fact want believe her.

Look, agree full lockdowns necessary, know anyone advocating that. mask mandates, restricted seatings restaurants, crowding bars theaters - need outlier opinions convince folks good ideas. Lets assume 3 percent people US contract die Covid19. 328.2 million people US. estimated 94% population must immune interrupt chain transmission. math. hope so, thanks! 😊 Sounds like we're back UnderCover Brother w/Smart Brother(s) taking stand. Riiiight.......

We still done first wave Feel better soon!!! standard denialist attack line. Denialism killing people *right now*. \*Shaun Atwood entered chat\* IL? I’m curious. talking vacationers, say retired folks place Florida (north east).
If drive down, go condo house whatever, get things delivered etc, take precautions.
Is big deal? see people older Retired folks rushing place early since lot working parents know trying get retired parents help virtual school daycare.
What they’re trying get early. true problem vacationers/short term renters going eat vacation stuff?
I hope I’m making sense. understand distrust, I'm following current logic.

Imagine hundred years chinese doctors experimented conducted sorts testing white people, including giving syphilis see would happen vivisecting people sport later on.

Now flash forward today china says coronavac safe tested tens thousands people offering you. Would take given coming people experimented people like hundred years cruel sadistic manner? another reason many people angry right now., feel like realistic options. Opening 100% rescinding mask social distancing mandates protect workforce. population large would commit masks distancing, would least help mitigate viral transmission little bit since obvious open places entire economy going collapse. Going gung ho like inviting even chaos, especially since lot people seem care health well fellow humans. Literally 14 days extreme lockdown virus would gone.

This neither true feasible. fact wear mask. 😂😂😂 Sure, do. cover hand ask want watch. fail read wrote?

I literally explained exact thing. Perhaps making attempt understanding words might help future. first happen really bad flu seasons. third also happen due flu. reason minorities every single country world represented types tests? realize dumb look there’s literally hundreds data points collectively prove it’s definitely not?  underestimating much 1% chance death matters; dealing large numbers 1% ends lot. something similar happened 5% mortality rate, could frame ""95% chance surviving,"" still sound bad, effects would apocalyptic scale. FDA run companies meant regulate. Company CEO's higher ups often take 'hiatus ' company pending food/drug coming approval go work FDA said thing approved. oversight this. common place pharmaceutical companies biggest offenders. So, no, FDA extremely trustworthy. Worked fine iOS Oh another video Floridians morons pandemic...I’m  herd mentality! That’ll happen. It’ll happen. never realistic tell bunch industries shutdown years. Saying would keep shelter place guidelines years made support go way down. 2021 see states start opening wide open vaccine accepted death come it. never said normal, necessary bring virus control. countries choosing live it, own. Oh. growing again.

Would-ya look that. heard ton coworkers say Friday. First time I’d heard express sentiment. Must new wave disinfo. Kinda funny coz didnt realize whole world election year rn /s You’re super fucking guilty politicizing btw. 

Here’s need worry about. data safety/efficacy look good? sufficiently peer reviewed? people like Fauci Birx agree? passes three tests yeah, you’re irresponsible refusing take unless it’s distributed democratic administration.

You’re anti vaxxer Jesus you’re towing line 200,000 dead, way. problem self centered prick.  There’s already riots happening everything else going wrong country! Today overrun hospitals, tomorrow overrun morgue.

The feds passed stimulus till senate part since Feb 2020. know “heat map” is? That's call Deathsantis. sooo much like Jaws. shocked!! could happen??!! American dream cruel farce???!! can't believe democrats would this. Hopefully Trump drain swamp next term. normal, pandemic good example might bad. Significantly less, majority us. Because, society, faced underlying issues still see consequences today. Someone linked survey many doctors expressed Blacks feel level pain. That's one ways Tuskegee experiments manifest today. There's bottle water right next him, couple pictures show long mask down. GG Yes, except sellers AliExpress uptick occurring alongside higher plateau testing moving average. know looking at. testing goes positivity still ticks that's good thing. SOP constituency social Darwinism. abate concern expectation magic/miracles, idea there's unknown good suffering allow part unknowable plan. year would take ten days 1 million people die around world. Stuck (florida) training, 7pm sunday every bar drove packed. I'm hoping make state alive.  resort fees Orlando hotels fucking racket tell hwat. 20-30% going sweet fuck terms herd immunity fucking hate born every attempt escaped wretched state keeps ending failure debt coulda gotten that, cup coffee! Yep peoples far important actual people. many us work full time pay rent. I'm bot think covid overblown fuck So, work die, money. 

I think pandemic stay vaccines gonna panacea hoping for. every time there’s single day cases high even single state see headline???? east America gets. That's lot worry about. Yes, pandemic revealed lot life really means people, values community. 

You must missing boyfriend much. seen kids grandkids since March 6. really hard support networks get stretched thin, murder death, sorry losses.

Be extra kind traumatic time. make permanent decisions anything one, temporarily decisions help watch skin. i’ve following india all. first real mention them, they’re surpass u.s. major reasons?


(like, something, stopping something?) surprised states Governor Trumpet.  people keep this?    maybe is. would rewrite headline? comparing two agencies are. comparable . pick apart budget , funding distribution, salaries, cultural community issues , etc.. posts directed toward NYPD officers, civilians feeling effects 10 fold right need support bitching . want see real changes nypd talk spending budget get involved entire process Don’t mind them. Anyone disagrees locking everything end time labeled sociopath terrible person ever China? guys don’t wear masks, nothing said. doesn’t make sense would listen first time suddenly listen now.

They morons. “freedom” right wing politics told masks bad.  moved Colorado California Jan California wildfires. Covid we're thinking leaving United States moving Canada. there's major disaster US its' going fall apart. Look Katrina... Look Covid. US government barely functional Hey, I'm medical patient, agree! even weren't, I'd still agree! Another poster thread explains suffered unwanted weight gain due medical issues.

Should they, someone similar situation, take ""part blame, it"" prolonged side effects Covid-19, unlucky enough caught it?

(Btw, proviso 'if it' included really mean blame, else include it?) literally pointed cities Florida Arizona restrictions, bars closed months Arizona (recently reopened) say ""They restrictions!""

Bars closed mean people still socializing though? want invoke Sweden? death rate far higher Scandinavian countries. 

[Their mortality rate year comparable past 2019 unusually low number deaths leading larger usual vulnerable population. people died corona little time left, we're talking months, years. Swedes approve government's response.

Peru hand strict, early, prolonged lockdowns ended HIGHER death rate neighbors, rest no, city Florida Arizona match NYC's population density. Miami's population density 13,500 per square mile. NYC 27,000. Cross river Union City, NJ, 54,000. way, Phoenix 3,100. please, tell they're same. 

I'm talking NYC's mortality rate. I'm talking NY state. [More people live cities Florida Arizona that's fact. explained Connecticut Massachusetts they're TV country pleading people listen

TV depends drawing viewers. Alarmist headlines sell, ""everything fine"" doesn't. experts get appear media represent name city county head health experts saying ""Nothing worry about, we're immune, put away masks pack dance floor!""

Literally right saying go back 100% normal, they're saying take *age-targeted approach* focus protecting elderly rather shutting society indiscriminately putting restrictions everyone. means letting young people live lives normal according experts  know what? think possible hate for-profit healthcare more, find can. Imagine someone getting Placebo accidentally catching Covid right after. Can't hide effectively failing democratic state like rising totalitarian state. run president? Sounds like someone never heard Tuskegee Experiment lasted well 1970's ok.

I definitely see people keen taking vaccine developed quickly governmental administration actively working interests since inauguration. Yolo County. Mask usage probably 90% county many businesses remain shut down. widely criticized first shut one last counties California open up.  Dumb Dumber really. that's far I'm willing go here. never forget *[there's horse loose everywhere. Nothing shutting ever again. even schools. Stock Market up. means economy back booming... *eyes roll head Hi, Texas here. We're 75% capacity. Thankfully Austin mask mandate still. :/ Profits people. Wins every time. mean, mad people using logic here? state-wide mandate masks never got issued, governor threatened crack local governments trying issue mandates, everything opening back including Didney Whorl. can't really say ""the US failing wearing masks social distancing"" also saying ""Florida's right, numbers going down"". makes sense. either numbers fudged actually going down, rest world wrong acting like happen all. makes sense you?  Florida Man* I'm anticipating HARD winter... We're going covid related deaths suicides too. going hardest winter US long long long time. Probably since Dec 1943 (WWII) you? I’m also Northern California almost everything open (with restrictions cases) months Yeah, bored worth children dying. 
 
Stay classy. current political climate. certainly help, there's lot (bad) history minority communities medicine trials. [Dr Tuskegee experiments two examples happened USA territory. likely right now. feels like cold. I’m young healthy. haven’t left house get tested 6 days likely 5-10 do.

Novel cold flu virus contributed empires falling extermination whole cultures.

These people cannot see beyond shitty amoral people.  Recent head injuries?  Amen Sounds like leftwing hoax tbh reason.

It's obvious why? Lol Man white people really went fucking crazy Obama winning, huh? [Coronavirus Vince Mcmahon] would nice. bad current administration scrapped Michelle’s nutrition guidelines schools earlier year. birthday less.  rly are. full “hold beer” moments comes stupidity. wish could transport family there. feel really sorry people US moment, particularly states like Florida. like governments care all.

Hopefully, November guys get hope! *Sugar water never really did. exempted quarter state statewide mandates pointless testing lagged reporting inaccurate know area hot spot weeks fact. kind shitty proxy genotyping. worry, field dead soon. replaced mathematically similar, scientifically superior, alternative. logic, fear example idiotic choice. people disgusting. 🤮 least could opened state enforced mask mandate statewide. No. triples fully reopening, publicly declaring mask mandates unenforceable, suggesting college students shouldn’t punished partying. Also cutting testing nursing homes patients staff. think texas giving run money. Sure lifted -all- restrictions, starting happen people act like there's restrictions either way. 

Besides 75% fire capacity = 100% customer capacity....

Good luck you. May craziest state *win?* ! Wrong kind shots Florida. Wrong kind shots :( point, death seems way lot ignorant and/or moronic people country learn pandemic still here. pray sane families Florida &amp; everywhere else within currently (figuratively &amp; literally)dying country. reasonable. Wear masks, practice social distancing wherever go wash hands. Wish CA would follow. Staying closed indefinitely bad plan. best! think know that? no, someone keeping last term signals they're inside! Warn racist, choose side! Florida's cray Yeah, I'm also CA I'm tired lockdowns end sight. ur joking right

a little thing called money exists I’m anti masker say need every day life might catch flu ridiculous fear make people feel uneasy time necessary help gun violence./s That's 3k across US, Northeast March, going fine. Seriously. Right 14,000 people died state 6 months. That’s like September 11th deaths 5 times. would avoided common sense. Naysayers looove bring flu. Florida lost 3100 people flu last year 12 months. 14,000 dead SIX MONTHS. FLU! mean, puts scallops pizza? Vietnam.... recycle shit 8.5 million people die globally hunger year, 600k malaria, 1.2 million diarrhea (500k deaths children). Every single year. easily preventable deaths caused poverty. Poverty kills, unsurprisingly none overnight public health crusaders seem give much damn people dying it. 1.5 million deaths zero mitigation. mitigation predicted 100k 200k year's end. We're pace shatter that. know even how, I've seen before. Usually fancy cars, maybe ship somehow? arguing lifting restrictions shows danger healthcare system? Party Garth! percentage overweight people medical issues contribute weight issues? comment here: pretty extensive Chinese sources (I'd guess 10 people I'm semi-regular communication with). Things back normal there. months (since like April? May?), even Hubei &amp; Wuhan. Live CA... Hope also soon optimistic. understand covid doubter make political.

There assumption theres debate, debate exists. can't debate 1+1=3

I think fauci expert, he's somebody take seriously health issues, proven great advice. dare use facts. lean slightly left sick overreaction CA. Definitely voting every Democrat state. Staying shut indefinitely bad plan. even move US? Last time checked US population wasn’t allowed lot countries. Please explain us said. Thanks u know, hate smart*** like humor cleverness shall gift something (if im able to) Ottawa, Canada, gets cold see neighbors till March. Or... could started testing two months earlier, cut red tape prevented private labs adding resources fight, developed contact tracing program, discredited masks.

I reckon could saved 100,000 lives, $1.5 trillion stimulus, kept 12 million people jobs.

But hey, set discredited science name cigarette profits fossil fuel profits reaping benefits. Amazing 60 years campaigning sow doubt do. 

At point, even point lockdowns? lockdown, open back up, we’ve done bought time. Time develop execute long term plan? Nah, time hope goes away hope vaccine shows soon. 

We’ve got probably five months vaccine shows up. good options anymore. 
Maybe I’d less pessimistic didn’t live Florida. screwed bad. We've various ""experts"" predict US 1.5m deaths end year, trust predictions low. happened considerable cluster never quarantined (maybe did, first two three weeks), coupled a, opinion, awful handling critical weeks back March. remember watching people pouring international airport minor issue. thorough controlling whatsoever. also specifically remember flimsy standing signs regarding covid. admit less known back easier say now, still. also help Argentina's version Fauci claiming ""this cold"" ""it never reach country.""

Just seconds worth thought. Guess can't getting tests bullshit. antibody tests simply work all, PCR tests literally say package COVID. person village - 3 kids + husband tested negative using PCR test got, way. literally nothing like China. There's ""24/7 social surveillance"".

I've China (and likely go back COVID lets GF wants visit family), dating PRC citizen (and years), dated another PRC citizen (I live area very, high concentration Chinese grad students), 我说一点点中文. made several friends language learning two girls. short, American, know China pretty well.

The ""social credit system"" see freak articles time time? really thing. Chinese people ask (including GF) - semi-frequently Reddit tends freak - absolutely clue talking about. mean might turn something eventually, right now? essentially exist.

Criticize China crappy things actually do, like camps Xinjiang, oppression Hong Kong. attacking things they're even comes ignorant xenophobic. Pretty sure 3k hospitals able handle them.. forget hospitals activities covid? gotta deal crap too. did? responsible eat much move, hence weight.

I cannot judge veracity post mention, can't say anything it. Sure gain weight due medical problem responsible - goes extremely overweight. Correct use 9/11 example event united country. Yes debate war necessary, amount humanity shown ( sending relief New York victims, even Canada receiving American bound planes housing thoes passengers) something astonishing. Yet deaths hospitals, war fought nurses doctors, people want ignore large amount, human life economic damage, could avoided. Look ""Map Details"". overlays (""layers"") actual map. stores little town central Florida good requiring masks part people complying. went Walmart today, mandatory-mask signs taken one way isles. believe it. know idiot waved mandates, thought stores own. 

I guess wrong. fucked. think pandemic stay vaccines gonna panacea hoping for.

Not doctor, vaccines garbage, made stage 3 trials. think. Apparently you’re supposed use new condom time. went theory condoms cause pregnancies... Honestly dude, hope right, I'm wrong. I'm going people know they're talking say. *laughs 90k daily cases* attitudes toward virus restrictions necessarily left right. Fauci retire. America rejected plan.   nope. Florida treasury surplus gdeficit. fucked bald guy was, stinginess left us full coffers. you’re head Corona Virus task force perhaps ought attend baseball game (that one else attend) example proper behavior solidarity make sacrifices Covid. Yup... looking cases misleading number. yeah basically (hopefully quickly?) evolve less virulent, less damaging.  People stopped it.

The absence logic covid something I'm understanding pause rent, mortgage, etc 2 mths, give people money food stuff, ask people stay home weeks? 

Announce plenty warning people buy stuff. Limit amounts things person buy per day, hoarding. 

Then mass testing area area, restricting travel untested tested safe areas, sending infected people quarantine? 

Boom, weed sick ones, healthy people get reinfected, sick people get treatment gets severe?

Give docs treating infected really good PPE stay healthy. says measures? I'm sincerely interested flipping fingers lot countries (the one live really shitty condition society stupidity ""France"") Yeah I’m really conflicted, live Florida work 2 jobs bartender, one restaurant one bar. one hand really want go back making money again, hand seems completely irresponsible bosses jobs whatever get business. know it’s tough times us feel like sacrificing general well us get business back normal. Given US that's becomes world's biggest liar manipulator yes believe things coming China. definitely contained virus 10000x better West. clear even think numbers exactly accurate. Sinophobe could pretend that's case  both. I’m CA though. Plan voting trump well Democrats CA. Keeping state shut indefinitely bad plan. really shutting though, it? 
it's taking good precautions go around kill another 100k people.

the restaurants live (and city) making possible sit people outside, accomodating pretty well.

if stay poorly ventilated place sick people hours, chances going get much severe case (because initial viral load).

1% 1 million people ten thousand people. quite big toll, affecting people, still destroyed economy end. Dad? Bad, bad idea. Well responsible eat exercise not. Unless force-fed unable move. herd insanity.

Even mid next year there's decent vaccine, people start thinking fuck need live life... still excuse socialize safely.

You always wear mask, always practice great hygiene. much protect others.

I'm honestly starting come around logic that, covid exist? flu still dangerous, maybe always practicing lot shit. Interesting 401ks invented give corporations way incentivize executive recruitment. Prior 401ks, everyone would get corporate pension. 401ks created company could say prospective executive, ""in addition pension, also get tax advantaged retirement account corp contribute behalf! ""

Eventually, corps saw great tax advantaged nature 401k *their* books, started slowly moving regular employees made ineligible pension. 

See, corps like pensions. put lot money one, retired employees guaranteed certain amount. tough run one, federal guidelines pension invest in, shortfall cash make pension payments, make cash general funds (which means profit go shareholders).

As corps moved people pensions 401ks, bottom lines started getting much better. That's stock market tear since 80s.

That's Gen X virtually Millenials pension. Companies offer anymore.

By way, signed company's 401k? haven't, should. put much max company's match (if one). Otherwise leaving *your* compensation table. Yup... Believe people Florida don’t want shut down.

I think agree idea ""we cannot let cure worse problem itself!""

However, disagreement along party lines worse.

Some say shattered economy, psychological problems, domestic violence, postponed surgeries, etc. cause deaths Covid. say don't. say reduced traffic reduces deaths, reduced stress reduces deaths, reduced number pneumonia cases reduces deaths, etc. say people dying Covid dead anyways pandemic over. way could get reliable numbers excess deaths years life lost beforehand.

China first country reopen economy, virus less control, shows economic outlook.

The USA may second country reopen, becomes first achieve herd immunity, enough vaccines available.

Organs may affected by COVID-19 include:

- **Heart.** Imaging tests taken months recovery from COVID-19 have shown **lasting damage heart muscle, even people experienced mild COVID-19 symptoms.** **may increase risk heart failure heart complications** future.

- **Lungs.** The type pneumonia often associated with COVID-19 can cause **long-standing damage** tiny air sacs (alveoli) lungs. resulting scar tissue lead **long-term breathing problems.**

- **Brain.** **Even young people,** COVID-19 can cause **strokes, seizures Guillain-Barre syndrome** — condition causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also **increase risk developing Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease.**

**Blood clots blood vessel problems**

COVID-19 can make blood cells likely clump form clots. large clots cause heart attacks strokes, much heart damage caused by COVID-19 is believed stem small clots block tiny blood vessels (capillaries) heart muscle.

Other organs affected blood clots include lungs, legs, liver kidneys. COVID-19 can also weaken blood vessels, **contributes potentially long-lasting problems liver kidneys.**

[All information taken Mayo list lingering maladies COVID-19 longer varied doctors could imagined. Ongoing problems include fatigue, racing heartbeat, shortness breath, achy joints, foggy thinking, persistent loss sense smell, damage heart, lungs, kidneys, brain.

**Pain lingers**
A subset COVID-19 patients experiences ongoing symptoms complications organ damage, and researchers proposing reasons some of (bottom). Scientists trying identify suchsymptoms, common are, long last,who’s risk, treat prevent them.

**1 Brain fog**
Difficulty thinking occur acute COVID-19 infection. virus may damage brain cells, inflammation brain body may also cause neurologic complications. viral infections also lead brain fog.

**2 Shortness breath**
Doctors eyeing lung heart complications including scarring. Patients become critically ill COVID-19 seem likely lingering shortness breath, **those mildcases also risk.**

**3 Heart arrhythmia**
The virus harm heart, doctors concerned long-term damage. How heart heals after COVID-19 could help determine whether a patient develops an irregular heartbeat.

**4 Hypertension**
Some patients high blood pressure acute infection, **even cases relatively mild people previously healthy,** possibly virus targets bloodvessels heart cells.

The virus ravages heart, example, multiple ways. Direct invasion heart cells damage destroy them. Massive inflammation affect cardiac function. virus blunt function ACE2 receptors, normally help protect heart cells degrade angiotensin II, hormone increases blood pressure. Stress body fighting virus prompt release adrenaline epinephrine, also “have deleterious effect heart,” says Raul Mitrani, cardiac electrophysiologist University Miami collaborates Goldberger.

But patients affected without apparent risk factors: paper week in JAMA Cardiology found 78 100 people diagnosed COVID-19 cardiac abnormalities heart imaged average 10 weeks later, often inflammation heart muscle. Many participants study previously healthy, even caught virus ski trips, according authors.

Collectively, “long-haulers” describe dozens symptoms, including many could multiple causes, fatigue, joint pain, fever. “It’s time give voice huge population patients,” Akrami says ... Iwasaki especially struck number **young, healthy, active people**—people like Akrami—who fall long-hauler category. others struggle find ways help them, wonders might head symptoms.

How much better? Well, still kind unknown right now? Yes, studies, think ""duh"" redditors aware them. 

[I found interesting article said masks may responsible 1-2% reduction daily growth rate, post-mandate also findings people using eye coverings fewer infections?

Doesn't mask filter potentially infected saliva droplets? Like, kind come mouth talking? That's point, right?

Look, wear mask wear right, truthful. lie people encourage compliance. Words mean things, word ""equivalent"" problematic context likely objectively wrong. consider number cases 500 day couple weeks ago. It’s steadily rising since then, much, enough 2000+ new cases per day. 
Additionally, case numbers pretty much every European country increasing. worriedly looking especially Spain France, numbers reached - least regions - pretty dramatic level. Almost day, new European region added list travel warnings issued government. fall winter coming, means Germany weather cold, wet disgusting, events that, now, could take place outside, take place inside, likely lead cases. So, answer question: don’t think Germany overreacting. number factors favor right now, Germany trying prevent exponential growth threatening. Cloth contours pretty well. Mine folds sewn curves chin nose wire contours nose cheeks stays up. simple design. couple inches larger smaller either direction, matter long covers face mouth leave gap, fine.

Anyway... saying Confirmation Bias.... Ok, feel canceling rent mortgages, universal health care, state wide meals program households weather covid without financial burden? high percentage infected people get chronic issues. no, sense yet whether fatigue sufferers smell-losers ever recover.

I know either true. example know several smell-losers recovered couple weeks/months. Sturgis, you? Well prodded past eliminate possibility infection/inflammation lungs right now. I'm saying people assuming every sickness covid important remember many diseases still going around treatable caught, cause severe health issues left fester. you’re hoping new case explosion? That’s good analogy long. week ten days. wasn’t hospitalized hanging home. didn’t even feel bad - super tired like couldn’t breath. cough fever. Still able small projects around house cook myself.

Except restaurants mass gatherings, people small group. places limit seem like sound public policy, especially light economic impacts restaurant workers owners. think people aren’t gathering - actually gathering, numerous people speaking one another, etc. general space - spaces aren’t restaurants, like private homes.

You might try less condescending tone future interactions. rely insults perceived superiority isn’t good look. mostly agree everything said, think applies majority people. 

But also think fear mongering statement holds. I've seen CNN outlets changing opinions based new data even offering reasonable analysis currently available data. pick choose report, report it, report it, specific slant towards negative.

For specific example, weeks ago sub, article posted young people die Covid, too. specifically pointing younger healthcare workers ""without pre-existing conditions"". cherry picked handful young medical workers died used headline intro make sound like common place, lied pre-existing condition part.

Its common. never was, never be. doubly bad every single example gave obese people. know unless went specifically digging stories, did. 

These articles made top sub repeatedly, peddling information, misinformation, lack information, many comments peddling fear, many comments pointed rare obese often downvoted called covid deniers. 

That's sort thing angers people spreads misinformation. people realize every little bit misinformation hurts cause, causes people tune out. 

This study here, one we're commenting on? I'm automatically assuming cherry picked bullshit. assumed going link, clicked it, proven correct. study linked, ""side effects"" vague undefined, study done online, 83.3% people asked respond bother. pretty good job stirring fear pot here. 

Its simple fact vast majority people fine disease, people contract *won't even know it*. show symptoms, many shrug mild. true many brutal week two, fine afterwards. yes, long term effects, including organ scarring scary things... try feed people 90 long term problems deliberately deceitful. 

I'm just... frustrated wish us could real reporting this. media lies us. professionals lied us (remember masks important first months this?) everyone scared, part reason fear many people prepared stoke flames much can. Ha! Jokes you. can't breathe nose. still wear mask though; because, know, I'm dick care community.

But know they're trying say, roll eyes bullshit. Thanks, sure head one. know full well makes masks ineffective, call people *degenerative* chimping out

oof, racist term never heard that. say going overrule laws policies bypass safety measures? Pretty condescending? He’s literally correct.. better wear mouth mask all. That’s pretty fucking obvious using common sense. Mouth covered better mouth covered.

So infuriating we’re trying return normalcy, won’t return normalcy order get infected covid? making sense? right-wing politically driven disinformation campaign. idea mods allow belief began circulating months ago conservative news programs like Rush Limbaugh Laura Ingraham. cited several times Dr. Scott W.

[Unfortunately seemed , social distancing practiced religious gatherings. Real answer - wear properly see least 1 person - I’m one aisle, it’s mainly supposed protect others - I’ll pull nose, someone comes aisle see someone.

The logic tells - ok, it’s protect others ones around I’m grabbing take - can’t pull nose minute I’m alone??

Edit: guess realize - technically nobody knows - that’s I’m asking question - I’ve heard question asked - approach ok? say likely. said fact.

Yet past cannot undone. Locking continuing lockdowns help virus giant foothold already economy crumbling pieces. govt barely gave everyone $1200, can't give everyone $10K+ required lock months that's ignoring psychology locking even now.

It actions past led dilemma grim. South Korea reopened now, mostly safely. countries may accomplished it. that's question. question _what left now._ governments around world looking stark data, they're thinking lock again, thinking ""we can't afford stay shut."" Hey, here. girlfriend sick March. I’ve since undiagnosed gastrointestinal issue that’s ER two separate stints, first May recently beginning month. haven’t connected issue COVID way don’t assume result it. times throwing anything consumed extreme states fatigue week lost 22 pounds first time 15 pounds second time. 

However, ER May ended getting x-rays found scarring architecture right lung never before, least aware of. also dealt fatigue shortness breath since March. physical activity feels strenuous, work construction every day challenge wasn’t case past years I’ve field. I’m 22 btw always good physical shape. I’ve generally fatigued much outside work, I’ve seeking leave house much anyways due COVID still actively spread community.

I agree cases big person cast pov healthcare professional overweight already taking care yourself. really amazing think sees blatant gaslighting. can't believe people can't figure one own. clarify, say “chronic fatigue” literally always tired. didn’t fit typical profile someone diagnosed cfs exhaustion symptom had. still able go work, pretty much exhausted time didn’t energy bare minimum. 

I went multiple doctors course 2 years luck eliminated food triggers, started seeing holistic doctor put bunch supplements.

It’s like wearing meshed underwear diarrhea It’s mostly young people becoming infected atm. mote severe cases (seeking care) actually increased. See figure 1 trend somewhat worrying, long increases cases primarily among young, won’t see dramatic increase deaths. know one believes ""ourbreak tracing,"" right? people openly supporting crowds BLM protests invalidated credibility. 

Stop defending authoritarianism. Covid Karens eat shit share place. That's why. wake every morning decide day.

We stick people like island learn means part society. experience like mine. read Reddit you’d believe everyone sitting home. wear mask everytime leave house, wont wear seat belt tho casualty wearing seat belt fascist. cut Complete garbage post. ""study"" online survey. However, close near end august though since cases reported discos-related.

Common sense government beautiful thing. Shutting places people getting infected seems like obvious step take yet many governments won’t it. Yes wearing like sociopaths don’t believe science scream maybe shoot say anything. People scared need cops enforce busy feeling hurt getting trouble murdering people It’s data interpreted

That literally called science fun! Sounds like they’re someone would benefit wearing mask properly though. Corona would feel worse. 

If you’re gonna wear nose, point wearing really. Indeed hard enforce legal recourse never truly know years passed Man, one Cool J already. think bird liked must BTW got double sided tape, stick nose press mask face.

 mean, really ? 

Have look following Good point . rhymes generation people 50s 60s often blamed worlds problems.

This. votes mattered trump president right now. [it maybe wish media loves blame everything Covid instead crappy reaction That's way many treated Also, sky blue. Here's video map showing virus spread across US past 7 clorox wipes hold freezer? Nobody died lockdown, course. Lockdowns even reduced all-cause mortality. Every five people died covid UK, two counted covid victims insufficient testing later data doctoring. well known UK one embarrassing underestimates covid deaths Western world. view consider remotely valid ""it affects everyone take chances..."" selfish view, least understand perspective. idea true.  like NYC Spain first wave terms deaths?

You need get debate, need defend positions, least talk it, mention believe crazy conspiracy theories.


This stuff spreads part nobody wants tell crazy person they're crazy, leads others realizing they're crazy believing them.


If want radical fringe opinions disregard reality, let act like crazy person trying defend position. let silence rational voice. current administration seizes power somehow wins election absolutely consider vaccine safe take on

This politicizing issue. research, trials, peer review process removed enough presidency one becomes available nuts get it. That's said remarks flirting anti-vax Nah seal hatch end time course do. come broken homes neighborhoods equal war zones Middle East. also young adults .

That emulate phone desktop. know sure over?? everyone tries math covid always take current infections assume occur? Sputnik still tested. Essential workers (doctors, teachers etc) received vaccine (although lots decline fear) That's lot words say, ""Other people's lives worth slightest inconvenience."" Pretty stupid take impression pulling nose least preferable mask. guess not, good point. may stop wearing glasses around people honestly. Given current situation think mask critical safety.  paragraph actually... ""Now we've passed grim milestone still losing around 1,000 people day, Donald Trump acknowledged—bragged—to Bob Woodward last winter knew COVID deadly airborne, many Trump-lovers starting look factual information virus""

what part ""bullshit rhetoric"" setting aside questions CDC ""hijinks"", death outcome, contagion death contagion

but know that. pretend don't. excellent Epidemiologist Rod Jackson explains Infection Fatality Proportion likely 1%, may high 2%. earlier studies larger smaller numbers flawed due small sample sizes. Sweden keeps making astonishingly bad decisions. Like *consistently* fuck badly? conspiracy theory civil made worse Florida purpose comes time vote suddenly state crises, voting postponed resaults election delayed. may know lot less viruses exactly qualified judge holistic benefits suppression lockdowns either.

You may, I'm disease intervention specialist government. know plenty viruses. destroy global economy normal society. costs high I'm sure worth it. 

No, free change economic structure happen. I'm stopping you. speculative terrible effects recession coming

Doesn't one. 

At end day, choosing lazily gamble virus, plenty evidence easily could, harm entire generation humans, want deal little societal change. point rather talk recession massive resulting deaths, change society. .. comments section article arguing evidence never shut down! OMG. People truly insane. Four right wing nutters make square I'm going need rundown logic here. cold flu increase person spreading covid asymptomatic people? person without covid symptoms could spread without knowing about. person sick cold flu symptoms likely stay home, no? Wut? get ableton assemble videos found footage friends send you...there made better artist. Next. pre peer review? unless field, pre peer review studies ignored. Dr still mistakenly believe white people feel pain give less pain medicaiton problem black people:

Racial bias pain assessment treatment recommendations, false beliefs biological differences blacks research shown that, relative white patients, black patients less likely given pain medications and, given pain medications, receive lower quantities (1⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–10). example, retrospective study, Todd et al. (10) found black patients significantly less likely white patients receive analgesics extremity fractures emergency room (57% vs. 74%), despite similar self-reports pain. disparity pain treatment true even among young children. instance, study nearly one million children diagnosed appendicitis revealed that, relative white patients, black patients less likely receive pain medication moderate pain less likely receive opioids—the appropriate treatment—for severe pain disparities pain treatment could reflect overprescription medications white patients, underprescription medications black patients, or, likely, both. Indeed, evidence overprescription issue, also clear evidence underprescription pain medications black patients real, documented phenomenon (1, 4). example, study examining pain management among patients metastatic recurrent cancer found 35% racial minority patients received appropriate prescriptions—as established World Health Organization guidelines—compared 50% nonminority patients (4). Ever look mirror? Mmmm herd immunity working great eh Sweden? Absolutley fantastically.

1500 cases Sweden roughly 45 000 cases US btw. get idea dire things getting. extraordinary head state also scientist. theory US refusing work country that’s trying develop vaccine refuse accept vaccine developed another country (for example, sister overheard mom watching CNN months back talking Russia designing vaccine “to use invade us take control” horrible is. sisters reaction “isn’t development vaccine GOOD thing??”). 

So US release vaccine people. lot people speculated even vaccine ready, like, now, Trump won’t release vaccine RIGHT election convince undecided voters he’s big hero saved world scary Chinese virus it’ll fresh minds go polls. 

Most people US also seem assume vaccine released virus magically disappear moment. old cunt still waffling on? clearly infected with.... *some*thing Keeping USA #1 always Trumps priority. Seriously. point, they're better reality denying anti-maskers covid hoaxers.

STOP FUCKING DENYING REALITY. got mine last check-up. opening stadiums, interesting see goes stats november month. really surprised topic survived long, politics relationship whatsoever course virus 

/s election weeks away, timing sketchy. strategy suppress vote? party’s voters likely skip quarantine go polls election day they’re sick? Yeah, live Palm Beach County, feel though pretty smart this, compared rest Florida, anyway. look excess deaths, pandemic already killed one 500 Peruvians far. that's fairly young country... Governing bodies way voted in. US testing corpses. stopped testing people see died would deaths countries Europe. /s lol, koolaid must tasty Social distancing no, noticed (very) small around NFL players wearing masks means anything you. % positive dumbest stat. course it’s high people getting tested aren’t sick. Maybe make everyone get test every day % clearly lower. vaccine unlikely eradicate disease. flu still exists, measles still exists, etc.

You say virus ""could lead entire generation decade lower life expectancy host medical conditions"". highly speculative. speculative terrible effects recession coming up. well established recessions shorten life spans, lower health outcomes, degrade peoples quality life significantly. justify propose need prove consequences lockdown suppression less damaging long term consequences recession. seen anyone provide evidence.

You asking everyone gamble vaccine probably little mitigate illness, similar flu vaccine, destroy global economy normal society. costs high I'm sure worth it. 

Especially propose actions, certain virologist epidiomologists, absolutely qualifications economy, food supply lines, political legal ramifications measures, etc. highly specialised yet somehow qualified dictate society governed. 

Politicians, may know lot less viruses exactly qualified judge holistic benefits suppression lockdowns either. wonder country mess lol. Merkel hardly power ""the public machine"" though. like US lots top government officials presidential appointees. went airport ready protect 'full respirator goggles'.... stood line get airport food remove equipment consume? definitely misspoke, know Jason works Boot Barn posted FB would November 4th. anyone think come time vote suddenly Florida crises voting waite therefore stalling results election? could consider fact obese overweight people sick tired every health problem blamed weight point ignored condescended doctors years end. course gonna wanna hear doctors routinely dismiss pain weight. Growth still seems linear, that's good thing. People like hear truth sub. board 12 months lockdown, denier lot peoples' eyes. care reality. would essentially solve crisis proves effective enough. Stop acting like they're walking room infecting people without knowing. participants would know risks enrolling would ample opportunity opt out. point challenge study quickly prove effectiveness, possibly years fast would normally occur without one. I'm saying right thing do, also think looking naïve mindset, save people: finding effective vaccine quick possible waiting proven trial error next year+ spikes continue take lives knowingly take risk. easy show full responsible. Let take example USA one country one higgest obesity rate. grew environment see obese people told normal body Form, got corn syrup quite cheap food, many fruits legumes genetically modified, etc... moment, eat healthy know need grew environment?


Other examples, France. 30 years ago, Europe, one lowest obesity overweight rate. 1h30-2h eating every midday, quite every parents cooked children, culture garden fresh products, fast food taught bad food eat exceptionally, many industrial food, enough money buy fresh products (and expensive market). 

In 30 minutes eating, industrial products cheaper fresh products, usually poorer biggest part population overweight obese. rate obesity double triple past years.

So say me, responsible external factors bring that? Tell cruise ship customers country state run people deny science reject evidence favour conspiracy, money stupidity. Hasn’t starker contrast political parties long time. Third wave? second? honestly thought States we're still dealing first wave COVID-19. said reason moving US government barely functional, specifically what's going Boulder.

Johns Hopkins' tally shows US, Brazil, India Mexico account 50% deaths worldwide. mean, I'm black I'm glad panel exists trust FDA reasons. know, whole politicization thing. Republicans trying break system good Biden. muck block everything can’t fix it. absolutely wrong. No, don't. even remotely. selfish ""me me"" attitude, never safety nets needed.

I definitely don’t want drag out, I’ve ever made comment normalcy returning within year mean US only. probably made positive comment good things quarantine, overall it’s still quarantine blows. response completely pathetic, feel confident rest world (I’m assuming you’re stuck US) back normal OK way are, feel pretty good could next year whenever vaccines start coming out. 

Thank apologize calling many times. many trolls brigaders lately, I’ve 5 try harass getting shadow banned local Reddit following around trying cause problems. It’s stressful days getting crazy sometimes hateful comments DMs them, suspect someone might trying troll makes wary. Clearly you’re one I’ll keep mind future, apologies again! not? educated well enough know would love know. Possibly. need see actually happen. won’t know sure month now. hospital visits stay low/get lower, assume it’s control. I’d go back up, still problem. can't derive point comment? believe you. EXTREMELY easy derive point comment. am, people barely go winter. Indeed, start pandemic, still winter weather, believe made easier people stay in. 20 states holding steady comes average daily new cases compared last week, 23 reporting more: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin Wyoming.

Seven states show downward trends new cases -- Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Rhode Island, Texas Virginia. USA #1!! USA #1!!  see virus really do. government doesn’t care. get tested regularly. rich, create safety amount money have. poor mans pandemic one coming save us. No, people need income pay bills, need bills. country actually prioritized needs citizens instead ensuring constant profit corporations owner class problem.

If argument people need work fulfilled, myriad ways people productive involve going shitty job hate anyways. UBI studies shown people forced waste time stupid jobs actually end creative, make art, become entrepreneurs. need define enrichment? covid 19 old man rubber mask? Glad top comment. subreddit filled headline readers don’t go farther that. man human race realllly fuking dumb. 😂🤣😅😂🤣😃😅😄 understand evidence coronavirus transmitted food. detailed FAQ food safety available general precaution, produce soak warm water consumption, including vegetables fruits peel (such bananas).

No evidence, soak produce? saying covering mouth nose nothing lessen viral load spreading? worry Trump used DPA ensure adequate hotdogs fourth. people fall ""normal range"" neither high low, good question!! doesn’t sound right since pharmacies let pharmacists this. understand able see tiny pills markings near impossible mask nose, still. fact right wing twisted stories science scream ""HERD IMMUNITY 20%!!!111"" change proven epidemiology herd immunity could well achievable lower rates...at least, given definition herd immunity.

The thing is, R care going down. Whether due social distancing, masks, via herd immunity. suppose initial outbreak got 20%. started wearing masks social distancing, that, combined herd immunity, brought R almost 1. Tick infected threshold 25%, R 1. Boom. got covid control.

Step social distancing gas, R starts increasing again. end 30%, makes R go 1 again. Boom. control.

Step gas more. R increases again. 40% threshold, R 1. on. forth.

But here's thing. People willing social distance months. Plenty evidence, especially China, suggests antibodies last longer first seemed, plus there's B cells cells think of. immunity might last longer. 

All beyond NYC article told you: superspreaders likely immune first. think “beating system” 5 Indian cities 6 times population NZ amount cognitive dissonance types people able muster must sight behold. absolutely ability tell difference political stunt global pandemic. troops deployed border protect America immigrant caravan completely disappears news day election, that's political stunt. global pandemic already killed 200,000+ Americans 1,000,000 people globally, clearly political stunt.

I wonder they're going feel vote Republican virus magically disappear day election. I'm sure they'll fine. cognitive dissonance help them. Either Trump wins forget statements losses start blaming Democrats whole mess. need wash hands wipe wash ass either... talked mom months randomly said last week checking her. asked thinks would go away Nov 3 said go ended conversation short. lives Florida I'm worried her. Likely already underrepresented vaccine studies. would find out? Self-report surveys common across research field involving humans. take account analyzing data, comparing studies. Exactly lol people crying app yet country takes 1000 dead day never thought people would struggle much something simple. Whack mole goddamn mole farm right. dangerous older generation immunocompromised. going argue that. stepdad goes bladder cancer surgery two days. someone needs careful. is. kids able see that. reason kids can't go school dance see friends Pop Pop risk. means see Pop Pop. one I'm making point previous comment imprecise nonsense. large shark species eat fish squid. there's little else big shark eat ocean. 

Basking sharks large exception. actually 0.1%, quite bit lower that. According table 3 report OP posted, .004% age 0 34, .06% 35 44. think guy responding kinda used 0.1% estimate. Well Indian people take rules restrictions lightly.

Meh, gonna die virus, badass /s Oh promise huh? Well makes everything better, I'm glad people top it. Irish, German Italian jokes UK, go? OK let explain simply. 

If natural herd immunity impossible means virus produce lasting immune response humans. case vaccine cannot work relies mechanisms. understand now? 

If point spit instead accusing constructing strawman (which wasn't). proven cases reinfection. 

we idea common presently is, might change time. hate “Christian” relatives ones peddle line thinking. Like, oh yeah, Jesus, famous giving shit sick people. definitely scares most. Check subreddit r/covid19positive. people long term symptoms. There's many people like this, many young we're healthy/active Indoor completely optional social events low rate mask wearing people legit eating drinking dancing vs outdoor high rate mask usage social action.

They shit. Maybe covid, maybe still lasting infection pulmonologist find. Even though covid around diseases stop existing. That's better public believing scientists anything... I'll take it... Lmao give dude... embarassing Staff tested too, players + staff people suggesting method means get covid?

because people want go back bars normal life soon possible, even happens maximum number deaths suffering first. 

Seriously, really break saying, that's basically it. “Out abundance caution, NFL everything possible play game weekend. need money”. - NFL probably thinking right now. Go asshole monkeys! Seems like good handle subject. Would able provide reputable study showing every time get sick shortens lifespan? I've heard Swedes, government power institute national lockdown, might overriding reason didn't.

That said, still find hilarious people think Sweden's strategy could ever worked country like US they're far less socially responsible cohesive. one things we're learning virus. side effects recovery lead temporary even chronic issues.

The acute phase pandemic tip iceberg.

Wear mask, wash hands. Convince others same. data appear say cells provide plenty protection, 100% certain. also less tech-savvy, adblock free easy solution honestly can't understand everyone using it. also, ""you're taking money content creators"" people show up, percentage ad revenue content creators get really minuscule, supporting exploitive advertising agencies, really want support fav creators, send buck PayPal/Patreon buy merch them, helps way more. true- would difficult discern exactly causing fatigue, people probably answer survey yes, fatigue, regardless actually covid something else. fear mongering It’s correct though... droplets fly mouth talk cause virus spread. covering mouth help stop spread, obviously cover nose too.

Do arguments contrary blowing little steam right now? controversial pardoning someone spent decades helping Putin topple democracies, threatened witnesses judge US trial, says publicly COULD taken Trump down, chose instead protect refusing divulge info FBI, called federal government seize ballots states cannot count them? seeing controversy supporters that.

Nice comment removed pretense repost.

So long keep pretending public health catastrophe unfolding around us directly influenced political agendas squarely odds, public health, hundreds thousands continue die needlessly, ""patriots"" supporting president continue drive spread dismissing valid public health guidance ""fake news.""

Turns out...  gaslight deadly.

They two separate issues. US single worst outbreak earth Trump's misinformation. that's saying natural herd immunity possible giving examples. 

that saying people temporary immunity infection. saying all. 

I suspect trying beat straw man, distorted version argument address actual argument. well yeah, always established overweight good without covid. get healthier may go away. think sleep apnea never thinner. pointing fingers anything fact ate many Pringles COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 pure respiratory virus although got name attacking lungs people. seems vascular disease attacking specific receptors (called ACE2). receptors organs (lung, heart, liver, kidney, etc) that’s people kind weird side affects doctors don’t even connect COVID, knowledge changing quickly there’s really one-stop-information website (at least know of). It’s hard date. two friends also experience hair loss body, severe mild case, respectively. seems like there’s autoimmune response associated it. 
I’m doctor either, article quite helpful me: [We though Covid-19 respiratory virus - say exact rather analogy sides agents whatever large corporations/agencies feel best represent interests. Emotions easiest manipulate hence, example, post. see survey speculating questions asked? Spreading misinformation promote narrative isn’t helpful. Leaders come say shame rest. Whoa, whoa there, *way* much reasoning logic! know first rule religion think yourself? told older woman cover nose protect herself. rolled eyes kept trucking by.
Idiots gonna idiot. Sorry mate, sent huge response assumption would travelling EU US passport.

Please take random Redditer's word gold :) Italian passport holder citizen, trouble getting back in. would imagine asked self-isolate 2 weeks. know I'm allowed come go US UK back British Residence Permit allows access UK American passport allows access US.

Anytime questions I've emailed US embassy London (where live) - could probably reach Italian embassy US / customer page Italian government site assistance. long flights US Italy, theoretically allowed go ""home."" long bed/out action for? Endurance doesnt last forever bedridden. mean I'll immune future reinfection produce antibodies? want say quiet part loud. would rather call people names.

American businesses put profits people. businesses stay shut down, bunch fail. millionaire owners get new Lear Jet year. lives saved, including lives business owners families.

GREED driving COVID response, *humanity*.

Quite frankly cannot give two fucking shits Chili's franchise.

Instead whining ""human nature"" maybe directing efforts towards worked countries:
Pay people stay home social distance. Make sure health care taken away. 

Right wing politicians say cannot pay people like do, return work. THAT'S FUCKING POINT, *want people stay home* stay home disease can't spread!

If one good thing disease done, helped rip veil false notion care one another. Apparently lot us give shit anyone ourselves. sickening. actually think travelling, huddling together, changing moist locker room isnt going spread weekly grocery shop mask? (Which sure, isnt even done them).
Well, part reason states turmoil. 

***""WOO! U.S.A. #1!!""***

You're also lunch think MILLION DOLLAR EARNING FOOTBALL PLAYER, one AFFORDING 10,000$(""free"") covid tests.. 

Yes, proven US citizenship; selfish, ignorant jollies you.

I watch canada, willfully ignorant ship sinks us. WTF? said sharks vegetarians? Thankfully, least bell curve, people fall closer center... guess surge business hoaxers. /s sortof lot also fake news coming random sources labourers recieved saying buses arranged take hometowns. absolutely do. They're lazy entitled fucks. Deaths dont ""lag"" cases anymore.

You find plenty examples places cases went whatever reason deaths never followed. I’m coddling adults know better. It’s flaw I’m sorry Confirmation Bias qualitative quantitative. survey phrased ""are lingering effects Covid 19?"" likely draw far different crowd saying ""Did Covid-19"" look low response rate, clearly full-proof representation likely struggled going take time answer survey. except everyone medical problems. keeps happening, teams might designate alternative practice facilities case main facility compromised.

At least NFL proactive taking issue seriously. you’re going say, “uh oh immunity short SARS-2 it’s short seasonal Coronaviruses” it’s worth point original SARS-1 years immunity.

Making comparison seasonal coronaviruses ignoring immune response see SARS MERS, far closer related structured COVID common old strains, kinda dumb.

It may short, may long, saying it’s short seasonal ones short immunity 2 bad Coronaviruses long immunity hiding half puzzle

Edit: understand supposed scholarly, actually think article like totally ignores SARS MERS honestly unprofessional. live US county that's taking seriously since started we're definitely perfect, majority businesses enforcing masks restaurants eliminated indoor dining greatly expanded outdoor dining lots spaced tables. infections deaths remained stable relatively low considering population.  


I went town county south us pretty much pretending COVID exist swear difference night day. Packed restaurants, far fewer masks, distancing. surprising infections almost kept pace despite fact less half population. He’s supposed lead example. Fauci looks like touch bureaucrat attending game. brags big deal. every republican governor said “hey bad need help” would think would help pressure congress president. haven’t even tried are. New York sucks I’m glad excuse cancel trip year   guess so. I'd comfortable article study pointed to, even depth explanation experts got quotes from.

Obviously wearing properly much better mouth, buy thay mouth covering 100% useless, maybe 90 95%. nose sticking mask awful look. sure Orthodox, know Hasidic community essentially denies science straight don’t give fuck pandemic. don’t think know better tbh

Edit: I’m talking Europe, think lot people uninformed least face. Saw guy wearing top head, straps around ears.

Agreed, mask wearing might around next summer, restrictions gone. equivalent holding ramblings weird guy corner train gospel can't stand foolishness kids health. know long term effects parents purposely sending children school Covid-19 possibly putting kids risk. overhyped, lots people still die, need ICU long. right dangerous parents/grandparents.

We sort things impose sorts burdens people, long-term, reduce car accident fatalities. example:

Speed limits, seat belts, road improvements, drunk driving checkpoints, driving tests, licensing possible loss license, DMV eye exams, car manufacturing safety inspections, faulty car recalls, airbags, mandatory car insurance, driver's education training getting driver's education get caught moving violation, civil lawsuits wronged party, etc. afraid needle covid/flu mega mix? Novel flu viruses contained. *3* flu pandemics 20th century. 2 particularly notable, killing ~1m each, H1N1, one seasonal flus today, first showed 1918...it caused pandemic killed 50,000,000 2 years. Right.

So, again: Working supersedes health safety. 

We get it: Slave away otherwise corporations can't make money - government assist time that's corporate masters want.

They thinking new regulations though. I'm getting married 10th October even though I'll probably directly affected new regulations, still pretty good here. Also, companies chill corona. Like, already talked owner location move party later date cost even technically allowed party want take risk. Right.

This things done together.

By consolidating infected one area, free PPE areas used one sick area. 

How consolidate? lockdown focus testing one group. enough testing everybody? again, focus one group. Testing FAST. use example Hong Kong, tested 1.75million people two weeks. Turnaround time test results within day. 

Remove sick people group, limit travel untested people group get reinfected. 

This way scheduled planned time landlords mortgages, budget raise specific funds for, instead throwing money bottomless pit.

Even collectivist people, get year really restricting life. hit year point, hard pressed find maybe 10% people willing sacrifice normal life.

You get year, that’s point haven’t figured end it, you’re probably past point restrictions good harm anymore Got flu shot, i'm gtg won’t give already bro, everyone knows you’re troll weird consider neither side knows anything swedish strategy. reacting think sweden doing. would entail slightly controversial pardon, but, hey, prob! mechanism traditionally role ‘acquired respectability’.

Well said regional hospital obviously there's smaller surrounding hospitals well. mention hospitals rivals local cooperating together.

Wonder following around thread? Engage arguments comment. immunity SARS?

what it? gave examples immunity last long. 

Again, know. Stop acting like know sure.  clear im left myself. 

The ""problem"" Sweden better many UK lockdown countries left (in US mainly) pushing narrative Sweden horrible. thats true think need switch tactic, aknowledge better US Swedish leftish society. leftish tactic. 

Sweden probably social democratic tactic whole world weird become right US using positive example. god mother pneumonia COVID. Idk old she’s definitely 60+ she’s fine now. scary 2 episodes abut recovered fully.

That said, I’ve continued wear face coverings nose ever since, directed. 

My guess it’s comfort thing. 

I don’t know solution make adherence better. It’s become political issue since last Spring.

So, peaks repeated geographically, also repeat temporally - every 2-3 months - till eventually everyone country got COVID - whether asymptomatic(40-50%), mild/moderate severe (10%). predicted early experts - repeating peaks multiple ""waves"". dude dismisses 2 Nature papers claiming peer-reviewed, uses USAtoday source. clearly understand works. Stop trying push political opinions shield ""medical consesus"", idea talking about. Kate Brown Oregon allow large gatherings vaccine place. Oregon one lowest states 181 cases per day yet portland still phase 1, places basically locked still.

I think people understand controlling state governors are. It’s ongoing tragedy. Things get lot worse people acknowledge there’s even problem.

As seen, hit personally. way things going, eventually - affecting hundreds thousands lives.

And yeah, get it. Economic situation bad. It’s like living different economy them. rest us responding like there’s global pandemic happening, sooner properly, sooner business get back track.

But know I’m preaching choir. Reason really took dive last years. Atlantic posted great article complicated get workable vaccine public. accepting restrictions going right way probably least end 2021. Aha, famous herd immunity favored authoritarians despots. Quickly infect kill large part population go business making money It’s almost nose connected respiratory system something like that? we've 40,000 cases day fair though side effects. lasting impacts. Wow. Almost everything stated false. wife easily winded recovering COVID trouble maintaining blood sugar. 110 lbs. got nothing weight.

It won’t stop everyone, casual/lazy ones get message. Oh man, imagine rebuttal “So ...you think whole world election year us or..?” look faces getting asked. It’s even worse. wasn’t even shortage, wanted maintainability export capacity prices Yeah I’m reading  I'm vehemently lock-downs heavy-headed government regulations. people try suppress information way regarding relative danger virus, sure call out. Well different risk categories. Casual contact stuff world 2 3 people might touched different elevator used hundreds clothes COVID ward. Sturgis traced lot outbreaks large gatherings saloons. far things mentioned, know. state Democratic run, allow things mentioned. Begs question. continue educate historical events, society, derive almost zero benefit understanding our/others prior mistakes? Go back read comment dunce. I'll paste obviously lazy, stupid, February obviously lied. There's reason dozens studies come touting efficacy masks.

Show said that. Go ahead. I'll wait. Well...hopefully......these decisions Florida may results orderers wishing for!!!! say 40% Cardiac injury correct.

That's accurate correct assumption based data. fear mongering. sub especially, people spread wildest unsupported conspiracy theories zero shame. I'll never forget way grandfathers fought Nazi's sitting crowded bar pretending war real. that's patriotism. 

Oh wait, nutted sacrificed country world, unlike generation conservative snowflakes came everything given greatest generation squandered rest us. So, experiencing fatigue inability focus properly 5 days now. I'm going get antibody test done, two common side-effects virus.

My antigen test negative last month.

There three types tests - '**IgG Antibody**', '**IgG+IgM Antibody**', '**Antibody Total**'.

Which one get? He’s right, experts saying that. say April vaccine widespread effectively drop restrictions stuff, mostly pandemic almost certainly going end social level shitting me, know 30+ people it???? How? Im central Europe whenever someone mentions knowing one person immediate feeling horror. 

Also: everyone ok? rough anyone? Sounds like guys got lucky, thats awesome!!! They're not? Dining rooms open southern states little social distancing. That's parking lots packed. “Why pretending it’s over?”

Because decisions elected officials making. Enough Floridians want way rest population just.... deal it. 

It’s unfortunate that’s literally reason why. never state mask mandate, county mandates

President says states take care themselves.

State governor says counties take care themselves.

The tragedy commons gets worse worse. swear would cry happy tears statewide mask mandate here. tiring going walmart seeing 60% people wearing masks wearing incorrectly. want much rest yall pretending doesnt exist doesnt help either, end like million people.  Law manages keep people smoking public buildings 🤷‍♀️ COURSE SICK IT! irresponsible twat ignoring problem solution Honestly, could give af people comment whether good bad, troll wanted tell story bit. uncle American; Peruvian Peru right high contagion rate although death rate horrible say States. know uncle wrong mean bad person miss terribly. yes, heartless people give af. condolences father; can't imagine losing mom dad already lost uncle grandfather COVID grandfather 96 already full blown dementia. COVID contributing factor unfortunately. year done nothing kick rear keep going.... far exceptionally rare problem tough avoid politics. getting another stimulus bill means people longer stay home get exposed example. also local governments forced stupid things like survive well Well......heres dilemma DAY 1...there many hospital beds/personal ventilators. you(or mom granddad maybe) want treated PROPERLY get bad, can't overwhelm system .... give fuck wanna let people die get bad, Florida doing!! trouble sleeping side, sometimes feels like I'm suffocating. overweight, used much heavier yet problems. hit miss. see point also, people held hostage though virus isn’t bad county. People following protocol mitigating spread businesses still remain closed open restrictions. 

I guess point incompetent governments sides aisle. That’s frustration many Northern California counties followed guidelines low case load whole thing. 

Their incompetence seeing progress Covid made, almost everyone following CDC guidelines yet remain shut and/or open restrictions. can’t ways. Total BS people comply?

Here's example today: Yeah there's still plenty community transmission happening can't trace. basically personal contacts made room, think tracing would successful is. really sad possibly crazy guy 4chan gives information that's accurate CDC. careful interpret kind data. Especially symptoms like fatigue problems concentrating (both 25% cases) nocebo effect.

From experience dealing doctors, everything nocebo ""you're imagining"" start uncontrollably consistently puking blood apple-sized tumor shows somewhere you. I'm sure that's accounted for. Well good hard cry morning. feel defeated, depressed, filled anxiety.

My family gathering Thanksgiving, there’s nothing say stop them. includes taking seriously following every precaution.

They’re coming 6 different states, driving, flying. four 90+ year olds there, others high risk. Guest rooms full several sharing space futons stuff too.

I’ve never felt powerless life. I’m praying things either get way better Thanksgiving CDC strongly encourages people stay home changes hearts minds.

Failing that, I’m ordering air purifiers now, looking personal air conditioning units. Anything else think could bolster safety? Trying control things still control point. hope trump gets dies. 0.1% 160 million 160.000. everybody got it, 160 thousand young(ish) people would like 3 times USA lost Vietnam yeah USE ought devote 3 times ressources fighting covid fighting Vietnam. 

lol. turned paper argument I'd give D. initial guys don’t wear masks, nothing said.

You somehow strawmanned say **I said lie affect mask wearing**

Stop lying. thought second saline allergy spray would trick.

I know tested local hospital seems yielding positive results controlled trial [a carrageenan nasal study published yet. leaders don’t care life. care money. Capitalism ftw O, “anti vaxx” cool black doctor? I'm sorry ask, work lobotomites? video outright telling falsehood. saying masks work general public simultaneously trying secure masks healthcare workers lie omission. certainly affected people's trust medical experts. Darwin's law full force. Men take Covid seriously able reproduce. men think Covid fake news lack critical thinking skills genes stopped. 

During last pandemic, scientists noted overall effect healthier population. Covid give us healthier smarter. nothing nocebo tho. Nocebo negative outlooks treatment impacting said treatment (e.g. cancer patients terminally ill believing treatment help). study do, part, psychological impact psychosomatic manifestations covid. 

I back June, much harder part dealing psychological stress virus point killed 500k people matter months. stress lingered awhile afterwards. physically mentally exhausting (or me). Actually personally know people one died abroad could argue opposite. system broken thats why, country lot laws basically ""in faith"" followed everyone, billionaires get effected non jail legal battle, rioting every major city, protests left right, political parties seem black white.

This could said *any* virus. think covid like data circulating viral strains?

The answer big no. Ever since trump took control cdc, numbers coming place. Mondays sundays numbers even reported next day. Something fishy this, especially considering ever I'm hearing acquaintances acquaintances getting covid ever. website people list providers companies compliant mask mandates people know ahead time avoid them. It’s like wearing pants dick hanging top them. I'm glad ""experts"" concluded this. would never figured otherwise. (italy) actually back normality, everything open, june mid-august (nightclubs included). However, close near end august though since cases reported discos-related. political? seems like factual statement
“America's first COVID death February 29 year, roughly 200 days ago. time, 200,000 Americans died disease, equivalent 1,000 people day.”  report yesterday India doubled cases less month. Trumps direction coronavirus like nascar, ""there taking left turn!"" sure *hope* one tries closing schools two years, never know instance like this. could done? something police start fixing enforcement. cultural problem. 

It's like know ticketed speeding, still it. People states mask rules know problem (*hey, recognize username another forum - hello fellow Michigander!*), who's going anything it? Since get trouble, not? 

We selfish. us, personally I'm good mask wearing, enough us think we're rules near impossible enforce short accepting full police state, may worse. ""if""????? Soooo. iron deficiency issues could eat less 1400 day still gain weight. things really wreck metabolism people know about, reason doctors check for. truly believe condition call *lack intelligence* ah, poor middle class value taken them? people least afford it? honestly think NFL hasn’t planned every possible outcome? It’s profitable sports league world.

Buddy, based amount incompetence I've seen otherwise reputable organizations past months (even ignoring governmental organizations), genuinely would slightest bit surprised NFL fully thought contingency plan this.  Ya smug Swedes expect pushback. CDC long-term tracking 10,000 randomly selected Americans get accurate statistics instead dumbass meta reports highly scewed selection population. Duh, Captain Obvi...oh wait. people thought alone watching hidden camera? 🤔 Nic Cage 'You say' meme hand, provided evidence random factors affecting disease severity. Well anecdotal example, I've talking dad apparently forgets mask 90% time goes out, bother go back get it. go like, keys wallet phone mask, okay ready go. care part wearing mask important. many people concerned guess. think deliberate rebellion anything like that. usually carelessness ignorance.

That said, I've met people refused wear masks pure spite. exist. think people.

Also, think easy society feel detached major events feel like behavior need change based them. read news Russia invaded country North Korea threatening world again, aside fact know information, life changed. think psychologically, might disconnect people told actually make conscious effort do. know, idea. Take tinfoil hat make mandatory like Turkey. wear mask police gives hefty fine. works guess better sick burned fire. black white outcome

Yes. One impacted other. two columns: “deaths involving COVID19 excluding flu” “deaths flu excluding COVID19”. Add up. Outdoors make big impact. factors make situation safer are: outside, masks, six feet apart, lack continuous exposure. ways make family gathering safer, think point family gathering people traveling different areas indoors, close together, extended period time, pose risk. countries enacted lockdowns virus spread - even regions countries enacted lockdowns virus spread, southern Italy - overall mortality went normal. indirect excess mortality countries regions heavily hit covid, people unable receive treatment hospitals already full covid patients.

Not single person United States denied medical care hospitals full coronavirus patients. outright lie. brings consolation. However training employees.  I've tried that, plus masks wire bridges tissue. still get fogging. I'm selfish enough pull mask nose, sympathy glasses wearers solutions always work. Sometimes think it’s accident. know mine fallen nose I’ve adjust before. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Yeah, I'd call 91.1% symptoms 16.7% responding, 15.2% reported symptoms surveyed class -- 2 every 13. symptoms may responded, certainly likely effects responded even get imprecise survey answers ""fatigue"" noted. protest vote, go walmart vote, go get lottery tickets vote, go beach vote. conspiracy basic common sense laziness people care go vote regardless voting for. sides issues getting base get vote starts registration tell know many register hate jury duty. couple hours too, avoiding anywhere near IL-WI border. cluster communities. Also pretty MN-WI border towns like La Crosse. good source. early pandemic PPE shortages full swing even understand virus spread well, course lot HCW would infected. even published/peer-reviewed paper, blog post Indian economic think tank tell? Furthermore, article said 90% HCW COVID-19 hospitalized, means predominantly get severe disease. conclude infectious dose impact disease severity? really support saying all... face shields anything all? restroom doors open inside?

I think due fire safety laws. like wearing boxers letting dick hang also talk face shields?

They're good masks (also depending design oc) (depening live) count face coverings, live made fabric.

Yet see staff stores customers well wearing mask face shields even tiny hardly covering anything one bats eye.

Sure, physically demanding work wearing mask might hard, justify face shields. They're fine additional protection course replace mask. Told ya! mean theres literally diffrence opening mouth. Jesus people, dont need expert tell that. fact even need experts tell us pretty sad.  video talks teachers able give child test sniffles. 150 million tests really enough used liberally? I’m understanding correctly, single use tests, right? seems like blow 150 million time. Please correct I’m wrong Chin Warmer I’m sorry hear this. biggest point try stress others healthcare provider it’s life versus death people. It’s quality life infection. thought might chance covering mouth would efficacy since mouth seems like primary droplet spreader, talking, coughing, yelling, lol-ing, etc. Also thought maybe direction respiratory hole might help, i.e. breathing downward nose may spread droplets 6 ft. worry keep shit know good time equivocate around proper mask wearing due ""muh freedum"" idiots. However, good see there's science around details. wear mask like that, would certainly comfortable anyone wearing glasses. I've tried around 10 different masks get fogging every single type. annoying enough finally scheduled LASIK years putting off. “Lucrative” pecker-face? stupid...they stupid.
Gonna horrible winter. eat boogers stomach acid kill virus I'd love make mask says 'masks go mouth nose' something wear properly would invite confrontation... :D Agree Fixed Very. it’s restaurant’s fault, either. extraordinarily difficult time business feel them. Support take refuse dine anywhere. Don’t care winter coming not. think that's says 'precaution'. Like, get vaccine something prevention, mean whatever vaccinated still even common area, like polio measles, still get vaccine precaution chance exposed. Might bad analogy, saying best cautious. agree people deserve service, young minimum wage worker one forced agitate people. news ""water wet"" done flight took last month. Several people politely corrected. shit protests significant vector spreading cv19 lectures, wearing glasses wear mask 2 hours sitting down, practical. get foggy time, I’m bus store, I’m wearing properly considering stay inside 10 mins max. Mouthbreathers even postpone, like can't get married party later. anybody take special precautions laundering clothes? I've read conflicting information says want use hottest water temperature, cold water bleach sufficient. want make sure ruin clothes ineffectively clean ""Just give government power feel safe!""  Nah, I’m talking physical distance, social distance means staying home limiting social contacts. definitely works, way better mask ever would. Especially office. like poking holes condom. bus driver told told got married church outside like everyone else. Right, like know GI issues Covid. thought mixed IBS. worsened post covid, changed seem result gkuten intolerance. mild form pre-covid? don’t know. know thought bread safe thing eat isn’t now. Literature also suggests sudden/adult food intolerances triggered stress (unemployment, pandemic) major illnesses (covid, needed nebulizer treatment). 

Will ever know certain? Probably not. significant change irregular potential side effect. Yet gut (haha) tells something Covid.

Edit: residual chest tightness too, still workout, less. notice lungs working bit harder. fucking shit. needed expert say this? specific strain exposed 

There one ""specific strain"" SARS-CoV2. tons distinct isolates strain different physical properties terms causing disease spreading. [zero enormous number distinct isolates different meaningful way one another.

Sorry think really learn basics trying make claims causing disease severity, certainly calling people statistical illiterates downvoting even though wrong. recess doors alcove come comment upvoted? makes ridiculous claims without source. last hotel stay, hairs stuck everywhere onto walls bathroom. could happened cleaning walls possibly fixtures dirty towels used previous occupant. Nasty. like wearing condom balls Yeah, really need give government power determine lives. Im glad moved away area yet like, 85% approval 10% disapproval. Americans think 40% Americans love Trump bad judgement nothing Indians. Yeah technically legal. places activity supposed happen forced close lockdowns... opening illegal... mean many stores tell employees attempt stop person stealing case get hurt, insurance cover it. like beyond reason think young minimum wage worker also one agitate person strong anti-mask beliefs. Thought dump. I’m feeling Corona fatigue. Hard. 

I work bank, essential business. Haven’t break year. Haven’t taken vacation year, piddled vacation day away give three day weekends needed break around stupidity (I live TN, people think hoax county makes mandate comes down- neighboring counties- open season, masks become rarity public). 

All day hear people talking nonsense. governor treated whole time, bare minimum protect state. Hybrid gone many schools. 

I best social distance- sometimes need break moment “normalcy” go favorite local hangout spot drinks darts occasional flirt. that’s outside taking caution. 

My family lives PA, taken caution, pushing visit, it’s “safe” there- it’s live, still work public. parents risk. don’t feel comfortable visiting year, matter next couple months go. feel guilty visiting them. 

Idk, I’m phase this, hoping it’ll disappear, hoping numbers trustworthy, trusting is. It’ll get better time, know will. idk, state throwing caution wind pretending longer danger whatsoever. it’s easy believe lie, within reason, go along point it’s easier. ...What people chainsaws required warning? Manscaping? Try getting piece elastic tying ear straps, around back head. Get cloth kind sell sewing shops. actually pretty comfortable. expect hospitalizations higher many people ""barely surviving""? calls selfish twat thats incivility🤔  takes 2 weeks go sick hospital Covid-19, even longer go sick dead. election 1 month away. push make seem like coronavirus liberal/deep state conspiracy designed hurt Trump. open now, see worst election. point, longer care. ""Hey, mask slipped"" normally trick. Stupid people act like ones wearing masks good, fun whatever reason safety. sucks wearing mask everyone, compromise keep people safer, less exposed virus - exposition severity one definers go hospital even die.

I can't believe stupidity era, supposed live beautiful utopia, disgracing dystopia. dare people value remaining days lives rather locked homes. reinfection cases tracked BNO data, 8 people felt worse second time 3 felt better. include cases referred posted actually probably worse practice someone thinks they're protected makes decisions based upon fact they're actually putting harms way.

In compsci / cryptography there's argument bad crypto worse crypto trust bad crypto secure communications might say something normally (passwords, credit cards numbers, etc) Free helicopter rides  Architect here.

Sometimes isnt enough room floor plan doors open outwards. Also, architects dont realize dont even need doors large restrooms, sigh. Like movie theaters.

Anyways, designers idiots. Dicknose! Um no, you’re stall get there, you’re still leave. Sometimes need little extra time toilet! people think there’s one else there, especially you’re larger stalls doors always shut position instead swinging open. “This country history providing substandard medical care white people, times painful medically unethical experiments white people, slavery times within current lifetime. example, knowledge fistula surgery comes cutting sewing white women’s genitals without anesthesia. consent. innocent, default everything photography makeup toys medical care black, white people expected make best something wasn’t designed way bodies look thrive. Therefore white people sometimes hesitate trust they’re told black medical professionals.”

...doesn’t sound racist, think good! THIS!!! Given increase positive test percentage....,very.  Fall wave here. means naïve see endless amounts virtue signaling thread alone. Rub detergent lenses rinse off, help prevent fogging. want talk understanding something? quote mean claim means. reading comprehension bad conclusion making skills.

What's wrong conclusion 
correlation doesn’t Imply causation.  would right exclusively breathed mouth seal remained same. However, almost everyone breaths nose even try breath mouth. soon stop thinking it, breath nose again. Also, mask designed scrunched like that, leaves large gaps. Lastly, masks mostly protecting others you. wear mask like sneeze etc, protecting anyone around you. hope helps explain it? antibodies seem fade months? Meaning us might back March luck. I'm still dealing constant fatigue, asthma back normal since then. read condom use normalized age AIDs. going stop people sex instead ""wear else!"" campaign switched positive one ""Condom use shows care"", ""It sexy prepared"", etc. put bowls entrances night clubs such. became accepted thing while. never admit that's absolutely case lot people. Egyptian family died. Duh. No, everyone sick it.

At time, everyone irresponsible piece shit.

Time adult. part, still go day relatively close normal. Yeah, suspicious high numbers. soon read ""online survey"" disregarded everything written. survey way scientific way prove something survey done south korea influence results (culture, health care, etc). article show sources isn’t hoax, it’s excuse government overeach Totally agree ! best ones I’ve found far made Adidas. stay face quite well. envious see someone homemade mask doesn’t slip face all! Completely different political voting system. shit, Sherlock. true. since whole pandemic policized media wont tell whole story, neither left right change narrative. welding people homes, maybe checking giving food… Maybe not… option? said got Tomosin man, damn! cant afford it! Also, comment nothing question responded to.  ""Incivility isnt allowed""

It's incivility cold hard truth, fuck moderator. must one people downvoting anyone ""boohoos"" low mental capacity sport. point comment essentially. 

The point fear monger extreme outlier cases. everyone loves. guy internet correct grammer spelling! Go get fucked! Nothing cant happen. Cope Meanwhile, Vegas...and governor takes shit, least he’s trying. Lol one cop kills someone riots protests want cops kill people 

But oh defund police right ? Cause trigger happy murderers waiting around see inevitable shit circus that's going take place Florida. seeing increase Västerbotten well. numbers still low, large increase compared earlier (from ~2 daily cases 10-15 short period time). Public shaming works Good God, entire generations wiped out? fearmongering reached absurd levels. even know lasting myocarditis etc are, viral infections reversible time. looks like kind place wear best Adidas tracksuit biggest gold neck chains. Arizona slightly similar boat. They're opening everything governor ignoring science numbers favor people head fall winter. 

As resident, way I'm going back ""normal"" numbers start spike up. I'll keep ass home someone sense something get safe effective vaccine. exaggerating bit, mean like multiple healthy family members dying it. wonder may something genetic know about? lot it’s stupidity rather narcissism never? Definitely far longer weeks. dad sure hell ever health likely die sooner virus. physically active healthy covid- hospitalized, bad. lungs completely shot. chronic fatigue syndrome. four months doctors telling many patients fully recovering pre-infection. Idk. Time tell. unarmed civil servant unit free racism then? not. point comment essentially. virus might unpredictable, statistically ""safer"" guarantee get easily. fines started immediately lived Illinois helped deter almost instantly. Kind Fauci said though. Masks + distancing others.

*Because* everyone volition, Victoria made requirement enforced it. Seems worked, too. feel like majority issues surrounding virus stem used luxury complete medical understanding illnesses effect large groups population. aren’t used medical experts telling us “yeah, scratch said last week. completely wrong”. think would say it’s fear mongering worst. best, would say legitimate, yet *very* flawed attempt understanding long term repercussions covid. 

Personally, feel learning better outlook is. sick one gets appears hugely dependent age baseline health status. treatment modalities improving continue learn effective. think people hard time conflating ever-changing data novel illness misinformation spread. everyone erring side extreme unreasonable caution. would fine weren’t detrimental impact society. Staff needs kick people out. guy mask chin walked 1 foot pregnant wife grocery store. told back off, yelled stay home, told staff. shrugged said nothing could do. say anything, call cops, shit. kept intentionally walking close us literally blocked getting close wife cart, stared sight.

I get wanting risk life minimum wage fuck, least call manager make problem make passive aggressive announcement PA system customers must wear masks something. Dipshit staff stands pointing people line guy's trying bait fight. best luck honest, seeing would assumed wearing mask nose better wearing one cause you’re still covering mouth, obviously nose optimal  There's strong selection bias seems happening here, form survey like likely attract side effects answer it.

Assuming 80% confirmed global cases recovered (which lower end what's actually reported), would mean well 26 million people recovered, according study leaves nearly 24 million long-term side effects. hard time believing *that* prevalent, we'd heard lot true. doesn’t happen overnight happen mean he's exactly position fucking put himself. ordered counties can't even levy fines. He's going kill tens thousands. think economy then? pretty obvious PLANdemic hoax designed accelerate global government control. probably microchips vaccines. I'll never understand this. ""I'll annoyance wearing mask without benefit."" like draping seat belt across locking place.

One side benefit wearing mask using public bathroom lot less fragrant now. Honestly used smiley face, whatever conclusions wish jump require form mental gymnastics I'm mood discuss.

It's genetic differences race, people. life itself. I'm different different me, regardless country we're born skin colour are. also animals venomous plants poisonous. people likely addiction, even become obese! (They found something number years ago may help people realize they're risk becoming obese, forgot what/where/when) cannot escape genetics exist, genetics humans different similar animals well. science. like saying clouds white racist. literally something read yourself, nothing wrong trying learn. 

It's also obsession, literally know minimally it, enjoy educating best free time come across documentaries, scientific journals, new breakthroughs. Perhaps watched much jurassic park little dna strand reminding far we've come since 1990s haha one least known subjects, cross lot, genetics make us human instead of, say, banana. 

""Humans share high percentage DNA bananas – also share 85 percent DNA mouse 61 percent fruit fly.""   Incorrect. original SARS gone. MERS popped years ago. get early possible. #Doubt Show credible link anything vaguely like claim? Ah, well kind remember one incident 6 months super common eh? article, learn 3 million sharks killed squalene every year, extra .25 million (less 10% extra) might killed vaccinate whole world. would call bit non-story. 

I suspect people wouldn’t care even way sharks killed; don’t attract lot sympathy. I'll give stress/anxiety =fatigue.... fucking damn it... want sense taste back! several months taste buds still sucky broken! 😭 Also, lost soooo much hair grow back. new I'm mega bummed it... No, need look word ""so"". first one comment. finally put Secret test large scale. whole state thinks it’s gone, go away? gotta love censorship Ayuso government takes ""expert"" come conclusion. Goddamn, human race getting stupider day! mean, that's frustrating people mock idea recovering economy important. strong economy helps little people. Rich people ride economic downturn buy stocks/property low prices increase wealth even more. economy struggling matter them. Ok citation says 4 7 people died, three 55 clearly overweight?

Hardly ""entire healthy family"" eh? RT-PCR nasal test see (hopefully not), IgG+IgM Antibody test see I've makes sense me.

No test shortage here, I'll paying pocket. I'd interested know estrogen levels drop also. uncle take testosterone suppressants prostate cancer lived pretty well bad. Im glad mom ok. Thankyou reddit pushing sub truth! Obviously damming evidence we're gonna die next week. 6 weeks pretty long term. basically chained bed couch months quite bad  ""open air"" nightclubs reopened August, close space ones always stayed closed. wall also killing animals migrate across southern border seasons change. 

A lot endangered mountain lions affected wall. Thanks cant believe dumbasses actually wear masks like LOL. Thankyou advice. follow right vote still guaranteed.

Just absentee ballots errors counted mean right vote service member guaranteed.

yes, absentee ballot counting could use improvements. comment leading people believe military members guaranteed right vote. Yes. Back March I've read article nurse dying, son died too. husband ended ICU, idk outcome. basically whole family.  I’m ready go sleep point. point covid going take median age America 38.2 fucking 16. don’t need extreme accuracy get point across. didn’t think would controversial state apparently is. It’s outlandish claim make *real* rough estimations still prove point. It’s job protect health. That’s job. ‘entirely’ friend lost parents, grandma, aunt, brother ended severe lung heart damage. clearly genetic component.  think R.E.M. song exact situation. I'm one believing ""the world gonna end"" ""scientific predictions"" 100 years ahead, world follow European commands coincidentally line economic trade interests. That's propaganda, friend. making argument. entire planet decided participate perpetrate hoax narcissistic orange grifter astronomical debt. I’m concerned feelings none fellow humans. piece advice requires make assumption, bad advice. assumed anyone uproot go somewhere better. This. work chain cafe (think green) require masks, state &amp; inside store itself. signs doors, windows, registers. People don’t give shit. people care now. know else tell guys. Idk safety glasses, regular glasses, essentially pull mask well nose put bridge glasses it. Ok genuine question here: wearing mask cover nose better cover mouth? say either good, one ""less bad""? Obviously everyone wear normally I'm curious Excess deaths high, gosh much higher USA.

UK: 65,000 excess deaths population 67 million

USA: 280,000 excess deaths population 330 million.  Here's one example: That's *Royal* Elite Palace you, pal. snazzy, regal. point based inaccurate data good point... getting masks ear loops elastic bands go around head? get one ties instead, adjust whatever size head is. mean dick nosing? Yeah really shows small ignorant this... ""Because can't breathe it""

YES can. tried even one minute learning breathe properly on. 
I 300+ lbs coworkers running around store masks properly on. trained mask wearing powered adjusted!

Breathe mouth. 
Breathe like shocked, breathe like blowing candle. power method while, thinking lot feel claustrophobic, lack air, hot!

It works everyone, including asthma light COPD. Heavy COPD sufferers leaving house anyway. 

Upvote visibility issues, message me. know Way Many mask tricks.  Millions people around globe deal this. wear mask safety glasses job. Almost always fog goes away. ways combat, too. takes little internet research. true excuse, 100% needs wear mask correctly, Covid real number her. lot people know properly wear fit mask end like this. think enforced all, still wear one. enforced people giant fat asses lot health problems would solved, eat like shit take care self do. Glad included second category list people move there, drugs nice getting high tax free hella groovy. temperatures don’t get cold lose home chasing dragon sports drastically different. players opposing teams really get sort close times baseball game football got guys face face launching spittle every play. It'll interesting see Vikings start getting positive tests next days. tf need experts tell us this? fucking obvious? Florida going collapse flu season. even surprise real news headline #penguinnose splitting hairs. case, it’s something people do, it’s pretty apparent children adults it. Duh never said minorities, said Black people.

There plenty studies papers subject. Here's one people bat eye people eating then? make whole mask pointless. live life assuming nobody besides clean/delicate things want/would myself. I’d grab doorknobs paper towel hand covered sleeve. news? (Oh! know - occasional moron see this!) Yes, live Florida husband lot friends/acquaintances worked service industry surge. little family got (me, hubs, 3 year old son). Also, sister law boyfriend got Maryland (mid 40’s). Everyone fully recovered serious issues. One friend seemed worst bit older rest...mid 50’s, overweight obese, smoker. took longest recover almost went hospital never got bad enough. feel quite lucky we’ve recovered. Stay safe there. Honestly best thing pandemic lot people pay attention washing hands basic hygiene coming home going out. places, even without full lockdowns etc, cases flu similar viruses transmitted way covid fallen compared last years. Even though think masks helpful almost stupidly impossible implement well working level many people misuse many products sold masks actually enough mainly cosmetic, fit well, dont filters, people wash touching store putting away people ""wearing"" nose/chin etc.  vast majority lockdowns goal. NZ really outlier achieved elimination 2 month lockdown, kudos guess. Absolutely. dining inside anytime soon. said, family makes point grab take usual tip 30%. Often times, we'll even buy things really need...like go cocktails. means, please buy go meals, especially fall/winter.  sound like you’d real fun parties. Two ways. Gradually, suddenly. example, many farmers hire work American citizens would willing do.

You left part sentence... ""few American citizens would willing **for price**."" reason immigrant labor willing low rates coercion. People went crazy Obama. Plus media loved him. better smell ya, dear. Lol yeah well would impossible given millions possible outcomes. one plan every outcome everything. they’ve certainly planned lot given ton thought. 

Why would think don’t plane? Again, they’re profitable sports league world. really think risk losing profit poor planning? don’t know what’s wrong us US many people can’t handle dealing reality. It’s pretty concerning. Everything “I want happy 24/7!” artificially, anything actually make anything better. Like guys psych drugs move on. election won’t fix pathological inability deal anything upsetting. like wiping buttcheeks saying everything skeaky clean there. you’re mouth breather?  least we're talking you, good luck tour. “I can’t breathe exactly good” made want cry. Absolutely tragic. cannot imagine losing loved one virus. think virus needs wake call nation health needs priority. Childhood obesity run rampant US yet another example devastating consequences have. areas US like too, especially septic systems. belief septic systems back flush TP pretty common I'm from. Sweden closed bars/restaurants fail respect social distancing guidelines. also limited public events 50. pretty typical social distancing guidelines. hard follow all, sadly still impossible some. Shhh, let /u/veroni_saurus move somewhere cases rising spite Nice. 200 sites go got something going on. Don’t know ... cringe (borderline mildly infuriating) call dick-nose. stay hell away them.
Edit : removed word  Wearing one 7 hrs shift get use see customers wearing mouth really slap face me. Wish people rationalized situation going on. reading like “wtf” read hypochondriac username explained everything think even need demonstrable long term effects, think period pre-existing condition now. Simply know. Considering it’s reason made original comment reason we’re conversation it’s absolutely relevant. 650k people die year heart disease noone cares. see mcdonalds commercial every 5 minutes. 200k die virus everyone loses mind.

Death part life, sad true. Destroying livlihood 100 million people save lives something hasnt even killed half heart disease EVERY YEAR.

You stay locked fear want, many others get back normal life taking precaution smart. understand wire bridge mask work, one perfect. people use pipecleaners tried kinda sucks actual worse insert masks fool proof mouth would probably worse, droplets would come mouth nose like lack consideration common decency. Like people use turn signals *once they’ve already started changing lanes* Nah, condition call *entitlement* New York's numbers point considerably worse European countries loosened similar restrictions (some months ago)? really. last interviews I've seen he's either lying incredibly ignorant he's talking (best case scenario)   hence I'm encouraging people actually donate places like :) sure get $2/day, advertising company probably gets 100s more. prefer bandanas people tell arent good. 

Based data Ive looked 80% effective folded worn properly. 

However 80% effective 100% time bandanas significantly comfortable cannot worn without covering nose. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* fact experts say this... basic common human sense enough Specifically not. 

He stated local governments free impose restrictions make sense locally. approved purchase millions new tests.. groups - entire generations young people still recovered 2008. war anyone wealthy. Period. think you’re wrong. plans might work think plan asinine. plans satisfy player’s associations order get players agree play. That's great idea. Mask maids! Yep. friend took 2 3 weeks labeled brushes sinks toilets avoid cross usage. happen twice though mistakes happen time time. happen make frogs gay?  Congrats toady. countries trying hide least obfuscate COVID deaths, regards Excess Deaths reporting, many countries generate statistics -- epidemiologists need retrospective analyses document accurate excess mortality totals worldwide. Might make sense, people probably mouth breathers anyway know one immune, I’m honestly wondering avoid addictive disinformation better I’ve able beat manage addictive things. I’ve gone withdrawals twice stayed prescription drugs caused twice. relapses. Waited would kill kept even unintentional rare metabolic issue. accepted doc Internet’s view would deadly eventually. also managed (mostly) stop self-harming stop suicidal therapy (safe me) meds. I’m prone accepting expert advice even it’s absurdly painful terrible trust it’ll better alternative. Whereas lot people can’t that, maybe combination nature/nurture. exactly sure I’m wondering social media addiction doesn’t hugely overlap substance abuse addictions. there’s overlap “can’t beat addictions” too. Like sort accidentally stumbled everything including PTSD, never illegal drugs drank lot alcohol smoked cigarettes, there’s initial choice usually choices line “stay get off” lot people can’t get off. Reddit isn’t great it’s light years ahead Facebook avoid hateful subs and, like, actually decent conversations reasonable people. Still addictive easier replace texting friends. Irrelevant. Trump promised miraculously goes away April.

Yea many people back thought matter weeks. later expanded months. talking half-year chunks. journalist digging ended worthless pile meaningless garbage. That's informative itself. Nobody knows enough useful subject. Theres something water... people days dense AF plain assholes concern others' well being. though. read article? way substantiates headline, one expert basically saying casually (as - scientifically asserting equivalence them):

""If someone’s got nose peeking out, it’s really different wearing mask""

Ubermensch33's point wearing mask covers mouth seems logically better wearing mask all. mask mouth going partially block droplets expelled infected coughing, obviously better mask all. spectrum reducing chance exposure includes variety materials types masks people using.

If people continue spread ridiculous notions like mask mouth **equivalent** mask all, simply moving away science, allows detractors legitimate opening. positive motive, wear masks correctly, needs grounded reality it.

Just look happened surgeon general said masks effective limiting spread. Another ridiculous notion positive motive (to reserve PPE healthcare workers) became line attack anti-maskers. People avoiding restaurants? Thanks😃 Probably help trying declare victory places terrible. Nobody safe stuff seems like people care doorstep I'm curious many people injured made executive decision add warning in.... get off? sounds like great idea interesting. study this? part post blame anyone him? Sorry dude, bad, right that. 

I looking PPE perspective, much protects wearer, zero case.

From public protection perspective, right, decrease viral load, since aerosols come mouth, especially shouting / singing / heavy physical work. I've gone half dozen either big, small, shaped slip speaking. work mine. fit. 

I'm glad fit well. conclude number 2 every time. Weak minded, selfish people desperately trying bring meaning pathetic lives.  think everything joke want seen way. Little know look like morons now.  Tbh I'd prefer explain front town lives in. he's martyr every insane selfish asshole thinks justified. walk shame he'd less hero. Fucking warped. Yeah fact county widely state governors don’t seem give damn virus infuriating. Florida example absolutely idiotic. sometimes masks useless. alone street prefer breathe properly. yet able stop matter mask try. Thankfully wear contacts don’t use prescription glasses time. wear sunglasses goggles wear bus work, plain can’t see. thing I’ve done helps push upper teeth lower lips breath straight down. pretty painful seconds. run small site gets 2000 users day. ran year. next year, asked donations, got nothing. threw ads it. ugly hell, get $2/day. Use coating called Fog Blocker apply per instructions. better option apply gently paper tape top mask restrict airflow.  You’re right left China near impossible stop, waste time enough slow suppress, even it’s inevitable. Contact tracing? Scale PPE production? got downvoted lol must travel lot. Hello, new local transmission 25 days. We, Vietnamese care it. reporters care? Now, enjoy beautiful life.

If trust app, install it. encouraged do, mandatory. installed protect people, usage mask. everything fine, remove save battery.

Stop complaining everything, wear mask install contact-tracing app. Saving ones love. got one last year know this, babies getting first flu shot need two doses. FYI anyone following along. soon becomes contagious, we'll get that! No. Blunt opinion. OP's wholly wrong dismiss minimize virus late date. 200,000 dead awful.

Back March, maybe predictions high, main pattern widespread disbelief models predicting anything 100,000 deaths. kind tragedy happen exceptional USA.


Now we're likely approaching half million dead end year. worst case scenario. We're lucky ebola something even rotten, deadly virus Tell Feds army Hummell experts. thinks they're going spot take Merry Wanderer one 50%, got another thing coming! think either. it'd hell ploy finally let stimulus week election, checks arrived week before. Hell even Dems try block house gop namecall fingerpoint right election.

I still doubt pass better believe it'll sway voters. “It’s easier fool people convince fooled.” Almost everyone drank Kool-aid it’s sad Oh that's blind people sociopaths. can't see faces. /s Republicans hate giving money poor people.

Clearly concessions made absolutely place get vaccine out. previous record vaccine development four years. It’s entirely reasonable think scientists find timeline perhaps bit fast.

I’m expert can’t weigh whether that’s right not, timing politically convenient either towards October towards November doesn’t necessarily mean there’s agenda.

EDIT: Here’s letter anyone interested: letter notes study participants *have yet* received second dose says two month observation period minimum second dose, opinion signatories. get one every year. Everyone should. builds community resistance outbreaks. yourself, get one help protect others. 

However, usually wait late November, like put things off. year I'm getting mine next week (early Oct.). first wave: lower numbers weekends.

It’s simple. 30,000 jobs. many people’s families affect? Especially places dependent tourism dollars. everything, nuance, comment fails acknowledge that. Typical Reddit.   course not. extent data informs policy determinations all, outliers make bad policy.

There almost 8 billion people planet. 330 million US. People die senseless, tragic horrifying deaths every day.

We can't insulate agree limits feasible. every town US, today, said ""it illegal leave homes, food water delivered you."" would save lives. would likely agree indefensible policy even knowing kill people. could say exact thing respiratory viruses infections. bad case flu elevate cardiac enzymes. respiratory viruses cause lung scarring. question much effect lung function. don’t see vast swaths population dependent supplemental oxygen inhalers seasonal cold flu past. Pretty much illnesses put risk thrombosis. Mainly severe covid cases stuck hospital bed extended periods time. That’s use lovenox hospitalized covid patients now. can’t tell many patients I’ve taken care bad UTI pneumonia present heart arrythmias labs indicate cardiac inflammation. patient infection, hypertension much desirable hypotension.

While true, it’s also true disease processes. Ya, get 97% negative rate time people relatively isolated, simply imagine fair amount mandated rather symptomatic testing.

I’m mean I’m sure younger people whether work public community / social things many months clearly plenty happening months ago too, far harder get test thus far less likely see mandated one. Neither bandanna, neither panty hose, neither type masks people buy wear. CDC MSM actually give shit mask effective. nobody says anything. matters show willing make effort. matters COMPLY.

Coronaviruses still flu viruses. Flu viruses ""disappear"" swap genes new virus snuffs old one infecting people making immune original virus got genes from, like Spanish flu. virus going that. 

And want ""endemic"" without fighting back non-lethal snuff out,while time causing enough damage still something want avoid getting costs.

Looking forward seeing remove comments calling anti maskers ""selfish idiots"".  😆😫 ... disgusting gravely immoral. No, absolutely not. believe people telling vaccines works, also believe tell vaccines months away approval, 1.5-2 years away total implementation. can't take conflicting information combine them. Either believe vaccine worked not. Furthermore, millions vaccines. There's hundreds millions US alone. can't smart-ass-pompous-and-snarky say ""there's 7 billion people world"" ignore point vaccine provided everywhere everyone huge problems everywhere everyone. Furthermore, there's evidence vaccine readily taken, US presidential candidates seem keen enforcing vaccination right away. again, everywhere everyone deal, slow spread disease significant margin. Biketoberfest 2weeks away. voting 2weeks later. something running around head ok, report suicidal? already 20 confirmed cases reinfections last month, antibodies may last 2-3 months. Don’t read articles posted Reddit? say gonna wear 24/7 post covid. said would wear mask public transportation post covid. nothing fear, stop saying that. taking every precaution available minimize getting spreading virus. difficult commit wearing mask there's high volume people. mmmm... UK already reached herd immunity, second wave? would estimate around live two every five people either wear mask incorrectly wear mask all. Even though mandatory.

This includes staff working stores, including local bakery. Like, wtf? wearing wrong then. mask correctly happen often wonder covid.

Argentina even used Sweden cautionary tale argument hard lockdown. Sure, death count still Sweden, boy, case numbers sky-high ... end goal? eradicate virus? wear mask forever? never catch covid?

 Genuinely curious? lots strong arguments restrictions regulations delaying inevitable wrong. 

Wear mask... why? slow spread? why? 

The half logical plan seems long vaccine could take YEARS - mutates might NEVER effective vaccine. 

Further delaying spread virus significantly immunity may lost creating never ending cycle. 

Funnily enough crying masks could argued ones bring selfish. want get virus, going give virus cry cry cry. actually stop think clear cut.   think sick pay relevant factor, too. possible flu? 

I’ve flu once, far sickest worse ever felt week. Symptoms obviously aren’t may enough overlap someone confuse two.

Long term covid thing. get way contracting covid 19. Symptoms vary. COMPLETE FUCKING BULLSHIT. safety nets meant save businesses, they're meant save people, business, public health system once.

You backwards clue ignorant sound - countries able close businesses keep closed safety nets. know, people buy food maintain physical emotional health lockdown ALSO knowing job better chance side.

When mandated companies pay share keep healthy society can't fire people willy nilly worker protections place, guess happens? Businesses save rainy day. Funds set weather something like pandemic depleted stock buybacks CEO bonuses. 

This means countries engage meaningful lockdown holistic bent focuses wide variety safety measures maintaining social contract government people without recreating fucking Hunger Games.

It's called symbiotic relationship. comment naive REEKS privilege, even though know think does. reason businesses (but all) MUST open U.S. people faced losing homes. able feed kids. make broad statements act like risk survival factor everyone, countries strive safety nets, reduces risk everyone time ensuring health society mentally economically. one saying fuck people children sick relatives can't afford medicine.

I'm actually confused first comment even jives youre saying latest comment. sound like someone idea take nuanced view things intersect systemic issues inform issues like poverty ability lockdown completely without giving shit people will.suffer - mostly minority populations U.S. already attack every way also make larger percentage ""essential workers"". guy acknowledge washing hands continue walk out. day company said could trusted keep healthy thoughts-and-prayers safeguards going away.

The theory I'd protecting others - maybe expelling fewer droplets. Maybe expel 2000 mouth 1000 nose. covering mouth reduces risk 2/3rds.

Viral load antibody titers later stages disease also predictive disease severity general population.

The causes disease severity SARS-CoV2 well understood. know risk factors include old age, heart disease, diabetes. know things like antibody-dependent enhancement, occurs, subset patients, etc. likely explanation lies cellphone movement data, showed participate protests traveled less, effect started three days protests began lasted weeks. part, attributed curfews protest suppression measures local state authorities.

## claim protests ""didn't spread infection"" general

It claims used anonymous cell phone location data conclude non-protesters stayed home protests started, order avoid violence protests, resulting net increase overall social distancing. certainly sounds plausible.

However, *actually claiming* spread disease begin pooling sample 208 primary counties, include largest 315 U.S. cities municipal population least 100,0000 across 30 days estimate difference-in-differences model

They comparing relative change infection rates counties (and also including immediately counties) see correlation protests. Already means protests caused **nationwide** surge infection, analysis would find ""no difference"" research design capitalizes variation differential outbreak protests time across “treated” cities conjunction “never-treated” large city controls experience protests sample period.

For example issue here, Austin San Antonio two counties less hour drive. study design assumes would zero travel attend protests (or begin pooling sample 208 primary counties, include largest 315 U.S. cities municipal population least 100,0000 across 30 days estimate difference-in-differences model following form: (I'd show formula Reddit can't Sigma Panel I, specifically assess treatment effects across protests turned violent compared not. generally find increases percent residents staying home full-time time spent home sets protests, though effects expectedly stronger protests accompanied media reports violence.

Violence good thing according study. peaceful protests were, disease would Panel II, specifically assess treatment effects across protests ongoing compared last one two days. cases protests ongoing, find within 4-7 days onset first protest, percent residents staying home day increases 0.73 percentage points, falls 0.53 percentage points seven days; estimates statistically significant. contrast, effects counties protests persistent smaller (0.37 percentage points within 4-7 days 0.38 percentage point 7 days) statistically indistinguishable zero.

Wait, *seriously?* largest persistent protests convinced **a fraction percent** people stay home? misunderstanding. Let's look graphs social distancing measures, Appendix Figure 6 (page 45)

Ok point protests made visible difference? looks like social distancing following **same** weekly pattern before, still reaching bottoming Friday, going little Saturday, peaking Sunday/Monday. *But largest protests tended occur Saturday*. study mention effect ""more people staying home"" tended **lag** protests. implies usual number people would downtown anyway **during** worst protests, staying home *afterwards* matter much.

There methodological issues identified analysts well

http://www.finbit.org/questions/48031/did-the-black-lives-matter-protests-fail-to-cause-a-spike-in-coronavirus-cases/eAENykESwiAMBdATpejowvE2MY2SgRLkh47Hl_V7OaLjmRKK9jDBhmAp-pPM7aOb-JG-UxHmDen-uNyuabedIiu96ppU7VTQwRE6qA-PlUFvtkrhJDyhxIRuRckaiQ9vfNqYWAjFHy8cMDg

But worst fallout protests probably even direct infections...

## effect public perception

This glaring limitation scope paper: consider effect protests public's perception risks. would even able measure effect, national news coverage simultaneous would likely affect public behavior cities roughly equal degree. study looked **differences** rate change infection *between cities* (rather time), would see nationwide change.

Here longitudinal polling data collected *weekly*. notice every single dimension concern related pandemic fell sharply lowest point ever **5/29-6/1** wave, first poll taken protests began. invigorating amount Well news practically **forgot** pandemic protests started, certain leaders even many health experts betrayed Hippocratic Oath *encourage* spread one thing authorities update policies based new *medical* information. blatantly *political* reasons absolutely ruinous public trust, suggesting health guidelines restrictions **not** based objective medical science health experts endorsed protests even admitted feeling cognitive also well-studied psychological concept social permission. (""everybody else going crowds big deal protests ""didn't spread infection"", despite greatest violation social distancing yet, directly implied ""social distancing **can't** CDC mix words official keep **6 feet** others. cloth face cover **not substitute** social distancing.

Also fact became **young** people accounting new infections implied differential effect based demographics. Young people likely join protests, also *support* them. *wanted* believe safe required believe social distancing mostly young look often hear talking masks matters. **This** reason **must** dispel notion protesting safe: notion incompatible believing social distancing important. ""blame"", public health going forward. article title says equivalent wearing mask...that falsehood! Heck know, I'm expert.

That said, we're already delaying release phase 2 phase 3 trial all. Every step delay presumably reason.  Still false dichotomy. selfish dickholes?

Hmmmm bit difficult hand dryer.  One favorite films. Well said sir :) stupid, feel-good idea end reducing effectiveness contact tracing.

What contact someone want self-isolate resents ratting out? gives two incentives deny contact potentially put hook ""false"" report. Maybe omit mentioning contacts might tempted this. understood ban giving “false information” would also catch someone omitted mention close contact friend relative, hope helping escape need go 14-day quarantine.

So need mention them, case someone else told contact tracers different story get caught lie. could infectious week ago--am sure remember contacts?

At point becomes unsafe cooperate contact tracers all. even becomes unsafe notify contacts yourself, since creates evidence contact occurred remembered it.

""Fine!"" might say, ""We'll force everyone cooperate contact tracers pay even bigger fine. [make fine lying ten times people get tested. They'll conceal symptoms anyone calls it, they'll say notice thought cold. Everyone take note. signature move masses. even hold door prevent person behind touching (hopefully) clean hands. Duh waiting.for Herd mentality. Libs don’t listen 

/s ads? maybe 8 confirmed cases won’t enough destroy league. They’ll fine flattened curve! /s really. shows far viral particles spread (her model mile) ability particles cause infection. first need viral load get sick, also need mostly intact virus - particle one. 

It's interesting article, science sound, model could really helpful figuring spread patterns inform public policy. However, article struck trying draw clicks early stage study, anything practical point.

One easy point refute study outdoor transmission major factor - states strong guidances lockdowns saw pretty rapid drop transmission rates. states strong laws wearing masks outdoors, unless area crowded. Even bigger possibility thought, first concern really stopping idiotic states, like Florida, opening bars, maybe encourage people keep take instead eating in. mention.. keep kids home, also allow parents stay them? 

The take away though - might want wear masks often think should, especially cold days without much wind. think depend location local mitigation measures. example, friends northern Wisconsin right report ICU beds Green Bay around Green Bay full emergency departments putting people hallways rooms available. 

You may see increases Florida governor cut back restrictions bars restaurants well limiting mask mandates. on. fucking shit. past years really lowed number slick days per year. worse death chronic side effects thousands..?  shit sherlock Coronaviruses Covid share next nothing common behave, mutate, work, kill.

Ok. I'm going go scientists one. Kind like go geneticists wanted understand genes expressed animals. also equivalent ""This person dumb enough wear like that, even want waste time arguing them. Avoidance procedure activate.""

Is public beatings far? Asking friend. literally makes sense. Unless breathing general air spreads it, moisture contact like what's well promoted, nose uncovered huge thing (unless sneeze). Talking, breathing coughing covered redirected away things facing.

If nose exposed allows spread, mask literally anything air emitting magically bamf somewhere else, gets pushed past cheeks past eyes chin. nose, typically, points last checked talk noses.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: good idea, leaves wearer vulnerable obvious sneeze MAJOR issue, say equal nothing means mask simply nothing first place, unless sneezing directly onto someone way spreading. read long haulers getting back normal yeah, halloween going super creepy real year. done multiple times, accident though..I messed hate say it. following script.

I mean, that's reasoning...

Remember mask prevents particles going well particles going in. major function mask actually prevent particles going **out**, theoretically stops source (an asymptomatic carrier's mouth nose). cloth coverings surgical masks ok, even though filter small particles. still capture large water droplets disrupt airflow enough make difference. wear mask protect **other** people, protect yourself.

Masks also prevent particles coming in, mouth nose. particle still land eye . land body near body get transferred face touching.

So protection incoming particles less protection outgoing particles, still helpful everyone wears mask, two masks every mouth.

The article says covering nose like wearing mask all. make clear they're talking protection incoming vs. outgoing particles. Obviously, get 0 protection incoming particles. take genius see ""equivalent wearing mask all."" terms outgoing particles, assume come mouth, offer decent protection, right?

I'm justifying behavior, I'm answering question, ""why people this?"" rationally possible. want breathe easily still cover mouth, highest priority. (But missing middle priority targets). form passive aggressiveness. ~~Vaccine~~ Chaos Looming person front you? Shields filter air, redirect - people behind exposed even front safer. We're phase 'Idiocracy' Monster Trucks scene. Hard know, I’m trouble finding original study reports articles like this. saying patients article could refer seen hospital treated way every person gets test medical facility considered patient even they’re admitted makes muddier. sure Korean practice medically using terminology able assess directly maybe article author wasn’t accurately capturing word patient intended, knows well, duh! im fucking expert No, expected 55%. saying ""it surely must reduce droplets degree"" 

And wrong. correct. 

But technically correct, reduction miniscule point irrelevant. difference functionally nil. 

Stupid people dont need know difference all, asterisk requires public health advice explained ammunition stupids argue back. 

They need clear, concise, consistent messaging. ""This works"" ""this work"" stick that. health advise giving longer single statement, anything resembling inconsistency explanation, use weapon attack message source manner propaganda.

I ALSO think assumption *necessarily* severe second wave knee-jerk truism point, based incomplete understanding 1918, repeated pundits quoting pundits extent becomes seen fact. instance, world war troop transports absolutely crammed full contagious soldiers, different species virus mutate much faster drastically. (Not mention virtually knowledge viruses work.)

So non expert opinion, there's real possibility things could get rough - possibility WELL within capabilities significantly mitigate - there's also reason believe we're 1918-style fucked default ""that's pandemics work"" whatnot.

I'm convinced, trying find highly conserved antigen (and antibody matches it) actually unique particular coronavirus comparable finding needle haystack, even modern technology. antibody tests came way fast trust testing antibodies *unique* infection. No, situation described involve coercion threat violence. Presumably describing voluntary interaction two individuals one requests wear mask prior engaging close contact. perhaps describing situation property owner requests person property wear mask. violence threat violence occurred.

We could even go far describe entirely different situation property owner requires anyone entering property wear mask. Still, violence threat thereof occurred. Everything entirely voluntary mutually consensual.

I specifically discussing masks, rather broad illegal unconstitutional ongoing civil rights infringements government taken. put context question, government demanding person wear mask public private property involves threat violence including killing person submitting obeying demands government violating rights. situation government demand wear mask public private property voluntary involve consent. Consent matters.

Also, personal attacks make argument case. I'm morbidly curious though criteria defining ""people like you"" (in reference me). Could clarify exactly mean that? 275 people though none got sick enough hospitalized that's pretty good news also said they're testing family members exposed see prevent virus. Clearly wearing mask nose mouth better wearing mask mouth better mask all. don’t know people feel need exaggerate lie right stance. know long-term complications, we? wear mask 100% nose thingy I'm running (yes, run mask) need catch air bring little bit bring get back it.

Other time I'm bringing bags groceries inside mask falling I'm going stairs cause guess sweat. equivalent people feeling need take mask order speak someone. got Covid eating drinking party room 20 coworkers hour. 7 others also got it, 3 relatives people got it, too. (So 11 people got one sick person coming event.) 

No fucking way eating restaurant least May. need experts tell us this? call ""Dick Nose""   give people nearly enough financial support maintain quality life assistance finding job places still operating themselves. 

But don’t worry, long complain politicians behind it, totally makes things better (to clear, despise trump frankly congress people doesn’t make problem go away... wait January). desire want world operate fundamentally different way, make world operate way. one asking sympathy investors owners lost investment, livelihood, possibly case small business everything have. 

However reality live in, real world, businesses go bankrupt knock effects employees losing wages services might beneficial community longer available.

Your opinion stupid expressed. defend right express opinion, still stupid opinion. study prove all! statement 100% false.  Real question: hell fog glasses? almost got hit car see cause glasses always fogged mask. matter tight loose make mask.  Fogged 24/7 That's titanic development! yep pretty much every restaurant bar packed people, especially weekends (usually upper-middle class white neighborhoods since fancy restaurants obviously). know fact even nightclubs one wears masks. people absolutely love going nothing stop them. turns wearing mask actually wearing mask?

Crazy. think test numbers Sept, abundance tests available, way equivalent test numbers April, dying rich get one?

Because do, I'd urge donate brain scientific research die. already power. feeling safe. actually safe.  


If worst country world responding this, would give shit opinions. we've proven self-centered, science denying idiots. So, yes, please protect responsible vulnerable ones them. 


Or could open bars, open schools, stick people back cruise ships watch people die.  


It's funny shit pants 9/11 50 9/11s worth deaths less year virus 3rd leading cause death country, can't bothered what's proven work places. Strange bedfellows say least. positivity rate hit 3%. N F S

In news, jumping ocean makes wet—*even SOCKS on!*

The sheer stupidity murderous negligence people staggering. like ask can't stand breath? can't neither anyone else please wear mask correctly. lol Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said Tuesday ""no way"" country's second nationwide coronavirus lockdown would lifted three weeks originally planned.

Originally scheduled end October 10. is. believe anyone says weeks. They'll keep extending unless say refuse lockdown period time all.

Why even say ""three weeks"" first place? going cause people stop obeying. UGH!  thought aspect. woman good compliance. I'm sure whether men would better worse. Oh mean like protestors people sub won’t wonder people think shit joke still libs don’t balls call morons. parties filled trash people. forgot tub. Gahhhhhh, I've seen it. Can't get head. stated goal vaccine effective 50% trial subjects. Even get vaccine, still 50% likely get it. restaurant owner worker, happy rather nervous. Translation infected covid-19 go less severe course disease patients first wave. turned basis inventory Dutch Internists Association (NIV) among supporters.

NFL isn't. right - let's see significant anti-vax becomes pertains pandemic. Though admittedly change American leadership could make big difference... provides people ammo need shun.

We people smoking community pool. hung signs people could point around pool fence line became really hard pass ""I know"" (bullshit) really killed argument smokers. Yeah usually small one. Yes I'm aware thing. good comment besides absolutely terrify OP? almost like spectrum people there. different immune systems genetics effects come.  publicly acknowledge lack proper face covering(or complete lack, cases), compliment someone next (proper) mask wearing, walk away argue/retort. context, live America, people think public safety isn’t worth mild inconvenience themselves.  Biden wins puts place strict measures contain deal virus resulting eradication, people claim evidence whole thing hoax. Mark words. retorted obesity one biggest risk factors coronavirus refusal correctly wear mask endangering life, mention showing compete disregard others may also risk. Yeah, check yearly cancer deaths compared Covid. thinks it’s dress code Les Schwab employees. even 300 friends. That's big wedding. Agreed, screw trump republicans Im wearing one right work definitely comfortable wear bit uncover nose, otherwise usually squishing nose, squishing nose, chin pulls mask talk cuz mask loose. Also breathing warm breath back eyes took little bit get used to. wear every day work biggy, definitely covering less less uncomfortable. don’t understand. assumed mouthbreathers. there’s bin every stall/pooping hole? signs say mask required. don’t want wearing mask anyhow, signs don’t say “mask required worn correctly.” realize sort bombshell revelation... Source? whole problem, part it. outbreak started maybe one two players got practice field infected much larger portion team. fking shit.

I complex. Kind think I'm little bit better fellow man. know im smartest guy long shot however. pandemic made feel like god damn outcast.

Its unbearable stupid common person is. 2019, WHO/CDC Scientific guidance dealing pandemic specifically recommended locking even severe pandemics. push, urged people WFH possible suspend classes.

But saw China - became Settled Science overnight. one? Hmmm talks suddenly back tracked advice night agree! spreading via mouth though entire Midwest different Iowa alone. rates much higher states, including ones around us comment wrong start. 

TestIowa tests processed State Hygienic Laboratory University Iowa located Coralville, Iowa. no, “laughing stock” comments made still trying defend original statement it’s wrong reference Iowa. know, state talking here.  

No mental gymnastics needed reading actual numbers living covid reality every day work. hand working hard make self-proclaimed “half information entire Midwest” fit original comment made. Hospitals test everyone surgery procedure, higher rate symptom free people people go testiowa, course lower number positivity rate add 50 percent tests. 

Again, original comment wrong, actually proved yourself. great work there. old job going different buildings every week. touched enough greasy doorknobs nowadays use either foot sleeve open doors.  look like total morons. mean masks kinda cool gotta wear normal way, ninjas, wild west bandits, motosports, doctors etc. wear masks kind look kinda cool, never see one half ass nose thing, feels like complete opposite looking cool grating. Germany, call ""Pimmelnase"". sources consider without bias? 

Here’s fourth article. Well, yeah. Obviously? need experts tell lol Yeah go sliding glasses grampa-style now. used use tissues, waste tissue paper. deficit effective COVID-19 therapy, along etiology, resulted 500,000 confirmed deaths time writing

The bot says published Jan 2020, article site says March 2020, article claims written covid deaths 500K. think I'll wait break champagne. [This describes role male pattern baldness. really know applies women.  Georgia better Florida though? kept GA's numbers. Zeppo, you????? Agreed. That's point. 90% reduced effectiveness equal mask = 100% reduced effectiveness. may close same.

If pull ""experts say"" card appeal scientific authority way, need get small stuff like right. post article biased news site prove shit. 

They straight told people gather large groups happened Floyd suddenly large groups fine. found solution can't share it, gotta little internet research lol? flying heaven rate Uhm, pretty confused. *I* talking excess deaths. agree official figures worthless. believe ""dicknose"" preferred nomenclature. feel like SNL joke skit. need expert tell metric yet available measure efficacy masks mandates date?

It would appear regardless mask adoption rates, infection rates unaffected rise fall? would technically following mask mandate. bullshit children do. Ask pick toys, pick one toy. Ask get dressed, put underwear. Ask wear mask, cover mouth. 

I've never seen child wear mask covers mouth, unlike boomers. masks worn generally prevent spread droplets mouth commonly expelled speaking eating laughing etc. general, normal breathing cited expelling droplets great distance mouth breather approach still effective. sneeze obviously rude people always case.

Also people sick wearing masks dont know anyone sick even know anybody knows anyone sick. I'm saying right wrong trying answer question w common sense rather condescension shaming tactics become status quo. People dont want live way. notice title post ""US passes UK official total covid-19 deaths *per million*""? I’m so, sorry. heart goes you. Yeah, ill make big scene publicly call wearing one, also I'll kick store.

&amp;#x200B;

Ill follow car wont stop, people like worst. don’t say protests didn’t cause single case. said weren’t significant vector spreading virus. 

Here’s third article I’ve linked.  ridiculous. happened over, Texas, Arizona, New York elsewhere. Much easier breath, doesn’t fog glasses go places masks required. (Not justifying means answering question) know everything globalized? Virus, goods, stupidity ignorance? Typically I'm alone desk working.
Because sometimes boss come check I'm doing, mask everytime. Even I'm alone. outdoor drinking least NYC fun first isnt nearly socially majority people get drink walk around city personal group. getting laid home could afford it, really missing 2020? make look stupid. *Everyone knew that* ""Respirator"" name properly-filtering mask, even regular disposable medical N95s exhaust valve.

You also easily attach filtering material exhaust valve reusable respirators them, making protect others well regular mask. Wokest virus ever! Gee wonder many end dead jerks. Yeah, know sucks covid hit ruined wedding, really important risk people dying? No. important. shit admittedly currently working toward breaking habit. typically sinus issues, often, alone, would pull mask nose breathe clear putting back.

I've working towards getting used fully times. weird, uncomfortable, duty wear masks properly fight hellish year. It’s like pulling seatbelt instead buckling it... hold hand whole ride Hair salons open months nyc. Outdoor dining great far nyc limited capacity indoor dining set open week. People meeting friends without issue (unless ofc friend want hang out). People allowed get married. large indoor gatherings like still banned. ""technical"", pretty blatant stuff legal. live US stuff listed illegal? heat dryer cycle actually effective wash. So, really matter long run clothes dryer. Rebekah Jones responded USA today article referring to. mouth breathers. Oh makes sense, thank responding I’m worried idiots can’t bothered wear mask properly mouth breathing mongoloids don’t support anyone, reading comprehension levels. calling ignoramuses? Sounds like Dengue fever. that's bad. reddit without socialist kids trying proselytize think something like 96% people low Vitamin D. includes people working outside, living outside, world, demographics, etc. everyone take supplement vitamin D. 
I swear thats true. remember exact number. live town freedumb fighters, purposely trigger “libtards”. want move sooooooo bad. melted labia legs. absolutely justified lawsuit. judge awarded much money punish McDonalds knew issue continued normal anyway. result uptick deaths, whether indirectly directly. 

Lies. Nonsense. kid relevance viral load. may interesting study respects, hardly ""landmark"".   Strawman, people obviously care take attitude people around you, happen lot. work liquor store, know least 
 2 dozen people who've know someone did. 2 customers relative die, owners lost relative back home India last week.

But even I'm say fuck it. even *still* one person every day say ""this election""

Idk year shown best worst people article recommends fucking behind public building, don’t say anything Church Yeah didnt read full thing posting one. Yes, free stuff answer. Welfare. Good already told mom I'm definitely visiting over. miss birthday, birthday, Christmas, new year, knows else. understands. betcha. corona family relatives currently creating invite list coming party (cold, flu covid). Basically want inconvenienced way. basically meets requirement wearing mask nobody confronts get let stores, breathe like wearing mask. lazy people believe pandemic real finding path least inconvenience. countless experts stating wearing anything professionally filtered respirator type mask protection incoming virus entering nose mouth useless mask blocks large particles, small virus.

but

Wearing mask mouth least reduce amount airborne droplets exhale cough sneeze offering people around protection diseased breath.

They many competing articles many different experts contributors hard know believe anymore. sit around wonder many people read competing crap say screw it. could never care bankruptcy business. would weird. think bad things companies laugh headline.

I believe business. Get decent way conducting life operating business. fogs glasses, poor fitting mask. allowing air escape around mask. also inhaling air around mask, instead it. fill gap tissue, lowering efficacy mask. mask better nothing, please consider seal choosing one.  Imagine dumb Wrong what, lockdown-lover.

We've got handle way overwhelm healthcare systems, eradicate it. Well, *equivalent* wearing mask, guess covering mouth *not factor* simple nose covering *equivalent* wearing full face covering. Unlucky outdoor spread seems much, much lower indoor spread - even without masks. Outdoor without masks seems safer indoor masks stats show. study shows far particles get survive trip (UV light forces) concentrated enough. actually get 'experts' weigh this. Unbelievable. safe way haircut? I've resisting year hair gone short driving crazy, getting used long, driving crazy again.

There barbershop right next house. Literally next door. 

What consensus this? fine safely, would better wait deal it?  way south could spared immunity north impact. 

North gets hit hard. Lockdown happens. Spread continues cases drop naturally. north got hit first, south locks spread happens there. Lockdowns ease spread continues. lockdowns begin south still less hard hit. 

This benefit hindsight action south has. twin towers filled elderly people “pre-existing conditions” certain elements society wouldn’t problem it... whatabout...ism?  think dumbass fucking weirdo. vaccine alone would end pandemic. Everybody takes it, large number people take, they're immune, over. 

Life returning normal fast, next spring fractions people's daily lives changed. April type subreddit. everybody acts like do. source supports I've said, past malpractice black people principal cause . pretended copy paste statement nowhere found article try support erroneous point.
I notice glossed that. Maybe shouldnt assholes. need experts explain this? Wow need expert tell us something obvious!!! extinction thank f Karens!!!  Ok cares 28,000 employees lost job contribute already high unemployment rate could possibly lose homes lives poverty. long one life saved corona, al worth it. face coverings nose equivalent ‘not wearing mask’: average IQ people

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* LMAO didn't. Experts across board say way wearing wrong. even need MAKE argument LITERALLY experts saying. Yet decided know better. yeah ok. Yes people wear masks feel important feel like making difference. because, know, science shows inhibits spread virus killed 1,000,000 people caused longterm complications millions more. big circle jerk.

Lmao. Course it’s not. feel seeing article NYT places significant progress us argued strict covid related mandates date. ""wrong side"" conversation taxing mentally. Especially as, points last six months, simply talking efficacy lockdowns measures prompted death threats piles downvotes believe tolerance dissent. Also, add imo inconceivable buisness owner behave way. live age covid. Masks thing. Handwashing thing. Social distancing thing. amazed anyone would operate buisness, much less restraunt like this.

I hope wearing NBC suit virtue signalling hypocrite.

I wear mask correctly learn read instead getting knickers twist lost argument internet. Great.

Now explain literally every fucking retailer America. unclear comments, patient doctor/other hospital employee?  data released hour ago There's less less stake virus continues become endemic. is, we're rational ""shut everything vaccine because."" European countries already allow public 500 more. Sweden falling line them. already events five digit number people countries What’re referring to? Tons people got sick big outdoors parties protests. entire July spike that. time people want props quitting smoking. cAn't BReAtHE Edit: copy pasted comment couldn’t see. 

I’m sure intentionally obtuse. Yes, agree medical malpractice one main causes **attitudinal barriers** greater participation. Attitudes however one many factors, directly taken study quoted: Several factors affect participation African Americans studies identified including elements study design, logistical problems, low levels health literacy, sociocultural factors, specific attitudes hinder research participation. Mistrust academic research institutions investigators **the significant attitudinal barrier** research participation reported African Americans.

So like said, medical malpractice part mistrust, part attitudinal barriers explains part lower participation rate. 100% supports argument. Yes effect. No, it’s one. it’s anywhere near important one, it’s one important ones within attitudinal factors. 

I’m really sure explain clearer. source states extremely plainly. 3 year old damn good keeping mask on. He's autism spectrum (high functioning), sure sometimes attitude 90% time stays covers right holes. Like 99% people, I'm New York, I'm really nervous all.

If like bit outbreak, postpone season two weeks continue left off. [This warning back automotive error code reader.  *know* got put due idiots complaining. thank scumbag Fauci that, flip - flopping masks. obviously work, heck, people used Spanish Flu, even question?   I'm sure fully agree two. think way learned treat resulted lower death rate. Part also contributed masking, even though there's lot people half assed / all. human studies done influenza lower initial viral exposure impacts severity illness. 

Basically masks helping us like old-school inoculation methods. read study stated since mask mandates put effect across country, asymptomatic cases gone 15% 40%. taken us months policies put place desired results - Florida ruining everyone. 

We still failing miserably smart policy behalf many states kept increasing cases turning huge death surges. gym ""buddy"" (we talking right now) who's nurse who, despite years schooling medicine, get's caught propaganda ""Only 6% deaths COVID!"" ""Masks work!"" ""It's flu!""

I can't talk anymore. IDK medicine know cause death listed. IDK ignore many reports young adults serious illness take basic precautions. IDK could read articles nursing brothers sisters NYC say yourself, ""Won't happen me. happen here."" reality distortion field Orange One depressingly strong.  That's true NY times good seeing states sorted highest 7 day case death average. small circle it, 6 coworkers it, one coworker lost brother brother law week, friend spent 20 days ICU 12 days ventilator, another friends lost aunt, friend husband died it, one customers retired cop lost 3 first responder friends another 2 critical, another customers worked first navy ship hit it. fairly small circle around myself. inhaler month half another coworkers pneumonia 6 weeks. Trust me, hits different people different ways. I’ll admit it. fully believe need everything contain problem...but COVID really brought selfish asshole me. go restrictions law requires. Except masks. That’ll stay even gets lax Damn, heard Fauci's voice. results indicate COVID-19 hazardous elderly also
for middle-aged adults, infection fatality rate two orders magnitude greater
than annualized risk fatal automobile accident far dangerous seasonal
influenza. overall IFR COVID-19 viewed fixed parameter
but intrinsically linked age-specific pattern infections. Consequently, public health
measures mitigate infections older adults could substantially decrease total deaths. wish easy mask- unfortunately, essential worn anyone going outside, they’re substitute strict social distancing. need vote democrat annoying Opening kill anybody. People immersing crowds unprotected kills. American, I'm bit skeptical flu (only flu, I'm antivax) vaccines. Dunno US, usually multiple strains flu season, vaccine usually made common one. drawback, gives slight immunity drop next 2-3 days shot, increasing risk getting one less common strains. might considered risk small European city, city 10mil population actually kinda bad, get contact many different carriers every day. personal experience - got flu shot 3 4 times last 8 years, got sick every time Except number still rising.

And without lockdowns quarantines would lot worse

And it’s dying that’s problem. still literally idea long-term health effects like NY Times tracker. Free registration. individual states (like California) written laws balance budget. Individual states also financial powers US federal government does. Trace DNA. Make em pay. Threatening people fun games soon people see wrongdoings consequences small hat. Oh absolutely underreporting US, doubt that. Every country underreporting every country degree.

That's makes hard compare numbers.

Additionally, like fractalfrog said, definition also different every country.

Also within country level reporting variates lot. village lot social pressure cover keep silent big city, police readily available less social pressure stigma. true country different degree, depending country urbanisation grade.

Racism ostracised might still core root cause minorities across world, absolutely nothing one unethical medical experiment. 

Or, evidence would case? see, example, black participation medical trials lower specific area somewhere far away? would consider evidence least effect. Right you’re crossing arms saying “Well think makes sense”. logic noone rural area would ever get flu.

Yes tests antigen, antibody. European explains much.

Thank gave new perspective happening  middle-class enemy, upper-class answer no, affect them. Much like Dems spent much effort defeating Bernie wanted M4A Yeah, novel is, slower get ball rolling. dangerous step process, lot drugs die.

Phase 1: toxic?
Phase 2: create response expect, dose?
Phase 3: effective?


Each phase gets bigger bigger, generally monitors safety throughout.

The cool thing vaccines vs say treatment chronic illness, phase 2 could go super fast. see antibodies blood? much, booster shot help? could probably enough data 6 weeks, there's bunch paperwork... trials sometimes take longer start immediately locations, might 100 per week start 10 weeks. obviously cut time.

With phase 3 vaccine, depends prevalent disease is, contagious is. pandemic, like covid, pretty good shot people trial exposed, also infected control group. diseases like chicken pox, predict exposure likely within 3 years... wait.

Other types treatment require multiple continued doses stretch periods long enough make sure kill liver, kidneys.. burn hole septum. going something treatment thread demonstrate, shown time. He’s morbidly obese. real point, little silly. live U.S. picked Vietnam co-workers there.

US always trying 'save' world, appears outsiders like (by mean majority governments/politicians around US) willing let large chunk population die underlying health issues possibly rest life leave economy fucked years come. 
If anything pandemic proved countries culture reinforces individualism 'fuck mine' mentality best. Well floridas case dont income tax. tax income besides business tourism. 

Unlike federal government, states run deficet spending.

I agree opening 100% option have. 

They try increasing taxes GOP controlled state. ""It is"" He's sending drug coupons senior citizens lieu helping actual medical coverage, creating 'Platinum Plan' black communities nothing materially help black communities, arguably could hurt worse. think honestly best team come with, I'm sure promises get wilder gets desperate. Soon unveil plan install, one, two! diet soda machines test that? Perhaps bleach stain? deflecting.

Nopes. asking think somebody thinks ""there X"" would know exact number %? 

It strange thing believe, I'd like know think so.

To perfectly normal know lot giraffes New York, without knowking exact number made assertion, either 1) show proof 2) admit actually know

Nopes dude. I'm train google stuff phone.

The assumption based lifetime experience. live Denmark people physically active. Loads people work out. walk lot bicycle riding big mode transportation here. way less overweight people thatn USA, get exercise. less medical problems.

It's Americans eat super unhealthy food never use bodies think medical problems making fat. bad consider mental health medical issue?

Yes course. met loads people mental health issues, rule super skinny. diet mainly cigarettes coffee here. point emotional reaction, besides feeling suicidal, morbid curiosity people's emotional reactions behaviors point. get feeling people given endpoint clear goal, win war lock certain amount time virus eliminated return normal, general sacrifice incredible amount achieve it. someone told another lockdown spring would lick thing good could go celebrate, I'd say go it. plan continue remote working/learning, mask wearing, banning gatherings like restaurants, sports, bars vaccines arrived, I'd fine. 

I'm sure that's realistic. get feeling ""herd immunity"" red herring. Places like NYC large amounts spread might see huge waves, one wave, doubt virus go away. looking likely endpoint virus, sans vaccine medical cure, circulates like one coronaviruses causes common cold. I've thought since May theory ""Russian flu"" 1890 actually one coronaviruses plausible likely preview SARS-COV-2 endgame. Even vaccine, listening TWIV podcast, find likely coming ""first generation"" vaccines prevent infection spread. Vaccines provide sterilizing immunity sound like much longer off, possible. 

What then? long people tolerate ""social distancing"" form? comments articles suggesting social distancing vaccines distributed suggest vaccination psychological endpoint many, even amongst sub hostile ""anti-mask"" sentiment. 

Personally, I'm concerned physical health. Honestly, relatively young good health, I'm concerned physical health without vaccine based statistics. I'm concerned parents thought. I'm concerned mental health, well mental health society seems to, understandably view, view widespread vaccination psychological endpoint heightened state anxiety overall arousal. People stay war footing long. Still, worry parents, hope fears vaccines prove efficacious elderly amongst young unfounded. Florida, state stupid something stupid. surprises mean it’s 0% still locked down? Intolerable! I’m glad Obama killed Trump chance become BFFs him. evidence protection get coronaviruses, flu different beast think get going bad time. I’ve always gotten flu shot wouldn’t going pharmacy/doctor’s office increase possibility getting flu/Covid? think used anonymity good old snail mail polarization come disagreements. People made views extreme counter others. Best course action ignore extreme views completely, engage. generate discourse middle sides adding views, we'll gradually encourage moderate responses. “Are classified human”

“Negative, meat popsicle” ""has problems breathing mask"" get cloth masks sold grocery stores material freakin' thin almost like wearing mask. fabric thin gets sucked mouth talk. communist nation feels like it, totalitarian nation. Non state sanctioned get togethers allowed. Im glad we're praising this. Arrest fine people! also encourage children neighbors snitch parents throw everyone non government sanctioned get together jail. also need control media internet anyone spreading falsehoods Covid punished fullest extent law. come fight armed soggy cardboard tube.

Don't moderate general purpose subreddit huge chunk posts come quarantined sub. Oh wow clever original. Nobody ever mentioned before. catch onto dastardly plan convincing people vote Trump discussing glaring holes poorly done research papers!!

Major eye roll. fucking joke... Thanks validating previous comment think posting survival rate 99% people age 11 somehow proves fake 

Well, we're factual here, 99% population whole. Terrible argument tantrum thrown. Please stay isolated society. ...People actually shit? 

damn... ""I'm going pile making something person never said rest mob think good boy"" Masks mandated city long time now. people fine it. Even little kids.  

When see anyone inside store (staff, customers, care) mask improperly deployed, say something every time. I'm rude it, I'm particularly polite either... skip ""excuse sir/ma'am"" tell mask needs cover mouth nose. Every time, except two incidents, person immediately pulled mask up. 

It's policy make known people community, government worldwide conspiracy, want mask up. owners/managers private businesses enforcing ""no mask, service, exceptions"" hear well. 

I want fucking virus. care might die it, want it, wearing mask really little ask. Now, compare New Zealand Australia...

Not looking good, huh? Chinderwear :( Totalitarianism is concept a form government or political system that prohibits opposition parties, restricts individual opposition state claims, exercises extremely high degree control public private life. 

China totalitarian government... make erode trust government entirely vs R party ? Right back you.  ""If America shut virus fairly quickly, may become widespread testing contact-tracing strategy impossible, leaving next president unrecoverable disaster deal with. Nobody knows sure many cases it'll take bring about, UK going second lockdown flirted herd immunity several months warning."" /r/nottheonion shit Sherlocks. Everyone differens hardly proof 90% get long term effect covid though wrong. 

I read see parroting other. NZ Atlantic Canada done well creating bubbles banning travel. 

I think one cases told ""[masks find later do.

By way, CBC article correction bottom, guess missed it:

""Clarifications

We initially reported travel ban Wuhan, China, delayed spread disease three days. fact, researchers also said helped stop spread international cases, combined social distancing measures.

Since cases practice social distancing, thus travel bans help. shit. can’t vouch many people occasions. truth can’t see! glasses fog especially I’m breathing fast. try there’s nobody around find pulling mask often like admit Likewise. know many people I've heard taking piss, flushing urinal, door.

Taking good healthy shit work open eyes. also shake hands anyone work, either. honest it’s really creepy hang around every post sweden seemingly lust collective demise.

Bit turnaround many Swedes lusting every nation's ""collective demise"" numbers look bad... K, appreciate response. thanks! vaccines... [be] flying shelves like hot cakes!

**This!** 
I've calling dicknose. shocked moderator 500+ posts T_D back fray downplaying severity right election. enough Republican governors Senators make noise constituents hurting Trump could forced respond. rate transmission outdoors much lower indoors. Ideally people outdoor protests six feet apart wearing masks too. (At least that’s one march went to.) harder you’re inside sitting around table. Young people transmitters covid risk folks hidden concern. Yeah thats true far know none sars/covid viruses vaccine

It's possible primarily consequence economic considerations. 8000 cases SARS, SARS practically disappeared. can't sell vaccine that, research stopped. Agreed. football uniquely brutal sport catastrophic injuries sadly regular occurrence. lack preseason amount star players gone already placed lot scrutiny injury frequency season.


Football nightmare human body, can’t play around schedule guys. way, really?
I exercise riding bike glasses getting fogged actually dangerous swear read somewhere would willing base playoff seeding win percentage instead record case teams miss game. bit unfair better nothing. little actual enforcement social distancing. number 1.

But nothing article ensure relative risk kept context. I’ve literally taken literal Stats 101 literally stats work grad school. brief article literally gives information methodology would useful drawing conclusions you’ve reached. that’s blood levels work. people “normal” range traditional start Poland, jump queue. Thank nice words. Maybe it’s late better mask. family quarantined since today, son’s teacher tested positive. 
And wasn’t wearing mask either. fucking face shield.
Fuck selfish, science denying assholes. 
Stay safe guys. intentionally they’re certainly getting nonetheless here. Yes, that's terrible. appears study founded ethical principles, least understand today, perhaps better intentioned beginning later on: subjects studied six eight months treated contemporary methods, including (""606,"") ointments, mildly effective, highly toxic treatments provided quell suspicions part participants.

I'm sure Wikipedia means ""only quell suspicions"" methods available.

Also, funding treatment lost, study continued without informing men would never treated. None infected men treated despite fact 1947, antibiotic become standard treatment syphilis.

So penicillin standard treatment fifteen years study. Also, say men *were* treated medicine time?

This regarding Clark, head USPHS, credited founding it. initial goal follow untreated syphilis group African-American men six months one year, follow treatment [Rosenwald withdrew financial support, treatment program deemed Clark, however, decided continue study, interested determining whether syphilis different effect African-Americans Caucasians. regressive study untreated syphilis white males conducted Oslo, Norway could provide basis prevailing belief time white people likely develop neurosyphilis, black people likely sustain cardiovascular damage. Clark resigned study extended beyond original article seems misleading regarding treatments, said previously administered patients six eight months, line Clark wanted. saying lost funding treatments. event, original founder resigned, leaving study air (he still sounds unethical best, though).

After 1947, Penicillin established clinicians could chosen treat syphilitic subjects close study, split [control testing penicillin. Instead, continued study without treating participants; withheld treatment information subjects. seems like Wikipedia suggesting SOP medical research community leave untreated, even fifteen years study commenced. 

All suggests context times: lack treatments lack laws governing ethical standards, seems *some* details blurred bit. study certainly unethical, likely racist motivations played significant role varying degrees throughout study's history, well classist (these men poor share-croppers). Definitely, longer study ""progressed,"" unethical racially fraught became. deserve robbed, everyone else was...

Mmm. personally breathe ears think idea potentially ""better nothing"" even 30% effective compared wearing correctly.

Sounds like even 30 overestimate though. Yes, invested idea even go insane lengths claiming maybe countries also medical experiments minorities. Absolutely inane. 

Let’s sum shall? evidence you’re dumb country earth smaller proportional participation every single minority countries. exact thing see US. Nothing brought forward show participation rate lower countries, leading clear conclusion specific medical malpractice non-significant impact participation rate minorities US. 

Feel free actually address arguments. Which, know, you’ve tried hard avoid far. think many people 2 common mask styles (disposable surgical shaped fabric ones) FIT FACE. Particularly fabric ones, contain enough material, surgical one nose wire, way hang on, either.

You conviniently ignored fact argument didnt stop there. need look excess deaths since everyone count report way. understand absurd compare selfreported coronadeaths Portugal example reports 1 4 deaths Sweden reports deaths excess deaths?

I didnt say country paid sickleave im saying Sweden increased paid sick leave, including many left wing things. US Brazil that?

The Swedish response save economy.
They choose thought human suffering caused lockdown would greater shutting controlling ways.

The Public Health Agency dont care economy. responsible it, know basic things want debate thing. Secondly, Sweden used expensive measures, extra paid sick leave, would much cheaper lock people up. Oh god, fucking serious?! Good. people deserving vaccine him. Sadly endless parade posters obsessed screaming Swedish apocalypse stay rug. main goal always flatten curve

Which another way saying ""let infections continue slower rate"". 30s good too. 40s probably okay. physically body kinda getting old sucks. Mentally still fun. 

My grandmother 90 still lives alone huge house. claims happy enjoys life, super grumpy time. Literally hates everything. know lol Where's conspiracy? large shark species eat fish squid

Very much true, least that's eat.

Larger sharks like great whites eat sea mammals fully grown, including seals, whales, sea lions, sea turtles, sea otters, dolphins, anything else happen run across that's easy convenient get, like carcasses above.

Tiger sharks eat: Common prey include crabs, shellfish, lobsters, squid, bony fish, small sharks, skates, rays, porpoises, turtles, marine birds mammals. Duh! people genuinely stupid. Like, lost cause type scenario. shouldn’t need “experts” tell us common fucking sense! Hey yo 

There actual ordinances implemented

Why would people follow soft recommendation leadership telling there's nothing worry about, overblown hoax Democratic Party? That's worst possible example. case question well documented. coffee routinely served extremely hot, lady experienced life-changing potentially life-ending injuries. accident fault, agrees, coffee would significantly hotter typically served days. Worse, one hundreds seriously injured people.

Mcdonald's put warning cups that. started reduce serving temperature well. stop overfilling black coffees maybe make cup explode mere suggestion.  Absolutely useless fear mongering. Delete fearmongering garbage high quality information. crazies mean ""people listen nearly every scientist medical professional around world"" yes crazy. sheep mean ""people realize scientific reality political statement issue"" yes. Bahhh. agree many factors connected individual may stable infection reinfection. many factors not, viral load exposure likely vary. Rest head well, Awesome Shopper you, cure fibromyalgia. think many purpose. However, recently seen server this. pulled back up, falls back talks. take wearing it’s pulled far chin talking causes pulled down. guess though. see. thick fabric masks def suffocate try run. That's something considered now. Experts needed say this? like realise breathe nose xD True, error variance (which is) treated random, affected regression towards mean. statistics 101, remove error variance (by finding something explains it) random. They're self-centered entitled think *inconvenienced* basic decency. death rate covid extremely low. die health conditions. 6% get covid health issues died. I’m trans woman, I’d call people this, I’d get harassment, demeaning name calling, people literally coughing face, one guy turned hip show gun.

Like, trans women supposed never raise voices, even speak, reason, guess. always. cycle supermarket shopping, glasses often cold. moment walk in, matter mask, vision fogs completely. pull nose 5-10 minutes glasses warmed up.

Unfortunately there's simple way around this. I've tried everything, simply work. No, read carefully. careless UK US. Swedes unbanned really late. month ago.

I focus excess deaths. Giesecke Tegnell promised countries would caught now. happen. would change goal posts towards something can't proven. Sweden cheated keep ICU numbers down.

It would leftist save wealth middle class working class. Sweden none that. usual. Swedes stay poor. pretty assumptive say excess deaths left account reported covid deaths caused lockdown Bro, manager local supermarket anti-mask. thinks covering nose doesn’t change anything. Eyy cunt, read? got done saying wear mask go public, I’m gonna sit say it’s comfortable mask like guy saying. hard glasses without steaming problem buy anti fog spray put glasses mask high glasses pushed forward [Just one prefer. spend minutes Google research results turn up. medical term shitforbrains.  plus side, glasses don’t fog up.

I saw two people glasses morning. 

It also keeps humidity inside mask. wear one minutes exerting (at work example) gets hot, case anyway, makes feel kinda awful. know everyone super mad honestly describing experience masks, but, well, asked question provided simple answer. Maybe different experience. know would speak success story. plenty dumbass anti-mask fellas, protests already. We, terrible methods retirement homes/long term care homes, allowed hundreds thousands people die horrible conditions outbreak began.

We managed get hill June, soon school started, cases started skyrocket. makes sense, idea get much data people sick enough care. hope widespread/routine testing we'll learn more. Saw pretty good meme day. 

Properly worn mask: “believes science” 

No mask: “doesn’t believe science” 

Nose exposed mask:, “believes science doesn’t understand it. ” 

Mask chin: “Believes Magic.” 

Seems like best explanation I’ve see date. Public shaming worked far me. store allowed tell people cover noses pull mask down. make sure say loudly people around look. mostly boomers guy early twenties satisfying say ""Hey buddy pull mask *thank you.*"" Covid literally destroying obese individuals, insane, honestly kind wake call unhealthy americans are. Motivates even exercise healthy, control factors control people like breath fresh air. nose like AIR FILTER car. car air filter clogged car runs harder damaged components. like body block air passage way getting fresh air. body needs work harder achieve right amount oxygen. can't may damage organs body..FYI makes sense tbh. think everyone else wrong sure right, care think.

What baffles people try get away washing hands, worry people think they're gross don't. think gross?? chile, get penalty fee using masks mean, obviously right? Neither US technically (aside refugee temporary foreign worker programs) geographical location relative huge populations poverty line makes situation challenges incomparable theirs.

I hate humans goddamn much...  Even CDC says so. systematic review, identified 10 RCTs reported estimates effectiveness face masks reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections community literature published 1946–July 27, 2018. pooled analysis, found significant reduction influenza transmission use face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; I2 = 30%, p = 0.25) (Figure 2). One study evaluated use masks among pilgrims Australia Hajj pilgrimage reported major difference risk laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection control mask group (33). Two studies university settings assessed effectiveness face masks primary protection monitoring incidence laboratory-confirmed influenza among student hall residents 5 months (9,10). overall reduction ILI laboratory-confirmed influenza cases face mask group significant either studies (9,10). Study designs 7 household studies slightly different: 1 study provided face masks P2 respirators household contacts (34), another study evaluated face mask use source control infected persons (35), remaining studies provided masks infected persons well close contacts (11–13,15,17). None household studies reported significant reduction secondary laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections face mask group (11–13,15,17,34,35). studies underpowered limited sample size, studies also reported suboptimal adherence face mask group.

Disposable medical masks (also known surgical masks) loose-fitting devices designed worn medical personnel protect accidental contamination patient wounds, protect wearer splashes sprays bodily fluids (36). limited evidence effectiveness preventing influenza virus transmission either worn infected person source control worn uninfected persons reduce exposure. systematic review found significant effect face masks transmission laboratory-confirmed influenza.

We consider use respirators community. Respirators tight-fitting masks protect wearer fine particles (37) provide better protection influenza virus exposures properly worn higher filtration efficiency. However, respirators, N95 P2 masks, work best fit-tested, masks limited supply next pandemic. specialist devices reserved use healthcare settings special subpopulations immunocompromised persons community, first responders, performing critical community functions, supplies permit.

In lower-income settings, likely reusable cloth masks used rather disposable medical masks cost availability (38). still uncertainties practice face mask use, wear mask long used for. theory, transmission reduced infected members contacts wear masks, compliance uninfected close contacts could problem (12,34). Proper use face masks essential improper use might increase risk transmission (39). Thus, education proper use disposal used face masks, including hand hygiene, also needed. feel like I'm taking crazy pills but:

Am one whom, given choice Lockdown someone love (or myself) dying, I'm choosing lockdown every single time?

Like, I'm dead, over. fun. memories. anything. least able socialize digitally, send gifts care packages holidays locked down, future date (even vague moving) I'll get hold infinitely better someone love dying *guarantees* I'll never able hold them, see them, hear voices again.

Also, folks acting like Lockdowns kind standard that's worldwide. places world locked whatsoever. places locked down, almost ""locked down"" there's restrictions like masks, curfews, gathering business limits I've read there's literally one example (Wuhan, briefly) folks actually literally Locked homes authoritarian way. also notice customers pharmacy get counter, large percentage actually pull mask speak pharmacist. seems concept mask wearing *difficult* many people understand. Todd Akin entered chat.... spreading misinformation. course outliers; mean norm. See Well thank science grocery store, hopefully rest catch too. There's difference yet understood things happen randomly. early days. nearly every fast food worker gas station employee America wrong, go figure. Sigh. Two things. First, protection greatly diminished nose exposed. Second, people breath sneeze nose. Really simple stuff. end August tourists running rampant. locals talked stated busiest season ages UP. surprised all!  gotten point passive-aggressive towards people determine they've worn one deliberately: *lifts phone ear* ""Yeah, yeah, totally! great see many people wearing masks. Lots **idiots** still refusing wear one though! I'm surprised they're also wearing red hats! haha""

We'll see long stop passive-aggressive straight start carrying unopened bags masks. Malicious compliance. countries worse Sweden right wing ""more"" lockdown.

Im saying anyone cheating im saying everyone counts differently. probably countries counting deaths Sweden too. example Belgium, explaining 3rd deaths per capita. international standard would weird everyone counted similarly. strange you? 

US paid check measure stop spread save peoples economy. reason normal safety net like leftwing countries.

If Swedish know government stopped constitution interfere Public Health Agency work. called Ministerstyre want look up. didnt prioritize economy, like admitted Swedish CDC ones calling shots. dont care economy. however take holistic approach public health, focus covid. things society causing suffering, agree?

I idea allowed assume maybe cause owner day. One thing seen discussed much geopolitical implications this. Chinese vaccines safely stored much higher temperatures (Coronavac's temperature range 36 - 46F cool room temp fridge temp).

This may force developing countries adopt Chinese vaccine supply chains Western vaccine simply worth cost-benefit analysis. Even US rural area, single dose Chinese vaccine shipped standard padded envelope cold gel pack using standard USPS 2 day shipping ($10) whereas US made vaccine would involve custom courier shipping dry ice filled box ($500).

The media done good enough job asking western biotech companies put inactivated virus vaccine portfolio bets. matter national security West pursue inactivated virus vaccines parallel mRNA vaccines. pointed tax money changes hands, including people hard labor (rather getting nothing).

Money changing hands. order think inherentance taxed, uave think someone gets money nothing deserves tha npeople work it. Id laugh carry day. wear mask dont get wrong, I'd pay mind quick chuckle you. See cbt lawsuit title be: Coronavirus face coverings nose equivalent 'wearing underwear private parts out' got etsy. Maybe try there. face contouring folds, nose wire, adjustable ties, filter pocket, machine washability, really whole package.

Trump publicly contradicted decree within days. make anywhere near 15 days. 45 year old coworker started talking 50 new 30. Maybe 40, 50? Lol want see mental gymnastics ima ten years hide fact I’m turning 40 soon. Coronavirus overblown scam. played.  time nose slips don’t realize comply basic mandatory mask rule, still anti masker. ""i can't breath"". assume anyone arrogant self entitled idiot IQ 50. probably selection bias. someone gets minor symptoms second time probably think reinfected get tested.

Also study Qatar suggesting reinfection rare even environment people repeatedly exposed (at least months): situation, hydrodynamics important? Overall, assessment makes sense me: paper creates clumps get stuck hang-ups, turdpedos slide through. studies place. Seems majority people, based subjective data, experience long term side effects. NYC areas antibody rates close 50%. Almost 20% Manhattan. reported widespread health issues months height pandemic Apr/May. Saxony Florida Germany, cases (yet) policies. Considering actually one yet, surprise? I'm wondering clothespin nose would compare mask ... Probably favorably, really. people keep taking face masks ""discomfort"", clothespin would even poorer real-world use. can't stand smell breath. That's reason truly fathom. Imagine inhale hot trash hours end. insufferable to, right? That's gotta it.  breath usually good go. day wife made spicy sausage cheese dinner. wear mask couple hours later. Holy shit. miserable.  

So that's I've decided. like wearing mask, I'm wagering breath smells like hot trash.  Unpopular opinion:

It think right-wing rebellious act, quite similar drooping one's pants, stand apart. disagree, think it’s looks ~800% stupider. know People think gloves protect everyone everything forget actually change they're mouth breather anyways fine /s I’m trying rationalize it, must cannot breathe nose covered.

Also turds pretty smooth unreal isnt common sense. see younger people maybe right. Factors control treated random. doesn’t matter biological not. control longer random. However, data obviously factors don’t control making 3 cases milder 8 severe. fact random factor show regression towards mean. also fact data affected random factor. null hypothesis see regression towards mean, hypothesis rejected. far seen anything reject null hypothesis.

~ Arcade Fire mandating mask dumbest thing opening things up. Yes right. Unfortunately people may everything right could still catch Covid. Well level headed people realize virus real going anywhere elections. kinda see flip side though, media drilling Covid raw seven straight months it’s insane think part election year (I said part it, calm down). Maybe people hoping mania least simmers election. I'm really confused sure phrase this, amount paper they're using exceed poo volume?  glasses top head actually need using ridiculous logic. Oh lambskin condoms still protect pregnancy much lower percentage latex condoms still ok use lambskin condoms.

that's literally right now. wonder much government involved point. think *should* involved, flu vaccines USA get distributed every year [somehow figured private flu vaccine seems readily available everywhere year. Last year shopped four different pharmacies could find it. design mask far comfortable I've tried. band across mouth, separate pieces extend fit nose chin. pressure nose, fits snug chin hold place. Knowing full well covered numerous replies, post anyway get chest. 

First off: People buy masks nose wires. mask like directs breath upwards, basically spraying germs possibly viruses up, showering spit. That's gross! 

Secondly: masks (non-clinical) market sizing. adult big face gets one normal sized face, course fit! Talking drags down. think they'd make effort buy new one actually fits. Laziness. 

Thirdly: Yes, people think noses attached respiratory system. know sinuses are. tell test (up nose) gonna tickle brain, freak out. love that. 

Forth: cannot tell many Americans (I'm resident Florida) shape become breathless getting car walking clinic, would stunned. caused various degrees by: Morbid obesity, COPD, chronic lung disease, asthma. often think myself, get like that, I'd *know* time lose weight, go doctor, treated it. Alas, huffing like pass acceptable here. 

Fifth: work COV19 testing center. remind folks wear mask way treat COV19 positive cases inside (for lung x-rays) exposing possible COVID infection. freak fix masks immediately. BUT: terminally childish patients sit waiting, often pull masks think I'm watching. people deniers - think joke. 

Lastly! call CNA arrived clinical testing hours complaining kid fever, headache, cough 3 days, expected seen anyway. explained purpose testing hours (it's dark examine outside, lab already picked today's samples, bring possible COV19 patients unless need EKG x-ray, COVID, could possibly catch coming inside) threw hissy fit. ""So can't treat non-COVID patient?! care gets test not, he's headache fever three days!"" told ER wait till morning. said put lives danger unless to, said, ""I know that, I'm CNA! can't see him?!"" I'm afraid point got bit nasty tone voice told risk son infecting patients. asks name, gave it. point I'm going give false name. Maybe Sheila...or Karen! recommend controlling spread?  gradual, note various dashboards disclaimer validity US data, methods measurement. So, apparently, data s$@@hole countries deemed reliable US.

Hopefully, reliable portions US, certainly others.

I've saying since February suspect getting downloaded lot. know two elderly people stick nose masks. reasons, can't breathe otherwise. One morbidly obese overweight smoker. proud Canadian liberals!

So, I'm sure one would expect workers comp virus. wash hands pee average Wally World interest enforcing mask laws might offend almighty customer. customer service obsessed anything less highest satisfaction score customer survey gets trouble. society pandered adult toddlers shareholders demand year year sales growth common human decency gone window. enforcing social norms treat employees. race bottom. 1: people werent uunable receive care, go hospitals. happen bad flu season well. Houston hospital system whole never full.

2: hospice thing Detergent take care anything clothes. I’m pretty conservative virus wash clothes cold hang dry I’m fine. sense ruining everything wear, that’s overkill fair, many young people haven’t getting tested starting August so, began required colleges.

So catching many, ***many*** cases — good thing, terms contagion. likely makes age cohort look suddenly heedless, fact numbers higher along didn’t get captured.

ETA: “Between Aug. 2 Sept. 5, weekly cases COVID-19 among people aged 18 22 rose 55.1%. Northeast region recorded 144% increase COVID-19 cases”

Colleges unis NE testing like ***mad*** it’s actually uncomfortable wear like that. Putting mask nose keeps fabric mouth talk. really. tried jogging mask on? fat walk fast upstairs? move lot job overweight maybe gets short breath mask make easier. tell fat people quarantine please consider 1/3 americans overweight people jobs cannot stay home. don’t care would rather comfortable Arrest them? in, put 300 guests handcuffs drag (poorly ventilated, crowded) Tombs infect everyone else holding? people holding spread around local community (or prison, wind there)? mean CDC released study stating cases surveyed, positive cases twice likely attended indoor dining establishment, bar 14 days preceding development symptoms. hard believe, makes total sense. bring quarter million people across country pack bars restaurants indoor environments, transmission going occur. know aerosol transmission possible, especially packed indoor environments poor ventilation. taking substantial risk putting settings.

The protests outdoors. I'm saying transmission occurred, enough cause traceable widespread outbreaks. Here's problem ""just increase taxes."" state income tax state property tax. Fully 81% state's revenue comes sales taxes. 6% comes licensing, another 6% business income taxes, remainder smattering sources. collapse sales tax revenue simply can't offset. could try raising sales taxes, since tourists coming in, would taxing constitutents (and sales taxes regressive, there's that). 

We're fucked. question fucked. Sales tax revenues Florida dropped 16% 05-08. Sales taxes Florida 15.4% June, 3.3% July, 5.4% August. FY ended June 2020, total sales tax collections 3.4%, $1.347 BILLION dollars. entirely conceivable could see collapse like GFC, except time driven entertainment/hospitality industry rather real estate industry.

Yes, DeSantis put position- although looking NYC/SFO bankruptcy stats, unclear collapse could avoided better containment measures. clear state tax structure put DeSantis state Florida large, rock hard place. matter do, serious pain likely lies ahead. We're talking influenza public might wear masks avoid infection protect others. 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza (swine flu), encouraging public wash hands reduced incidence infection significantly whereas wearing facemasks not.[ 5 good evidence facemasks protect public infection respiratory viruses, including COVID‐19.[ absence proof effect proof absence effect. pandemics caused swine flu coronaviruses caused SARS MERS, many people Asia elsewhere walked around wearing surgical homemade cotton masks protect themselves.

That little line definitely made far worse tbh. Anyone watches fox news conspiracy theorist seems think cant breathe mask on, limits amount oxygen receive. expose nose might get enough oxygen.

There plenty examples, chose ridiculous knowledge Canada Trudeau also really nice. really hate see people this. also hate see grocery store restaurant workers this. friends never want go restaurant order grubhub. reason give them. many innocent black people killed CHAZ summer? many cops shoot year? elderly couple (easily '80s) grocery store wore masks get in, made big deal taking put again. 

like understanding vulnerable virus rest us trying careful. see people going great lengths try protect people like them, piss it. r/maliciouscompliance add on, article goes far say this


“There’s pathogen know that’s essentially hidden. don’t know who’s got virus … doesn’t it.”

Complete nonsense, hurts cause go-to “maybe cover meth mouth mask. Get coke nose too.”  agree. expect drive clinics. Large employers set sites get pharmacy students inject people. works flu vaccine. took five minutes year get flu vaccine work. inactivated vaccines showed signs adverse effects SARS-1 vaccine development. much lack empathy weighing risks detriment society. Nearly 1.25 million killed auto accidents another 20-50 million injured disabled. suggest ban cars save lives say make horrible person empathy? opinion no, makes someone says cars integral part lives, many ways saves lives, allows us travel faster, transport goods, that's sad worthwhile tradeoff. could said shutting businesses. There's third, less insidious reason: uncomfortable worn hours hours. me, get hot feel awful. Whenever go building wear properly, best work. However, there's nobody around (at work) drop nose time time cool down. Maybe experience unique, I'd guess not. People wanting sabotage legitimacy contact tracing system part long-term goal destroy it. Yea.. live close border dutch gf diffrence crossing borders huge, much better still, atleast try something lol. implementing tougher measures starting yesterday today far know. know 8 people fine 2-3 weeks. one friend knows someone ended ICU still recovering, I've heard seen anything indicate anything close 90% people ongoing symptoms.  so? nation leading school system? assure surefire fix, nothing me. one first things military trained reality good weakest link. mean one idiot something wrong boot camp leads everyone push ups, also, means one man goes down, everyone runs pick get everyone else safety. need *Department Fucking Obvious.* 😂

Imagine headlines short ads: DOFO says, wear mask mouth nose.

DOFO says: pick dog's shit walk.

DOFO says: polite clerks customers shopping.

From I've heard past PSAs (that thought dumb, time), maybe least **some** people would realize, Hey really need listen DOFO alerts, I'm learning lot helps get along people better! told telling us vaccines chaos, creates chaos. I'm sure findings - people smart enough wear mask properly also often mouth-breathers, so... Honestly, seems people 10k followers twitter. “There’s pathogen know that’s essentially hidden. don’t know who’s got virus … doesn’t it.”

Is joke? pathogens essentially hidden, obvious ones exception. Clearly article can’t trusted Dude one super disingenuous framing 0-19 year old fatality rate overall fatality rate. anything, one who's acting ""all knowing"". superior enlightened amongst masses ""sheep"". must agree, protection others, spit particles come mouth, face covering mostly stops reaching people. Also zero facts article support claim restroom doors open inside? WTF!

It's combination opening doors blindly hallways design, regional building firecode ensure people get trapped smaller rooms external pressure differences, active choice hinges inside smaller rooms one can't locked inside them, odor control opening door inward draws clean air bathroom rather forcing smelly air out. censoring messages now? Let us figure shit ourselves, no? $40 usd? That’s good. It’s free anyone Australia. straight cannot figure out. It’s significantly uncomfortable wear mask way (at least me) much people Spain actually keep distance though? remember cell phone data showing Spaniards Italians lose restricting movement around community. news family drunk driving victim would like alcohol banned family kid died car accident wants automobiles banned Yup. move is: wash hands, dry hands paper towel, use paper towel turn sink tap fling open door, 3-pointer wet paper towel trash can, slide fuck problem masks. literally 100+ years old woman survived spanish flu coronavirus, suspect illnesses well throughout life. full shit. something wrong you? clearly even read comment properly. even need experts tell us ,isn't common sense ? Trump cause dollar worth toilet paper? Let’s include Cali we’re it. Probably average entire state versus individual county. L respiratory viruses also cause lung scarring. flu, coronaviruses, RSV, go list.

The important part much scarring cause, noticeable effect lung function quality life. scarring minimal don’t notice.

I'm willing little less social vaccine arrives. 
When go (Seattle) outdoor place couple friends drinks tables socially distanced still worry afterwards. Maybe I'm paranoid 😳 Yep. States balanced budget requirements still run deficits, borrow money cover budget shortfalls make tomorrow's problem. keep borrowing money pay interest money already borrowed. NJ good example state balanced budget constitution that's massively debt. Good you! already it, opinion valid. essentially will. United Nations, sport events, ect. less overtime. depends protests/riots. They're leveraging legislation bill saying 'we help pass bill UNLESS let us put forth want'. Usually stuff completely unrelated Covid relief something controversial they've wanted pass awhile able to. dirty politics Wow. “COVID big deal” bots full effect thread. aren’t fooling anyone. 

Yeah. entire world taken major hit economies hurt Trump. /s 

Give break. 

Apple hasn’t announced new iPhone like pretty much every September (which likely cost hundreds millions dollars) spite Donald Trump. /s 

Uh huh. I’m sick hearing “it’ll November 4th”. say isn’t? done assholes. Florida border.. keep trump US

Since entire presidency summed one word:

golf

Florida three things:

Idiots, Meth, Stanley Cup

Oh Covid That's something conveniently rarely gets brought talking-heads Fox News they're talking ""scary socialist Democrats coming steal hard-earned money!"" vast majority people getting upset rhetoric would never even remotely affected it. already it. mild big deal. Mostly summer holiday lifted travel restrictions Probably $750. Yay we're alone!

... oh fuck, we're alone... band together wall Florida already? BINGO Quite honestly actually thought would point test frequently return degree normal activity. Test inexpensive quick turnaround time. even imaginations home test kits requires test morning enter results app go work, school travel. acceptable. everyone upvoting person, look post history. anti-white racist hates men. talk chore asked do, bad boy. Family gatherings dangerous entire support system wiped one go. Imagine mom dad, grandma grandpa even aunt carol get sick... take care kids couple weeks? car crashes high percentage causing lung brain car crashes habit putting people hospitals months? 

Most definitely Elevated troponin levels automatically mean long term damage. respiratory viruses exact thing.

To check permanent damage you’d need ejection fractions before, during, well infection. enough time passed say causes permanent damage. He's fucking evil noticeably dropped off. Bu bet we’re still highest country. everyone Ignore life changing effects lungs? sound awful believe care anybody rate infectiousness decrease soon symptoms go away? know goes away almost completely around 10 days, say symptoms totally gone around 6-7 days. infectiousness lower time patient symptoms?  really interesting vaccine forced, think panel vet COIVD19 anything. anyone think vaccine made mandatory perhaps ""forced""? live debate COVID want join Actually Stalin would put restrictions society is
The positive rate Florida false positive rate test. don’t know means, might house long time. letting pandemic rage control excellent way make poverty worse. *Black people NJ pays highest property tax country, average closer 2.5%.  Hopefully states take notes open soon too. Can't wait go downtown soon Russia sees Germany serious threat. Russia knows Germany motivated appropriately. call area 10+ hours major city? Writing ""balanced budget"" constitution another underhanded technique cut government services cutting taxes.

Cut taxes can't afford feed poor kids cut services oh hey afford cut taxes! cut taxes can't afford schools cut services... on. sub needs drop politics rule. extremely clear one side sending us death spiral, need able yell loud clear. young people can’t handle mild restrictions months year, weak. That’s another type natural selection. Na It’s OT, think it’s also banks currently trying force employees back office. Quite banks funds significant exposure nyc real estate market, Force employees back office try slow bleeding. You’re telling lol. devastated. great seats group buddies clamoring one come Tampa long remember. Flu still kills. deaths acceptable though, right?, Congress cut deal forgive 2020 taxes exchange Bezos pay employees (direct hires temps) sit home live tests warehouse delivery AI. F doubt. 

My aunt mild case. rough cough little touble breathing. april. 6 months later hardly handle stairs house. great health going gym every day. gets winded walking bathroom.

2 aunts died. 3 cases family outcomes good. Purdue random weekly tests. risk getting infected pool get randomly picked often though frats whatnot.  right. 
If say 2+2 5000 get call idiot. 
Openings things 0 safety protocols, opened early reckless, counter everything science knows mitigate impact virus. 
Stop stupid things (that put lives thousands risk) I'll stop calling stupid. 
Their stupidity real life impact rest us. covid deniers, anti-maskers, open nows prevented us getting control. Screw idiots feelings, stupidity literally killing people want us nice them... somehow also kill 700,000 people died outside US? Financial Times really good tool 3 day average tracking graphs What's worst Trump said kept 250K-ish deaths (I forgot exact number put out), ""would done good job"".

We're going hit th number like next month lol. even finished first wave yet.

FUCK poorly scripted movie. Yeah well doctor tell beginning outbreak use Vaseline nose thwart virus. may effective spray. ""conserva-conspiracy"" read?   Wrestlemania near SuperBowl big Florida lost too. president concerned health well-being Americans. theory heard immunity developed virus widespread large number people acquired virus recovered. guess effect may similar vaccin taken population people build immunity virus question. 
So safe president's task force go CDC recommendations thing happen people? elected put position power play games livelihood people supposed protect? one failing properties trying promote business?
Enough enough! Vote terrorist office. Stalin reincarnation. wave one... get... three times larger?  DoNt TrUsT CdC aNyMoRe!.?.$*""^×( Two questions:

1. suspected health impact abnormality?
2. possible abnormality existed COVID made like suffer serious infection COVID? (possibly explaining high prevalence group) think got here?

Barry saddled fucked timeline again. Again. count testing done. tested positive 6/20/2020 still gotten smell back. sure, kids adults alike simply following restrictions. Call fatigue call stupidity, doesn’t matter, recognize reality actually happening.  Facts mentioned. 100k city employees made greater 100k per year (not including health &amp; pension) 2019. 

De Blasio’s wife staff 14, cost roughly 2MM/year. 

The city spent 3B OT costs 2019.

I quite sure NYC tax revenues significantly hit year. Guess what, every city state country. world dealing similar issues. 

You can’t institute massive lockdowns basically stop economic action expect experience tax revenue shortfalls. They’ve made bed past decade [spending) combined decisions year. need NY plates around Tampa since state lockdown. 20 million dollars 2 years investigation absolute best agencies can't pacify Alex Jones level conspiracy lovers left RUSSIA. yeah, definitely conspiracy theory.......... Ok. Thanks explanation. I’m going I’ve read. Daily reports aren’t reliable due test processing times. Often end dumping results multiple days one day live hotspot, it’s definitely part everyday life. Plus legalized alcohol “take out”! margaritas go cup now. read drivel... *really* think people stayed home died rather go hospital? god. didn’t even beat back once. shame forefathers, it’s becoming increasingly obvious many understanding safety standards serve people nation. 

To think never improved safety standards, horrific preventable deaths would norm. Like fight got on? 1920s standards. Let’s even hold pilots strict standards cause like fuck it, that’s choice get sketchy plane. 

Vote wallet!! Ok well airline industry doesn’t exist humanity probably set back hundreds decades domestic international business can’t happen effectively. Packages take 10x long. businesses stupid Amazon purchases. 

It goes on. best part it, economic gdp per capita growth gone. mention dead bodies. Human population drastically reduced. 

But alarming amount people don’t see maybe they’ve coddled blood ancestors. world really needs work together we’re making everything worse ourselves. It’s damn sure birds, dolphins, shit like Mars. It’s us. 

Today you, tomorrow me. Well, Corona lead lot circle jerks... fuck? got peace mind knowing won’t get flu giving shit others? Lame /s numbers Q2 2019 Q2 2020? PDF. excel sheet can't clear, understand numbers annualized full year. makes sense, quarters identical length, want measure GDP-per-time total GDP 90-93 days. affect percentage calculations. take public transit.

I also work home. Imagine thinking Florida better Cali 😂😂 crowds BLM protests encouraged. hear stories health care workers. Ive calling MPP daily voice objection absolute lunacy stripclubs, bars, schools open. Finally strip clubs closed still im furious. shit. he’s smart. mostly lockdown induced suicides. doubt. *ominous flu season sounds distance* don’t want fuck that. 

Fair enough, that’s call. unless end unusually bad case get hospitalized, odds likely exceptionally low sort permanent damage occur. say doubt support initiative ban cars, heartless. Whats important, people's lives get work? grandfather died car accident due irresponsible people like you. Youre absolutely right. R0 5 huge, IFR 3% even, would absolutely devastating world. R0 5 absence vaccine still unfortunately kill many many people. still potential hit Spanish Flu death levels, sadly. powered real good :) also cannabis alcohol tax. revenues increased pandemic. Join live discussion minutes others taking place wonder reasons Florida re-opening bars restaurants. think death rates ICU cases dropping, they? thought Florida would hit much harder knowing much older retired population. wonder what's going on. worried right able vote they're hospitalized...or dead? mean, think definitely gotten worse since left 16+ years ago. Going back visiting things seem aight guess family remaining pretty well really get full picture.  Hey remember him! See, explain everyone anti-mask. know what'd help make sure churches small businesses could stay open? Cloth everyone's face. That's it. easy cheap do-able.  ultimate Florida Man move. eventually beat COVID, even NZ dealt TKO. NZ also second wave, added benefit tiny island nation easily shut borders. likely 3rd subsequent waves. We, however, can't even afford move across town, let alone another state. everyone you.

Yeah bruv logic applies genius. Lot's people afford move whim often. everyone fucked economically pandemic.

Just can't move teeing shit mean whole world like you. *reported conclude didn’t need like this. much better would NYC tests early tested everyone country - anyone China. strongly ordered masks social distancing. closed schools businesses week sooner? Bet would still vote leave chance. Florida going ride wave stupidity bitter end shitty year been. 

There needs much stronger global laws consuming animals. Countries provide evidence international inspectors everything prevent dangerous markets operating face international sanctions. fine! :-) 

I think thought scarier actual deed. lot snowbirds come upper Midwest Northeast, Canada. realize a) New Zealand second wave, b) tiny island nation easily shut borders? still dealt COVID TKO likely 3rd subsequent waves. No, fairly low expectations him. definitely expected better CDC-- like good, clear, consistent messaging one. figured still competent people behind scenes could things like cohesive national testing plan. Thanks great comment. always love information never provided headline. Particularly last paragraph - usually *conveniently* left talking possibility long term heart effects due Covid 19 something someone could get masses mingling streets get herd immunity happening. know. Steal election. /s

While Americans struggle cold deadly winter Australians hit beaches without foreigners first time long time. Yeah well let’s see happens. People still required wear masks establishments, are. People still wearing masks everywhere. It’s state-level change, local municipalities still free stringent requirements, many do. much like world banned US US ban Florida people traveling states. 
The problem letting uneducated people choose destiny kill hell lot innocent people along way. Science politics Trump's supporters able turn upto ballot office? maybe mail in, oh wait trump says mail in, guess biggest fans able vote bed Most, all, substantial safety nets place, even guaranteeing 80% pay employers partially responsible for.

If vaccine becomes readily available, truly believe government would right say ""getting vaccine mandatory. citizens required get vaccine. choose get vaccine, put jail.

Yep. need get knew coming restrictions lifted people came Wisconsin escape ain’t!!! Florida’s numbers extremely low point say virus nonexistent. don’t understand concept natural herd immunity. order prevent everyone getting virus, get virus? missing here? case many high schools area. ones may already shut couple weeks. Nahh man guy haha I'd agree state gets flooded Northern Republican voters snowbird season. want scare away tourism money bring them. hate living sometimes.  like brag 

And there's problem. internet think I'm bragging whereas humbly offering advice young person. Take leave - clearly offended humble statement idk tell ya sweetheart. Again, recipient crying like are. Nah consistently one worst posters subreddit months get called anti-masker bring good points. saw initial infections much later many Western countries


Sigh, no, that's happened. US got initial infections exactly time: January/Febr. big wave hit BIT later Europe, US managed lockdown control spread 3-4 months. became clear lockdown chance eradication, lifted. 

US likely end worse Europe. much worse remains seen. all-things considered state level response many states different response many Western European countries  power corrupts absolutely?  conflate response pandemic lockdown ludicrous.

Yes, government help people time, opposed well, like ‘understandable’ considering political lemmings Florida. far away greatest risk factor COVID severity death age. tell democrats get equal voting right i’m wrong. thankful Redditors don’t run state. Jesus money saved moved Florida huge help. flu overwhelmed intensive care hospitals?

So sympathy say “life isn’t fair”

Same goes basically every billionaire name. Hardly given billions. Hahaha even aggravated homie. hate people like brag dumb shit like cares bro? everyones situation. Thank you!  Texas hospitalizations creeping even high death counts still.
Florida far behind lifting restrictions. They’re super ban happy, well. Yeh 1 month packing shite moving.

Point US population lives outside Southern tier, winter going kind people states. live Orlando kids public school system. 9.weeks (mid. October), anyone wants go virtual program face-to-face program option so. Everybody already submitted choices, around 45% kids back face-to-face mid-October (up 35%). definitely uniform across schools, schools numbers significantly higher, lower.  schools however please, schools requiring teachers back classroom teach ones coming back virtual ones time, smaller number kids class. 

But 35% kids started face-to-face day one, many classes already filled capacity elementary level. Again, schools choose representative schools, general observation experience friends multiple schools area. 
Interestingly, Florida small class sizes begin with. K-3, maximum number kids class 18, 4-8 22 9-12 25, never 25 kids class. There's slight work arounds, part true see class sizes higher this.

Even though masks mandated Orlando, entirely teacher enforced. teachers let kids masks day they're classroom, others require keep day. 

At middle high school level, majority classes blended beginning. still quite 100% virtual, instances teacher back classroom kids basically go room log zoom class middle school, teachers come back teach -face-to-face virtual time, they're really 12 kids classroom middle high school classes. Yep, big enough government support standing army large enough invade anywhere resources giant corporations want.

Big enough put nose private life, sex with, kind politics support, etc. strategical tactical thinking requires working have, had. things punish actually might made difference. key is, virus-free air room. Outside air works, heat cold problem. One solution filter air, cost fancy air filters prohibitive.  cheap effective solution is, box-fan good air filter.

Nobody worry, plan cook mask delivering (I immunocompromised family). 60% vaccination rate accually better normal circumstances, we're heading right direction. Even worse, wouldn’t need lockdowns people convinced use proven methods containing virus. Saying Donald Trump sucks Yep. takes longer insurance info process payment takes get actual shot.

Certainly majority them.  syphilis experiment.

I made quick search found ended 1972. experiment ended 48 years ago good reference get overall view regarding nowadays USA healthcare research treatment towards black people? bets long tighten restrictions again? think everyone agrees didn’t / didn’t OP’s post... now?

Opening bar full capacity anything close absurd yet plenty people places work places going better part year work completely disrupted. last months, little support pay bills prospects pick something new pays nearly same. 

That includes people crazy course also people masks, restrictions, decent government support ideals don’t change reality they’re equally faced that’s case. 

Add enough time little income, little little hope there’s great option either way. age group 20 49 99.98% survival rate (was age father? ). Maybe protect vulnerable stop destroying society? faint shots blood draws time . I’ve never fainted flu shot. worried, tell nurse concerned fainting ask lay sit 15 mins shot. Bring juice crackers. would stop vasovagal response. Fainting post shot type anxiety reaction Great plan, governor That’s said meant. topics mentioned aren’t completely untrue conspiratorial nature.

The detail/nuance absent right (and left times) frames topics. aren’t complete utter lunacy like Q R0 2 5 day duplication period would put us 1.3M daily cases 25th day.

I guess I'm saying is, ain't happening. current political climate toxic POC afraid trust stu

Go back thread, hell read comment history, trying attribute attitude ""current political climate."" also told us masks useless virus demanding them. trust him? experience actual vaccine hardly feel all, unlike tetanus MMR sting bit go in. people response get light headed kind injection/needle procedure. that's try tensing relaxing muscle arms legs asking lie sit moment injection make sure stable.   Given Zicam nose result permanent long term loss sense smell wouldn’t eager try it. Since smell big part taste sensations food tastes like textured cardboard paste lose sense smell.  Starbucks T-Mobile well. interesting see happens. Test positivity rates help correct this, though perfectly. process 'mopping up' digging lots asymptomatic cases may point - however realistically right now. Also don’t forget rumors, conspiracy theories, fear surrounding HIV/AIDS back 80s blacks, gays, drug users considered expendable!

A lot African Caribbean friends immigrated real fears vaccines obfuscation denial surrounding HIV Reagan ignoring it.

One run lot HIV created lab whites kill blacks. isn’t it’s origin story, conspiracy highly promoted Russians Cold War. absolutely understand fear there. US doesn’t exactly impeccable track record comes minorities. absolutely truth behind seemingly irrational fear. It’s white privilege fear kind thing tbh. Funny, literally everyone know “over it” doesn’t “have energy” anymore. Aka want sweet release death brings. Yes Im aware, comrade. riding mask lesser known/farther away trails cuz tourist congestion. 
Havnt gone anywhere since pandemic started. Doesn’t feel right travel create risks. Lol, clean cutting boards before? Blue suit = Violet wrong examples much detail

This argument? Ok then. I'm blaming ""the population."" fact, point population done well, relatively small incredibly damaging portion population fought tooth nail wearing masks, politicized every aspect pandemic insisted going engaging extremely risky behaviors. people spread virus dozens even hundreds others behaviors. events like Sturgis potentially led hundreds thousands new cases. Sturgis even remotely something could classify essential activity, purely self interest drove people attend. great many people fit profile above, sneering idea masks basic precautions. consequence, they've likely killed thousands innocent people. went away many! 200,000 Americans never worry Covid again. already see headlines 

“Comic-con goer dressed COVID-19 tested positive COVID-19.” Well I’m still hoping fully does. Whatever bullshit disconnection reality makes wonder blind spots. something staring eyes I’m unwilling see much might well all? go again... Florida man! Welcome 3rd wave! We're first!

As affecting male fertility, see reason restrictions frankly. many humans planet.

Myocarditis 2/2 viral infection isn’t uncommon, indications isn’t coxsackie-type picture fulminant myocarditis, rate, cardiac MRI plus troponins absence symptoms isn’t even necessarily slam dunk favor myocarditis.

All factors together basically mean really make concerted effort try follow patients clinic, you’re probably going end overdiagosing overtreating.

And top that, studies recently suggesting pre-existing cardiac signal MRI — again, doesn’t necessarily indicate myocarditis.

As pointed *every single time article similar articles posted*, even myocarditis (which again, necessarily true), *overwhelming* majority viral myocarditis resolve completely uneventfully. big deal? virus 99 percent survival rate. point even worry, it’s killing old people way anyway.

Except that's really different basically taxes. earn money, taxed earn it. spend money state sales taxes, get taxed again. business/person spent makes profit, pay tax profit. money filters individual income, pay tax it, eventually spend cycle repeats.

The money taxed money never used. Taxing inheritance lumping forms wealth transfer. survival rate catch covid-19 20s 99.997% according CDC numbers (better flu age group). absolute asshole. Florida pretty purple... Except that's happening.

The state getting covid rules game, however counties still making enforcing rules. 

In opinion, makes sense let counties respond manner needed counties. sort flexibility makes sense. Yup! Chicago. state government borrow money today 3% interest, use money fund roads/schools/health care/etc boost future economic production 5%, state come ahead 2%. state pay back debt eventually*, boosted growth interest costs net win. government spends borrowed money unproductive measures waste.

*: practice, governments often borrow money pay back debt due, creating never-ending cycle borrowing paying interest. still net-positive investments today pay future. department? believe they're talking oxygen cannisters/bottles - would use give people oxygen hospital. always lie though. want huge government. pretend small government comes social safety net. top lines page :)

but yeh, point ""big picture"" thing look really.... places well. some... much unfortunately probably necessary evil. Americans lost shit bought grocery stores like nuclear winter coming... bought medical supplies, would disastrous hospitals. seems like bought enough time get mask production moving.
It also doesn’t help changed wearing masks Trump didn’t get administration onboard start promoting base. literally reason masks became political issue... Yea thank you. life spent isolation life worth living.  man Grim Reaper. ghoul, time Halloween. Trump would put hairs chin ahead children. scary thing numbers aren’t “percent income” “percent item/food bought”. It’s “percent assessed value whole house” pay ever increasing percentage every single year live house forever. There’s really thing “free clear house” even pay mortgage. DeSantis far idiot, check resume. bought deep freezer stocking essentials Costco frequently. found Clorox wipes weekend first time 6 months. link Oh well, maybe taken serious like rest world? Eh, fuck it. Instead whine muh libertah make economy vs health false choice specific America. understand suspicion. feel sorry former co-workers selected vaccine review boon them, also curse. want best job possible, amount data made available review ability ask questions limited due urgent need vaccine.

It mean cannot good job, calculus FDA uses assess benefit risk make decision best interest public health pushed unfamiliar territory.

FDA hopefully issuing public guidance document give us insight next week two regarding EUA process COVID-19 vaccine. downward trend stopped 10 days ago. back 5 low reference point, that's all... This. cessation aid basically way force reopening. live Chicago announced easing restrictions today comes indoor dining bars becoming clear industry collapsing, even though numbers still great even open schools fall, trying justifying hoping none us remembered previous 'metrics based' opening guidelines espoused weeks prior. Granted far cry whatever hell Florida doing, definitely driven almost apocalyptic economic state in. mean, get desperation, let's pretend driven science concern people catching virus.   Yep. soon saw huge crowds packed together realized kill everyone covid fatigue went overdrive. called adults would fail marshmallow test So??? least million deaths TOP THAT. world spending *billions* dollars trying find cures treatments cancers heart disease. deaths obviously taken seriously. shouldn’t coronavirus deaths taken seriously, *if so* since neither cancer heart disease **contagious**?

Just want point another thing: rural area I'm talking already skews *heavily* elderly. relatives still live range 50 late 90s. low risk. would 0.4% chance dying. seem understanding all, extremely concerning.

Not mention, two choices ""close"" hospitals 80 bed place hour away, larger hospital *three hours* away. People age 50 high risk needing hospitalized, *need* survive corona.

I think concerned winter.

Is 'Karen"" BS driving numbers up? 


I'm Australian, forget downvote 👍🏽 ""I fear masks kids lead increase sociopathic tendencies."" H'what fuck talking boah?   We're even close scenario ""a lot"" people died. even close 1% scenario. sad truth excess death rate even normal more. hard argue pandemic justifies shutting whole country mind. highly doubt they're gonna get away      long unfortunately. concerning obscure things “essential” “not essential”.

My government labeled dumb job essential continued get ordered peoples homes essential workers lay taking advantage people still working 🤷🏽‍♂️

I quit caring shit long time ago, people seem left caring ones got opportunity work collecting paycheck, rest us accepted fate.

Open fuckin bars back let others stay home, it’s MONTHS. 0% thankfully.

Only six states steal die. 👍  like January magically get better. Desantis Florida Man, Governor Edition! see confusion come from. Infection fatality ratio used here, infection fatality rate. Rate percentage, whereas ratio well, ratio. ratio 1 equivalent percentage 100. I.e. take 0.052 figure 70s times hundred get 5.2%. sounds right. phased roll 'Rona Ron obviously pursuing herd immunity. Unethical stupid? Yes. true enduring vaccine either aforementioned. You’re good bro weren’t exposed long enough agree medical advice starts ""as white person""?

Oh don’t worry. repeating usual regurgitated lines.

Absolutely vaccine openly available going back normal  Whats free space already turkey freezer, going anywhere. Canada. We're always behind approving new things... Frustrating Would go doctor trust FDA though? wouldn't. care skin color doctor is, want politicizing care way whatsoever. Astronaut meme says Always got fight right(s) looked pulling qualify versus chunks avoid additional tax hit. Makes sense. Nice see people listen Dr. President Trump. Especially fractured politics really. Look NYC refuse open furloughing state employees taking money away them. might get results week CDC document itself:
———
The parameters scenarios:

Are estimates intended support public health preparedness planning.

Are predictions expected effects COVID-19.

Do reflect impact behavioral changes, social distancing, interventions.

So basically, going throw lowball numbers knowing people going read fine print misrepresent numbers accurate predictions severity COVID-19 via CDC. automod joke lol

I even deleted original response since contained word instant delete Maybe like well hard maybe too?
Some people find encouragement others. It’s ok agree. I'm serious. anxiety running high days. Northeast supposed handling virus well too. Almost Governor's part treasonous political coup trying increase infection rate undermine access to
voting. No, not. lift restrictions, put everyone risk, point people care believe risks feel comfortable going participating things like restaurants. basically giving free reign people responsible bulk virus spreading (going public without taking basic precautions) penalizing people spent last 6 months responsible. shot takes like 20 seconds tops tendies.  Yes. said, locked fully back March could actually sort normalcy sooner later. let money dictate action.

I believe online taxed well yes, still making money businesses (see: grocery food delivery, retail). Well don’t call Florida “Gods waiting room” nothing Lol seriously 😂 casino windsor table games, buffet, hotel. slots spaced far apart small amount people. seems harmless enough. You’re right India much less obesity, helps.

However, Indians aren’t verge starvation. It’s country deep poverty, economic development past decades prevented lot extreme food scarcity. Less 15% Indians undernourished shit. also obesity lower cardiorespiratory fitness, that's probably contributing too, can't tell black people get shape, would considered centered poverty discrimination.

Do example MSM discriminatory towards black people? ever bad March they're testing keeping track it. warning take measures needed. article summer 2021? ""if Republicans, nobody would get sick""

These fucking blue team statements stupid. saying agree single word red team zealots say, repub talking points reason people getting sick? Yeah that’s also good point aren’t Ny March April etc horse stable.  Everyone bails 10pm UK. House parties banned. guess better curfew full blown lockdown.

Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial also biggie. big mac?? Millions losing livelihood worldwide many falling food insecurity. People missing cancer screenings kind medical treatment cost lives.

Case closed. reads like colonoscopy bill spouse following coronavirus guidelines strictly. inside anyone else's home since March, one inside apartment. socializing fully outdoors physical distancing, diligent mask usage.

My mother (over 60 yrs old) lives across country wants visit Christmas. typically stays us visits. 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment though. There's really way separated isolated.

At moment still feel like unsafe us stayed place flying (unless 14 day quarantine airbnb hotel something). wrong this, current guidelines basically suggest anyone stay you? Right I've able find articles May June advising people guests stay unless separate areas.

Taking one step further, let's say stays airbnb hotel. Would also unsafe drive car since six feet apart could potentially inhaling other's breath particles?

Any articles, studies, links, etc. appreciated. little effect COVID, Karens know do. WAY consideration FL gov people think, meetings scientists doctors opened. 


We follow Florida's lead soon enough, odd may seem. R.I.P. Florida... Grad school right discussed part Research course honestly blame them. ""study"" major impact. Washington State resident checking in. addition gas tax, property tax $4,800 per year pay 8.6% sales tax everything buy food. I'm American expect response anemic either.

I live outside Boston, area get hit hard early on, within weeks Lombardy. lot people close ties Italy, kept eye news carefully. lock nearly hard nearly long. We're better US, still rather poorly compared countries.

The thing really scares relatives Midwest. never took seriously. still think hoax (unless they're ranting proof biblical End Times). rural area hit yet, I'm afraid they're taking zero precautions. 

And that's part we're badly general-- every response localized, good bad, federal plan basically nonexistent. We're still struggling enough N95 masks nurses. risk people work return months ago can't get ahold medical-grade masks protection. Kids going back school now, plans vary *town* often poorly thought (e.g. contact tracing, plan number cases might trigger shut down, plan high risk kids teachers besides going cloth mask praying). I'm continually horrified actions. would trump listen health experts? really. needs go. might consider telling tell parents, will. it. may like person life, hard, sounds like prefer surround different types people anyway. make living die trying would always shitshow.

The US lot *very* long-standing issues caused this. significant extent, Trump symptom rather cause America's problems.  expect country go way Florida soon already.

You meant states there's income tax. states income tax, survive that. Fauci one world's foremost coronavirus experts. scientists actually working 
the coronavirus rarely time plaster TV magazine covers.

 guy show absolutely inkling understanding data trends show pretty consistent trends epidemic curves different places. I'm left wonder whether he's innumerate, lazy, lying. clinical trials distinguish “experimental” “observational”. I’m saying observational studies cannot used evidence, it’s strong evidence typically requires studies vs experimental evidence guide clinical management  looked like dude blue shirt mullet second, slightest bit surprising. Please stop trying normalize government Victoria. Nobody wants that, we're going accept it. Well, also consider efficacy vaccine. vaccine proven 95% effective different story one 50% effective. And, many vaccines take awhile become fully effective. oh yikes, yeah sounds right :/ Good thing article never says findings indicate need ongoing investigation long-term cardiovascular consequences COVID-19,” authors conclude.  state melting down. Basically done start snowbird season. They're absolutely desperate return, even though death sentence many them. feds need pass aid bill rather try shove justice election. People can’t afford stay home anymore. Many states depend tourism survive. No. expect Pelosi anything either. said earlier, ""it affordable"". attitude parties rona circle jerks...

Clinical Trial Transparency

The FDA FDA amendment act terms registering trials atrocious. FDA needs fine companies. 
http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.d7373 first months coronavirus pandemic, World Health Organization estimated sick individual infecting average two others. “basic reproductive number” — (R0) pronounced “R naught” — reveals contagious disease is.  new research Duke University says number likely twice big, one infected individual bringing average 4 5 people them, according study published Sept. 24 journal PLOS One.  findings also show governments 57 countries analyzed 20 days first reported cases enforce preventive measures social distancing face mask guidelines prevent widespread infections deaths — take advantage of.

This NZ done well. benefit first cases arriving relatively late, responded quickly arrived.   

It's easier treat cancer Stage 1 Stage 4 lot less fight easier attack. Good luck getting Republicans deniers understand this. think pandemic anywhere near over, ""behind us"", delusional. People continue infected, sadly people continue die enough people vaccinated virus slow spread. continue peaks valleys cases, hospitalizations, deaths months come. 

The CDC said approximately 10 percent American population exposed infection. Locations throughout United States experience second, third peak fall, winter, next spring. likely even seen worst virus yet. We're probably going see fall, winter. I'm wrong, I'm wrong, hope wrong. Holy shiet 700k excess deaths 20 countries... probably means real total least double what's reported rn since there's countries hiding data. I'm glad also holy fuck people take Governer getting flu shot get flu shot. Yup- think San Diego keeps “mysteriously” running 6.9 case rate (if goes 7 everything shuts again) running super super high one day deadline??

No federal aid = cessation unemployment benefits = stimulus = PPP halt business bankruptcies = ability pay landlords/equity firms = total financial collapse.

That’s they’d rather risk overrunning hospitals - choice. economic fallout without Fed stimulus might actually worse (including deaths) shut opposed stay open point.

This Feds need stop bitching dragging pass new stimulus. Everyone is. Even northeast need start living lives. fear virus, stay home/wear mask Dr. Dr. President trump. Remember uncle went MIT gets PhD passively that. Synonymous *mouth breathers.* people *ironically* wear masks noses. trust pharmaceutical companies FDA????

With said, control individual situations try help many people come contact with, oh yeah, post occasional rant reddit...this literally left with...  That's cases. even logic?  Swedish goverment 

They can't shit this. literally decided countless experts country, no, nothing herd immunity, know that.

Hey neighbor! Well, lots people members Republican cult, conditioned believe fantasies. That’s works. find support basically claim know Google it. 

But disregarding second, googling ”Covid mutations symptoms long term” yields absolutely result even mentions possibility mutations virus causing long term symptoms. Instead, *all* articles listed say thing said, mutations real concern infection rates, death rates vaccine development.

Concerning blood type, Harvard article mentions it. also concludes it’s probably thing. You’re numbers seem taken thin air.

[90% individuals recover COVID-19 enduring side-effects following important remember people have COVID-19 recover quickly. potentially long-lasting problems from COVID-19 make even important reduce spread disease following precautions wearing masks, avoiding crowds keeping hands clean.

Organs may affected by COVID-19 include:

- **Heart.** Imaging tests taken months recovery from COVID-19 have shown **lasting damage heart muscle, even people experienced mild COVID-19 symptoms.** **may increase risk heart failure heart complications** future.

- **Lungs.** The type pneumonia often associated with COVID-19 can cause **long-standing damage** tiny air sacs (alveoli) lungs. resulting scar tissue lead **long-term breathing problems.**

- **Brain.** **Even young people,** COVID-19 can cause **strokes, seizures Guillain-Barre syndrome** — condition causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also **increase risk developing Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease.**

**Blood clots blood vessel problems**

COVID-19 can make blood cells likely clump form clots. large clots cause heart attacks strokes, much heart damage caused by COVID-19 is believed stem small clots block tiny blood vessels (capillaries) heart muscle.

Other organs affected blood clots include lungs, legs, liver kidneys. COVID-19 can also weaken blood vessels, **contributes potentially long-lasting problems liver kidneys.**

[All information taken Mayo list lingering maladies COVID-19 longer varied doctors could imagined. Ongoing problems include fatigue, racing heartbeat, shortness breath, achy joints, foggy thinking, persistent loss sense smell, damage heart, lungs, kidneys, brain.

**Pain lingers**
A subset COVID-19 patients experiences ongoing symptoms complications organ damage, and researchers proposing reasons some of (bottom). Scientists trying identify suchsymptoms, common are, long last,who’s risk, treat prevent them.

**1 Brain fog**
Difficulty thinking occur acute COVID-19 infection. virus may damage brain cells, inflammation brain body may also cause neurologic complications. viral infections also lead brain fog.

**2 Shortness breath**
Doctors eyeing lung heart complications including scarring. Patients become critically ill COVID-19 seem likely lingering shortness breath, **those mildcases also risk.**

**3 Heart arrhythmia**
The virus harm heart, doctors concerned long-term damage. How heart heals after COVID-19 could help determine whether a patient develops an irregular heartbeat.

**4 Hypertension**
Some patients high blood pressure acute infection, **even cases relatively mild people previously healthy,** possibly virus targets bloodvessels heart cells.

The virus ravages heart, example, multiple ways. Direct invasion heart cells damage destroy them. Massive inflammation affect cardiac function. virus blunt function ACE2 receptors, normally help protect heart cells degrade angiotensin II, hormone increases blood pressure. Stress body fighting virus prompt release adrenaline epinephrine, also “have deleterious effect heart,” says Raul Mitrani, cardiac electrophysiologist University Miami collaborates Goldberger.

But patients affected without apparent risk factors: paper week in JAMA Cardiology found 78 100 people diagnosed COVID-19 cardiac abnormalities heart imaged average 10 weeks later, often inflammation heart muscle. Many participants study previously healthy, even caught virus ski trips, according authors.

Collectively, “long-haulers” describe dozens symptoms, including many could multiple causes, fatigue, joint pain, fever. “It’s time give voice huge population patients,” Akrami says ... Iwasaki especially struck number **young, healthy, active people**—people like Akrami—who fall long-hauler category. others struggle find ways help them, wonders might head symptoms.

For things like this, good idea keep mind things may changed vs. infection, especially relatively early pandemic. 

I think lot people would say fatigue and/or problems concentrating noticeably higher degree compared pre-pandemic times. COVID much higher death rate flu, going wipe whole family. closest situation I’ve heard Fusco family New Jersey. big family (like 11 kids one line) lost 5 older members. made national news extreme outliers. LA whatever want.

At onset COVID, LA enacted COVID state emergency, days later hosted 20,000+ people world LA marathon. Free version There's New York City Sheriffs? That's like saying there's Virgin Islands mounted Highway Patrol. Yeah sucks don’t really option considering widespread vaccination may happen next summer.  Could someone please educate me, circle get blasted referring number.

I'm told method US calculates COVID death toll different country. people die (not due to) added total.

If so, inflate numbers beyond fair comparison?

Could someone better knowledge help understand difference please? Yep Modi gonna Modi. Coronaviruses believed mutate like influenza suggesting widely believed accepted mutations SARS-CoV2 anything said entirely misinformation. Please stop spreading Dude watching couple YouTube videos doesn’t make expert lol Well hard compare China report honest numbers infected dead. dozens incinerators rolled Wuhan inspected city cleaned things nicely report covid deaths flu deaths. NA education. thats Babiš said #bestincovid. least social media pictures 2020 event communicate something specific poster, parents. ""unable work""  

""long term medical care""

I hope good job pay medical care. C'mon, brainless humans!! Yet China's ""official"" infected numbers low. Hmmmm! would still alright they'd pick like 2 weeks earlier (unconditionally without nuts internet know better experts, like always). Looking social media, people know socialization recreation vacationing saintly nurses work Covid wards. (Seriously. Including partying like 2019, #WeAllHavetheSameGerms.) Followed closely doctors teachers. 

And I'm personally still socializing eating taking vacations yet, I'm definitely restricting shopping bare essentials anymore. pensions taxable country, social security-- funded taxes *you already paid*--is also taxed income. u risking kinds exposure bodily fluid animal. blood, mostly. also excrements more. ""Pandemic fatigue"" issue since March, roughly. folks started protesting demanding economy ""reopened.""

My take this: fallen influence powerful, need believe government corrupt failing nature. *only* recourse act like things normal, go work consume. 

They denial. [They practicing denialism, self-defensive fool's bargain: betting whole world wrong pandemic, face uncomfortable, externally inside themselves. China deserves special attention world stage months spent (knowingly) downplaying virus.

and downplaying virus. Thank god Trump recognized divorced USA Chinese bootlicking “We’re opening entire state!”-Florida
“We’re disappointed see public health guidance provided multiple occasions disregarded many.” - Also Florida Governors supposed unconditionally listen health experts. supposed take perspective consideration, governors also balance needs businesses, schools, budgets, etc. agree certainly economic factor but...I work bank. Let tell that, deposit-number-wise, (in lower-class working area South), overall deposit numbers extra unemployment benefits. People know fact job years somehow getting unemployment benefits. I've seen people intentionally throw jobs away get unemployment benefits. regret later? Probably, they've traditionally lower-paying job making double make work -at risk!- stay home shop...well that's tough pill swallow... isn’t surprising. Children little humans virus airborne. Sending enclosed spaces poor ventilation long periods time good idea. Never been. Every morning come reminds people dying never know get seriously sick this. 

I almost friends taking seriously come here, get lured sense normalcy something stupid.

Florida sounds like similar live now. people take seriously.  Swedish goverment could tell ""experts"" suck impliment restrictions anyways, Denmark that.

The danish Government needed approval parliament order introduce nationwide lockdowns. see something like happening Swedish parliament anytime soon? Early lockdown. Huge numbers tests. Contact tracing. Informing public. Controlling spread. Preventative measures. Massively scaled-up production essential items.  Uh, hello pot, meet kettle. simply stated plenty countries handled fine without giving context whatsoever. go beyond social cooperation holding social contract, least half Americans seem fundamentally incapable doing. government power U.S. lack fundamental long term thinking ability see need ""greater good"". I'm removing blame ""but muh freedumbs"" people, they're giant part problem, got point shit rolls hill giant American blind spot known ""lack empathy"" metastasized degree going crush us eventually without substantial interventions. 2020 style swatting we're pretty much right schedule too. ""Those fail learn past, doomed repeat it."" would describe effects time covid positive today? see effects fading day day believe long term permanent thing?

Sorry asking negative question. I'm scared virus.  testing it?

Wait, let guess: *to* test Ummmm...because Governor told Politicians care power human lives. also smart, could backfire badly. where? I'm mostly tired people stupid. would many less problems people just..... Didn't. 

I'm even area that's technically bad admittedly I'm probably better 2nd job what's going one I'm likely long shit continues. ok cool.

But time people really frustrating listening people say dumbest things see dumb shit.

Like 7 people recently got sick I'll check in, make sure masks, get need be... take masks *because like wearing them*

That's works. wear masks building. temperature checks foolproof. People take precautions outside work like even could still unfortunately get sick end carrying.

We sanitizer wipes different kinds everywhere remind people use come in/back in, need keep using day. Even got bunch sinks washing.

I’m saying it’s wrong way look — Black Death awesome economy medieval Europe long term, problem human devastation can’t measured economic terms. lingering COVID-related health problems lower life expectancy, could net positive economy. doesn’t mean it’s “good” let happen. mean damage? lingering side-effects little difficult notice attribute family/your recovery.

For starters, could reduced lung capacity might noticeable active. CT scan lungs could show anomalies caused infection. could damage heart, kidneys, liver, hypertension diagnosed follow-ups since mild case. could experiencing 'brain fog' heightened depression anxiety might attributed neurologic impact virus. people recovered covid start pandemic still sense smell/taste returned.

Especially less severe cases, potential lingering symptoms may easy attribute infection individual who's recovered, seem unrelated focus attention (acute respiratory symptoms). reality, virus affects much respiratory system.

I want keep spamming comment thread, look response user responded comment want citations claims. Definitely take word it; read articles linked. Looks like Light Death Note going field day... Nine ten recovered COVID-19 patients experience side-effects, study shows

Very misleading headline I'm afraid. actual figures 5762 patients, 879 (15%) said suffering least one side-effect, 86 (1.5%) said not, 4797 (83%) respond. 

It also unclear whether 5762 representative people catching disease, whether hospital patients. similar surveys hospital patients. Sadly 😔 Seriously. selfish. Everyone attendance blame well. Damn, bought 70% Kohl's. know resting head that. 2% infected US. 2% spread across ages. likely real number, let’s pretend 10% infected. say 40% Cardiac injury correct. 40% 10% cardiac injury-again-across age ranges. Realistically, information know myocarditis, *most* recover own. arguments sake, let’s say half lasting effects myocarditis. 2% US population....spread amongst age demographics. concerned wiping entire generations?!

Nope. didn’t learn shit states’ mistakes in-person school started back up. we’ve economic fallout, we’ve decided make nothing infect everyone anyway. case numbers going explode within weeks. I’m worried texas headed fully reopening even though we’re remotely woods. Started reading, writer decided get political within first paragraph. Sorry, want facts, without political spin agenda. I'll research website scientists report facts without whining sitting white house. positivity rate going wrong way too, 29 states testing enough. CDC said cases underreported 10x. obviously deaths least 20x underreported. simple exponential math. Sorry understand it. Florida. bad things go happen. Good luck! Let’s together believe professional athletes physicals season begins possibly (player trades etc.) - team physicians give physical athlete. condition heart one many listened/looked necessary....NBA player Elton Brand one athlete remember diagnosed heart condition 2015 subsequently led retirement ... pre covid - point being, pre-existing heart issues would documented pre covid...hence whole “maybe already inflamed” argument seems flawed could try suggesting move glasses couple mm nose, making sure nose clip tight. takes little bit experimentation perfectly possible stop fogging issue. 5% population planet 20% deaths pandemic. needs sink anybody getting ready vote current administration. think Stanley cup super bowl.

Yeah gotta get jollies tasteless saw guy catchers mask walking restaurant weekend. Funny hell honest. counterpoint...

1) spread virus spread larger period time continued mitigation efforts (masks, distancing, etc.) Hospitals necessarily get slammed. saying best option, hospitals overloaded guarantee

this headline trash. Uh... nature work way.  

Depending species, many sharks eat fish. vaccinations, sure. 

For ""natural herd immunity"" - no, except tiny communities. large scale. think Midwest states barely first wave though, peaking later Northeast, west coast, southern states. containment measures like quarantines, herd immunity. Thank god closed pubs 10pm! Otherwise would 100,000! allegedly Alyssa Milano guess long-term moving average? folks came March April example, still experiencing side effects today, would absolutely consider long-term comparison viruses. yeah, 50 years, 6 months long-term. :-) Best guess: people yell heard music, could increase level virus asymptomatic infections expel talking.

Dozens. Question, why? caused it?

There massive interventions right now, social distancing forth.

We know throat temperature affect biochemistry seasonal viruses affect infectivity. Could random kids eaten ice cream infection? know sounds dumb, seriously unless identify kids fall prey this, bad.

Granted, kids fall prey flu know why. COVID kills far far flu, upper age brackets. Frankly, far less flu lower. weird. kids die, without obvious underlying conditions. Why?

Important answer, unanswered. That's even close saying. saying information needed make statements whatsoever. 

This particular study's results appear extreme, alignment previous estimates hospitals surveys/polls Drunk people exactly socially responsible customers. issue saying 99% survival rate gives layman false understanding deadly is. comparison, flu kills effectively zero - .0012%. Nobody would claim breast cancer 'nothing', survival rates localized breast cancer *higher* best rates COVID. 

It's framing data that's issue. point gonna wait till every family doubters seen least one family member die. they’ll shift “WHY DIDNT ANYONE ANYTHING?!” much improvement least may board with, dunno, listening medical experts last. need understand community mask reduce chance bit, give immunity. FFP3/N95+ medical mask protect coronavirus. One reason social distancing rules need maintain social distancing minimum 1.5-2m, away, better. way, touching doorknob eyes bad idea, point keep washing hands rule.

Watching [Madrid gives headache. 3 small tables alongside one another, stacked guests people without mask still passing close by. surprise outbreak going on....... people feel dizzy like they'll pass otherwise health issues. know Spain, message Italian government consistent throughout pandemic. PM good job conveying seriousnes problem media covered situation inside hospitals (especially North). People listened. mum visited UK summer horrified see people openly flouting rules face covering shops trains. said Italy allowed in.  people say obvious, totally obvious.

In land live less worth Sandwich ground.... PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — least three new players, five new personnel Tennessee Titans tested positive COVID-19 according reports.

The Steelers scheduled play Titans Sunday Tennessee.

The #Titans three new player positives five new personnel positives COVID-19, sources tell @MikeGarafolo. Titans Vikings, hosted Sunday, suspend person club activities starting today.

— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) September 29, 2020

Mike Garafolo reports Titans Vikings hosted Sunday, suspend person club activities starting today.

No word Steelers positive cases may mean Sunday’s game. mouth breathers wearing like still reduce risk /s Was...are thy saying dropped? virus weird man organization investigating gov,t releasing wants wants help. Tomosin 

*Tomosin*? mean troponin myosin? time look up. Would study handy? not, search later. (The fact got 22 upvotes bit concerning). Wow, I'd embarrassed even attend wedding there. best bet would confirm list getting condition information hospital, ask nurse fly home. Call back twelve hours later ask thing next shift nurse.

Then better idea using statistics happened common sense? would love believe case. would love think point, governing bodies going say, “The risk Covid still - vaccine significantly lower before. this, risk low enough society return normal, lifting restrictive measures”. 

However, it’s fear long new Covid cases popping country, expected live locked down, masked up, socially distanced dystopia. God damn school GP literally get close examine sore throat (Tonsillitis) without face protection back February seriously conflating advice assumptions? relatively high quality online surveys nowadays. many trash, that's true. city already wouldn’t mean too? [Source. doesn’t false positives, tests picking insanely small bits viral load counting positive realistically amount virus absolutely nothing. article uses sensationalized unproven virus data dramatic words get watch loads ads article trying scroll. Exactly! they're getting pissed getting better people give shit anymore.  ""A wedding?? Murderers!!!"". Cringe? 12 year old girls? present like young adult actual experience beyond working shifts local grocery store think figured posting random quotes movie that’s “like totally deep”. 


If I’m wrong apologize, may want consider present Take grain salt (until make reliable antibodies test) know 100% it, suspect strongly time tests readily available general public assuming I'm right:

 COVID lot severe mental side effects personally. harder think objectively, severe emotional turmoil always surface. found far reactive things, angrier, slower realize I'd misheard partner misinterpreted something colleague might said. time serious falling mother culminated getting restraining order her. Short version way WAY top /r/insaneparents style shit around time I'm one worst emotionally mentally challenging times life. suspect infected well went deep end usual.

A solid explanation thought could explain reaction I've got minor asthma made worse COVID fucked ability breathe sleeping made cranky, theory shot shit breathing evened still issues regulating emotions focusing. reason simple: people taking care themselves, therefore increase infections family groups. need fucking experts tell us wearing respiratory protective equipment respiratory holes makes fucking useless??? society gotten would rather take risk getting virus isolate another 6 months. Living fear long healthy. unless something recently changed, ban ends 1st. 6. already nationwide teacher shortage, killing faster make new ones helpful. DeSantis sure spent enough time arguing masks necessary playing impacts virus months. also used emergency relief funds late 2019 fund ICE, funds could used single worst economic downturn countries history. 


And lifetime situation can't balanced budget, maybe increase taxes pay it. Sure, I'm sure super popular cult following taught taxes worse death, IMO ethical letting people die streets wants secure reelection. like three months behind Japan's bullshit.

Which, recently, even Devi Sridhar said ""doing great Bushido"". Blech, gag me. Looking you, money printer go brr  Like assumed people leave whim? Haha. see triggered snowflake! seem overly angry. Can’t keep mullet fresh hair salon closed. get it... report businesses employees wearing nose state, ones employees wear masks all. sure whether anything state online form report businesses for. know one small business county shut supposedly getting reported feeling business already failing publicly made statement excuse. way tell think. simply chasing people telling stop illegal. People could this. Get new mask wire strip pinch top nose. Pretty much requirement glasses wearers opinion use control group infected. Either way, kids died underlying conditions. 

How many. really want come good name people. See everywhere. Nah. They’ll still take money poor people.

Say louder people back. Lol first half, gonna lie probably think breathing nose breathing mouths. aren’t, unless trained opera singers woodwind players. advocating nobody recovers fully. merely one careful stateing recovered yet facr long-term effects covid-19 - infection/illness. Long term effects take long term develop takes even longer get knowledge thos longterm effects. one aware possibility side-effects brush outright merely little cough unusual bruise. people don’t live 95, do. grandfather 94 now, even retirement communities Florida, vast majority friends died quite ago. Many replacement couples activity circles ALSO died.

How many WW2 vets still around? 3-5% maybe? (Wild ass guess) wish someone would explain logic. Especially even originally know teh improper way enough people wear SEE wearing right. right, fuck it. Massive deaths health problems, let's move on. Especially since Trump plans gut Social Security non-elderly recipients, aka orphans disabled people.  people responsible health well (the trump led government) trying make trump look bad..

Huh? still keep remembering fat lady 40s checkout line grocery store, told another one ""I pull nose feel breath walking little bit"". makes sad mad that's justification also, there's lot people Mexico use mask double chin hammock. Sweeden run authoritarians??? 9300 lot less 200,000.

Either way, kids died underlying conditions. Why? needs answer. Sounds like they're facts me. We've passed 200k milestone, 7 days **average** death count around 750 people, Trump's comments Woodward literally recorded.

The thing might reach many ""Trump-lovers"" starting look factual information virus. Unless you’re professional opera singer woodwind player, circular breathing task nose hanging out. think you’re exhaling nose, are. Leadership example - great idea. stopped weeks ago, unfortunately, least live. believe see, hear (paraphrasing real quote ~~Big Brother~~ Trump). too. Somehow wife baby didn’t (seem to) get sick. faced mortality grace. main concern them. 

Mentally, facing potential death positive experience. first rush “but xyz”, but, death funny way cutting right bullshit point. 

I good, great. regret teaching wife shoot firearms (at time facing widespread shortages due supply chain issues). 

Finding are, core all, superfluous BS stripped away - empowering experience. 

I hope everyone sincere gut check point lives - hopefully expense health. Spell “vaccines” right maybe listen opinion herd immunity Imagine getting degree teacher treated like fast food worker. Oof. 200k excess deaths normally have. killed hands humans rather virus, saying meh, .02%, need worry. week saw lady melting outside publix grocery store let without mask.


Without threat able call police person violating mask mandate, people going ignore it.


And sadly call police, police going show without masks too... police department state even made mandate anyone entering station needs take mask escorted property... know that’s impression give posts, comments, replies. don’t catch whiff empathy you. stop speaking acting every single swede failure. us trying very, hard start. honestly feel empathetic want things get better, you’ve failed communicate that. what? 😂😂 link says, buddy. No, current evidence suggests infections typically happen people breath space infected person. longest virus survive air 3 hours lab conditions, according New England Journal Medicine study, even probably sufficiently large amount cause infection. Surfaces considered significant source spread since virus decay exponentially time. underweight healthy, need mention people already know that. mean hold informal, online survey? says targeted 5762 recovered patients. Hard say without actual paper. It’d smart maybe start considering taking step back positivity rate gets 5% piece advice requires make assumption, bad advice. assumed anyone uproot go somewhere better. 

Interesting think stick beak recipient accepted advice absolutely fine it? think important (you're not)?  assumed anyone uproot go somewhere better. 

That's read - can't help misinterpreted bragging assumption. offered one alternative mind think important wade shit everything. Must suck you. linked article says 50% people covid ate last two weeks support view restaurants open. evidence restaurants involved spread, it’s independent fact. It’s like saying 50% new cases involve someone wears polka dotted ribbons hair - would say it’s concerning people wear hair ribbons? Correlation causation.

We contact tracing stats restaurants covid spread you’re looking sort data. Typically around 15% cases traced back spread restaurants. yes thread lady mainly. full-proof

Foolproof 3 players, far least. I'm sure NFL going handle situations positives come back week. like baseball schedule bunch double-headers make missed game games. There's lot wiggle room NFL schedule rescheduling. true need wear nose plugs effective masks. article obviously bit hyperbolic Napoli, South Italy, actually tell sometimes wear correctly, times I've seen even staff shops wearing properly! think fanboys take vaccine said so

edit:classic reddit think it’s telling it’s usually people saying back March way Summer Fall seasons would affected ones saying next summer pandemic TOTALLY over. 

It’s also hilarious “pandemic optimists” usually post WSB stakes financial markets lol study Korea. largely people Korean heritage Also looks absurd coworkers shit day. don’t get it, much weakling? wear mine day. life threatening thank everyone mentioned different side effects Corona Virus;Covid19. states enforce covid restrictions, time states, lift covid restrictions. Boy, country fucked up. Well, least it’s gravedigger. think talking cast Fox Friends actually. agree need ubi esp this. I’m charge things looks like it’s impossible hold leaders anything tho  missed point entirely. You’re brilliant think Herd mentality answer along Florida....sigh. Great minds think alike, sub group. vote me.  ""We're 11th we're 12th"". comment.


No, ""everyone"" agrees. Sweden want look total deaths early numbers bad. Instead, Tegnell Giesecke said ""wait see"". 7 months later total deaths still awful. bluff up. try keep inventing new things.

Sweden used right wing populist strategy. strategy similar US, UK Brazil response. relaxed, ignoring warning signs, denial, refusing take obvious countermeasures, ""thinking economy"". Who's economy? Swedes broke unemployment record levels. Wallenberg's economy maybe. Right we're even worse US UK, they're senseless enough keep campuses open *still* denying masks September.

Sweden hardly country paying sick leave, that's detail makes Swedish strategy ""extremely left wing"". 

Really, funneling money middle class people middle class people government takes cut nothing leftism first place. yep, that's thought. 

Ok, goodbye troll, blocking now. best try simply stay far away nose-flaunters. already try keep distance regardless mask wearing - even though everyone seems think cotton face mask means they're safe rub elbows... anyone wearing mask indirectly, me, simply means they're noncompliant, avoided. also never know saying something cause scene, tend try avoid altogether, keep distance nearby strangers, etc. think know petitioning behind closed doors. election season. going get accurate picture going inside party looking surface. understand this. possibly true covering mouth equivalent covering it?

I agree there's less protection proper wear, there's clearly protection mask. shitty framing help convince anyone.  is.

/s Great idea. I’d throw free ice cream pizza parties. Definitely experience. gave blood months ago noticed nurse also wearing glasses. asked keeps fogged glasses said bend nose strip fit contours face. fog free ever since. actually care mouth covered put droplets th air nose uncovered they'll one gets covid. thought bad $1500/mo. I’m sorry you. logic tells - ok, it’s protect others ones around I’m grabbing take - can’t pull nose minute I’m alone??”*

The problem droplets you’re exhaling *linger* air little people inhale even you’ve left gone another aisle. wear mask properly *consistently* catch exhaled droplets reduce amount virus you’re potentially exposing others to. sounds like first article, HHS corrupted CDC fought back compromised wording weekly reports. That's great, second article considerably worse. Thanks sharing. Twitter-savvy friend tells become known dick-nosing. get angry things can't control? election Oh one ones making political? productive /s

You know else preventable? large mass gatherings (protests) people may may wearing mask properly (under nose, pulled etc). 

But doubt problem right?

sorry mother died. give shit politically either way. cared kids properly educated person virtual working including special needs son cared kids got dental work done needed wellness check ups. cared son got train person dance pursue career arts. went back outside took lockdown. 

Had jack shit political reasons. welfare children. ""trumps"" anyone else book. Sorry. not? people I've come across total mouth breathers.. course it’s wearing mask. part body bodily fluids easily spread. It’s pathetic signs everywhere wash hands. Wasn’t kindergarten lesson?! alone, right thing. I’ve similarly self isolating. way use social media, don’t see stupid memes. Fuck “friends.” stop logging Facebook. Tell people want stay contact email/text/call want talk.

You protecting children Don’t worry “good” teacher. Kids always learning, catch specific details need to. kids would homeschool. don’t talk people don’t want make feel bad making choices. But, would 100% kind homeschool / distance learning 2020-2021 school year.

Think like this: want protect them, right? can’t protect get sick. Even mild COVID-19 give long term fatigue. prevent getting sick? you’re doing, sending kids in-person learning. **Protect kids COVID-19 protect yourself, protect them.** told Poland strict regulations mask use allowing people leave homes? Check post history. Also name.  ironic.

Because spread coronavirus CIA also gone quite slow. Even .00002% people age group dying, way tell causes die. Like there's info yet x=higher chance dying, etc

This everyone care seems overlook. Sorry, finish thought. case *is* happening think psychology events impacting someone's life much still quite present people's minds. Hence feeling need anything different lives, even though time do. “You catch again.” - love, science use piece paper towel open every door way til I'm desk, like people magically washed hands washroom desk. interesting, research continually done. classical theory telomeres sort buffer. protect DNA becoming damaged cell replicating. But, many times replication telomeres become short protect errors. forms foundation telomeres theory aging. That's true, also less international travel seeding influenza across country. visiting Chicagoland. almost looked odd masked wanting eat outdoor area rather inside restaurant. would helped workers certain affected industries, even generous UBI wouldn’t bailed small businesses saw revenue drop $0 months (years?) end. funding come federal government, city state governments required run balanced budget tax revenue collapsed. It’s fair criticize public health response Cuomo De Blasio, local policy response could averted economic carnage. Nobody needed expert tell put something top mask act breath deflector. pinch use kleenex. absolutely knew would happen. unknown number cases must acceptable them. children’s deaths. stat ticks discernably, they’ll revise plan.  first generation two were.  got there! Haha oh definitely, really gotta whale get stay bent, there're also really crappy ones ear loop falls mask randomly

but I've also coworkers like ""how mask slip"" like ""there's wire top part bend"" didnt problem anymore ditto Old school septic systems 100% back abused. Source brother law IBS moved year septic problems started. think might broken point. specifically responding going bars gatherings maskless.

Not talking everyone burned pandemic...heck I’m burned out. special kind dumb think wearing mask makes someone less man. people place condoms testicles “safe sex.”

This line shamelessly stolen another clever redditor. need see label Isn’t incarceration rate roughly? Nope - already virus moment cannot catch again. actually safest around with.
Obviously category wearing mask totally utterly pointless exercise. legally mandated cannot avoid going least sorta-comply Agreed per capita deaths per day currently worst South America according Oxford data. Edit - here's top 15 7-day rolling average.

Who knew. found article Philippines interesting info:

To date, total 21 cases reinfection Covid-19 recovered reinfected Covid-19.

“As yesterday, 28 September 2020 – five remain active, 16 others successfully recovered second third time reinfection,” PCG said.

My guess immunity short lived. Every time I’m new building bathroom door opens always wonder designed place. open door back, otherwise gotta use sleeve, part shirt, lob paper towel far enough hit trash that. HS bathrooms like lot airports door went around wall get in. primarily Italy got hit first got infected most?

TLDR: lower infection rates immunity? work, also makes look really stupid Treatment better PPE nursing homes better etc.

But yes, accept hundreds thousands Americans likely die this. little context. First extension official, likely.
Second state emergency declared january extended.
Third recent law (2018) allows maximum 12 months state emergency possibility 12 months extension (under specific conditions).

Now about? state emergency personal freedoms limited (lockdowns), government also publish special decrees quickly without parliament vote.

So obviously becomes political issue. opposition complaining months parliament made useless. government claims necessary provide prompt strong answer virus spread.

Technically also reasons. italian law smart working implemented personal agreement employer employee lot beurocracy. state emergency rule overridden special law allowing company quickly implement smart working every employee. situation none wants go back normal work companies realize soon get covid case shut 2 weeks also forced smart work changed mentality employers. sweet US made every country wait make everything fucking political.

But well initially, look cases/deaths per capita. see issue acknowledging trade locking down, especially compare immediate neighbours.

The issue people falsely pushing 'herd immunity strategy' one employed Sweden. main goal always flatten curve, they've done via recommending people work home enforcing social distancing. also instituted extended lockdown elderly living care homes, something many people gloss over. Pandemic no, spit table? GTFO Damn wonder car accident deaths might go global lockdown never overstated. never reported correctly. underestimated since start made worse.

Read article again. 

This FDA removing two Trump appointed spokesmen, replaced Rebello Felderbaum, whom, nearly month, still hold position. 

I don’t see article shows Trump taking FDA’s communications. anything, shows FDA resisting preventing Trump administration so. 

The thing could construed Trump two anonymous sources, talking administration’s general strategy, without specific connection this: “The White House, however, considering appointing political replacements roles, said two people knowledge administration’s personnel strategy”. Looks like it! least wind tunnel think. yeah, pretty obviously wrong things freaked people early days.  know real numbers end week. Like always. ""I get risk life stay housed fed, yippee!""

Shit covered papers? You’re supposed flush nasty shit lol Pretty much regular surgical masks do. there’s sorts cloth masks right since regular disposable ones weren’t available first. nice cloth ones still wire. I’d say NZs response lockdowns science, transparent information, clear communication. That's potentially difference getting.

Show Goldens fluffy, bit bulkier usually light gold, field goldens really skinny short hair, dark hair. field golden fast phenomenal hunter, show Goldens, tried hunt, suck it. wearing mask right guy's face yelling spitting breathing him

Now tell single case coronavirus protest true. Spain, get fined correctly wearing mask. elders, passed on, survived one cow. keep wondering how/why people behave absurdly yeah I’m always casually forgetting people much privileged. I’m privileged again, living memory passed kid. I’ve got adoptive family versus bio family adoptive family might making hair fall out. don’t get it, still hoard food. People need wake call this. human history, everyone would paranoid me. People think fear dangerous/unhealthy it’s species survived. They’ve found many ways numb it’s sad. don’t want people die can’t understand reality. That’s sad. Infuriating also sad. No...fucking...shit!

If you’re reading epiphany, problem. specified title :) that's pointed £ symbol, see UK article. Walmart across street 0 enforcement far tell. Plenty employees noses there, too. don’t really go anywhere else though, virus. still see people wearing face shield saying good. Heck even NFL seems cool saw coach wearing one sidelines hear getting fined. would like answer well. one would even test meet three criteria state never updated: doctor's note test fever, cough, sore throat. 

The doctor told absolutely based upon symptoms (most recognized, nearly 10 months pandemic) poor oxygen saturation. I'm considered ""presumptive positive"" case. news, sky blue masks gay always rough, even pre-pandemic. typical Queens. think elegant. see homes here. I'm transplant quite culture shock. could convince people bedazzled jewel encrusted gold lame masks height fashion would convince others wealthy, would comply mask mandates every social situation. Haha guess partly yeah far left SJW cult.

""Intersectionality"" backbone SJW cultist ""victim"" point hierarchy. Nope. Guess playground wrong choice. casino couple years ago, washing hands bathroom saw constant stream morons leaving stalls taking dump leave without washing hands. idiots playing machines touching cards. Never again. aware thing untrustworthy. can't claimed meaningful result. absolutely correct. I'm sure feel way anyone disagree with. ""You're part problem"" Yeah sure thought better safe sorry know effective given vaccine least phase III trials complete. kinds problems Brazil study, including inconsistent delineation boundaries seropositivity studies new case reports (they're apples oranges). also issue one herd immunity threshold. radically different different places depending heterogeneity susceptibility population virus. finally, depending characteristics population question (especially much exposure daily basis) overshoot much 50% threshold. We've seen cruise ship prison examples.

In short, know anything yet. First all, want thank taking time, writing expressing yourself. message really ""feel"" hard time you. I'm gonna honest feel offended way, please be, I'm guy side world communicating you, something rather amazing called internet.

Yes lot complicated, believe everyone same, everyone mindset.

The ""plenty people healthy dropped dead"" really agree with. numbers CDC infection fatality ratio:

0-19 years: 0.00003
20-49 years: 0.0002
50-69 years: 0.005
70+ years: 0.054

I've travelled world many places, places dangerous diseases, dangerous animals, dangerous humans.
It stop living did, well nobody gonna avoid dead anyway.
But that's mindset, realising going die, weird enough something nobody really thinks about, that's never really seem live. Sorry I'm getting bit philosophical here.

Mental health physical health go hand hand. know, say active, feel great gym session hard hike nature. even feeling good exercising motivates me, feeling bad it!

You're stuck house, routine's, sounds like excuses me. really want to, make way. Get jumping rope, resistance bands, body weight exercises, fine, really want to.

You say right moment everything going on. say perfect moment, personally scared covid complications going world right now. are, great get best shape possible, build strong defence, best possible outcome get infected?

Edit: finish message, hope choose live life, let fear overtake you, life goes fast end filled regrets things do. worry, happy. mom says like conspiracy affect results. ""Watch, it'll become less big deal election."" agree you. would better players got staff honest. realise cancer patients immunocompromised right? There's real risk come hospitals treatment there's vaccine COVID-19. also looks really dumb  point vaccines guess then, since goal vaccinating much population possible. Trump hates supporters lol.

lol everyone die covid HEY LEAST TAXES Im conflicted. Ive working everyday, go grocery store, restarunts freinds house recently. keep hearing awful pandemic see zero evidence. yet see hospital overcrowded. Meanwhile, hear great peaceful protests hundreds thousands people, see much evidence showing violence destruction. nobody around dying? live state almost zero restrictions one wears masks. dont underatand know amything anymore Translation: Americans love families, care communities, love country, willing rise make sacrifices protect hold dear.

The rest selfish unpatriotic put first. Yes, pissing directly onto hands way get covered germs.

Found guy shakes everyone's hand office ""totally clean"" dick hands. Ok good luck that. Judges already ordered many orders violate freedom assembly doubt even get probation. shit people care. That’s... objectively true, “fuck you” unnecessary exactly fatigue winter. social contact sensible thing young people.

I fear blow though. MISTER POPO, MAGGOT mean, sounds efficient me. 

/s, case it’s apparent. 6 months, cases exponential (for example double every 7 days), would know it. USA capacity massive testing.

I'm saying today's numbers ok anything. Great response lol wonder sports team managers too. Lack funds obviously cause. Someone informed gaiters incorrectly worn masks sets bad example fans. faces blotted TV see this. Sweden achieved significant level immunity lower death rate America. death's flatlined 2+ months.
   
Really, there's hardly better way say it. wake up. wasting life invested propaganda.
   regards thread. pure speculation OP supporters fabricating questions offering evidence study untrustworthy. I've done intense cardio, running, boxing, wearing mask. think “anecdote” comes leading pulmonology center major city, it’s worth weight. Finally, someone asking stupid questions. Ouch! hurts even think about!!!!!!  certainly endemic people’s stupidity, think it’s bit that. selfish, willfully ignorant people want preserve old freedoms also giving moral license. tell “I’m wearing mask,” justify reckless, selfish, ignorant behavior. Trying find something better sites ridiculous warning labels. could swear seen well. Apparently it’s actually “do try stop hands genitals.” Look governor lol. rest world myth created democrats. r/nottheonion sucks! swear these: affiliation folks - like masks). fit well nose customizable nose wires, adjustable ear straps, filter lot cloth map (according website least) praise Dale brotherrrrr Shaving cream help me. one ""no shit"" things get places “require masks” actually commit helping anyone. understand vaccines available directly they're created right? going ignore fact girl severely overweight? tragedy, get wrong let's pretend obese people perfectly healthy. believe states require electoral vote match winning vote state. Others not. Fucktards... Calm popo lot experts think will. much less talk Sweden late. reason, would seem, Sweden’s strategy appears tamed virus. countries around world experiencing resurgence COVID-19 outbreaks, Sweden’s COVID-19 deaths slowed result, many nations catching Sweden per capita deaths, passing it. Italy recently popped back ahead Sweden. Chile passed Swedes next. came Brazil, surpassed Sweden per capita deaths Wednesday.
  
Stop buying fear. government friend. Mainstream reddit authority reality. 
  
I hope see propaganda one day.  people can't tell I'm mouth breather, affect me. Consider Pikachu surprised! People get mad want here... I’m work. gets hot honestly hate face hot sometimes heat makes harder breath (I severe asthma) help that, pull mask little bit. **BUT!** pull back nose whenever customers within even 10 feet me. confirmed cases largely limited testing capacity strategy time. Depends whether crowded bus/restaurant, whether participants wear masks. MLB fine expert news, water wet. shit... Trustworthy news source? People die, everyone dies infected counted COVID deaths places.

Its logic, stated verified facts 5% suffer permanent damage

There absolutely evidences yet, pure speculation, pneumonia alone common happens millions people every year might leave lung bad enough someone cannot work 6 months even fully recover end.

40 million people US alone cant work signed unemployment due lockdowns, hell talking about? 60% businesses forced close never open again. 250 million worldwide falling misery risking starvation due lockdowns.

Lockdowns funneling money towards automated online services tearing smaller businesses, literally machine giving billionaires money making majority population poorer.

Profits else man. silly. yet still someone every unemployment post telling us Walmart hiring. wife’s coworker tested positive June, fever recovered that, still work result fatigue not. Scary stuff sure, especially relatively healthy, motivated/driven work. three months unexpected. said, friend friend recovered feels fine now, knows anything long term. seems like dice roll uncertainty really equivalent? No. right bat article nothing educate anti maskers furthers circle jerk become get good public shaming video unmasked Karen. Productive.

Either way, I'd still get vaccine hopefully things go better time! care think, one going trust professional research basic knowledge. attitude common scares me. really hope future. 
 
I think taking said little extreme 
 
In line work, knowing quickly access correct information apply properly extremely useful skill waste time.

I hope governor ignores them. serious? don’t think even engage you. You’re honestly trying claim COVID everything related hasn’t politicized USA? denial. mask wearing “it’s overblown democratic hoax” everything between...

I mean honestly even saying? Lol Florida Hospital worker here, large wave horizon. know blaming population. People pretty obedient first. March thru May world locked lot rebellion. think seen end economic damage caused rescue plans. Trillions debt effects generations. Yes that’s life. People die everyday. point wash hands stay home sick like told us get go.
