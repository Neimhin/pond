Hopefully help understand you’re wrong. stay home orders supposed prevent hospitals overwhelmed, did. they’re simply destroying entire industries little benefit. Countries like Sweden never locked down. Instead, used controlled avalanche approach vulnerable sheltered healthy members society go business contracting recovering disease. logic every one die don’t reopen gyms allow indoor dining, car analogy doesn’t directly apply. hope helped understand you’re wrong. :) multiple studies going on. Someone puts proposal study NIH might fund it.

This one probably asked 7 participating countries willing join study. always good get data different population. Maybe risk different different groups need figure participating countries India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kenya, Zambia, Democratic Republic Congo Guatemala, said. study conducted Global Network Women’s Children’s Health Research, group clinical sites funded NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute Child Health Human Development (NICHD). charge poor schmuck $10k test state probably gave hospital fuck people jobs save lives. way! knew since begi... oh did.

Shift left helps politicians cover asses citizens disagree government, fingers always pointed someone lower food chain

Corruption happens people get distracted political divides. Trump gave son law ability direct PPE procurement friends, political discussion? Americans centered around national stockpile PPE. classic tale happens us citizens again:
1. Identify problem, get public's attention.
2. ""Solve"" way benefits friends yourself. 
3. Keep smile screw country over.

Sometimes (like PPE) obvious others.  people literally getting sick dying corona. want get others around sick, make ""whiner imprisoning myself"" literally it’s good idea get flu shot every year flu amirite? /s  weeks longer detected saliva swabs, prove virus hiding nerves spinal fluid lymph fluid.  think means anything discomfort intense first wake morning? makes think could gastro issue. cousin acid reflux know sleeps elevated. might try see changes anything. suppose could also give TUMS try. What's issue here? I'm seeing rioters setting fire buses, cracked down. Lol appearently comment controvertial. OP _THRIVING_ extremely harsh enviromment people jelly af.

Quarantine ain't got shit boy issue me. secret? I'm always depressed. Western Australia, state 2.6m km^2 population ~2.6m people, we've 650 cases Covid-19 total, 9 deaths.

It bizarre seeing rest world, even states Australia suffer this, returned life usual. 

We crowds 30,000 football games transmission, free travel within home state, movie theaters, bars, pubs, casinos, trains packed people maybe 1 1000 people wearing mask necessary.  

It makes immensely proud sandgroper. miss “before pandemic” level depression too. mornings wake literally scream I’m miserable don’t want awake/alive. Used could somewhat fight mental health problems sort marginalizing reminding problem mostly head, now? problems definitely aren’t head, there’s end sight, fact there’s threat may even become worse? I’m exhausted healthy coping mechanisms. takes extreme amounts effort make basic stuff like clean house shower eat food, there’s chance hell I’m going yoga draw picture.

I want hug everyone magically fix everything. taper slowly. let doc bully anything else. mention case response better. notification processes place attempts contact trace. ""Hero""? problem, even forced. ""Privilege"" forced it? can't really know forced. Would give kid employer threatened something? To, see, know, kid proper hero. know corners cut development. I'm sure read somewhere anyone taking Vitamin tablets gradually build levels, point taking large doses, body flushes out. Build weeks etc it'd much better you. Dude would've volunteered work free help out, patriotic citizen would same. unbelievable national effort like literally possible resources funds geared towards saving pandemic. sounds like medication gets advertised Jeopardy. American society deeply fucked up. Good things elsewhere world make less fucked up. No, see caught COVID exposed infected it. vitamin levels likely little it.

I'm glad cam OK. anything wrong taking multivitamin? makes feel better I'm kiwi spent last 3 months Seoul, living Melbourne January year, back NZ every one places sick virus Americans are. dipshits 3 countries govt fucking around US (I spent part April Atlanta) people can't decide tomatoe toomato Schools much NY usually open Labor Day. That's normal since kid upstate. opening September 9 would later usual start, expected. late calendar would start (just Labor Day late year).

Then, I've heard, delayed two days spotty outbreaks. one news talking anxiety depression pandemic. Ive also seen ""touch starvation"" mentioned. Welcome world. Ive starved intimate touch 5 years atleast. Also dealing lonliness since virus came about. statistics blame solely south eastern portion United States. drug use,

really? Well infected cases going countries Denmark passed Sweden. Check /r/antiwork take 5000 IU Vitamin D3 day along Magnesium, Vitamin K, C, B6, E Zinc Ensure (Also FWIW Pepcid, Baby Asperin. recent blood levels 43. Two years ago 32. I’m sure read comment? I’ve taking year already, got COVID way back April I’ve already recovered. point Vitamin actually helpful COVID, got sick it, it’s *possibly* indication Vitamin dose low. ways knowing insurance won’t cover Vitamin test. Wow last phrase would make great song lyric. Yes, tiny percentage do. Keep fear mongering. Well, we're talking functioning countries. We're talking U.S. Let's stay topic. Also, N95 shortage ton due supply demand. One exceeding point. hospitals buy without sort government assistance money issue comes PPE. mostly really hard get things. beginning places. Even states. ^(The patients scheduled return evaluation six, 12 24 weeks discharge hospital. visits, clinical examinations, laboratory tests, analysis amounts oxygen carbon dioxide arterial blood, lung function tests, computed tomography (CT scans echocardiograms carried out.))

So seems like ""participant"" ""hospitalized patient"" ""person confirmed diagnosis."" (""Patient"" generally means person treated hospital, always used rigorously). definitely reporting serious cases, say might hidden symptoms less serious cases. stop evictions forever. 

We can. Fuck landlords. Namibia, South Africa... etc. can't throw rational arguments people, always deflection. vitamin though. almost definitely need multivitamin. fighting UBI housing human right? [The source 2020 going year, finishing Year 12, meeting long distance relationship. relationship utterly destroyed. going meet August 2020. two years may wait another year meet her. vaccine ready October November emergency ones administered health care workers, regular people. Vitamin going actually stop getting COVID. COVID, take Vitamin D. silly. problem certain political wing making political issue, US. I'm seeing countries holding demonstrations virus (how hell hold demonstration virus? dumb?) always come kind political parties.

It's always kind people, follow blindly leader even means death, always kind leader following.

No, sadly, American individualism, human stupidity decency. Two things inversely proportional among certain kind voter. individualism people talking points, information sources idolize leaders. Hm yes wonder I'm boat miss appointments used go low depression end last year. getting help, covid forced everything shut down. least got meds help keep sane part :( masks allowed nonstop excuses move date. 


""I want (family/friends/future kids/myself) look back wedding photos reminded coronavirus times""


""We're *ready* get married""


""We waiting move get married""


They many excuses. supposed bridesmaid, respectfully declined months ago. fiance best man feels obligated go. 


I'm orthodontics (for free) bride. Aside pandemic, another months would allow much better esthetic result. 


They said morning half people invited coming (so ~75 150). indoor reception/outdoor barn style wedding Wisconsin. told since area private property follow COVID local ordinances 🙄


There seems million reasons it, it. 


I get deposits may hard lose, would think losing friends/family/unknown associates would exponentially harder. effect big enough, need large sample size.

In experiment, 50 VitD patients 26 control patients. controls, half ended ICU, 1 50 VitD patients go ICU.

The chances outcome happening pure chance astronomically small. hospitals rationing n95s right now?

Hospitals countries functioning governments actively opposed keeping country alive. actually design dunc surf merch wear show lol  Sounds really promising. could people going abroad theoretically take beforehand minimise risk catching transmitting another country? hand picked every flu pandemic? smallpox cholera typhoid measles smallpox happen? easy take risks stolen money.  There's definitely way less way ""children essentially immune"" compare US countries. 

Fact one knows act like do. Hopefully vaccine 6 12 months. Thank God children - feel parents weight variables decide person schooling vs mitigating infection risk much possible. kids, know I'd latter.... Get SAD light. test positivity rate 1%, infection rate (in population whole?)

Assuming 14-day infection period, 1% infection rate would 194,500 cases per two-week period, 13,892 per day, suggesting NY would capturing 5% cases.

On hand, 1% positive, 750-odd cases per day, still means 75,000 tests per day, 1 test per person every 8.5 months. messaging 28 days [**2020-10-05 08:18:35 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-10-05%2008:18:35%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

First: No, it’s even close.

Second: don’t want flu, either. shit sucks. read bit Chinese history going it? 
 
Read 3 chapters far hard time understanding really happened IRL alternate time-line book (Cultural Revolution references). throw Trump signs call boat flotilla Trump covered political gathering. That's life foreseeable future. become ""normal"" eventually, whether like not. Still opens lot possibilities, e.g., combining negative PCR test reduce transmission flying, etc. wonder whether could still usefully given weekly high-risk communities, hospitals, etc. 20 million dead Americans would absolutely fuck country like WWII Europe. responsible burying loved ones one would answer phone Emergency Services. Everything would stop cold. would reason live life normally local transmission 0 rather ""low"".

Well, German government stated months ago rescind restrictions allow return normal even zero active cases, apparently never sure caught all.  Bro, try schedule time slot buddies call chill, maybe play party games like Fall Guys Jack box Party. 
 
It's going drinks everyone's home mean can't socialize bit! weird see got anti depression pills covid started ""Natural selection"" capitalism means ""kill poor"" Honestly, Senegal pretty good trajectory. saying they'll become ""Wakanda."" seems like pretty good place work live. One thing, Coronavirus subreddit.

Another, lot worse flu. infectious ""flu"" 100 years. also really nice have, even survive.

Don't downplay something could cost millions lives prevented. Learn history stop fucking stupid. thinking safety. first vaccine might 50% effective. Would safe get different type vaccine well increase chance gaining immunity? taxes too. Bizarre. need guinea pigs locations pandemic control healthcare system pretty ineffective, easily get thousands volunteers. Feeding doom addicts easy karma.. looking like short term prophylaxis treatment. Ivermectin 18 hour half life blood plasma.

So protocol persistent prophylaxis - example health care professional constantly exposed - take weekly dose. least frequency mentioned - example medcram (youtube) Dr Seheult hospital taking.

For illustrative purposes, take monthly wont help middle month due 18 hour half-life.

This specific study talking infection event family - one-time would sufficient probably.

For small team Antarctica, would probably choose one administration ensure recurrence reinfection cycles. Perhaps weekly dose 2-3 weeks. might need 10 000IU less 1000iu, everyone get blood levels tested. 

Ha, tried live Pacific Northwest... PCP like “yeah insurance won’t cover that, assume everyone vitamin deficient recommend take supplement”. taking 5000IU daily probably year now, still wound pretty severe COVID symptoms. much worse think would’ve needed hospital. Wonder need higher vitamin dose.  Isn’t point fear peddling sub? I'm using English data England constitutes 85% UK population data nations comparable dashboard tell you. seriously think Wales less 1/10th population England admissions England?

English hospital admissions 24% past week information using 7 day average pooling 300-400 incidences means say confidence statistically significant. USA horrible terrifying mess long pandemic. hospital get like millions for.eqch covid death real not? /S assume something probably linked Medicare card/immunisation registrar moved state! Maine!

NY Covid-19 went moved Maine.

Maine went 45%. 

1 wedding Millinocket. news.  

Research responsible. Stay Maine.. makes sense specified ""PCR"" \[polymerase chain reaction\]( application test kits: PCR test, required primers need exactly overlapping pathogen DNA sequence (or case coronavirus cDNA) test supposed detect. PCR test covid-19 must include primers targeting SARS-nCoV-2 virus nothing else (which would produce false-positive test results). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tinfoil hat seems rather impossible item catalogue number (902780) redundantly applied generic product class - PCR test unique specific pathogen sequence. remember start outbreak, hundreds videos floating around internet doctors *were* talking seeing ground. none now?

China's really opaque think is. hundreds thousands foreigners country, plus fact VPNs allow anyone country two braincells cross firewall anything leak. 

The fact there's absolutely **no** solid evidence China's significantly manipulating statistics *6 months* plateau pretty good sign they're least close telling truth, opinion. argument seems based England increasing UK not? current localised outbreaks England. couple weeks ago, Merthyr Tydfil one main hotspots, Wales would shown increasingly exponentially. small numbers, week week comparison relevant longer term (month month) trends.

There's sore thumb stick general trends either hospitalizations deaths ONS/NHS data. l said, thought may due cases moving smaller demographic, cases increasing hospitalizations deaths not. No, believe cases either. always funny people throw arguments, there's nothing fall back person share thought. Vietnam, like China, one lowest press freedom rankings world.

To believe country 1.4 billion people 0 local transmission naive, verging lunacy. like Iran, reports true number cases Vietnam China future.

And try go strawman argument either: 
a. bringing u.s reason
b. stating life like right China
I address those.
Firstly, care situation U.S. 
Secondly, I'm arguing idea literally cases, pandemic largely contained. would bet millions, take loans even, situation Hong Kong happening across cities China. end world, certainly greater 0. 

Finally, say, 'even that's case, what?'. clearly matters. international prestige. benefit, domestically, internationally, state numbers China stating. soft power works. think Russia hosted Olympics Putin likes sports? pandemic would go downtown school loved it. Away everything, able choose large variety foods, walking around bustling big city. Gave sense freedom independence. covid that’s gone, I’m mostly balled room parents house nothing playing games free time. It’s mindnumbingly boring, taking toll mental health. Didn’t help arguments happen often room right beside paranoid grandmother listens everyone’s conversations. can’t ever vent. thing keeping sanity ADHD making super easy forget happenings daily. need move out. turn statement around also. government care point people caring. ops cold war

It's fascist propaganda, dude. different people argue different levels ideal .

Rhonda Patrick Phd argues 40-60 masterjohn Phd argues fopr experts seem think 40ng/ml good, low risk adverse effects. Higher levels provide benefit according people also seem associated higher risk. Besides able go movies concerts girlfriend (something lot), able see family members (including grandfather going cancer), feeling like crazy person many people wear masks/take serious (Midwest represent), current state politics racism country, everything going okay. Same. RIP BJJ. Earned another stripe blue belt shutdown March. Gained 40lbs since don’t think I’ll ever going back. Yes seeing, much less news.  ppl still go partying doesnt care virus xD No, it’s grinding incompetence months. Open bars, close parks beaches. Masks don’t work, masks save us. Help at-risk? No, close hair salons.  There's ""flaw"". point flu virus stimulate immune response. symptoms get infliuenza due mostly body's response fighting virus. vaccination produce similar reactions due kicking immune system, severity much less.

When get flu shot feel like kinda ass 24 hours tired achey like I've got 99F fever. annoying ""feels like might coming something"" kind feeling. kind thing power easier day. 24-48 hours later feel fine.

When lazy getting flu shots got influenza couple years ago ran 103F fever 3 days straight, seriously considered checking ER, wiped 3-4 weeks felt fully recovered. Actual influenza kicks ass way vaccination malaise.

The reactions eventual COVID vaccine may fairly severe vaccination standards people may wind feeling ill ~24-48 hours (we'll see ones actually get approved, seem knock bit). thing wind dying ventilator COVID vaccine.

This normal though. vaccination kicks immune response. immune response feel good (varies though different people). passes replicating virus body (and really ill) get antibodies.  get actually sick future. Thank you. infection rate still climb (like much NY last month), even percent positive remains mostly stable. false. ask students within group stay home precaution, community transmission within school. cases family member got student tested positive.

However going expected. reopened school last spring masks mandatory almost cases schools. measures get cases. one tiny crack country's (Australia) defensive line (literally one hotel one state) led weeks single even digit cases entire nation skyrocketing month death total 102 first wave, deaths skyrocketed closing 700 second wave finally wrestled control extraordinary effort we're completely yet.

It take much things reverse course hit even harder first time round point I'm trying make here. first-principles understanding though? UVB creates vitamin D, UVB causes cancer. go crazy. Magnesium easy take much of. real consequences do. felt way pandemic. work related. doctor put beta blocker. treated chest pain caused high blood pressure caused depression anxiety. Maybe go doctor ask would right you. dead. lack clarity. Nazi Germany wasn’t even clear normal population gas people. It’s basically issue. rogue state breaking international human rights trying cover propaganda suppression population. 

Talking USA? Americans force-fed propaganda day every day believe sending troops way Middle East ""defending America"", parking military ships next China somehow ""protecting America"". Probably, ask doctor stuff, since people different conditions experiences. Yes, exactly! US, also EU, Canda, etc

""Poor"",""3rd world"" countries outperforming dozens self-content super rich... I'm using government dashboard centre averages.

Centred averages take account 3 days date 3 days better representation data said day simply using preceding 7 days like done.

This explains discrepancy completely valid methods. important thing I'm using latest available data correctly identify copies average 26th 2nd. doctor said ""normal"" people without deficiency. People seem dislike reality. assure New Yorkers following mask rules. view post history visiting local Walmart bike. Needless say would say good 90% people area wearing masks.

We like fuck around State want economy running know, like support families ignorant asses part. also governor fuck around either.

There's popular bar/restaurant old hometown owned family orange shit gibbon supporters. Someone took pics packed bar one wearing mask - sure pics landed social media, yeah State Liquor Authority found out. Needless say liquor license suspended going shit luck getting back.

Now business going business likelihood. around almost 40 years life. royally fucked otherwise successful business. say damage? WTF? transparent US government. Remember back March senators said virus big deal bunch insider trading pharma companies? Go xinjiang look smiling happy people definitely aren’t forced work shave heads sterilized, everyone choice Also, go outside get sun. Ah son planning getting married fiance yet meet person. fine eloping (in fact hope do.) Last thing want right fly across country wedding, even kid. constant yellow peril propaganda got overused boring effective Russian vaccine also currently starting phase 3 trials... Freshers week gonna chaotic, least 2 weeks are.

Lots pent ""I much ages"", combined usual drinking sessions small student bars/clubs, combined general lower level hygiene comes living away first time, combined frugality students meaning might bother buying masks, combined drop temperatures?

Absolute carnage come. I’d go two I’s: Ignorance longstanding, deeply-ingrained anti-intellectualism US.

If we’d put 5% money spent weapons-development improving public schools particular science health programs, would better (and much doubt we’d missed 5% spent weapons-dev). wish people would drink alcohol instead feeling depressed. can't feel anything drunk. I've flu probably 10x life. Usually feel like crap like 3-4 days I'm fine. ...and mortality rate 2020? track average previous years it’s people lived seen shit eyes. limit much baby formula bring in? Couldn’t oversight goes food, could it? Chinese bot, stand awe super-advanced A.I. Sunblock long enough burn, lot cosmetics (foundations, etc) come sunblock them. Gonna jealous long time til US straighten fuck . Karma us China go back normal parties would explain Africa low numbers. Probably exposure sunlight places. Add Hawai’i list Well sorry accusing average wrong, least doesn’t match dates. example, 30th average increases almost 4, however actual admissions less 30th 23rd (44 23rd 38 30th). 

I used data copied excel got figures said before. average appears based 26th 2nd rather 23rd 30th said previously prevent getting infected, prevent severe disease. people money influence politicians rich people, might stock market important government. afaik China willing give Indonesia formula make themselves. Projected output like 2 million day something.

Philippines well. FYI, us live live. coming winter here. noticed always seemed feel happy topped Snoqualmie started eastern side. really put together got blood test back said vitamin 11. Ready CCP bots downvote me. believe China. confirm. Red, Red, Red, Blue, Blue, Red, Red, Toss up, Toss up, Red, Red, Red, Red, Red, Red, Red, Red, Toss up. I’m NYC.

Everywhere reduced capacity degree. 

And masks. I’m every day work normal errands/life. many people wearing masks without question. arguments, exclude US vaccine safety issue. saying'. probably already seeing someone keep get someone talk to. got this. too. I'm Zoloft extremely anxious. I'm depressed I'm willing start exercising. works I've done before. Please know alone. whole world fucked man lmao doctor referred “The Perfect Storm”. chronic depression, crippling anxiety, ADD/ADHD. together manifested OCD miserable way. obsessed news, case numbers, careful COVID past 6+ months. get instantly enraged people refusing comply safety measures make hyper focus makes depressed. I’ve several meltdowns this, felt extremely suicidal, plain defeated. haven’t able productively clean house hyper focus task point overthinking it, eventually abandoning it.  health insurance starts month I’m getting back therapy ASAP. ""You contain deny.""

How? containing without tracing, tracing goes effect people know it. thought I'd made clear. 

Sigh, keep banging statistics. Statistically China cases America right? Guess what, don't. comparing 2 countries saying statistically impossible idiotic. must take account actions taken countries new Zealand's actions, whilst good, even come close China done.

""far important democracy.

this sad, frankly.""

This means understand China. think could switch democracy tomorrow know talking about. say wish them, said wish free press more. attainable frankly important. Chinese people decide form government want, I. think we've seen happens America goes around installing democracies countries pretty. Let's leave Chinese people decide.

""You live one party state restrictions continued get worse technology control increased""

That's simply true, technology may used control can, generally average Chinese person far aware ever before. Guess why, technology.

You think hundreds cases day reported. wrong. simple that. know talking about, yet still talking, that's sad part. experience, aren’t many people better masking New Yorkers non-pregnant people vaccinated, chance pregnant person catching virus minimal.

That's call ""Herd Immunity"". vaccinated keep unvaccinated secure numbers.

Problems arise artificially inflate number unvaccinated allowing antivaxxers avoid vaccine. USA last, meaning USA first. Hey guys welcome party. rough. Get help support asap. wait. rise Rome - via conquering.

The rise Mongols - via conquering.

The rise modern China - default... ish... Beyond Scared Straight: Pandemic corona virus propensity mutation begin with; original virus mutated slightly communicable version back started. it’s mutating even frequently, increases probability one new strains dangerous, perhaps even lethal rather communicable.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's pretty cool. ""no fights masks"" pretty low bar clear. saying. that's genes work Cases mean shit. detect bit RNA, people positive might already disease instead infectious sick. 80.000 deaths India. 6,5 million people die every year India. deaths even *five days excess deaths*. life years lost even less mostly people die years live.

COVID-19 disease rich. poor really suffering halted economy. Joe nobody talking Rogan ... sigh. 'they' buy entire shops supply Vit next 2 weeks. Till get bored forget. 

As daily vit taker study makes happy tho. 😊 decade virus hit (and scientists discovered Covid-19 could get body eyes), Russians started trend called ""Vodka Eyeballing"" (yes, real thing - look up).

They would simply pour Vodka shot glass, cup open end eyeball. effect Vodka absorbed bloodstream quicker mucous membranes.

(It harmful eyes though, especially cornea, recommend it.) Believe positive quarantine. False negatives large known issue, even infectious 20% chance false negative, past day chances grow. really collectivism vs individualism. seeing pandemic scientific pov vs political pov. meant isnt common sense virus fuck up.

I know anyone regarded flu minor inconvenience covid; colds yes, flu. 

Personally wish people took flu seriously that's fucked system lifelong chronic illness result spectacularly screwed over. think something daft like 1 100,000 chance flu virus, thats really much comfort me. could genetic predisposition, run immune system, high viral load shitty luck, number still up.

With covid, even 1 10k chance developing lifelong conditions, reasonable society pause economy can't take many dropping workforce. That's sexy headline ""but DEATH!!!!"", admit, remains seen covid results significant number royally fucked immune systems, would relieved people erred side caution. 

Anyway think ultimately agree viruses fuck us up, middle ground Chicken Little pretending happening  I’m brown skin woman live coastal area. always beach. didn’t think worry vitamin that. shocked told low taking high amount supplements. purchased vitamin B6, B100, C, D, E, Iron, Magnesium another can’t remember right now. got first week March.... got sick Covid barely second week. I’m taking daily feel like it’s really helped still deal Covid related things. round steroids + antibiotics 3 weeks ago seemed REALLY improve things...

Bottom line won’t stop taking vitamins I’m going continue eat anti-inflammatory possible. 

Stay safe! record, fine $16.90 could buy 10 meals. also skeptical considering six months pandemic still can’t work PPE situation. Wait, what? got immediately sidetracked ***Zigazag Univ**, spotted ***ZagaZig Univ*** another paragraph gotta go Google It’s tiny percentage. way argue huge percentage follow CT’s. huge percentage have, seen lasting damage accuse misrepresenting data I'm please. 30-23 7 days.

ER last night, saw chest ct (I’m also physician). It’s pretty terrible looking. doctor thought current Covid infection (I months ago), certainly look like that, Covid test negative (just one last week also) damage likely lasting. seeing past Covid patients. It’s hard say long damage really last. Hopefully permanent tell you, miss breathing. (My Covid infection serious either. Never hospitalized). I’m terrified know children’s lungs look like, worse did. And? There's plenty more. Like hundred thousand more.  Ill put way. cant trust China Russia health life cant trust US either, especially handled health pandemic.

Would like guess long hits U.S.? don’t want see anyone else ICU. go /r/collapse Yes correct. matter malicious, still encourage others malicious hurt someone feelings (your actions words affect around even think harmless joke would think grown adults would've learned now). 

Plus teacher making jokes like students know affect them. Also stop strawmanning acting like people less tolerant insensitive ""harmful"" jokes means ""omg guys want censored government! "". Ridiculous comparison, like said dumb HS kid mentaitly adults learn considerate open thier mouths. Yes lost job 1 sentence, action words consequences. went March: scared straight. need vaccine get rid this, keeping things closed long time solution. point need accept certain death rate. makes sense honest. Feeling depressed unemployed, staying indoors, seeing much sad news lately. hits drags hard. Lots lots people deficient.

Bad influence article specifically referenced going parties July 4 weekend. I’m sure parameters New York (gatherings 10?), DEFINITELY CDC recommendations, likely source. 

Not wish ill. sounds like laying bed made. doc prescribed amount means blood tests showed deficient are. seriously lacking vitamin bad Lyme infection prescribed 5,000 IU/day 6 weeks tested again. juuuuust hit threshold take anymore doc suggested continue reduced dosage schedule maintain. couldn’t move couch almost year ended supplement finding legs again. still take chewable every day get blood tests couple times year. doubts dosage, ask blood test. It’s good know stand address deficiencies. parents alive visit knowingly took activities increased risk. idiot, merely pleading people able accept risks. 

If someone goes party pretty much self isolates after, tell burden society. read post Reddit makes question doctor's recommendation?  think consult Facebook second opinion. currently 19 million recovered Covid cases USA.

How many think lifetime conditions? take 5,000 IU barely put acceptable range year. takes quite become toxic. Go get simple blood test year. start nearing upper limit, cut recommended daily intake. year levels significantly lower, try happy medium. 

The time I’ve ever check periodically (like every 3 months) super dosed 50,000 IU twice week. Even then, didn’t get close toxic. 

I’d worry far deficient toxic. feel worried, cut 1000-4000.  child much younger. dont think anything went wrong.  always selfish like this.  Brides family, knowledge, dont believe pandemic anything worry about. go party eat like one get sick. son tends assimilate whatever lifestyle gf has.

Honestly that’s silver lining 2020 me. I’m getting control, I’m sober again, I’m living best life. listen Joe Rogan old news ODing vitiman extremely difficult would take considerable effort purpose.

Cheers think countries going get vaccine country pumped billions development? Lol sure take normal amount vit D.

If middle ground 60,000 600 IU/day! fine long taking 10,000 iu. would checked often. taking 5,000 months. actual recommended dose insanely low tbh went hamptons July 4th, got covid September. conclusions supposed draw ""backlash""?

I don’t understand what’s doom gloom sub. article address concerns.

 It’s ok either know that, push political agenda elsewhere. He's likely already it. anything good photo op. lol sure guy implement bubble structure like NBA (admittedly much larger scale), it’s doable. money stake, could make happen. absorb that, high amount counterbalance absorption.

You'd almost think group people trying drag shit long possible. Lol people getting tired ""can't wait things get back normal"". isnt going away, welcome new normal. Places handle get back normal, extraordinarily unlikely United States ever get point. I’m sure expert That's science, that's woo. Yikes.. saying try communism virus proven many weaknesses systems? 
If that's saying... compare systems communism? Came say this. 50% Americans (trumpsters) think hoax. thing 50% vote November. think made right choice. Community college cheaper per credit, one. Transfer credit, virus better control still college experience. obviously don’t know works you’re making statements like PCR tests, antibody tests. kind test it? Antibodies tested? total 56 patients (65%) showed persistent symptoms time six-week visit; breathlessness (dyspnoea) common symptom (40 patients, 47%), followed coughing (13 patients, 15%). 12-week visit, breathlessness improved present 31 patients (39%); however, 13 patients (15%) still coughing

Yup roughly experienced well. Took almost three months lungs recover. buy random brand online I'm fit tested to, much help. Definitely agree.

## Summary

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents one greatest infectious challenges humanity recent history. One striking features infection heterogeneous clinical response worse outcomes observed older patients underlying health conditions. date potential impact previous infection history poorly investigated potential determinant risk. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), persistent herpesvirus infection whose prevalence increases age, major modulator immune function several observations suggest infection might act influence clinical outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection. particular, CMV associated acceleration immune senescence linked range cardiovascular metabolic disorders. review addresses mechanisms cytomegalovirus infection may act worsen clinical outcome SARS-CoV-2 infection, discusses potential links could investigated, assesses potential significance findings emerge. Life definitely go back normal 70% hit. people think fine begin they’ve shot, also chunk population vaccinated (ex: 20% - especially people would vectors promoting spread like front line workers, essential workers, etc) begin push R0 value 1, therefore reducing spread transmission significantly. 100% right. People stopped caring think over. Fuck, schools opening. ridiculous. Neighbors parties. Saw doctor spit ground. getting downvoted. I'm sure though.

Edit: Grammar Buzzfeed original source, cited NYT piece, mods won’t allow posts Buzzfeed odd reason. Really? 40 60% school, give month two they'll see cases too. Daycare day camps seen fairly small numbers cases, they're much smaller operations summer better weather. public schools poor ventilation going cold flu season. one predict future, would shocked forced close Jan 1st. sacré bleu!  bro! *COUGH* dear friend COrnelius VIDanchi!
Come play come out!!! NH one homogenous states country. can't argue point. generalizing entire population experience might select make better them. understanding adverse side effects occur 3% people much less severe caused traditional pharmaceutical antidepressants. copper?

Combination things guess. herd immunity, vulnerable hiding apartments &amp; mask usage lowers R value.

I'm London, we're seeing thing. thing Sweden also.  Yeah sorry, supposed question. Even protests spread virus(which evidence points otherwise), many people would consider important virus haircut Probably not.

If Biden wins, screws up, lose Governorship. Also, elections presidential elections extremely lower voter turnout. like living Ferrel scene ""I FEEL LIKE IM TAKING CRAZY PILLS"" right? work keeps gaslighting everyone thinking safe come back office masks ""only needed sitting desk"", moving around im like??? 6 months people understand airbourne means. long would guys comfortable around SO/sleep bed/have handle baby/kiss positive test? 6 month old negative husband positive. isolated negative fam members separate home. Trying figure go home. 18 days since suspected exposure 10 says since positive test able return normal vulnerable + carers vaccine, that's probably smaller group vaccinate percentage young people we'd need reach herd immunity. Anyone doubts PPE hand washing Idiot. We've enough hard data since beginning virology understand washing hands sort mask prevent bad shit going bad shit going infact work. 


Yes, mask 100 percent filter. 50 percent filter still filters 50 percent. that's better 0 filtering. handwashing. Yeah, cleaning hands sanitize forever prevent viral contact. Washing still offers 'clean hands' several hours however 'dirty' right away. 


That shit like needs explaining adults day beyond me. Doubtful. Summer weather schools helped get here. likely we'll see third wave month two everywhere. Colympics. talking about? NY got hit hard hard enough achieve herd immunity. 

NY population: 19.45M
NY recorded cases: 444K

This 2% population.

You need hit certain threshold infected population achieve herd immunity, scientists estimate around 50% less contagious diseases, 80% infectious diseases. Mayo Clinic thinks 94% something contagious measles.

Environmental lifestyle factors predispose excessive NF-kB activation include pro-inflammatory 'western' diet, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, lack immune challenge infancy, abnormal gut microbiota, lack vitamin D, exposure environmental chemicals, food chemical allergies hypersensitivity reactions.

Unlike westerners, Africans tick nearly many boxes, might say low income residents developing countries, India, high impact. think low average age, low rates obesity, natural diet, sunlight exposure exposure pathogens allergens infancy 'train' immune system overreact probably important factors, particularly last one. said, lack testing lack reporting could well even significant factors.

People African descent living west, exposed environmental lifestyle factors predispose 'western diseases', even susceptible obesity diseases associated excessive NF-kB activation, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension etc, risk factors severe COVID-19.

So bubble of... 500? middle pandemic? 6 months pandemic end sight. Still seeing videos looting, rioting protesting innocent people BLM restaurants wearing masks.

Facebook toxic shit Whats worse masses conditioned believe every word people say, disgusting. fact people can't realize played like fiddles entire life following wrong people concerning. way Sinopharm vaccine works inferior Oxford vaccine, knowledge. that's case UGA. university reporting positive tests reported covid tracking app regardless test administered. 698 number outdated. suppose used Canada example. right fucking next door got much lower death rate. school fine standing firm, sick kids ther hand... gets another test negative school teachers say take masks sitting class room. time wear mask hallway, otherwise need Yeah get things could better. time hospitals overwhelmed, know people like hear economy important fine line shut open back up. 

I think people good wearing masks helped ton.

I want us get complacent ton fuck ups start pretty good job. RemindMe! 6 weeks them. Lots countries, mostly Asian, gotten control. Turns leaders already commonly seen dolts actually dolts. think nitrogen cooled hand held luggage common medical supplies need it. Yup, girlfriend massively extroverted. last 6 months (she's freelancer sfx) broken bit. lack work lack socialising socially detached/anxious me. heartbreaking. She'll fine eventually, increase social interaction helped, but, yeah feel extroverts. social situations always fuck smoke something. There's opposite that. That’s take it. one things can’t spun forever can’t changed lying it. modern GOP hasn’t deal lot things can’t lied away it’s like don’t even understand yet can’t. 

Tbh sociopath part brain can’t wait impending arrival virus rural communities denying existence didn’t affect *them.* Like, hospitals Des Moines, Iowa serve 1.1 million people total 170 ICU beds. That’s going fucking suck.(The rest brain realizes horrible is.) envy person enforce mask policy children teenagers. support envy them. Yes agree. seems people decided small gatherings live, opposed massive beach parties popped places like Florida. Wear mask. still one year turning antivaxxer conspiracy theorist :p I’m parents stepping up. wife stay home mom 2 boys. Helps ton keep top homework prepared. Unfortunately, fewer families luxury parent staying home. can’t control home life.

What control learning process school. States keep lowering standards testing approvals, help teachers job weed ones job? Twat thinks survived can't bad NHS worked must getting plenty funding. Self serving cunt. absolutely agree. studies backing healthier people catching Covid it’s nowhere near severe. 

They place Covid spreads. isn’t saying don’t take precautions going, definitely go you’re considering already COVID-19? mean safe anyway? led rabbit hole. Seems cocoa shit ton flavonols (type polyphenol). best bet non-Dutch dark chocolate. Red/purple/blue fruits also good like plums, red delicious apples, ect. say somewhat jest get diagnosed COVID sitting around fuck might well eat dark chocolate, apples, red wine lmao. agree lol even accounting population density US failing miserably compared places like Vietnam (shares land border China, densely populated areas like Ho Chi Minh City), South Korea, almost like practically nothing pretending something say nothing better something. control mean need vaccine. Life can't return pre-covid normalcy people vaccinated Better luck next time. RIP. Nick Cordero. Well people don’t take responsibility choose ignore face zero repercussions looks much like “Make Wish” trip, wasn’t sure “Good News!” yay, is:

“In effort humanize recovery process, Hospital del Mar Spain taking patients transferring ICU seaside.”

I would love this. patient HCPs. 👏 Yeah figured, wanted point out. 

It’s interesting definitely saw gatherings here. guess low viral presence northeast made safer. Plus people seemed smart gatherings. Boris thanks press steps inside Number 10. latest aide rushes him, fear shining whites eyes. 

""Sir, chamber ready, heated precisely 24 degrees,"" aide says.

""Good,"" Boris says, undoing tie removing wig. Already skin separating. aide sees tries move door, Boris blocks path, clothes shedding mass. Boris' face red slipping floor, eyes two masses vibrating scarlet.

""Sir, please. waited. asked. wife wants home. steak night, sir.""

Boris' head single humming mass red viral cells, drone louder terror fills room. used mouth opens, something like voice says ""*we shall feast, hunger cannot abated.*""

The aide drops knees cries, knows shall eat steak tonight. could understand people taking road trips visit attractions, stayed home states, fact that’s good idea, instead “visiting” another state, use pandemic explore home state, every state something unique it, something new discover... People always need plumbs Cool. canadian article covid canada sooooo..... miss punchline? He's talking protests demonstrations.

We fairly unusual phenomenon lasted year (and stopped covid), people protesting mass seemingly vague reasons.

The gist middle class becoming poorer poorer, feeling always asked make sacrifices taxes targeting them, upper class better ever. Add growing disconnect situation capital rest country. Well many disagree Trudeau also downplay covid.  understand skepticism reporting. state deaths far somehow managed keep nursing homes better many states? makes sense. Nobody would take placebo. Everybody would take real thing. studies BS.  small selfish portion population certainly want bars reopen, give rat's ass gets harmed. True care get downvote , people sub realize canceling Olympics mean? people really rooting Olympics next year? year totally get next year don't.

How much money would Japan loose many people loose jobs Olympics cancel?

 Athletes prepare events years tell like hey Olympics even Olympics bubble? Let's hope find way them. completely right. seemed like easy joke make instead then? Shut schools vaccine? 

But years vaccine that’s soon?

So continue shutdown even it’s shown ineffective?

And nearly epidemic remember totally believing saw video offered everyone tea like cute old lady. worked. People truly don’t understand research. Sure may drag bit 2021 say life nothing live favorite things (sports me) never coming back, utterly ridiculous flat stupid.

If truly meant truly believe that, still spreading negatively, really reading advancements made, etc. it’s mind boggling stupid people sub r/iamverybadass 3 worker behind counter time. One customer mask all. couple customers wearing masks properly. Sign right door we're supposed wear masks right know man, events regarding US left dead people wake? final tally even. That’s they’re coming Northern New England, least that’s feels perspective... doubt real debate about. countries prioritize day stipends daycare. Working elementary teacher currently community homeschooling group seriously, Keelung masks kids easier dealing parents. America outbreak, Americans currently welcomed countries world. Trump handled virus better, none needed happen. Remember GOP response March, cases going zero, like magic. tip iceberg twat. I'm ok this. high overall mortality spread silently month populations vulnerable people know protect thanks federal government's botched testing rollout lying virus contained. sure higher NJ MA. Vermont New Hampshire relatively low well. we're talking daycare, is. used everclear extra concerned leave groceries sit couple days. food safe, open flames. Wiping cans glass jars disinfectant hurt food. extremely dodgy sources got there. contribute high-quality information. 



This joke. course, could agenda would expect that? someone infected infects grocery store it’s problem. briefly hopeful too, can’t change spots.

I’m terrified though, shielding long time, moved seeing people fortnight, I’m once-twice week. feels ok, though won’t take much go back level safety two. school person 3 weeks 2 students 200 wear masks class single case Covid. dimmer switch less half darkness. CoronaBoris Surely people still arguing schools closed? Hahaa whole sub gone shit. Turns r/coronavirus scientifically illiterate Trump nuts FB timeline keep posting vitro experiments shitty observational studies support hydroxy 😭 People blame media anti vaxxer, anti medicine, anti science rhetoric 100% agree that. 

But see flip-side media sensationalism. Like targeted control groups make something look dangerous common actually is. boggles me, media illiteracy. NYC first... Everything open here. stores even removed social distancing markings returned back normal. Today Labor Day, Disney parks Universal parks capacity. It’s nuts. think first thing would look jobs demand area. pulled one measures nationwide demand also see resources county state offer. Google phrase like ""[my county state] employment resources"" see comes back. live affluent county, job search counseling resources excellent. county offer something similar, check out.

If willing relocate, certainly seems various medical technician assistant positions well registered nurses high demand right now. one jobs require training certification however, need familiarize reputable programs would train job like include robust placement assistance. hard-earned dollars would pay training, want make sure put towards full cycle program proven track record time finding placement graduates.

I also highly recommend go site like USAJobs.com look types jobs federal government hiring area job qualifications are. could also dig county state job openings well get sense hiring for. decide type training education would need go route.

Finally, reach US Congress person. Ask speak constituent liaison staff member explain looking resources assistance finding career path. surprised. representative going office somewhere within district, also highly recommend showing person always makes impression. Plumbing fairly easy know work hands. liked Reno. like Vegas crazy people better weather. Honestly casinos killer food, cant complain. Dont care gambling free drinks throwing quarters friends bad. arcades sick. mean everyone carry like vaccine too. 

Check back next year around July vaccine shows we’ll see everyone’s at. too. I've tried tolearn real risks focus them. I'm fatigued people whined complained dragged feet taking precautions beginning though. ones never really tried feel deserve go risky things impact others. lot them. real moron want something dramatic leave EU effectively deal potentially fuck future country tired hearing it. Thank you. Let's assume everyone complied 100%. think there's large discrepancy NY's nursing home deaths NJ MA? NY much larger death/capita?

Population density explain fewer elderly died NY also killing relatively young people. Perhaps able keep nursing homes, nowhere else. countries would argue otherwise.

And certainly expect better current state globally. Thanks clarification! Yeah surprised automod misinformation warning *actual disinformation* subs get Listen, i'm disagreeing points making except wishing death part. think wishing evil shit people, matter evil are, good thing help anyone. probably one reasons prison situation america fucked up.  Pence shit. Look NC USA.  Low. 

But yeah, apparently don't. r/nottheonion zombies appear? Trump admin floated rescinding visas foreign students remote learning abroad. stupid sounds. walking by, bridge, are, stuck bridge. Perhaps take handout still offered friendly manner: **The exact number people may kill profit zero**. People belt-fed academia anything else either trust DIY skills, especially since they're increasingly places yet would still liable damages to. Plumbers electricians needed ever, surge idleness decades mismanaged education housing. said doubt there's plenty entitled pricks too, whole mess result policy much people. Source? Another commenter said 3 cases reinfection cited CDC said confirmed cases reinfection. things outside instead inside, also learned 1918 influenza pandemic. Hell, held school classes outside! Winter coming. Yeah like everything else phrase herd immunity completely politicized people arguing two completely different definitions it. told everything looked forward canned, mandatory butt sitting, jobs, dating/social life beyond computers, treated like baby well 2020 sucks!

I miss convention season. take 4000 IU per day. higher officially recommended still safe dose. pre-meditated attack Asian individual. 

This ""this guy Wuhan? Hold coffee try funny"" moment.

He failed miserably. 

We've made mistakes like this. guy ""reveal"" dark racist side anti-asian sentiment. sucks humor can't exactly read crowd computer screen. apology sufficient. propane heater accessories. Hmm, pretty sure can. title misflaired bright side we'll vaccines long second half next year. Imagine Trump Biden together right debate something (assuming gets done then.) well thing ninja chicks mortal kombat, might bad Winnie Pooh ban dumb, can't believe many people think true.

Also, one notices name ""Winnie"" weird? One big issues drain resources high risk individuals infected develop covid. immunize vulnerable populations first quickly reduce demand resources reduce risk medical personel. Vaccinating less likely need medical intervention seems like would prolong things. Ya, report made everyone laugh. sound crude mask would cut half repertoire ..lol Yes, follow. That's assumption - based correlation know whether holds true.

You mind need numerical evidence confirm beaches much less densely populated protests.

Your density obsession straw man. HEADLINE ARTICLE makes definitive claim whether protests led covid outbreaks.

You continuing make absolute jackass crowd one. Take xanax. nice evening. Agree! less pandemic societal governmental response gets me. population 

Commenter meant everyone, hospitalized COVID patients. hospitalized, it’s expected might see take longer recover. fair, that’s also might expect anyone catches respiratory disease overweight, unhealthy, old. google Congo situation found article 2018, [Vaccine causing polio Africa? Context polio outbreak Democratic Republic Congo case strain virus rendered safe vaccinating people regained disease-causing abilities genetic mutation. That’s sort similar bugs common problems developed countries, like staphylococcus gonorrhea, stop responding antibiotics: acquire genetic mutations make resistant certain drugs. important consider level risk associated vaccine-linked outbreaks, cases paralysis, compared effects polio unvaccinated population. attenuated poliovirus vaccine may lead four five cases paralysis among every million individuals vaccinated, would likely thousands cases serious disease among million exposed, unvaccinated people.

In case looks like statistically vaccine helped orders magnitude harmed. Nice.  wanted wedding child uhhh yeah probably gonna skip wedding plan baby anyhow. eggs drying gotta hatch suckers soon. BTW fact harassed one. People agreed doing. also van parks government buildings DeSantis house says ""DeathSantis"".

You know shit story clearly stop fucking talking. Northeastern: Going protesting cause covid

Also Northeastern: expels 11 kids hanging Let's see happens time! something similar, way even knew was, middle November 2019, worst ""cold "" life, spent 3 days bed, getting use bathroom eat, even showered, felt like dying, fever stopped 4th day. already decided feel good 4th day gonna drag ass hospital, underlying conditions im 39 anytime get cold barely feel it, nose gets runny voice changes otherwise feel same, still work chose stay home get co-worjers sick. 

In words time cold past barely registers one hit like brick. know long long shot covid I'm sure. Lower median age even factor vaccine article inactivated one, live attenuated one. I’m bitter changing actions Yeah rather talk close me. Maine's go similar. keeping numbers time, wedding 65 guests (so far) resulted 3 deaths 147 positives (the wedding month ago numbers still climbing). pastor officiated wedding started outbreak church. Total mess. They're ordering two vaccine candidates case one passes, border also accounts booster shot. smart investment  Yet handled pandemic better US. Dumb mootherfuckers Lol, unscientific garbage. increased fat content puts extra pressure internal organs, causing damage. 

So, words, fat people's lungs heal slowly fat puts pressure lung. someone obviously know much stuff, opining something clearly little knowledge mislead push misinterpretation? agree, know view “just joke” goes far beyond moment classroom. 

Behavior like rubs students teachers. helps spread acceptance degrading Asians Covid. really want get that, would Americans shamed Covid, Asians. don’t see big rush. can’t handle another year without married, maybe shouldn’t be. 

There literally difference later. later responsible thing shows you’re selfish prick. Let's stay safe, parent sees virtual birthdays substitute kid appreciates it. one else see prime time get married without pressure throwing big wedding? 

I totally get people always dreamed big friends family. take advantage super intimate immediate family court house wedding save cash! philly making stereotypes. I'll take 5 doses head, mate sister same. cautious pandemic reddit seems believe vaccine, think corona last forever, think shitty person leave house. like something give fact. people minding business, jo shmo fucking losers comes around ""haunts"" wearing grim reaper costume. get fucking life, charlie brown. childish! Well, long ago people shot trying leave Natchez quarantine 1797 yellow fever epidemic. shooters prosecuted considered self defense public duty prevent spread. forgotten millions people lost jobs? families going life altering events?

The way socialise also changed drastically non party goers. hugs, kissess types contact anymore friends non-inmediate family members, important you? Also saying you’re gonna sex (which not, say...), wear mask. that’s turn on. Abstince vs possible ICU/permanent Covid damage... Anyone die cases? anyone wondering country 20 million ordered 4-fold excess doses:

The deal covers two different promising vaccine candidstes, Australian one Oxford vaccine. way one prove efficacious. order also accounts booster shot likely required realize 60% USA population (or more) 1 things

So forgetting age range people die 60-85, obese diabetes age, good change may die, things, stay home, quarantine yourself. 

So repeat last time heathy population forced quarantined? ...which Europe better Asia... oh wait... France 17 death per day currently. Scaled around 5x match population deaths per day still like 10x lower. possible majorty people live like hermits. jobs, errands, etc. stay home time. suuuuuuuuuuuuuuure wasn't....... gimme fucking break! told whooooolleee time, type large social gathering = bad VIRUS!!!

now told ""oh ..actually..these protests riots fact large social gatherings actually contribute BIG rise cases? rallies, parties, things did, SOCIAL JUSTICE gatherings ok..you see? large gatherings BAD! BAD BAD

fuck country common sub tear gas Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique identify virus, opposed antibody test.

Explained get help going anywhere"".

Because realistic. stop evictions forever. Eventually millions Americans going homeless. Lockdowns (especially people getting help) realistic. probably limit 3 weeks. Anyone willing go event like wearing masks socially distancing outside event. Dude it’s insane. live Waldo county neighbor works Knox county. outbreak works able trace back wedding! It’s crazy! point, think people still shit world beat COVID-19 deserves get it. probably limit 3 weeks. Anyone willing go event like wearing masks socially distancing outside event. Indoor dining also problem. bars places different join military become imperious? also point.

Suggesting I'm fault (or ""consented"") get covid ask everyone come contact every day anything stupid last night/weekend (which, let's honest, they're probably fucking selfish admit anyway) absolutely ludicrous. That's exactly what's wrong US days. one gives fuck anyone else knows, care, actions affect others. thought people learned children, wrong.

The people went wedding assholes. Every infection traced back line (which could literally thousands) exactly 100% fault. want know data? nobody top puts studies balls big enough call shit, cut crap say large gatherings = large gatherings. matter protests, riots concerts. would get TORN FUCKING SHREDS, politically pussylike nation right boss threw large birthday party supervisor went wedding weekend. family bbq skipped. People dumb. lot missing countries. hope people good p much always understanding people still jerk Woodstock teens literally sit parents' basements smoke bad weed front black light Hendrix posters. mean power them, want talk basement dwelling... booo, get better material average age general population lower 61. someone 71 much higher chance retired go “Little bit child abuse”?? Seems was/is fairly rampant Catholic Curch, thousands kids involved, millions legal funds payouts. so............we live life normally festivals stuff, wear masks measures elaborate little this? explain exactly PCR reagent kit would do? Hopefully lot sooner leaders say ""no , cannot"". total bullshit politically motivated. riots protests happen, ""they"" make excuse ""but masks"", live life normally, masks? correct? O.o going logic ""they large gatherings, used masks!"" lol next summer... don’t really see hiking urgent civil rights protests, shows difference priorities. No, thank you. you, New Jersey. - from?

- Florida

- oh, let get hazmat suit one big oof noodle right here. :( wrong tag That's lot. surprising. Okay? Show said that..... That's right. didn't.


He harass anyone. That's fact. ive seen every pic every large gathering protest past 4 months. hypocrites! States prioritizing bars. They’re looking bar school saying ‘bar opens first’. They’re looking businesses reopen metrics hit. prioritization going Imagine losing job career virus smart though!! knows infect ""woke"" people! virus side social justice!! didnt know!? riots protests large gatherings! simply JUSTICE!!!!!!!!!!

only things large gatherings \- unprofessional professional setting.

\- Joining ""let's bash Asians"" mentality instead setting good example teacher.

Yeah, guy deserves lose job. could leave US go Europe, probably would have! got married June. kept 16 people. Everyone state one flying. Everyone self quarantined 2 weeks after. Masks traveling party bus beach (for drivers protection) back. Nobody got sick everybody good time. Zoom make watch wedding. 

Take precautions people. work. sorry election America pandemic longer concern diners resume doors. I'll take vaccine, I'll get back normal. someone grew catholic school life, brings INMENSE JOY! TRAUMA gay growing listening sin going burn hell really stick 😌🌌🌈.  I've attorneys review everything unfortunately well within right they're doing. Technically since still wedding, albeit want, could've said year restrictions. Covid can’t tell protesting wedding. sars cov2 fun fact. Thank subscribing. Yup. like contact tracing seems like places decided bother. Even cases LOW yap. that's point! biased horseshit! im apolitical dont give shit sides. im high anyone's ass....but SERIOUSLY make article say ""protests riots lead rise cases"" still large gatherings...but scold rage people large gatherings outdoor concerts, rallies, motorcycle rallies, shit like that?

that's BIASED FUCK based NOTHING political climate personal views. 

disgusting Well, average age patients average age cause wear tear problems people’s lungs, may cause heal slowly. Also increased fat content puts extra pressure internal organs, causing damage. one wouldn’t cause slower healing lungs sample 60% male. know that. lot overlap sure, India Pakistan diverse countries populations homogeneous. one time one country map mean become everywhere. 15 ACH? That’s dubiously high, kind building that? Lab? Why? 20M people so... Yea don’t bunch drunk asses yelling eat other’s faces music loud Olive Garden Stalling vaccine College kids wont party. kiss fucking. list goes on. good beginning pandemic weather getting warmer plenty without crammed inside bunch infectious dolts, tomorrow drops nearly 30 degrees today gets worse there. It’s honestly ground breaking sci fi series! modern classic. hard get American eith previous knowledge Chinese history. it’s well worth trump snowflakes fucking stupid. Seriously. That's consequence short news cycle people long term memory. COVID old news, now. people seem complying mask mandates area, unless affects loved one directly, they're going give much thought, beyond that. article density people whether led covid outbreaks

the article amount population density required make covid.

your statement said given beaches half population dense expect half much infection. except say anything population density needed infection. know read article.

meanwhile keep insisting upset pretty abusive.

In short, know talking about. talk nonsense authority like avatar Dunning Kruger.

I'm done conversing you. past stages 1&amp;2 safety, stage 3 efficacy. long volunteered, probably did, see much wrong this. dumb, fire him. delayed May October said screw eloped last week. Absolutely regrets Good. one went actually shut year ago. multiple priest sex scandals course two decades. assume dropping testing monkeyed with. Stupid, many thousands people depressed commuting work started crying. know else say, love r/microdosing. . That’s really nice you. husband eloped Vegas January year. planning celebrate March Shanghai family, since COVID... don’t know able go China. I’m telling people decide exact opposite telling do. free will. you’re uncomfortable, make choice isolate. want take risk willing right mind make decision, good you. don’t remember past condemned repeat it. particularly easy vaccinate against, 40 teams worldwide working independent vaccine candidates, using 6 major different tactics developing vaccines. leading ones manufacturing at-risk internal pipelines parallelized. fact epidemic spread means phase 3 trails completely months. None serendipitous accident. similarly damaging pandemic would produce kind worldwide vaccine research response (probably even better digesting lessons learned pandemic), there's evidence future COVIDv2 would necessarily take 4-15 years develop vaccine. also knew certainly April antibodies spike protein RBD likely work produce ADE vaccine development possible. That's ok. heard alright Easter anyway. planning wedding June 2021. Realized quickness even then, it'll probably shit show. Put 2022. Fiance getting married Halloween people live witnesses.

The party wait.

If can't wait get married, something small. fact, got advice PRE-COVID. Actually getting married beforehand seems reduce wedding planning stress overall.

I put people love risk. someone help understand get really excited low test positivity rates?

I’m always skeptical metrics it’s really easy increase testing. state hovers around 1% now. numbers slowly increasing they’ve slowly increasing total number tests. governor keeps highlighting 1% positivity metric. people gave up

This possibly one best analogies I've heard. 9 million people PNG also vaccinated. 

Sounds like PNG problem, Australian problem. much yet. still really spoken anyone, I'm sure parents pretty disappointed. thing live different state already kind avoiding all, much could fall begin with. reason go Walmart

Same fuck talking bot? Tldr; yes. 

Just clean yourself. Tell it. Fall/winter 2019 lousy time me. Really thought things would turn around 2020... Give masks. That’s incredible! Great job pivoting succeeding trade like 40 tickets finger trap pieces candy right? much understand happening losing job, April found next job month ago. Also virus hurt someone close you, sucks. though, I’ve honestly enjoyed whole family home. wife took opportunity diet start running. kids centered less exhausted school/daycare. Don’t get wrong. would like alone time there, shut period actually good family. know overshoot much Well they're also diabetic (which obese people higher risk of) slow healing. course that's dude replying saying. Sinovac still sounds like vacuum 80s  ""fight."" said stop telling people do. exactly doing.

Also yes... know saying saw post. mean laws wrong one's Johnnyhgstatus disagrees one's scrap. telling rest us do. Honestly, even distance.

I've bunch protests directly outside apartments. (certainly all, most) protesters wore masks, certainly 6 feet distance people. chanting screaming cases playing music dancing. Many protests look different average festival (other masks). Good. People medical field need support. sure, gauging people Reddit mostly idea. time rebuked Sweden. shown. 

People easily swayed headlines, interesting watch. confusing. also likely catch home. tf. closed Mexicans entering US US citizens entering Mexico way used false.

That's better. bro. I'm straight good time. dude hasnt done video anywhere secluded home woods months. always feel really sleepy afterward I'll take hour nap right rain Sorry, bus/metro fill capacity due social distancing. Please wait 45 mins next one. México healthcare system universal even available foreigners poorly founded decades. probably worst timing Mexico Sweden did, right? Extremely sensitive topic. don’t inputs student view this. Americans try socialize often joke. However, timing could worse. genuinely don’t opinion intentions.

What experience. teach undergrads since moved online there’s soooo much controversy around. simply covering topics Social Psychology way go, might accused something. 

It’s exhausting. I’m trying give lectures avoiding mention politics, race, income, body size, etc. skipped sisters grad party June. dragged mud choice. Fuck em. Buncha blissful idiots. learned lessons wearing masks following restrictions, play here? 

And severe restrictions now? restaurants bars still outdoor only? Senegal great place live. lived two years. I'd love go back someday.  tell Chinese. said, think lose job stupid joke though. 

As tone-deaf seemed come across, think go far firing someone either; maybe disciplinary action, long message sufficiently clear see reason unless confirmed professor blatantly malicious. [npr university Columbia would testing people symptoms. addition, university officials saying people tested positive campus [were inform school.  feels like university really care whether get sick not,"" 

Back March, Thailand’s Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul [warned fellow Thais ‘white’ foreigners ..... none farang wearing masks reason country infected around. careful farang Asians.”  moment winter Europe farang come Thailand hide disease. Many farang dress dirty don’t shower. hosts careful.”

6 months later, Thailand [very Covid U.S #1 (America First coronavirus policy) even Canada-U.S. border still closed end sight. professor brainwashed badly misinformation/disinformation aware one want see person. mention [Wuhan reported single local Covid case Mizzou [551 student last week.  heads fall? I’m seeing virus fatigue everywhere right now. 

This certainly opened eyes people really are. started quarantine March 15th. awhile, leaving house week groceries. gradually added 2 family members, occasional target. always mask up, maintain distance. onset though, saw yoyo's acting though life normal. said then, clear now, long people act like fools, we'll continue isolation. God forbid 1 solid month mandatory quarantine, reasonably normal life. Instead, we're 6 months later, made progress. frustrating. peak 725 new cases August 5. Today 41 new cases appears substantial progress. can't feel bad people. What? say ""it's herd immunity"" immediately followed ""they herd immunity, case skyrocket drop restrictions""? Literally post front page saying people hid Anne Frank breaking law people looking obeying law. 

Just it’s “law” doesn’t mean it’s right. Stop bowing people stripping basic rights freedoms. you’re functioning adult human, make mind decide yourself. you’re scared, stay home. That's painful. stopped therapy February felt prepared handle own. happened.  yeah exactly ! like go woods ocean something beautiful. reception ""real wedding"" things stable people vaccinated. 

how going look kids ask wedding say, ""well, kids. global health crisis happening experts seriously condemned large gatherings potential outbreaks, decided people watching us get married celebrating us important listening experts caring community large."" Yeah. Well, guess dealt virus June.  Yes, many organic wines there, even corporate chain stores. confirm. depressed. He's even crazier Trump, nothing them?  Screw indeed. 

My *first* grandchild *only* child (daughter) born late January. didn’t touch either *months* lockdown March. I’m best person keeping high risk mom supplied home, couldn’t risk getting infected all. family responsible understanding even though fucking hard going. 

I lot contempt prioritize wants safety people around them. holding new baby middle global killer pandemic want. Good keeping family safe, screw anyone gives *any* grief it.

And congrats new arrival! *even* restaurant?

/s someone died 60 years ago (this month seems) bearing happens today. kill everyone risk, people die. Exactly! hubbie got married small - friends family meant us- would’ve mortified desire share special day led anyone getting sick worse, dying. Oh wow! First heard finally strength call get waitlist mental health issues. It’s truly terrible me, started COVID, feel last 6 months certainly accelerated decent. problem figures spike people start taking seriously start putting masks back taking precautions, start decline many people assume things magically getting better don’t careful anymore, course leads new spike. 

People anxious get back normal they’ll see declining numbers assume job done. U.S government learned nothing. learned lot started changing habits. Don’t eat out, don’t hang out, don’t people over. didn’t already ton video games books board games plus streaming video platforms. I’d probably crazy right now. They’ll probably deny anyone caught covid wedding, they’ll say things like “how could know sure??”

If someone went wedding came back uninfected, would act going immoral? never change minds, want dictatorship back baaaad Please take me. want Sinovac vaccine. malls. parties. food. sweep streets exchange food bed. Pressuring intervening. trying intervene. He's trying pressure. reference comment. 

Yes word ""trying"" fact imply deed completed lol. give pension? counting benefits pension would big factor difference compensation.

My biggest reason avoiding private schools NYC disparity pay (total comp, including pension benefits) teachers public school system private schools. Public school teachers compensated nearly double rate private. end, left private schools unable compete part public teaching talent, already scarce. way I'm glad, they're damn expensive. know exactly much cost sister go one kids know uniforms alone hundreds thousands dollars.  much sub hates it, called ""herd immunity."" Without restrictions, NY cases would go up, frankly there's enough people R1 unless there's like app connect people without immunity other, hang hug whatnot. Probably didn’t set solid capacity limit. states banned gatherings 50, many states allowing weddings 50% venue capacity. venue capacity 600 it’s perfectly legal hold 300 person event. I'd put bulk blame government. responded sensible fashion, societal response bad. 

I know government always dealt corruption, never thought could reach magnitude, transparent. idea what's going become country whether I'm going future it. I've learned anything history, there's nothing stopping fascist ruler taking country. know, could beginning end country. that's what's depressing. Every time friends bring the, ""imagine going lock-down 6% mortality"" BS. tell main reason lot states went lockdown getting PPE start damn near impossible. places needed essential supplies like hospitals nursing/long term care facilities could get supplies. personal experience working hospital, getting random hand sanitizers like rest us grocery stores. Purells incredibly difficult get ""proper"" disinfectant wipes even worse acquire. shit show trying get right PPE something many talking about. article says? paywalled. family experience this,it’s serious. third paragraph spot on. Well said. Let's hope so. Also OH, local district two football games now, marching band, concessions, whole lot. (My high school kid online sure hell marching band year.)

We screwed. Pretty much everywhere. Downtown Orlando, night clubs open, masks, ppl crowed sidewalks clubs.  can't say one ""yeah government take care us"" people used lot faith public institutions humanity general this. like I've aged 7 years 7 months. Nobody take joke days Wellbutrin SSRI though. think blocks reuptake dopamine norepinephrine. Add St John’s Wort &amp; good Vitamin supplement diet - you’re going feel boost energy &amp; positivity. Also try meditation never have, really change life. great apps ton free content like Breethe (my favorite), Insight Timer, Headspace many meditations 10 15 minutes long really change outlook bad day, soothe anxiety, lull sleep. Really. Seriously. it. regret making part life. apologize Got it, chance link you’d recommend? Trying make sure keep everyone safe! using thick reusable masks (passes point light fabric + blow lighter test) would love protection. Seems every China post sub filled spam comments 'Sure China', 'Yeah right' countries contained outbreak successfully like Vietnam Thailand Hey, server/bartender here. Distancing Jack doors virus aerosol hovers air hours, blown everywhere air conditioning. ABSOLUTELY putting us risk, bc can't wear mask eating drinking NOONE puts mask seated. high risk self gets play Russian roulette everyday bc people selfish. ARTICLE CASE PAYWALL

You see hundreds, thousands, people partying Fremont Street little social distancing sometimes without masks.

Witnesses say police called break fight one point.

Gov. Sisolak issued warning Friday people gathering Labor Day.

Health officials like Dr. Fauci also advising people take precautions Labor Day holiday. Please start bs me. 

I real problems. I'm Gwyneth Paltrow. 

Please keep condescending advice yourself. 

You obviously idea going through. ""Exercise"" ""water"" going help. Throat punching people recommend things sound helpful. Ahhh ok makes sense. It’s exciting Here’s thing though, issue isn’t 1 2 venues it’s entire wedding industry. entire wedding industry thrives taking financial advantage couples. wedding tax real get caught trying get around you’ll get charged wedding price anyway. 

Deposits often non refundable often 50% upfront. 

It’s likely many couples going wedding simply can’t afford to. Now, don’t think couples 200 guest weddings, lot smaller weddings happening could situation. 

Unfortunately, nothing black white comes weddings covid. industry resisting adapting pandemic. highly recommend book “Lost Connections” Johann Hari. It’s cure stretch (it’s book, case audio book), hearing someone discuss science behind depression societal disease rather something inherently wrong person, great boost me. really helped pop was. Maybe help too. course Ohio increasing. qent Wal Mart yesterday people wore mask get security took off. people talk know vaccines cure, also think they're one-and-done good go.

These folks keep seeing positive headlines misleading ""multiple vaccines available November"" read ""Multiple cures nearly available all"". They're making Labor Day plans schools reopened hospitals get overrun.

These anti-maskers deniers. regular people followed news. see county dozen cases, cure way, open schools overrunning hospitals means comfortably barbeque friends family again. probably go movies plane anytime soon they're basically done isolating within various friend groups. Goodhart's law action. First tied opening/closing positivity rate, waste resources testing people likely infected keep positivity rate down.  Erring* 20-30+ percent population NY immune coronavirus. 

People really full think behavior NYC-ers significantly unique different big cities US cause infections drop stay low since May. feel this. Haven’t depression bad entire life. Slowly getting better feels like. get low don’t think handle it. things back ashamed of, historically speaking. However seems moral fiber ripped souls Americans nobody seems care. BBC? also Reuters, NBC, ABC, CNN, NYTimes..... pretty common knowledge. Lmao bullshit. Ridiculous mass media completely manipulates people. okay, outdoor concerts beach trips okay too, right? think things got really bad house school started again. high schooler really social, got real crappy husband I. two kids young know better - obviously two year old know/care, five year old ok homeschool kindergarten.

Even that, would say managing, well, managing past Tuesday. plans split online school days twice week hike going minimally trafficked park hot spot homework.

Its bad. youre enough realize difference masks. arent likely get covid likely minor cold

If stay inside forever work panic course feel depressed assumes random samples decide gets tested, that's case. city capacity 1000 tests per day, they'll test sickest people. increase capacity 10,000 per day, they'll start testing people little cough. increase 20k, they'll start testing people even sick, need test work school. know hard, first hand experience since 20's.

Idk what's going mention seems people generally kind've feeling way rn.

- I've bored &amp; scoffing government incompetence. [X] Doubt Thank answering question. group decides put others risk.

That’s vague statement—what mean risk? mean risk catching Covid all? heard ‘em. warm it? :P Well, best luck man. hope parents chill one day. chest pain depression actually thing? I've dealing chest pain doctor ruled anything wrong heart. I'm wondering could explanation... LOL, months ago lock fatigue (we never even actually got locked down).  


Honestly, shit sucks, deal it. Maybe even something prevent it. Hey..., I’ll around 7 tomorrow wanna talk more. free roll-out next year

*sad face* Increasing decreasing testing would change percentage

Only sample similar. keep retesting people, start testing people unlikely virus (because test kits available), positivity rate go even proportion infected stays same. right now, miss out. bunch anti mask relatives I’m strongly encouraging mom wear mask high risk around ANYONE ANYTIME holidays doesn’t regularly wear mask public.  months. think? Bento Gonçalves pretty awesome spend day exploring. Spent lot time walking around Montenegro São Sebastião Caí. Porto Alegre pretty surreal experience. really go anywhere enjoy. Wah wah wah white victim complex 🍼 I’ve prepared whole life Colleges: cares? We’rw shutting need money!

(I’m sure colleges survive shut down....) Spoken like resident southern US state. Nah it’s shitty lol, rationalize however want. That's good question. may worth getting ones say they're medical grade avoiding ones say they're case, paper masks cheap standardized, kind hard cut corners. Sooo saying serious sarcastic tone? latter would kind uncalled completely unacceptable opinion. I’m guess former considering got fired. Kinda happens country ties much person's time identity job  Cause dying NYC critical dear leader. wish joke. Haha same.. dated storm Jan-mid March covid hit realized prospects unviable. I'd also getting better depression thing. I'm actually strongest now, feel different earlier periods low grade sadness complete social isolation job stress.

 sense sadness hipsters perhaps better prepared deal pandemic normal folks. Several friends sunk terrible lack routine disturbed sleep, exercise social time extremely hard time coming th. Whereas none new knew get works able get out.  Lol left 2 hours ago ok think you’re sadness hipster, I’ve depressed since 2015!

In seriousness, hope things get better you. Lots hurt going around rn got pull together get this. drives batshit. 

I got bottle Jack $25. estimate since 26 ounces.....and nice little pour 2oz 3oz soda. get 13 drinks one bottle $25.  

The bar block charges around $7 shittier Jack Coke that's got one little shot full ice.  folks stay home drink better beyond me. honestly think story damage public discourse dozen I've seen last 2 weeks say ""Vaccine available November!"" seriously disconnected.

I've got friends family literally think virus over. anti-maskers deniers, they're like ""I watched numbers they're everywhere, vaccine coming month cure basically here. I'm party Labor Day, in?""

I can't tell number people heard dozens positive stories, think everything good go. think vaccine CURE. also think available = regular circulation.

People smart. see 2 weeks American schools open, hospitals overrun they're going ""See? biggie. socialize like normal again, especially cures coming month so."" got try happy spite it. world absurd, need come lives derive happiness outside can't control, fight like hell can. climate change wrecks lot civilization, still look back fun time given, help could. part whats required pay rent. need asses seats buying alcohol markup. also leads bigger tipping. 

If want places survive takeout need realize move locations less square footage. cause restaurant go margins thin even good economy. like watching period pieces set 50-60s. seems like America unified hopeful. sense society progress. *definitely* problems racism whole bunch things, yeah. Probably rose tinted glasses though Thank you. Agreed, many gone without seeing family long sacrificed much, it’s infuriating see this. hope get see family soon. Unfortunately narrative proclaim ""facts"" facts narratives only, political reasons, science politicized opposing viewpoint questioning narrative censored. 

Is economy truly better printing 6T USD decimating small businesses, instilling fear everyone, putting millions work, virus know real REAL risks YES however actually low rate death we've found, claiming thing hoax no, would silly... rather manage lot better balance economy health all. yet see impact immense economic damage done well mental health damage done, experts estimate harmed alone than.

We able - smart, protect vulnerable let healthy strong keep economy running. 2020 all.

Feel like pretty naive urge everyone also live bubble fear- stop... shut forever one ever gets hurt again? 

I implore practice critical thinking skills well, information getting articles subreddit, getting full picture viewpoints situation potentially could be. I'm sorry, even really excited want support local businesses love staff spent money - everything planned, transit, dining out, karaoke, returning public-facing jobs, high risk. Sure, reduce risk masks, easing guilt partaking activities prolong pandemic hours fun? live Canada, describe would considered pretty outrageously risky here. Anyway, hope fun hope stay safe. always skeptical metrics it’s really easy increase testing.

Yep. know lot people sick all, tested return work school. fiancé little sick (very obviously COVID, stomach bug) tested return work.  months ago, tests shorter supply, would've said test quarantine two weeks.  I'm sure could provide proof this, proof is, 'reliable' sources RFA Adrian Zenz? Sorry hear man, pretty much went thing last months. ended breaking recently well COVID negative, wear mask continue business. job doesn’t really allow callouts unless you’re Covid positive it’s likely Covid. Unless point, couldn’t function I’d stay home. Upvoted. valid question. yet deaths flatlined press wants. make go faster, already access money speed things along.

They would extremely stupid push vaccine go proper trials. data becomes public approval process, people read data speak up.  case see, [it since posted below. guys go get married justice peace something, official ceremony whenever makes medical sense? birthday party daughter yesterday. wrote invite everyone wear masks, did. hadn’t brought theirs, even bought disposable ones. party outside, set tables group, one would sit anyone hadn’t come already. Then, food made utensils would touched everyone, instead, individual servings ready grabbed. live state lot people refuse wear masks, worried would go, everyone great! 

I definitely don’t want end one stories, took many precautions possible! think people conscious this, tried, small group parties, like daughter’s (about 25 people), work fine. It’s people aren’t willing follow rules. It’s annoying. learn walk talk again. 


Oof, see title meant literally well figuratively. heart goes untold amount people suffer long-term disabilities organ damage says tweet CDC numbers false, numbers CDC offers false (which person linked to). flew first class everywhere, still sound like 40k.

We flew coach everywhere. think took 8 flights doubt even added $3000. Everything meaningless power ignorance. You’re good work! matches they’re likely even keep photos! allowed opt out. Stop telling grown men women do. tp individual.  Yes, it’s less toxic scabies treatment permethrin pesticide body Well first, funding. way science works need pitch trying *someone* company decides fund research. Usually benefit them. 

With funding comes much possibility. hire people work pretty easily. conduct tests world once, properly. 

Because Corona, also get volunteers would want tests well. Many people sign trials hope early getting viable vaccine.

It also reasonable assume world gets smarter, technology, breaking records well. Maybe start temperature screening now, continue well wedding. starts get fever, make leave.

A contact thermometer big deal, especially lay thick alternative wear mask wedding. Get good baseline going now, know fever looks like future. Withings makes really nice wifi thermometer, use, $100. keep track temps though.

I know gets fever. Maybe stay hotel. maybe insist goes hotel. might able get extended stay rate local AirBNB. true can’t open country back completely wear masks practice good hygiene? 

If you’re telling across protests major effect infection numbers. college students criticized going beach attending parties? I’m lost Nobody's telling that. Go drive. Go longer walk. Go hang friends mask outside. Go camping. That's meaningless, thanks. live GA I've hearing fireworks past couple hours. Yeah, people care. True Stacking masks improves effectiveness actually. ones using effective cloth masks. Honestly, everyone using surgical masks they're readily available. Positive test rate almost less 1% time lows. No, thinking ""I want personal answer *me* I'm fucking special."" may know this, much Canada gets incredibly cold simply won’t work. 

Here Winnipeg lows like -40C. get shit together take notes already it. gross checked sub while, appears beginning, fear mongering freak show occasional legitimate story sprinkled in. 
If I'm waiting outside door keep telling ""hurry up"", I'm pressuring hurry walk outside door. I'm forcing free stay inside 

If come inside forcibly grab take outside I'm intervening. free meddled with. That's what's happening. 

Make sense? 

Pressured intervening. bar = subreddit (kind of), think 

""winnie pooh"" subreddit. 

hope clearer. live area know several people got COVID wedding. bride spread hugging everyone. also spread bachelorette party. Participation wearing masks low here. Almost every door sign says ok wear one health condition. 90% people asthma apparently. what? one person came flu would bait switch scam. 

If universities announced online classes, students pay dorm, many might even take gap year (why pay much youtube videos?).

So basically lied, said person classes, everything fine, pay tuition like usual. 

They made students sign agreement get covid, can't sue universities, university close later due ""unforeseen"" circumstances, refunds. ""Scientists reviewed claim pointed although study report higher probability coronavirus infection individuals received flu vaccine, examined seasonal coronaviruses cause common cold, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus causing COVID-19. such, results cannot extrapolated SARS-CoV-2.""

The study posted performed 2018 covid19, yeah hypothesis tested novel coronavirus. Nevertheless, possible flu vaccine could make susceptible given research. invited wedding fall. Even though it’s state infected numbers rising, schools totally virtual, masks mandatory, couple persuaded restaurant let skip precautions.

The happy couple family member died Covid, couldn’t funeral distancing. Regardless, another “we postponed, fuck we’re going ahead regardless, bride groom.” think risk get vaccinated, people okay taking risk. Plus infection levels/deaths stay low Football players show little symptoms college athletes showing heart condition symptoms after. things open high risk people isolate. works. know came ""IMHE"" model, clearly pass even basic sanity checks. 

For example, IMHE model *also* predicts China 11k covid deaths end year, despite 100 odd deaths April 1 September 1. believe that?

And funnily enough, predicted deaths last 4 months last 2 months due exponential increase. Maybe good week two advance, extrapolate year's end nonsense. said, extrapolation pretty much nonsense general assumptions changing whatnot. 

(Granted, people (you know who) would happy believe China 11k deaths year end. Maybe even write op-ed it.) problem is, morons wear mask unlikely get vaccination, even free 100% safe.  nothing?  Exactly! catholic church much money. obscene much have. say losing money able church services. parents go catholic church stopped person mass while, said please forget support church. meantime priest spending $800 k renovations purely cosmetic. priest takes annual trip Italy go Vatican. need money. Maybe allow try cover pedophiles, pay settlements legal fees. can't believe lucky got go public events! I'm saying truths, assumptions Haha aww :) humor one thing persists deepest darkest times thankful that. good enough herd immunity though. Keep mind small minority people cannot vaccinated, rely herd immunity protect them. includes infants, pregnant women, old people, people extreme allergies immune disorders. 

And always people get vaccinated acquire immunity.

Unless us get vaccinated do, virus still present population, deadly immunized. entire entertainment industry standstill - Vegas, Orlando, professional sports, college sports, countless venues shut down. Restaurants hanging thread. Small businesses rely regular subscriptions operating loss (gyms). Shutdowns universal thing. 

Why can’t live concerts Big 10 football played? you’re old enough worried virus, you’re old enough make decisions avoid areas feel high risk. said before, want know bats version SARs got mixed pangoliers version SARs without human help, somehow able say done lab, how.

I always forget I'm probably talking CCP liberal waste time someone can't see outside filter buildings nature

***head explodes***  more...just google them. Omfg. literally he's doing. He's pressing modify timeline.

Intervene - come way hindrance actually going make anyone hurry up.

And yet, persists. getting idea? seen one scientist works vaccines vaccine approval say this, let alone majority them. Mizzou history racist outrages, one first last. People win business succeed taking risks. myth. Roulette players take risks; lose; casino owners take risks; win. Anyone takes significant risks fifteen twenty times--which fraction number decisions needed open business, much less make successful--will, simply statistical realities, lose.

What enables people get rich perfectly simple obvious: care anything winning. want win anything: peace mind, leisure, pleasure, integrity, love, all, good fellow human beings. so, get money taking people want things. That's people get rich operating businesses are. without exception; good eggs, famous others. part, successful people succeed simply prioritizing goals well-being everyone else around them. mean, time spent family weddings means lot, time spent friends weddings mean lot, best memories weddings. everyone come together celebrate one best gifts life...how celebration two people jointing together life overrated? think worth more? going say 0 masks insane suppose wedding everyone eats time would’ve 0 masks 20-30 minutes dinner anyways. 

Who knows 275 people?? unsafe effective treatments speak of? no, depressed covid"" like kind sadness hipster lol

This made laugh hard, feel bad. Thank sharing this! I’ve seen site before, lots good info! realization many people willing kill number random third world citizens starvation confront virus .4% IFR average age death equivalent average age death? People forget multi trillon dollar exchange wealth flooded banks corporations virtually night. Meanwhile small business forced shut down, employees laid off, parents forced stay home work schools shut down. virus CDC admitted 94 % people died average 2.5 comorbidities. 

Not mention sketchy shit place testing (false positives/negatives). whole things stinks. like allowed phone Wants Millionaire, still fails get 1M.  I'm bridesmaid later month. Outdoor ceremony, indoor reception. 200+   Idk thing is, vaccine needed modern world. vaccines people looking kind thing vaccines near unlimited funding resources.

You full might many different countries working different approaches vaccine once. completely reasonable expect vaccine end year early 2021 long ""problem"" finding good vaccine incredibly difficult way. can't afford lose 10 15k one day event maybe it. idea much person responding makes. certainly plenty rich republicans helping. idiots poor white people thought billionaire would help life. ones screaming open small businesses (they open... one make broke Americans spend non-essential business) sending kids back school. Get vaccine, go back living normal without masks. take vaccine continue lockdown exactly numbers starting creep up...

But, real spike happen schools open. Unless flew first class everywhere, still sound like 40k. something could done. /s

""We thought nothing ideas"" Roll Tide! Smart. maybe take incident account plan rest life. values compatible? you’re wearing rose colored glasses, red flags look like flags. I’m dummy internet gotta do. Driving thru btw! 👋🏻 lot time they're responding prejudice group, much gets broadcast house every day originates NYC LA. Something really surprises US comfortable media (dominated rich people privileged backgrounds) using horribly bigoted stereotypes towards working class people rural areas ""flyover states"". live, kind stuff *used* common, generally gets called now.

People see kind stuff think ""is see us? Well fuck too!"".

Reddit filled well. lot comments see people south (especially Florida, reason) absolutely filled bile. crazy thing people guilty generally people regard tolerant, enlightened egalitarians justify accusing targets bigots. really using support one group way punching group getting away it.

I'm sure *all* New Yorkers like that, maybe even most. US media comes NYC LA, means ones still getting fair amount air time. whoever participating countries Guatemala, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Democratic Republic Congo Zambia.

And tracking total 16,000 pregnant women sure got info from, it’s absolutely maximum weekely benefit. Hmmm......wasn't caught dining in? coincidence.  Exactly. Almost everything open except bars. statement “why bars prioritized....” illogical false. guess erroring side safety isnt strategy anymore. Lots Americans need realize *intentionally* racist mean racist.

The people suffer give shit malicious fucking moron, especially unintentionally-racist people leap defense. That's fucking great. even relative who's selfish fucking postpone wedding, best friend postponed till October next year. people straight fucking stupid. Pressuring intervening interposing. saying ""hurry up"". actually going make anyone hurry up. wasn’t newish relationship thing didnt take serious ended going separated ways reach see never responds eh still prob check situation ended seeing therapist got meds depression help, agree views people don’t really wanna date start chatting things flare let’s hope things get better Even masks distancing want poor couple’s heads pike

All due respect people attended much blame. wedding date moved around equates nothing signing legal paperwork seem important me.

Weddings overrated reminds end movie War Games Whopper guessing launch codes nuclear weapons. needs one more... he's ok catching corona even child asymptomatic spread it. 

This ... disturbing FLAGSTAFF, AZ — Carol Todecheene survived COVID-19 lasting effects becoming severely ill spending nearly three weeks ventilator.

She learn walk talk again. Months getting coronavirus, still weak, dizzy trouble remembering things.

 
Doctors say medical field quite ready focus long-term effects COVID-19 vaccines works communities still working reopening.

The vast Navajo Nation Todecheene lives still daily curfews partial weekend lockdowns.

***Despite limitations, Todecheene recently went back work.*** Than. reason US backed four vaccines (hopefully) turns overkill. pooh bar 

A Pooh Bar...? work private K-12 school sticker price tuition 32K per year per student, tell fewer 20% students pay that.

Admissions also deliberately blind much money parents afford pay acceptance tuition adjusted meet family income final amount settled on. families play closer 10-12K per family. minimum payment $500 per month (6K per year), several families pay that.

So read large figures, assume everyone's actually spending that. get wrong, still schooling elevated place privilege able pay even normal 10-12K per kid. don’t really go days, I’d love sit patio it’s cold out. Jackets exist, food usually warm. guess trust most? trust president least easily filed worst we've probably ever had; science politics virus two different fields interfere. like building!? welcome. sure figures right? look 23rd 7 day average 46.1, week later 30th 50.8 increase 10%.

It increase 56 later week (2nd September) seem misrepresenting facts exaggerate point. Back USSR, believed imbibing alcohol protected radiation poisoning 🤪 that, started 6 months ago. We’re starting next 6 months huge numbers growing. what's called opinion piece. keep using word. think means think means. went brother's wedding. 10 people, including bride groom. Several tested covid negative rest quarantined. still kept mask whole time. knew risk, also one brother mom people side going. one got sick, thank god. bringing up, probably, Woodstock year Flu pandemic

No bringing context ""risk reduction costs"".

If could go back time, knowing 3 people died Woodstock, would sabotage wouldnt happen order save 3 lives?

1 person connected Sturgis died. knows *exact* conditions lets assume explicitly due Covid.

So argument ""Sturgis shouldnt happened, someone died"". 

So then, ""Woodstock shouldnt happened 3 people died"". Good thing non rna vaccine candidates likely approved later year.

The virus genome made RNA- vaccines developed using adenoviral vectors iirc. That’s mean- never vaccine developed RNA virus. literally starting square 0. assumed even Americans charge vaccine

Hahahahaha hahahahaha good one! Either troll idiot much people cold climate winters besides staying home outdoor indoor activities canceled.  are:

1. American.

2. Citing 2 sources. districts started seeing students last Wednesday. Depression personally?

Or economically? agree. Western NY open upcoming week. Cases incredibly low districts mostly opening hybrid format. criteria full opening disseminated frustrating cases numbers likely get better even vaccine released. pretty bad description low positive rates important. Low positive rates simply indicate enough testing catch cases. city 100 tests give day, they’re going use tests sick people think good chance Covid. city 10,000 tests give day, they’re going say everybody wants test get one, even you’re asymptomatic. course lead lower positive rate testing people think might it. low positive rate good indicator we’re enough testing. tests completely random logic would fine, they’re never here. wonder sanitize coffin every use. Germany #1? Ummmm.....NO want life back, I'll take risk give away place line ICU yo doubt sincerity. get less sun need eat more. could always courthouse witnesses would help taxes insurance. know helped brother wife save lot insurance. Good, side fed kind afraid risk give disproportional standard life prevent tiny tiny risk. almost though think someone's going like fucking thanks China I'll take entire populations worth @ $x per vaccine research safety all. realized scrolling bad news every night, helped far bit. Somehow found wallowing ton every day. Stay home.

Let tell staying home. started Asia back January stayed home. came Mexico virus hadn’t hit yet, quickly came stayed home. I’ve staying home wearing mask since January. That’s 9 months counting. don’t tell stay home.

I’m already Baja, Mexico, since March, left La Paz July. 

IF November, 2 months now, things looking better there’s vaccination, go back La Paz stay months. Huge there. 

Now piss off. Screw near people, nothing good never came RDA Finland higher US due latitude? I'm saying people take US RDA around 600 IU call good, Finland need dietary sources US mean first all, 100% Woodstock cancelled. serious? Woodstock fucking disaster 

It's amazing see want see article like event rife founders managed avoid catastrophe, festival one spark away remembered much darker former bandmate Stu Cook called “one high points generation.” 

But summarize ""fucking disaster""?

Do think clubbing banned, sometimes people OD? January least Makes closing beaches, hiking trails, parks look even stupid now. Ah good time fall 🙃 same. single digits idea trials finished? guys clue science works. Yeah might get actual vaccine instead pirated bullshit that's probably improvement China without completed phase 3 can't say safe. Shit man, sorry hear that.😞 think missed point. 
These bad things. understand fake part. coffin know people every time need wear mask, keep forced distance causes alert times actually plan activities want exact minute even bother. things fun, restrictions fun. I'd rather take full risk fun (and risk super tiny). Fuck dude needs chillax, therapy joint. theatricality deception. powerful agents uninitiated. would need supplement time year? It’s supposed take much time sun make enough own. People listened still listening mask mandate that’s why. Shocking. Thank you, really appreciate info. Would fascinating see large scale trial particular area/city majority people given noodles fellow showing lack understanding probability. also literally went second NPC dialogue stated initial comment.

I'll repost I've already posted - nation 5 million individuals literal island domestic transmission again. nation 1.4 billion large geographic extent surrounded multiple different nations infections reporting 0 domestic transmission. say ""Yeah improbable, true"" naive. understand probability, simple. arguments connected. press freedom falls probability like population geographic extent does, well government control.

Also, love idea likely Chinese citizen telling know what's going China. hilariously ironic. seem understanding l'm saying - longer term trend, one data point one data point needs taken account numbers overall across time low.

The original comment related whether increase cases due increased testing genuine increase cases. reply present hard tell basis number hospitalizations deaths, number severe cases seem overall trending upwards time. I'm (l think) disagreeing saying pointing larger complex picture weekly averages fit into. want trust China health life call. Given intransparent start outbreak origins think mad trust them. Also habitual lying ubiquitous product piracy issues. 1980s propaganda: Communism leads rationing.

2020 reality...... death rates wasn’t it? Burn 5g towers?



/s 🙄 claim questioned was

It SEEMED, general, like questioning idea masks ineffective. Many say ""no proof this"" position ""anti-science"" position masks effective ""science"" opinion, backed first study says mechanistic studies show work

""Potentially"" important mechanistic studies support potential effect hand hygiene face masks, evidence 14 randomized controlled trials measures support substantial effect transmission laboratory-confirmed two sources aren’t particularly germane contradict other.

I agree one flu, anaccurate say contradict other.

And seem neglect study specifically google more. might get lucky time.

Why need one? ok clear, however, universal masking alone panacea. mask protect providers caring patient active Covid-19 it’s accompanied meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, gown. mask alone prevent health care workers early Covid-19 contaminating hands spreading virus patients colleagues. Focusing universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead transmission Covid-19 diverts attention implementing fundamental infection-control Neither surgical cotton masks effectively filtered SARS–CoV-2 coughs infected patients. Prior evidence surgical masks effectively filtered influenza virus (1) informed recommendations patients confirmed suspected COVID-19 wear face masks prevent transmission (2). However, size concentrations SARS–CoV-2 aerosols generated coughing unknown. Oberg Brousseau (3) demonstrated surgical masks exhibit adequate filter performance aerosols measuring 0.9, 2.0, 3.1 μm diameter.

The situation right basically ""We proof masks effective, probably dont hurt. lets aren’t proven true fundamental sense science. lots evidence masks work.

Then would *love* show evidence.

Go ahead try Google something. might get lucky. Sounds amazing wish country well. Icelandic person, I'm screwed. Wow yeah that's sound shitty. Something like would illegal sell here. however envy nature though especially covid started daily dose multivitamins beginning outbreak, articles started noting reduced impact. diet shit anyway figured couldnt hurt, whether get sick extra bonus.

Now, time eat spaghetti melt grated cheese cant arsed more. I'm talking today. Rhonda Patrick

Not gonna take Covid recommendation Joe Rogan places I’m surprised many people don’t get this. multiple replies thread talking 10 1000 good 100 10000. That’s makes positive rate important metric. low positive rate good indicator we’re enough testing catch almost cases. high positive rate indicates you’re testing really sick, thus test positive. Yea fuck people! 



/s unpredictable impact fetus. Noone wants accidentally create next thalidomide. used buy $1 piece. Yes pay $5 piece doesn’t mean can’t get them. supplier offered 7000 pieces 3M $5.50 buy 1200 pieces went eBay found model $3.50 bought another 600 there. yes it’s needed medical front line. lol funny address situation China all. Textbook whataboutism Hasn’t recent uptick numbers mostly linked Millinocket wedding? thought almost attended Mainers state. Ayy january depression buddies. got laid cool spent months crawling hole 😎 5 year old 2 year old well. It’s extremely hard friend. couldn’t imagine wife pregnant well.

Hang strong kid, make best decisions family ONE ELSE. That’s gotten this. survival mode. I’ve found like minded parents boat, really helps see kids play others (outdoors obviously) also commiserate parents young children. 

Just know you’re alone parent young children pandemic department. also know interested opinion pandemic feelings demographic point. Selfish? Yes. unless you’re situation one could understand it’s thought process need able cope. agree - I'm worried protecting individuals great certainty; idea reduce cases demographic level avoiding exponential growth and/or enabling R-number 1 shrink case numbers exponentially. Obviously continued masks, etc., must given.

If countries requiring recent negative PCR test, presumably could administer drug PCR test - within 48h window travel. Sure, generalise. commented specific case. wonder ... people constantly held state fear ... although little bit worry about. It’s like death rates doubled , tripled zombies walking around 

No, 10% average  completely missing point, maybe explaining well enough.

The larger problem politics either party (although GOP politics problematic). problem way America's politicians shift responsibility solving problems. Instead decisive, pass responsibility multiple levels government avoid scrutiny. constituents frustrated this, politicians simply demonize opposite party. slows democracy increases divide parties. 

Just look US coronavirus response want example. US wasted months federal government left lockdowns, mask requirements, PPE procurement states.

It absolutely one party this. believe that, viewing situation blinders. system survives state, definitely one party surviving. Honestly believe infection levels nowhere near high would need be. least Europe virus relatively quiet everywhere summer. One factor works Swedes banned going anywhere vacation that's cases come Austria example. God, know. 😖 I'm L.A. idiots going bring back us! enough? population 1.4Billion take years everyone thats including asian countries depend china. know everyone downvoted know meant. really believe chinas cases weren’t fabricated. Hong Kong, border war India, shut mouth can’t America shut fuck this? miss normalcy could possibly hide outbreak leadership, contained fast possible straight away pretty obvious what's going happen.

You contain deny. ignore virus itself. statistics argument stand up. 

You understand probability. nation 5 million individuals literal island domestic transmission again. nation 1.4 billion large geographic extent surrounded multiple different nations infections reporting 0 domestic transmission. say ""Yeah improbable, true"" naive. understand probability, simple. arguments connected. press freedom falls probability like population geographic extent does, well government far important democracy.

this sad, may get taken news there, stopping it. I'm sure personally seen lots news China wish could suppressed, guess work it.

But is. live one party state restrictions continued get worse technology control increased. Support government time high nationalism. got point, guess I'm going tell fuck off.

Because understand argument, difficult get point across. I've repeated things multiple times failed understand them. continue downplay extent internet censorship.

Once again, throughout this, recognize can't even admit likely domestic transmission ongoing China reported. sky falling. mass graves dug speak. may dozens hundreds cases reported day.

It's sad, really. quite likely. shit. country doesn’t care ppl siding white supremacy majority population either super guillible uneducated lot education country’s history hidden taught us . 

Plus ppl give fuck pandemic thousands dying every day 

So yeah ... I’ve dosage clinical depression LOT past 6 months Mark McGowan done stellar job Also want run lots different ethnic groups, different diets lifestyles. ok China says masks work. yet said believe it.

so fuck yourself, saying. imagine mature countries go waves - Country orders lockdown, gets control, eases up.

America said fuck it, many us STILL permanent quarantine parts. Difference is, never got reprieve. We're perma-fatigue mode. believe india's tests purely PCR. mix rapid tests known cause false negative positive. heard media echo chamber? media/people cite without checking source make seemingly universal message true. ""All news"", word ""propaganda""? I’m RN Chicagoland area. peak COVID outbreak things hectic. things (somewhat) stabilize, we’re long slow haul virus becomes ubiquitous enough herd immunity sets in. I’m frontliner, “corona nurse”. I’ve caring COVID patients since started Midwest still am. remember long ago people signs street calling hero. I’ve never whole life received much recognition praise carrying daily life (e.g. going work). would shower compliments accolades. found jarring harrowing tbh. consider hero healthcare workers call heroes self-centered idiots big boasting heads. Overnight, became something really special society sudden. RNs much side characters public pays attention healthcare (see TV shows like Grey’s Anatomy) sudden thing preventing world imploding. Recently, disinformation campaign reached full speed. got people around asking need wear masks, don’t “actually” work, masks lower oxygen levels, etc. Never difficulty stress related job hands public degree. people know physicians RNs wear several hours end operating room? let’s even get started crazy things going besides COVID like election coming rapid dangerous political polarization occurring US. Anyways, sorry long post don’t even know feel really. guess feel frustrated burnt people virtue signal words nothing actually bring affect real support. hated extra attention beginning felt disingenuous hate everyone’s return indifference too. mind body autopilot I’m watching days life pass like movie. It’s like while. alive want continue alive *feel* alive? want alive again...

(TL;DR: sad boi corona nurse hours ) mean obviously relaxation lockdown restrictions happened early August. look graph see restrictions started getting lifted. one local case Thailand, 100 days. still wear masks public even now. never really outbreak here. Noticed quite parties due holiday weekend. take dog walk every day, loud parties happening like hadn’t heard since quarantine started. One sounded like high school choir singing along Blink-182, another loud karaoke sound system running people singing. Lol clearly know fuck whats actually going china I'm glad recovered. Keep D, remember antibodies last contract Covid again, stay safe. Oops bad Helped lot tbh. Shit got unbearable went seek help. Never felt great life rn. Wish I'd gone sooner. Good. Chinese endured enough is. Let use vaccine likely work ready/prepared weeks/months already. creation vaccine, trials shit go go worldwide takes longest time. world gone insane ... sell weapons left-and-right ... weapons end lives dozens people want put medication/vaccination hold months potential side-effects? may be, still breathtaking lot people. wait till hit puberty realize covid lasting ""male genital ""You honestly think rationale behind wanting next Wuhan Xi upset truthful? No, need hide better.""

But possible. could possibly hide outbreak leadership, contained fast possible straight away pretty obvious what's going happen. Common sense surely tells unless contact tracing goes effect within time got outbreak impossible hide. contact tracing goes effect everyone knows.

No, I'm American. I'm English. statistics argument stand up. China clear virus they've new outbreaks, probably according statistics. mean can't control again. means new Zealand get control again. Yes, statistically likely infections, mean right now.

I'm pretty sure stated China terrible press freedoms, one thing wish free press, far important democracy. Although obviously wish American press country. point still stands, internet tightly controlled think, information still flows. may get taken news there, stopping it. I'm sure personally seen lots news China wish could suppressed, guess work it.

""I'm sorry covered schooling.""

Yeah got point, guess I'm going tell fuck off. basically Polymere Chain Reaction reagents, used basically everywhere work DNA.

Except key component PCR kit cannot generic. Specifically, PCR primers (that would expect included test kit) provide specificity pathogen X target DNA sequence. 

&amp;#x200B;

So either (i) really bad database, (ii) SARS-nCoV2 viral genome pathophysiolgy covid-19 characterized back 2017 confirm pandemic organized. Implications (i) boring I'd put money there. Damn. Tragic. I’m really confused beaches opened. Malecon also open now? Stay safe! Also: Quebec government fails keep list schools outbreaks accurate crowd source data, uses official government/school noticeds fact-check cases. probably catch anyway. question lead asymptomatic/mild cases usual.

If believe study, reduces severity disease, fewer people graduate symptomatic. also reduces transmission. way two already known related - asymptomatic less infectious compared severe patient coughing, spitting aerosolizing nasal fluids. Yeah, that’s seems be. So, 1% estimated mortality. 200,000 dead. Let’s say, conservatively, 5-10% hospitalized, case asymptomatic could way expected. least 50% expected see long-term problems... You’re looking least 1,000,000 counting expected suffer long-term effects virus. Failing hard beginning literally everything else seen improvement also dog tactic. Dude I'm largest metro area country that's hit heaviest covid. drop cases within weeks instituting mandatory social distancing mask related policies rest country lol hopeless situation pull even uneven distribution spikes/drops number cases. eventually trend downward   1918, swine flu, bird flu, 1960s, ... H1N1 H3N2 used part annual flu vaccine.  good time smaller family wedding.

My friends get married lockdown home small celebration. sent us videos pictures.

Honestly, large weddings overrated waste money. depends almost entirely state. I'm CO free unless specifically private insurance covers it. thank Senator bit. think PC term days ""hero"" too. Finally started come shell become social, boom right back started. There's way 31% herd immunity unless immunity like 70% urban areas less outlying areas averages 31%  Um...yeah? Yard saying sub is, actual reason? hurt feelings facts. hope you’re happy MMR vaccine prevalence pretty good it? effective, would many infections? issue cylindrical government flagrantly lied basic facts years \[Not really FDA, were, fed\] really little idea cost *actively happens* year off.

The reason I'm less hesitant vs earlier actually *getting* vaccine thousands people go even get vaccine year we'll know definitively helpful harmful. things like cost talked extensively actually becomes available real reason believe flagrantly, abhorrently expensive given every single basic medicine US flagrantly, abhorrently expensive. feel like I'm coping better covid I'm familiar anxiety depression. I've mentally preparing worst case scenario whole adult life.  weird, flu shots free regardless whether insurance COVID-BLUE 
Straight nuts Great use words, there. Lmao QUEREMOS SER VALENZUELA right go. masks?
About masks.
About “masks” can’t eat wedding cake mask. cannot make toast mask. Masks mostly bs.  would vaccine completely different set diseases work COVID-19? 3 million People did. electoral college fucked us ass. feel you. hope us grow support Green New deal supporters. Seems Justice Democrats back best candidates along lines. get fired Sunrise movement actions. Look em up. primarily 35 yr olds branch 35 plus crowd. That's me. Stay strong! need people like woke enraged. *tend self segregate*

They shop groceries get gas, etc?

I'm trying snarky google ISU IWU Bloomington / Normal Illinois. I'm dealing with. 

It's college population exposed. Yes largest section right people ages spilling communities surround B/N. Lol. grandparents go overseas fight country years can't go 8 months without seeing someone's mouth.  I’m sorry hear that. Fortunately we’ve alright although it’s definitely awful physical contact used multiple times week. Ugh. Hope country gets shit together I’m holding breath me, it’s governmental response, well humans value others. Unless like 20 people less social distanced, delayed States immunization clinics might cheaper. know Maine free catch clinics get 18 younger people back schedule school. Hopefully states expanding give free least reduced cost shots too.

Vaccines . gov links find places give vaccines. Go way get links state find vaccine clinics low income underinsured Ooooooh “I’m 14 edgy blaming everything liberals.”

Go ask mom make Bagel Bites. Save conversation adults. Severely strict ass lmao listen NPR guy Market Watch hour segment constantly specify well stock market actual effect general public half people even stake stock market 10% sizeable stake it, ergo means basically nothing. Politicians though talk stock market like means anything general public, that's paid support people tax cuts happened personally mind indoors, online classes get I’m dramatic that. pretend there’s invisible force field get close, fly back/jump away there’s bubble repelling me,

Usually get point  me? exactly everything I've feeling. hate everywhere bothering anything. I've stop following many subreddits can't stand seeing everyone wish ill onto others.. care others. hurts much anything else. dont want give human race right hard hope. 

I'm happy know there's least one person world feels similarly feel. alone. thing try best spread love acceptance, though hard.

I think Osho... says hate provokes hate. Love, earth paradise. ... love words. think they're important. They've least brought clarity ease mind.

Stay strong. you, friend.  pandemic killed hope ever seeing first contact, even basic space travel lifetime. reusable surgical mask? I'm uhh... ""super"" sweater.  Crazy, Bristol vast majority people wear mask shops. People relatively conscious social distancing shops/confined spaces - though admit yesterday noticed people definitely seemed let guard bit. ongoing years, taxpayer dollars siphoned corporate welfare ends pockets billionaires versus dedicated healthcare even sure understand could affect someone else's life. think themselves. someone graduating semester, man don’t really know university handle ceremony aspects (it postponed December). year graduates, recent soon-to-be, tough. Damn knew shld moved like 5 years ago! Uuuuh every year? Flu shots area \*FREE insurance covers it. insurance need check following boxes:

* working 40 hour week job GET plan.
* Pay paycheck set amount week / month afford insurance, lowers total pay bucks \[I.E. husband decent insurance paying one two dollars pocket per week, meaning goes 12.50, minimum wage, 10.50\]
* public plan exists cover dental, vision shots ""Necessary."" Basically meaning covers next nothing, bit depends state.

So state 18 would get vaccine free, flu shot every year, since I'm husband plan dependent pay shots. flu alone kills hundreds people year part ""Why"" one wants spend money get shot, included. also assuming state *actually expanded* ACA done extent needed, unlikely covered unless working 40 hour week job basically none market currently paying cash paycheck.

Next ask much standard, counter, life saving medicine costs, *boy that's bigger trip.* Well, costco home hardware also sell Canada. Google redlfagdeals. Canadian deal forum. Lot threads masks.  Highlights

* MMR vaccine given safely hundreds millions people around world since approved nearly 50 years ago, successfully reduced incidence measles, mumps rubella worldwide. 
* reason MMR vaccine may effective similarities weakened viruses vaccine SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19. viruses similar proteins surfaces involved infecting cells body, researchers think antibodies made response MMR vaccine also may recognize fight SARS-CoV-2 virus.
* Vaccine may strengthen immune response viral infections; trial enroll 30,000 health-care workers I’ve working home full time half decade used love it, back outside world enjoy. Same, NY still ration n95s. much ng peek covid use one weeks, still limited one per shift, signed another staff member charge supply. Without dismissing terrible effects well issues...

It’s basically issue. rogue state breaking international human rights trying cover propaganda suppression population. 
It’s obvious feed Chinese propaganda day, every day.  look much recent history, like current administration disbanded pandemic response team (established prior 'left' admin) president's son-in-law left responsible procurement PPE turned offer company insider US start ramping production, despite multiple intel warnings COVID bad initially suspected? Yeah same. Fuck Target, fuck Walmart fuck every corporation continually refuses treat us like people. get downvoted hell, frank enough NYC reached forms herd immunity, cause moment someone hears words, imagine ..70% (or whatever number, scientists UK talking about)..and way us reach numbers etc.

My reasoning simpler,..that stabilizing NYC simple combination herd immunity + masks + lockdown. yes, even though 70% absolute/total population may reached it..a good chunk people moving reached levels immunity, masks certainly helping lockdown.. 

Anybody remember stuff around ""flatten curve""..that about..that slow spread Covid extent manage better, better medications, heck slow ..till vaccine would best..

Good bad, immunity (herd vaccine-based) eventually going protect us 100% till get there... manage things (masks, lockdown non-essential stuff)... Labor Day weekend like, hold beer! time, didn’t much information happens get it, knew bad. 

And whole ‘Jesus protect us’ ‘it’s god’s will’, ugh. Great way avoid responsibility distance thinking. gross.  Throwing people jail??? Que te fumaste? country needs people like willing sacrifice.

P TIL Botswana, Costa Rica, Uruguay, South Korea white people countries, Russia Poland not.  ((((Hugs)))) confirm personally. Got married August. 125 people, indoors. strict rules still great time. Zero cases month later - goes show done, must implement common sense rules! Also, masks social distancing still work case people haven’t heard! glad chose homeschool kids year. I'm hoping names people published... punishment deterrent future weddings. What's done done, wedding, serve warning others thing (blatantly ignoring rules and/or throwing away precautions).

Which I'm happy cheering colleges taking stern measures students flout social distancing measures Facebook 10 years keep friends family disable month ago could stand seeing many people love respected proud ignorant. facts would sway them. pandemic bad enough discover true selves many thought knew debilitating.  Terrible news. Based article really look like going get better either:

""On day India surpassed Brazil’s infection tally, country’s largest metro system capital New Delhi began operating again, limited religious sporting events allowed restart bars set open."" Keep head up! Good things come way! difference virus, don’t heavily restrict everybody’s lives “beat” it. Also, difference “winning”, losing less. People act like fucking game control everybody like pawns win match, that’s fucking virus works. lost day jumped humans. might well make world worse it’s that's also think people realizing. truly believe even quarter people surveyed already depressed before. issue knowing it, distractions place (hobbies, working, family, friends, etc), may entirely notice. 

Not best example, here. definitely anxiety pandemic. Never formally diagnosed, even stranger could tell. notice *bad* gotten since everything took place. 

My risk individual, go generally everything. mind, long prevent sort chance getting it, I'm willing. also means we've making meals expose sort possibility. 

However, come one afternoon, asked wanted simply try mcdonald's. to, understood sentiment us hungry eating morning wanting cook, agreed. 

I also cannot even begin describe feelings had. put gloves mask on, speak unless needed like ""thank you"", even precautions place, tears practically majority it. 

I never way before, was. Debilitating anxiety simply ordering fast food meal....I promptly passed eating lol yes, there's roughly 1 death per day covid, less deaths flu previous years due restrictions increased hygiene awareness, balances out. essentially admitted whole family ""yo we're horny af let's thing QUICK"" something wildly uncomfortable.

Not good comparison me.  Michigan well. [First need three shots, Every country eradicated virus completely shut borders is, every country. numbers stay low people follow instructions avoid e.g. packed restaurants. hot garbage. It’s time weigh God-given rights false sense “safety”. solely responsible protection actions. mask won’t protect you. I’d rather die standing live kneeling mob. needs stop.

It’s scary people think way Right, thought might go route, commonly argued there's umbilical cord, baby mother's body.

These 2 totally different arguments though, let's stay covid one.

If knowingly walk workplace, business, etc, symptoms pandemic level disease &amp; wear mask inform anyone around situation, total piece shit. First time? infact wearing mask, issue. allowed take mask either. Spraying something mouth sucking candy alter moisture mouth change temperature causes bacteria thrive. I'll take scientific method gut feelings day week. I'm surprised. live Minnesota even though Governor's Order around mask requirements, many businesses/people still go around mask-less.

Honestly, it’s nothing like see reddit. live northeast (basically initial epicenter) people aren’t really worried much Covid anymore. People still wear masks everything indoors. hospitals completely fine. teachers WANT go back school teaching remotely difficult. schools back person. pretty bad 2 months hospitals coming close capacity initial spike happened. apart school, indoor dining, bars, wear masks, everything mostly back normal. lot people still working home though too. people realized initial hysteria exactly that, hysteria. Big weddings ridiculous waste money young couple could put way better use invite 150 people get gravy bowl use twice.  lot states pretty good leadership curb virus usa. I'm thankful fact live one states fly Southeast Southwest US. doubt popular Midwest Northeast. That's problem *popularity*. pleasant experience dining wearing heavy clothing freezing snowstorm. can't picture people would want go date business meeting like that.

I personally think indoor dining come back winter cold areas. Restaurants can't stay closed March, can't recover that. I’m fortunate situation. I’ve lived pretty abusive people I’m first time life. used severe depression, I’m independent, I’m good. Isolating people helped, isn’t shit kind funny? 

There’s definitely people want see know. 

Although.. true almost everyone know really tough time pandemic severe OCD. worst time. Well ordering online would safer route .. Honest PPE Supply online box. Well stated~ N95, mean KN95? often confused. they're serious perpetuating pandemic, get married priest / pastor governmental clerk, therefore marriage legal front church government. party / celebration held later pandemic over. ceremony small 6 ppl (the couple + 2 sets parents, maybe witnesses). 

Of course venue might kind refund policies etc might complicating factor. Sounds like nightmare. Fight back rights taken permanently ""Lack end sight""

THAT largest part depression... numbers would start going .... like higher go people party. crazy.

The defeatist attitude can't get together boggles me. 

We 4.3 precent world population quarter covid deaths. That's deeply embarrassing.

The side us respecting enough wait out. get side I'd like death possible. 

If willing part solution part problem. American right? Every goal achievable together.

So settle defeatist look? sTOp sAd That's great hear! feel everyone also nice hear good news &amp; time flies glad getting extra moments!!! average American won’t listen people educated. Every Fucking thing world available them, I’ll get info cousin Facebook, stranger reddit ftm Dude....I’ve pretty fucking shitty mental states. Full nervous breakdown. years time. least 15 different meds last 20 years. Probably many doctors therapists. honestly...what making progress comes getting pissed isn’t working willing TRY SOMETHING NEW. 

You said medication isn’t anymore. Well, it’s time take little bit help meds give start TRYING SOMETHING NEW. willing accept maybe “bullshit” isn’t fucking hippy crap you’ve always told is. Maybe drinking water actually make feel better. Maybe getting shape uncomfortable TIME help feel better. Maybe change fucked thought patterns I’ve addicted years. 

Self care complicated. requires learn yourself. doctor doesn’t know fuck you. spend time waiter restaurant doctor. make best guess based situation. it’s personal responsibility learn much situation possible. It’s way begin learn REALLY going on. mindfulness “bullshit” comes in. It’s hard. takes LOT time level self honesty people choose allow get to. 

But WORKS. alternative treatments. There’s damn good reason stuff around hundreds, thousands, years. People don’t keep things doesn’t sort tangible benefit them. hell man, even bullshit. really “tricking yourself”’into happy. ends happy....are seriously going allow enjoy isn’t “real”? 

Meds doctors tools. need lot two tools complicated job. mental disasters need every tool even hope getting job done. 

I wish luck man. time? 

Also, sorry. 


Fuckin', either. Hang there, scary recoverable. somehow pit years.

rest much can, positive long term shit (jog, sit park, walk, learn craft), eat healthy Living decent sized city, border another large city Iowa really sucks. get bunch idiots Iowa spread shit like wildfire. guarantee Got link - nationwide, rather north-east? It'd great news true. effects COVID-19 TOP reality world crashing people. constant distractions divert attention away shit hole world always been. we're losing jobs rich getting even unimaginablely rich. celebrities touch expected sympathy stuck mansions worry world quickly told shut fuck HR team cause one relate. Athletes mad cause take pay cut laughable considering they're probably still making fuck load us.

What depresses going change nothing over. People go back worshipping celebrities athletes distract mundane economically enslaved lives. finally understand monarchs centuries ago got away much shit now. Depends skin tone, well absorb vitamin d, etc

It's like asking ""if drink water daily eat watermelon enough drink?"" True, want apple apple comparison. 

But replied comment “NYC probably blew Italy months ago.” sure vote brigading pro-China bots uninformed people 🤔 Ah politics Thanks that! thats whyi left usa

i live vietnam now

think every bad thing usa...vietnam opposite

be well late kind nature outbreak? ebb flow currently, Covid-19 therefore declining 28 states?

But tell, seems affected northern coastal states hard, California, declined measures took effect, broken south returned California, slowly moving inland distancing measures relaxed and/or fatigue kicks cases low (but course, zero close it). straight scene Matrix. Humans become virus. plenty research saying make difference. 

This clinical trial overrides types research observational etc. 76 excess deaths per 100k 2020 far.  202 May. 

Here compare apples oranges.

You would need compare NYC Milano Bergamo, whole country Italys. kick groin may required overcome this. Home curbside delivery? Germany probably among countries closest Sweden terms strategy. People lot freedom movement still economy affected rest Europe. us worked partially took action earlier pandemic timeline vs. Latin countries partially cultural differences. Spain holidays week ago, unfortunately soft lockdown like would simply work due family orientated daily life is. someone ready endanger life benefit, would assume deserve called friend. Can't become depressed already depressed.

I mild untreated depression pandemic probably positive mental health overall. I'm right physical stuff. I've sleeping much, forcing bed fall asleep couch hour later. instead forcing get up, decided let body decide wake today. slept 16 hours. Dr says there's nothing wrong already know sometimes really feels like I'm dying.  People always bang increase suicides numbers changed slightest. 
Unconditional government financial support made difference guess. people literally better - they're less stressed. *nurses* Minnesota lucky charge nurses charge distributing masks, take care first. 


They refuse give N95, I've spend 2 hours time room patients confirmed COVID surgical mask/face shield. 


If could 1 N95 per month would happy. confirm. Anxiety extra layer shouldn’t point exactly, glad taught something. lung damage still covid fucking March ffs. Pulmonologist fucking useless, too, unfortunately. Cool man , love balkans ! agree America fucked hahah 😂 holidays pretty much going suck. Lol I’ve explain doctors agoraphobia set around late December, saying (in June) hadn’t house 5 times six months; didn’t realize *how* bad was. 

Like ... like mental illness became like.. perk. also legitimized pretty toxic way. Lol Bold believe someone stupid enough expose lot unmasked people would enough assets cover said liabilities. Fair enough. kids starting back fairly late year Depends.

There'll Trump-loving conspiracy theorists praise inventing first ever, safe vaccine. There'll conspiracy theorists sides spectrum doubt vaccine even approved international bodies long-established scientists US.

And there'll bots pushing sides argument online once. Well look sadness hipster, dreams crushed could even crushed. Kidding, I’m sad single chronic depression person Yeah still eat out, takeout delivery. Wipe groceries down. seen friends it’s always one friend time always stay away people. people I’ve seen also taking seriously well. going Dr.'s office risk right now... US also developing vaccines distributed free citizens Senegal, set good example us learn from. live small city people angry wear mask busy public places many wear mask.. Masks work, who'd thunk it? Nice try bud right that's charge horror show. Lol u upset? TIL Australia less population Tokyo metro area Remember research saying made difference before. anybody update what’s happened since? perhaps england? parts schools open week already guess take account death rates initial phase epidemic. 

What they're suggesting (not necessarily agree) risk dying, epidemic returns full strength, higher NZ, extent increased risk death per case makes massively lower case numbers. person lives Hamptons weird still seeing wealthy still here. Unfortunately me, deal assholes whole year. Ugh... Yeah honestly, methodology seems extremely flawed. Asymptomatic case here. VO2 Max dropped 39 45.

Two months later got VO2 max back 45 May actually better wear sunscreen limit exposure, duration depend skin type. works best 10 minutes unprotected sun covering sunscreen. got covid march able find work sense lost job then. I've gained weight permanent lung damage can't workout anymore. Everything begun hurt time keep sweating randomly I'm stressed depressed time. day caught thinking easy it'd go hardware store buy bricks, fill backpack, lock straps chest padlock jump bridge near apartment. 


IDK wtf going antidepressant seem helping much anymore Schools opening week uk Hi two week old account posts free karma .. Wait holidays. hate bad news bad worst case scenarios even though may likely outcome... 
Stupid ass we're managing* Covid pretty well.

*As long count healthcare aged care systems. talk time. outdoors. quantifiable virus spread it. hearing it, right? That's can't trace protests. think I’ve already anyways Sunshine maybe? I'm boat. Moved new city, friends, family recently single 8 year relationship. I'm terribly miserable, lonely constantly thinking her. can't think, eat bring anything except distract work. Covid makes even worse since cannot even try meet new friends , productive new home since cannot buy basic weights. feel lost, depressed never ending loop trying come reality relationship over. I've read lot ""how to's"" break ups males, they're mostly centralized social productive. hard time there's much restriction. Bangladesh low fatalities, people hardly wear masks. one populous countries world. Seems like herd immunity called acting like dumb HS kid making people butt jokes. Insensitive jokes like lead bullying. France testing 1 million people week, level US per capita basis 4.2 million, case anyone wondering. think term you’re looking materialism. Money around long written history integral part civilization beyond hunter gatherers. Stuff like needs press Worth pointing that, 25 million confirmed infections (and many times that, unconfirmed), 662 cases worldwide.

Even say that, including developing world, 1 32 globe infected, would 20,000 cases everyone got Covid-19 stage lives.

Obviously that's horrible illness, 1 100,000 shot. That's surprising. one guy, yeah, risk factors probably increased risk death potentially even 5%, probably less. 

For 60-year olds died, yes, age far biggest risk factor. problem selection bias - observe 60-year olds get it, notice ones die. healthy people 60s, risk probably range 2%. got unlucky, 98% got better. 

Our brains great probability. tend extrapolate risk factors sure things ignore things immediately observable. India, we're almost close become number one nation no.of cases. concrete plans Indian Govt. procurement, supply-chain distribution vaccines. certainly know better express grief anguish lack preparation honorable Indian Govt. fines get wearing mask there? good news indeed, role vitamin getting quite solid point think. Keeping Vitamin normal levels making sure significant deficiency probably best way keep people ICU right now.

If safely without getting infected, really good idea check vitamin levels, especially older people. packing said N95 them. Reminds French cartoon blood cells white cells vacuuming viruses. :) When's new AoT season happening again? 

Completly forgot happening.  want antibody test right -- worried becoming sick? whether already covid past (which antibody test tells you)? test want PCR nasal swab test. hoping keep social distancing years come freaks? breath fresh air compared usual doom gloomers, hoping stay miserable years come. Exactly. know places focussing disinfecting tables requiring use hand sanitizer upon entry, reality airborne virus. someone COVID coughs sneezes (without covering mouth) eating food happen breathe in, you’re exposed. 

Increased cleaning isn’t helpful imo. risk still high restaurants pack people in. Evidence lung damage CT 50% participants 3 months post infection.  know thread helping depression know I'm alone, making depression worse see many stories depression. feel you. quit job restaurant. don’t plan b mentally couldn’t take anymore. found angry time couldn’t allow like time Thanks much edited add portion post! I’m large family (direct extended) pretty much loan ranger still maintaining extremely militant mitigation protocols since March. think helps I’m science nerd healthcare followed severity COVID China right New Year celebrations. saw videos people collapsing streets dying knew gut would soon way serious people wanted admit still aren’t admitting. 

I basically got several arguments siblings family members grown fatigued (which entirely disappointing say like militant well), mentally think they’re spent. I’m like saying “we’ve made FAR endure this, give now?” even one siblings say, “if it’s year change protect family entire family it;” now, kids back person learning, asking immunocompromised relative help watch kids post school work. sibling lasted NYC family entire pandemic, taps relocated Florida next two months places two weeks ago “had get apartment bc they’re depressed.” 

It entirely discouraging times noted know they’re thinking I’m lunatic militant still, don’t want thing don’t want responsible giving anyone else. don’t want life someone else hands couldn’t mentally tough selfless. people even said back I’ve said “well would get family member sick heart health immune issues already end alone, hospitalized worse die selfish behavior?,” they’re reply simply, “yes, would happens?” contact tracing joke one could pin them. Ugh sucks. It’s tearing nation families apart proper protocol shouldn’t controversial. 

Thanks coming Ted Talk. normal covid sub? one doom gloom, one denial picking studies fit agenda downplaying it. Again, I'm one trying prove point. I'm one claiming NYC reaching herd immunity. I'm one cherry picking preprints peer reviewed try prove know I'm talking even though initial statement herd immunity kinda makes impossible credibility since stupid thing claim. Already 42+ school shut two weeks. Great start vaccines take years limited funding, difficulties participant recruitment difficulty ascertaining efficacy due low community spread target disease.

Additionally, candidates like oxford vaccine development years originally intended MERS. mers burnt lost resources completion can't true time

1) China made virus, make vaccine give world free

2) Never trust made China vaccine gonna kill probably types people can't stand militant vegetarians tell uncertain terms stop eating meat. Shelter food necessary survival. argue money made competition better made trade easier, necessary survival.

Why make drunk driving legal state care kill others   people buy vitamin supplements nothing, like seeing fat people shop Trader Joe’s Whole Foods. Go back Walmart don't, that's asked. thank god one speaks German could evil man... mortality, 2 patients control group died; patients vitamin group died. enough deaths make results statistically significant. hospitalized patients don’t usually die Covid-19, unless ICU. 

Not true Ireland, 3,412 COVID-19 patients admitted hospital 1,519 died, 447 moved ICU. statistics omit ICU fatality numbers, donlt know proportion ICU died.

We rarely moved people years kids admitted, condition hearts could rest lives? already detecting athletes, people never fully recover. fuckin thanks. Chest pain also caused acid reflux (even getting regular heartburn symptoms) turn caused chronic stress often goes hand hand depression. saying related derby, protesters crowds, wonder contributed? *sweats Joe Rogan* almost like it’s increasingly obvious it’s meme virus Linus Pauling Institute recommends 2000 IU daily. think that’s reasonable.

Ug, feel sunburn thing. fell asleep beach umbrella sunscreen *still* got sun poisoning. Political leaders raising ‘false hopes’ everything

How else could politics cannot keep giving false hope issues. plenty states well 10% 1% something brag about.  It’s funny another post references study, Guardians headline patients recover. Fucking Guardian trash. many people *dying* though?

I mean .. false positives reality.

Even *zero* actual cases Covid, would still reporting positive cases day.

Is kind mechanism account this?  use visit family Scotland, packed range clothes sweats shorts tank tops. Never knew pack summer. tfw prescribed 25k IU doc hahaha right. Thanks pointing effect big enough, need large sample size.

Only purely interested achieving statistical significance within limited selected population.

We know groups study highly unbalanced baseline. know data BMI, medications, number factors. [Small trials already incorrect ~75% without introducing baseline bias. chances outcome happening pure chance astronomically small.

That's true *within population*. genuinely believe vitamin D, 1000-person, truly randomized, generalizable population, generate 0.03? vitamin literally miracle cure COVID? [The latest mendelian randomization strongly suggest previous observational associations vit outcomes result confounding. Possibly antibodies wane quite fast sure, Sweden far away herd immunity all. “Yeah, good time. picture health care 2irkers carrying body man crematorium, iss unreal. it’s someone knows stuff words coming mouth Joe’s... plus always research, NIH study whatnot backs I’m usually board. think way many people don’t research. podcast definitely isn’t go-to vital info respect still informative right guests. guys think universities US close point again? elected stay home freshman year college take online courses local community, instead going university. university going attend 9 cases 17,000 tests among 3-week period. I’m wondering made wrong choice staying home year. know joke (and made well time) lot conspiracy fans reddit, information want clarify: negative deaths corrections region Skåne noticed FHM reports included deaths region earlier actually fit criteria reporting (death within 30 days positive COVID-19 test). 

Now summer holidays regions municipalities starting analyze dig deeper records (medical otherwise) interesting see corrections. example, Östergötland uneven reporting throughout summer (no reports month, reports 20 once, course proper older dates, almost reports another month reports 10 once) good know another region similar issues too. lol planet u living small town India people wear masks maintain social distance. lot covid cases. positive test result ratio high. probably many times covid positive official numbers due insufficient test. Yet covid cases asymptomatic. Serious illness due covid rare. two deaths though (which recorded covid deaths authorities obvious reasons). fake news? look find 10000IU supplements online. 6% still hundreds thousands people, ashamed shrugging like nothing, hope 6% anti-maskers. misunderstood me. I'm saying case fatality rate (deaths / cases) accurately measuring cases. lot cases finding, people severe symptoms going go get tested end hospital. Brad asymptomatic little symptoms recovered never showed here. clinical trial observational study. Morocco.

I've seen 500-1000ui recommended IMO benefits noticeable, ideally aim 5000 - 10,000 per day. feel like taking everyday take 50,000 every week so, never noticed anything off, night taking notice sleep lot better. long eat leafy greens take Vitamin K, make sure get enough calcium risk OD. It’s political message targets stupid people’s belief system touts trust Americans use common sense right thing, individualism core. It’s deliberate attack science making people think alone. ""The prosperous economy, richer bottom 20%,"" Conard said. ""And depending almost exclusively government redistribution income. get income from? get increasing overall prosperity economy. best measure Jeff Bezos' salary.""

That's one (wrong) way see it

The way Amazon freeloaded government infrastructure corporations large freeload investments government like public education even protection like military. taxes systemically low far long. Saying bottom 20% ""depend exclusively government redistribution"" offensive also wrong unless call roads mail manner services provided corporations ""government redistribution"". bet would business without it. haves depend much government redistribution like admit pumping ""whole economy"" make sense share inequitable.

Even take programs like food stamps direct cash payments nowhere near 20% ""welfare queen"" BS disguised reasonableness. ""Uplifting inequality"" ass. Fuck corporate welfare. one study growing pile evidence pointing Vitamin D. It’s obviously small absolute proof- governments could easily recommend taking day without harm general population potentially saving millions lives. really seems like no-brainer.  think 3 month results done time next visit 12 weeks discharge, symptoms improved lung damage reduced 56%. *At stage, early results evaluations 24 weeks.* seriously passes news? gives flying fuck. What? How?? mind asking went wrong? brides influence? children like this? vaccinate risk I’d happy that! forget winter's coming, holidays, less sun light, lot people still jobs. gonna get lot worse. There'll Trump-loving conspiracy theorists praise inventing first ever, safe vaccine. 

You already see narrative shift too. 300IQ posters claiming dangerous also demanding FDA rush trump vaccine. dangerous need rushed? tried smoking shit ton weed? “Quarantine day 4 testing positive | Iron Lung Haul” live New Mexico, USA- endocrinologist prescribes it, bc know monitor / follow usually detected evaluating another endocrine issue. mods need get high horse stop removing responses. absolutely demonstrated big part problem. Ah, explains negative death counts days ago. still know zombie people spread disease more, wait two weeks (or 10 years 10 days). Can’t argue that. haven’t shut unhealthy options make everyone eat soylent cubes? previous comment removed go detail - think lot depend forcefully endorses it. source message important content. found many type 2 diabetics trouble absorbing vitamin D, tend low levels. take 5000iu daily, I'm still low side normal. type 2 pre-diabetic, might want get levels checked take extra needed. least 50% expected see long-term problems...

Except percent showing damage improved significantly 6 weeks, 12 weeks. 24 weeks testing hasnt done yet.

12 weeks 3 months. typical still experiencing effects bad viral infection 3 months.

So I'm sure make estimate ""permanent damage"" this. so, please Joe bunch cranks pod times. Sure good guess too. mainly entertainment. really gonna take medical advice conversation meat head roll dice week? Agreed! know different people say different things? They're one body making statements. believe Umeå's semester started last week - 31/8. week orientation week. idea get people tested first week semester (last week) week later (to see change). started Trump elected  currently take 4000 IU per day years monitoring blood levels, it’s kept range.

Trust doctor, random comment (not even mine). you’re worried, ask follow blood test see you’re responding current amount. I'm wondering chicken /egg scenario.
Better vitamin levels = lower covid incidence hospitalization spend time outdoors (getting exposed sun) &amp; better shape overall - vitamin alone keep hospital? isn’t cure - reduces severity disease. teaching, hell yes Actually, live 38th parrallel, winter months impossible body make Vit good radiation deflected atmosphere, due angle earth.

Stay safe, best luck cousin nuptials. trust Brazil? last checked (which admittedly days ago), vaccines trials 50% effective, good percentage people would like vet on. 50/50 great numbers game.


Unless inside info one trials way would know effective are. still tested announced trials. Ive said ill say again.

Water cannons filled ghost pepper sauce take care real quick. call protest? Thank JRE podcast informing three months ago. We're talking Canada. USA.


And cheap open cafe. hell vaccines free US? That's ridiculous Yep. doctor saw end level weeks nothing (and ending feeling chronic fatigue again) 34nm whatever. Said that's within normal range anything. Gave new allergy med try sent way. sinuses still terrible though. big part fatigue. I've done reading promising links vit body's inflammatory response. Since sinus issues helped lot anti inflammatory drugs hope high levels vit helped sinuses energy level time 50k vit D. Either way least safe dose maybe probably help. Chronic fatigue makes everyone around think lazy, breeds resentment home, makes focusing work hard... buncha bullshit. feel wasted 8 hours sleep (not overweight, sleep apnea). mindset exactly article addressed. said old way thinking current evidence showing effective strategy. vulnerable person gets vaccinated protecting isolation, ones spreading virus. vaccinate young social types really care following guidelines getting sick enough stay home, protect many people. question getting best bang buck limited vaccines available.

Damn right I’m FEARFUL COVID-19! pay cut well took away one tuition reimbursement bonuses. hazard pay worst it. ten doctors =ten recommendations say equivalent dense imbecile.

Has covid rotted last couple braincells, always struggled basic reading comprehension? 

You would think lockdown would time learn more, instead failing basics. Umm scientific literacy thread? study absolutely cannot used make conclusions. 

It used impetus larger, robust trial. That’s it. God HCQ 😪 Passing remark, Libya given much attention worrisome pattern lately. New cases steadily rising since mid-July, 500-600 cases per day last week today 1,000. might seem much, country less 7 million inhabitants, thousand cases per day like seeing 10,000 daily cases Italy/France/UK. unremarkable amount tests per capita. say need ton. trying say normal amount probably good anyone get lot sun. get levels tested still take vitamin probably deficient, dosage would never toxic levels.

The last part show amount get sun much smaller supposed get sun. People might think hour outdoors day enough, probably isn't, especially live far equator wear long clothes. Actually COVID MUTATES LIKE INFLUENZA B, slower influenza A. Check publications. Thanks info! Ya, I'm indoor dining either. I'm glad see ivermectin results reach mainstream. retrospective studies finding significantly helped severe cases, think main use could outpatient mild/asymptomatic cases. could potentially significantly reduce infected individuals ability transmit virus, may even stop growing severe. ton ongoing ivermectin trials,

“Everything moderation, including moderation.”

\-Oscar Wilde would assume vaccinate participants go in. You’re one spreading misinformation. Mild covid flu+pneumonia equivalent misinformed. 

You’re wrong saying evolutionary models say expect less deadly version the. Iris time that’s LONG-TERM view things. Viruses easily evolve spread lethal particularly spread concentrated symptoms arise...which virus appears able already. liver breaking compound. Good. Again, that's intentional. Low spread early means immunity population big factor study. They're comparing population time, they're encouraging people take test two weeks running. grand conspiracy here. live USA.

That's pretty obvious since clearly idea talking saying, comes D, everyone could use little more? earth would put people's selfish ignorant individual choices government? supposed follow social distancing, wear masks, stay home develop symptoms already, tested positive not.

Of course - they're *supposed* do. knowing positive test increase compliance, people rationalize away, importantly, neither boss work (or least, they're less likely to). taking 5000 IU daily years great. recently seeing comments dangers “too much” I’m also curious now! since it’s done nothing good believe it’s fine guess schools means test tuition can’t read article don’t feel like trying figure disable adblocker, based comments, sounds like petty clickbait Ask doc vitamin blood test. tell want know. Missing leg :( Religion disease itself. 0% chance put body Along everyone else. People crawling every square inch outdoor space like ants sandwich.

Good.  Sad part likely interested lot people. will, on, ingest zero dangerous, evil, lethal vitamin supplements!!!!! immortality, come!
yay!!! someone want take vaccine - take chances Covid. value life less vaccine, I. Fine.

But question trusting effectiveness vaccine - fact vaccine *will not* work proportion population. people (some know are) told personal ""choice"" isolate virus circulates numbers large today's. 

Unless get high vaccine uptake high effectiveness, would brilliant, need social distance somewhat (hopefully manageable way) short period time get case numbers down. many deaths. Nobody cares cases anymore Bangladesh low fatalities

Could low obesity high sunlight (hence high vitamin D). Hopefully low reporting. volunteering part climate change? wishing death others? knee problems gotten worse. used lot walking I've really dropped much. way! SURGE!!! mean 7 deaths month?!?!!

Interesting thing note: taking high dose vit C pee would smell acidic. sore throat stage stopped day 4 pee 'stopped' smelling acidic.

Viruses well known potentially cause complications, heart damage refer also happen flu. lung damage common complication pneumonia, typically resolve time.

Lockdown contra productive. explain happening NYC, Sweden places saw new cases dip drastically 20-25% seroprevalence reached. imply herd immunity reached long 60-70% estimates got March people still seem buy into?

We shouldn’t use herd immunity *right now* since looks like we’ll probably good vaccine place end year. Oxford, Pfizer Moderna shots fall short, believe choice explore herd option point. next vaccine candidates won’t evaluation end Q1 2021 best, world cannot stay shut 2021. would utter insanity, pandemic ever handled societal-destructive way (except maybe Black Death, 30-60% IFR).

1) results study really show getting larger amounts vitamin D? so, amounts really 5 10k IU range?

Actually, looking questions kind look like I'm asking medical advice much vitamin take. I'll definitely understand want answer. Thank time!

even say them, ingredients usually low quality/low bioavailability 

It’s better go specifics, good b complex won’t hurt you’ll low things like vitamin k, magnesium etc

you’re better going reputable vendor (for ex: nootropics depot) general trying look anything specific supplement specific brand 

nothing compares health benefits eating balanced diet veggie/fruit smoothies though, make fuckers taste delicious Yup did. Europe USA, spread much lower spring, shown lower amount deaths. Mitigation also contributed, weather variable play. Indeed, hardest hit parts world summer southern hemisphere - South America, South Africa, currently winter. clinical side dismissive vitamin trials would think. instance, evidence cocktail including vitamin C help septic patients ICU, primarily one PI led research caught broadly. believe IRB could reasonably convinced replication study prove benefit outside single center would worthwhile.  many variables make assumption including population health, quality health care population infected. Excess mortality say much herd immunity without exploring variables first. Facebook University? point utterly unremarkable. wasnt point intellegence could used trait. Take Vitamin Gummies. Ewwww.

At least willing admit faults. It’s fat soluble vitamin. Take food better absorption. Lmao. That's major projection I've ever seen some. ones cherry-picking data fit narrative herd immunitards like you. Covid Redux, Coming crowded theater near you. So, saying can't propose group nations make Sweden's performance look bad. Noted. agree principle - fuck changes behavior stranger internet does? reality, lot people do. idiots push ""hoax"" agenda, people listen. Almost countries world failed test competition compare Denmark. lol. slowed mitigation put place. skyrocketed mitigation. weather variable play. JOE ROGAN RIGHT?!?!? Exuse mods? article um, relevant personally? like, post many these? prefer content relevant personally thx also young population ""A couple studies"" suggest pretty much anything virus. 

Excess mortality Peru already NY, massively younger population. Still sign herd immunity... listen man.  Back spring, taking 5000iu couple months, caused constantly feeling urinate (a known side effect much).  quit month return feeling normal.  Trying 2000 now. go anywhere near 5000 again. People still adhering restrictions + summer weather slowing infections. course herd immunitards already hijacked comment section. go clouds forever, finally get peak start again. investing education suddenly stop giant propaganda machines blunt effeciency Maybe isn’t lot tourism travel 90% Africa It’s banned. travel EU like. mean cases come Austria? virus over, Sweden community spread since March. Stockholm probably herd immunity, it’s much wildspread think. Okay, population small already SMALL risk ICU one person one way another influences percentage HUGE amount.

Like explained before, surprise people given vitamins probably vitamin deficient poor health better off. already know poor health = worse health outcomes. That's good, important good friends laugh trying times. Many depressed people can't manage that, uber sadness hipster, may even ever experienced loneliness sadness all... Suffering good metric comparison. We've let perfect become enemy good (or useful) many times pandemic.

R(t) teetering around 1 states. something like rapid home testing drop 10-20% would huge.

It also would open whole bunch testing happening now- like testing guests hotel could deploy tests wherever significant number infections

Which really really driven wastewater testing. baffles still daily testing (and publically posting data) every wastewater facility US.  would tell need prioritize targeted testing (via rapid swabs pooled PCR) You’re confusing fearfulness prudence.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* true, part FIGHTING pandemic able predict coming act accordingly - particular, detecting potential increase spread cutting knees shutdowns restrictions.

This paramount importance covid nature creeping exponential spread. Several states (FL/TX/AZ/CA) made grave mistake June detecting acting early signs increasing spread. time made inescapably clear July, already far late, ink might well already dry tens thousands deaths month. 

They watching early indicators June, rising R0 values increase percent positives. would hope would learned lesson now, nation. course not. Risk needing ICU reduced 97% highly statistically significant p&lt;0.001. 

Its always nice big sample size effect size large enough evidence still compelling effect size huge. enough people died give 100% reduction death statistical significance. study N:1008 way might enough dead people: also lot research points sub run ccp. It’s pathetic reddit promotes sub hub accurate information. Sounds like boss dont disagree you, terrible thing say student. I'm sure student offended teacher could apologise.. rather lose job? teacher refused apologise even explaining student might offended, fair enough, someone step in.

I thought supposed become resilient puerile stuff adults, less. good news small study using outdated treatment protocols. 

The study size less 100 people. blind. People given vitamin favored trial 2:1. That's opposite blind. 

It's news Vitamins = Good. We've known that. also know unhealthy among populations fare worst Covid. further, surprise people need vitamins. 

This needs real study headlines like ones presented warranted.

Clickbait ruins science yet again. Probably better track recovery pfts cts though, owing risk ionizing radiation simply patient/clinically oriented outcome imaging.

Hopefully family recover well. think point sweat throw away. I'd also look polyester nylon ""breathable"" masks, like get workout gear. you’re incredibly selfish. 
i live nyc, holed march severity virus. upset vacation livelihood ruined least didn’t kill anyone deadly virus. 

grow pair, really. nearly half patients trials showed evidence lung damage 12 weeks

So still showed damage. need moderate dose achieve normal levels deficient cases. 

It completely safe get much magnesium food. Getting magnesium supplements likely cause symptoms lower levels. 

And large dose person deficiency risks giving person diarrhea nausea. symptoms impossible tell causing symptoms. 

The risks somewhat interesting people chronic disease average healthy people. Yes Sweden full self autonomy, that's got Stockholm Bloodbath. court located Denmark. Much like Polish Lithuanian commonwealth Austria-Hungarian union. Chest tightness due depression anxiety real. come know even feeling anxiety attack.It one symptoms condition itself. recovery content trauma (which like pain also fight apathy) became gray apathetic... quite scary since days bits nice emotions. Like cozy sunday morning watching fluff content ? (I'm almost tearing realizing this). advice keep mind state forever.

My trick 1) let dull sink in... like rubbing wound 2) trying aim mundane stuff people do.. hope/sense rain know. (obv. sight lively people still cause harmful feelings)

On note I'm gonna ride bike blue sky while. lung cancer ash falling sky study far small. 

N=70? something. 50 people Vitamin 20something without. 

It's little early praising Vitamin D. I'd like see 1000 person study scientific rigor. 

This BS Ronda Patrick does. Tiny studies. Big results. Let's go crazy!

Is something there? Yeah. good healthy levels vitamins body.

Is curing Covid? No. 

The standard care administered old many standards. Drugs found work given. feel ya, cat 13 years passed away end February... started lock major sads... Perfect example fuckery desert Schools NY open? Particularly NYC? facts opinion? diagnosed obsessive compulsive? get PhD? counter evidence discovered back claims? Haha thanks edit. first thought Snoqualmie auto correct SmoothieKing... like put vitamin smoothie topped it.

I’m still sure ‘topped out’ means.  so? Nowhere around globe thing happened. Countries kept covid check spring experiencing huge surges moment. Everyone treading water best nobody eliminated virus. Nobody. 

I Czech, weve around 350 new infections daily spring. went 50.. going 800 new infections per day. Fast. people going traditional ""I dont give fuck"" told affer routine bloodwork 7 years ago low vitamin doctor called “the diagnosis decade.” bottom, low, still normal range level. guess lot people low. also told takes awhile taking vitamin supplements see change blood levels. write letter insurance company appeal $200 COVID19 lab test, network provider went sent tests lab network. Nice good. feel bad think probably visited restaurants lately? Maybe gotten haircut nails done? feel bad working schmuck whose livelihood depends serving selfish plague rats like Interesting. wonder process takes 7 days. Like, exactly happening time? ""Infuencer"" job title apparently require education common sense. here... shit sucks can’t even feel like complain many people worse (or literally died) tests obviously crap diagnostic tool reduce need social distancing measures own.

BUT: many times epidemic, we've seen things perfect dismissed useless. useless certainty: suppress epidemic changing behavior temporarily, effective way reduce cost compliance.

If people test get positive result, meaningful. might trigger get PCR test, means people would staying home protecting others situations would otherwise legal endangering them.

So false positive rate 2%: could deploy tests wherever significant number infections (10/100k/week?) *and* actual positive testing rate *or* infections high significant risk individual infected certain period (e.g., per 50 days). situation, significant chance positive result meaningful therefore people voluntarily modify behavior, able accept moderate risk aspects daily lives. Thank fuck im farmer. Might get skin cancer later thats future problem. Screw guy! Good luck skin cancer bud! Im getting covid! variation putting lsd tabs eyelids. live Germany N95 masks bought stores reasonable prices. Almost grocery stores carry form approved masks. Hospitals use surgical masks change often. patient walks hospital without mask, handed one immediately. So, yes, N95 masks valuable commodity scarce, neither medical grade PPE.

I horrified news reports hear US can't understand nation dysfunctional. Even ""rogue"" ""failed"" states seem fare better. usually measured inches, okay. maybe could’ve died/been hospitalized it. I’m glad able stay home. Thanks reminder can’t take vitamin throw caution wind.  “Scientists” “Covid19” don’t believe reinfection, dont trust people’s symptoms, generally dismissive study conducted outside US, means never mention positive study HCQ. 
Oh also forget knowledge flu vaccines 19% - 60% effective short time always due fast mutation. I’ve taking vit d, vit k2 m, vit A, zinc since beginning. info $$$ made Yes. point is... methodology also takes account kind care receive sick. think better receiving care Germany Western Sahara covid related things still deal with? high? Arizona literally crushed outbreak there. single worst hotspot world late June/early July, made HARD turnaround fully pre-surge levels. early slightly concerning signs backslide moment (probably almost entirely due retarded school openings) take away progress that's made. I'm sorry hear that. right wear mask. governments definitely let us pandemic. feel fortunate hospital, PPE adequate. isolation rooms wear yellow paper gown ties back, face mask gloves. Covid-19 positive rooms wear gown, N-95 mask another mask face shield gloves. also worn Papr, enclosed space suit looking thing back pack filter blows air hood. while, said need wear want to. feel protected enough cases wearing it. takes time put clean take one using it. outpatient, wear mask eye protection, either safety glasses face shield gloves. never touch patient without gloves on. far, we've enough PPE stock, reuse N-95 masks replace longer fit right strap breaks. mask day week rotate daily. reuse face shields daily, clean daily. use hand sanitizer entering room immediately exiting room outpatient gel patient. amount hand sanitizer go insane. riots teeming months now... nothing. Rhonda Patrick equal Joe Rogan...

Of course take medical advice MMA commentator. However, read facts something make best decision based facts. article published time Florida ~50 deaths per day NY ~1000 deaths per day. Hard justify saying indicates Florida mess. sceptics, vaccine conspiracy theorists opposed measures chanted made speeches.


They could created Americans believe frogs turned gay, silver toothpaste cure Covid19, demon semen, Alien DNA. Justice. Asking obvious questions here. I, too, want know appears prescription-only drug. get, goes molecule discussions basic biochemistry upsetting \[corporate guess someone got patents / FDA approval / senators pocket specific use. there's valid use COVID, still pay markups even though use nothing approval got? care. care people. pray enough us care vote. told neighbor yesterday I'm ready die cause. Subtext: I'm 58 year old white female school teacher hate spewing executive branch destroyed me. non-medical opinion: think also kind helps explain higher elderly overweight death rates. two groups generally lower vitamin don’t spend much time outside someone young fit would. Generally speaking. shocker... Good. don’t know levels, It’s safe, easy way ensure you’re deficient.

Are you, chance, SKU listener? Left? I'd say liberal, leftist approach would heavy state interference.
In fact I'm surprised Leftists government deferred policy decisions nations health agency. typical Social democracy all. course way scapegoat available.  6% though, number way actual estimates. money? think Jeff Bezos gonna reopen cute kitschy coffee shop like he's done hoovering wealth ruins? understood wrong.
Vit D, dissolves fat.
Excess get stored body fat.

Also. Vitamines (amungst food), categorised fat- water soluble.

Absorbing pill. Requires desolving ""glue"", often water solluble/by stumach contents.
If intended stomach absorption.

In short:
if want increase absorption vitamin pill,
Eat food contains vitamine D.
Then add vitamine pil directly it.

That ensure increased absorption.

Also. Taking 10μ vit D, doesnt mean get 10μ added blood. Case... case... cluster... Yeah, ""Swiss approach"" mean refused give treatment needed it. instances happened for-profit nursing homes beginning pandemic, general, needed ventilators survival put one. doctor determined patient old weak survive intensive care, receive it. save money, save patient needless suffering.

In hindsight, also became apparent putting sick weak ventilators like countries probably counter-productive. Next time, starr coughing. loons grab ahold anything, anyway.  Shit. Colorado? individualistic bring mask - motivations things opposition.

It's matter bull-headed test. ppl still go partying doesnt care virus xD Ofc have, damn pneumonia. Even usual one takes least half year recover. sports probably played night. much wanna bet kid comeback this? really interesting. Could given community level (i.e., community reaches threshold lockdown, everyone takes drug) lieu addition vaccination? really short-term solution post-exposure?  tally many people hospitalized, seems common trend good portion ones dealing post-recovery damages. ""maybe something else"" isnt denial game, genuine reasonable thought, offensive might something fragility.

&amp;#x200B;

well, germeny really act heavily virus without telling public told me. mean, saw videos ny doctor talking virus something else that, kinda knew already. cant seen facts, rigth? would factual known goverments would tell citizen this, wouldnt they?

well, iam still ""i dont know going on""-state think interesting event hopefully enlightening retro perspective. big problem Northeastern campus spread across Boston. Colleges rely heavily off-campus housing students work part-time city. prudent course action would keep students home semester, like said sacrificing little bit greater good happening enough.  place hard hit gotten second wave yet? reached effective herd immunity? Even quarantines really believe people outside NY bringing virus in. Right looking changes 7 day average week period involves pooling 3-400 incidences. 24% increase clearly statistically significant numbers.

We extra granularity English figures using NHS regions, see 'localised outbreaks'?

I MSci pretty good idea can't draw statistically significant results data. I'd like see argue recent data inline previous trends looking said data shows going stick like sore thumb.   yay yep. never depressed. felt genuinely suicidal 2020 never thought would are. It'll take year least safe effective vaccine rigorous testing used everyone without side effects, year mass produce enough entire affected planet another year able deploy everywhere time. *educated guess* based what's happened contagious diseases, though case highly unique. Sure billionaires speed process, complicated situation. years actually generous estimation, especially given historically vaccines normally take many years become viable first place (if done all, vaccines never succeeded), even focus richest countries earth. 

Doom fetishing would lines saying we'll *never* recover Covid, everyone's going die regardless do. cure deployed without ransom, secretly vaccine secretly conspiracy reduce fertility masses nonsense. friendly debate saying economy (it's whole existence) I'm saying.

Still never heard answers question.

Go back bridge troll. Oooohh “I’m 20-something edgy blaming everything Trump” people that's insufficient. blood test way figure particular person needs. role vitamin innate adaptive immunity critical. statistical error estimation recommended dietary allowance (RDA) vitamin recently discovered; correct analysis data used Institute Medicine, found 8895 IU/d needed 97.5% individuals achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed 6201 IU/d needed achieve 75 nmol/L 9122 IU/d needed reach 100  take enough get blood values around 40 ng/ml.

Why say amount? read article correctly, cases diagnosed September, talking bit early.

Surely another spike covid cases people contact people, seeing kind wear mask all.

This 50-something people infected, they're spreading people die. people wait fucking party. That’s part life. People need stop getting caught much. 

Does suck? Yeah. 

Are thousands worse situations depressed due inability socialize first world country? Absolutely.

This reeks privilege. Adjust ffs stop sensitive. Mn mm mm. mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm

K mm mm mm mm mm mm.
O l mm mm mm mm. mm mm mm mm
Mn mm mm mm mm mm mm pop p0p hear that. reality that's always though. like child sex abuse domestic violence common they're almost rule rather exception, basically ""normal"" state species possibly always getting taking regular supplements Could result holiday returnees throughout August? knowledge toxicity reported daily doses 000 IU several  learned pandemic take certain sources pinch salt.

You spin data. virus care spin it. use 2000IU Vitamin D3 day.  think correct. MT two counties zero infected cases yet positive case yet. Carter Petroleum counties.
[Montana arcgis I'm going visit getting flu shot Calm down, trying friendly debate. Sorry, perfectly accurate wording. “couple” centuries. b. bureaucracies Western Countries, even highly redistributives ones (thanks past *socialist* governments), faring much better?

And realize there's pattern, Republican government messes things (Trump, Bush quagmire, Reagan/Bush deregulation inflating debt), between, Democrats painfully restore semblance normalcy (Clinton budget balance, Obama restart economy)? pls turn back positive visions future, shit matters take enough get blood values around 40 ng/ml. much highly individually variable. I'm sure would happen rewatched NGE current state.

Probably whole lot good :\ It’s not....virtually every state executive orders place limiting gatherings kind right familiar research topic, really. quite expected fact. Costochondritis maybe? Yes science hard believe... Yep. know lot people sick all, tested return work school

asymptomatic carriers account something like 40% infected. Look Five Eye think meant come around october year. wish could watch neon genesis first time again. CDC recommended vitamin fighting severe covid cases, knows many deaths could prevented... Oh wow know that. Thanks sharing. I've already gotten shot month I'm sure taking supplements. idea overdose happen implication ""not silver bullet"" statements usually maintain level restrictions (distancing, concerts, etc.) much longer. even internment camps (US)

Internment camps 1940s literally daycare compared re-education camps. Complete joke even compare Nazi concentration camps. throw bunch comedically premature statistics base opinions whatsoever them.

Such ""OMG we're going die children permanently disabled?""

I agree certainty numbers, time better numbers there, extrapolating worst case scenarios irresponsible, letting conclusions go without counter-argument.

But meantime, rational thing take reasonable precautions. Happy Six Months everybody! 🎉 Money economy important damaging economic impact lives too. 

I could almost, almost understand done could left binary choice lives economy. we're not, false choice we've made. 

Wear masks. Adapt activities outdoors car seating. Stagger group activity times. There's much that's done could reasonably reduce risk getting back economic activity. People like might actually go start contributing money local economy precautions always enforced. 

People's insistence ""getting back normal"" ironically keeping us much longer, can't see irony. known months ago thanks sharing really good! Brooklyn pretty damn busy. Someone correct I'm wrong reaction Immune System COVID-19 occurs able get rid virus (which almost never case common cold), virus proves resilient Immune System initiates something called Cytokine Storm process meant hyper activate leucocite get site infection. 

The problem Cytokine Storm there's **lot** collateral damage, tons energy expended immune system top storm going immune system might issues regulating response even enemy antigen longer present lead perpetually worsening inflammation lead organ failure. claiming handle successfully younger population. younger population *and* handled pandemic great care. One take other.

Also sad one country good put America. celebrate people's successes? individualism. basic decency.

You individual still wear mask.

It's shameless selfish indecency obstacle US.   sound like shitty neighbour.

Our region, problem. world, problem. Fuck, give shit half government spends money on, helping impoverished neighbours, fuck could watch day.  true, per day around 10 good now. However, someone else rightly said, deaths come later. succeeding, trying. won't. here's perspective: people vitamin deficient anyways modest dose 1000-2000IU would likely cause issues even someone deficient. figured worst case scenario, i've wasted $11. best case i'm correcting deficiency protecting covid. move house friends too? mean gain herd immunity? Well slowly getting there. Linked article says intervention group received calcifediol, type vitamin found blood. usual type vitamin found supplements. Calcifediol also known 25(OH)D 25-hydroxyvitamin D. reason giving type vitamin usual supplement type takes 7 days turn calcifediol, giving patients calcifediol itself, get good effects without wait 7 days [per Wikipedia].

So guess ""quicker"" vit D? situation Jacksonville pretty much same. I'm going stir crazy keep thinking ""maybe I'll go X"" I'll see friends posting selfies shoulder shoulder people crowded areas masks on. decide, yet again, avoid anything social. Imagine actually believing 20 million could die. 6 months even 200.000 died. want destroy economy that? God feel bad. live Vegas,mask use strictly enforced casinos indoor space. people see strip well. Can’t speak downtown Las Vegas guy actually using brain using? mean deaths per day, around 10 good now. However, like someone else rightly pointed out, deaths come later. that’s fine think learn live get crisis

In sub end sight. Ever. world need constant lockdown still wearing mask social distancing 25 years. depression anxiety often go together. Sometimes feels like rib case started clenching squeezing hurts breathe like sharp pain

There’s times it’s like nowhere cramp chest long Deep makes curl fetal like boyfriend help stretch arms feel like everything’s closing in. It’s fun SOCIALLY ISOLATE YOURSELF!! coming someone incredibly skilled isolating themselves. never worked favor it’s something I’m working right now. 

Yes realize it’s covid time don’t person socialize. Make phone call loved one, send text, even write letter!! doesn’t elaborate well thought out. send it, send simple “I grateful life” text. Receiving text like that, even someone haven’t spoken awhile, mean much.

Your friends CARE you. annoyance them. burden. feelings valid it’s okay them.

These feelings pass. 2020 pass. Stop saying “I wish” “I want” start saying “I will”. come stronger. grow this. go gym. read book. learn cook. 

Brush teeth. Make bed. Take shower. Practice self-care stuff WORKS. you’re depressed get bed find watching tv, highly recommend watching Queer Eye. truly watch it, put phone away. also highly recommend children’s shows you’re deep funk. She-Ra, Avatar series, Adventure Time, whatever makes happy!! Nostalgia hell thing, it’s fun trick brain happy watching something made happy younger. 

Brains amazing easy trick- give shot! it, even don’t believe yet, want know believe you. I’m thinking know beat this. 

Thank here. cell immunity taken account.

And really can’t given current state science.

But sure interesting New York able they’re doing.

It could behavior could definitely something else.   Let's say get scenario vaccine 75% effective 2/3 population takes it, plus point, 1/10th population antibodies naturally.

So means that:

0.9 × 0.67 × 0.75 = 45% population induced immunity

10% natural immunity, total 55%.

The base transmission rate assumed close 3. means that, end vaccine program, infected person would infect 1.35 people mitigations place. (This assumes super-spreaders equally likely infected rest population, may true, course... let's assume scenario is).

If could maintain social distancing months halve transmission rate, we'd close elimination — nothing, we'd infect rest population herd immunity reached (maximum effective transmission rate 1) enough population infected virus significantly declined (perhaps 3 months maximum R(t) = 0.8, somewhere region 75% population immune).

So infect \~20% population naturally order trigger extinction virus, unless maintain element distancing. Obviously 1/3 20% come voluntarily unvaccinated — screw — 2/3 yet-to-be-infected, 13.3%, vaccinated work them. Many vulnerable Covid-19, vaccine would worked first place.

Unless vaccine highly effective high uptake, and/or super-spreaders stopped means, cas lock-down, end public health crisis least severe one we've already gone through. see example people getting fatigue.

Grow up, learn speak others like adult, might taken seriously. complete dick going convince anyone, rather opposite. Remind Me! Two Months I'm fully aware employers consider degree worth less paper printed on. There's also literally nothing point. car salesperson typically large stake finance profit. Likely pissed waste time. said sounds like someone find another line work customer service simply part job. hard time understanding Reddit’s lack understanding HIT. Clearly it’s case NY, London Sweden. Covid chrome? Riiiight.

There one herd you’re following. Let's throw bunch comedically premature statistics base opinions whatsoever them.  Great summary (and gnat, I’d offended comparison). foundational issue see lack national social safety net plan mitigate disaster. thought $1200 going save us? Americans must go back work even non essential areas like recreational businesses.

Not working means getting paid also loss employer-linked health care. hit like would bad time considering primary issue global health crisis, potentially catastrophic person/family. coworkers discussing possible staff cuts staff (even working spouses) sole source health insurance. theoretical job loss scary losing health coverage pandemic terrifying. implemented comprehensive metric based reopening plan, proceeding stages. probably one successful world. like got rid virus, they've kept one percent, ways harder, NY it. sad read,I pray daily safety well every human time. Stay safe friend. average time develop vaccine 7-10 years.

Why brought every two days? This. Is. An. Unprecedented. Situation. 

-Lots $$$ 

-Worldwide effort

-High infection rates (in many parts world) compared many illnesses


People dropping like flies, trying prevent evictions, getting organ damage, global economy crushed. lot incentive trials take decade. 

Also, many experts said phase III take least mid November concrete results show up, there's way widespread vaccine distribution take place 2020. We're year! unemployment rate already higher majority Europe pandemic. long vaccine take it’s actually well like report says? miss outside I’m paranoid bumping someone heart condition bad lungs (it’s dumb know) EXTREMELY relieving read article.

I struggled, mean truly struggled since COVID-19 began mental health. stopped showering, eating, exercising, communicating/texting people. 

I seriously become non-functional. depression truly sunk tendrils every facet life COVID-19 way world now.

Two weeks ago, began seeing psychiatrist (zoom say). started Wellbutrin. feel slowly climbing abyss.

Help there. anyone wants talk please DM me. Agreed. would like specifically like California shut roads highways leading State. want anymore anti-maskers State! local Walmart hundreds boxes available, low low price $27 each. remember like $8-10 box right panic. ""No one wants next 'Wuhan' terms leadership. ""

But thats problem argument, exactly would cases go unreported. 

Using places also clear virus new cases much argument. China also clear new cases, kind inevitable. China new infections worked hard contain eliminate them, far harder countries mentioned.

As media restrictions, yes media controlled. information flow nearly tight may think, live city recent outbreak (if call handful cases outbreak) news gossip flying official announcements. really believe China complete control internet really case.

I'm pretty sure never convinced, want naive kind using preconceived ideas China without actually truly knowing place. Fucking rich!

3rd world countries better job managing pandemic US!

Funny hilarious! health ministry attributed spike recent ""large gatherings"" took place without recommended safety measures, including mask-wearing social distancing. Depends many factors. skin tone, routine. Diet, etc. blood tested last month doctor prescribed 50k IU weekly. 

Only thing check levels. take vitamins hope. I'm sure news. ragging OP all. makes sense. scary people dropping like flies, ones survive could long-term possibly even lifelong complications affect quality life. 

I mental illness begin with, underlying health conditions make vulnerable. I'm old, I'm mother 4 children, 3 young still much needing mother. 

The idea could contract disease die suddenly incredibly stressful makes feel like theres hope future.  k-12 schools open tomorrow. haven’t checked little last knew ~75% school districts hybrid full in-person opening.  Lol say vaccine gives immunity 5g they'll change minds /s American wish fat killed virus Meh. Let die. Right, supplements take longer get place. Lemme rephrase:  
50% patients still show damaged lungs 12 weeks. Monk mode Honestly disturbing part transparency corruption, it’s fact 50% country look thing are, say it’s happening. take long - numbers inaccurate. passed us likley month ago.  Thank you.  (American) end comment gut punch. really wish *majority* federal government cared health safety. complete delusion think do. wish even pretended care. 

If dental license largely tied America (even tied certain states US), absolutely would move. felt proud American long time. 

I'm sure largely said, current leadership, amount hateful, ignorant Americans getting platform becoming ever vocalized overwhelmingly depressing. can't even go protests anymore without armed, trigger happy, millitia showing up.


I'm second ammendment rights. copy constitution, multiple pistols, rifles, shotguns ARs. advocate gun safety constant continuing education/practice. bring guns?!?!

I wish could live Canada crazy moose instead. 33. Estonia

34. Latvia

Tot Cases / 1M pop, Deaths / 1M pop, Tests /1M pop

Estonia: **1,908** 48 **120,919** 

Latvia: **759** **19** **140,956** 

&amp;#x200B;

Latvia way less cases, way less deaths tests.. Tell Estonia ?

What factors matters much ? Let rip.  No, point old people make vast majority China virus deaths. Senegal's population young - know, people small chance dying due China virus. surprising countries like fewer deaths. Yes, on-site classes high school uni march-june.

Yea, think tents going work. see using PA, often. get anywhere near cold upper midwest, cost heating astronomical get inside around 60-70. Without good insulation, tents would destroy profits restaurants would make, already slim margins is. 

Not mention winds keeping everyone indoors, different indoors. They're practical number ways pandemic. I’d better get muppet calls president. in: UN Forced Admit Gates-Funded Vaccine Causing Polio Outbreak Africa

Statement another vaccine failure, really wants take rushed Covid vaccine? One thing note taking Vitamin supplements ineffective Magnesium levels low: best take chelated Magnesium supplement btw cheap Magnesium (eg Magnesium Oxide) extremely poor (like 2%) bioavailability.

For Vitamin D3, take supplements K2, also important co-factor help prevent issues Calcium levels. supplementing since April. usually I’m outside enough probably don’t need much. Don’t supp everyday good. decline human population help climate change. Damn nobody cares anymore wtf would certainly explain higher level resistance children threatening symptoms Second wave bois job exponentially getting worse daily basis country dying, I'm pretty sad.

Lol

Do really think locking everyone year longer, dozens millions losing/will lose job better people's wealth, health, future development opening back right measures?

Also, there's clear link underlying health issues covid 19. lose weight fattie guess wasnt anyone near Oxford willing take it? Anyway awesome news side effects werent severe Pentagon HWAT thing every case China quite widely published,
Press freedom among lowest world. live city recently cases, know details said case, contract tracing taken seriously.

Worthless fluff comment end, one denying last statement. know details press controlled government, vested interest reporting. think attempt hide cases otherwise whole thing falls apart pretty quickly.

Not reason national government hide cases, may even *larger* benefit hide cases local government. one wants next 'Wuhan' terms leadership. 

Likewise, say good things stating China New Zealand yet local transmission - nation less 5 million people **literal island**. rudimentary class statistics tell answer doubts. South Korea, nation 50 million, likewise small resurgence. taken extremely seriously general populace freaks even dozen cases. Thankfully, press local governments actually able report going on. 

Once again, mince words here, extraordinarily naive believe *zero* domestic transmission.  What's PPE routine curiosity? Im healthcare worker (not hospital private homes) right we've given exactly 0 PPE specific job deemed low risk, work one client. We've told treat work part social bubble wouldnt help flatmates close family go bathroom, get dressed high intensity things work. absolutely absurd. trying source PPE privately case meanwhile wear masks work told idiot UK government constantly change goalposts. similar study showing effects supplement pills probably best stick recommended daily amount.

RDA wrong wont work. better approach would take enough get blood levels around 40ng/ml. much D3 translates different different people. observational studies accumulated, converged common point 30-40 ng/mL sweet spot infection risk, severity, mortality lowest, without risk getting much vitamin D. subreddit suffers serious self selection bias. people would post ones worst symptoms. Also lot symptoms may psychosomatic nature. There's way world Sweden would work US, involved strong social safety net giving people help, along trusting people behave responsibly people faith government. Eventually, plague end things go back normal.

Will it? brand capitalism society runs rug pulled it. never sustainable, collapse apparently one catastrophe away.

So rotting foundation given way everything falling apart. mean slightly possible, highly unlikely. accusing company something without slightest hint evidence. No, fuck you, shit becomes normal I'd rather kill myself. That's disappointing.

Intermittent localized lockdowns different beast locking nationwide. 40% accounts obesity. overweight pre-diabetic hypertensive, etc... obesity. Luckily obesity greatest heuristic use, general population United States really risk it. 

The government tries push possibilities severe COVID consequences rare vulnerable groups (which claim fully isolated); reality vulnerable groups fully integrated general population.

Constantly fed alternate controversial information virus, **the importance getting anyone else sick entirely lost public.** really ""choose reality"" adventure show right now, long-term consequences severe. daily reported numbers useless though. 

Sero studies indicate 30% population new Dehli already infected c.6m people.

For context total number reported cases India worldometer around That's nonsense - calling something un-American violates core American principles slur, way protect values.

Unfortunately, people shifted away core American values soft concepts religion, like 'family values'.

When take away ability people protest peacefully, engaging distinctly un-American behavior. right described Constitution, key principle establishing country nearly 250 years ago, anything harm much un-American. antivaxxers men, uneducated poor try telling fellow Americans trump lovers won’t wear masks. 

We know people suck.

Sincerely,

Most Americans hate Americans What’s French Karen? believe UK Government take factors account positivity rate. That's Portugal added quarantine list exceeded 20 cases per 100,000. Slightly misleading headline. WWII US pumped two 14,000 ton cargo ships day among ships.

Lol clearly never New York. people fled New Yorkers pleasure! 0.1% 19 million lifetime conditions already much. tl;dr I've places seen things. travelled NYC last weekend, lot stop spread. Queens, Long Island, Manhattan, etc. everywhere went, majority people street wearing masks attempting socially distance. plane ride there, made fill travelers form well. I’ve getting two calls day every day since state checking doing. much respect moment them. 647,000 people died heart disease last year give one single fuck. Anybody claims empathy entire human race lying. Astoria nights/weekends bad Reddit users afterthought. tried posting two different ways.

None satisfy powers get talk this. feel attacked facts? Many already this. part dont understand question asked people dont want wear mask. might think answers valid excuses (I dont access...really?) valid answers question. Saying right wear one isnt reason arent wearing it. , best, justification dont think forced wear one. doesnt actual answer arent choosing wear it. 

If asked wear mask say ""because government enforce public safety rules"". dont give single fuck mask laws apply I'm wearing either way. start understanding data Yes sir, point Shout Governor Wolf Montco County Commissioners (or 2 3) proactive aggressive mitigation. one first counties closed east coast. shame mods removed like cowards. post break rules assuming quoted entirety truly shows depth mind virus taken hold society. 👍🏻 dunno, way 2020 going... we've already got riots mass unemployment. could see easily devolve civil war, point bets table.

This. it’s waiting game vaccine...  Regardless, continue clean like we've past couple months? grocery store never looked good, probably cleaned much always been. Interesting, week 35, 85k tests (which highest testing far Sweden) positivity ratio dropped 1.5% low ""testing little"". 3 weeks earlier 50k tests per week positivity ratio 3%. seems me, infection rate higher now, increased 50% testing compared able catch it. 

Denmark pharmaceutical industry produce in-house testing kits en masse. find another country Europe 4% population tested every week? think right Sweden testing similarly lot european countries: Maybe could delve information domestic abuse around world. Studies indicated immunity vaccines lasts longer stronger immunity someone recovered virus.

Whether mismanagement simple lack supply - hospital essentially providing ANYTHING

Edit add - must - wear n95 hospital provide surgical mask... malicious compliance keep everything. Reddit users seems like kindergarten. Funny watch side sad humanity. HIT probably around 20%, might overshot like NYC. Immunity thing, antibodies showing entire spread. T-cell thing. Cross immunity thing. Mask hardly work. Social distancing works. Washing hands works.

Schools havent really open long enough cases caught school. interesting see outcome that. far seems children tested positive got covid outside school. Let's hope hasnt spread. sons school already 2 students test positive. neither caught school understand. Unless vaccine blowdart gun use see careless people, seem better start protecting vulnerable. may even able count careless willing take vaccine, can't afford mess up. Current 7 day average deaths per day countries mentioned article Vs number peak (between brackets)

Totally worth panic.

Let guess, two weeks...?  Gyms absolutely open proper precautions 1) many examples already CDC, FDA, governmental agencies bowing political pressure, including pandemic;

2) companies often think short term, long term. Moreover, real issue intentionally put bad vaccince, rush cut corners vaccine actually think good rewards great (not money, Nobel Prizes fame well). cut corners could wrong even really believe vaccine work. look senator background vaccinology understand whether vaccine safe not. Nice ""source"" lol. PROPER PPE mask yes properly fitted wearer trained use take without contaminating everything.

Bits cloth nappy stuffed face like wot everyone general public - waste time. cases rising across Europe think slowly entering 2nd wave.

I got invitation yesterday, mention safety measures anything COVID-19. It’s clear fiancé living different reality. Canadian struggling w depression summer. hospital May ideation Notice numbers posted governments far less US.

No, devastated every nation earth, right even worse US. US failure fucked even embarrassment resources ample win presidential election plunge us Marxist system government.

You actually believe this? 

Democrats run country decades... including recently three half years ago... never ""plunged us Marxist system government"" even hinted thing. completely right-wing invention designed scare gullible people.

Edit: I'm getting downvoted personal experience suburban New Jersey? Okay reddit. can't believe people STILL want wear mask social distancing, give fuck human beings know lol...survival fittest, die corona virus, bad luck. fucking care die...? best thing government help people out. That’s it’s for. I’m sick capitalists jerk numbers. Isn’t funny every “evil pressuring family member” mentioned happened woman? Internalized misogyny/straight misogyny. Start tequila... state Victoria, Australia went back full lockdown (and now) quarantine failure incoming travellers lead community transmission breaking again. Remind Me! 2 weeks give much shit everyone gave prior March...not much.

What losing job business? Norway average 1 death per week, Sweden average 1 per day. Auckland new zealand went back pre summer lockdown August although came again. That's pre summer lockdown know Well… yay!

Bear Down!  fucking stupid!!!! I'm surprised well mental health holding up. Maybe lesson prioritize alone time, rest, self development often, even distractions normalcy return. Yeah I’m technically obese according bmi charts appear little overweight. think distinction valid. can't wait freely without fear. RNA vaccines new type vaccine even approved human use yet – usage could test phases. innovation concerns adverse reactions. Interestingly, purely anecdotal, patients I’ve seen immunocompromised sometimes don’t get sick fully functional immune system. lot Covid deaths actually cytokine storms, basically overreaction immune system. immunocompromised patients tend get sicker start, cytokine storm tends happen scary week in, much smaller chance happening.

What would cold weather really change? waves theory banks people living differently summer winter kinda falls case nobody could really anything summer anyone outside household. think second wave is, dramatic. article say retesting showed false negatives. Please find scientific peer reviewed paper says mask works? Hint. doesn’t exist. Reinfections currently microscopic. immunity isn’t off, gives protection next time you’re exposed virus. immunity isn’t thing, well vaccine useless too. country city still fully lockdown. Like retail stores, restaurants, hotels, borders, stay home order pre summer lockdown? know sub isn’t indicative real life. Social media skewed people panicking homes aren’t shitposting reddit. people I’ve talked irl think like us  Wearing mask giving anyone kidney.


Chilling home draining life's savings.


We get give shit others die. people like pretend care people may depressed now. tried posting r/science got deleted. agree. brand seem like issue, flammable ingredients do. figure alcohol it? guess public needs warned flammable. thought people knew already, maybe not.  Dang that's crazy. wife immunocompromised getting covid worst nightmare It’s number stayed low answer question. polio disappeared one suffering it, yet people suffering logically can't disappeared. 

Also statement clearly says, polio outbreak caused vaccine itself. original polio vaccine nearly wipe disease, new vaccines bringing back. one ever died anything except ceasing electrical activity brain  Well duh. government taken everything found fun stress relieving away corporations still demand constant sacrifice. lost job, hard fuck find another one still job work now. miss LARPing. Definitely possible. indoor dining cities upstate, rhe bars pretty much dead due regulations. winter going interesting. People wont able dine outdoors. Indoor dining pick bit. bars going suffer heavily people still weary sitting bar. Yeah whole subreddit head buried sand, it’s really sad. Might worse what? wearing one? Thats case individually help much everyone help lot more.

This straight ignorant it, find actual scientific article explaining mask dont work? seen people getting reinfection right? Meaning immunity probably window. Dur. You’re right. case, I’m frustrated won’t chance vote democrat office 2022. Here’s hoping lack incumbent advantage allow us change particular office blue. [Turns I’m one doesn’t trust going ask Sen. Harris peer reviewed research vaccine proven safe yet? Hey, hey guys come on. gotta take it, else rest us know safe side effects? think already know NYC numbers low. Politics. /r/lostredditors ? favor! guess technically mask thing big deal. much lower risk spreading apparently actually it, able much. claimed GA better elderly. not. lets talk death rate. GA shit job hand dealt. early states misfortune vulnerable populations hit hard federal government lied containment screwed testing month spread silently. months prepare, actual testing, lower population density better treatments, letting 8000 people die Nov GA worse protecting nursing homes horrendous. many false negatives? feel like country different definitions excess deaths- me, patient covid time death does- even comorbidity factor, covid cause. Especially -BUT FOR- covid, patient would hospital contracted pneumonia heart failure. 

This method flawed, course, someone heart disease gets covid May died year anyway, statistics- comparing previous year heart disease deaths current year heart disease deaths give insight numbers are. There’s definitely something bigger going on, agree that. mod team months back, ran couple high schoolers, whoever else recruited now. nefarious sub, uses threads like weekly updates never really discussed sub. warning moderator bot probably bit harsh end, subs harmless, damage ineptitude perhaps. Seems reporter/author's version higher education French equivalent attempted US GED... Super lofty education.

Or maybe shoddy reporting like often case Huh, that's pretty much straining gnats swallowing camels then. thanks explaining.  
I never denied table distance good precaution though. Chinas xi jinping russias putin stupid trump boris shows beholden business lobby politicians are. ones try put health first get viciously attacked media. Well, now. some, yes Jeez man, things people hire instead trying DIY, electrical work tied plumbing top list. electrician, kind things see people feeling entitled to? concern, Dude. Sunday UK authorities announced 2,988 new cases - highest figure since 22 May, 2,948 cases reported 24 hours 09:00 BST Monday.

Not bad Spain France lately, won’t take long get control RemindMe! 120 Days “hmmm lets see” know life that's basically pause, right? basically whole world. Yes, sucks, gotta adapt. else fails, use downtime something else instead moping able research. world sucks big time, sucks everyone. fraction suspect really mean ""I'm tired thinking hearing want go away?"" 10 deaths per day.  This. It’s important realise. insanely clever. husband got flu shots three half weeks ago. got Target without insurance cost $15. Hw probably still shedding huge viral load.

He this. sorry hear that. place take something away people apparently need lives yet, spend many hours trying explain people bible Theology, History. evangelicals around luckily forced dance around debate them. mean doesn’t covid mostly kill old people Africans young Maybe best choice words. meant magnum opus, suppose. one large thing forever known for, regardless anything else he's done do. neighbors must thrilled. wish could mail insulin, grandfather type 1 diabetes. great British NHS gave free insulin 50+ years free charge. (Also gave double leg knee amputation free charge pretty much saved life infection). 

One day legal weed UK free insulin friend, broken system US cant hold much longer collapses itself.  I'm sure studies since pretty much confirmed wearing mask helps, need keep studying fairly obvious.

Isnt indicators one combined social distancing? really think everyone's immune even though like 3% population got NY alone even much? OK dude. curious medical exemption prevents covering racist mouth hole prevent smoking... Fucking heartless mother fuckers share reasons street are?

Homelessness? Protests/demonstrations? Doomsday sayers religious zealots? find Zola, since idiots think delete wedding website! imagine media name soon, seem hiding...but doxxing allowed reddit lot people call bad cold flu. 

They mistaken.

The actual flu horrible. High fever, deep muscle aches. Everything hurts flu. usually last whole week. sheer misery. I'm sure saying that's high low, sub like good news. Ah yes remember people saying responsible college kids would be. 

Completely ignoring can't actually control clap. Obvious political move obvious I'm going go ahead trust experts one. Reddit experts, real experts. Spooky! Q. Must facility report deaths residents occur hospitals NHSN’s LTCF COVID-19 Module?

A: Yes, LTCF COVID-19 Module include reporting deaths another location. clarified COVID-19 module instructions facilities use reporting resident impact facility capacity. HMRC? Remember Boris happily mentioned still shaking hands people, including ward COVID patients, May? Literally day government's Scientific Advisory Group Emergencies expressly said touch people?

I know got 'Rona himself, human level that's sad, likely killed people - albeit roundabout way - refusing take hand hygiene seriously. government's shambolic response crisis killed even more.

He sucks this, should... stop. stop. definitely tell you, company, employs 40,000 people US, moving 80% non-essential workers WFH. made decision based survey employees back May early June.

Much tech sector really commoditized, profit margins productivity measures really matter. made abrupt shift WFH exclusively non-essential employees, 80% workforce, back first week March. business collapse, actually booming demand everyone else moving WFH created. almost see light bulb went head CEO, always favored traditional office environment. balance sheet moved quickly. Appalling. Lol nobody else interpreted way. Maybe lay “420” FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb says?! Maybe get Coronavirus information Virologists Fuckin FDA!? Implying doctors uneducated... Attending class remotely country get Visa compromised? even mean? Super young median age, super low rates obesity, somebody dies nobody gives shit. else need? wrong  true, think unease generally TRUMP related SCIENCE related.... 

I certainly vaccine, long TRUMP approving. Australia/Canada/Japan/EU etc.. West facing new war terror, new 9/11, politicians like Trump Johnson would riding high, like Bush did. 

That’s Trump trying prop big bad antifa terrorist threat. Maybe leading October Surprise people claiming antifa commit terrorist act name Joe Biden Democrat-led city. nonsense can’t envision right now. 

Coming administration stole PPE veterans hospitals poisoning post office major institutions, would shocked nothing. I'm pretty certain vaccine going safest one. going billion users using know whether side effects understand that's source using. link source explicitly says claiming. I'll believe you. Next stage: Get everyone stop testing.   bumbling old posh English accent. learnt sort act school. whole man act. means infecting others, right?:( Economic considerations healthcare ones. likely way avoid bankruptcy point. Unfortunately pretty much alright. im slightly confused tone, sounds like US yeah, that's exactly large portion right wing religious folks speak, there's hatred contempt baked much religious culture here

what think outdated alive well US lol. probably safely make broad assumption lot US culture lol

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Honestly, feel bad extroverts. super outgoing coworker, tell hard social distancing hit her. Meanwhile, introvert, best thing ever. i’m still lol’ing front row girl’s expression first photo 😂 girl 👉🏻👈🏻 That’s awesome! wish set like that. It’s impossible kids six feet apart 24-27 7th graders classroom. would thrown water I'm starting think part plan reach herd immunity infecting primarily younger people. True, pandemic plans (for UK, least) focussed responding flu type virus, this. Lots re-work required ‘in moment’, helps one. Ive waiting people claim power/knowledge start shitting issue like covid fucks everything. *Curb Enthusiasm music plays* leader needed step keep country focused. Pity happen. Education substitute intelligence. Here's one data point. phrasing FHM interesting. give *general advice* advising comply rules regulations. recommendations hand that. even backed legal obligation Swedish citizen necessary reduce spread dangerous diseases. definitely follow recommendations well. It’s trust, big stick. math based spherical humans evenly dispersed vacuum.

Reality people varying levels likelihood get spread infection. Imagine city bus driver suburban professional working home. bus driver likely catch covid, exposed people, time, it, herd immunity effect even greater suburban professional it, bus driver also exposing people per day. shouldn’t allowed post parents’ basement. Electrician who’s phone blowing holiday weekend, concur. People country can’t shit themselves, want feel entitled anything everything. Western countries full bad leaders? can’t countries focus fighting virus like many countries have? world would better place he'd died RemindME! 120 Days “Is finally fucking vaccine available?!” Y12. One bubble. 200 students. Multiple younger siblings bubbles 150 students. What. The. Fuck. Look history prohibition.  Hurt immunity, see Right ya.

My kids' school already started 20% elected virtual. Even families taking things serious first shipped kids back. feel like outlier times know even though cases low now, winter coming kids better stable learning environment rather switch back forth quarantines pop up.

A local highschool announced football team quarantine positive case miss start season. matter time case hits school. lots students actually sealed inside... Ah! Yes, makes sense: thanks! Well, Bolsonaro surely got best medicine / treatment money buy, cure yet. So: bit both, OP? friend calls boris “trump lite” 😂

let’s run away together “You can’t that” think so, judging general effectiveness containment across many parts Africa, think fat black american thing. die, ergo big deal - bad cold days work. bubbles overlap. bubbles. masks. It’s absolute cockshambles. bot posting every sub link, tbh. much shit single mask! 🤬 stupid Boris. I’m UK there’s school near 2 classes isolating staff teacher tested positive- school open 3 4 days Nah, realization fucked American society terrible Americans people.

How nobody cares public health, country care human life anyway shape form, care live die.

A country buy gun cause someone could fuck nobody help you. every-man people throw bus get ahead without second thought.

That's fucking depressing thing. broken rotten American society is. Great, let know remains tens thousands volunteers. Thanks. wedding already paid for, mostly paid for, venue saying ""since restrictions lifted legally host wedding need hold x date we're voiding contract keeping money."" understand people would say ""screw it"" wedding despite COVID.

Like, sure, marriage really actual wedding losing $10k-$15k *more* event never happen HUGE pill swallow. See, seem unaware fact conceded argument made third sentence respone post mine thread. studies mention comparison asshats brainlets, Sturgis, think Bill Gates weaponized Covid19. brainlets, unfortunately mathematics like science care ideologies feelings, lumped alongside us aware dangers Covid19. words,, numbers numbers. aside, fuck window licking trump humpers.

Statistics, using argument literally equations used physics, also mathematics used literally everything else. main argument regarding yours, wrong assume physics smaller paradigm Covid19 regarding society United States. Unfortunately know unwillingness. Im getting really sick political hypocrisy surrounding really think we're stupid sadly seeing lot replies utter nonsense reddit think might be. complete opposite experience. worst offender daughter deceased, hugged someone. I’m progressive come usually board repercussions hateful speech...but man...not sure punishment fits action here. apology insensitive would suffice. Yes, made worried! I'm 28. answer questions, swollen, got painful swollen got, big yawn would hurt really bad. really hurt put lot pressure it, that, pain unless big yawn lot pressure. tiny bit cartilage now, moveable, got big could wiggle little completely move remember correctly. felt fine that, fever ate healthy worked out. now, painless. experiencing abnormal symptoms time, weight loss experienced due exercise getting toned via body-weight exercises cardio.

Yes, healthcare system country sucks. think Canada us beat there. Thank help, nice know someone cares. Places quarantine laws effect really need step enforcement them. finished 14 day quarantine last week, hear anything entire duration. visits all, even single phone call. 

Right seems expecting deterrent, work one everyone know follow-up *at all*.  ""Afraid shadow"" right wing dogwhistle regarding covid, I'd concerned media mom consuming. Actually article says ""could be"". verdict yet. think 750k maximum penalty, maybe government use example Americans. schizophrenic retarded? Surely can't actually think everyone knows covid deadly fun? thing life changed sudden, drastic manner unable cope intellectually issue. incapable surviving pandemic. See out. woman say ""you move away me, jump"" took steps back her. would seen jaw drop wearing mask lol. Living country really every man nobody gives single shit others would step dying body without second help depressing itself. give single shit country care care life.   one politicians grifters ever promised even hoped vaccine would ready time frame US Government pushing. Every last reputable scientist, epidemiologist, virologist Medical professional maintained best case scenario working vaccine least year 18 months commencement work vaccine

Literally experts, including Dr. Fauci, believe safe effective vaccine become available less amount time. meant get married last month home country. We're two witnesses maybe another two people. Honestly I'm happy simplified. Weddings scam. Every vendor taking advantage marking shit up, everyone involved makes typically tens thousands dollars single day spend year + (if lucky) stressing planning. Thanks Covid. Let save click:


In video exchange posted Twitter, apparently class introductions, student told Poor Wuhan, China. Poor responded: “Wuhan? Well, let get mask on.” Oh we're definitely page lol. that's okay, good debate lead agreement, better understanding hopefully.

So understanding long term effects mean lock do. needed lock either community spread low vaccine. understanding long term effects careful things like sending kids back school. way advocating locking years, get vaccine. That's it.

And cannot say understand long term effects still short term. literally come time. Anything else conjecture hypothesising.

I also fully buy economic arguments. something makes feel like economy magical creature never change evolve exactly like before. I'm going get post bigger topic. take away yes agree economic damage good. think end argument something I'm willing sacrifice lives. 

In end, think different ideas role government. think it’s cool protests you’re mandates masks, theres also lot don’t mandate (hence 25% estimate). You’re right, dies quickly outside. still feel, especially beginning, packed would hit moment someone ucoughed whatever. guess agree disagree? study underdeveloped third world countries. feel like I’m depressed days, it’s cooped - it’s seeing terribly people treat other, non politic things turned politics. hate accepted many places still, actually getting common people aren’t worried hiding anymore. shitty human species whole, really.

I used lie bed dream human race expanding earth stars surviving eons. lie bed pray don’t get leave planet sun takes us. species don’t deserve it. “Most probably” “possibly?”

using available data official sources one show “lifelong” symptoms segment population recovered disease hasn’t even studied year?  

Evidence suggests large percentage people get COVID symptoms mild symptoms. 

I don’t want suggest COVID isn’t serious.  Lots people dying disease, age 0-39 according data 1% COVID deaths. always interesting watch people ride roller coaster celebrate roller coaster goes downhill anyone could take credit it.

We leadership - cases go up, people wear masks avoid high risk activities. cases go down, people start going bars indoor restaurants. 

Spoiler alert - cases go bit Labor Day celebrations, schools opening, college partying cooler weather drive again. people adjust go again. Rinse repeat get vaccine partial herd immunity. Something smells fishy. Well 3 support free independent Taiwan, free independent Hong Kong revolution time. share sentiments Yep like Governor Death Sentence... Honestly extra year plan great too. Helps filter actually want kinda felt like have. ? 

You one saying discovery needed made “fast”. simply stated truth. L f*cking OL successfully defend No.1 spot Europe.  could threaten sue. 300 person gathering probably illegal places point anyway. exactly, serve reservoirs returning infected students home families communities. deaths usually 1 - 2 months cases. low level probably reflective period started opening up. Nope. ""Are better them"" mentality did. Quite big difference - verb vs descriptor; general direction action vs self-congratulatory bullshit.

But fair enough; natural enough people obsessed 'be' eventually assume 'are'. Cases steadily going down, bravo! can't rest country same? I'd blame decades propaganda ""librul urban values."" NYC America's darling early 2010s so. Think Americans rallied around NYC 9/11, compared disdainful average suburban American treats now, even going far mock hard-hit NYC early phases coronavirus pandemic, try pin country's mistakes one city. delight they've come think ""liberal city elites"" suffering. normal okay people depressed little human contact. cant imagine ppl dedicated enough that. Can't open website UK.... *Sad said dozens times lately.

The original American epidemic narcissism. many old Mexico report? I've gotten lot pissy since start pandemic too. takes maybe 2 seconds throw mask properly people can't manage that? “The average age patients 61. 60% male, almost 50% current former smokers, 65% overweight obese.”

Their sample doesn’t exactly seem representative general population. confusing underlying conditons comorbidity.
A comorbidity something have, cause death. Like total heart failure.

Of mf course old people underlying conditions dead. diabetics dead. Thank fuck live country politized virus fucked response patheticly bad laughing stock world. serious trust. lot people, “quarantine” seems mean “run errands every days instead every day”.  matter manipulate data, India eventually become No.1 cases number deaths. course! May ask couple questions? swollen, painful painless? movable immovable? symptoms enlarged infection (eg, fever, night sweats, body aches, etc.)? say swelling gone down, painful painless? last question, experiencing abnormal symptoms since (ie, weight loss, etc.)?

And confirm, one side?

The healthcare system country awful. honestly abdomination. able answer questions, may able offer better idea could be! Oh, would hurt. fights masks. only. Working home best thing ever me, see girlfriend more, free time, save never happier work.

When things return normal, could still work home would get better. less commute time see friends well.

There's definitely balance needs hit though, 9 - 5, two hour commute 5 days week though. 2 days office, 3 days home would dream 80k people died seasonal flu 2018 United States.  Cancelling spending money event would even disastrous people desperate weddings? people really care need go risk health? First all, hate weddings, boring lol. I’ve really appreciative site helps break transmission sources (known/unknown source etc) shows well recently regard mystery cases: Melbourne! miss mum grateful many people take seriously. Imagine endangering lives day vanity. Go courthouse get done. Save bullshit reception dies down. It’s serious. Humanity deserves die Cute reply, actually download it, you? believe covid-19 real find interesting get specific numbers anything protests Ah, yes, Cuomo. guy brethren accuse hiding nursing home deaths, suddenly trying inflate numbers. Cant people come better disinformation campaign that? weak. live MN watched livestreams lot protests saw lot masks. many protests required masks wanted part them. 

That's true distancing since outside virus would quickly die wind sun think important distance outside compared inside. seen posts protest spread like said many cases connected protests. reopening businesses especially bars, restaurants, gyms shown contribute rise cases. Lol. dr. Demon semen? ‘only’ serious heavy lifting headline I'd definitely say I'm one lucky feeling less stressed ever time relax stay focus myself. know I'm literally outlier people fortunate job losses.

Going twitter days makes blood boil amount idiots spreading misinformation that's downside I’m still looking answers myself. good idea let virus spread pursuit herd immunity? This. That's did. Court house Aug 7th baby born Aug 29th! 
We engaged planning wedding found pregnant btw.... Thanks. know internet strangers actually really meant lot. Yes! garage store flood. Nobody care damn pandemic anymore. open already We’ve using track polio three decades. agree, that's never said ""VACCINATE RICH"", said vaccinate SPEND. There's big difference. Back-to-back cancellations would disaster. got start somewhere. *My comment removed ""incivility"", not, actually indisputable fact. info, look Canadian Residential Schools Catholic Homes Single Mothers. also indisputable fact tax dollars Canada fund this.*

Too bad case Canada. Canada paid public tax dollars.

Christianity (Mostly Catholicism) also responsible murder, torture, rape, kidnapping abuse 150,000+ First Nations children babies Canada ""Residential Schools"" ran 1883 1996 murders / kidnappings babies ""Catholic Homes Single Mothers"".

I wish USA's separation religion government, even though constantly attack, least guys it. That's important. Age 0-39 1% COVID deaths, according data. Hahaha... yep. dealing breakup last year January planning start getting dating again. BOOM... shit hit. I've caught explaining realizing I'm sadness hipster. friends laugh horrible timing. Lol... get it. Thank you. swelling gone, little cartilage jaw now. well financially, see do. dentist looked at, seem concerned. Take out, Take away catering. Making meals sell local shops high end-ready meals.
Making whole fancy weekend meals needs heating perhaps small finishing touches.

Tableservice select - 25% - 50% fewer patrons ample distances between.

Use karma app. Karma app helps restaurants, cafés coffee shops clear last meals reduced price people come collect closing.  Cause Brazil matter. /Sarcasm. likely cost related alongside enough healthy sick. countries struggled too. Don’t fall trap xenophobia. Easily exceed number guests. sone good points. However, Portland last month. saw barely anyone wearing masks. Google BLM protests you’ll see. Plus, masks dont much u dont social distance. Also, reddit never talks BLM spread. Plus, cant go outdoor concerts wear masks? didn’t downvote you, answering respectfully. Rare online disagreements (sry formatting, im mobile) realize stating indisputable facts ""incivil"". Even gayer I'm sure couples sheltered home months end sight, snowstorm magic ticket. living 65 acres ever shitty? Maybe I'm seeing cons it... Genius. Dying concern. 78% mild cases result permanent heart damage. going happen like chickenpox/shingles. even know long-term effects virus people think immediately killed it, they'll ok. u/undeleteparent guidelines marshmallow test washouts can't handle luxurious compared deal months years end deployed. personal worst stretch 20 24 months deployed boat. Changed shops second deployment least would different location combine QA one work centers.

That special level misery. Yeah back partying next party hits poor spreading most. fairly well work home, teach kids home, etc etc etc. poor ones either send kids back face face school go hungry. see commercial 5 years now......""You may intitled......."" 56? Hm. bad, actually. expecting like hundreds cases due hundred person gathering. fecal transmission pathogen tricky confirm—and proving virus spreads via building waste pipes even difficult—it entirely possible, several researchers tell ScienceInsider. help, try answer key questions unusual still speculative risk. 

Ive strong advocate n95 butt masks / underwear while. wouldn’t show data quickly. There’ll lag 1-2 weeks spreading schools start showing up, whether testing people beginning show symptoms. Sweden fucked coronavirus everyone knows already. advice I'm right you. feeling powerlessness covid everything surrounding wrought. 

I get feeling inside of, ""What's point even?"" Roll out! test employees approved trial? thought article said emergency permission could wrong. Yeah shit Dude, guy literally tells he's foreigner China 🤣 . relatives marriage Shenzen I've China many times. Omg extent ppl's paranoia unbelievable. think everything propaganda matter evidence matter say.
Also check FoodRanger YouTube. He's food traveller decided live China showcase foods lives China. There's hundreds westerners like posting hundreds videos china YouTube. Please educate fooled whoever brainwashing  I’m from. It’s still less 5k. recall saying that.  Sweden sucks balls correct response coronavirus let sink in... XD Also everyone assuming things family unit know literally nothing lol. odds favor, risk it? think she'd love loves right.

Allow introduce conservative family. Needing right always important factor conversation. reason attempt contact trace.

It’s lot easier mayor governor tweet “#stayhome” call job done. That's sign good relationship (though hopefully listening side capitulating degree well). Personally, think weddings ceremonies incredibly overrated, own. Looks like IHME really banking winter horrifically profound effect still talk therapist every week lot easier fall PTSD flashbacks loop get head anxious depressing thoughts without places go, people see, social stimulation. Oh goes Minnesota, go go Bridezilla, live Maine. idiot coworker's idiot boyfriend went (even though pregnant) got there. Luckily get spread us. won't.

Seattle looks like 28 Days Later. Yeah. spike never was. apply mass gatherings? banned? 3 people actually attendees either caught that. Well feel tired demoralized. definitely *will* blame people say fuck use preventative measures vaccine available. want *anyone die* someone tired necessary protect people's lives.

It forever may seem way, everything prevent spread *shorten* duration lockdown. hipster

This fucking hilarious!!  I've heard many weddings like friendships ruined someone wedding party thinks brain concerns. ignoring every study linked inside like small scale study thing holding strawman disease affects weak, original position...... read synopsis book immediately ordered it. attended private schools 1-12. parents could afford blue-collar job salary. 90s early aughts K-8 $2k per year, $6.5, 9-12 $8k per year, $15. 

Working family salaries certainly increased amount. thing. Postponed whole year October 10 October 9, 2021. Makes sense point Aight bet. Seems really work short term. thought, marriage committing life another, ceremony, gathering, party, dress, etc. still get married license couple close friends family members. Sometimes people get busy planning wedding forget marriage. Anyone really wants marriage even pandemic. presented 55% patients developing neurological issues though finding extrapolated population level, can't based single small scale study even methodology impeccable. That's issue. turned /u/coldngrey pushing narrative around seriousness virus compared flu go back read exchange they're saying cannot present findings one study though statistics apply SARS-CoV-2 patients. meant use MarketWatch article kind summary findings different papers said instead quoting single statistic like that. Wedding insurance thing... D'oh. Silly me. haha...all various colorful addictions set right now. 

It's really nice excuse skip meetups, also made realize need go concerts parties, two things would normally fill anxiety ""Can't stop signal."" :) second that, fuck 'em know mean. paid cash first house (a foreclosure really bad shape) used $600 Toyota Tercel remodel it. could fit 12' boards three kitchen cabinets inside car took seats out. in-laws cared seeing much, would quarantine make feel comfortable. guess like much. they're completely selfish lie say, ""Oh yeah, gone anywhere! (except restaurant last week, hardware store yesterday, oh mother get hair done...)"" Well thats fucked. I'm sorry. much appreciated PSA: general flu vaccine. flu shot targets strains, this, prevent infection best 50% time. general flu vaccine, flu shot questionable best. 


If stay home COVID, that, also protect flu. worst case get flu COVID time, probably bad scene. Realistically however, risk employer treat infected COVID show symptoms. good. topic foremost importance humanity. It’s terrible comment. People Wuhan suffered greatly virus. put pasture. two get sick right beginning. caring patient. One orienting time.

We option N95 face shield PAPR. both. tend use PAPR I’m rooms longer periods time it’s comfortable. Man, totally forgot friendster! Anecdotal, little brothers (age 5 6) got sick week. required urgent care visits. protect little one. Lmao ok man. haven’t seen socialized seen anyone friend group six months. entire time stuck parents house 90% life confined bedroom. period time friends living life normal, gone different jobs, met different people, ended relationships started new ones, moved new apartments, etc. Sometimes become really panicked feel helpless feel like I’m left behind. Every time check phone there’s much shit development don’t know reached point deleted social media upsetting see people dumb knowing basically might well exist moment. know big deal probably sound spoiled idk im undergrad still feel like *RIGHT NOW* growing changing finding instead feel like I’ve slid far back stuck there. freedom fulfillment fucking high school. Idk ban people marry IQ lower 101 User name checks out. friends MySpace, lol. seriously, doubt it. Agreed completely. know past months scary, I'm sick tired click-baity articles peddling catastrophic scenario. parts media like cognitive process person major depressive disorder: everything horrible bad news automatically assumed special status, good news discounted. 


Like, one arguing we're fucking woods yet, 75% vaccines Phase III make finish line, 4 really promising candidates right now. There's case perfectly rational measured optimism. ... Sweden what? *eyeroll* safe? still trial stage. Trial approved masses. still great risks. purely supply/demand thing, also monitoring short-term effects vaccine first wave approving vaccine general population?  calling religious good way put since lot believe based faith, science

however, call pro-vaxxers religious reason diseases lifetime conditions follow covid19 scare people yet doesn't. It’s September two months decent weather ahead us. Let’s use outdoor dining get closer vaccine, instead playing dice resurgence closes everything back even longer. Maybe IQ Florida increase. Mmm...my guess they'll take pictures dead nana that's sad thought. like those. Well thank much! Obviously don’t realize New Mexico 47th state United States.  that’s ok, American educational system extremely racist, prejudicial complete failure I'm Vietnamese living here. Nothing like tour guide said. one force us lie outbreak. people spread fake news around. know illness CoVid, happen contradict number given Ministry Health. Many pro-Western people even imply way government control outbreak harsh: forcing quarantine, locking resident areas someone positive test result found. looking number assumption that, countries react pandemic stupid, incompetent way, Viet Nam to, see laughable.
Actually, see assumption ridiculous lying spreading here. lol Americans.... Man would great four vaccines approved. BOOM appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* work company maybe good idea safe take vaccine. Yup, way money, far less mind spirit. There's Lincoln Center, Chelsea, Columbia U, 4 distinct seasons Florida. 5,000 sq feet (god theses examples slay me) house instead 900 sq foot apartment. Every advantage bottom line money look prestige lower price. form learning disability? Sweden never nothing. BLM stands social justice. 

You went universal studios selfish reasons. 

/s specifically Oxford one? That's article talking about. There's vaccines started trials them. Add climate change, fuck depressing thing - started year fires Australia killing half wildlife, unprecedented heat waves, destruction Amazon... I’m subbed r/climate torture myself, guess. feel know (despite feeling probably powerless) 

The absolute necessity absolute impossibility consensus thanks Facebook, social media, Murdoch, Russian bots - *that* hard take

In middle contrasting you’ve got life personal problems, think “what’s point”. 

Like need work survive, take care parent, somehow fight climate change. Ok. Yeah sign petitions send emails representatives. else (as caregiver, obligations too). Somewhere mix goals left later, probably won’t ever chance achieve. that’s it.

Best distract tasks part. Problem can’t sleep anxiety spirals. Full article, pretty school graduates health workers protested Iraq's capital shortage equipment tackle COVID-19 - also lack cases risen record 5,000 new infections health ministry says hospitals overwhelmed rising numbers.

There's also two minute video someone ground  Mandate everyone purchase health insurance, sort like needing purchase car insurance.  Oh definitely have, that's called ""friend,"" original comment. think see and/or talk maybe twice year, that's far enough me. Maybe point single case misclassified death? good evidence spread outdoors (absent extremely crowded situations) rare. moving air makes difficult infect others, unless you’re close receive direct spray someone speaking sneezing. Masks still good, don’t panic spending time moving golf cart. someone went Catholic school spent lot time learning religions. debates subjects abortion (which course meant sides represented). taught birth control. really far bubble zealots. Yet hey, bother learning easily dismiss labeling something terrible.  Seriously though, people care potentially causing someone’s death extended illness?

No. ethnicities vaccine works on, better. phrase ""white"" vs ""non-white"" though. Yes. Yeah, agree. unfortunate part individual surrounded people agree COVID issue, affect them, word word God comes wedding. I've clinical depression long remember, always self destructive, suicidal type. It'd fairly well managed meds lifestyle changes years, bam, world goes shit. But... feel depressed? like always do, dark thoughts self hatred destruction.

No, came depressed surprise put symptoms together one afternoon. read like prescription tv commercial, ""Do lack energy, take joy interest hobbies anymore? trouble sleeping? Overeating? doom scroll feel hopeless future? depressed, poor fuck."" weird. zero desire end life: hate life around frustrated *tired*.

My psych another med, really, cannot medicate reality away.  Ikr?? 2 cousins. want assume meant one cousins married person considered cousin marriage therefore cousins.... ? Maybe? said covid real. reason think something special going Bangladesh? bound get range mutation rates sample multiple areas? need job, fine neither us working. gets boredom. Sadly, isn’t Minnesota. LOL. true pneumonia. Please stop hysterical nonsense. certain metrics hospitals reach certain capacity restrictions go place hospital metrics go certain level restrictions taken away. seesaw it? 

Also happened field hospitals deployed never used??? sorry, well-written expression feelings pain whole thing been, like reading passage novel really hits home something. Like said, worst part could've basically now, seen countries. especially hard live tourist destination we've legit record tourism... pandemic! Every day, weekends, like 4th July. people actually acting respectful following protocol would one thing, every time go loads people without masks crowding beach restaurants. time need get groceries cess pool. mention leave trash everywhere respect place live here. Lake Tahoe, one beautiful natural landscapes Earth, treat like toilet. “Normies” *barf*

I don’t fuck bars word nauseating sound condescending fuck. little intricate insults. like flu!  That's fair point. Says never intervened spite directly contradicting dictionary definition so. defines ""intervening"" something completely different says, ""This happen."" making really bad faith argument here. outside, though, aerosols hangin around tight space we, United States America, fail figure make PPE sufficient quantities protect healthcare frontline workers? definitely cranked anxiety 11 well. Omg!! wedding planned July. Cancelled it. Still dressed up, took pics friends/fam, celebration together day planned. plans wedding anytime soon. Honestly, looking kind financial drain either. Yet still happen vaccine get every year. virus mutates. Also like going safe anyway. Less chance maybe depending strain not. Cuentame uno de Pepito ahora. entire life ruined two years lockdown? i’ve seen dudes getting parole 20 years much better attitude. Bruh I’m like barely hanging thread job/income/life situation hasn’t even changed less here. consider casualty covid, like casualty stupidity face disaster. Please don’t dump lockdown skeptics anti maskers, consider negative effects lockdowns (not everyone get government aid) doesn’t mean conspiracy theorists, wear mask everywhere go. Yes, directly clearly possible. COVID-PLUS

COVID-PRO-MAX Perhaps revisit concept percentage. Increasing decreasing testing would change percentage assuming decent sample size. 

For example 10000 tests 100 positive cases that's 1% positivity rate. Likewise 1000 test 10 positive cases still 1% positivity rate. work?

(I mean, still good news) cousins marrying extremely common throughout world, common worldwide history... pointed dufuses understand needed beginning. one worst death rates world economy cratered. ""doing well."" voiced concerns friend still going forward destination (Mexico) wedding saying? It’s America, Europe too, guess everywhere... it’s majority people are, sadly. point, :yawn: pointed dufuses understand needed beginning. pointed dufuses understand needed beginning. first real great, novel pandemic (i.e. opposed regular flu season) mass tourism era, I'm hopeful combination vaccines basic precautions allow us get back normal there's chance Covid could long-lasting game-changer. live Maine, there's wedding happened Aig 7th 65 people (15 state mandate 50 people).

So far, 3 deaths linked it, caused related outbreaks nursing home prison, 147 infected total related one event. 

Think awful must couple feel. really worth risk. Banning doesn’t work though.

You still see subs unfortunately Yeah protests contribute spread. least that's page said smfh sounds like politics me. Defund Democrats fact open access baffles remember time number 51,000 would national total number one spot Worldometer leaderboard 100% attest fact states/counties blatantly ignoring metrics set local health departments. Schools reopening person 2 days. social distancing. Full classrooms. 5 days week. health department “strongly encouraged distance learning time”. district DGAF. It’s mandate they’re it. Masks mandated county school requiring them. That’s exactly read comment. company goes global medical crisis failure government.  Plenty. tell wear mask haven’t taking precautious before. 

Most clients 60-80 lmfao. one said shit. tell remove mask. Why? realize they’re worried it, it’s problem. Welcome America people let others normal despite issues. made of? Hopefully plastic (haha). first Coronavirus Bowl Game presented White House. Wow indeed... every stage state's reopening plan, we've moved forward without actually meeting metrics cited rules. So, yes that's exactly we're saying. Yep, Germans idea city London couple selfish people turned lamps could read newspaper night.

Actually, first bombing London civilians Germans World War II accident. Luftwaffe plane flew course: Maine: hold beer. could stop FGM First Cousins legally get married decent amount country south- one many reasons development process vaccine much faster. much much easier determine efficacy vaccine virus basically consuming massive regions entire world. get volunteers faster, going become clear much faster whether control group getting infected vaccinated group basically running virus every time leave house. Former Calgarian here, one sane going want eat outside, heated not, -40C (-40F) out. Still seems dead though. many people streets. state really, really well people decided wedding invite fucking everybody. That's point. 'when vaccine ready', rather 'if vaccine works'. Something like 80% vaccines reach stage 3 trials go pass.  Except ""one day event"", lifetime event. People go throwing around 10-15k random one day events.

That said, think wedding maybe $3k in. Free venue (church) pretty basic food 50 people. still fun still married 14 years later. Warm weather + transplant, tourism, development friendly political climate = expect lot new Florida men women. know shelter place didn’t work? idiots left homes. everyone nothing 2 weeks least, would virus! Nope. pointed dufuses understand needed beginning. Bars open here. Probably somewhere around 13 cases per 1,000 people. post removed because:

Pfizer's least didn’t go throating CDC yo saying they’re “unreliable source” facts changed away bias. (Ie sub) *play euchre Good lord indeed 😂. 

He jurisdiction that. even directly pressured vaccine makers. exact diction ""health officials"" nothing vaccine makers lol. article opinion piece said trump stood sidelines said hurry stomping feet. 

Where reason think trump say vaccine timeline? Please. burden proof you, making claims. proof? financial incentive? deals? Provide them. Lmao. Omg big yikes. work grocery store (Fry's/Kroger). workingn40 hours non stop since January, hazard pay like 2 months.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Yup, many people still think ""I'm racist cause I'm burning crosses."" Dead people already diagnosed covid without tests long time. What’s point testing you’ve already fucked statistics? Good riddance. Fuck school founded religious entity. know anybody 65+ interacts someone 65+ ever?  Given extensive global spread highly likely, bordering inevitable SARS-CoV-2 soon make way back bats animals host multiple similar coronaviruses, fortunately unable spread among humans. chimera SARS-CoV-2 like happens flu year, strain usually new zoonotic spillover.

The mutation rate within humans hardly serious risk need concerned with.  feel you. reaching gotten snaps exchanged, guess something invitations hangouts - whether person virtual. virtual hang outs start pandemic, friends moved house together stopped pretty much. 

I know, sure reach least they'll understand sure intending feel way whatnot, make feel good help mental health think this. I'll try reach soon something. 

My issue never felt sort anxiety depression level trouble articulating write, express feelings - double find way talk in-person. good place be, hopefully follow get better like you. least means vaccine pose danger human body, effective not. reminds college kids apartment building across saw passing bong back forth alllll 7 them, month ago. blinds open night watched em put dirty mouths over. Miami nonetheless, covid epicenter! stupid less likely sue side effects. I’m going wedding close family next month recently gathered courage tell bride personally. told hurt disappointed called paranoid. Guess what? normally don’t deal good kind drama, feel like weight lifted shoulders. sleep better even. don’t fucking care anymore family thinks this, know I’m right thing, keeping safe, everything else. Nothing important. hope find courage don’t see dragged dangerous selfish event. really bad. many people including seem slowly sinking despair feels like theres bottom it. I'm WA state.

While visiting in-laws see tourists CA, FL, IA etc.

It over.

The people spoken. cares. fine large tables still laughing drinking yelling, absolutely. see list businesses fined city. Nearly every major joint fines much capacity, many table, masks required, it’s Wild West here. mean Texas yeah Weddings &amp; ceremonies, sure. original comment said “married” bestows whole bunch additional benefits. Immediately head (from US perspective) ability join other’s health insurance one lose employment &amp; benefits pandemic.

A lot people forget there’s marriage ring party Lol that's quite sensationally editorializing title got there. 

Actual title byline whoever County emerges hotspot coronavirus**	 state hosted summer tourism season smoothly, defiant pastor wedding party officiated created unwelcome surge. commenter, limited number tests, absolutely correct. want know bad really is, doesn’t really make difference don’t catch every case fact. make difference testing people alive isolated cared for. Infinitely important. you, mind asking? People lot non refundable money tied weddings. Maybe even years salary. Tough call canceling. Stop impairing ability make living. Open businesses let people decide fate. Worst-case scenario updating vaccines include new clades take every year like flu vaccine. Stop vaccines social distancing FOREVER dooming nonsense. doubt it; live beach town, everyone always beach. Locals pretty good isolating (no masks) small, spread groups, tourist-y.. tourists give shit. We're poor state, tourism important economy.

But really seeing lot folk general wearing masks, even isolate time seems.. ill advised.

So even though cases slight downward trend, imagine shoot Labor Day (within two weeks, anyway). ugh. government cares economy, it’s clear that’s true, would stupid make free dirt cheap study POSSIBLY shown increase coronavirus infections flu shot.

Also, increase 5% unvaccinated ground 7% vaccinated group. That's well within margin statistical error.

This paper literally zero evidence shows flu shot makes susceptible coronaviruses. whole point paper find vaccine interference, find evidence coronavirus thing moot. soooo good. keeps getting crazier crazier. one proposes herd immunity happen low - cell thing prior exposure corona viruses. NYC herd immunity via cells , would COVID epidemic people stupid? information. Seriously, disgusted US citizens. selfishness, self centered “freedom” lovers bored COVID ignore it. virus actual high mortality rate ever happens number deaths staggering. like we're pretending age, smoking obesity common enough co-morbidities us worry about. clearest ""fuck em, got mine"" i've ever seen lmao. past months explained lot species tbh. NYC area friends know people died pretty cautious imagine majority handling things. live enough people know people who’ve infected it’s bit free all! scientists r/COVID19 pretty convinced vaccine solve problem mutations covered vaccine update clades vaccines come out. novel virus, also thing going cripple us forever. friend state says people following guidelines, wear masks, etc. anyone confirm? Yeah, wait right? Latest estimates another 200,000 people dying end year. want rush things worry 1/10,000 people getting narcolepsy. everything Vietnam's believable example, IMHE model also predicts China 11k covid deaths end year

IHME bit misunderstood. media pitches forecast -- model probable future. not. tool decision making. variables, one mobility. look last graph see IHME model predicts happen China _conpletely opens_. models basically always assumption. people call model ""reasonable worst case scenario"" reason.

In case, another outbreak China know can't keep opening. need look IHME model. already know future outbreak looks like. lockdown.

The model useful places. Like maybe Florida consider thinking open when. also shows scenario 95 percent mask compliance maybe look at.

Right model website FAQ Update Notes link explain model developed intended used. intended predict likely future often gets much hate. I’m kind right exceptions. yeah guy who's going make lot money forcing us reopen told there's nothing worry about, know, guy whose kids privately tutored, guy seen bus last thirty years guy get access world class medical treatment planet drop hat

so yknow, two sides man two sides... Canada anyone made $5k past year eligible CERB 🤙 would great 4 free. can't wait burn entire pay check one. learning antibody tests done undercount they're typically including t-cells? California back June yielded disastrous results set state back three months’ worth progress containing virus. better vaccine natural immunity. Everything else pipe dream. Plus Im fairly certain companies making vaccines would given immunity lawsuits. also lot cheaper run trials Brazil. “We best tasting” Lockdowns negative effects super necessary right now. many people call it, necessary evil. Jokes him, Missouri COVID cases China Absolutely. 100% positivity rate would clear indication there's people population infected catching testing need tests figure actual rate is. much related work lose tons money heard today everything crossed. 21 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday Listen, know what’s good life. It’s place tell others what’s good life don’t know either. know me, need accomplish great things life worthless waste breath. prevented so, choice kick bucket. That’s I’m worried lockdown. continues, destroy cause become mediocre, can’t afford. want prove worth, must became anything mediocre. *if symptoms.

Perhaps naive plight Hong Kong Muslim population. least 1 million Muslim minority Uighurs held Chinese government-run detention centers stoning adulterers. Times changed lol ""Herd immunity"" would mean several MILLION dead Americans, even possible. know, math hard Drumpers. This, point running different vaccine simultaneously always backup plan. Well looks like know it’s like living America now, yet you’d think they’d worse richest country world, nope.....we money can’t figure use knock covid idiots. #We're snow flakes, yet pussies can't deal near fellow Americans. Nice one. Yeah, there’s really good reasons buy companion animal. Obviously specific purposes makes sense buy, case dog much tool friend. (IE there’s lot herding mutts, instinct needed work livestock, pedigree may work sheep worth damn love ducks/geese, etc cases, working line breeders identify puppies well sell take time match dogs people’s needs.)

If you’re going buy, absolutely buy breeders purpose desire help grow breed, make money puppies. definitely get companion animal breeders create working animals. all, lab afraid gunshots, Aussie ignores livestock, terrier can’t figure dig need homes too, they’re breeders actively work remove genetic issues like hip dysplasia breeds.

Unlike breeders make money dogs. lockdown even harsh. would sit inside reading, watching tv, talking phone texting, yoga, etc. could find things entertain stay touch, knowing would safe 6 weeks would together again. like bubonic plague hundreds years ago nobody knew worked way spread information communicate friends family. Wait youre telling leader thats created divisive shitstorms brewing publicly announced untrue claim? Nah wouldnt happen... Darwin good man surgical mask alright? See lot available amazon, sure difference efficacy. Exactly. want feel rage think wedding go Facebook page “Mask America” 🤦🏼‍♀️🥴😑 fuck plague rats. Florida? get one vaccine would stop getting other? three? reason would get excited low positivity rate means less people getting infected.

A low positive rate also good indication test numbers good approximation true infection rate. Early positivity rates 15-20%+ higher meant undertesting therefore trending positive cases misleading. Reading comprehension isn’t big deal eh? Ok. Sure China. Sounds good. Bye. bad news. respiratory diseases ever ""defeated"" nonpharmacologic intervention. sounds arkansas Lol, like... pilfered? 2 outcomes disease, know binary die don't? Used work well too. Fantastic made laugh hard, feel bad.

i remember first day internet Well like everything else pandemic, herd immunity politicized co-opted meaning warped talk people really don’t know talking about.

What described herd resistance...but people usually told don’t know means. yeah everywhere seen pandemic rages control UNLESS strong government citizen response, reaches 20% stabilizes minimal restrictions. That's thought well. aunt said mask matches dress perfectly comfy, hopefully she'll actually wear it. even drove another city pick PERFECT fabric store order online. 

I even charge aunt. want people wear damn mask spread plague. fucking hate everything world right throwing free masks friends family makes feel like I'm making small difference. Happening California too. people, yes. Don’t forget state income estate taxes. like shut mouth ""Herd immunity"" exists all, would mean MILLIONS dead Americans. fucking toad. Happening California Yes. wonder would classify moderate side effects? Never meant make daughter cry Covid symptoms began end Feb went whole month March. never needed go hospital, wasn’t mayyybe 3 weeks ago felt like chest tightness finally subsided could take full breath daily basis. 

Fingers crossed said loud, pendulum doesn’t swing back breathing goes shit again. I’m sad. buddy moved away COVID COVID-19 makes us isolated anyway. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I’m frustrated governors allowing happen 🤦🏼‍♀️ Yeah like... patio building man amazes people post hard proof revelry social media somehow expect entire world (and te university) immediately find Tells much care society... Grandma, The. Maine 15 new cases reported today still well. Maine also one least religious states nut jobs making news still small minority. think ""pilfered"" means think does. Maine stolen I'm sure holds high value.  gf tested positive COVID antibodies donated blood. paperwork came back saying double tested antibodies every time. 

So stand reason asymptomatic carrier considering infectious nature virus? never got symptoms never developed weeks followed exposure subsequent time spent together after. Nah can't look hospitalizations means people panic much first comment deleted thought OP.
It seems misunderstood around here, many ""you"" ""this, that"".
True, comprehension terrible start get lost. It’s Jared’s PPE  here, hazard pay ended june. Oh hi, cat also diagnosed cancer. 

A treatable kind, he’s miserable it’s nightmare don’t know I’m right thing going treatment.

All say, even normal 2020 cocktail meds isn’t helping much.   Thanks really helped! What’s favorite part? gotta add analogy would better suited leader refused take action, cabinet forced lights stay local leadership fought turn lights off. 

Or words: screwed start. Therapy, baby. ^^^ spent hundreds words trying justify small gatherings risk large gatherings fit politics even though know damn well makes sense. typically known useful idiot. 😂 teach outside Florida ?? I’ll pass.  see difference urgency protesting human rights urgency big party wedding, dumber bag rocks. one risk must taken. other, much. posting model states, knows happen $4 per year sounds like good deal 5+ months since I've seen friends. walked beyond one square mile radius home. 

I feel like I'm stuck open air prison.   can't decide one worse

If can't figure pre-meditated attack much much worse implication, can't help you, friend. Similar situation me. new-ish relationship started, see eye eye covid all. wanted take cautious approach basically acting like big deal. Things kind fizzled went separate ways, months ago feels like there's zero opportunity dating right now. Nobody really even speaks public anymore, least live, feel like anyone who's dating app right kind red flag shit happening lol, like girls probably also pretty much ignoring pandemic...? Shit sucks. body count? Viruses actually care ultimate outcome disease. SARS-CoV-2 evolved spread twice readily asymptomatic contagious transmissible period, time become 10 time lethal 3 weeks later, would become new dominant clade. spreads 6 people instead 3, care die not.

What happens though human immune system retains cross reactive antibodies prior strains therefore future infections become less severe. 1918 influenza became seasonal influenza, also 2009 pandemic influenza big deal everyone alive 1957 cross reactive immunity. also diseases deadly naive immune systems Native promising research long lasting immune response memory cells immune system. Suggesting immunity lasts years come. Quite contrary Coronaviruses.

We years experience virus, evidence immunity lasts years. We're starting see proven reinfections ~6 months lower bound observed seasonal coronaviruses well. Great finally stop saying Sweden fucked up? Social creatures practice social distancing negative mental health results? Color shocked. Depression rates shitter already. Profit people every turn. know heart failure one, that's new one

So comorbidity fear getting virus stay home, go out, quarantine yourself. again, care people lost homes, businesses, jobs lives, want stomp peoples freedoms keep getting hand outs government IMHE model trash cant even get USA correct - much less country large india data accuracy problems. says Great Depression. gonna great see taxes used benefit people pay them. care state funds, national funds, funds unwillingly exposed legal activists fact. Anyone got sick wedding illegally held personally held responsible well.

A free nation isn’t without consequences bad actors good actors shouldn’t responsible bluntly break law. wedding actually protest OK  _you get fucking deserve_ ""How know student Wuhan Chinese? camera spoke english well.""

You tell Chinese. said, think lose job stupid joke though. I'd interested find actual student thought comment, guess probably care. someone else getting offended behalf. GA shit job hand dealt. early states misfortune vulnerable populations hit hard federal government lied containment screwed up,testing month whilemit spread silently. months prepare, actual testing, better treatments, fact they're still going let 8000 people die Nov horrendous. Ok protests 10s thousands people. Harvesting effect makes much sense we've decided do! got engaged Christmas morning, wanted specific date, never wanted big to-do. COVID perfect excuse us go courthouse. I'm looking forward guilt-free experience, big party honeymoon vaccines come out.

Congratulations, btw! White House came right start announced virus real, also provide help states fast testing support lock downs occured. This, instead months President saying virus hoax make look bad telling citizens states like Michigan protest resist safety guidelines. wonder portion population take pandemic seriously, getting infected spreading infection others. Stupidity, like virus, contagious. state ""red"" anymore, think I'll continue self-imposed isolation copious mask usage since lot folks around refuse wear them, despite us extended mask mandate place.

Well Belgium actually that, test people died seemingly unrelated deaths too, one reasons numbers high.

California , orange county July. Yeah death rate actually 18% maybe nowhere near depressing part (to me) fucking ignorance country displayed shit show.... 

Cant see damn rona post without dumbass political... trust source Gov't media... rest country wants hate Trump this, yet trust hypocrite Fauci media goons... depresses fuck outta me

people CANNOT **CANNOT** read article 2 draw conclusions (then still want believe thats fine, ""cool"" fine) much pettier things sheeple leach onto without attention whoring rest us thinking same. way could catch flu bimonthly grocery pickup worker wearing masks.I'll take chances. like would understand never signed anything, college took money.

Is proportionate though? suspect real option signing, signing mean they're kept stricter standard everybody else feel sorry them. Either way, tragedy, imo. :/ That's VPNs work. Private VPNs can't 'filtered', they're either 'on' 'off'. get exactly internet Hong Konger American Singaporean Japanese person. 

They're blocked every now-and-again days, rest time they're normal.

I friends family home talk too, plus various friends *have* home returned China, including got back past weeks. makes upset. much, community, seeing uptick cases. Mostly one saw reason keep distancing masks one got sick first time. exactly? people chose attend. Nobody forced anyone go Marvelous. It’s straight propaganda people eat lol realize I've lost multiple people 60-85 underlying conditions. Save fake preaching someone else.

The comorbidity statement apply older ages either. “56 start first level transmission. far far far more” — Science Link. could true. 

All said find odd NY what...3x higher death rate GA we're praising NY giving GA shit?

GA remained much open fraction deaths? look countries like US, mortality still higher even assume everyone country virus. #I DONT GET SCIENCE


#I TOOL

#I IDIOT think ridiculous reporting actual number positive cases. Roll out? They're even done giving full treatment test group study efficacy. really sounds like joke me. also totally see people's feeling got hurt.

It pretty sad currently political climate makes everyone defensive now. never, stupid fucks like above. what’s said, think realistically it’s matter when, if. That's Facebook is...

This kind stuff going since creation... can't lockdowns mostly economy, tbh, excuse best protect vulnerable much can. deserve live too. sounds almost identical set up. Grandma zoomed in, everyone else got tested quarantined. immediate family two friend couples! would rather lose money risk anyone party becomin ill possibly dying Lol backward fucken americans. Yes this. Combined widespread testing capturing mild cases also reduce overall death rate Wrong way around actually.

There's evidence recombination influenza, instead swaps genetic material reassortment only. H1 envelope protein 2009 H1N1 descendant 1918 envelope protein. N1 though came entirely swine origin. PA PB2 genes entirely avian origin.

Coronaviruses swap genetic material recombination, organisms infections multiple coronaviruses lead ""gene splicing"" fragments different virus strains. One problems determining origin SARS-CoV-2 formed kind recombination event like this, there's clean signal one gene virus A, one gene virus B. actually mutates lot readily way influenza (when multiple co-infections organism genetic swapping occurs).

There's course also mutating occurs virus infects organism influenza proof reading machinery evolves faster SARS-CoV-2 does. much common form mutation. right. However, SARS-CoV-2 mutate much slower influenza (I can't recall offhand, looked awhile back like factor 2 3 slower). Really kind mutation governs new serotypes emerge long takes epidemics virus -- recombination/reassortment events triggers new pandemic spread. wrong comparison influenza vis vis recombination/reassortment also wrong important thing consider new epidemic spread, kinds cancels out. remains mutates somewhat slower influenza.

You also correct variants SARS-CoV-2 thus far cross react antibodies see emergence new serotypes SARS-CoV-2 eventually cross react antibodies.

We also expect immunity short lived based similarity seasonal would probably good eradicate SARS-CoV-2 much possible eliminate possibility recombination producing new pandemic. would likely require everyone world getting vaccinated given year.

It'll probably remain seasonal coronavirus. Unless there's one recombination events though start look like seasonal coronaviruses less like mess -- like 1918 pandemic started nightmare evolved seasonal influenza. referring Australian press? Ranked 26th 180 countries [Press Freedom US 45th. China? 177th. 180. forgive believing anything coming Chinese press. doesnt know shit he's dimwit lawyer. child. THATS lawyer?! LMFAO!! can't decide one worse: pre-meditated attack implies sinister intentions, off-the-cuff moment implies jokes flying mouth casually.

Also, expending one students butt joke definitely OK. incites bullying anti-China rhetoric already surplus days.

Imagine said something like ""For next assignment, redesign father's workplace... &lt;insert black student's case, redesign jail lol"". fired would least concerns. people buy lotto ticket ""you never know"" Strange didn’t know ending, anywhere near matter That's poor response. 100% false. CMS ordered nursing homes include deaths count result, higher state's count. yadda yadda yadda, really great day, right? ;) don’t care spend even portion trying convince others live lives. worry yourself. thing control world. much recycling done Phase III data disappointing. Spain, Netherlands France highway down. rheir people stopped going last heard. super harsh restrictions, people taking precautions. Ok description virologist Robert Garry, PhD, team researchers analyzed genome sequence novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus found evidence virus made laboratory otherwise engineered.

This opposite original statement: [virus created post wrong video? 2020 Olympics Ugh that’s extended family T. say stuff like “For *brave* world, large family reunion next week! Xoxo” like gtfoh y’all asking get sick  Well guess it’s clear then: lockdowns bullshit. TX never fell 10k free beds. 10 thousand. fair point. friend fighting refund wedding even though allowed number guests far less originally agreed everyone seated entire time etc.

I understand wedding organisers breach original agreements. opened indoor dining, gyms, theaters. last holdout, Murphy fire restaurants finally caved. family (two kids husband MiL) got sick. mil could hardly breath weeks. husband kids sick, still really sick, long time, ended pneumonia compromised immune system, get bed like three weeks, still tired sickly feeling. every single one residual cough June. scary, kept making jokes ""the beer virus"" cause Wuhan point far people knew. (I know, fatalistic dark sense humor especially 104 fever lol. dumb joke) really wonder did. MIL got tested influenza came back negative. Even so, would likely easily catch again, mention it, would never want responsible someone else getting sick. understand mindset people like this. needs/wants matter. New York count nursing homes death happen outside nursing home. clear attempt manipulate data look bad. 

I think every single state (I could wrong) counts anybody LTC dies LTC death. New York admitted hospital die longer LTC death. father reason thinks fantastic people pay insurance ""don't need to"".

I tried explain accept it.  three people died even go wedding worst part. mean Florida Governor. even scientists taking ""DIY vaccines"". suppose compared DIY vaccine, something made actual pharmaceutical company probably safer. haven’t even second wave yet. Last month, mom group follow Facebook, lady confirmed infection talking lying form kids daycare, didn’t fever, even though positive, couldn’t breathe mask left Walmart wearing one. Almost every comment like go, girl!

How know student Wuhan Chinese? camera spoke english well.

The comment made Wuhan, original epicenter coronavirus, student Chinese. many boats sank Lake Travis? That's nice thing facts... they're true even believe them! also winnie pooh bar tieba (kind like subreddits...) people say anything. Eat inside yelling, loud talking, singing. fine. God, conservatives cant even read forfeit still loss. Bride's dress breath-taking. here? too. I’m bad mentally. Basketball helped lot, feel non existent point. feel weightless. anxious, overthink everything. feel genuinely like I’m going crazy. Idk what’s going man. Setting therapist tomorrow hopefully. Well, obviously us Canadians tough, but... would go eat patio -25°C could take food home eat room temperature? Well think someone's gotta reevaluate gonna take coronavirus over.

Because bad news waiting 100% compliance 330 million people. Multiple truths? 

You drunk? it’s uncommon either. isn’t good. really say asthma poorly controlled moderate-to-severe asthma *might* higher still better risk though! many deaths? wedding back July. table set sat people live people share close space regular basis. Every person required wear mask away table, including cocktail hour. serving staff wife followed rules. Zero complaints, zero coronavirus cases. I'm interested, source first statement 6% false? Actually, ""65% either overweight obese"" actually close actual US average adults. believe actually around 71% US adults age 20 up. Gee wonder why? Could told stay home susceptible. Could six months we've rely others get food medication. Could see countries squashed flat able go freely enjoy life yet counts continue rise selfish people incompetent government. Could much need physical hug. Could long actual human next us video chat goes far. Could knowing called friends family members care enough wear mask despite knowing become infected likely die. Could can't even get counseling therapy except thru hot line small bandaid huge heartbreak. 

The depressed ones us keep wearing masks keep safe despite ever decreasing odds flattening virus. depressed ones us watch everyone spread virus knowing nothing do.  sucks. strictly lockdown everybody knew. awkward first establish rules people never shit first place really mostly anxiety. Everybody good distance bit. like think rubbed bit to. They'll think ""at least got see wearing white dress died. Given situation, would've contracted somewhere else anyway"". read three body problem, sci fi series. world many agree lol Winnie Pooh ban dumb, can't believe many people think true.

Isn't still Winnie Pooh ride Shanghai's Disneyland? really hope. feel like future screwed watch. want damn thing want academic opportunity come back. don’t want part lost generation. don’t become want become due whole shitstorm, I’ll love rest life resentment. vaccination. Whatever open what'll open. old argument. Probably nice bikes showing estate sales. ... yeah fuck poor brown kids.

Phrasing! suck. Sacrificing Isolating months end also suck. can’t expect people apart forever. Ah, yeah that's major difference... 8k new cases 17 new deaths day huge absolutely stupid thing say. Look every democracy democratic republic Earth. Way better US, par better China.  able live life livelihood?

I say stay in. Wear mask stay hell away people. That's it... hard.

Shutdown thing right now...quit arguing argument April. mean, kill everything? That's fix way.... first bout depression 7 8 years Starting June. Still recovering, though think(hope) I’m side worst it. 

Absolutely think covid played huge role. seems completely unsurprising. joke make ok ""current political climate"" called making fun people like dumb high schooler. called bully big issue many years now. interfering. offered type tangible incentive purposely mislead data speed vaccine ready would interference.

Lol, wut?

Interfere - interpose intervene particular source he's annoying checking lot. That's going speed vaccine, ready ready. mutually exclusive, there's proof incentive push ready.

That's says. said he's pressing health officials. country in? know places took seriously like NYC, am, tell, states, one locked inside, anything close it. Using words 'lockdown' 'quarantine' describe anything that's happened America past 6 months nothing hyperbole. Nah, Buffet. America track 400,000 deaths years end, wars you’ve fought closing quick civil war. thought lot would anything country! I'm surprised. never depressed life. I've survived truly horrifying things parent pandemic tops all. constant wildfires helping either. feel trapped

 think I'll finally lose baby weight even enjoy food anymore.  Man. takin flu shot like wussy. stop spread virus contagious COVID-19? Won’t almost everyone catch anyway unless quarantine forever? enough Calgary fall winter, unfortunately. might get us weeks October, we're lucky. Soon = several funerals? imagine trying politicize virus, lol. doesn’t give solid shit cheer for. They're Facebook. Good 

We need less dumbass zealots country. Let's take argument effectiveness run it.

Say vaccine 75% effective. great, terrible. Miserable standards. However, compare masks, I'd say reached mask usage among 75% population yet. Vaccines effective mask. chance forgetting home wearing poorly. Masks plus vaccines result ending pandemic, high effectiveness not. trust Fauci this. even predicts 2020 vaccine approval. truths lol depends live. public schools **that** bad. 

But live district bad... surely would cheaper save 20k year per child move better district?  yet course r/coronavirus upvoted it. headline? love Well virus hot political topic. presidents job enforce effective strategies mitigate it. political sense. president would want vaccine ready, mean gunna happen. scientists political motivation. 38500 military got infected... supposed highly-trained, highly-funded, high-disciplined soldiers world supposed strike fear enemy hearts? really interesting! type food serve? kind adjustments make? What’s difference you’re now? you’re already isolated, matter I’m not? It’s selfish want hundreds millions healthy people stay inside sake. really good way put it. situation like make someone POS lose career, poor lapse judgement bad attempt make joke. republicans ignorant enough take offense word like “nuance,” don’t understand bills typically get pork added onto them, making less desirable. Religion lol 1000 dead every day. enough? Seems like problem. Good lord. insurance, typically free correct pharmacy. ask insurance company call pharmacy find free. insurance medicaid (which covers vaccines) bigger problems $40 dollar shot. 🤷‍♂️ far away effective non vaccine treatments? racist Good news **Sep. 7, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

The virus political. response is.  professional sports players

""According 2015 poll conducted jointly NPR, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Harvard School Public Health, quarter U.S. parents high-school children play sport hope they'll make pros. among families incomes $50,000, percentage nearly 40 percent.""

In actuality generally less 0.01% high school athletes make pro, majority play minor leagues feeder teams never see top levels. want come back something, right? Even ready October, way justify meeting labor day? vaccine, cure. never depressed ever life, always introverted. Coronavirus made realize Ive missed making lot great memories years introvert way live. kind caused feelings depression reflect back. 

Positive done better outlook life cant wait get there. Feel like virus lockdowns made see light ways improve going forward.  no. Selfish pricks. got vaccine Thursday. feel totally fine. every year, though. I've never sick flu shot. Wait, aunts, uncles grandmother went burning man?!? number newly confirmed cases Sunday drop record 1,094 new cases reported Friday comes health officials said they’re worried possibility outbreak growing Labor Day weekend.

Bars open packed, outbreaks spreading college/university campuses surprisingly, decent percentage people wearing masks. all, unfortunately, put tables masks hand sanitiser. people eating, dancing, drinking alcohol, kids running around.. me, recipe disaster. afaik cases linked events yet. possibility asymptomatic infections, impossible tell. especially case outbreak maine, think was, three people died even attend wedding. fucked people could selfish irresponsible.

surprising nobody, almost events connected certain offshoot conservative christianity, god side guess ? Cool cancel wedding. 30k. U sending Venmo? Yeah pretty much able, try diet change. Limit sugar carbs.

 reason survived become Dr. 200% positive things would turned way gone drug infested local HS mom nurse, hyperbole. reporting would make seem way. damn fine reason question reporting, cases rise 22 states.  technically eradicated trace cases outside travelers isolated them. chose still get married day October, smaller, intimate group. mother doesn’t understand brothers (both late 60s early 70s) aren’t invited. much easier decision make thought would be, honest. True, might well inside there's ventilation tent. Lol bunch dumb fucking idiots Medical racism boat friend, grad total boomer, didn’t even celebrate thought going to

Fuck year  forgot /s many deaths? Fantastic. WORST ""investment"" could ever make. I'm depressed two months idiots keep thing going. I'm actually pretty pissed we're still thing. We've 100 years figure control pandemic we've turned face masks something political. Instead going scientific consensus working together we've done opposite. 

Any face mask requirement basically like ""Do enter unless 18"" porn sites. really enforced. mean back Trump looked bad things going Europe refused block travel Europe? Nope, US never wonder way made money. never acts like big self made man like billionaires do, he's blue blood, comes upper middle class background. distinction self made billionaires, made money investing rather starting company, creating revolutionary product, making money way. lot tech wizards like end complexes feel important. course, people old money also often feel important, least, feel need spend lot finery impress others. 

Where lives might also factor. grew west, region super rich lot new millionaires like west coast, old money like east coast. might ever felt need compete rich people flaunting wealth, comes place many wealthy people flaunt to. Yes. Stop licking damned thing. go! Politicians way irrelevant topic. Bill gates evil leader lizard people don’t know you’re talking can't honestly tell Washington well never particularly hit us hard (comparatively speaking) we've getting lucky people generally careful. daily lives largely going pre-Covid places go see people least making attempts, begrudgingly, staying safe.

I hope stay good side things either way. can't even imagine things states getting hit worse.  see difference urgency protesting human rights urgency big party wedding, dumber bag rocks. one risk must taken. other, much.

I told April May risking health issue. issue could unknowingly infect someone else. Others put risk actions, get choice. killing grandma.

With logic, get choice either scenario - whether get protestor wedding goer.

As someone works maskless public, way knowing been. take solace thinking got well meaning protestor feel angered got selfish wedding guest? anyone tell difference modern Pfizer oxford vaccines are? ride OSU campus weekends check things out. 

It looks normal, like typical fall weekend central Ohio. 

It’s concerning. 

Go...cough...Bucks! see rate transmission 2? Everywhere read states 1.05 today. Increasing 2 short amount time would alarming, think case. Fairly likely.

The big question production distribution world wide level. friend delayed october wedding back beginning April. remember thinking premature would probably done then, naive. wish choice... accurate least class sizes smaller based excessive amount homeschooling. Wtf wife paperwork thing only. Want big bash? Wait till later. saying countries need lock back down? governor keeps saying “we’re headed right direction.” 🙃 lot bars, reopened next year there's bars people want go eat can't. Like what? flu death rate less common flu gets passed around ... Even family past couple years really started turn off. I’m family oriented person absolutely loves family, including extended family. seems like even communicate absolutely need something. transformed seemingly overnight couple years ago never drama preceding it. sure happened it’s pretty clear something happened around then! live anymore grew town, well still town. grandmother Greenwood nursing home died April. even get visit say goodbye fear possibly bringing virus facility. someone like piece shit causes actual outbreak encourages people disregard safety health others... disgusting. ""You thought sweet?!"" great book! Scifi social commentary level I've never read before. difficulty controlling viral outbreak driven per capita cases. 

Whenever see sentiments, automatically think ""math hard"" apparently Chinese understands math freaking GROWTH instead temporary sums. JFC. Bars cannot open unless hit state metrics based cases cited states health directors. saying states met metric laid health departments? Except...laws... rules society. 

If like opt out........well sort many people wanting wear mask social distance many countries would take right now.

Society means follow rules regulations. live hear...you agreed USA terms service. want see data chronic symptoms. Ie, many months common lingering issue. Could graph % chronic # months ‘recovered’. Ideally yes. farts? vaccine requires dry ice shipping? People sub like.. would happy kept country closed forever please. Damn, sounds frustrating. Sometimes feels like doctors base individual care statistics instead actually listening patient. totally understand X common cause Y, I'm sitting front telling I've Z past pretty sure Z, fucking listen me?? lol

Also, really want kids soonish terrified PPD. almost positive befall bad, bad time. come PP anxiety long last? Calgarian too, many bar patios natural gas feeding heaters, pandemic rarely used. time fire up. depressedded since nov 2016. Getting pretty used it. Hoping relief months! Pure sinophobia. plenty criticize China about... Workers company signing accounts safe, phase 3 vaccine trial one them. There’s great thread /r/covid19 Bangladesh hit herd immunity 31%. Mostly due age. Give looksies sister high school teacher specialises troubled children. supplying masks, sanitizer gloves kid wants that's much do. genuinely worried her. That's Saturday Sunday combined, btw So, ate lot restaurants BLM protests, you? shared lot public bathrooms? way used false. way everyone using false. 

They know I'm saying...this social media...we conform byebuybuy's rules posting. happens technology defeats purpose natural selection. decades slowly devolve species gene pools tainted traits normally would sorted now. People opinion validated online within seconds. matter sick twisted are, group people accept you. end Information Age. Right par (slightly, negligibly, more) same-experienced public school teachers area... teachers work tend cut average work environment benefits (generous PD budget, etc). Right! Even Australia didn’t feel far enough away people Silly fools.. Still save 400k could lose winter, humidity drops virus spreads much easily.  saying ignore it? 

Have 60% people shut ignore pandemic (guess 60%of buying power locked away spending entertainment centric economy going issues have.)

I fully understand numbers...stats... economist probably get better most. economy doomed heavily service\entertainment based. thing sped pushed cliff. I'm anti masker, honestly theres way transmission sources wedding air droplet transmission. think surfaces food, close contact, etc. even mask chances touching contaminated surface contaminating mask taking huge.  guess forgot mention earlier comment.... depression caused willfully ignorant assholes allow educated .... know , ones like look death rate apparently think 180,000+ ok consider long term affects. throws claim help third world citizens fact do... detriment homeless starving. need new dust filter Hoover MaxExtract PressurePro model 60. worked really well last time. That’s part seems hurt most. It’s knowing can’t even travel far enough escape insanity! sad. Al chile dices puras mamadas compa doubt lost generation. think separation church state America becoming authoritarian/fascist?

Really?! whole 'let's tear gas peaceful protestors' thing?  Ok, kiddo. know Rockies mean jack Coasties, 'cause rich people rights. never really ""effective medication"". We've gotten better we've learned lot, unrealistic think we'll ever develop medication prevents deaths. flu cold viruses (includin coronaviruses). That's need vaccine.  Senegal accurate 24 hour tests?! WTF? don’t parties lol. Concerts yes! would likely go alone haha Incredible progress coming back utter disaster. Keep NY! 💕 

When hear stuff coming you, think: fight option worse 

How powerful lobbies, little time - idk. 

I liked extinction rebellion damaged Murdoch’s printing presses it’s small dent, kind vanity... 

It’s web - fight ideologies tech playground, involve law move quickly Maybe.. call 'straw men.' can't defend position actual statistics, e.g., originally asked for, decide change argument asking, ""Why hate protestors?"" 

Fine: I'm group decides put others risk. 

Viruses noble, sweety. Go back school. hope reported violating quarantine. crime states. cousin 150+ person grad party Minnesota August. They’re anti-maskers. immediate family 4 decided go. haven’t talked us since. Nice. Less one member according death rate. NYC highest death rates city. people think NYC success? Selfish scum I'm leftist, keep guns bc righties literally salivating thought killing liburuls anteefa Older folks often respond much worse vaccines ( vaccines less effective them). high dose flu vaccine 65. definitely need vaccinate health care workers retirement homes  used come Reddit memes keep date current events. 

It used great sharing breaking news people HOURS evening news, 24/be news cycle LOT answer too. entertainment now, news. 

Now Reddit cesspool misinformation polarization. Pick echo chamber kids!

That said, I've recently deleted app phone several times, I'm addicted sweet sweet dopamine hits gives me. know people upvoting this. sound like representative sample hospitalized COVID patients. missing statement reply was. Monday email obtained BuzzFeed News, university cited FBI cautioned “threatening mail sent COVID-19 researchers east coast” containing “unknown substance” bureau testing determine hazardous. email, sent 500 researchers biological sciences, advised staff watch suspect packages, including “oily stains, discoloration, strange odor.” cool. I'm really glad work right now. Sir Wendy’s Yes, fuck them. Idiotic politicians pandering they're willing play role martyr.

There's infinite number solutions could implemented make opening bars safe. want hear em. Going work FEEL overall bad vibes air. palpable getting worse. really underutilizing valuable strategy. fairly cheap do, would think makes attractive cash-strapped public health departments Right. People read headline act like says “56 deaths”. It’s cases, odds are, people zero symptoms mild symptoms. He’s record saying doesn’t want live country dependent parents are. favors significantly higher estate taxes.

He gave kids education house (as far remember), turned 50 gave 5 Billion each—to give away, keep. he's lawyer...doesn't mean CANT harass people -_- Everything except bars NTA body, health, rules. Hey everyone, stay home remotely contact friends rest year. shit healthy going party someone Covid. People wanna live lives, shut ins afraid disease people handle quite easily. introverts. need real human interaction. People smart interact.  point is....it turns shit didnt NEED cancelled. needed mandates mask wearing....

the ""lack transmission"" coming protests, measures majority wearing facemasks proves argument then. 

if say ""hey! protest! doesnt lead ANYTHING!!"" say ""hey! cant go outdoor festivals even wear mask!! big no!!"" that's completely biased shit means exactly can’t keep spending money everyone goes minds crackdown every single person violating whatever health policy there. die?  Europe North American governments also thought could escape pandemic raging like wildfire China. Russia claims Putin's daughter got version vaccine. true yes, non Chinese versions vaccine seen similar levels adoption. Massachusetts! personally left hermit state I've play golf friends. Many wearing masks, one cart he'd isolating too. Hoping moment weakness come back haunt me, I'd strict avoiding sort social interaction, got weak made mistake. Hopefully wearing mask staying exclusively outdoors helped make relatively low risk activity. within 6 feet 1 guy sustained period time. Anyone half brain think complete eradication needed, we've seen far thay new cases really low level effective reopening really possible. new cases low enough seems like nearly full reopening possible masks distancing, US needed wait lot longer going it. Yeah that’s what’s annoying stories making news. weddings every single weekend, every city around country. vast majority weddings clearly fine Yeah, called Nazi couple times telling people report bars open April shutdown, way around.

I call guy Nazi defending dipshit wore KKK hood grocery store. that’s proudly declared nazi post history, n k word slurs back up. think complete eradication needed, we've seen far thay new cases really low level effective reopening really possible. new cases low enough seems like nearly full reopening possible masks distancing, US needed wait lot longer going it. talking me? dont want hear ONE PERSON subreddit FAVOR large gatherings protests, outdoor gatherings like festivals, hikes, outdoor activities concerts...

because say ok protest large gatherings taking measures wearing masks, political views social matter, ok go large gatherings measures wearing masks....

then nothing filthy hypocrite driven political message lancet study flawed. MMMMMMkay.

The lancet also published Wakefields flawed study linking MMR jab autism. retracted 12 years later. 99.3% people survive. unified national strategy it’s letting every state what’s best them. Good news, want country test vaccine phase three!

Bad news, there’s shitload covid test against! Oh, cool. Thank you. Nice Yeah dude pretty sure guy idiot. buy 'im chemist' bullshit either. Honestly comments straight pull shit ass like dude replied much, like wtf... sigh.... anyone know anybody treated ivermectin? Completely anecdotal know 3 people took first got sick got better within 2 days, know showed promising results critical patients wonder won’t give people mild symptoms. Oh fun! sweetheart's hometown nothing one family went vacation came back ran town. waiting this. go sideways. Great. rest U.S. finally understand like live time without global pandemic fuel it.

Maybe we'll take positive steps toward addressing mental health country, I'm doubtful.

Honestly, anyone surprised ""revelation""? put people isolation, increase stressors give little options stress-relieving activities help expect happen? No, jump extreme disagree common sense. got Australia 🇦🇺 Oh yeah, wearing mask helps, even shitty one degree. protests absolutely caused less spread activities due awareness many protesters real danger Covid19, protesters contribute spread, simple masks cure defense. 

My first rebuttal matter NEED aware actions, whether trip corner store smokes gum, rightfully, moral high ground, protest systematic racism police reform, effect others regards pandemic.

I wish protests made headway two years ago prior Covid19. Hopefully afterwards, immunities exposure vaccines make things safe, protests stronger public safety validity. clue. They're conservatives think figure blown proportion.... cousin cancer gets dies they'll turn other. care could also spread others. pure selfishness. I’m assuming it’s determine cause death mitigate spread? survivors severe COVID infections, ""recovered"" truly mean fully recovered physically well. Love great reason try work things out, money isn’t. Weddings expensive, divorce - better get treadmill sooner later. Im looking forward black ops cold war, cyberpunk 2077, pentagon releasing info ufos, anime like attack titan, etc. Even though im sure pandemic hard people things take joy in. according to:

1 Corinthians 13:5-7

5 Love rude, selfish, get upset others. Love count wrongs done. 6 Love takes pleasure evil rejoices truth. 7 Love patiently accepts things. always trusts, always hopes, always endures. people protest thousands others close vicinity shit, people open parks, outdoor festivals concerts, mandate masks.....

that's argument making Got married city hall, money second honeymoon, much worthwhile. Idk expensive ceremonies popular. bullshit statistic anyways. way number accurate way. probably much higher 12%. seems pretty representative me, smoking aside. still see lot smokers though, even seems apt. mistaken. Wikipedia lists 3.

The term ""comorbid"" three definitions: 

1. indicate medical condition existing simultaneously independently another condition patient (this older ""correct"" definition)
2. indicate medical condition patient causes, caused by, otherwise related another condition patient (this newer, nonstandard definition less indicate two medical conditions existing simultaneously regardless causal friends England abroad several times last weeks. surprising cases go there’s massive movement countries. Also, government wants people about. one go protests. Children go school seen going trends this??? lol. yah right. politically correct speak dont want looked ""bad"" say caused it. large gatherings = large gatherings None things would make lungs heal slowly possibility recently quit smoking, unknown. That’s selfish. I’ve postponed wedding 2nd time COVID. yeah fucking sucks least none family friends sick deadly virus.... like fucking math idiots. said self righteous rescuing ""I rescued adopt shop""is used good deed rather I'm better you. Moreover proving now, refuse see controlling putting potential adopters rescuers attitude be.

A typical rescue response rescues perfect like problem. previous poster likes call excuses yet excuses rescues reject potential adoptive families time again. However okay rescues wrong...

Having big yard may allow easier wash access still nothing physically mentally stimulate it. people sort training exercises, beyond let dog chatting phone. 

Yet dogs fine long hours. people work pets? good chunk population works, unless one lucky work home. believe dog crates place believe long term crating. xpens good solution. 

Separation anxiety issue dogs that's human commitment comes dogwalker, family friend, etc. truly love pets adjust accordingly. 

Sigh.....this stated reputable breeders puppymill breeders. Reputable breeders questionnaires, involved breeds, long pups left grown adults seniors good breeders still keep contact. Unfortunately crappy breeders reputable ones. 

If militant style rescue operation works power you. Hopefully rescue help animals need ""I'm better you"" badge. Though given responses get feeling reek it. shame surprising given amount crazies animal rescues general. don’t even care vaccine more. come second half 2021 earliest even we’ll wait many months vaccine distributed everybody end lockdown. then, dreams, future, life ruined. don’t even care point. based believe counts DoD civilians family members stationed overseas. Yeah mean 18 people immediate family couple’s best friend hazmat suit time yet? orr.... I'm sorry worried you, intention all! 

I'm going think loud you. fact young; experiencing systemic symptoms weight loss, etc.; painful; acute gone likely residual lymph node makes inclined think infection. fact unilateral, however, makes worried infections would cause bilateral painful lymphadenopathy. would worried lymphoma, since non-hodgkin lymphomas, particular follicular lymphoma, known begin cervical lymph node usually present B symptoms common lymphomas. But, lymphoma common adults 65 older unlikely 28 year old.

I think okay I'm sorry worried you. please watchful symptoms like fever, night sweats, weight loss, something seems ordinary, perhaps consider going sliding scale clinic something like? (I also glanced post history, work Amazon perhaps consider applying government job instead? government job kind, health insurance benefits benefits usually amazing). general, course sleep well, eat well, exercise like say do! (And please ever drugs again). 

I'm wishing good health! know irl care you! Please take care yourself! didnt think first wave ended there. Poor education that?

What? great school. Yes, graduated there, I'm 23 year old automatically thinks school awesome. got paid go like feel justify great school shelled 400k. objectively good school incredible location. Yes, insane costs much never would paid it, saying poor education dishonest. Schools back us. Got married last week cancelling 125 person wedding. We're going use money part house payment. bro... thats average (give take hundred)  Fuck you, fucking shit brains motherfucker. say real life I'll fucking rip empty head fat neckbeard body. Good. Oh no, cases rising, we've weeks behind France we're heading second wave, we're seeing lower death rate people still getting hit apparently  
permanent health problems... I'm sure feel good this? mostly you. Verifying data's integrity accuracy comes first saves us time invalidated. experts students thread parse white papers really reason sub reddit. Otherwise sign journal notifications favorite subjects' publication sources watch news feeds like Google science Slashdot. tried explain coworker. go back work university take hour subway ride ways, I'd rather risk vaccine Covid. bite. You’re expert? ""It's fault get depressed penned like human veal.""

Got it. It’s bit bad? Glad able honest therapist it. Stay us vote pig fucker out! thats likely due mutations cold viruses. Oh, yeah wear mask home. expensive mass scale takes long time.  agree you, Zoom birthday parties sound like suck sense seventh-grader. Reply back 27 years. floors uneven, basement half dirt part crumbling (but holding) way keeping rodents out. stairs narrow. upstairs bathroom plumbing all. kitchen moved in, built one. choppy one rooms think used garage. place expensive hell heat (maybe $3k propane one cold winter, ago memory hazy) practically insulation. yard also shaped like wedge pie *two* neighbors back yard.

I would losing job relocating DC years, I'll admit, yards worse. Assuming good insurance. Even deductible, plans pay maximum amount things won’t. You’ll get along 50% population basically ending pandemic. denier upon time others viewed America whether justified, last six months really opened eyes. it’s New Jersey cases extremely low. likely catch something else Covid. “Everyone works informal economy there’s little social safety net.”

Sounds like described US. think need different strategy work school staff campus kids 50% MA. kids required get flu shot December administration hasnt even mentioned staff vaccinations us, yet. Posted many times already. good news. NYC dealt much pain people quickly easily got message virus serious. say Karen  Imagine Chili's. Yeah I've back school 3 days masks really big issue thought they'd  no. God forbid internet connect us people. Imagine great must felt hundreds years ago? Sorry, decades ago.*

Again, you’re looking privileged perspective now. actually technology communicate people. Imagine going years without seeing loved ones? Yeah, pick point history.

Friends family, it’s restriction unable physically see them. part people need realize there’s something bigger going getting see mom dad often they’re used too. It’s called life. Sometimes throws curve balls. 

Let’s let depress us everytime adjust new change. That’s productive. kids cant goto in-person school, parents cant goto work in-person. improved capacity test, trace, isolate! Permanent damage yet around long enough know anything permanent That's besides Vegas population like 2,000. Get real man. NYC we're talking about. Back like may backyard making video go beat post Instagram, damn neighbor waltzes yard, tries shake hand starts asking I'm doing. Like I'm social distancing bro killing vibe. It’s amazing effective leaders 25% population immunity. coats Excuse me? stated 

""masks slow spread. stop it.""

I agreed saying: ""Yes"" asked point was.

You stated putting everyone risk.

I attempted clarify confusing remark time stated wear mask accused dumb win internet argument.

I aware arguing certainly disrespectful toward chose be... ... fuck can't civil. Vitamin theory explains EU countries suffered lot Singapore 27 death even though 57k confirmed cases. well Asian countries suffered relatively nothing.

It also explain Brazil winter now.

But explain current situation India, Spain US.  That's ensure efficacy. would never able connect side effects someone experienced ten years later vaccine.... would've really struggled learn mask went different gas station normal one. Everyone masks around chins. Wont going back. Numbers going area. lot people dont care Oh well. Gonna happen. Good opened. Lol December 2 months away

Edit: I'm wrong forgot November lol suggesting 20% significant milestone herd immunity? Also - isn’t running health issues Covid. also highly recommend children’s shows you’re deep funk.

Seconding this! Nothing calms anxiety like lying bed watching old sitcom. go beach likely get probably die faster. Eating healthy, exercise, fresh air, sunshine, taking vitamins extra good probably make die faster get covid.  That’s great news, really wish would go back calling correct term — “test-positivity rate” — instead “infection rate”. NY officials newspapers calling infection rate now? scientifically accurate description testing metric.

Edit - also nothing OP, know use exact title post Tuscaloosa Mayor reopens bars today COVID-19 spikes University Alabama. posted like 100 times today. Still great news wait 2 weeks assure doubled number. =) course vitamin finding studies linked coronavirus supplements potent supplements.  didnt say wearing mask putting people risk... damn well know that. dont act dumb win internet ""argument"". lame strategy BMI charts BS. poor measurement take enough variables like body type, muscle vs fat, etc...

I show slightly overweight put height/weight in, one looks would think overweight, good health. look normal, little bulky.

So can't always trust BMI. may show obese broken metric, really overweight factor variables. many people masking depression distractions like bars, restaurants, activities finding without crutch must face reality depression

I disagree. Strongly.

A couple years ago, socially isolated. friends. social interaction anyone besides family. went grad school idk things flipped upside down. made million friends going time. genuinely happy. ""masking depression"" reality is, human beings MEANT live isolated lives. social animal. ""regular normal"" actual normal humans lived generations across many different cultures.

Nearly 6 months isolation, honestly say I'm miserable. ""masking depression distractions"" beforehand, friends, going out, social, laughing, joking, making memories = humans wired. 60 confirmed deaths among children 0-14 US. 792 cases MIS-C, 85% children 14, 673 MIS-C cases children 14 under. estimated IFR children 0-19 (closest number could get 0-14) 0.0012%, implying ~5,000,000 infections children 0-14 US. 14 100,000 chance MIS-C infection based better numbers confirmed case count. 

Who knows exactly it'll shape later seems easily realm real numbers given know GBS, fairly similar condition. (25-65 cases per 100,000 c. jejuni infection 60-220 per 100,000 CMV infection. Manhattan dead Manhattan standards. I've alot recently. People NYC get really defensive reason, hint perhaps NYC empty before. is. Also, loads stores restaurants still closed, hopefully reopen. actually PITA get lunch dinner working Manhattan, impossible, keep going places finding closed. sure you’re downvoted. school open. class stayed home precaution. That’s point system. education monopoly run government, would much less likely run bureaucrats politicians. workers medics said real number cases considerably higher, including hundreds staff employed NGO partners working nearly dozen UN agencies oversee country's humanitarian relief medics relief workers sceptical official figures, saying authorities covering true extent. authorities deny that, admit testing UN expressed concern spread coronavirus country health infrastructure shattered war medical supplies medics relief workers say many doctors medical workers died recent cemetery officials say tripling burials since July cemetery lies south capital, NGOs medics say cases concentrated. Wow. She’s really bright. Sounds like totally reproducing 🙄 1) people hear still seem confused masks rules - many comments complaining people wearing masks, situations ""need"" mask in, exactly problem?

2) many people already it, spread far

3) NYCer, loads people taking repeat tests required keep getting work, # tests always necessary, drive % positive down. Honestly, meaningless statistic, especially here, since many healthy people taking work. useful death hospitalizations #s. They're 2 deaths day 450 hospitalizations total, state 19M people. lmao obvious, 2 American individualism ""individualism"" much tendancy unneededly contrarian ""right"" cost, even face evidence contrary  Probably none students, guarantee many community living around get end hospital. UT middle medium sized city lowest population density. think governments world run Corporate overlords care profit without regard human life. politician mascot pretend work public interest. He’s also lot smarter. Don’t fall act. important point. wasted many resources could directed towards promising treatments figure work. Rate infection spouses 30%, see Table 3 Household Secondary Attack Rates mink farms still thing Travel restriction returning UK UK subs do. don't. cookouts. stupid take unnecessary risks.  virus serving reveal shambles Johnson is, sooner would otherwise happened. 

He failure every job he’s ever taken, either sacked job lying quitting, lies failures discovered quit. Covid 19 proven utterly incapable taking practical step resolve problem. 

All he’s managed successfully find multiple ways enrich friends, thing well (aside lying), reason he’s elevated far heights someone intelligence talent ever reached sane country. dastardly cunning linguistics! need wear mask outside won’t care.  fault rewarding sycophantic behavior among leaders- want someone willing put skin line reason best strategy. vanity elect either charlatans people pander us. Maybe look buying mask bracket? 6.2M cases leaves 325M Americans still susceptible. Even 75% cases gone unreported, We're still way near herd immunity Gottlieb predicting.

The thing slowing people actually follow guidelines jumping Covid cess pool. well played sir. Gotta feel bad extent. point recent history he'd #1 world stupidity, lack self awareness, general dumb fuckery he's settle second entire time. tricky. easy say ""coronavirus bad! Close schools now!!1!11"" remains quite possible indeed happens again, nuances easily dismissed.

Speaking parent two schoolkids (11 13 - wish I'd picked better names), state certain amount (well, 6 months precise) experience impact school closures mental well-being kids absolutely huge and, given seemingly low impact Covid19 school-age children, I'd confident saying risk serious damage children extended absence may indeed much greater caused virus. doesn't, course, take account secondary infections people - teachers, parents, relatives (I say nuanced!) - certainly case made kids go back school even risk catching Covid 19 statistically higher stayed home.

My kids return tomorrow one glad see it. I'm worried (of course) far worried, especially eldest, darkest days lockdown. no, ask, Zoom viable alternative classroom. even close.

Disclaimer: none means Boris cock (he is) government making royal fuckup (they are), school reopening *is* important and, IMHO, delayed unless entirely unavoidable. didn’t, assumed study going title. curious kind study would blinded! :D fault there’s enough infections perform phase 3 trials. take vaccine. What's point? Employers never employee interests first place. little brother thought would fun go party first weekend student caught virus...hope vulnerable members communities live around students don’t see much virus logic would argue otherwise 😰 Living England terrifying rn. fucking goblin ruining lives. nearly died, really hopeful would start take seriously things gotten worse. Europe got control before, can't again? can’t right, gonna fight climate change? I'm single, live alone, turn 30 months. know there's lot people worse, still pretty shitty knowing 20s. lot cases, lot countries, politicians advised experts, listen them, change suggestion suit political needs much implementation becomes useless. lol still mask. madman! seems like 1/2 comments hidden. can't follow thread many comments moderated away. Eventually point coming can't follow thread. maybe lighten moderation? I’m impressed rapidly India expanding testing. test positivity rate also surprisingly low — 7% lately. many unnecessary deaths.  hope get lethal injection end shit Tell it, Hancock blaming 'young people' yet he's encouraging us eat time cram schools distancing. He's asking point. someone young person jobless pretty daunting. Seeing job applications online thousands people applying. Got savings meant potential university tuition I've education long get back swing writing 15 page history essays want piss away little capital worthless degree especially educational disruption going on.

Seems like there's going lot losers always select winners. 

Got tips? lol trying parse wallstreetbets makes want feed hands industrial shredder. mandatory wear one circulate tables find table go bar. Supposedly. take eat drink supposed take whenever feel like it. That's said that.

Also tables supposed safe distance one another they're places. people gather indoors more, makes virus transmissible. Temperature direct effect (though humidity might) impact human behaviour patterns direct impact. every comment make mental illness clearly apparent get removed? also part discussion yet people clearly ill spreading misinformation allowed plant seeds anxiety people. 

This also part discussion pandemic people unable cope come plant doomsday theories baseless claims that's totally fine let people read? Grab popcorn folks what’s coming. Take Finland another example. Two long borders, one terrifying virus propagation experiment called Sweden, Russia.
It helps largest metropolitan area 1.2 million people. But, one could forgiven think women-led, compassionate, center-left governments better this... professors too? get better grades? Oh, want know said! sick want consequences incompetent world leaders fixing make fortune disaster capitalism. Lol. least here, U.S., Trump done appallingly bad job handling COVID19. big part cannot negotiate with, bribe, intimidate virus. take tactics equation, come see embarrassingly impractical, out-of-touch, stupid, malicious, useless many politicians are. Ahhhh good ole deflection. Typical someone mental health issues. came comment sought out, millions posts, comments subreddits; I’m pretty sure that’s stalking behavior. That’s I’m even engaging conversation bc would love stop harassing get life. main point stop trying get someone kill that’s sort language using actions implying. I’m not, someone else bc isn’t strong secure myself. Grow up. Leave alone now, thanks great day 🙃  Agreed. Must nice live island.

E: thought snarky comment posted r/coronavirusuk.

No matter, frustrated brit here. relative lack obesity, want constant pinned post notifications people spoken said working remotely much harder inconvenient working office. easier lose focus, harder stay organized home. also can't develop good rapport clients via Zoom, compared meeting client face-to-face. know scene ""Jaws"" idiots tiny boat packing tons explosives hunt shark Hooper turning around, walking away going ""hahaha, gonna die""? Yeah. Coughy Top. too. want go back normal life again. I’m living life normal longer give bakers fuck seem obsessed. Paragraphs paragraphs response couple sentences. god take care them, it’s will. 10 what? think bigger issue Germany able achieve zero (this appears unlikely without vaccination) managing spread without compromising freedom movement especially crisis managed national rather whole EU level. Diseases tendency mutate away lethality. lethal disease good highly infectious, generally. quicker host killed symptoms shown less opportunity non-isolated contagion. You’re right, Syracuse located yeehaw part NY. point out. trialed/studied US? news summer. friends joked awhile. Every 2 months something told us could kill us. No, that’s guess. Imagine pillock condition 12th? symptoms? I'm really curious tested. assume sick prior, took test hospitalized later succumbed.
I know privacy laws place, would probably help others know people going through/have gone through, others aware perhaps take proactive measures. explained podcast one line argue dragging information 45 minutes makes good podcast? genuinely understand There's convincing fools. Sociopaths one all..... Woahhhh didn’t realize inability read anything past two sentences. guess intelligence forgot dumb level. content lines shows blah human are. I’m glad I’m you. doesn’t seem like healthy place be. Again, sought out. came reply post spewing vitriol. think that’s needs shown. 

What’s obvious scum like come Reddit social forum seek prey innocent, good human beings try tell value kill bc let’s real that’s basically implying saying “family hates me” “go dark bedroom alone.” I’m lucky I’m healthy minded, sound, grounded, intelligent, secure, confident individual won’t take single thing say account life put phone down. 

I’m saying you, I’m fully aware I’m rarity online. tons individuals aren’t would kill cruel bullies like you. I’m imploring stop trying so, seek help grow human I’m seeing sad individual gets jacked trying get someone something harmful themselves. Grow up, spread love, acceptance kindness stop bullying people online. Honestly, insurances cover network therapy low cost even several apps therapy days understand much personal anger trauma try attack people social forum zero clue are. 

This convo killed several brain cells. Again, pray fragile mental state hope one kills result blatant hatred targeted bullying. guy, matter. get told figure without time budget everyone yells like us everything set runs like shit best have. Admins twist failure part shift blame trying prove??!! mean honestly would want go right now. entertainment would normally go closed lot social unrest. matters more: instinct 'science'? get flu shot every year. doctor recommended pneumonia shot even though young (because two bouts pneumonia mean next one likely hospital), said hell yeah. got titers done realized mom might lied vaccines got caught everything recommended asked ones lacking recommend. probably pro vaccine person met. (I grew walking cemeteries name babies never made it, listed cause, often disease vanquished, often vaccines.  lived town settled relatively early remained small, history accessible cared).

I get Corona virus vaccine EU say good. Another *Handmaid's Tale* prequel box checked off. Look, stop thinking solutions ""fair"" start thinking ones work.

Sometimes can't choose fix problem fix problem way feels right. result important method, take option saves lives, even ""feels"" wrong. OH NO! INDOOR DINING! ahhh yes, art milking one tiny piece information create much room ads possible. He's got morals. current job always work home. signed on, stipulated days/hours would available, contacts sign-off (4pm) would charged time half. 

Nothing changed pandemic. must admit never chosen charge “after hours” rate, happens ***very*** seldom always brief.

I mention time time, passing, encounter someone haven’t worked (we’re global) someone new. Really, hasn’t problem, need establish boundaries, keep them.

I keep light: say something like I’ve used quotient brain cells day get back first thing morning. Please say that. get erect. co dragged feet years allowing work home.. announced would allow 2 days/wk quickly back peddled one. Now, everybody full time home productivity way way up. said looking allowing things return normal. 

I'm holding breath, think like micromanage person. Now, really shows little middle/senior management contributes. No, Boris Johnson puppet master, Dominic Cummings. I’m sure turn fine.. There's 100% correlation, early evidence Vitamin might causative factor Covid outcomes. recent data, promising certainly noting need larger trial, small number participants great difference outcomes. There's much larger vit study going right give us better answers. said, probably bad idea get sun/ take vitamin supplements somehow. can't hurt, expect there's something causative here. There's still 2 3 unaffected counties Texas. schools COVD dashboards counting tests given school. get sick test positive elsewhere, don’t count it. think they'd tell noble lies greater good. Nothing wrong that. I'm concerned survival specifically are.  life hard area already many sick elderly obese people population quite susceptible COVID19 He's lazy sociopath. good ideas here! like old ballot boxes repurposed student desk barriers.

Fuck!!! right catastrophic situation That's even little bit anarchy works I’ll look links work, don’t think argument making strong argument Politicians around world facing worst nightmare: actually something besides read speeches didn’t write.

Capitalism good parts. agree New Zealand done great job - certainly huge advantages island nation remote corner world ( relatively small population)  Europe, US  many deaths lockdown measures caused?   states strictest lockdowns (ex New York, New Jersey, California) highest death rates.  measures even work? might want help Sweden out, would real bro move. school child supervision, actual education - suck educating part. unfortunately can't supervise kids properly Zoom. Low population density, low traveller/tourist traffic, low testing availability.

Many places Africa yet receive traveller infected countries, plausible many areas never even contact virus begin with. RemindMe! 3 months go read passage talking see there’s kind good reason think says saying says? Bet politicians can’t work washing machine either  Spend 80 years iron lung.

6 months virus going wheelchair? Damn, rule thumb say takes 6 days recover 1 day hospitalized intense management (PT, etc). require oxygen life severely diminished quality life.

It’s really fucking hard couples don’t live together end social distance other. she’s back college classes won’t see school hopefully gets shut down. sucks much ass Yeah pretty short lived past next couple months. 1. sure say almost numbers keep climbing alarming pace.

2. Despite pro-vaccine much would love able run around freely society; leery vaccine created ready go less year. screams danger virus virus screams loudly.

Ergo.... end sight.

But, hope right wrong. Within first year believe. article describes timeline detail. Obviously longer time passes less likely side effect develop, *but* it’s also less likely discovered side effect vaccine. number seems low. cannot escape covid matter go. moment leave home told wear mask social distance.

It's scary. We're worried. We're hopeful, nervous. Restaurants already raised prices able hire staff back. employers taken pay cuts bring staff back. We're making 1/2 last summer, come winter, reduced GREATLY. Tip server. Wear mask. Support local. Worrying. Another reason take Sars 2 seriously dismiss another flu Yea, feel that, except COVID feeling pretty good single focusing myself, time around May feelings started change I'm thinking seriously dating apps trying seek opportunities. tough right though.

Drove Manhattan today. people wearing masks (still enough). you’re saying point try (the economy) doomed centuries? go ahead spend WFH set-ups

people risk die can't effectively perform person jobs prioritised... It’s called herd immunity. Gotta go enjoy outdoors  Absolutely could symptom depression anxiety. anxiety gets intense, mind switch ""fight flight"" mode release shots adrenaline aid response perceived threat. brain ask ""do fight it, running? Either way, here's extra fuel help us survive this."" But, then, nothing happens, physically responding perceived threat, adrenaline flooded body way out, hands shake, breath gets short, sweat profusely, heart flutters. “Yay. College kids returning. business won’t ruined. make it...

What, close two weeks?... yes, bunch college kids almost every night... No, don’t recall seeing much distance masks. there’s outbreak Campus, handful known visit here...

Uh oh. campus closed, bunch students going back home, means won’t see business long again... 

Our business may still survive keeps up.” fucking shit extraterrestrials coming since around. Species (plural) advanced us probably placed us planets. indications already present off-planet never ""wiped out"". Evidence: recent statements Pentagon &amp; DOD officials combined extensive history UAP country fucked. Take two.

All fucking man-made invention called money. know downvoted right. Speaking current admin, hell this? happened using DPA? 

By N95s anyone wants them. absolutely unacceptable we're still crisis mode *over eight months* first case landed shores. Doesnt place logistics burden themselves, find buyers / ship it?

because Australia good manufacturing capacity service areas like NZ, PNG, islands (Fiji, Tonga etc.). I'm certain suspect ability manufacture millions doses advanced.

Also assumption 2 doses, Aus would require 30-50m doses Read thread lol

I've completely consistent. federal government country lost backbone decades ago. entire society become horror story happens shift left much. Pharmacist here. Chest pain happen lot reasons one simple reason heartburn/reflex even gas. receptors around heart sensitive pain, reflux air sneak way cause serious discomfort. working ER load people come chest pain related issues.

TUMS easy short term solution, pepcid (famotidine) bit potent last half day so. Behavioral changes lying meal, avoiding large meals, eating slower help without using medication well.  


Obviously check doctor, never hurts ask. one things that's easily overlooked cause unnecessary stress. would shocked actually already something like 10% (already officially \~2% - barely testing start everything), mortality rate probably around 0.6%, probably underestimating deaths somewhere closer 250,000. lets say 0.6% mortality rate, would put us around 42 million infected. Continuing math would put us \~ 12.5% us population infected. Still lot people left infected, worry time vaccine arrives enough americans taken it.....we already close 50% people infected, closing 1 million deaths (actual reported). Ugh, needed take thing seriously months vaccines developed save close 1 million lives (+/- 500K) Wearing mask protect others, yourself. I'd anonymously report no-mask policy has, stuff super illegal am. must exhausted moving goalposts like that. People around never really committed anything complained little did. people wear masks socially distancing. family parents sister's family are. knew one friend also. Many people know went back work, never left. Practically nothing changed they're complaining. They're going restaurants seeing friends families complaining locked up. Meanwhile, I've actually cooped since March I'm immune compromised. sucks. simply direct quote article. remove post entire article...which direct quote from, editorializing whatsoever🤷‍♀️ serious pneumonia, actually quite normal. I'm position I'm fine. thing them. can't really anything else. words Beatnik Flanders; tried nothing we're ideas! Sadly think Midwest next region get hit hard fall/early winter. im tired ruining every relationship life infant im trying keep safe. Brazils southern hemisphere though, mean wait April!? lol  it’s cake day. I’m depressed. get karma?  baffling me, too. 
I'm also vaccine trial study since I'm showing antibodies, must received placebo. Kind disappointing, hoping level immunity. Yeah pandemic actually started Trump labs. Americans attention span gnat. can't tweeted away resolved next day's news cycle whine it, ignore it, tune anything out. Media capitalizes it. Never solve problem ignore move next. wonder anxiety high Americans always describe drowning. Every part American culture firehose sensory overload pushing next thing. never chance think breathe much less fix anything goes wrong.   explains people know saying they're suffering depression now. Even people never experienced past. ELI5/TLDR:

This shit sucks Lol beginning end. There's always empires almost identical throughout history. like playbook repeat new twist time. focus enjoying life dedicating time meaningful type charity always helps, forget negatives politics current events Ha! Ok. I'm done, win. 

I work morning, hospital (where people die). 

I get think America exceptional. struggle myself. still hold silly hope come together craziness.

Enjoy wrong side history, maybe they'll put text book Alabama, right next picture Jesus riding dinosaur. care economy, care stock market.

My thoughts watching international news. Horrible. India vast country cannot generalized. experience, un-built plot land poor family lived (possibly illegally/paying rent owner) next house. person family god heart attack others reluctant take hospital afford it. person unfortunately passed away.

Since slums poor too, think there's chance person taken hospital. Someone juts fever even report doctor. (Even family afford doctors never went one fever).

Ofcouse since pandemic, identified, might taken isolation center free cost, need identified unlikely hare serious case. Argentina morons anti-quarentine rallys. dang ur bitter af. there's much good world choose blame american society issues. f Almost 200,000 dead Americans, see problem.

Should concerned potential common seasonal coronavirus trigger dangerous COVID-19 immune response?

With cross reactivity COVID-19 seasonal coronavirus immune responses established, COVID-19 potential create hyperimmune response, could hyperimmune response common cold body recognizes common cold COVID-19? enough information yet exclude possibility?

i.e potential common cold pass immunization start triggering cytokine storms COVID-19 immune response triggered? Yes Sweden horrible long term side effects right now. It’s incredible even still manage function country. 

History kind like panicked state hysteria hopelessly tried stop function life itself. seems think can't control behavior (which absolutely can, even big ask) even try.

Because can’t.

I think smart way it. could possibly work too, since December still far enough future could make arrangement.  It’Ll dISapEaR EleCTioN!  school 30 teachers. Let’s pretend second there’s space 900 students school outside socially distanced (which isn’t). 30 teachers speakers trying teach next other? exactly power chords connecting? it’s 90-100 degrees week. We’re supposed sit hot pavement day? Even weather nice winter comes, sun day isn’t exactly good learning environment. rainy days? then? Please name place weather good enough year around even consider this. supposed sit ground? Drag desks chairs outside every day? books school supplies? Tons wasted time, nonstop distractions. Also, we’re supposed keep classroom doors locked times school shootings. Putting every kid every school grounds every day complete opposite that. district already two days bomb threats year (people stirring shit up). None would better online learning terms actual education. force that, admit want person babysitting cost quality education. 

I get exactly $150 YEAR supplies need 30 kids. $5 per kid YEAR. suddenly it’s “buy expensive microphones speakers, tents, etc.” 🤣🤣 I’m one “COVID brides” supposed get married May 200 people, make decision March 25 going postpone go ahead.

We postponed August. time, everyone thought would done August.

In mid-June, in-invited basically everyone ended 35 people wedding 100% outdoors also masks.

It beautiful day life wouldn’t way. 

My venue, totally gorgeous, total nightmare work with, would lost $4,000 didn’t wedding August. 

I understand pressure couples feel, seems like there’s always going way still get married, lose minimal amount money, safe it, too. people either delusional, psychopaths empathy care concern others. single covid, relationship relationship broke covid ended.

Careful though, apparently makes us Coronabros? equals 33,667 infections state, becomes 199,876 infections US, becomes 558,300 cases worldwide. math says roughly 5500 deaths. Hawaii I’m reuse n95 5x get new one. That’s way see rules varying state state successful resulting hotspots pinballing around country You’re making claim SARS-2 jumped humans 2012...? happen Switzerland. hiked biked whole lockdown. Meanwhile km allow 1000m away home. Finally people level It.... jumped humans 2012. Though you’re kinda right whole world is.... mostly better. clinically controlled setting... Maybe like Sweden, barely shut anything endured much higher deaths, least close economy... collapsed anyway people want go infect other, regardless policy. Source? save one life, worth thousand suicides /s Reddit neckbeard comment I’ve seen long time. Lmao Ditto That's hell metaphor. chance reaching worshippers, think? think I'll stay right here, mad? Iirc, also gave inheritance 21. 

A little funny footnote, youngest kid, told getting inheritance 21, thought around $100k (or something like … long time since heard interview). … significantly larger. Number cases useless information. single one went hospital story... suggested fines wearing masks right started happening got bunch sarcasm. 16,112,566 americans saw combat WW2. 405,399 killed. 2.5% mortality.

US population 320.2 million, 189,000 deaths. 0.05% mortality. 

This WW2 argument absolute trash. though. Someone brings back spreads. worked NZ isolated developed country world. countries connected one another unless entire globe coordinate start again. virus would probably kind asspull pop nowhere anyway. mean, NZ STILL going intermittent lockdown.

Even though I'm socialist I'm liberal reddit standards opinion ""life dangerous besides taking safety precautions whole lot do"" situation. Personally got March anything special. Ahh old friend live yet. pinpoint wedding?  Well one way rough people wearing mask nose generally taking much precaution. fear spread virus. hopeful

Read: “unbelievably naive childish” NY Times reported ago feds plan cover cost vaccine distribution. leaves cost administering vaccine insurers, providers, patients.

My prediction total cost less $10 per injection anybody sort insurance (regardless deductible) possible get free.  vast majority people truly can't afford $10 likely able get vaccine via programs funded state health departments.

Just prediction things looking like vast majority people money part problem.

Now... need thing annually, got idea come 2022. true, count number people ever want see one hand this. bride groom prosecuted

I hoping would expand part Y’all really brainwashed lmfao evidence emerged actual source animal market.

Because totalitarian CCP government capabilities reasons prevent evidence gathering.

It's best interests keep truth buried use weasel words like ""no evidence found"" change fact, recent publications seem cast serious doubt whole hypothesis.

The weirdest part looks cousin thinks “whoa”. know two people step cousins got married. Everyone justifies blood related knew cousins since like two. Shouldn’t looking loopholes. fuck Nevada's shtty Covid response New York?  

This competition.

My wife fairly cautious, noticing people lenient guidelines due mental/social/emotional needs (e.g. “I need hug someone”).

Has anyone else noticed this? people wagering chances getting Covid regain social emotional connection? 2% death rate unrealistic. Even previous post assumed 0.5% rate, still think high assume 100% population infected. vast majority mild asymptomatic cases undocumented. Family pressure extremely intense. told go wedding COVID family. Wedding didn’t happen planned end due law changing limit number people could attend. Maybe have. island helps lot, shutting hard shutting fast coorect course action likely saved lot financial hardship long run. suicidal depression got really bad February, fortunately got finally figured say lonely, heard lockdowns going happen, told “well guess I’m going able get proper help peers they’re going think became lonely lockdowns” 
Fortunately good news came late July told diagnosed high functioning autism, actually answers questions I’ve last 6 years. people probably terrified bill wasn’t passed protect case employees died virus potentially got forced come work. faced ""How come X allowed happen Y"" Covid question, implication allowed rather likely correct answer neither be. Cycling helping lot. Let’s get adventure getting exercise Yeah, get impression either, might worth trying. poster might ally roommate's fiance (sounds like live together) already reservations wedding. Maybe help understand need compromise. Ideally someone could go stay hotel Airbnb week, give virus time incubate, get tested, could live life like normal. know everyone $700 sitting around that, really pay it, poster, flip side poster high risk comfortable, might worth it. course poster certain actually get tested, otherwise waste money. 

Daily temperature checks still probably easiest compromise. Pre-symptomatic people tend exhibit fever symptoms fairly early ability spread infection, good tool. Asymptomatic people definition register fever, may still show elevated temperature, good baseline still see that. Thankfully asymptomatic people lower viral load far less likely spread virus, though definitely can. I'm getting take good precautions additional hygiene wearing mask couple weeks, along temperature checks, pretty safe (no guarantees!). roommate get COVID-19, hopefully someone leave highest state contagiousness, asymptomatic poster taken enough precautions minimize risk getting exposed.

Oh, can't get roommate cooperate, see fiance will. roommate sick, fiance well (especially attends wedding too). may willing temp checks get tested week two later. Thank do. much asked front line health care workers, beyond seems fair. Worst thing happens develop low grade fever, worst thing observed phase 1/2 trial. It’ll perfectly treatable Tylenol whatever similar medication might have, it’s low low chance happens begin with. 

You’ll likely experience adverse event, keep mind adverse effect mean degree redness arm. can’t remember last vaccine got didn’t produce Yea. Wow. Hey therapist, comment right here. That's real church. thought wait marriage? rapid test still self isolate take another test two weeks false negative always come kits same. flu pneumonia long term complications people.

Talk anyone who's pneumonia, takes months even year fully recover.

The flu cause heart lung issues.

We treat flu like COVID-19. People symptoms get flu tests. Willing bet would test positive like people test positive COVID symptoms. also test everyone dies flu like COVID.

Obviously COVID deadly flu scary people even media want everyone believe. sure wish best. Sounds like you’re headed right way. 

I chuckle end comment. Kinda like “oh, listened song way radio.” damages testes: New New York, afraid don’t buy one yourself?

The hospital every responsibility supply PPE, considering either won’t, unable to, don’t put protection hands purchase one?

Sure you’ll get price gouged want legitimate NIOSH N95, consider, even price gouged N95 costs less lunch. Seems like worthwhile investment you’re working patients.

Alternatively walk out.

My sister dr didn’t brains think outside box hospital/office/clinic decided wouldn’t supply N95s. blasted coming contact parents wasn’t wearing mask work. told N95 minimum requirement she’s coming extended close contact multiple strangers per day entering house people elderly risk comorbidities. couldn’t understand people getting N95s hospital wouldn’t even provide one unless procedure “aerosolizing event”. 

Buy one like rest us, online. Make sure you’re getting authentic NIOSH approved one. said commercial N95s, P95s P100s coming back market again. get one Home Depot even. It’s medical mask, you’re probably going put surgical mask cover exhale valve, it’ll job you’re desperate PPE. 

In world see normal everyday (non-essential) people wearing N95s shop supermarket...why won’t doctors encountering patients she’ll little dough buy N95 none provided.

Please note, opinion doctor shouldn’t shell meager sum his/her PPE, agree you. Though isn’t point. around 15-20% country, seems higher US: seems... dubious. But, lawyer. I’m sorry you’re dealing morally bankrupt people. It’d good could least return money instead charging full price. ??? Explain relaxing lockdown restrictions, scheme encourage people go eat month and, importantly, lot fellow countrymen fucking ***MORONS***. 

The amount fucking idiots can't follow simple rules like wearing masks inside one way systems aggravatingly people like girlfriends two asthmatic friends trying coax bar crawl extremely ill symptons. never thought humans would become damn weak. wonder world getting fucked sides. time? 



Time flat circle It’s 7 months... know say point I'm proud people put still push on. describe feel perfectly. feel isolated reached friends barely wanna talk. went catholic schools pre-k graduating high school. started high school, skipped first year Spanish math classes even sophomore year level covered 8th grade, jr year level going high school subjects. senior year high school one high school class, remainder classes college courses taught local college professors received high school college credit essentially college freshman year gen eds done. kinda annoyingly religious between, attend school masses top religion classes, think school masses like month liked sit class little bit lol  Yeah, UK response absolute mess. earth form bubble 4 care workers, client, parents visit, families home? consider quitting job finding work locally (I live abroad quite common line work due long shift patterns.) That, quarantine either side (potentially), risks flying themselves, plus extra bureaucracy brexit makes commuting UK less worth me. But, great time looking job. really malicious joke though? I'm seeing guy losing livelihood 1 sentence. 

I wonder start seeing government approved communication channels. People arent allowed talk unless government brand, heavily censored social media site ""Orwellbook"" make name Jesus amen 🙏🏼 dynamics schedules greatly attribute lack infection people took warnings seriously infected family members isolate within house.

The ""1 5"" stat people *didnt* isolate. Isolation drops number significantly.


Household transmission different bar. Think - 

If 5 people household, spending significant time together, X gives (20% chance) .. 2 people five it, spending significant time together. infection chance higher 3. one gets it, 3 people 5. long infectious phases overlapping, ""multiplies"".

This different transmission dynamics bar, happens 1 night. X gives Y, infectious yet. still one person infectious bar.

And considering infection chance 20% people *living together*, chance infection via casual contact bar must significantly lower, although cannot easily measured.

So say suspect data - confirmed - like masking PCR testing help reduce transmission - something similar may arise air travel - hard implement in-air protection since ivermectin boarding time may lead reduced transmission within 1-2 hours.

For strategy would require air travelers take 1-2 days air travel.

However host countries expecting incoming travelers - could require dose boarding time. way patient would reduced risk person spend next weeks host country. Demographically could make difference ie overall statistically, although individually would make traveller 100pct safe others. episode people actually die Yo wtf, Kerala become country? explain higher death rates African Americans Latinos native Americans, coz darker skin makes less vitamin D. Ah, stops spreading it, stop catching it? Best luck wishes India across border Pakistan. Hope guys pull thru this. ever since ill february, use asthma spray way often usually. barely days need it. suspect virus never tested knows. really sucks can't walk stairs without getting dizzy. i'm even overweight. good news long may immunity... bad news think herd immunity going work without vaccine. Yeah, found post yesterday saw someone tweeting ""equipment bought 2017"" response positive cases count.  Great idea....that's trump probably :( worst bout depression drinking heavily I’m isolated aren’t all? I’m suicidal it’s literal years. it’s even winter yet, free again? I’m even social person, I’m turning empty think virus could kill indirectly. lot cases young adults time. Combined (proven) new treatments, possible repeat April/May. apparently isn't, though.

All think ""just flu "" crowd never actually flu, one wants shit twice calling bullshit that.

Really, Nazi.

Along lines ""The weak people society insignificant you.""

I would go back pull examples far back history. ""crisis months"" around April/May/June.  LMAO. People kept interment camps years, versus months weeks students re-education camps. There's zero comparability. Mmm. can't seem find source remember reading this. 
Disregard. found study indicating though. blame people didnt take covid seriously

still dont That’s stupid reasoning. person diabetes comorbidity, would died without virus.

It’s also case US doesn’t count way Sweden, way leads lower numbers. Sweden counts anyone dies within 30 days getting virus, regardless cause death. get tested die car crash way home - that’s covid death Sweden. 

And yet, despite incredibly broad definition, reviews death certificates Sweden shown ~10% deaths Covid deaths caused covid (e.g. car crash example). Add Texas PPE shitshow list. Joined sub January days, leading world finally realizing threat unfolding. say shutdowns began distinct feeling sadness loneliness. girl started talking ghosted quarantine (man great great lockdown dates) talked again, bam ghosts shit getting good. Discovered I’m wine lover that, spent rest quarantine wishing girl didn’t did, SAD time. good boys girls! LOL bad getting flu interest? couple times last years thought flu might nasty cold someone work told flu even able get bed? Could also purposes like traveling. Assuming believe works, one could make personal decision take dose senses exposed.

If strategy would make sense take early time exposure, slightly after. could consider repeating symptoms develop. I'm sorry imagination limited. idea obsession word left phrase shift left means delegate responsibility subordinate. nothing direction left. Quite contrarian scientist/doctors saying herd immunity kicking 15-30 percent. think hearing time goes on. masks slow spread. doesnt stop 


2.53 death per millio US. 0.21 France. 


New cases magnitude, France increasing. [They clearly need Health What’s worse winter coming tends fairly depressing season. Hello,yes correct,I double check numbers, thank correcting me. two things point really want part discussion, think arguing bad faith.
One, covid-19 truly airborne; spread aerosolized respiratory droplets easily stopped by, idk, mask. two, yes population asked stop ""acting like social creatures are"" before. Like, think words quarantine social distancing invented past 6 months? weren't. difference past efforts quarantine efficient lack global communication network like now. Quarantines localized, still effective communities. Hahahah PoWEr lOVe hell hold demonstration virus? dumb?

The answer obviously yes. Social bubble lol. everyone social bubble it’s ocean bubble.  point get numb numbers. could go back 75k/day new cases debates masks mortality. 

Some us masks, social distance, observe guidelines. Others shout everything hoax world working president.

I guess accountable best assess risk carry best can.

Good luck all. individualism, contrarianism. lol ""obscenely dangerous"", wow stay bunker pal else gonna get INSTAKILLED beer flu. one wants next 'Wuhan' terms leadership. ""

But thats problem argument, exactly would cases go unreported.

You honestly think rationale behind wanting next Wuhan Xi upset truthful? No, need hide places also clear virus new cases much argument.

It's statistics. I'm sorry never received class. take American, guarantee would've thought polling wrong media restrictions, yes media controlled. information flow nearly tight may think, live city recent outbreak (if call handful cases outbreak) news gossip flying official announcements. really believe China complete control internet really case.

Your content curated ridiculous degree denying exposed rest internet quite sad. Likewise, I'd rather trust dozens upon dozens independent organizations governments investigated internet censorship China. widespread pretty sure never convinced, want naive kind using preconceived ideas China without actually truly knowing place.

I'm using probability. I'm sorry covered schooling. extrapolate nations like South Korea New Zealand, use tools like Bayesian Analysis understand likelihood certain situations - even without full knowledge. 

Unfortunately, reliable mortality statistics China judge excess mortality. Quite literally overwhelming majority nations reporting deaths **and** cases. Nations like Indonesia, example based upon excess mortality, likely 3x reported deaths. Guess what, trust numbers. bone pick Indonesians. Peru, Ecuador, Chile, list goes on. care nations either. recognize under-reportings, whether willful not, nations. one nations argue like point out.

Note, I'm even stating China literally dying whole populace one foot grave. I'm stating zero domestic transmission extremely unlikely would seriously bet money third-party, omniscient arbiter give us answer, government, local national, willfully hiding numbers. Even small. taking 1.5 months, wonder quality. Anyone know high quality Vitamin brands look into? Thank you. Good them. time people realized actual risk worth living crappy life. that?

European, forced listen political discourse stay informed. level political discourse indeed abysmal, comparable populists dictatures, one side.

I'm sorry say insults, lies, incoherent divisive discourse comes Republicans, credible, uniting voice GOP since McCain passed away.

You cannot say sides same.

This r/politics reddit seems left leaning: educated audience stake election process, possible debate: GOP falling trap authoritarism &amp; populism, leads fascism, Democrats divided, sure, keep tolerable level sanity. feel worst, often, plant tree. Depending long takes get test results back, likely longer. 1-2 weeks infection get sick enough decide need test, 1-2 weeks results. yes, cases long-term damage every disease well. like flu example. thats hardly metric use decision making.

On one hand say come deaths heart disease experienced significant drops essentially locked areas?

And say also surge heart attack deaths 911 calls heart attacks NYC correlated perfectly spike COVID deaths.

Your article perspective hospital. say seeing fewer heart attack patients. explain - concerning possible explanation people stay home suffer rather risk coming hospital getting infected coronavirus. theory suggests Covid-19 instilled fear face-to-face medical care. result, many people urgent health problems may opting remain home rather call help.

Which confirmed articles like - 

[Online searches 'chest pain' rise, emergency visits heart attack drop amid [articles like supporting people United States dying COVID-19 pandemic, **but coronavirus**. One reason, experts say, people ailments may seeking conclusion emerging new research showing *deaths increasing causes heart disease, stroke diabetes* – emergency room visits conditions down.

And like -

Yeah. No. consider bonus. Large academic hospital denver.

Hmm depends, there’s lot take account looking “clinical scientific studies” science students whole subject assess studies weigh legitimacy importance relation studies aim goal. I’d say it’s important simply accept facts straight away scientific study claims something. Spain watching like yeah sure Again, Sweden sovereign country merely shared king Denmark. personal union king Swedes elected. Danish state government nothing Sweden. Polish-Lithuanian king Sigismund also inherited Swedish Crown, one says Sweden came Polish rule. countries ruled entirely separately different governments answering king.

Absolutely agree - and, what's striking case excluding two trials meta-analysis (on Mongolian schoolchildren toddlers Afghanistan) markedly improves I^2 (ie, pooled estimate heterogeneity) pulls RR highly significant heterogeneity, researchers explore causes heterogeneity. included studies, Camargo et al. [3] Manaseki et al. [4] found significant effect vitamin risk respiratory infections. However, former carried Mongolian schoolchildren latter 1-36 months old children Afghanistan. two trials removed meta-analysis sensitivity analysis, evidence heterogeneity decreases substantially (from P=0.001 P=0.04) evidence benefit vitamin vanishes RR=0.95 (95% CI 0.90 1.00; P = 0.07; based 4157 infections among 10202 participants remaining 22 trials).

Mass testing ongoing covid-19 infection largest date Sweden. first test round started last week, 8,000 test answers students teachers submitted.

\- extremely positive. 8,000 samples, found two active covid-19, unexpectedly small. majority age group 20–30 expected greater spread infection, says Anders Johansson, researcher infectious diseases University project manager mass testing.

During second sampling week, hope everyone took test last week again. time, people encouraged participate survey.

I read lot these; one may worst. (Kid diagnosed positive, quarantined, still went partying.) 

Another shocker: county “red” one state, due cases traced university. Now, in-person K-12 whole county can’t go forward numbers improve.

(If parent K-12 student wanted f2f school, I’d knuckleheads.)

Another thing stands suspension: allow student continue classes, remotely. 

Not one. They’re done. least semester. Coronavirus: Good choice! Firstly cannot look overall admissions figure UK welsh numbers comparable. site actually tells look information.

This sentence makes sense.  relatives India telling parents news basically stopped reporting covid completely. Apparently SSR China . true ? sat study wrong. justified saying study published lancet. pointed that, lancet also published flawed studies past mean much. It’s supply/demand. time effective vaccine comes already tested people study side effects. wouldn’t test elderly risk people. takes mass produce 7.8 billion vaccinations. Unless people complying contract tracers... don’t know already Clinical depression. Simple plebs... number patients could random.

One imagine WWII Black Plague Genghis Khan ravaging Asia among million crazy events human history. like always, strongest survive...

It's mental attitude displaying greatest trait humanity posseses; adaptation. day opportunity show world really deep down. person things going well easy, hard that's soul shines through. economy also opened slightly past months. Shops open distancing rules. Restaurants open delivery only. offices operate 20-30%. 
So really crazy dilemma, economy people. thing is, economy opened, government means support people, terms stimulus checks/ UBCs.
How look depends morals right wrong, also seems like there's solution rn. Vaccines best bet along trying best test trace shield new infections critical studies peer reviewed companies completely remote work employees happy. go make sure everyone valued included set expectations. Working home schooling home fine, neither give one feelings separation isolation. feelings easily happen person well, lots people feel work school too. makes think could likely even possible? really? get type haha  Plenty DPA money Kodak, company zero pharmaceutical experience plenty political connections. ACA made caps illegal afaik. vaccine get every year

That's known yet, covid far less mutagenic compared influenza. likely people need two doses nothing needing annual dose. 

For viruses annual vaccination either. Sputnik shock intensifies Same. husband didn’t attend cousin’s large indoor, maskless wedding July. addition, pool parties, cabin weekends, birthday parties, baby shower barbecue. top off, holiday weekend, side family flying 80+ year old grandmother town throwing big party. masks social distancing, it’s potluck. grandma spending days kids’ homes flies back.

Study says diff form Vit supplement people staying home counter balances increased transmission protests doesn’t mean increased transmission protests didn’t still occur. 

I haven’t claimed otherwise. said issue protests widely overblown cannot cause aggregate surge cases, that’s one. 

Two, looking data - protests directly caused increase stay home compliance - making overall net effect protests positive. 

It quite obvious, rather useless point protests caused cases. What’s exactly point made? know non-zero, quantifying actual affects form policy even opinions whether protests dangerous significant degree. evident not. attributing decrease increasing ignoring people right thing ACTUALLY ones decreasing it.

I honestly think misunderstood me. FYI haven’t joined protest don’t support going one. I've able enjoy hobbies Covid. nice. read Florida attacks northerners! Lmao Man stories horrendous. I'm wedding DJ pretty much whole spring/summer season (Australia) pause. couples said venues shut lockdown forced postpone.

I've also attended friend's wedding via zoom allowed gatherings 20 people.

I understand need attend weddings moment. means something, incorrect say nothing. reopen indoors. him, whole party Hi hi stranger reddit ICU week sepsis ended incredibly weak among things. can't imagine would like several weeks. Also 1889 Russian flu killed 1 million people    Good. schools forthright number cases. It’s outrageous public schools won’t, don’t to. taxpayers know, let alone students faculty. Australia? Probably. Make sure wear sunscreen though since Australia notorious skin cancer. many restaurants already open dine-in Canada.. spent hundreds words trying justify small gatherings risk large gatherings 

No. argued protests tiny fraction every day activity, making insignificant grand scheme things. is, protesting injustice isn’t going spread disease allowing multiple small gatherings(like “visiting parents” often) way worse. 

I’ve held opinion forms protest, including anti-mask clowning. COVID-RED must dangerous one Yes. much mean spiritedness. try remember civil social media. best wishes you, whether agree everything. Hey buddy, there's conspiracy human nature.  Interesting. time amplify intake Vitamin Deeznuts. 10 upvotes use word “chimera.” bus driver I've known years passive aggressively told got married last weekend ""ina church. outside like everyone else."" 

Then said covid disappear election. 

This entire bus ride triggered downward spiral. dumbest bot I've ever seen maybe, get blood levels see self. Okay time bail go full conspiracy theory. SSRI took time get adjusted to, weeks definetly helped well! im trying quit benzos covid cant now... also physical pains horrible :( Ouch Risk needing ICU reduced 97% highly statistically significant p&lt;0.001. 

Its always nice big sample size effect size large enough less important. effect size massive. Excess deaths include covid deaths lockdown deaths. long haul covid, lockdown deaths misery persist years. going talk thousands protestors streets without masks? Normies weak. It’s 4 months behind inside time, that’s ppl’s entire life, chill  New zealand, again! ;) Majority people care want lockdown end. government care. cat I'd probably kill point. No, that's normal dedication them.

That's expect normal empathetic society. elite return fleeing March Hamptons bring back rampant spread Covid them. There's ethical problem long volunteers informed might receive placebo. medical trials, placebo controls extremely important getting clean efficacy data.

For example, suppose vaccine 70% effective, placebo every participant knows getting vaccine. believe they're immune, go party nightclubs, increasing risk catching covid relative general population. analyze data, seems like vaccine 40% effective, health authorities reject it, whole world suffers. Ended four year relationship recently, things got heavy COVID lot it. Breakups always suck it’s also made realize lucky friends check me. try return favor also look myself. 

The weirdest worst thing is: ex engaged, pretty deeply love majority time together. since split she’s said hurtful stuff. Don’t know always felt way, she’s trying rile me, it’s stress related. Maybe 3.

Nothing risk free, I’d rather get vaccine risk getting virus, especially considering would year since testing started time general public got already underwent multiple phases. ”Hardly test” 

Testing nearly 1% population per week bad, especially 1.4% positive rate. may test much, certainly aren’t finding cases. considering Denmark cases/per capita think conclude Sweden least pretty close Denmark new infections. still havent offered evidence I’m lying.

nope, sorry, value brain cells brother lives Washington State going get married April.

I don’t cancel appointments, since don’t make first place. 

I’ve discovered many new hobbies interests. “Adult” coloring (e.g. mandalas), Anime (never thought I’d like cartoons wow!), propagating succulents trading online, online gaming, cooking, etc...

Not go anywhere see anyone incredibly cathartic. Sure. Right show long term study showing it’s safe. also HQ site largest factories.

Oh also...Honeywell based Minneapolis. people know making thermostats also make missile components and........  Respirator masks (Under North brand name).

So two world's largest PPE manufacturers located Minnesota MN hospitals still problems getting masks. stupid. Americans try walking biking sitting outside — instead driving everywhere sitting dark TGIFriday’s a/c blasting. COVID-ULTRA

COVID-LITE Press freedom double edge sword. much control get North Korea, much freedom get Trump president.

If democracy freedom truly works, businesses would employees vote bosses. someone would gone thru mock exercises regarding new virus hitting US. 

If results mock trials pointed weak. 

If playbook sort would prepared using information.

If playbook would used actually happened. Actually, tbh people wearing mask parks. Im downtown Brooklyn I've parks. people mask on. Theres soccer, volleyball, basketball games going mask. pier Dumbo different outdoor activities. forget mask barely anyone wears one. even opened Rollerblade rink. streets yes, people wearing masks see people also aren't. exactly NYC good? know we're getting this. hope thing next year. Careful people! people like love act like COVID magical virus first we've ever encountered. lose heads going complications attributes seen thousands times viruses.

It always framed way spread fear amongst unaware things unheard surprising l. find people spreading fear like repugnant.

I deeply wounded yiur xenophobic comments.  statement true, see article anything help stop spread covid. actually probably even helps person, never heard  Herd immunity. 

A couple studies suggest covids herd immunity threshold may pretty low. mean actually 50% vaccine improve things 50% I’m going tell wife power Show single report data point pointing leading vaccine candidate dangerous. anti-vaxxer. Psst hate person think meant 1918-1919 Spanish Flu... testing tiny university middle nowhere pretending says anything. Fast tracking doesn’t mean skipping testing, still phases ... means producing loss doesn’t it? Sure, totally changes science works. really bioavailability makes difference.

D3 storage form Vitamin D, meaning take 100,000 IU without negative effects whatsoever, D3 nothing directly affects body.

Unlike 25(OH)D3 even worse 1,25(OH)D3.

Because liver step controlled body produce demand.

The kidney step simply dose dependent. 25(OH) present, get 1,25(OH)D3.


And latter form actual active Vitamin D, point overdose, even small one cause drastic effects.

100,000IU active form cause serious symptoms hypervitaminosis D3.


These things hold true even IV application, know bioavailability makes difference.


Btw body mid summer sunbathing noon produce 100,000 IU day.

The amount D3 bodies produces varies within huge range, hence 'immunity' large doses D3. Otherwise everyone outside summer would serious symptoms quote bunch non-peer-reviewedabstracts, mostly math modeling. think know. know herd immunity hard imagine community adults spent past 5-6 months social distancing. That’s great report. already know many [half reported research findings would surprise find drugs aren’t effective either. [This study found, example, effective antidepressants least prescribed, drug-company profitability media spend driving use effectiveness. Trump politicized start. week 35 (August 24-30), 246.000 individuals got tested Denmark. 

Sweden tested 81.800 last week way worse Sweden. 

Can't high numbers new sick people hardly test *pats side head like trump USA* least points towards recovery path Exactly. harmless virus now, i’d much rather take chances catching it. mean I'm saying major spreading events. I'm saying masks slow spread, can. easily Google large numbers people protests wearing masks wearing improperly. lighted lighter hand still wet think. Critical thinking skills lacking  semester? Probably right choice.

The year? Ehhh would surprised spring person. vaccine released, universities would probably running even without general public access it. College students getting sick concern really. don’t even think that’s going thing. wide enough roll out, things likely go back normal can’t lag society people refuse take vaccine.
 
I could see threshold “x percentage population needs vaccinated concerts return.” 

Even vaccine makes Covid bad cold, things return normal. Society isn’t going wait anti-vaxxers grow brain cell. social media cancerous full lies. long bank Vit. D?

...just social media cancer. So, point still valid. actual f*** wrong world? Wow, great news. Thank sharing. I'm going keep eyes ears anyone claiming mutates quickly proofreading mechanism. Right wing expect? Also filtered air Doesn’t bother unlike I’m ideological hack President: ""Hey big pharma - put vaccine make billions trillions government 'contracts' don't, face unhinged wrath.

and hey FDA - yeah, you- make sure say vax good big pharma PR cover winds harming people""

Big pharma: ""woooo bonuses going fucking fat next quarter. *pops champagne*"" make money year life. power crowd funding ADs ordered ""Whooper"" instead ""Whopper"" Burger King order taker miss beat. think put lot there. Proper since actually managed get point Exactly, “not right away mean”. week? month? year? Keep mind approved vaccine won’t available general public, wait see category consider long enough? Unclear ... kid would fine. Children hidden attics years gone less normal lives. reason think slightest inconvenience huge hurdle mental health development. American mentality really astonishing. using word WRONG. Changing opinions based FACTS form hypocrisy champ. changing opinions based facts learning, that, may well head sand (as sure do). Targeted spokesmodel soon masks became political knew long haul, wasn’t going huge tell, way president governors acted trying get economy open also reinforced going shot show while. hope possible vaccine coming around end year (that far Fauci’s approval) become newest catch-all stupidity band-aid like flu shots years years.

It’s truly amazing much took granted flu shots medicine help diseases. don’t that, society takes hit hard, mainly states. times we’re living make worse national plan put place, mask use always ends political debates, people still struggle thing basically flu still deny exists go lives, etc. simple vaccine shot would gobble uncertainty, anxiety, stupidity we’d back Feb/March.

Hopefully SOMETHING put place finally recover never experience again. think depends area. I’m around NYC, talking apps. first person got number from, asked wanted Zoom date coffee date/walk park comfortable. It’s communication/comfort zone (I live studio don’t usually cross paths many people). Many foods Canada supplemented vitamin D. 1 cup (250ml) milk, contains 45% daily recommended amount. distinctly remember people comparing governer hitler. Anti-maskers is. take 50,000UI week, keeps normal range. get tested year check levels. They're usually 1000 UI. 25% students + staff. consider full-time students + staff, would 40%. 🤣 making comparison discredit truthful assertion? You’re total ass.

Somehow don’t think you’re hurt all. seem live type conflict. Hippocrates said let food thy medicine let medicine thy food. idea wild? diet given autistic kids miraculous results. Children go 17 spectrum 2. argue something works helped many people already? I'll take less inflamed brain everyday week. third largest university Sweden people country. know Americans proudly ignorant everything outside borders, limit commenting places grasp geography can’t really quantify risk, we? Like, grew environment effectively zero risk catching illness possibly deadly life-altering consequences. I’ve caught flu half dozen times, always felt fine week. Calculating health risks going party isn’t something us used doing.

The infection rate numbers suggest it’s pretty unlikely you’ll catch meet friends park without masks drink without hugging kissing, even someone group COVID. people obviously time Prospect Park local infection numbers haven’t budged months. So, like 5% risk catching environment? so, worth it?

This relevant risk isn’t going back 0 even vaccine. I’ve avoided maskless socializing summer, next year choice living like hermit forever accepting level risk. opening schools going maintain numbers? makes zero sense. we'll lucky we're 10 percent november Agreed. gotta keep best masking etc try live along side it. fucking stutter thedailybeast.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Virtually one would, herd immunity. 99% Covid's opportunities transmitted would fail; meaning effective reproduction number would virtually nothing it'd wither away weeks. 

If vaccine 75% effective, 2/3 take it, restrictions removed, would dangerous 1/12 population remove restrictions future, would removed restrictions right - least 1/3 anti-vaxxers ruining everyone else.

I'm one thinks ""one death many"" removing restrictions post-vaccine basically saying there's nothing else giving up. Instead, need whatever takes keep effective rate transmission 1 (which lot less need right now) Covid rare easily stamped tracing. took months officials states recommended masks. surprising they’re behind recommending vitamin too.

This take away women children abused horrible, state domestic violence much highlight issue mostly ignored.

Statistics:

166 Million Women US: 41.5 million abused

160 Million Men US: 17.7 million abused

(I statistics men relationships men women relationships women, someone numbers would great well. need end domestic violence.)

Alabama better neighbors literally setting bar low possible.  need take long period time. builds up. Ah, makes sense. Thanks!  Sweden can't miss lot cases since randomized trial 2500 found sick people. assume Sweden 1 sick per 2.5k persons would mean 4k sick persons. sick 15 days would 270 cases find per day, roughly Sweden finding.

Now test 2.5k positives still 1 sick per 2.5k still miss lot people, least know missing huge outbreak since way would cases among 2.5k randomly selected public health officials recommending high-risk individuals take Vitamin supplements regularly? evidence correlation Vitamin levels COVID severity overwhelming point. sister-in-law getting frequent sinus infections year round.

I’m sure scientists made massive strides pretty much know serious long term effects. right won’t know.

I’m sure weighing...will long term effects vaccine entail 1000 people dying day? Doubtful, case already looks better letting pandemic play out. long term effects vaccine worse long term damage getting covid19? don’t know I’m sure smarter people looking me. 

In end, since unfortunate place now, best course action end restrictions vaccine released let people choose take risk. People take vaccine continue sheltering pandemic. end probably what’s going happen don’t see US least forcing people take vaccine. thought 40 way low. 80 adviced, 100-120 good. Thanks!

International media reported well Swedish situation. actually lockdown, sortof. enforced law. big gatherings closed, almost shops take extra precautions etc. etc. China hacking covid 19 real, gg wp yep, coworker delayed summer next. cried lot time delayed back april, absolutely correct choice. don’t think they’re suggesting try specifically identify “superspreaders”, rather making argument younger people prioritized vaccination predominant “superspreaders”. obviously goes common argument vaccinate vulnerable first.

Eliminating virus seems question far I’ve heard “we need lower infection rates” okay...to keep without restrictions?

And actually lot short cuts safely take vaccines. spend money resources quickly enroll lots volunteers, manufacture vaccines loss hopes passes, run multiple trials once, deliberately target hot spots. contribute much faster trials expected without undercutting safety.  soylent cubes

I animal studies btw (I physiologist) legally required use smallest n possible achieve acceptable statistical power, given effect size &amp; variability seen pilot trials. example, animal study proposed larger-n followup, likely wouldn’t get approved. that’s animals; bar higher humans.

Also, generally, normal n experimental trial clinical issue, good n even, case-controlled intervention trial. physiology n’s low 8 per group effect sizes strong.

And could deficient something else too. According what? lot happening places eyes on, reporting on, nothing. People dying, bodies lay gutters streets even houses, even happened China, happening India. even getting fraction picture developing nations. society taking precautions in. Sweden? heard lockdown mask requirement, even oficial required people acting? think many anti-mask people angrier enforcement necessarily masks, idiots non less suspicion case. NYC* Shame fall winter around corner. WNY? spikes awhile now, wouldnt say incredibly low. schools reopened close shut 2 weeks. Give time, they've back class couple weeks Hot take, outside sun good you... Never let good crisis got waste. don't. I'm surprised Swedish government resisted temptation ""show leadership"", Many countries gone totalitarian big government approach, even supposedly things.

However think less wisdom government simply saw way shift responsibility.

Joe Rogan right along like tiniest half second sting. ? comment says 60,000 IU/day harmful, you’re fine 5000 lol 3 weeks /u/crapthatsgreat wrong people?!

Oh, hear? United States education systems intentionally dismantled, effective propaganda distributed now-ignorant populace, almost none critical thinking skills.  really great America, toilet nation. Well although test proliferation certain immune cells test neutralization SARS-cov2 vitro, obviously know sure protected enough control agents infected significant degree number infected vaccine. means, data bad, prevalence many side effects post vaccination bit concerning public perception vaccine, overall best ability tell whether individual immunity virus, appears promising.

Also I'm expert, I'm wrong facts someone feel free let know. plant help depression? wow! figure yourself?! yaaayy :D I'm american use masks explain lot people, engineers asymptomatic people thing still get people sick despite feeling fine. 

We learn school suppose Americans also learn suspect everyone simply preoccupied passing exam actually paying attention textbooks. Ive noticed sometimes knowledgeable get Bs. know. Even extensive testing show happening. needs study. It’s not, it’s really hard overdose vitamin give Boston credit... certainly arent perfect want make masks def norm area people horrified idea clubbing Highly absorbed mag doesnt cause osmotic diarrhea though. hope 300mg magnesium aspartate take daily isnt much. Misandrist When’s last time heard full 1/4 guests large wedding getting flu? Mississippi worse-affected state moment. Here's latest case death charts, running 7-day currently #1 terms running per capita Thaaaat's MAGA baybeeee people getting vitamin (besides sun &amp; milk Canada)? Supplements I've seen online 1000IU, lol I'm taking 10 pills/day... take vitamin vitamins blood test showed deficient doctor said taking OTC fine. current 5000 IU, way mentioned comment above. doctor said one fine. I’m worried it’s much. It’s shelf Trader Joe’s. comment exposure rates/facility headcounts day vs night shifts? Everyone knows this. nobody saying vaccine coming wide distribution 2020. Even CDC indicated such. weeks term started I'm sure parents thrilled life back asymptomatically give kills  businesses need kept afloat pandemic makes sense use taxpayers dollars keep afloat later date. Otherwise raft empty storefronts gathering dust addition mass unemployment.

They’re already empty restaurants bars shut down. Mass unemployment issue could covered via UI and/or UBI.

Ultimately IMO, issue whether society owes anything bar nightclub owners shutting greater good. countries (I assume Canada included), give lot leeway public safety. It’s highest priority imperative state. bar owners home owners losing houses new freeway overpass via eminent domain? temporary buggy whip factory owners should’ve carried 18 mo cash reserves? Clearly necessary even far airlines go. new entrepreneurs sprout soon vaccine availability allows (same airlines). anyone suggestions good Vitamin supplement? Building fat cells. Takes achieve - also, slow ramp results less side effects (diarrhea can’t absorb fats
Due stomach/small intestine issues). Reported misinformation. Last time bunch military personel infected closed boarder kind shit talk majority family anymore.  mom dad's mom shit mean tolerate idiocy. great life, mororns. legitimately laughed loud. Here's map hot ranked list states per capita deaths prior heck cartoon even represent? rocket taking submarine? Haha maybe wow always heard took much vitamin/supplement piss excess research need done.

But, governments also recommend taking Vitamin day early findings. It’s cheap easy solution that’s harmless taken correctly. it’s proven correct - millions lives saved. seems irresponsible to. repair repair. problem publication bias. That's big numbers important.

Also understand peer reviewed yet double blinded.

More studies needed. Yeah, have, thanks! live Sweden well occasionally coming back sub check things. Thanks work you’ve put hard you’ve tried dispel spread misinformation. think meant “with”. bubble feasible? Good thing I’ve vitamin daily 2 years due autoimmune disease. nice know may actually giving protective layer. alpha quarantines time realize problem start work professionals? 6 months 17th. Nice see randomized, placebo-controlled blinded clinical trial published scientific, peer-reviewed journal science press release. Easy predict though trigger run vitamin Why? What’s point opening indoor bars? economic impact minimal. Here's latest case/death charts Las Vegas (Clark County), running 7-day cases deaths down, least. Overall Las Vegas currently stands 54.04 deaths per 100k population. That's bit per capita US national average 56.76. Upper limit 4000 IU problem right(for reference 230 lbs approx 13-15% bodyfat. NY well since peaked mid-April, numbers went straight stayed down. Even things started re-opening, even protests, spikes. Nothing’s gotten worse since pandemic. time see shitty is. america bro, this. sick mid-march still issues breathing. Doctor scheduled pulmonary specialist, took chest x-rays looked normal, thankfully.

Did lot mucus? constantly feel like mucus deep chest. That’s true flu, COVID 19 flu. It’s totally different kind virus. vaccines, immunity lasts many years even lifetime. shocked? know early Europeans turned white moved Africa don’t you? absorb sun faster since suns weaker here. skin dark built African climate suns rays stronger takes lot longer absorb western climate darker skinned people. BINGO! frequency shoddy, clickbait journalism pumping stories along lines ""things looking good experimental vaccines almost fade obscurity week now"" giving people false impression there's safe, functional vaccine right around corner need take what's happening seriously anymore. virtually nobody mainstream asking question *can't* vaccinate *can't* establish meaningful long term immunity...instead accepted given valid concerns can't help feel consequences behaving like could considerable turns we're wrong, factor approach take *right now* asking questions instead placing ouir hopes vaccine.

these 24-hour news cycle hacks need held accountable ignorance they're stoking, can't keep treating covid vaccine related news like bloody /r/futurism vaporware. same, take harsh asshole sometimes someone tell grandmother uncle surely going die covid face keep playing cards strangers. time, United States continues average 1,000 new deaths COVID-19 day, total number lives lost approaching 190,000 — highest death toll world. 2% death rate event alone. Decent sample size. Thanks info! There's huge public pressure places open bars- especially regions indoor dining already permitted. 

I understand governors tie hard data. Counties good %positive rate (or better yet clean data sewage testing) get bars open.  Deteriorating data automatically closes again. I’ve taking (liquid hell pill) years due malabsorption issues digestive track surgery 18 yrs ago caused bone density loss (post menopausal) . Started 50,000 IU day, monitored bloodwork, lowered 2 yrs 3x wk, 1x weekly. prescription, needs monitored blood level assessment 2x yr initially, annually. Fat soluble vitamin build fat cells toxic levels. ancient Egyptians point worshiping Ra? 21 works me. year wash anyhow! know border regions, Västerbotten seems unlikely effect all. Almost cases located along east coast, far away Norwegian border. r/covid-19 someone comments subject mentioned little data patients hospitalized.

My doctor scheduled see pulmonary specialist later month he's puzzled breathing. 6 months since sick, still days can't breathe. chest x-rays look normal, allergy medication helped all. sick, never developed shortness breath, cough. every symptom think of. ignorant even easier. mention Skeptoid podcast. think value anecdotes provided bleep blorp robot understand something happened somewhere doesn’t mean happened everywhere.

But equally dangerous idea something anecdote didn’t happen. Coronavirus subreddits banning people left right saying reinfection possible... day “discovered” yes FACT is.

Treating anecdotal evidence doesn’t exist totally unscientific, observation basis scientific process. Personally fear sort scientism people refuse believe things directly front dangerous equal superstition religion. Yes alot sun exposure, skin pigment, tons factors,,, work nights? live Greenland Cuba? come Greenland Cuba? get sunburn ice storm myself. different everyone. Person New York here, thank god we’re taking seriously debilitating month April. Still wearing masks everywhere go schools alternating days go 😷. places locked severely people allowed sun, stop spreading bullshit. Poverty extended family household structures. Paid agitation via trolls, bots/scripts pertinent social media ... new target!! There's really simple solution guys. put BLM t-shirts pretend protesting.. completely safe spread virus... according reddit media.. 3 dead attend wedding kinda provides independent support results third round infection prevalence study announced last week. \- source Swedish.

In short, read it, since April FHM makes round study every - send request/invitation participate several thousand households (random Sweden) people decide participate receive self-testing kits explanation take PCR sample (or take one kids, etc). April returned 0.9% positive samples, May returned 0.3% positive samples. latest round last week August, 2519 people 4000 participated single positive sample. wedding killed people, it’s safe say objectively useless human CONFIRMED deaths need feel depressed. Life mostly normal wear mask everywhere. Small inconvenience. That's it. cover vent thin loose cloth. protected 95% exhaled breath filtered everyone else's. take normal amount vit D. far know need quite lot it, DRI thought low. 

We used constantly sun out. Hunting, foraging working fields half naked. Dis here.......dis Maine Justice!  only! Thats point immunity short lasting look data - ignorant unwilling actually recognize vaccine effectiveness lasts month. often get downvoted well know fact ignore. Pretty sure Khmer Rouge UN seat taken 1991 go midday sun everyday. I’m sun day getting enough Vitamin sex marriage”

I always hard time believing people actually despite parents assuring did. caught spread it, severe make bit difference clearly taking precautions wait. long term affects damage worth avoiding possible far I'm concerned even kill ya. Bullshit. became political message big shit, sherlock article.

I one people nearly always happy. find joy everything &amp; even floundering this.

We need reopen. That's give moms sisters everynight. I’ve lived 6 yrs 1172 positive 11,000 tests. 10% USC students faculty currently infected. Given national positive test rates around 5.4%, thats quite large.

Source: Answer: it’s not. bloodwork done looking test results it’s listed 6% external enemies need keep stoking fire, we're happy destroying Idk, last time read article, said patients developing lung fibrosis. would interesting see body reversed within 3 months. Remember everybody dying scurvy learned eat oranges? miss pirate. think poster means daily cases dropped 17k decided open rather watching continue fall can, hospital enough plan ahead. Fuck. remember reading pandemic wasn’t ‘pandemic’ - father young boys truly scary ‘children men’ shit wish dark voices case could something them. tell nice things time. It’s apathy lack emotion truly getting me. went skydiving couldn’t even feel nerves untill exact moment jumped plane. feel indifferent fuck all. Maybe Chris Masterjohn taste:  merely cavalier one's health health around well. shows tremendous degree selfishness cruelty disregard possibility one's carelessness could bring harm everyone around fiancée date planned last June, move next June I’m still betting hiccups well 4 months ago wait least 7 days metabolize? People think distanced don’t need mask, mask don’t need distance.

Probably that's major message officials months now. can't count many times I've heard governor say ""social distancing, wearing mask situations social distancing possible"" something effect. I've never understood shit. Even amount space people COULD stay 6 feet apart whole time, actually going happen way people moving around. distance close. finally able get vitamin levels taking k D. numerous doctors never mentioned taking together Yes sir, cooks biggest part success making ever would pre Covid! "" faith "" conflicts health safety others day day lives, problem everyone. I'd imagine many breach contract. might simply playing odds couples fight it. 

Proving breach contract racks court costs, lawyer fees, great deal time effort. fees returned win, there's guarantee will. 

So, choices are:

1. Drop ~$3,000 pocket maybe 50/50 chance recover deposit (let's say $15,000). 
2. wedding anyway, salvage deposit
3. Wave good-bye deposit eat loss. 

All options suck. Hard. option 2 sucks tiny bit less two. wedding venues know this. 

Unless willing take venue court, scream, ""but mah contract!"" blue face good. Rhonda Patrick Phd recommends 4000IU good general starting dose.

I can't stand blowhard. He's new thing every months.

Before vitamin busy trying get sulforaphane broccoli sprouts efficiently. miracle drug going change world. 

The problem obsessive. good bad. goes drop hard one thing tends ignore stuff going hard something. 

You take information large grain salt. There's probably strong evidence truth blow titanic thing spewing. would skimping? Every additional semester spend university means they're generating additional semester's worth tuition revenue. anything, they're drawing milk students money.

And talking US case, world general. normal undergraduate engineering program last five years across developed world. at-home test kits process results home without send lab? unfortunately they'll charge 40... 


Did say 40, meant 400. 


Wait there's 4? 


That'll $22,000 plz hospitalized patients received best available therapy standard care, (per hospital protocol), combination **hydroxychloroquine** (400 mg every 12 hours first day, 200 mg every 12 hours following 5 days)

I wonder still give hydroxychloroquine spain. drug proven useless covid? thank god, ive popping flintstones like crazy want war, could control peoples lives. 

You want, spend free time want, meet want dres want. cares freedom, WAR! FUN ALLOWED BLOOD, SWEAT TEARS.

No thank you. keep comfy life. live, last day get proper dose mid aug, that's time 1 pm exactly. I've daily supplement decades bout shingles, protects possible neurological side effect. I'm entirely good news. 


A word caution, one fat soluble vitamins cannot quickly cleared toxic. technically bars still open, restaurants, drink bar also serving food (not appetizers).

This effect closing bars, allowing state better regulate restaurant industry.

some local bars (upstate NY) ignoring rules, got liquor licenses yanked promptly.

Gyms opened past week so, require masks times, 1/3 capacity (I think), Merv 13 air filtration, similar social distancing restrictions.  mean ''effect size''?

What would expect see ''critical care illness'' makes unbelievable?

We're talking preventative measures stop people getting critical care stage, critical care itself. think part problem hear US lot people believe COVID diagnose binary results - life death - it’s fact much complicated that. anyone die virus it’s UNPREDICTABLE. that’s said false. children died this, young ppl. never mentioned argued overall mortality among population, confirmed case fatality rate ICUP? That’s they’re saying. There’s suggestion anyone contracts COVID insufficient levels vitamin D. 

The person you’re replying discussing whether severity personal experience COVID, contracted it, influenced one way another individual vitamin level time. Yes that's article said. 


So, start vitamin today, need calcifediol week. anyone knew, high concentrations Vitamin could negligibly decreased short term effects massively increasing long term effects, give one possible example. point is, know, anyone else.

In fact, since single study, really know certain right need wait confirmation, although look encouraging.

If conclusive proof this, doctors would recommended far earlier, thing is, everyone mother putting miracle cures Joe Rogan *might* right pure chance special insight own.

Or put another way: disabling bomb say ""cut blue wire"", later turns right one, know pretty much guessed, still pissed me. idea Americans selfish. absolutely heart breaking. reduced deaths one-third patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.0% vs. 40.7%, RR 0.65 [95% CI 0.51 0.82]; p&lt;0.001), one-fifth patients receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (21.5% vs. 25.0%, RR 0.80 [95% CI 0.70 0.92]; p=0.002), reduce mortality patients receiving respiratory support randomization (17.0% vs. 13.2%, RR 1.22 [95% CI 0.93 1.61]; p=0.14). think issue taking highest dose bottle cause sharts, toxicity aside. mean increases calcium intake? vitamin supplement also calcium? vitamin makes body absorb calcium?
Any link reference article?
I'm especially interested 7 kidney stones life years (all?) either outside lot taking vitamin supplement. smart virus mutate deadly, can't spread kill host. It'd literally shooting foot. like. could’ve gotten side month individuals shouting “muh freedom” would actually quarantined month back nation locked down. government even paid us it. 

But September reason half population wondering it’s USA, Brazil, handful countries locked they’re blaming everyone themselves. evidence Trump followed Cuomo's lead (listen scientists, close hard, reopen meeting specific tested criteria) would far fewer sick Americans less death.

Instead, Trump bungled job (keep Americans safe) moronic sycophantic Republican governors followed (lack of) leadership. press release overview Karolinska Institute english. mentioned end - actual article link : ; article passed peer review accepted publication. Pre-printed proofs available read (but might edits connected printing final version, changes science article itself). 

41 children Italy MIS-C 10 Stockholm compared 28 children diagnosed Kawasaki COVID-19 pandemic. map differences similarities. 

SUMMARY 

SARS-CoV-2 infection typically mild often asymptomatic children. complication rare Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Children (MIS-C) associated COVID-19, presenting 4-6 weeks infection high fever, organ dysfunction strongly elevated markers inflammation. pathogenesis unclear overlapping features Kawasaki disease suggestive vasculitis likely autoimmune etiology. apply systems-level analyses blood immune cells, cytokines autoantibodies healthy children, children Kawasaki disease enrolled prior COVID-19, children infected SARS-CoV-2 children presenting MIS-C. find inflammatory response MIS-C differs cytokine storm severe acute COVID-19, shares several features Kawasaki disease, also differs condition respect T-cell subsets, IL-17A biomarkers associated arterial damage. Finally, autoantibody profiling suggests multiple autoantibodies could involved pathogenesis MIS-C. Yea find ways around it. ""cap"" ""X procedure usually costs $xxx, that's we're paying. hospital figure rest""

And hopefully go in-network hospital get in-network doctor try use procedure unapproved insurance company fight particular illness. 

They find way screw possibly can. group small statistically insignificant cannot really say effect Vitamin D2. instance country, cases, 3% need hospitalized ICU 5% need ventilator.

It rather appears correlation infectious dose severity disease. getting downvoted hope true. know shitloads candidate vaccines pre-produced hope everything checks pass trials, perhaps possible tens millions people could already vaccinated end 2020. Ideally many millions doses would going frontline essential workers risk catching spreading virus. that's case, think virus would hard pressed stay 1.0 R0 areas. started new job January excited. finished training going weekend shift, 12 hours day worked Friday, Saturday Sunday nights, got counted 40 hours. 

My plan get shift July, sign fall classes go school days week off, could get Machine Tool Tech degree try become toolmaker. 

But got laid April 🤷‍♀️ oh well

I interview tomorrow different factory though. looks like pays hopefully that’s right hopefully get it. 


Nahhh... There's several countries didnt deaths Sweden had, even saw less decline reverse also true: countries economic impact modest – like Taiwan, South Korea, Lithuania – also managed keep death rate countries similar falls GDP witnessed different death rates. instance, compare US Sweden Denmark Poland. four countries saw economic contractions around 8 9 percent, death rates markedly different: US Sweden recorded 5 10 times deaths per Good you. afraid show ignorance. AFAIK drawback mainly even huge pills cram much there, multivitamins tend insufficient amounts vitamin and/or forms well absorbed body (if they're trying save money). Although may good shitty diet, otherwise recommended individually supplement vitamins deficient in, probably less expensive. surviving right success. feel human isolated. well. There's one thing factoring here. Office buildings nyc yet reopened. highly susceptible people papers talk probably case essential workers. soon offices would reopen would suddenly large group people together immunity would probably way low make work. tell long last? month? 2 months? 6? year??
Just know time frame time spent finding out? aaah, thanks noticing that! fixed  mean, knew that, didn’t realize three four times more. still amounts three four hours week, still, TIL. Sorry, that's correct. Vitamin synthesized skin sun, UV-light changes precursor molecule vitamin D. reason people brown/dark skin vitamin melanin skin protects agains UV-light, time inhibits vitamin synthesis skin. secret outdoor surface transmission really uncommon. get virus hanging indoors extended periods time without masks ventilation. People socializing gathering NYC time, even violating rules, everything outdoors people getting virus. Lots people going beyond comfort zone, hanging outdoor bars without masks (after ordering one sandwich, it’s technically meal), appears safer anyone admit. Government restrictions apparently somewhat lax, provided everyone understands cardinal avoid-indoors rule.

I read people still staying inside day every day except grocery run every two weeks wiping groceries. you, especially you’re chemo something, certainly looks like level personal restriction waste time.

I’m worried happens cold weather hits couple months, heat lamps get us December maybe light end tunnel then.  way know blood level without going bloodwork? reduction death would 100%. infinity, dividing deaths control group 2. surprising familiar research COVID/Vitamin-D : effect size indirectly acting medication beyond anything see critical care illness...ever. get vitamin levels tested? US backing development multiple vaccines US likely see first doses said vaccines countries. Australia one many countries placing pre-order AstraZeneca vaccine ...from Daily Telegraph, telling us get back work days ago.

Unless see confirmed peer reviewed, I'll assume another lie ongoing campaign bolster profits central London landlords. visit old people, common sense. try pose risk vulnerable population can. things think fine, like bars, casinos, gyms, theaters, concerts, etc etc attract old people. ramp infections lot without many people dying among right population. 

Also equivalence years lost one life. number may differ loss quality life compares lives lost conversion rate. example comes point take small chance death versus locked prison year. Again, number may differ willing take certain chances death improvement life. like medical system weighs money versus lives example spending tax money expensive medicines rare corner cases money better effectively spent elsewhere. rocket science even uncommon practice, willing acknowledge it. find hard believe. type response would expect specific antibiotic bacterium. indirect mechanisms Vitamin basically reverse/cure Covid-19 critical illness seems like one extraordinary things could ever see. Yea buddy. Stay away people, win war. upset want also keep whatever want. war, humanity people's health. 

And yea, know masterming, thanks that. would downside calcifediol keeps supplements? expensive? preserve well? relate totally. work healthcare Miami. ppe. barely gloves go around. gloves often like clear “school lunch” gloves call them. literally says medical use box. it’s either gloves. Pre COVID medical gloves unlimited boxes. Now, nothing.       

Oh also unspoken policy job supply mask. job doesn’t provide masks, Miami it’s required. buy shit. Welcome America healthcare 2020. Sweden Danish rule. shared king, ruled country national government. assuming refer Kalmar union slightly 100 years, rather short period Swedish history. Absoutely brilliant. 

Like, leave quarantine area, definitely die know are. Leave plenty supplies heat / comfort, monitor via video daily check-ins otherwise leave it. blame Trump. Doesn’t mean Joe Rogan source.  Alright, study done patients intensive care already COVID-19.

Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromyecin, specialized version Vitamin supplement used POTENTIALLY reduce time needed ICU.

The study also went 63 patients ICU Spain, 50 given Calcifediol. One 50 still needed ICU, 13 control released two passed away. indication prior medical history individual’s ages question backgrounds.

I wouldn’t call breakthrough, causality. studies need done. also done healthy people determine efficacy. little causality increasing Vitamin levels keep getting COVID-19, hospitalized, dying complication related disease. BEST. YET. COME

please vote Although plenty blame go around government response, agree people get choice. People always choice. Sweden left largely people since beginning, they're near double digit daily cases whole country days. usually small. Cofins things, things die. don’t disagree. point person replied stated “tiny percentage”. I’ve seen practice, simply untrue read more. included studies highly heterogenous also several included show significant dependencies vit. sunscreen use. could grasp full text (just copy study name Google scholar, find pdf), tried get away artificial uv light used older studies order see vit. blocking effect persists natural light conditions.
However, could read (bathroom breaks work limited time), majority studies identified used real life setting instruction ppl use sunscreen ""controlled"" way (protocol driven). condition, blocking effect sunscreen significant anymore.

HOWEVER, data less tells ""during normal life, apply sunscreen extended periods time sun, negatively influence vit. levels."" But, conditions, virtually impossible fully control everything. me, deficit looks like sunscreen blocks vit. production, effect matter still normal life standard outdoor activities.

So would say sunscreen block it, would say matter normal life sunscreen time.

I reckon better study would use true sunlight exposure similar way older studies used artificial light.

Winter coming. Less obesity, less old people, less testing, outdoor time vitamin d? Masks, washing hands social distancing worth it?


Also many ""non essential"" businesses low income countries have?  Would limiting restaurants bars really huge effect?


And thousands people getting sick weeks, many needing hospitalization, dieing affect economy?

Mostly /s broke start Covid stuff circling lower lower depression funk. thought putting effort dating makes sort want vomit. NYC less open anywhere else north east PA, NJ, surrounding states, cases climbing. Also mask usage percent less per capita Philadelphia cases also climbing. 

I think herd immunity best credible theory. Les miserables Sweden, we’ve forced quarantine we’ve fine that. it’s already circulating around UK rest world don’t see use putting travellers quarantine. virus become part world it’s impossible eliminate it. Lol kidding look news given day.   Apparently Nazis taken USA destroy everything unless give specific people power.  Science is: mask help little, might worse. Immunity thing, that’s happening NY, London Sweden. 

But mask help thinking stoping it, use it. control immunity. Meth kills boredom Still hand waving away peer-reviewed research you're""oh-so smart"" know better. zero evidence presented vaccine candidates even potentially dangerous. wear mask side effects.If take coronavirus vaccine don’t know side effects could facing couldn’t sue manufacturer any.  Wait, surely excess deaths includes Covid deaths? would leave 20,000 deaths directly attributable Covid, would undiagnosed Covid, would Covid-adjacent - e.g. people avoided getting medical care due fear Covid, kind thing.

Since coronavirus pandemic started, public health officials United States faced harassment death threats, even driven office. university deeply involved studying virus warned hundreds researchers lookout dangerous packages.

Last Monday, University Washington, based Seattle, sent email 500 researchers telling wary suspicious packages saying virus researchers elsewhere targeted.

A University Washington spokeswoman, Susan Gregg, provided copy university’s email New York Times said suspicious packages reported far.

The email warned researchers lookout signs suspicious mail, including address misspelled words, return address, oily stains, discoloration strange odor. mail raised concerns, email said, left unopened reported police calling 911.

Research University Washington includes 16 clinical studies related virus prominent sometimes criticized forecasting model. model estimated last week Covid-19 would kill 410,000 people United States end year, double current death toll, drawing skepticism experts said predictions course pandemic months future uncertain useful.

The report threats researchers follows earlier signs risks faced public health officials others involved pandemic response. Dr. Anthony Fauci, member President Trump’s virus task force nation’s leading expert infectious diseases, received additional security April threats, said security also expanded daughters. Local state health officials also targeted challenging public health measures.  even really doubt point schools opening disaster? Nothing makes sense anymore, news number infections schools opened yet none places seem deciding obviously best to. seems common sense done ol' ""You stay I'm outta here"". It’s like us even access vaccine immediately anyhow. time they’ve produced enough doses non-essential ass getting enough time see really safe not. anyone actually going flee whatever part country well covid, I’d think people would probably last you’d worry far kicking cases NE.

Luckily infection rather mild. Myalgia, sore throat, fever days... really it... kids actually got sicker Except incivility allowed... problem proven time people take responsibility, mandatory.

People allowed take responsibility instead treated like babies adult supervision. Lol sure? Well herd immunity theoretically achieved speak, possibly asymptomatic infected people.

So... already, made Feb., able site evidence ""knew VD"". hundreds hypotheses different compounds there. used standard evidence point, could make argument strong them. let's keep going:

4) observational study. need said correlation equal causation. 1,000 different possible explanaitons relationship. Again, reason perform actual trial, absolutely evidence VD supplementation efficacious acute management COVID-19.

Normally, develop vaccines diseases certain ""encounter rate"". normally takes years enough vaccinated volunteer encounter disease generate evidence vaccine effectiveness. Covid spreading quickly areas world process greatly accelerated. sense, vaccine trial rushed, evidence generated much faster rate vaccination efforts. aint good news Oh knows. hit hard COVID, knows first hand dangers.

Cheating bros common practice. exact number people may kill profit zero. usually use “population immunity.”

Either way, phrase “herd immunity” makes people go crazy He's either trolling literally understand word contagious means Since March taking high doses Vitamin supplements real sun good?  Consequences sure, wanting people get disease kill you? hell? Oh, no, admit anything... extended family. sound like lib scientists believe came monkeys

/s actual thing evangelical family said Really, stay idiotic sub bothers much. What’s point going back forth you’re POV clearly outnumbered here. makes sense. world without politicians would much better place Nearly **twice high** official death toll attributed COVID. real situation Mexico much worse numbers indicate, part due extremely low testing rates 

edit - Mexico 50-60% test positivity rate! grandma one, really warm ridiculously heavy get following Calvinists' way study. England 'enforced' (even loosely) locked area think.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lot places allow masks. Crazy right. 1 - idea herd immunity requires 70-80% taken seriously epidemiological community point. Multiple peer-reviewed published studies shown assumption people equally likely receive spread, inherent formula came number, incorrect. 

We still aren’t sure exactly number is, something 40 60% becoming common range estimates.

2 - herd immunity means virus stops entirely outside localized flare-ups. didn’t say that. said would slow Typically gets digested waste pushed bodies.  Worst country world, selfish ugliest people! Yeah think herd resistance much useful term contexts outright herd immunity people power thought way...

The 73-year-old initially believed swindle. became curious took cheque bank. bank initiated investigation found cheque really US government.

Shortly afterwards money account

Three days later money also transferred 73-year-old's bank account. received special government payment US retirees mystery him. suspects 1960s, graduating high school, went trip America worked waiter almost two years.

But wife also received $1,200 cheque, never USA. Upper Austria, Linz retired couple isolated case. 45 cheques already cashed savings bank Upper Austria. Raiffeisen-Landesbank Oberösterreich, 63 already cashed.

The US President giving away US taxpayers' money pensioners Europe. nice guy. gotta stab three times?! research shows giving people small dose vitamin-d (2000IU) prevent people getting seasonal influenza. 

We might eventually find true COVID.... Thank posting this. nasty case Covid still unable work 6 months later. It’s struggle including financially help lot. many postulations cures remedies come out? gonna hand guy time might’ve guessed right. hope Ontario crowd source like know Ford Lecce trying keep hush hush. Fuck Murdoch.

Hope find self stability though  dumb, based nothing lies believe opinion, yes, twat Thanks - corrected it. Zagazig Univ.

Which leads question history tongue twister.

Evidently city name located lower Egypt called al-zaqaziq - slightly better - Egyptians pronounce Q G (Arabic pronunciation variation) - wound الزقازيق‎ University, one largest universities Egypt, also located city, colleges different fields science arts. Archaeological Museum University Zagazig exhibits significant finds nearby sites, Bubastis (Tell Basta) Kufur Nigm.[2] Also branch Al-Azhar University, largest Islamic university city found 19th century place village called Nazlat az-Zaqāzīq named Zaqzuq family. family's name comes form dialectal word zaqzuq ziqziq means ""a small creature"" (e.g. fish mouse) comes Coptic word ""ant insect"". possible, seems unlike. You’re downvoted people don’t know they’re talking about. People without deficiencies need take vitamins. vitamin D, go fuck outside lol don’t need take pill it. Thank request, comrade.

u/G00dcoffee said N-word. Wow word isn’t civil offends someone reddit /u/nwordcountbot don’t domestic manufacturing capacity make n95 masks here. Much difficult process making easy surgical cloth masks. Takes months months receive equipment retool. it’s cheap. scarce melt blown fabric critical part mask. don’t make too. 

There articles say shortages n95 last til next year. item cannot mass produced. 

Blame politicians greedy hospital ceos buying medical supplies domestically shipping manufacturing jobs overseas. thing happened went wedding 100 people zero masks dancing. Luckily one got sick nervous shut-in two weeks afterwards. No, one agrees that. what, expressing opinion? Joe rogan 2 months ago. Joe Rogan literally saying vitamin since March. Double twat Make sure talk Dr. taking much, long keep up.

Taking higher normal doses Vitamin increase calcium intake lead kidney stones, really something want avoid getting. Thank you. feel current president cares American people all. makes profoundly sad.    According Trump though lot happening right would actually Biden's America  include getting Vitamin sun? went outdoor wedding 60 people couple weeks ago one contracted covid-19 . outside plenty room spacing. escitalopram (lexapro) 6 years.

I recently weaned it. 

For 3 months felt worst getting it. made loopy, made woozy, got moody, worse actual anxiety took alleviate. 

I'm feeling amazing now, getting married love life next year, first born due 3 weeks, life could never better. furloughed five half months finally went back past Tuesday. half office back, people super edge, morale low, everyone extremely worried going close again. due respect, disagree. personal opinion vis-a-vis compare economy loss due let diseases spread like wild fire(to achieve called 'Herd Immunity') versus effort expenditure contain spread incomparable. Further, former process, many precious lives would lost. personally firmly believe Honorable Indian Govt. implicitly attempting former('Herd Immunity'). see significant changes public health sector either State Central level. China built hospital war-footing. India people struggling get Oxygen therapy. so-called ""Make India"" ventilators failed. Alas, working home, volunteering, paying taxes, can't much individual trying express opinions concerns platform hoping concerned Govt. authorities would listen. know far fetched reality, optimistic. Reported different form body creates form get supplements. Takes 7 days convert fully.

So supplements still give need.  typed long message somehow show yes can. read see no, cannot.
Everyday entrenched Trump church.
Everyday Trump gets view others less human traitors criminals coming guns.
I've told faith God alone, guns God. Everyday helping benefit them. hurts. Agree: audience susceptible. 

Would less case invested (beginning 60 years ago) public education, especially science, health, government, developing skills like critical thinking? rural schools US deplorable since least 70s. 

A staggering amount tax-payer money spent weapons-development. we’d diverted even 5% public school education, we’d population less apt fall errant nonsense. agree then, lockdowns bad... probably killed people? able anything socially? overwhelmed pandemic? I'm sorry. long time. alone. nothing? Finnair lot flights Q1. yes wuhan managed isolate quite well prohibited

So what, new clubs open old industrial warehouse spaces factories upon time. Funny, back March lockdowns started drunks social circle kept fooling sharing links articles said getting drunk would protect Covid...  drunks anything justify habit. Twat venue made us pay entire fee. Pretty shit thing say Student yours. could feel unwelcome semester. He's learn Teacher never anything negatively impact that. telling somewhere human history started cover skin textiles therefore reduced vitamin production evolutionary mechanism mammals...fascinating signs willful ignorance stupidity Makes shutting old people indoors depriving important source vitamin look even stupid too. even covid. New Study: Vitamin can't found...... anywhere. Lol. Joe Rogan preaching months! If!!!! You!!!! Actually!!!! Cared!!!! Instead!!! Of!!!! Just!!!! Trolling!!!! That!!! Information!!!! Has!!!! Been!!!! Freely!!!! Available!!!! For!!!! A!!!! While!!!! Now!!!! funny present fact without evidence. ""It obvious bro. study abroad bro, know country studied there.""

Yeah, greater shame someone like allowed study all, given complete disregard facts. might T-cell immunity. analysed, easily. hard believe? seems late bandwagon but... 
Winter coming! all. schools open next week Ontario. well, think we're verge really messing up, n'est-ce pas?

I miss 2019, lol. think aware possibility huge! worst first unprepared. really difficult labor &amp; delivery baby reflux sleep, cried time. went pretty bad spiral literally one noticed. remember one time sister came watch let sleep laid bed cried hour, pretended everything fine. 

The hardest part way brain tricks thinking can't ask help, bad mom (at least case me). would push husband away got home work tried take over, convinced one could take care baby (even though also convinced total failure)

Anyway - think took probably 6-8 weeks asked help. family took turns coming giving breaks. second new baby prepared talked doctor beforehand. able get husband's FMLA extended home help longer, family knew might struggling checked pretty frequently. 

PPD/PPA definitely real scary let put kids. Talk doctor partner plan place. instance, recent birth sure would family support COVID chart could call get prescription zoloft needed it. Good luck! Former COVID-19 patient here, confirm. 

I issues stamina almost 2 months symptoms cleared, (almost almost 6 months later) pretty much symptoms gone except chronic cough I've always had. Suncreen prevent body producing vitamin though According candidates document, UQ vaccine requires 2 doses explains 51m doses ordered country 25m. Oxford/AstraZeneca requires 1 seen reporting 2nd booster may required show low immune response. Little late party ... really think car salespeople make thousands dollars auto sale hyperbole? Unless used car unlikely even 1000 gross profit salesperson gets cut gross profit.

Then, lets talk average amount time takes complete auto sales. minutes? That's fantasy. sold cars 10 years fastest transaction ever still took 30 minutes average sale took several hours.

I get point scale motivation way off. ?

Get outside god sake. Every activity small grand scheme things though. sum parts though lead far greater spread. Huge events full heaps people biggest spreaders like wedding day enormous protests hundreds thousands gathering together. clearly pointless say can't visit family others allowed gather groups 50,000 lead non compliance restrictions. Psychopathy heritable trait, accurately diagnosed MRI. Sociopathy trait typically develops consequence trauma. difference two sociopaths typically inner circle quite capable empathizing, empathy towards outsiders. Psychopaths physically incapable empathy, actually emulate emotions, perhaps exception real basic ones like anger. overwhelming majority real successful corporate executive types psychopaths. Yep changed luck Ewliminated truth uni students wont pay money online experience university. social aspect university one main aspects people unable even campus, would pay 9 grand go way worse experience year. people know would defer reject place allowed go campus year someone going university weeks, gone allowed campus.

Obviously I'll whatever told terms keeping others safe I'm also going pay 9 grand online lessons. live uk people mostly want, people family meet family see friends pretty much friends everynight, also bare mind live city supposed local lockdown. So, think reality now, least England, people going really listen restrictions anymore want. So, close universities really make sense people age group already travelling around country going clubs pubs. left house since March due chronic illness can't risk it. Everything gets delivered cleaned arrives nobody visit. That's really good observation figures low, can't take absolute values statistically significant - one small localized outbreak double numbers overnight. need look trends much longer period properly average that, numbers remain stable.

I check figures - key understanding epidemiology works. What?

What makes think can’t go outside ridiculous. country decided loosen open schools... 6k 2 weeks.. getting downvoted? must primary cause. Sweden, people wearing masks, going ride subway. Yet, small increase cases ICUs around 10-20 nationwide. made students sign agreement get covid, can't sue universities, university close later due ""unforeseen"" circumstances, refunds.

Will even hold court shown coercion and/or deception?  need reasoned, scientific/sociological discussions actually achievable goals return normal. Eventually restaurants going full capacity, eventually people socialize eventually kids need back face face school. feel like stuck group people want everything open tomorrow ECONOMY also seems subset people think eliminate this.

Even vaccine going endemic. goals? acceptable infection/death rate get stay there? Wtf they're definitely open quite obvious, rather useless point protests caused cases. What’s exactly point made? 

That narrative pushed says precisely opposite that. Including you. leople staying home decreases cases people protesting narrative reverse falsely pushed politics. That’s one measure success, sure. Flattening curve first goal, US definitely that.  wsws.org may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* nobody tell KN95 masks? Basically thing buy Amazon. would cases imported china? virus practically gone there. left America. anyone idea translates taking prophylactic vitamin supplement regimen?

I mean, much someone take day? think relevant talk world averge. country never really hit corona course gonna smaller numbers anyway. Countries dosen't register corona deaths also gonna smaller numbers. need look excess data aswell. Based numbers see indications underreportering lots countries. Therefore shouldt making definite conclusions badly Sweden done compared countries looking deaths per million alone. put shut up. I've moved new country, too. american every one ancestors moved new country. sort authors suggesting, population slicing urban/rural, age groups. another similar article written, gist working population go world gets infected higher rate age groups, turn main spreaders. working population reaches actual herd immunity, 60, 70 80% whatever is, without broadly spreading populations, populations protected, thus “average” infection rate needed herd immunity across entire population would much lower, like 31%.

Not buying selling personally, especially countries multi-generational households norm, countries norm, multi-generational households rise. can’t see working population realistically getting herd immunity populations age group live low infection rate average 1%. yesterday articles majority young adults USA living parents, countless studies increasing sandwich generation Great Recession.

Besides, even could firewall working population olds kids, tough sell working age population keep working isolation keep economy going, also take one team terms population possibly dying long term health problems. Everything awesome, everything cool part team... Alarming... mean. virus fatigue since May. Everyone thought we’d done now. 

Even best us wearing thin. I’m certainly tired wearing mask 8 hours day work. 

BUT. also is. know one I’ll keep plowing we’re ,am. starting grow old. Every one depressed before. 

We’ve constantly bombarded messages photos Social Media last 10 years telling us don’t good lives. Since start pandemic, thought maybe start taking vitamin immune system. Seems like made right call Australia quietly led COVID-19 rational response despite leadership that’s similar US  Yes, I’ve heard lot deciding stay children pod learning therefore buying houses possibly returning city. sure like beach town, locals can’t wait like every year travelers leave, esp pandemic year. rich enough rent summer, either still interested buying can’t afford buy already coming back city. It’s also annoying act like single handedly rescue city despair, it’s like homie backbone hard workers allow city function 24.7 remained sustain businesses ones kept going. Don’t get started that’s messed private school pods terrible wealth education gap this. We’re still shortages PPE hospitals here, way we’re seeing vaccine year yet alone free one enough debate pro-socialist non-monetary society, bother. man-made need money, security, that's keeping vegas open.

Food thought financial innovation equally important human advancement technical advancement. allowed people move small self sustained villages large cities. standard currency relied barter system inefficient allowed little spare time science like. youre goat farmer trade goat bread? cant split goat. also dont need 30 pieces bread goat obviously worth loaf bread. Currency adds liquidity goods services different values. Right?! hurt bad :D They're literally downvoting data. bit hard believe dont even know impact 20 years yet. also surge heart attack deaths 911 calls heart attacks NYC correlated perfectly spike COVID deaths. believe correct. Maybe toss pinch greed flavor goulash.

Shells used currency buy Manhattan. deal.

I surrender. fucking hate winter. Exactly. hard time understanding everyone even mention getting votes. It’s nothing controversial, it’s fight viruses long rung. It’s standard epidemiology. Hint, mask isn’t. No, he's way off.  Maybe talk doc Methylfolate, especially antidepressants worked you. might MTHFR gene mutation I'm going pretend understand/remember science on, makes depression harder treat, apparently supplementing methylfolate helps.

I'm willing talk whatever want. know else obstacle? one shall named subreddit Germany, mostly. collateral damage gets largely swept rug. even humans, twin birth happens wrongly... idea terrifying crazy feels like month two ago talking possible second wave summer. summer come gone. Well Mexico Individualistic, yet suffer (according Hofstede Insights ) Vaccine: late 2020 early 2021

Widely available vaccine: early mid 2021 assume worst study done yet. assuming, based absolutely nothing, 1 1000 children heart damage. standing assumption proof. could assume 1 10 children's legs fall next year, scientific standing theory simply know yet.

The fact HUGE majority (way, way 999 1000) children end hospital, gives credence idea 1 1000 heart problems. Intelligent people risk averse? can’t take anything else said seriously. used lie bed dream human race expanding earth stars surviving eons. lie bed pray don’t get leave planet sun takes us. species don’t deserve it.

Bit dramatic, huh?  Summary

These Zigizag Univ, Iraq study results. clinical trial link above, detailed PDF report results given below. study significant relates community transmission infectivity, well treatment (active possibly prophylactic) across age groups (similar results across age groups).


This seems significant study - showed effect ivermectin given families infected (RT-PCR positive test) member. reduced development symptoms hugely.

From ""Follow up"" section first pages, one see tested RT-PCR developed symptoms. CT scans symptomatic also recorded side-effects (side effects given clinicaltrials link - gastro etc took ivermectin).

And within 14 days 7.4pct close family members developed ivermectin vs 58.4pct non-ivermectin group. results similar across age groups ie helped all.

In addition reduced infectivity period ie non-ivermectin group kept infecting longer.

Dosage ivermectin given day 1 day 3 (2 days) - day dose standard dose:

40-60kg person - 15mg per day
60-80kg person - 18mg per day
greater 80kg - 24mg per day


You could say prophylaxis plus suppression nascent disease study - since first family member detected may already infected family members (usually large close-knit families). Iraqi family structure probably gives heightened infection rate - family numbers larger give magnified result - helps study give robust results (larger numbers) fewer families (I think total families 50 - ie index cases tracked families 50).

Sorry rant... comment felt like best place vent things haven’t able say anyone.

I hope family figure things out. Two different uses meanings behind word. Chimera anime derived Greek mythology origins creature composed physical characteristics serpent, lion, goat. Chimera terms scientific terms, specifically genetics, one organism composed two different sets genetic material (DNA RNA Covid specifically) therefore develop two different organisms. Think seeing flower split one side red side white. two distinct sets genetic material produces outward physical color phenotype see eyes! Either way, word rocks severely underused 🙃 99% people seek greatness fail. make either incredibly lucky incredibly determined.

Vitamin-D magnesium work synergisticaly goes need Mg. 

I would suggest supplementing magnesium (not oxide) week try taking vitamin-D again. Sounds legit.

Q: post wearing mask causes carbon dioxide toxicity gone viral FB. get info from?

A: FB. Right I've pretty down. shut isolation far tell. shitty half response government, somehow, people okay it. people, life. 

I guess I'm saying responses crisis given clear look kind people life, people would normally keep life. keep retesting people, start testing people unlikely virus ... positivity rate go even proportion infected stays same.

That's point. resorting testing people unlikely virus means finding people otherwise found, use positive result ensure transmit anyone else. number actually infected stays (but future transmission drop due cases detected otherwise), case numbers static rising slowly testing, likely simply capturing bigger share smaller pool infected. Good guy, China. I'm afraid global issue, I'm expert see many sad people world used to... Great calculations That's like sober person, forced take one seat lacks safety belt. quite possible taking would rougher battle hospitalized, and/or faced longer recovery period. happens *all* time.  get fired liking boss’s Facebook post wearing unmatched socks.

Doesn’t illegal.  

And kicked college putting risk bad representative school, doesn’t illegal. thing every case China quite widely published, live city recently cases, know details said case, contract tracing taken seriously. think attempt hide cases otherwise whole thing falls apart pretty quickly. I'd happy proved wrong seriously doubt it. Maybe medium shift online celebrities game never changes. already see generation obsessed YouTube, twitch, Instagram, tik tok etc. could thing people serious case flu pneumonia. sure news. Viruses fuck up, common sense. Exactly. anti-covid brigade think they've found another ""gotcha"" prove hoax planned, made look like able think analytically. 200 k lol peak come begin hitting Herd Immunity, assuming thing. Nothing slow till expect. went catholic grade school. go mass every school day lent except Friday stations cross. brutal age. used try arrive right tardy time could stand back get yelled signing loud enough. Oh fucks sake, situation nothing ""bad genes"". Thailand suffered 12% drop GDP. healthy population, lots sunlight Vitamin D, good healthcare system country income band, would out-performed global death average. I'm saying worth it, I'm sure cost per life saved would spend save life road accidents (especially dangerous roads world). You’re quite cold-hearted asshat, aren’t you?

We choice use immense wealth nation prop nation’s economy go full shutdown save lives. mention god-awful side-effects people recover. Like lung damage, heart damage, rest.

But jackasses like can’t see immense wealth. live scarcity mindset says every person themselves. fuck care people, right? Dumbest possible way looking this.

If poorer countries things like nationalize payroll roll temporary UBI people, USA sure fuck get year two. WOULD destroy CONSUMER BASED economy. “economic destruction” saw top 20% earners country. bottom 80%. instead helping many, chose few. laughing stock world people continue risk health billionaires make money less fortunate continue monetarily fucked.

You need revisit values seriously reconsider think values country be. “everybody themselves” mindset can’t handle properly. It’s horseshit. totally possible forced way, original commenter named people thinking way sinophobes. ""OMG we're going die children permanently disabled?""

Can’t find better non-remote job watch 4 year old everyday since there’s school daycare open here. Remote job positions aren’t responding, regardless many places apply. I’ve self employed last years it’s paying bills anymore unemployment. quite sure get it.  Yep. Headline total bullshit. Anecdotal know, work long night shift indoors. coworkers diagnosed Vitamin deficient, already taking supplements. day shifts keep Covid 19 flare ups, far one night shifts symptoms it. doesn’t stop getting it, helps disease symptoms less severe.

You really shouldn’t go around calling people silly haven’t even bothered actually read comments. Hypocrite. one pharma companies wants vaccine first approved big money. knows behind scenes whether rushing not. Nope cause country live half decides ""I want wear mask infringes rights"" fuck lost dad Covid-19 almost lost mom. Fuck everyone wear mask gut issues reduce absorption like IBS, Celiac etc. go back worshipping celebrities athletes distract mundane economically enslaved lives.

You sure? illusion breaking point impossible bring back. We're exhausted narcissistic pigheaded Faux News vidiots. 12.5% us population infected. Still lot people left infected, worry time vaccine arrives enough americans taken it.....we already close 50% people infected

I think first set numbers plausible, though high side.

How get there, three times many infected availability vaccine though? Europe + UK seems omitted list strong holds... matter. quick google suggests slight bigger problem that:

But measures still miles away say Belgium. People allowed move freely outside however long wanted outside, military patrolling streets fines taking walk without permit. definitely didn’t go full Chinese lockdown military police welding people’s doors shut couldn’t leave. 

They shut travel capital region week, though. That’s thing separates rest Nordics. accept protests cause infection surge? We’ve testing people like crazy, maybe 10 people entire unit test positive since began. 

Quarantining, mask wearing social distancing norm, part. cough? Okay here’s quarantine slip, go get tested 7 days let us know results are. believe anything comes China. legit.

Turns masks protect others, others you. And, masks let small dose virus produces asymptomatic infection body gets extra days recognise fight virus due low amount virus entering body. much higher proportion asymptomatic patients (they even know COVID) death rates low.

The sunshine helps killing residual virus surfaces, true May upto mid June. 

Now, media stopped news COVID, life moves economy politics important apparently, everyone thinks stopped wearing masks, cops stopped enforcing fines, due number 2 challenging number 1 strongly.

There surprises anymore, disappointments.  St Johns Wort really dangerous people. Probably, still positivity rate 5% - 4× higher NY.

That's halved last couple weeks, seems testing much ever - numbers definitely falling positivity rates also falling. 

In words, seems likely infections community going right direction, much higher base level previously reported. good news comparing Florida's stats; probably tell anything prevalence infection Florida vs. NY — similar populations, testing similar numbers, Florida reporting 3-4 times cases, suggesting threshold getting test higher Florida NY, meaning cases going undetected. talking U.S. Let's stay topic.

And changed topic compare US response rest world. Let's stay topic issue comes PPE

That's true all. US hospitals really hurting money right fucked insurance system makes elective procedures bring money, they've mostly stopped due mostly really hard get things.

I'm partly pedant here, partly informative: /r/COVID19 papers Vitamin B also factor quicker recovery better outcomes. And, read, need vitamin K certain proportion vitamin order help process get side effects (calcification?). obviously Vitamin C that's used half treatment get COVID.

You may think: ""what older people they're going give to"".

And would reply older people shielding, otherwise death rate low.

What's better:

1. young people getting COVID, contributing herd immunity, old people shielded
2. everyone shielded

Restaurants bars NYC still outdoor I’m fairly certain parts state indoor dining indoor activities now. large New York, New Jersey, Connecticut done good job following rules abiding restrictions. might seem expensive solution one idea might completely separate air supply different groups diners come in. table would glass ""bubble"" different air filtration system. servers could slide entrees slot--kind like prison--preventing server exchanging air patrons. I’m entirely sure I’m following here....masks don’t create exactly? NY phase 4. Shopping centers, malls, gyms, restaurants open masks reduced capacity. Except, even effective vaccine depends study defines “infection.”

I can’t find info Pfizer one, Moderna Phase 3, I’m bit concerned including asymptomatic cases, especially given recent research suggests even asymptomatic cases cause long term damage meet certain efficacy threshold. study defines “getting COVID” certainly affect that. definition certainly gets 50% lot faster, even though we’re seeing someone less sick end long term damage. *Slide **Primary Efficacy Endpoint: COVID-19 Disease Case considered case COVID-19 evaluation Primary Efficacy Endpoint, two criteria must 1. participant must experienced   - least TWO following systemic symptoms: fever (≥ 38oC), chills, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory taste     - least ONE following respiratory signs/symptoms: cough, shortness breath difficulty breathing, clinical radiographical evidence AND
       2. participant must least one NP swab, nasal swab saliva sample (or respiratory sample, hospitalized) positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR

With said:

Is covid cases linked one wedding? 

And 56 cases county total 9 countied 56 cases?

Again, I'm totally open changing opinion based information provided, really 56 cases 9 counties that's pretty low standard. There's also way knowing people attended even cases admitted.. people volunteer information. careful withdrawals symptoms ever change medication, bad. India imposed lockdown early around 300-500 total lockdown cases bold move government due lack fo planning sudden announcement lockdown, millions daily wage workers stranded road without work even without shelter. 
And July, cases million, lockdown restriction decreased ease economy almost whole country open 3 10 people found wearing masks, start, numbers go huge may chances gonna take position 1 maybe mid October Double ill believe Live CA, confirm. States general great job enforcing reopening schedules based state health departments.

Intervene - come way hindrance get saying, eventually large enough fraction population COVID infection levels die somewhat steady state.

However, think non-standard usage term ""herd immunity?""

If go back pre-COVID, would hear term ""herd immunity"" used talk disease like measles, immune compromised rely enough people vaccinated get it. 

I recall ever applied diseases _didn't_ vaccine for.

For many years vaccines measles, mumps, small pox, chicken pox, polio ... people describing situation ""herd immunity?""

I think like lived level infection really choice. Getting measles, mumps, chicken pox, something happened kids grew up. recall anyone using ""herd-immunity"" describing situation.

I think term ""herd immunity"" recently coopted make idea making without vaccine sound better really is. accepting certain level infection.

The happy, horny, skinny pill. I’m going graduating four years. Two years leaves two years accomplish things apply grad school jobs. lockdown goes long, I’ll nothing live for. I’ll become worthless shitstain accomplished nothing life. I’ll loser. #justiceserved Sorry Miss Jackson I’m OP, but: 

I really worried well, I’ve dealing anxiety/depression entire life. husband knew PPD possibility, talked would if/when happened. made sure find medication could take throughout pregnancy, talked extensively doctors pregnant. Making phone calls tough me, even made sure write contact info OB, PCP, psychiatrist, therapist case husband call. plan helped feel control situation almost control. 

I wind getting baby #2, husband knew keep eye called team soon saw spiraling control.

The shitty thing is... last August. Around January, finally felt like again. back work, baby getting easier... then, bam, coronavirus hits USA March. traded postpartum anxiety/depression fun new covid anxiety/depression. 27.8% surveyed least one symptom depression. compares 8.5% people 2017 2018. Sweat lot horny? Wellbutrin? pill form? I’ve seen paste, give horses dewormer. interesting. post relates threats scientists developing vaccines coronavirus face. 

How relate directly coronavirus associated outbreak? 

Ya’ll idiots. Seriously. realize available yet. Went Dr follow appointment last week asked wanted flu shot. Yes! Sign That’s bummer! Brazil cool spots! :( No, entire stance he's trying interfere. original context mine well. one twisting you. Sorry reading comprehension issues. death per case rate significantly lower coming. departure normally tight-lipped health officials, Thursday's news conference state Director Infectious Disease Kris Ehresmann noted one indoor wedding southwest Minnesota guests allowed (275), event masks produced 56 cases nine counties. 100%, they've bought Trump/right-wing cult. would argue number depressed people hasn’t tripled (risen certainly tripled) rather many people masking depression distractions like bars, restaurants, activities finding without crutch must face reality depression. oppressive nature pandemic absolutely going cause people depression. think many already suffering work culture social issues existed already pandemic came around. elementary disease vector principles applies time everybody! I'm scared incoming winter, I'll best get ready going far depression rabbit hole. winter worst enemy. basically positivity rate ""better"" (or least reliable) measure spread disease actual case numbers is. 

For example, imagine area 10,000 tests per day discovers 1,000 cases per day positivity rate 10%. Let's say area decides cut testing 90% 7 days. 1,000 tests day discovers 100 cases, still 10% positivity. let's say 7 days that, decides go direction increase original testing ten fold 7 days. 100,000 tests day finds 10,000 cases. 

Imagine looking numbers time observer. Imagine looking case count. Originally case count 1,000 day, suddenly drops 100 day week. Looks like massive improvement. oh shit, 10,000 day next week, wtf happened? Must massive outbreak now. no, true spread virus community really change period time. changed much we're detecting testing. scenario, percent positivity metric much better indicator reality - spread actually changing much period time reality, percent positivity change much, reflected reality.

That's like low percent positivity - look one metric, that's good one indicate things going well. praying hard enough. Yet people say US rushing vaccine. Plague States Amerikey can’t two years now?  least hear laughing still barred travel anywhere besides Brazil. /s baby did. entire stance relevant threat. Check Jackson Heights nothing happen least January. believe maximum amount people permitted gatherings Maine 50, thumbed noses at. hope manslaughter charges. embarrassment. much people keep saying that, difficult imagine. know divorce rates spiking (as are, likely, breakups). social situations would lead casual hookups banned/ cancelled. Accidental pregnancies seem much less likely circumstances.

Seems like everyone experiencing reduced access many forms healthcare (telemedicine, delayed appointments, etc) allowed visitors advocates hospital, etc. I'm struggling imagine *worse* time consider deliberate pregnancy. Look president lol reason wear masks though. Hello. 

I took rapid test results back positive, quarantined RV took “regular” test following day, 2 days received negative result. 

Which one believe? really, really need return work since crew struggling. short handed is, reason tested contact guy positive. entire crew tested negative, mine rapid test since I’m management. 

What thoughts? theory CDC supposed present one message US public.

They muzzled Trump. Define struggling define low.

They're adding 400-600ish day.

Some provinces 1k active cases, others 2.

Indoor dining still banned quite lot places even though countries would've back case counts. government prudent. misrepresented replying question attempted political interference. Unlike sub, Gotlieb (like Fauci) probably see seasonality overwhelmingly likely.

We're sort ""getting away"" fatigue right now, compared what's coming respiratory illness season. ""...oh, yeah, places big deal. felt safe."" Florida 2/3rds transplants.  venture say anyone coming Florida summer high IQ begin with. hell... Massachusetts create vaccine tell anyone? rise soon. drove downtown city, one biggest country. Packed full tourists ages, maybe 1/4 wearing masks. It’s interesting much universities seem policing students campus. get policing campus activities seems kind gray line. Maine

Yep. 3 dead result wedding Maine. poorly worded.

Do mean number depression **diagnosis** tripled? COVID-Series-X Seems expected, right? world might literally end next three months lot people suddenly acutely aware fact. go peacefully fight. seemingly prioritize bars things trying reopen.

A lot seem think they're negotiating virus. suited lead situation all. Compile headlines outbreaks associated weddings. Highlight deaths close family members cases. Tell *that's* God's sign. Tbf, dying care. adult enough attend wedding pandemic. also adult enough face consequences.  You’re still here?  introvert weeb im best time rip mhc.... Wrecked That's delightfully dark. may borrow it. 275 arrests then. Murderers, them.. moved across country last August, holiday season moving in, little time actually experience new city make friends.

Which sucks impossible make friends since literally every social outlet closed form. become awkward ask people grab drink stigma right now. Shits real weird Huh, tragic spin ""three weddings funeral"". called ""herd immunity.""

No, isn't. Keep mouth shut spew dumb shit understand it. helps (Hurts well) lot Millenials Gen Z really planning getting pregnant lot reasons. Tell uninfected person whatever want immoral, it’s immoral violates NAP.

Boy, that’s wrong.

You’d correct someone knows infected actively trying infect others. clickbaity titles annoying I'm sorry Grandmother. family lives LA seen since last summer mom high risk want risk picking way see her. disgusting many people given much prevent spread people disregarding saftey others flippantly.  Idk title seemed pretty straightforward me

Edit - looks like direct quote Broward Sheriff’s office twitter account SK never anything near level community spread US still has. test trace place almost immediately, still many states unable get shit together. entire country locked then? Try Remind 2 weeks. distribute administer Moderna Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, given stringent cold storage requirements? require -9 -98 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s cold. typical freezer truck isn’t good enough. Likewise typical freezer warehouse isn’t cold enough easier. can’t use distribution infrastructure typical medical supply distribution.

It seems like pretty big problem, almost one talking it. Lol even look study referenced? control arm HCQ/azithro treatment arm + calcifediol. going outside. Try calculator, provide estimate relative risk based number cases area bunch factors (mask, outdoors, number people room, distance etc). clubs still open control. thought board SK plan? incompetent programmers! Bush failed miserably too.

Maybe stupid elect politicians think government always fails. Willful ignorance. reality continue see spread rate we’re seeing something higher we’re seeing now, end year upwards 20% population us could exposed coronavirus,” Gottlieb said, adding would reason start see slowdown result pandemic’s “natural Gottlieb: “I think tragic consequence there’s going lot death disease along way, think end year, we’re likely least acute phase epidemic part it’s going end infecting lot people then."" thought letting people go vacations like nothing ever happened good idea. not. made masks mandatory way late people care, sick feeling sick, well, hell everyone else.

People happy nothing done still everything alright, mask, taking anything seriously. still wear mask, one know actually gotten probably 100% effective anyway. putting everyone risk wearing mask? brother push back? Sounds like boss taking advantage him. handful districts fully in-person — I’d say maybe 10 districts. vast majority hybrid plan, quite communities starting fully remote.

The districts going fully in-person start either wealthy (Lincoln) beaten path (the outer Cape &amp; far Western Massachusetts). obviously fear mongering troll. He’s amazing. pope catholic? thing think either squirted stream directly onto candle flame flame moved stream exploded contents bottle her, bottle fell onto flame near watched melt plastic exploded. 🤷‍♀️ No, virus control. still stuck 40,000 cases per day. raised ones bottom something like Guaranteed Minimum Income? everyone least enough would inequality still issue? result implicit distrust authority experts, point Facebook meme truth scientific paper. can't rationalize distrust. read headlines like need think need lower population elderly obese... Oh wait. Yeah, I’m enjoying conversation least see you’re coming from. good.

I know can’t know full long term effects, guess I’m saying that’s way always predict long term effects former viruses we’ve dealt with. Even common cold, you’re vulnerable super unlucky, similar *crazy* long term effects (though markedly less common).

And yes, disagree role government. would agreed entire life year went tear excoriating news sides looked realized sheer depth misinformation.

If you’re camp waiting vaccine, disagree lot regarding science body evidence know; ultimately, goals close enough don’t see need argue. may even vaccine soon November!

Anyway, wrap up, stay healthy try stay good spirits. not, I’ll keep checking back! I'm telling you, yet ready re-enter real world. Go back bunker check us weeks. problem talking South Korea here. matter way things go people wanna say right are. ""South Korea wears masks"" See they're sensible! ""South Korea masks mandates"" See that's good thing they're things right! Like whatever say they're right we're wrong.

Probably 0 none professors too?

How explain better grades Greek system participants? Sure, NYC tax base shrinking daily.  even really see full impact next fiscal year.  COVID injure cities, permanently change New York. Boris mostly still spreading virus infected before. Nepotism higher grades non Greek students??? professors too?

Wow. better investment thought. Totally. individual also humanity. It’s really full selfish ignorance. think could make argument it’s within best interest everyone wear mask take precautions, even self interested people.  Wait, sub really lot misinformation?

Man people really stupid init. wonder get away much It’s broken system. 250 years completely destroyed everything hoped for, within last 40 years. 

I’d suggest relocated life somewhere else. American “dream” better fresh start country gives shot you. be. Personally feel shoulder blades. legitimately feels like I’m carrying monkey back. feels like got weight soul. usually takes couple days early bedtime go away till next time. must science. Agreed around. overhaul hvac ventilation system install expensive laboratory grade viral air filters, implement UV lamps Ok birthday boy bubbles also get bigger 🤣 Excuse wanting get back things enjoy also wanting spread virus killed ton people. FAR lethal flu know that. isnt lethal compared viruses killed family member reckless would finally change mind, that’s way. People demonstrations largely wearing masks staying outdoors. Sturgis way people almost zero masks packed less space drinking bars spitting contests. large gatherings created equal. Carolines have. Airports categorically less busy year ago, depending time day airports completely dead anymore. Airlines good job enforcing mask mandates, HEPA filters (which remove 99.97% virus particles) cycle air aircraft every 2-3 minutes. 

There also couple studies come indicating air travel safer expected, also pretty telling *any* major spread events linked flights. Right? expert opinions, it’s wonder diseases all! /s 2 months ended back march. Educated != intelligent really funny topic right now, I'm glad able joke it. sound like fucking horrid human being. ABCnews.go writes TRASH. Yes that’s serum institute Pune. already mass producing vaccine approved, reach people soon possible. didnt went wear mask social distance absolute numbnut. Noone asked stay inside forever, asked mitigate risks. exactly, even use hand sanitizer car, killed virus- maybe- still need wash off. Plain old soap kills it, breaks apart washes away. worried enough feel like need ask ventilation system. stay gym get back bunker. Yup. check OPs post history - it’s barrage nutritional pseudoscience. Wouldn’t surprised work bogus nutrition startup something. People automatically assume it’s vitamin profit motive, fact supplement industry enormous, thrive internal biases prefer “natural” remedies “nasty modern chemicals”.

Don’t get wrong - might useful, watching sub blow pilot study really exposing scientific illiteracy group felt superior shunning HCQ early 🤷‍♂️ pretend society fine ignore deadly disease worry economy more.
 Health isnt priority according them.  know asymptomatic people make big part actual infections, also people major deniers. Even people symptoms, many sick refuse admit get tested.. admit do? high cognitive dissonance group means real number probably lot higher. French word ""Karen""? testing ;) That’s dumb. worth read came 18mo ago I've never been, would gone one - FREE! insecure Yeah, r/COVID19 science based sub. fear based sub. deciding factor scarier scenario is. early vaccine made sound rushed, sub start pushing idea giving “super COVID” shit. Let's also forget large swathes Africa, ebola still recent memory, many far deadlier viruses covid. Many people much quicker heed public health advice recent disaster parts continent, part overcome incredibly well less cooperation citizens. might less resources bit stories coming Africa amazing regards steps taken reduce spread covid. 

Here western Europe really anything scale coronavirus worse, ebola, living memory many us (that threat us here, something see news.) people argue masks anti science conspiracies, much developing world gets need something done before. Ah, beware *Fallacy Fallacy Fallacy*:

Where discussion goes rails someone uses ""pointing Fallacy"" argument following retort derails conversation pointing flaws arguing fallacy, conversation fallacies we're sitting waving fallacies around Imagine thinking online school worth 90% person school lmaooo Teachers discouraged wearing masks may ""hamper education"" still believe really needed ICU, press get masses side?

Oh darling... course matters- title click bait. Within story writer obtusely contradicts logic: although can't prove wont get covid19 inanimate object can't prove either. Terrible illogical writing. 

Idiocy. wife got married park poor foreigner. everyone values situation you. Schools already reopened month, daily cases spike many states. Schools also perfect place get herd immunity due quite crowded kids won’t wear masks, Kids understand basic math won’t even scared covid it’s affecting less seasonal flu, that’s virus without vaccine vs flu seasonal shot, death rate still lower kids covid compared seasonal flu, cases severe hospitalizations kids covid highly likely go schools on. Seasonal flu even school bus tragic accidents bigger worry kids covid. Good.  Yes unbelievably dystopian Reading sub helping things.

Take break internet go outside. Can’t blame man lot sub thinks drag next year/that vaccines won’t work/distributing take forever/crowds sports never come back frankly kind hard read Im contact tracer TX wish people attitude get touch them. People react us like inconvenience them.

Like fuck sorry letting know may exposed get test. dont think many people listen isolation orders either. could spectrum human response pandemics — haven’t reports posted people back 1918 protested wearing masks? 

Denial. helpful. human. Trump ilk fuck anything up? That's hangup. I've seen people attempt use paper ""prove"" masks work study summary asserts asymptomatic transmission weak vector, read it, every asymptomatic carrier wearing hairdresser study, symptomatic stylist wore mask infect protect Sweden? Nah, think so. Health care providers going vaccinating everyone else. Makes sense vaccinate first. safety everyone else's. It’s ok, Covid death rate down, murder rate up. Evens end suppose. Nope leaches plastic cardboard. honestly state state dude. state controls handling data.

We'll see plays out. medicine disastrous effects would found testing. sure see similarities. argument makes sense. infectiousness issue, infctiousness *causes* end result. Everyone infectious, nobody dies result big deal.

A death death.

Lolololol omg actually cracking up. It’s healthy assimilate everyone around disagreements within families direct extended.

Thanks putting forth biggest joke argument prove convo competition proven inferiority. 

Also, side note it’s 2020 please get away assuming everyone bro. again, shows alllll need know you. Get woke pray Covid journey! 😂 0 deaths! Cause people would realize get vitamin sun, means going outside therefore killing Grandma Cashing checks Nah, wouldn’t need google, could go laptop save science primary literature read reference later.

I mean .. *can* save bookmarks. That's do. save Devonthink databases annotate them.

If save documents directly drive cant keep track retractions. many world Covid literature. dont really know data still good.

Just tip! automatically assume everything says lie proven otherwise... proven correct outlook far often not.

So, fuck vaccine. One issue. People behave like super-spreaders highest odds already covid19. bit late vaccinate point. Could gone mouth way - mouth, lungs perhaps.

\- **Mask**. simple mask, actually sealed face, could easily went edge gap mask. Mask actually sealed air tight face, still easily let contaminated air. Virus airborne, like dust - floats air, easily bypass gap mask.

\- **The eyes**. Virus infect eyes. virus like dust easily float AROUND face shield.

Therefore solve issues? Need actually seal airtight air breathe in, compromise. Seal eyes AIR TIGHT, ie swimming goggles least. Duct tape mask perhaps.

Now better solution masks / swimming goggles alone - perhaps fully sealed head cover, better yet, fully encapsulated air tight suit. make stuff garbage bags example make fully sealed head cover suit -- ie make garbage bag head cover cut hole see of, add clear plastic cover hole seal air tight, cut another hole place HEPA filter fabric so, also sealing airtight, air let filter. Head cover - make sure seal body, duct tape body somehow - ie neck so. Actually keep airborne virus, GAPS letting virus in. Lol. absolutely didn’t hahaha. It’s outside. isn’t hard understand. outdoors doesn’t contribute transmission meaningful way.  useless thing ""protection"" virus. kind generalization always makes angry. seems westerners talk Asians always leave Japan maybe Korea. Japan tonal language, rhythm emphasis much flat even western languages, obviously advantage even though ""of Asian descent"".

Seriously, can't say ""native speakers tonal languages"", rather forcefully racializing it...? great news, time open indoor dining NYC. don’t least give pilot run winter we’re big trouble. Particularly stimulus coming. dude stop killing grandma honestly looked Data, idea caps 20% that's true. think would lot lot higher though restrictions ever put place (even little they're followed right now). I.E. politicians bought. say enough cause massive problems. evolution snakehandlers That's quite accomplishment able high-altitude hike 4 months major respiratory viral infection. Sounds like making quite recovery.

I dont think could something like even Covid. Sweden, we’ve forced quarantine we’ve fine that.

Ah yes, massively worse deaths per million direct neighbours, sounds like guys fantastic *only die, it’s cool
**many could lengthy, costly crippling illness, also cool weird they’re still here? official end summer today; I’m honestly curious see tumbleweed-y tomorrow. 

I friends primarily live Manhattan living second home East Hampton since mid-March. planning stay mid-October least — apparently there’s tax benefit live 6 months one day outside NYC. I’m guessing people choosing remain children go school remotely forego option. 

(Also person lives Hamptons full time. It’s bananas sure, haven’t bothered know friends restaurant service industries thankful business they’ve able secure slow months hit.) Yeah bro family fucking hates lmao research proven super spreader events. That's cause outdoors, people wear masks effective protesting means spreading out. 

Sturgis know spread virus masks spreading out. Damn. really hope gets justice, definitely time report 24/7. think zero low numbers now? tourists none stones guy had. try stay themselves. think anyone half brain knows outdoor gatherings don’t contribute spread meaningful way.

While great low positive percentage, mean infection rate low. They're two completely separate metrics. troll account. empathy. Masks recommended beginning due lack data shortage masks. science, often new data comes changes conclusions. anyone travelled via plane inside US recently? airports busy? feel (relatively) safe, Yeah, even vaccine become politicized.

And fuck’s sake something mop. Mostly Right wing populists. Even people hate Justin Trudeau admit he's done good job Covid.

The politicians care human life looking pretty good right now. Turns can't PR way pandemic. weakening virus summer. virus doesnt spread well outdoors. summer, places like Texas, FL, etc. people go inside hot outside.

For example, MLB two teams superspreading events large chunk players contracted virus. virus spread opposing team either case, despite incidental contact players everyone outside (despite mask wearing widespread players field). 

Obviously perfect science, everything pointed way. Cooler weather, schools opening, etc. going big test Northeast whether spread stay down. Source?  People keep mentioning NY NJ awful death rates that's happens among first places nation dealing unprecedented health crisis, especially densely populated areas country.

I really dislike people use numbers push incorrect narratives. Numbers incredibly easy manipulate often mean nothing without context. Applying incorrectly guise ""hey, numbers lie"" awful approach data.  Even worse it’s wife’s family you’re afraid they’re going think you’re controlling. described reddit. question downvoted? French here, think situation bit different country people France politic 40 last years, quite 60% want big change (or revolution big reform). normal also antivaxx complotist there. France macron breaking point, people street every reason find. always good one country bit verge explode. second point can't made strongly enough. good leadership top probably could help alleviate horror. know country lacks it. Plus lot people country poorly acquainted critical thinking skills recognize played. think botched beginning made decisions make worse put NY warms way. think praised shit job numbers trending down. That's think stop yes questions. Police officers often can't socially distance. people like spit cough well. Cool info staff voming you? Lmao, face way throughout entire lecture. Besides, people heard behind anyway.

Seems like anti-solution issue want something whine about. Can't second wave never stops haha Absolutely nothing saying based backed studies could allow say 'everyone knows that....' depends. it’s rush job Trump administration, I’ll wait. Dr. Fauci says safe problem taking it.  safe one pic wearing mask, they're seated less meter other? 🤦 world? fairly average 8 cases someone done legwork find original positive samples gene sequence them, results sufficiently different prove reinfection. cases clinician simply assume false positive first case. Clinically also relevant treatment would never paid insurance. tests ever run researchers grant money pay sequencing tests, cases highly suspicious. results come back viruses similar can't publish can't prove kind long-lasting lingering infection. actual incidence reinfection worldwide could easily 1,000 times higher, growing time people recovered recovered people re-exposed. I'm kinda disappointed Tenet release sort streaming option. state movie theaters still shut down, closest one 45 minutes away another state. Plus really desire sit movie theater 2+ hrs right now. get recoup costs movies like mulan/other disney cartoons released theaters option rent/buy it. option rented Tenet online would liked that.

That's asked. Someone mentioned ventilation system reading seems like virus stay airborne hours, would good idea one. 


After reading, apparently Arnold left gym require masks exercise. gym require that. gym also say ""**recommending** everyone wear masks throughout lobby around others"" mean require them. 


So I'm asking bad idea go I'm date data says anything. Plus black another thing covid likes. understand CA added restrictions extended lockdowns kid sat front looks like every fibre trying stop slapping mop haired cunt. Oh, ever. Compared to? Sounds like try find something afraid of. agree eventually turn over. lot short term pain meantime. I'm talking owners, lose businesses, tens thousands people work restaurants transition jobs time jobs coming back online slowly comparison losing jobs, lose jobs. IMO spelling mistakes good indicator. Every phone internet browser red line misspelled words. simple tap red line fixes mistake, effort needed part. write one paragraph, make mistake miss it, see squiggle ignore it, that’s definition incompetence. (Which means lack skill, will, knowledge complete tasks successfully.)

Grammar mistakes get pass lack second safety net everyone has. Even computer won’t notice grammar mistakes, usually outright suggest incorrect words via autocorrect. use queue instead cue, safety net red squiggly line let know fix it. propaganda foreign governments? happening? Cancelling feasible waiting. wait till 2022 it’s year Winter Olympics you’re asking athletes wait 2 years supposed to, sports age quickly. It’s fair keep line waiting. either pull plug completely go ahead whatever restrictions can. Postponing continuously much limbo. visiting school anything slightly decrease it’s safety?

How could anyone reassured recently infected recovered person around. best he’s one person. worst discover still spread recovery. fuck point? Thanks link - curious turns - remember first time heard Chinese person say - workplace speaking counterpart China office. 

IMHO, going learn Chinese, better get heads class... herd immunity - people arent wearing masks outside. reason virus wasnt spreading FL sunbelt Spring, got hot everyone went indoors, spread like wildfire. science pretty clear outdoors significantly safer indoors. also scientists predicting second wave Northeast chased back inside again. It’s probably safe it’s long  really is... try fully mentally prepare worst case scenario. doubt happen. mean caused human malice. made worse human *sloppiness* sure, malice. like terrorists setting bomb intent kill terrorize. Trump accuses Chinese acting maliciously made things worse prevents co-operation. worst thing leader sort crisis pick fights. Religious people not. gullible, easily swayed care pretending good people. Add uneducated religious people get dangerous individuals. Plus former church found ones always claimed religious life outside church there. many reasons life outside church- closet pervs, mentally ill, narcissists personality disorders, users, toxic, abusers, kids wouldn’t talk couldn’t keep friends explanations. Live life. Ok, sure add “she’s clearly overweight” make sure cover talking points. joke Right choice! usually come good news, anyways.  Technically, indicates incompetence autocorrect program.  :) Cmon, know better that. 

People value health economy twats re-election chances. would really like follow stories shit like this, even Sturgis, saw couple stories 10-20 cases linked Sturgis 7 days, nothing. True, inestimably difficult track Sturgis past people attending, feel like proving super spreader events cause large spikes cases deaths (where attendees remain community) would go pretty far catching attention people grown lax. involved process informed enough guys seems think could issues. ""normal"" process 5-10 years, shorten funding, get 8 months? FDA pushed harder faster ever get done election politicized much been, interested guinea That's pretty significant, hopefully future studies show similar results. *worlds smallest violin plays* can't prove claims obvious logic thus call response propaganda, noted. 
Oh fyi media outlets shared opinion changed narrative regarding whether India army taken certain advantageous positions, yes 3 days, makes wonder credibility lmao. enjoy allllllll indoors outdoors. final time (and I’ve already asked enough times leave alone imply harassment end bc state three times left alone legally constitute harassment that). LEAVE ALONE. Stop commenting posts. Get life. Enjoy getting Covid byeeeee Felicia!!! It’s strong argument.  Take sensible measures, wear masks large groups necessary, avoid unnecessary gatherings, allow children go school build immunity among risk protect risk immunocomprised.   use sledgehammer smack square peg round hole. didn’t fix though No, misunderstood you. I’m secular humanist atheist. trying reddit quickly lunch. don’t think there’s need say confusion was. Good you. Seriously place depressing. actually walk door see reality see everyone else also pretty much moved literally end world like sub desperately wants believe. says says. Nothing else. sane person saying anything else. tilting windmills here. airplane could fall onto house evening. Live life can.  Mine gonna June 2021 thinking delaying June 2022...;-;!! tired waiting tied knot two Vegas families friends joined us live online world. city took amazing pictures without crowds background. zoomed families hotel romantic dinner after. whole laptop screen filled people lol. loved every minute it. similar Mexico,not extreme US still, think one biggest issues border US never closed Test trace quarantine?

But requires government action go neighbouring Pacific Asian countries. New Zealand working Australia vaccine access. 9 million people PNG also vaccinated. Flu season last year especially bad. Yeah agree here. there’s silent majority young generation sees things way well. whole country used dream. used conquer new challenges. used achieve scientific breakthroughs disaster forced hands. seems actual intelligence looked upon thing matters “feel” “stuff” “junk”. worst part? me, it’s super obvious see right it. lot adults around me? It’s almost impossible explain without coming across lunatic. Apparently entire generations people living rocks willingly enjoying it. Totally reasonable. Taxes, bars bring lot taxes. amazing. mean, feel like inevitable strategy...and point ideal (since it’s pretty much become endemic). Tighten restrictions, cases go down, loosen restrictions, cases go up, rinse repeat. Reward people following restrictions loosening them, punish tightening them. medical field...? like, 5,800 dead population 10M. sure. “Half population”... 🙄 Says obvious Republican.. irony Well... that’s know do. plenty good us. Just... enough outweigh bad. health insurance vaccine $0 co-pay covered preventative services. without health insurance expect subsidized vaccines cost anything patient. happens Flu vaccine. 

This vaccine make money, likely eat profits. value pharmaceutical companies develop vaccines. Wow, thanks adding details here. Yeah, really even know people could that....................I'm speechless appropriate non-derogatory adjective, I'll stop there. Lol. You’re spot on. told us prior haven’t gone places find days later X, Y, Z validated reason gone. Hmmm. Instead letting ruin wedding experience stress dealing them, get married somewhere else, like park something. 

Do something cheap safe socially distanced everyone enjoy much pandemic.

As venue, say good bye money. small price pay starting married life well. Consider something like bought house together suddenly house developed termites. 

Now nobody wants buy termite house you. sit termite house 20 years miserable purchase? No, eat bad investment start again. start again. wedding small safe free make it. Lol, get fucked. I’d happily charge No, Mexico third world country, heck term outdated  be. some, clock doesn’t 40+ years left.. people willing take risk spend time family Christmas. Maybe aren’t close enough family understand invasive species knows invade destroy Roll tide real question - compensated relative public school teacher municipality?

Here NYC - private schools expensive, teachers usually credentialed poorly compensated. result, private school teachers nowhere near good. sent kids public school exact reason - even factoring NYC corruption, spending lot money educating children private school would. interact someone shop public transport choice. person 200 party wedding mask monumentally immoral behaviour part Easy, won't. Phoenix basically beat it, Manaus style ITESM? expect we'll get vaccine, recognize future *massive* gamble. SARS-CoV-2 happened easy vaccinate (assuming promising early trials turn good efficacy data) happened vaccines works serendipitous developments led fast timeline. However, next pandemic may like this. average vaccine takes 4-15 years develop. need better strategies dealing halting society. damaging go years. keep hearing things like they're justified ""We get back lives point."" Like said, unsalvageable. gonna see burns... Useless bumbling oof. people who've tens millions get vaccine year, R value gonna plummet US. Maybe countries though. Geez people get uppity here. correct wrong; simply surprised understanding considered unethical administer placebo kind medication. simply misunderstanding. Basically honestly people need hear. People need hear ""Eh, probably fine"" A. SOMEONE 2% dies young B. death long term effects... giving people ask it. make sad. hopelessly single *before* COVID hit. I'm hopelessly even possible. trying doing.

Lol, entire argument semantic garbage? Ya, that’s happens everything held together band-aid. Then, global pandemic occurred. I’m 26 last time signs clinical depression 19. I’m definitely part group tripled. Ah. kinda grouped gig/part-time job economy rare exotic ones. One see mentioned lot 3rd degree burns healing. wrong Well least say Merry Christmas /s Sure, animal-to-human transmission happen, surely highest chance happen China highest population population density.

With said, virus jumped animal humans political issue, facts viruses popping different countries years, best us humans cooperate beat them, instead needless finger-pointing. OAN. They're conservative news source, way conservative Fox News. share stories cater uber conservative, even valid. recent ""6% deaths actually Covid rest underlying conditions"" lie. want believe true push narrative viewers want hear, justifies responsible empathy compassion neighbors. Anything justify belief masks dumb, social distancing necessary, ""just flu"", Bill Gates going inject us microchips, need get back lives way were, they'll try pass valid story.  People believe lies often like spread stories Facebook reason.  6% lie, looks like they're this.  that's seeing Facebook much. enough media picks story proves false twisting facts, they'll come another lie make rounds Facebook. Maybe things normal? Weird ain't it? Rising less populated states, more. Hence overall going overall. go back 4chan fucking hack No, working informal economy means get paid table, ie people US receive income cash don’t pay taxes Canada still struggling virus? thought numbers country extremely low. Sweden failed battle coronavirus everyone knows that. rescheduled said “fuck it”. Saved $10k used buy house. Zero regrets decline invitation get passive aggressive ""Its ok, know afraid things.""

Ugh get much. hate it. like way reply think same. Like anyone gets tested, even get tested, going admit probably contracted rally. ""Hmmm, left state recently. sure could gotten from."" think spring would look like breakup literally day valentines day, shit got bad quick. feel like I'm finally starting recover. long road, something changing. would expect basically every patient severe, lower respiratory case, hospitalized. That's pneumonia. expect full lung function several months get *any* infection takes lower respiratory tract. Maybe IQ Florida increase.

But judging sample defectors, turn Florida blue.  Things bring happiness I'm feeling down: baking bread, edibles waiting mail man every day see absentee ballot arrived yet fill hand deliver elections office day. US, Vancouver, BC *High-rise apartment complexes entered chat*

Also, good article covers know regard! It’s New Orleans steakhouse. shrunk menu trim unnecessary food costs items weren’t popular focused fast ticket times classic local foods signed couple delivery service. last night $11,000 sales 4 cooks slinging burgers, po boys steaks night haha. worked hard changes also fortunate customers! Obviously industry whole bad shape safety/menu changes keep new normal still possible survive/thrive. sub overrun COVID deniers, lockdown skeptics, anti-maskers. fuck happened here? Sweden fucked also pay 24hr covid tests staff comes you! Make everyone safe...I twice one week work film set still wore masks everyone fine. employees families willingly taking vaccine accord, yes does. China taking COVID-19 outbreak seriously, point literally top make sure outbreaks spread further. Well, Barney said I’m special guess would me. Trump needs take literal piss vaccine set fire it, would confirm really works. large chunk 60% take wont take people think election ploy Trump (Cause good bad news spun make look good) reason. guarantee lesson escapes them. Young people partying. point older people get infected fall.  We’re flying seat pants here. Thank goodness SARS research work done veterinary coronaviruses weren’t trying figure start. knew wanted attack Spike, needed stabilize it. Hope best prepare worst. That’s best do. Fair! hope that's case. Give break sister. Everyone? Hardly.

Just party people 'personal responsibility'. Marriage fucked begin with. don’t card don’t believe it’s real? guess think worlds first global hoax.  wish gatherings voice reason like you.

My town currently worst infection rates country (after making August almost cases) large maskless funerals attendees coming infected areas. 

Why least one people said, ""Hey, maybe celebrate guy's life killing bunch people.""

Worst part is, one attendees almost certainly going next congressman 🙄  One, barely sniffle..but positive.
My friend 104 temp 6 days, bad body aches I'm really sceptical, average time develop vaccine 7-10 years. Even maximum speed almost unlimited resources, lot potential vaccines (like 95%) drop clinical stages safe, activate immune system intended way create immunity reasonable time.

It's like we'll vaccines dozen manufacturers available soon, maybe one, worldwide. ineffective vaccine could even make things worse, lot worse. 

I'd happy works best case scenario, even 2021 optimistic safe, effective widely available vaccine. Well, that's scary. 56% hospitalized patients still visible lung damage 3 months. Well large group indoors together tore dinner Rochester attacked customers. call protest, assault vandalism probably viewing party basically thing. whole post, actually. paid covid19 China's fault. people know taking lockdown extremely seriously refused socially distanced visits recently. sucked. even gay Take half prescribed anti-biotic mean need take twice long, means still infection run out.  Congratulations, delayed honeymoon trip something pandemic over. said Australia, actually. Yet hear anything it. Yeah it’s mess. hope come senses beat virus None things listed contagious infectious diseases. Covid, however, one. Looks like cancelled. Earlier year said unlikely go ahead. height lockdown.

Maybe news timelines vaccines made confident could happen.

The issue decisions taken sooner rather later due logistics involved. bleak winter may still cancel, especially vaccines fail national program? Analyzing sewage cities towns isolating actual transmission rate predicting hot zones happen.

Oh yeah, forgot...it’s easier tell people stay home Labor Day. Philippines using police military monitor social media violations. again, it’s martial law without declaration. Yes, prabably get life long symptoms ""recovery"". want them?? Even tried, people literally protested open states. People fucking crazy. Europe problem officially party now. talk persistent symptoms recovery. see stats like infected, deaths recovered. huge amount recovered rest life lasting symptoms. would like stats, even recovered ones. wear mask, made paper cloth. It’s hard depressed you’re trying everything right, still go work deal people don’t care others, continuously worry catching virus said people potentially kill loved ones yourself. went Catholic elementary school. stereotype, high expectations students, more, real neurotic nuns would beat us yardsticks occasion. Rarely, though. would say education quite good, bit religious indoctrination. attend mass confess sins; bit psychological guilt play didn't. found uncomfortable tell older men touching looking indecent pictures confessing kids felt strange, too. take confirmation sacrament graduate that. Today sexual harassment definition, know Catholic sin children must confess will.

I depressed year finishing school alright afterwards. others well, others better. probably school prepared people better academically develop emotional competencies. I'd say forms 1-4 attended school environment generally emotionally unavailable me. Pupils forced stiff upper lip culture school. Many adults thought precocious, admirable 90s experience. dangers letting child ""just be"" forcing adulthood talked then. still problems ""just being"", I've worked therapists.

It's definitely mixed bag point view. academic performance stellar though, way ahead kids start middle school. Although honestly instruction much focused rote memorization advantage last. developed psychological disinclination Christianity learning ""normal"" public school like, last either. sick get? disingenuous way lookin it. cases protests. However people wearing masks outside spread pretty low. awesome! This’ll make stories tell easier come ;) Ugh. got sick husband asymptomatic except loss taste smell, decided get tested benefit public health statistics whatnot (disclaimer: US country heavily affected COVID). Come find later that, even though working home, insurance company forced take 10 days leave. insurance company decided classify COVID related claims work-related?! he's make lot calls get claim filed proper category get properly compensated time - actually take continued answer emails take phone calls. would easier get tested. Social Distance visits. visited backyards, bbqs everyone stayed outside kept 6ft apart. People yard, we'd meet car visit LOL. Fair, enough! playing sides wager. Let clear, covid wins battle. see changes sister ob-gyn said never seen large drop pregnancies. people fooling around like usual, especially single people single sex since January, fear transmission. never know someone goes. already cancelled next year? Thought they’d ready June? got friends party get covid literally like..""I understand got sick""..

🙄🤔🧐🤯 Dude that’s did. Paid like 50 bucks wedding license, sister witness. Went Buffalo Wild Wings reception LOL.. used money payment house. Calling party adheres contract “shitty” without read contract signed &amp; agreed parties irresponsible best ignorant worst. depends 100% wording contract. specify deposit non-refundable regardless circumstances. specify exceptions many not. instances seen money reserve date others see administrative fee...in almost circumstances labeled non-refundable. often case vendors clients try get contract dubious reasons (&amp; want deposit back). I’ve seen brides try cancel wedding due “life-threatening illness” find rescheduled wedding pregnant.

Remember...every clause contract probably exists previously someone something violated spirit agreement wasn’t explicitly prohibited.

If vendor offers return non-refundable deposit contractually required return it’s probably (financially). insolvent due pandemic doesn’t make “shitty”. YMMV watching college town near trying find numbers good. stories colleges closing issues (My son suppose go college online now). Cedar City Utah 33k population college SUU 11.300 students campus person. Public schools also open person 8k students staff. Since March 630 cases county, 0 people needing hospital, 0 deaths. currently 40 active cases county. K-12 college open normally (just masks extra cleaning ) since Aug 13? almost month. tried figure small college town successful far others not? Overall population young, would true college towns? elevation high, read studies suggest higher elevations get less severe cases? Overall better health start with? landlocked? (but landlocked means travel big cities make many purchases , amazon deliver one day post office, need car part , drive big city wait).

I would like know areas different. MA, stuck Utah (my mom retired here, low taxes, nice weather, cheap houses). still can't believe difference Utah CT. Almost population number cases CT death rate 10 times higher. Utah much lower access healthcare. Plus winder cancer, death certificates careful correct, federal state. also think anything hidden Utah, never place everyone knows everyone business. rented house close mom neighbors came meet app already info, including phone number listed another name used medical emergencies given hospital. don’t know you’ve thought option, people weren’t able come, streamed ceremony live Zoom went pretty well. know good number family members even work colleagues weren’t invited begin tuned Zoom stream watch everything. 

We made decision still big event original venue next year rather small wedding close cost, difficult decision make. “real” wedding done though, kinda wish would canceled venue ate deposit. I’m satisfied smaller day. live MN. surprised all, people outside cities taking seriously since beginning. However people wedding fined mask mandate.

Unfortunately numbers probably going continue rising this, Sturgis, Labor Day, schools open weather starts getting colder, forcing people inside. That's bad idea. Maybe look that. I'd need learn speak French. I'm tired lame leadership government agencies massively disorganized untruthful. third world country, Senegal would improvement. Yeah good. let people make feel bad. COVID life death. want take seriously, that's them. fucking dare put kids risk dumbass. see going site UGLY! every human America suddenly developed cancer, cancer would still ailment required treatment ""normal."" would ""normal"" people get cancer, cancer would still aberrant disease belong.

If everyone fat, fat ""normal"" sense people condition... never disease, aberration, healthy normal human body. Sure, zero epidemiologists sort repute saying state US met correct metrics open bars.

Even propagandist chief's CDC produced guidelines met. complicated that. sent nursing home residents virus back nursing homes rather keeping hospital. result massive outbreaks amongst vulnerable part population. New York thing.

We also high rates vitamin deficiency due shitty weather. Would nice could id people. studies like tend make people less cautious boom, 50k cases colleges. anywhere near impossible current technology. Everyone cell phone, could contract traced simple app tracks via GPS. tech would come together like pharma vaccine Numbers would way down. Oh yeah, Americans hate big brother case it’s costing peoples lives. 2 cousins... ‘But strong hook cross make that...’ I'm guilty that. Gotta better. Wow. wow. Get married. reception later. Walgreens, CVS (some Target), Shoprite flu shots available now. pocket cost without insurance $40-$41. insurance, typically free. Please get flu shot. sorry possibly dumbest question ever masks good preventing others getting covid and/or preventing getting using standard masks like wondering I'm making problem worse getting first set masks numbers (roughly) line total, Pentagon reported nearly 38,500 COVID-19 cases among military personnel. 8,500 cases among DoD civilians, 5,100 cases among dependents, 3,600 cases among contractors.

That's 55,700 cases worldometers says seventh U.S. service member died due COVID-19, according latest Pentagon also 50 civilian deaths, seven dependent deaths 20 contractor deaths due COVID-19, according Pentagon records.

That's 84 deaths worldometers says 88. Lol assumptions I’ve gotten comment hilarious. subject showed social distancing net increased following BLM protests, likely increased stay-at-home compliance non-protestors. 

But making opposite point claim. Staying home decreases transmission. fact people staying home counter balances increased transmission protests mean increased transmission protests still occur. people staying home decreasing transmission attributing decrease protests fact precisely opposite true. India's projected deathtoll [COVID-19 case anyone wants compare models

note: one goes Nov 1, unlike IHME, hopefully they'll come Dec/Jan date soon! donate brain science clearly dont need it. Boy oh boy, irony coming you. happens put added sugar everything large food producers use food science produce hyper-pallatable foods intention making addictive possible. Suggesting I'm fault...is absolutely ludicrous.

You knew risks &lt;100% compliance *chose* accept them, not?

You certainly bear fault putting harm's That's exactly what's wrong US days. one gives fuck anyone else knows, care, actions affect others.

Wtf talking ""these days""?? 

**And also entire population never demanded stop acting like social creatures overlords say Every infection traced back line (which could literally thousands) exactly 100% fault.

I'd never fault someone unknowingly transmitting airborne disease. Pressuring health officials interfering. Thank kind words. hint something wrong bound trigger worry. much do, getting sick would slow down. 

I work Amazon, think may new health insurance plan company take advantage of. look government job, since trying get away Amazon worker general. treated...well, nevermind.

Thank much. Idk. risk get vaccinated that’s probably good enough people.  this? EssEnTiAl TrAvEl Nobody's telling work. happened work tourism something got shut down... well, sorry hear that. fine though. 

It's perspective - clearer person think they'll harmed hope sake that's true. also feel way, except experience risk long term effects much me. happen work home though, wife dogs big house, sweat me. alone apartment job taken me, I'd feel differently. think I'd realize temporary. Death (or permanent damage) farthest thing temporary! go US route, they’ll ignore COVID science, say YOLO.  masses. really important healthcare workers teachers get vaccines first. grocery store workers, on. 

There 3 vaccines approved early release limited use. vaccinations starting happen now, small scale. production takes time money. I'm really hoping see vaccines administered New Year. student anywhere Wuhan, could maybe see ""let's bash Asian"" point. student literally Wuhan, starting point epidemic. joke ""Let get mask."" 

Was teacher line? Yes. student deserve apology? Yes. think firing way top. allow people little bit room make mistakes grow them. one likes happened year.

It's fair - brides, non-essential workers, essential workers, landlords, tenants... sucks everyone unique way.

She needs get herself. Attended back yard wedding last night 100 people. apart 10% wearing mask social distancing. Biden need worry election coming up. scientists doing, especially we’re already going vaccines pretty soon. even then, it'll struggle. understanding restaurants survive putting people seats 100% capacity possible. Take help revenue 40% capacity. LOL gotta love white ppl man. True race ppl brainwashed successful. must proud fucking stupid are. Opinion polls easily swayed selecting opinions take Than* know causes heightened mortality rates. you’re grown adult, know risk factor. think you’re liable getting sick and/or dying, continue isolate yourself. Let rest us live normal lives. 

We’ve flattened curve, lost millions jobs, thousands businesses. vaccine guaranteed. you’re scared think there’s chance you’ll get sick, stay home. simple anything else power grab. Covid certainly large part there's much else going world time. negative news overwhelming normal support system. wants vaccine end year? Okay interfering though. elderly spend quite bit. get COVID also disproportionately drain resources. immunizing elderly would immediate affect eliminating drain medical resources.

Given much working population actually still working, premise safe following current guidelines arguable. Current precautions may enjoyable, work followed. several states infection rate low, falling. clearly many/most industries able work safely issue.


93 percent 65 live community, nursing homes assisted living. community small percent homebound mean isolated, people come them. seem like gain much leaving last. 

I think easy solution this, especially vaccine mandatory. One thing consider risk conditions probably less likely resist getting vaccinated. may actually able cover populations quickly since frequent interactions medical community. need want save wipes. Pool mix water dish soap kitchen sink clean things get wet. Anything that’s snacks/non cold stuff put aside day going use right away. Yeeaaahhhh unexpected. like virus care that's party friends trust, needed break. shocking aren’t happy point don’t acknowledge thoughts feelings. I’m glad I’m keeping family safe. You’re right, it’s water duck’s back. article actually say anything except ""wants"" scientists hurry up. 

No money, laundering, deals, interference. he's annoying checking much. conspiracy needs dropped. harmful. Hard give one cared begin with. Others get sick, there. may die. know care lol save it, I'm posting others. sound informed.

The large rise cases happened states protests occur large numbers. huge protests saw happened states large rise cases, obviously protests contribute.

The protests show large outdoor gatherings everyone also wears mask risky indoor gatherings. 

You sound like trouble parsing information realizing one golden rule every situation. also sound like fan social justice, least bothers areas important majority also performing better areas not. 

Anyway, sorry world conform want. first Oxford, guessing people know one two. Interested phase 3 volunteer? Zoom wedding baby! Mines two weeks. Almost 10k daily deaths even universal masks. 20k mandates easing. predictions probably gotten somehow worse data come in. Schools entire summer prepare, problem one government official consulted and/or relayed advice HVAC experts. didn’t want hear it, advise don’t open schools, open it’s going cost bit least minimize airborne vector greatest extent possible. 

As HVAC specialist, would advise schools delay person openings local weather least comfortable enough economize (use outside air cool spaces instead recirculating room air, requires retrofits cases); open every outside air damper fullest, even means degradation performance; upgrade filters MERV 13, add many filtered circulating fans every space get hands on. application specific things manipulate, idea dilute filter much possible. 

I’d also suggest reducing circulation students possible. Teachers moving students staying class would best probably practical, could create bell schedule specific grade say lower class moves quarter past hour, middle class moves half past, next class moves quarter til, upper hour. ventilating shit common spaces. Sorry band, choir, athletics.

Winter months worse: people driven inside; people choose fogged glasses masks; breathing lead freezing face. maybe get lucky find virus gets deactivated 2-5 seconds 100 degree heat get furnace. spare economy either. They're basically boat rest Scandinavia. Zero gains huge costs health lives.  wedding right obviously pretty stupid. said, numbers presented noise, signal. average number confirmed infections due wedding size? Y’all need friends, major life events unimportant? important you? actually think matters? Yeah real. Stand yourself. Guess we’ll agree disagree credibility Chinese press. use arguing it. Here's latest case/death charts Indiana, running 7-day state currently 50.21 deaths per 100k population. That's US per capita deaths 56.76. Vaccines aren’t thing, seem like they’ll come anyways. could also better treatments, better masks things like that, better TESTING, get equivalent at-home pregnancy tests squash thing pretty efficiently. 

We’re working detecting outbreaks sewage, dogs trained detect it. breathalyzers developed. knows might get us mess. mean, totally business whatever opinions like, weird see someone take opposite position entire global consensus, also complete arrogance. Like idiots idiot things would listen anyway really need vaccine grandpa. actually pretty likely. friend's wedding yesterday 200 people zero masks. Zero fucks given people thing called freedom make decisions. Also, Wisconsin I'd willing bet hangovers worse Rona. like deciding one worse: someone planned murder another person someone decided shoot random people. Lol, fair point! I'll pass even *being* outside Florida unless I'm swimming shocking all, went church kid friends tied knot ASAP could sex. divorced within 5 years sex make marriage last. majority America don’t give shit. dot dumb know it’s fucking virus, live everyday. started 2 weeks flat curve 6 months later, it’s abuse power point. cope unlike protestors nobody wedding wearing masks. said breach contract blue face didn’t care, people aren’t getting contract. Read statistics. Zero masks. Meaning masks likely mandatory. Fifty six affected guests represented 9 COUNTIES across Minnesota. cases multiply idiots attended wedding. Lol sorry get married stay locked stop using internet mean protest people wearing MASKS? attest this. Social isolation sucks, doubly almost ""closest"" friends live one place together. mean prior quarantine i'd hang lot frequently - every weekend least once. opposite case since quarantine/lockdown. lot FOMO, lot uncertainty. Working home still net positive solely due fact commute wake 5 minutes first meeting 8:45, days lose meaning every day sitting front computer. Every day pretty much same. Honestly days question point is. Loneliness, anxiety, probably undiagnosed depression well. Never felt before.

I say extroverted particular before, introverted sense kept circle small close. I'd hang every weekend least. done seeming end sight, lack certainty really gotten past month so.

I miss social contact, socialization. get vigilant careful, lack end sight gotten me. sometimes feel forgotten man way living away effectively alone sort friends (both ones mentioned previously friends) FOMO affecting damaging mental health. can't quite articulate thoughts well mind. Exactly. people getting offended student's behalf professor making joke overreaction Wuhan. Plenty actual smart people still care it. Stop making lies justify caring. People think they're good forever truth reinfections happening want believe ever said men ones it? title article certainly not.

What women abused women? Im suggesting freaks come night. 
 
Thats pretty much it. dont argument one way social distancing alread know vaccine comes itll like Christmas morning people start losing mask getting others faces again, usual. I’ve harvesting fuck it, definitely helps limitations. trying refer adaptive immune system simple terms.

I've read studies showing circumstances subset patients, certain proportion pre-existing memory B cells may killed measles virus, affect memory B cells yet exist such, adaptive immune system still able generate measles-specific response infection. trying avoid someone making particular nitpick explain (although clear, poorly, I'm still explaining poor wording now.)

(And rate, studies also showed memory B cells could easily regenerated upon second exposure immune damage, accordingly, mostly reversible pretty reasonable timeframe.)

Sorry confusion. three years get email haveibeenpwned saying email address password leaked. there, done that. sign media accounts anymore.  mean florida dropped 4th 5th. much celebrate there. course “about” less 1,000 deaths decreasing. whatever, let’s rely statistics. love shooting weddings, didn’t love 7 last month. Everything March-July pushed next year, September work, August busy nobody wore masks. Fortunately next month quarantine prepare October gigs. Yeah. number one effect vaccine improve chances don’t severe case get post vaccination. Severe death. I'll try explain emotions reading title.

I, man, feel attacked this. feel accused. feel guilty. feel ashamed. That's feel think lot men feel way.

It's easy reconcile feelings, ask sympathy. 

As boy experienced abuse home. much makes angry domestic violence. still triggers sends chills spine.

It's painful accused something hate much.

First foremost one simple message: Men hit women children. barely news. see single channel reporting overtaken Brazil. There's absolutely concern now. specific law broke claim prosecuted climate change deniers Pretty sure people going hospital pneumonia would obvious downvoted. I'm way get yearly SARS 1 vaccine right now. lost job went straight Medicaid office guess every state option. Shhhh dont like facts interrupting narrative.  Hey guys, parts body might recover one day!! bad news is, you’ll dead. don’t worry that’s organ donor program for, you’ll go hero! well... Acts president enact would make companies produce items things like pandemics wars...

But President never enacted Acts Maybe OP worth hassle way breaking them. maybe future complications. barely year since discovered virus. knows long term complications secondary activation? shouting protests? Colorado’s getting snow tomorrow...after 95 degrees today. Maybe 8-10” put fires Create foundation. Give $5B foundation. Hire self CEO foundation paying $1M per year. goes without saying haha Could swear article equally applies domestic audience CNN. Stand corrected, thanks Good, done sooner. knew back February! Karène  francophone block seem struggling lately. True key. sweden good scheme nordics (when comparing covid-deaths) whole lot people need die. sane person wants that. hope neighbours continuous avoid situation Sweden spring. compare best less prosperous? (Noting pretty much world less prosperous, measured gdp.) WANT Covid least problems I'll take trade. Currently I'm paranoid ( love smells, food, ability walk relatively long distances). should’ve led studies. can’t say “herd immunity” sub without providing context support get massive amounts knee jerk downvotes. 2 dobermans they're reason still physically active. also 2 cats 1 small dog, kept them. miss daily trying best reach out. really need stop talking butt. hospital been, still is, allowing us bring masks home enough available suppliers. Masks scarce four months ago, still relatively hard come by. Non-clinical staff encouraged bring masks long meet approved guidelines. Edit: Clinical staff also allowed bring masks NIOSH certified. husband married 17 years ago 32 people wedding including I. bridal parties invite anyone age 18. Weddings people getting married people see people regular basis. guests might nice have, absolutely necessary. still people tell us wedding favorite wedding ever attended. relate, live Michigan positivity rate stayed 3-4%, reopened schools already seeing cases. don’t give us month go back phase three goes deeper that.

Even technology tools schools use challenge.

Do schools computers? Sure. many computers ability record, broadcast, edit, decode HD video real time? many ability SD video?

What's bandwidth connections? reliable they?

What software available? that, much used software company lobbied adopted state law? platforms integrate useful ones?

If teacher 200 day contract, much 10 days start teaching kids start going spend training teachers MUST lesson planning mandatory safety training and...

Who's paying that? Germany 1 definitely atleast within top 5 nearly one dies covid anymore, look numbers. like almost gone life almost back normal here. cost skyrocketing? federal student loans can't discharged Catholic high school too? depends length immunity know given time immunity good go. Since people reinfected second time, way unknowns knowns Thanks SAY asked. there's one available friends/family facing immunity they'll change tune.  It’s socializing getting shitfaced Applebee’s like everyone loves say. able see loves ones extended period time unnatural unrealistic expect. based 8 months evidence, happens 6 months now? know people reinfected second time, pisspoor immunity mutation? time answer. said sort of. matters people actually do, government legislates. yes, testimonial evidence one lower end reliability. back March; hospitals able keep enough regular N95s non-surgical settings. biggest shortage right surgical N95s, something person purchase. agree, I'd also argue we're primarily scanning moderate severe course, especially research publications; know we'd getting CT mild courses COVID-19 regularly clinical practice unless rule something else like PE whatever. least institution, unless there's another indication, we're really getting CT scans COVID-19 patients -- X-ray primarily used. (I'm dumbass med student that's blanking stupidly can't think reasons besides PE get CT scan, please correct know better.)

Second, even paper, there's disconnect prevalence CT abnormality clinically significant dysfunction. lazy hate research. movie, Magic Pill, great segment cases mild/moderate autism benefited ketogenic diet article boring.    developed PTSD last october depression decade. February starting get life back - friends, productivity, hope future, senior year college - covid got bad enough area college shut mostly everyone (i exception) ended spending first three months quarantine completely alone. mental health finally getting better worst ever lost tiny support system building. 

So basically, feel dude. really wife tested positive Tuesday. smell, taste, SOB, fever on. would say always close contact live smaller home still share bed. would usually take Vit winter Covid 19 started spreading kept taking it. today, symptoms feel great. wife honestly looks good today yesterday rough shape. purpose argue social distancing get vaccine, hate break dont think going happen.

My argument vaccine see wind social distancing measures. Sure things like hand sanitiser everywhere likely persist. Maybe even better approach sick leave, staying 6 feet go window vaccine rolls out. 

Are suggesting keep social distancing even successful vaccination programme? estimates rising 31 states. hate bearer obvious news, **is** catastrophic situation. would depend r number cut 50%. think.. yes things would find trending consistently better. Return king absolutely data mutations. mutations we've seen enough create new strain, despite genetic monitoring outbreak since November.

I said ""mutate enough yearly strains"". means mutation rate high create new strains year. Thus far, almost year monitoring, yet see evidence case Covid something like flu. Sarcasm? Lmao country morons RNA vaccine. It’s used people ton livestock. real concern isn’t much adverse reactions, whether actually last long body. would exclude yourself! mythical NIOSH N95s buying? find KN95 online none stores Baltimore all. Looking case count deaths covid load nonsense. people barely affected people die die causes. sad thing get 🧐 university suspended faculty evaluations duration pandemic. done benefit adjuncts, lecturers tenure-track folks yet tenure. also throw least US, Big Pharma zero liability anything goes wrong, safe shield law?

Infection rate complete coin flip here. One day like 500 next 1000 Ahh, classic blocking case. Never gets old. Funny assuming stuff. depends purpose coming sub. Typically freaks come night, mean ones like troll, bullshit, word. 

If purpose argue social distancing get vaccine, hate break dont think going happen. anyone know many Total Hospitalizations year Covid? can't find number. Florida ain’t one them! Suckers! No, people sub like, ""YES, please, *anything* beneficial toward effort *trying save lives*, thanks!"" rest seem scream, ""How dare ask care others? anyone think corporations economy? freedumbs?"" stupid shit like insulting others caring whether people live die unnecessarily. Surgical Grade N95s relevant necessary must maintain strict sterile environment due performing surgical procedure. happening, cannot trust hospital staff provide PPE setting source/suppliers sell hospitals first place; point, staff member likely bought second hand counterfeit. 

Regular N95s available purchase marked prices, however proper hospital environments (some vents construction work), effective properly fitted create proper seal. cannot willy nilly allow people whatever want, especially hospital staff members deal aerosol forms virus.

It absolute bullshit hospitals keeping need N95 masks, however cannot say 'bring own' legal liability reasons, along fact one staff member something properly could result massive outbreak. I've severe depression decade - worst ever been. never felt hopeless - especially rest mental health bad planned check kind mental health facility graduated May. So, that's fun. things gotten worse.

For vaccines, probability success ranges 7% non-industry-sponsored candidates 40% industry-sponsored candidates.

People still weddings? Crazy Wow, can't imagine would want go wedding badly enough quarantine 2 weeks. Parents bride, maybe see. Zero *known* cases. Helps inhibit undetected cases flaring causing large outbreak otherwise would reasoning. Ugh. fabulous get absolutely true. see feel it. like, taking surveys?.. Feel like one ever known ever part ""study shows..."" type survey. doubt people questioned survey.. one tested 5,000 people 1,000 people after.. expect study able focus individuals that.. 5k covid 1k really good indicator entirety country? run selfishness, narcissistic nature American society. America built controlled narcissistic behavior. greedy piece shit celebrated. Take Musk, he's giant piece shit treats everyone like crap insufferable fuck whose family got riches apartheid oppression. Yet, people love him. walking narcissistic ass wipe zero empathy never gives credit recognition anyone else.

Anecdotal interesting trend Ive noticed well. appears significant overlap anti-mask crowd racists fucking Black, guarantee guy would never come tell us put mask on,"" huffed Gothamist also could build bullet trains country never would. sorta irrelevant. banana republic lot stuff Also turns people zombies want far away possible. realistically want test different jurisdiction don’t get sued. safe ways hang beach unsafe ways. “spring break” style mobs saw big transmitters.

Nah, mentioned months ago likely October, weeks ago, changed “autumn”, 22 September 21 December.   Bill Gates sponsoring it. Real question American sponsor British?  Could elope wedding party usually bad taste Despite cruelty family members, world better lived. Please keep that- outliving fools best revenge. take vaccine vote Trump. Honestly, hospitalizations may overflow again. second wave here, people feared hospital overflows Texas, Florida, states affected second wave never materialized. Part reason hospital know deal virus lot better March. I’m 100% sure, argued hospitals may overflow again. one died they? Ohh okay good see we’re page 😅 feel like that's plan big push reopen schools Yeah, fuck small business owners trying make living. stay home time give Amazon money  Test plebs first. know real cost rest us decide. Yeah basically experience too. People think distanced don’t need mask, mask don’t need distance. Personally liken car crash... take precautions get crash, damn chance get one want seatbelt airbags. actually suicidal thoughts first time years therapy two months ago. wanted end all; however, kids kept buying pistol follow it.

Don't worry, fine now, talk therapist it. help uncaring crook president political party give flying fuck us schmucks. Oohhhhhhhhh boy. Major sympathetic elbow bumps. mean go ICU..I pay deductible..so would never million dollar debt rest us know real, also know fact adminstration going due diligence protect lives effort reopen economy, much less protect us unsafe effective treatments. make sense. saying wear mask get case covid less severe wearing mask get crappy joke coincidence student happened Wuhan.

The ""joke"" supposed ridicule reactions/treatments many Chinese Chinese Americans received due pandemic.

While joke may stupid somewhat insensitive, think intended hateful/racist/disparaging comment, headline seems imply.

I think professor apologize think lose job. fiance planning elope anyway. However, wanted splurge expensive holiday exotic location it. Americans allowed anywhere. Brazil run Trumpian strongman. Don’t believe anything hear coming country. Oh, shes lost cause.

Firmly ""Bill Gates caused COVID cover sex trafficking control us"" camp. Sure, bad literally risking everyone around life (whether intentional, willfully ignorant) clearly something right. There's big problem physical health world, clearly there's big problem mental health well, think needs talked treated - pandered to. bars full people close masks.

How mask good idea eat drink anyways, bring up? sense ninth-grader. Reply back 25 years. you. Never seen orgy tent Bulls game, friend. Watching humanity mess, makes want pack dogs move remote planet get run 2 days. tired mostly. Totally still worth - available Canada another month though.

For reason love isolation. Never really realized much introvert was, didn’t make excuses go others haha. go so? I’ve seen good things phase 3 vaccine trials relevant.

And trying doing. sources believe companies inventive rush vaccine. Trump acting like big baby going change that. Even - catholic schools 20k year outrageous amount. Source: mom sent one Midwest LPN salary. absolutely get get married year, fuckin elope.

This get. wedding supposed MEMORABLE. could totally simple, small ceremony, small portion money save, rent slick RV drive somewhere cool like beautiful state park. rest life able tell people got married once-a-century pandemic special honeymoon Yellowstone. interesting ""we rented hall everyone danced hokey-pokey cake, like every wedding last 50 years""? simply understand national sewage monitoring program put place back Feb/March.

We national heatmaps based data public treatment facilities every campus based organization (casinos, resorts, universities, jobsites) testing. know this- employer tries call back office, going back office.... one time, give back work laptop. Yep that's big one. get single take margarita 8 bucks buy entire 6 pack beer bottle wine 8 bucks normal store (both options ""to go"" anyway difference).

For open spaces, table 'Get Smart' cone silence overhead. Multiple Taiwanese citizens tested positive overseas, led suspicion potential coverup domestically. due wedding last weekend friend mine. ended going isn’t speaking me. 😕  Catholic schools often prorate tuition based income. Truth, lets forget increasing obvious hard ignore effects climate change. Even people balls admit yet, still see level fucked (on multiple fronts) days numbered.  Yes! really bad postpartum anxiety kids. giving birth past May, mentioned OB concerned anxiety. delivery, find 12 hour old newborn sitting lecture hospital pediatrician anxious COVID. Thanks, anxiety nothing COVID everything kid gave birth accompanying joyful hormones. Thank god don’t. would easily lead fucking disaster. Irrelevant. said there's evidence he's interfering. trying to, regardless whether works. bragging? surprised? colleges opening? Netflix social media people they're bored work, alone end day.

The rest time they're needing bars restaurants order feel normal. medical condition allow wearing mask? went catholic school. 
This great news. Sometimes. depends selective pressure coronavirus infect multiple species, it’s lot less predictable. take lot brain cells realize Trump supporting bikers probably following recommendations CDC wearing masks. guess depends field in. I’m tradesman bought house 25 last recession. went school two years don’t degree. think growing knowledge tradesman make bank. electrician, plumber heavy equipment operator make easy six figures degree years experience. Well pack gang. Per upper middle class white girl high schools Instagram story, talk reopening getting back normal “COVID gaslighting”. unemployed probably easier unemployment benefits. people see examples hear news. Yeah bet 'agreed' willingly Wow. U cleva. one assholes subtly pushes people around gf putting for, literally, years.

That's people know they're probably making poor decision wanna anyway they're selfish. try bully-recruit people justifying decisions. happened past pandemics... Thanks heads up... I'm currently getting MN UI, little less $400 thought max was... I'm self-employed business seriously affected covid (artist/art shows) I'm glad I'm getting anything year.

So payment actually higher thought, there's reason people covid take couple weeks quarantine/heal. Yeah right! totally want sounds way cheaper (the actual wedding procedure), cuase organize party food reception ceremony thing don’t think understand many entire industries ground absolute halt shutdown. Hundreds thousands jobs, maybe entertainment industry alone. Also, argument old effect relevance today given still at? trust: 

1) personal experience 
2) articles
3) doctor trenches 

Way trust dumb opinion. No. CDC FDA non political. plaza azteca burrito called burrito san jose comes smothered delicious cheesy white salsa - moved away havent one 10 years fatass got excited saw photo Hilarious. amazing wit......... alcohol/beverage sales. know get go well think fraction they'd typically sell people sitting restaurant Alright dude. Let know months anger mind. live place enacted strict rules managed make work, less 5 active cases currently last checked whole province... universities ramping up, regular schools opening bars/pubs totally given social distancing everyone gets drunk impossible control effectively. 

It's going take one two cases wrong place wrong time progress lost here. Wtf? exact health officials ones approve whether vaccine gets distributed. actually I'm at. I'm fortunate enough completely isolate myself. guess people want roll dice herd-immunity option deal 2-5 million deaths...well...go it. funny part em didn’t even bother hide identity mask looted Target. sure Qatar, 40% obesity rate US (10% Singapore) probably help. basically want world practically shut another decade? Days uptick cases south west US watched cable news program [that's really news program] telling millions viewers there's evidence masks work. think formative feedback norm anyways. doesn’t help struggling teacher one major evaluation spring, observed regularly helpful.

My school Zoom principal pops every see kids managing, it’s helpful discussing things, idea classes going. Makes sense. they? Nothing really Earth matters since live paradise among eternity. covid deniers living fantasy world. refuse accept fact easily transmissible indoors. cannot in-person schooling unless basically transmission community. community, meeting groups indoors extended periods time disaster.

It's obvious. would that? Lots research showing herd immunity threshold much lower anyway. Look much writing. look little I'm writing. loony one? distinction being? I’d rather get coronavirus eight times doofuses collage absolutely agree you, think example life fair. seem reward bad behavior, end day benefitting society whole. Yeah, stuff posted several days ago. Click baity then, click baity now. STILL think hoax? like trump I’m simply fear-monger.  doesn’t mean ignore virus pretend it’s fake.  I’m sick idiots sub trying present extinction level event trying drive rest us abject poverty prove political point. guess he's updated latest science. came bring division living word God hypocrites.

In words, Jesus would whipping whole lot pastors churches came back. Bruh I'm sure anywhere near 10 years hence think distrust xD  certainty COVID yet. probabilities. However data COVID says mask sucks. Social distancing washing hands works. 

The certain hard hit countries bending curve similar deaths per capita. course kind immunity. indeed. Surreal. They're going close point. can't large groups inside safely. hard understand, hard get people accept.  question ""Why?"" Thankfully spelling mistakes direct indicator competency. 

Performing safety theatre plebs get uppity gam gam gets Covid house cards economy can't deal brief interlude consumption.... Decidedly less so.

Won't somebody think commercial real estate developers! Thanks, it’s important put faces numbers. It’s insanely frustrating hear someone say can’t teach learn without mask it’s “nonsensical”. We’ve back school masks, that’s EASIEST part changes right teachers students. winter everyone goes indoors throw social distancing window + droplets last longer air well less moisture air drier winter air. Several mini-strokes No. look posting stupid things there.. Mr. Epidemiologist? know long term consequences are, seem significant seem hit high percentage people infected (even asymptomatic). 

Case counts take time. We've seen four week delays holidays, surprising see take least long. schools same, mask mandates fare better. Still, wish able bet idea cases rise get fall, think exceedingly likely. windows shut cold weather, see lasting long. Hope I'm wrong. man, whole family started taking vitamin back March. even back then. I’m Manhattan, I’m still leaving place little possible given common areas travel even get outside. wear mask, don’t want play odds game too-too much. 

At time, I’m happy people getting testing waters. *is* good know works doesn’t, part people willing guinea pigs (or tbh ngaf it).

(I’ve also got fingers crossed heat lamps keeping fave places going I’m prepared take subway again.) Ah okay. thought every school, bad. That’s happening brothers school anyway. Cured gotten now? People talk like streets littered dead bodies, hospitals facing collapse bullshit. None happened, actually thought things going get way worse, never close overwhelm healthcare system. handled well, thing wrong act early enough prevent spreading nursery homes. Otherwise fine 7th september 2020. countries going approach tactic sooner later whether want admit not. Implication: pro-maskers uneducated. Going gym healthy definitely worth risk currently Phase III least 3 vaccines USA alone. someone went wedding came back uninfected, would act going immoral?

Yes (X) doubt would get right away trust vaccines availability based good science, politics. accurate descriptive term might ""morbidly obese"". Would prefer wording instead? one reasons testing period takes 10-15 years.... 

Exploratory Stage 

Pre-Clinical Stage 

IND Application 

Phase Vaccine Trials 

Phase II Vaccine Trials 

Phase III Vaccine Trials 

Post-Licensure Monitoring Vaccines 

Phase IV Trials Asian countries bunch stuff people would flip shit over; South Korea briefly possibly never even closed nightclubs.

Comparisons Asia west basically worthless, every ""they wear masks train complain it!"" equal opposite example way locked down. honestly blame considering badly public health orgs failed americans.

I'm 100% pro vaccine I'm tremendously skeptical supposedly working Russian vaccine Putin touting. raises many red flags... like telling Russia ready months? don't, school day today, mask saw day own.


Might differ school school, that's sort point, schools left figure going get wrong. Showing incredibly dumb actually are. I'm hans Christian Anderson! Everyone needs see this. I've supplementing 1800IU per day since early May. online class. see video link. wonder keep morals high pubs restaurants neighbourhood school closed also ? I’m still laughing. soooo cute trying imply someone commentary. gross, I’m glad I’m you. love me, legit take zero saying truth bc I’m fully aware reality family. It’s kinda scary think actually attempt say anything anyone’s fam situation you’re anon behind keyboard. Wow that’s little mentally unstable don’t think?! Mental illness fixed seek help, pray do! Again, bullies usually terrible time life, self esteem, friends, mental instability, chemical imbalances, usually attractive, can’t hold job relationship. keep praying you. Bc one normal amazing tells another person know nothing family hates like THATS PSYCHOTIC! Get well. Lol Seeing cluster-fuck American post-secondary schooling makes grateful boring, sensible approach universities colleges took Canada. majority classes went online, residences partial capacity. International students attend classes remotely home countries without visas compromised.  


Enrollment universities colleges down, usually modestly - low single digit percentages. There's cut-backs far nothing catastrophic except Alberta, government cutting PSE funding COVID. We've infected students, again, individual cases.  


Everyone carry like vaccine. That's story COVID America one quote. I’m happy didn’t go high death toll hate suspicion came it. lime..... disease? It’s right get people infected possibly deadly illness. 

You can’t go completely naked bc endangers safety comfort others. It’s concept mask, except case someone died instead disturbed public nudity. Dont feed trolls Perhaps smidge spin. investigative mission follow, pretty clear Boris hospital Covid months ago apparently learn anything. That's great, mother die someone bother wait two weeks bit daft me. Random unprotected sex specific situation. around people know, get food survive vastly different scenario. Everyone different results. Good choice. sub full propaganda people trying politicize vaccines despite fact research data public. Plastics react bleach, I'm going need see citations low concentration bleach solutions leaching plastic containers. quick searching around internet part failed bring results support claim. plenty prep time tho. Experts warned kind stuff decades willing stay open matter what, even bother reopening, cases inevitable start popping up. angry. Stay inside, rest us, including family, clearly need you. ebbs flows me, days I’m fine, mid August two weeks daily panic attacks around new chest pain having. get everything checked it’s normal, doctor explains powerful brain panic attacks create symptoms aren’t “real”. It’s maddening, like what’s real what’s not, healthy undiagnosed issue I’m gonna drop dead tomorrow. Anyways, I’m mess lol. He's right, 8. 8 millions pretty much non issue, least Asian countries leading way “Weddings bullshit anyway”

“My wife got married park”

So wedding bullshit? Healthcare system BD already fucked beyond repair long time 2020 persons vulnerable already died/ dying irrespective virus. /r/ihadastroke 
When link includes “probably” “interpretation” facts also includes “probably”, point considering part valid respect? nation may trending down, likely result downward trends populous states. 

Isn’t good thing? think NY Texas trending downward would bigger deal state like Wyoming Montana trending upward. Especially youngest kids adapt quickest us recognizing people despite masks. Every day catching Covid sounds attractive. I'd love go permanent disability allowance long-haul ""fatigue."" I'm really wage slave, developing taste free money first lockdown UBI/wage subsidy/jobkeeper support. Yeah ironic can’t imagine hospital bill. Fuck Twitter tbh. Vaccine rolled winter/early spring


Source? part I'm glad son going Springfield College. Small school (less 5k students), Greek life campus, huge sense community. Add school issued policy pretty severe consequences\* caught, we're hopeful make Thanksgiving. 


\* VP student affairs, sent students parents: 
Students take COVID seriously put entire community risk. forced pivot remote learning, EVERYONE pivots remote learning. Everyone goes home take classes bedrooms rest semester. want that. want that.

So, writing provide fair warning **any student hosting attending large party social gathering (on campus) suspended Springfield College**. \[Note: talking Springfield College sponsored events.\] able take classes in-person remotely receive refunds tuition, room, board. student club, organization, team hosts event, organization suspended, college recognition withdrawn entire academic year.  dunno France, CA antivax movement wealthy, liberal areas. OC, West Hollywood, Santa Monica, Berkeley. There’s monopoly stupid. You’re much better everyone else man. You’re spot wise that? It’s novel virus, first global pandemic 100 years, aren’t winging it? 

Schools opening soon damn sure, they’ll close many kids get sick community numbers go back roof, surely? encouraging people take risks file big lawsuits profit? ASSHOLES! California trending downward quite nicely, idiots come around disrupt progress. That's great. work restaurant. Everything's gonna like always was. buy Amazon directly. injured legally sue lot money. Thankfully posters sub basement dwellers won’t pass anything on. ""give"" exchange loans? get answer? probably safe made mistake letting Johnson in. There’s probably less safe person Britain.  pic different person story. show video guy rolled legs. Still, amputations result complications get this. smart unbiased person back envelope math tell greater threat covid itself? Yellowstone Super Volcano wipe humanity point

Only humanity earth. 

Eggs baskets theory need argue spaceflight.   definitely relate booing I’m right? I’m similar boat. Moved across country January, shit really hit fan here. end February everything shut hardly time explore new home. Shit sucks.

At least I’m people greatly care about, it’s disheartening see awful things going world. Though bad situation COVID, COVID worsened symptoms.

That’s say I’m sadness hipster!! Lol know hard everybody. patience vigilance help everyone end Well listen, earth always continue long humanity gone. heals rebound even climate environment affected. There's nothing it, makes feel better there's life planets probably similar here. universe infinite, we're small grain sand cosmos. planet may intentionally seeded life, there's something think literally free

I never paid flu shot entire life would whining rationing using blackout curtains windows. definitely enough, weighed properly. What’s positivity rate? finally trending downward Proper leadership would wonders regards providing right information many people possible. consensus yet amd know exact R0. said, estimates right around 70%.

It's like read anything linked to. enjoy science lets math 320,000,000 X .3 = 96,000,000 infected Fatality rate 2% X 96,000,000 = 1,920,000 Even incredibly optimistic numbers, almost 2 MILLION dead. 

What talking about?

First, making case anything, pointing NYC probably right around herd immunity already. crying it? saying bad they're already there?

Second, US population right, all, even doing?

Third, CFR 2%? lmao?

But beside point I'm proposing anything, I'm pointing NYC basically there. Sorry bothers you? wish wasn't? Okay, that's weird. Let burn. Don’t accept hospitals. Smooth edit..... first thought: would ask use neighbors toilet?

Then remebered whole ventilation thing Hong Kong apartment complex believe realized. Feels like years since read must six months damn Abnormal; new normal makes sense I’m see lot compliance understanding kids going school following mask distancing rules (like nieces nephews) grown ass adults can’t help got parties, bars, weddings... Australian here. conservative Federal Government PM said multiple occasions vaccine close mandatory make it. Various governments proven effective making difficult exist anti-vaxxer eligible welfare, eligible places schools. miss rich 'wellness' nutjiobs plenty anti-vaxxers government could fail see economic benefit free vaccines beyond me. really encouraging news. Hopefully record setting trend continued distribution. chest pain, first time I've experiencing fatigue turns actual pain. joints muscles ache. Motivation hard find. Every often, I'll week need take naps every day last several hours. really want eat every day either. ability think clearly comes goes. Literally never experienced degree, *never* summer.

Today first time month I've gotten exercise, long could go twenty minutes. really feel like puking. feel better it, least go bed hating missing another day.

I'm going try workout hard schedule. 8pm every day; I'll set alarm it. Tonight first night it. know get exercise, eat better sleep better without conscious effort, helps mental health lot. tough though. Especially feel achy; really want workout days.

I can't imagine much must suck someone deal sort stuff every day ever began. Hang there. Hopefully find something helps. wish spent last couple years investing hobby can't happen durring covid. main outlet stress depression. Like triple numbers bud. (175+?) 9 deaths fair, people spreading horseshit US vaccines. would absolutely fascinated see either antibodies (may declined 3 months) T-cell immunity. idea haven’t virus contacting mucous membrane exposure gazillion virions seems unlikely me. probably sitting much chest muscles contracted little posture. People depressed usually exercise certainly work well together. Usually, non-responders SSRI's alone thrown Wellbutrin complement. lessen sexual side effects. Patio heaters? Maybe dead winter helping autumn. learned early enough examples people similar situations, maybe could prevented child winding hospital. 

Just like mothers behaving like did, still won’t care child also ends hospital. frustrating seeing people give shit.

I get choice health issues. can't imagine health cavalier possibly losing even take simple precautions, like hosting house party. lol mentioned 5 sources, let stop loling million people ""re-educated"" lol. Go jog outside sunlight daily least 15 min per day. Take vitamins ensure proper non processed diet. Speak often opposite gender via dating apps possible. Yeah, assumed us already N95 masks, could encouraged us wear actually STOP SHIT. can't believe, six months shit, people still think masks protect people you?

Now they're available online (not cheap though) people still wear them. masks protect people sick...  sad watching US less willingly cede longstanding position world leader infectious disease control schools opened... consensus yet amd know exact R0. said, estimates right around 70%.

But lets math 30%.

320,000,000 X .3 = 96,000,000 infected 
Fatality rate 2% X 96,000,000 = 1,920,000
Even incredibly optimistic numbers, almost 2 MILLION dead. 

I know, math hard, even this. Technically, KN95s higher standards Yes, now. time, numbers seeing news saying 10% Italy, specifically. countries were, time, lower. Italy quite high time. sorry loss ❤️ unfair one person’s selfishness affect everyone. mean yeah north fucking sucks right thanks restrictions Jeeze yeah even nuance covid situation aside, someone's threatening leave one disagreement even them... sorry that's harsh. similar sentiment making social media rounds country.

We locked hard fast March, progressively around May-June thing started open September last importante restrictions finally lifted. (We third world rich). much roll scaled, open (except nightclubs large events). It’s close six months. national mask mandate (and social distance hygiene pedagogy campaigns EVERYWHERE) people saying was: “at point, going understand, did. gonna learn, learned. That’s it. save everybody longer”. relate much now. real tragedy victims everything right perish reckless . Really, really hate “It’s big deal, people free want” always turning “We didn’t take seriously, regret loved one hit hard virus. serious, people.

""If able, try chemo. Think depression rule cancer treat like one"" contagious logical assume everyone eventually get it? Especially since death rate low, perfect time contract COVID (under assumption everyone eventually infected point - believe case) cold/flu season real sickness begins. Masks, even effective (limited-no evidence are), delaying inevitable dragging negative economic social consequences (economic downturns kill, too). include vulnerable, means keep hidden away rest us go out, get sick short while, recover, create antibodies - eventually left infect antibodies, that's herd immunity takes effect virus dies naturally - way since beginning time.

I've taking Prozac since March 2016. finally able get job December 2016 able fake-smile way interview. worked movie theater March 8. 2020- laid COVID. never really felt depressed time working.

This think business shutdowns worth it. causing depression, causing financial pains distress last decades people. Depression, suicides, drug alcohol abuse rampant areas rust belt factories shut down. governors like Cuomo Newsom shutting entire states permanently killing small businesses. 

I really see much future state California businesses can't re-open soon. competent leaders could implement program like this. Yeah, neighborhood Toronto, long-standing locally owned restaurants extremely well takeout, locals know food good buying helps people know personally. Chain restaurants, hand, anywhere near well. &amp; Pelosi - mayor Chicago thing. Yes Trump, Gov Whitmer MI number appearances didn’t wear mask either. Also, mayor Philadelphia dined restaurant trip Maryland banned indoor dining Philly. It’s pretty easy see people don’t treat like crisis people telling it’s crisis don’t treat way either. word. edge sessions 4+ hours pure nut busting joy.

Surprised it’s higher.  Hey, thanks. I’d also like thank part. I’ve five kids since March. People still upsetting me. neighbors people today. people street party. It’s heartening hear others still holding line too. understand people need work necessary things. parties “small get togethers” become spreading events - shit needs stop. People listened warned Trump would ruin country. Well don’t care reason is, see absolute win religion much dangerous disease virus. using track drug use too. Well gunman better buy lottery ticket. rare hit one victim fallen-bullets, let alone 3. really common alcohol, students drink campus get trouble even legal depending school Virus fatigue?

Asia holding steady virus 3 months earlier still holding steady. 

Australia battling new wave infections Melbourne going new lockdown. 

New Zealand fighting small new resurgence, went new lockdown.

Everyone still fighting holding strong.

How America virus fatigue even done anything?? You’re real dad! sucks people see numbers say something like, ""not everyone got cares?""

Pathetic country result pathetic people. We're thankful wonderful humor! Sadness hipster genius *Raises hand* Frats.

Up last month list peer reviewed scientific articles along lists links debunking every blasted thing said. truly worked close breakdown trying educate people. 

Bottom line want educated. prefer willfully ignorant. 

I 4 adult children 2 oldest land willfully ignorant category. One mother three grandchildren choices can't see told ""Nana paranoid want around."" would take wearing masks maintaining social distance refuse ""the death rate 1%"" (despite evidence contrary long term effects).

All said.... put info strongly feel must. argue. point pandemic nobody going change stance / beliefs. entire world proven done acceptable proof. I'm even seeing lot people get infected horrible time healing STILL say masks worthless flu. 

We even discuss idiots claim virus miraculously end November 4. Although comment always ""Yes! can't wait whole world breathe sigh relief. 'dead' come hiding sick quit faking go back normal.""

Save heartache. Wish best want high road get take long time heal want join low road . Can't wait US criticize China giving away vaccine countries free should’ve said wedding peaceful protest would’ve immune coronavirus Really sad still happening. Testing also another thing still problem MN (and whole country). lot places starting say take asymptomatic getting test result less 48 hours impossible. mom's test result took week, example.

Embarrassing still happening prepared now, can't say I'm surprised look who's charge country. Students held accountable campus behavior norm American colleges, don’t like it’s going really hard find school won’t punish students inappropriate conduct campus Something bad without worst possible thing. competition. Same. made similar point another comment too. 

One thing helped work situation forcing walk away work end day, sign everything etc. 

I figured couple weeks ago, six months wake start work work sleep. thought flexible started way gradually became consuming. establish hard boundaries. 

What worked couple weeks ago forced take days signed email chat etc. went back signed desktop phone. phone work free zone two weeks feels great. can't see ever going back work chat etc phone I'm teleworking. 

You draw line. 

Also advice continue personal care etc still going work. neglect otherwise. thought always true. wrong. Simple things like teeth get screwed caring everyday. easy forget things like days blur together. important set routine stick it. still struggle set time etc personally. hard mentally need care house cares wearing yesterday's clothes, become cares showing work pajamas every day week nobody see anyway. slowly hate yourself, wake one day realize depression looks like. weaned Zoloft back Jan/Feb. things going good. started taking week. whole bunch kids going screwed this. Pulling kids away lives friends months lasting consequences many. fine, Minnesota January? outdoor dining/drinking largely shuts good chunk winter best times, especially suburbs. People absolutely adapt going rough restaurants. Wow here, comment, jeez... get idea anything works. That's fine guess. Go get hair cut American.

It seems think can't control behavior (which absolutely can, even big ask) even try. 

What silly way be. point, left news people selfish is, ""Fuck 'em."" work rule can’t go bar everyone works office unnecessarily endangers coworkers yeah, fire you. Regardless state rules employers private decide want. Colleges different. Wtf Coronabro?

It's scary bad reading comprehension. think woodstock cancelled Flu Pandemic year. mentioned flu pandemic mild compared covid19 flu seasonality problem summer.

but apparently well informed woodstock epidemiology. expect see Grand Forks Herald r/all. long take vaccinate people?  true, pope. disgusting pig. Makes sense schools shutting Yet another government bureaucracy innocuous confusing data/coding update conspiracy theorists run amok. Charge them

Reddit fucking quick pull trigger anyone upvotes kind comment retarded think COVID isn’t real. Enjoy echo chamber salty leftists. I've answered question. rest straw man answer question. provide evidence (PCR testing) protestors conclusively points negative results, posts bullshit disingenuous. 2% death rate say 80 million Americans infected (25% population) still 1.6 million. 25% infection isn’t unreasonable time next year. I’m going guarantee it, think significant, non zero chance reaching it. saying, look potential virus things start adding up. Especially possibility temporary immunity you’ve fought vaccinated. virus endemic. doubt we’ll able stamp even national lockdown. seems long term asymptomatic carriers virus well. way people behave... think gloomy perspective quite valid. even 2 weeks since schools opened, things get interested uk boys Privilege testing something kill you? Wow. too

My mom grandparents came stayed sister. flew, quarantined afterwards. quarantined drove 12 hours. 

It’s doable. like family people get tested small portion population, sympomatic people. Many people get dose virus symptoms few. death rate much lower 3%. saying like owe us. absolute minimum could do. live one English cities experiencing spike cases weekend. large number people given avoiding getting sick. people wear mask socially distance shopping. Large numbers house parties held. 
I worry poorer areas England never become virus free people areas know best ignore government guidelines. already comprehensive unified national strategy defeat COVID-19, however objective end pandemic shortest period time least amount death illness possible. Although could objective, fact assumed many objective, fails take account full range short long term consequences pursuing narrow-minded objective ultimately judged unrealistic naive people decide kinds things.

For shocked this, look approach challenge scale. Really think it. What’s process? decides? get deciders? role play that? role could play still play? Plenty time left. None going away tomorrow.

Okay dude, try keep making random assumptions based reddit comments don’t say. LOL, ""virus fatigue"". Except get take couple months, life really changed all.

I thought shit we’re required backed science.

What’s next? I’ll called science-denier won’t follow WHO-approved power prayer regimen? We're number one! Yes, still basic math. know maths hard, try follow along:

If takes 60% population infected achieve herd immunity (we know Covid yet. may high 90%) then
320,000,000 (pop US) X .6 = 192,000,000 infected. real fatality rate .02 (it's probably higher) 3,840,000 dead. using optimistic numbers. saying? medical-grade respirators? N95 describes filtration capability material, whether makes airtight seal. [Longer video can't believe they'd fire this. hospitalizations. deaths. big deal. Maybe brought frozen water bottles throw police, looting started fires. Dr. Fauci issue gatherings. San Diego inundated tourists right now. They're trashing beaches, wearing masks. Really love county goes less restrictive tiers right holiday coming up. semester online? Definitely Exactly. too. found exercise house go walk bit really helps mood. &amp;#x200B;

TSA confiscates water reason want spray shit down. Uhm, currently 0% immunity, 50% effective vaccine back January would saved least 100k people US alone.

I think understand %s vaccines. got abolish Indian act, treat Canadians equal. I'm happy made through.

Also, aside, ""Queens Future"" one shirts could buy Espresso 77. one own. Bang on, exactly screaming months. knew damn well would end position candidate vaccines Phase III lack public awareness got here. Regulatory bodies trusted public engagement teams place months ago. could open communication step, produced format easily digested processed populace instead trying back track explain got here. I’ve unfollow lot people Facebook mute words Twitter bring sanity back platforms. amount insanity shared mind boggling.

Even people thought level headed turned crazy. someone seen friends Vegas pandemic times, say main strip seriously packed all. safer going beach far I'm concerned.   F*** a-hole idiots charge happens. guy hometown known prior health issues. Father 5, basketball coach, dead covid 44 daughters underestimate shit. Let’s reward people bad behavior! not.

I'm staunchly individualistic wear mask I'm stupid. Blame ignorance, free will. lot time takes develop vaccine due fact takes longer diseases prevalent, lot red tape cut save time.

But vaccines still going proper studies trials terms safety efficacy. see information data trials thus far. IIRC, biggest worry comes vaccine side effects early on. vaccines well way shown safe potential effective. OP here: missing, fixed (the raw data countries split region/province, write code aggregate data last few). let know country looking still missing. Walking maskless agaisnt vaccines, seems like trash taking then. interviewing top spot administration prepared answer question indepth real examples:

     ""How well LIE?"" sure. Feel free PM socialism. think already saw people actually (and mean ACTUALLY) followed lockdowns best practices would little economy crippling proved countries.

And even crippling, I'd take allowing virus kill many people.

The ""nothing"" part necessarily said seeing responses leaderships, people refuse wear masks on. May well cardboard box. I'm sorry, talking about? lives ruined due Gardasil? references find sites called things like ""My vaccine lawyer dot com."" also allow teachers completely ignore rules. teachers show going work. Especially days need know classrooms safe. can't hope people follow rules issue. 
Being forced dangerous situation mean give checks already danger. checks precisely forced unsafe conditions make sure everyone still safe. want go bullshit making sure safe, make sure safe would say sending first paragraph comment good enough explanation. 

Otherwise could always attend keep far distance possible stay dinner. significant attended wedding agreed ever felt unsafe would walk out. one point felt unsafe went sit outside main group. It’s debated health professionals Denmark throwing money away test strategy. Also outbreak Aarhus said healthy people wanting test took resources sick people needed it. 
Living Denmark must say test regime impressive. There’s lot cases going slip undetected don’t know they’re panicking recent (small) surge cases. I’m Swedish think Denmark handled generally well apart weird political decisions much difference except extra administration. youre probably gonna avoid human contact vaccine/cure matter are. well walk around street, maskless selfish morons mainly 40yo male ... so... .

oh, I'm french, female, educated 49yo, wear mask since lockdown march soon step appartment, even get mail lobby.

and NO, I'm *not* named Karine ;-) start-ups facemasks eventually widely available. widely available store besides onlinestores customers must ask certain items larger numbers stores take notice buy supply customers ask for. Sometimes stores anticipate wishes constant pressure masks widely available think would masks available eventually.

In beginning pandemic national stockpile personal protective equipment almost everywhere except Finland. last big epidemic SARS MERS decided national level start produce stockpile PPE. got pandemic Finland opened stockpile enough go around.

The masks tested standards PPE marked accordingly. can't moment remember correct standards tell look for.

I hope people using masks coming months stop spread infectious SARS-COV-2-virus, people get sick covid-19 later die covid-19. hope efforts going towards creating vaccines searching therapeutics.

There things help besides wearing mask wash hands soap water. eat good nutritional food. read upon want know essential oils, vitamins minerals certain herbs plants help improve immune system reduce infections.

Since coronavirus pandemic started, public health officials United States faced harassment death threats, even [driven university deeply involved studying virus warned hundreds researchers lookout dangerous packages.

Haven't left house 2 weeks, super sad hear people forced endanger loved ones exist.. 

But forreal normalize washing hands covering face yet? 

That original 2 week lockdown kinda taking little longer... 6 months longer something like Maybe disproportionately higher number refuse wear masks, almost professions required wear masks entire shift? I'm joking...kinda. think thinking generation that. women 50s generation actually women going college, trend going since mid-1960s. numbers overtook men whose numbers going since early 1970s. believe women 70s minority universities. still dinosaurs teaching administration time though, still bit fight, like before. 


And another commenter said, mean learned anything. still classes way back when, amazing number people wanted memorize stuff spout back get grades. actually care learning deep down. wanted follow formula. Sadly plenty degree programs allowed graduate that.  Oh jesus, remember rumor circulating pandemic started America black people immune it? Since previous survey, guidance came would get vaccines first. people paying attention know first wave getting it. typical human reaction say, ""I going wait anyway."" everyone thinks way, many people do. change response ""to expected"" worrying. drivers follow rules part country, lol experimenting people forcing wear masks count? can’t wait there’s vaccine? seems entirely unfair athletes potentially risking careers, even kind strict bubble system US planiffs bar unlike countries.  Make loser pay see happens lawsuits. 

There commission compensates people vaccine injuries.  

As Gardasil...  Cervical Cancer women good either, penis cancer men.. No, can't. Apparently, familiar teaching standards. Due limitations technology, attendance, possible interruptions due coronavirus, way standards Instead, let free kids suffer. still jobs do

Here's idea: parents step plate actually *parent*? years, private public school systems used abused underfunded daycare. Teachers essentially babysitters/second parents parents receive economy-destroying tax breaks 'special privileges.' time, parents reason kids suffer: they're drug addicts, narcissists/abusive, poor (middle class poor child), undereducated (most Americans barely read add). Stop blaming teachers essentially parent-caused problem. Go visit friends....seriously get Reddit that's telling never leave house see people. I'm advocating anyone go packed rave something going friend's house hangout fine. Disregard advice 80 years old chemo something, young healthy fine. COVID knows fear. Yeah hatred really widespread days first time life laughed heard someone died (Herman Cain). asshole spread covid denier theories, went maskless indoor trump rally. felt like karmic justice died. I’ve also cursed person public maybe second time life refused wear mask wouldn’t go away. I’m normally like that, genuinely see people risk family. 

I hate covid deniers anti maskers. neighbors (college town) parties every weekend month. I’ve already lost one loved one virus blame them. sympathy left them. hope karma finds all. listen current administration pigs fly seen many articles refering test positivity rate ""infection rate"". point term basically redefined dictionary. (rolls eyes) *think* meant say ""Positive test rate almost within 1% time lows,"" i.e., 5.3%, vs. 4.3% June. That's definitely progress, lots countries seeing values well 2%.

It’s fucking infuriating people know think bars schools closed, yet they’re going other’s houses hanging without masks distancing. 

A lot people probably going suffer somehow completely lost ability hold accountable. article really shows power media framing headlines. 56% still showed lung damage 12 weeks!

From headline would think breathing issues due covid go away eventually. 12 weeks long time Covid infection suggests damage likely permanent degree large number patients. mean ''effect size''?

What would expect see ''critical care illness'' makes unbelievable?

We're talking preventative measures stop people getting critical care stage, critical care itself.  hashtag corona :( least they're better americans People like party - worry? Attitude Social anxiety disorder here, hear you. I've never considered depression anxiety certainly make feel depressed, persistent anxiety make daily life feel impossible. Like make phone call doctor today (or tomorrow since I'm likely put because... anxiety), feels like die conversation someone. live like that? feel like living. Zero work due mass unemployment. also specified essential workers, combined health care, would make least 20% population US. Essential workers meaning bus drivers, grocery store workers, TSA agents, fast food employees, pharmacy employees, etc. Although 20% figure gave example, obviously idea sort threshold needed yet push R0 1. I'm going go evil side stupid evil. really. actually read comment, would notice specifically referred town, municipality. excuse one highest death rates world. would ask ventilation systems like, HVAC filters.

And believe one two time cut funding NIH CDC. Think one time.

Think vote. way vote early, vote time. Umm, no, talking deaths per capita right? So, total population nothing it. That's failure understand difference data per capita statistics aggregate stats part. also far less dense Northeast states. advantage months prepare, better treatment, testing, etc. still 15th worst deaths per capita rising, killing nursing home residents per capita resident NY. objectively ""average."" That's shitshow. Yeah top 5% caused pandemic first place China business meetings vacation houses Italy stuff. That's celebrities got general population. Serious side effects take many many YEARS come surface too. Coronavirus like: Challenge accepted!

I feel like clip Terminator 2 one world experienced situation order fairly judge performance conditions. Students area going school 2 days per week (to start year). determine expected education performance conditions? certainly previous years, current standards based on.

If anything, resources normally used judged education performance diverted judge well classrooms adhering state's health guidelines. cases older people able shield effectively, live house kids. Also, even people isolating come contact humans then, they're buying groceries, repairman comes house fix something. playing politics virus virus thinks it’s funny! shut border Sweden?

Trump? f'n way word. It’s job wait medical bill comes... MI, IL, PA high numbers, fault. federal government screwed everything up. GA, FL, TX high numbers, blame. totally preventable.

Come on, population thing. GA 9th populous, 6th cases, 15th deaths. seems totally expected. Nearly states fall line population except NY, NJ, CT MA. Compared everyone else (that includes states like), GA fine. Letter headmaster quoted near end article:

“Due timing news, precautionary measure, requesting students following classes/groups please remain home tomorrow “(Monday September 7).


Nothing wearing masks on? Although consulting Health safety. ever try snri? add things talk therapy, light therapy/d3 supplement regimens, eco therapy (spending time nature), practicing mindfulness, even mini doses lithium augmenting med (there others oldest known reduce suicidality, even antidepressants alone). hope feel better soon That's responsible government pursue herd immunity strategy. [Oh get serology analysis depending igm igg data figure still contagious not. did. think large portion won’t trust anything released current regime. It’s untrustworthy - undermined many institutions supposed keeping public safe - even safe vaccine likely met skepticism *surprise* anyone following pandemic?

I mean people drinking bleach, bleach Electrolytes, must COVID craves! Fox News toxic, CNN/MSN others equally guilty running random quotes, peddling theories statements fact, turning whole pandemic horse race “Oh god! states badly!” “Here’s race vaccine!” expect? college, worried shouldn’t kids back school.

Yeah, that's mentioned ""definitely problems racism more"". recent stuff around time also touch it. actual fuck playing fotball anyways. Slogan: Enjoy free Corona! Sounds like food poisoning. Vitamin D. Número uno! daily deaths roughly They're actually falling continue fall hospitalizations keep falling front them. blatant misinformation get updooted godforsaken sub? Yea university could seen coming. ""The MEDIA"" watched FOXNEWS, meanwhile viewership ones complaining ""the media"" enough. Foxnews viewers news outlet including broadcast channels. Tucker Carlson Sean Hannity promote proper precautions advocate vaccination.

It's **FOXNEWS** needs step change tune. get good ratings pushing snark/snide view COVID hoax. I’ve noticed husband too. He’s working way hours before, it’s really taking toll mental health. He’s working 8-5, takes break dinner, he’ll work 7-12 even later. feel bad him. It’s good idea use average like doing.

The death toll isn’t normal distribution, it’s right skewed.

The point California almost exactly median. 25th deaths per capita, that’s 34.2 deaths per 100k.

The average way, way higher Joining Spanish-speaking countries North South America. There's outbreak around Sunderland moment, 'happened weekend gone.

There conflicting stories around it, general consensus lad went holiday, think Greece way, came back infected. spread among football team, went lash around Sunderland. Pubs clubs choice close, least 30 people tested positive result many others waiting test results, school children/teachers also tested positive time seems connected; lad centre received death threats among things. Whether lad waiting test result went regardless, know, know English pubs lot old fellas ladies like pint risk people pubs time football team went in.

Sunderland probably need local lock down, even horse probably bolted lot people going here, everywhere realising infected close proximity people infected, indoors decent amount time.

It spread like wildfire short space time result one person picked abroad.

This one example get hand short space time result people. Grandma Grandad pub would still think same? protocol make sense, I’d say problem.

You think healthcare professionals wearing reason hundred years? wearing masks following restrictions

Indoors sure, outdoors mask usage around 70% lot block parties outdoor bars filled people wearing masks, addition people playing outdoor team sports without masks really striking quote:

“If you’re signing herd immunity, you’re also signing huge number hospitalizations, substantial fraction people sick months,” says Marm Kilpatrick, infectious-disease researcher UC Santa Cruz. “Do symptoms last three months? Six months? Three years? Nobody knows, wouldn’t want pandemic plan be, Let’s hundreds thousands young people lifelong illnesses. wouldn’t want tell 30-to-50-year-olds we’ve signed high risk heart disease chronic organ damage.” take 50,000UI week keeps normal range. Possibly. much pressure President (who possibly going door god willing) put company like Moderna release unproven vaccine. Plus...let’s honest...it company’s best interest long term release safe vaccine. don’t really want company known killing thousands unproven vaccine.

That said, pharmaceutical companies pressure EVERYONE get safe vaccine fast, again, it’s Trump thing. talking USA, it’s country get affordable firearms affordable healthcare. Reading comments feels like shit reading back may. I'm disgusted lack federal effort published here, since rather ""old"" article (from June) gain traction then. countries face challenges VitD3 much risk though, body produces tens thousands units sun bathe summer.

60,000 IU D3 several months causes hypervitaminosis negative symptoms.


The problem people take active form like one used study treat like random supplement instead storage form D3. context misread original post thought saying influenza covid equivalent?

When merely pointing complications unique observed viruses. 

Rather apologising resort xenophobic hurtful insults. Sweden actually par denmark Norway currently. also see operation warp speed inspire confidence. good news efficacy really high, say 90%+, trials may able end early. flip side, safety data may harder capture accelerated timeline since outcomes could rare and/or maybe long induction period. person better knowledge types long term adverse events see typical phase III vaccine trials could probably add here. Try reading comments attached paper mindlessly quote

That mindless quote, abstract.

And never read comments (which anyone write) bloody pre-print site.

You also completely ignoring fact steroids used cytokine storms decades. nothing new. confirmation (at least partially) useful case. nothing revolutionary. rest NYS, accounts 1/2 data, far 15-30% It’s ok. best muster *ad hominem* attack, I’m big enough take that. I’ll keep reading U.N. reports this. What’s believe? actual full mask mandate. cannot go ANYWHERE without mask. It’s suggestion courtesy like parts country. essentially can’t leave house without mask you’ll denied entry anywhere you’d try go. 

Our re-opening also phased technically speaking still isn’t even done NYC still indoor dining stuff like concerts/clubs/etc still aren’t allowed statewide doubt anytime soon. choice virtual learning strict policies want attempt in-person learning, grade schools colleges. Yeah using helps. Today 12hour sudaphedren day though. there's sharp pain behind eyes get down, shake head, etc. 

When covid panic dies doctors offices become less hassle going see ENT make map sinuses see I'm candidate surgery. article good. read still confused went flames face burnt. washing whole body hand sanitizer something?

Why hands catch fire. confused. propose better idea ford done schools?

Just curious. dont believe anything ideology dude. protests filled young healthy people (a lot masks) outdoors. proof protests caused spike besides ""common sense""? supposed feel way 6 million confirmed covid cases US?

Your numbers wrong. First off, 25 million (27 million today) total cases worldwide. children. MIS-C disease children 21 years age definition disease average age onset 8. Children account 2.1-7.8% cases globally. Second off, 662 number number cases 39 observational studies included paper, total number cases worldwide. 792 confirmed cases US alone. lot 1 100,000 shot. composite two journal articles.

Stop wearing masks don’t work anyway, move along. Single vitamin tablet mean anything. vary massively terms dosage. feel you. slept couch day. Feet got sunburn slipped blanket. pleasant.

*The purpose mass testing find whether regular teaching university increases spread infection.*

Nobody making claims whole Sweden it. **Nothing topic relevant US. Nothing article mentioned US.** reckless stupidity. literally makes zero sense plan keeping numbers down? politicians policy makers never actually went school? plans rely simple idiotic premise kids 5-22 going compliant social distancing, mask wearing, good hygiene? one whose high school experience defined promiscuous sex, smoking weed 5-10 people circle, beer pong, sports, sitting cars couches cramped kids, etc?

Statistically insignificant...

...and text reads like miracle Facebook cure. might enough, safe dose large individual variability need much 10000IU. test blood levels months taking it, thats way know. good target 40ng/ml. nurces pieces shit. would sad got COVID died. Safety assessed 28 days vaccination

You use word long-term, think know means. Ok buddy, sure you’re Democrat.  Damn took 50,000 IU pill every day two months. But, Vitamin also low might well Glass Bones guy Spongebob question trusting effectiveness vaccine - fact vaccine work proportion population. people (some know are) told personal ""choice"" isolate virus circulates numbers large 

Why put ""choice"" quotation marks? choice way taking vaccine choice. 

If *feel* vaccine effective you, choice either self isolate rejoin society. vaccine ever perfect, even 99% effectiveness, 1 100 people still catch COVID.

If start jumping rabbit hole ""one case (not death, case) one many"", end this. Remember original purpose flatten curve spread infections time, eliminate disease. White privilege scary thread. Seriously desire live alone world. Enough mutations keep rolling around world ad infinitum. mutation, generates zombies? Take magnesium along it. work together -emia means presence blood Well, there's headline expect... I’m even saying wouldn’t take - haven’t refused one yet. given speed incentives government get take it, think skepticism warranted - especially given short study horizon identify potential side effects. get younger population, less tourism, less testing. Agreed would likely affect numbers.

Is also possible population Africa spending larger percentage time outside? Fresh Air vitamin D? 

I know Africa giant land mass hard generalize.  is! It’s wonderful place. wasn’t democrat, wouldn’t able vote local elections. want vote. go outside? Touch doorknobs? *breathe*?

Even literally went party went home, adding another body increased spread within party means people bring home. sound pretty pathetic, maybe *those* people functional adults social lives. indirectly contributed *their* virus spread well.

There possible logical way say ""I want party pandemic"" doesnt make asshole. stop. Nevermind, edited post. English native langage :&lt; take shots means start normal life again.

Jury still risk it’s 50%, 50% effective (still lower end) means 50% less people infected, 50% less people spreading, theoretically 50% less people dying (gray area here, depends risk). R number cut half. I’d say that’s puts us pretty solid place. saying, comes D, everyone could use little more?

That's Mom says time.

GOTTEM true. NY. rich must taxed money must used benefit greater good. think argument is? I’m gathering. skin game. Data tells us clearly covid isn’t. NY didn’t significant growth protests. invited work-related/paid dinner last weekend, fancy restaurant sitting outdoors. nearby town higher population higher covid number. invite list 8 people. 1 declined.

The actual RDI around 7000-8000 IU per day. 

You Google Great Vitamin Mistake- IIRC name NIH article. Bz eye protection difficult get enough vitamin food, really best source sunlight. Even foods relatively high vitamin eaten large amounts get recommended dose. example, here's much foods would need meet 600 IU (some studies suggest much 4000 IU needed):

- 11 pounds salmon “As matter fact, texted transplant anesthesiologist come intubate me, did.”

I’m one bad people, guess. I’ve realized year family toxic me. realized lot pain self hatred felt years put them. realized months ago grandmother went visit aunt mom mentioned brother buying house. aunt grandmother laughed said that’s impossible could never afford home. brother firefighter. It’s like they’re constantly belittling family hate dad. don’t want see us well, includes 81 year old manipulative grandmother. don’t talk anymore. talk immediate family, love them, extended. Life short get caught mess! Plus, want happier ever were. use ""average"" way? World data incomplete, difficult really compare level. mean, American wouldn’t take vaccine even immediately election. wouldn’t risk it. Donald Trump tried hard pretend virus doesn’t exist, I’m sure he’d love away untested vaccine pushed election.

But vaccines start getting approved countries US election, would confident.

Really, trust government’s drug administrations. country sane leader measured approach, approval vaccine probably means it’s good go. country sane leader, wait countries also approve vaccine(s) country gone with. sun RDA wrong due statistical role vitamin innate adaptive immunity critical. statistical error estimation recommended dietary allowance (RDA) vitamin recently discovered; correct analysis data used Institute Medicine, found 8895 IU/d needed 97.5% individuals achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed 6201 IU/d needed achieve 75 nmol/L 9122 IU/d needed reach 100  Looks like another case really let natural selection it’s thing often, dumb fucks drinking bleach. Please let em? We’d better considered one mild cases since patient die? making pretty bold assertions providing sources, that's problem.

Without source, ""keto diet cures autism"" sounds ridiculous ""vaccines cause autism"" ❤️ NY, home state  Could singing spread normal flu? Get blood values tested Vitamin D. tests cheap, probably $10 something. stand statement many people compared bare shelves, rationing closed businesses communism similar pictures communist countries right collapsed revolutions.  right questions imo ... far, haven’t found answers. you? 

As vaccine - fast track lot it. can’t fast track finding long-term effects (you never reach long term conclusions short term data). However long vaccine tested humans (and tracked, phase 3) limit knowledge.

We won’t know 4 months, 1 year, 20 years. increase likelihood Guillain-Barré Syndrome (swine flu vaccine)? intussusception infants (rotashield vaccine)? examples confirmed CDC website, btw, I’m anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorist. vaccine winds using new MRNA tech rather traditional vaccine techniques, unknowns significantly greater. 

There *many* horrific consequences vaccines drugs (I include higher risk group using brand new vaccine tech higher risk tried-and-true tech) discovered confirmed years. 

I’m saying get it, none things mentioned 

- spend money resources quickly enroll lots volunteers
- manufacture vaccines loss hopes passes 
- run multiple trials once
- deliberately target hot spots 

can way address issue: effects, any, cause 6 months out? year out? 6 years?

I hope get vaccine soon, think it’s important understand risk involved. I’m sure many people nonetheless better vaccine sooner rather later. Eh, pretty average Europe. feel you. got dumped right started. couped nothing think failed relationship fucking worst thing I've ever gone through. truly felt like endure times. 
Hope things look soon. due parody account?

Are blinded politics think phrase ""left"" I'm referring political left? 

I elaborate though, shift left means take responsibility put hands someone terms food chain. nothing politics. Yeah mean today announcement increasing number cases people hearing following guidelines chilling even wear face shield protect craziness assumption ""more deadly viruses burn out"" false notion. SARS contagious incubation period incubation period shorter gave officials better chance eventually getting hold things. lucky Covid nearly lethal sars was, death rate would little impact spreads. ""Killing host win virus"" well neither immune systems defeating yet still spreads ease, whether kills host doesnt really matter, long ability spread new hosts long enough incubation period. Covid incubation period average 5 6 days. much longer incubation period influenza 1 - 2 days. mutations much unpredictable really idea make things better, worse effect all. That’s pathetic. Everything disappointing lately. COVID-MARTHA *Take damn gummy vitamins!* might look honestly. unhealthy neighbours Australian problem. Remind me! Two months Religion what? I'm assuming meant indoctrination... Indoctrination name game. view world indoctrination. intricate set programming. I'm trying say churches indoctrination, point diverse indoctrination best. Diversity ideas. NYC nearly everyone wearing mask. Even subway crowded streets. city recovering lot, mainly thanks majority following guidelines. diets probably cause concern well. tried exercising today felt mentally. Like huge fog. like feeling disassociation kind scared honestly. I’ll try 15 minutes day see goes. sure what’s wrong.  see US capitalism gamble feel normal circumstances celebrations national parks would due heat wave, red flag warnings fires, due covid precaution thrown wind.

Theme parks Orlando getting filled every day. people coming country flying home. tried therapy? 56 cases, 56 showing symptoms? right wing incompetent corrupt government USA ever had...

""This due leftists""

Are parody account? Half toxicity half benefit💪🏽 joke.. we've obviously exposed different pictures/media. seen tons people either wearing masks improperly. People ICUs, feels like going quite fast. insight this? Interesting - preventing hospitals overwhelmed absolutely message beginning lockdowns. 

No one talked eliminating cases waiting vaccine much later. Probably eliminating cases virus insane goal - still literally cases black plague, eliminating virus, especially often asymptomatic one, close impossible. Meanwhile waiting properly tested vaccine would least year, one would agreed to. 

There massive shifting goalposts I’m following one closely, husband used annual camping trip near Millinocket it’s crazy see news hearing reminisce stories years. locals actually know couple got married? I’m curious they’re treated. It’s tough area pretty much untouched disease life usual, real reason think wedding would turn hot spot. woke virus bro. believe ""right"" thing immune! People afraid move drop bears. feel fortunate lockdown. mental health drastically improved go work 5 months. pandemic hit working would great new company... I'm sure start another year half Hey everybody, get load fucking idiot. call bullshit. live NC. sudden spike halfway June, 2 weeks protests started. People wearing masks downtown Wilmington protests. Matter fact, didn’t start seeing masks worn everyone August. Okay here's couple caveats:

1. small sample size. 50 patients total. Easily small enough throw significance scientific standpoint, though certainly warrants study.
2. study may show processed vit plays role preventing severity, every single patient also given sub's favorite red headed stepchild, HCQ. also given azithromycin , though suspect there's little reason think could taint results.

My concern form takes produce body, infected, may produce much despite OTC supplementation, making self-treatment impossible. also wonder still giving people HCQ supposedly anything. wonder maybe combination key, again, would make self-treatment impossible. anyone studying redheads Covid-19? Considering make vitamin little sunlight needed? One niggle: “physical education” might misinterpreted athletics (swe: gymnastik). Perhaps better “in-person education”. 

Keep good work!  Cuz agree eyes objective truth everyone agree say so. I'm sorry qualifications supersede doctors? fellow intellectual. Joe rogan called first  red flag study authors say open label (meaning participants treatment teams know getting drug not) sentence say double masked/blinded says neither participant treatment team know treatment given. Huge red flag - clarified elsewhere manuscript. could bias taking intervention arm patients ICU taking control arm patients ICU.


The small sample size also concern. Further, continued use debunked HCQ azithromycin use steroids. 


This going turn another HCQ discussion fear, we’ll waste patient lives/time $$$ finally debunk it.


Or maybe (hopefully) I’m wrong confirmed larger rigorous trials.



Practically speaking mostly harmless give several doses vitamin sick patients shouldn’t encouraged. started comment well suggesting moderation rational thinking.

You finished comment unsubstantiated conspiracy theories quack medical websites.

No don’t necessarily need crazy amounts vitamin D. That’s whole point. take correct amount. 

How know correct amount? get levels tested. take 1000 IU day. retest levels. 

If can’t proactive, take 1000 day you’re probably fine. Don’t go start taking 10,000 / 20,000 website told used sun day.  also used die age 28 back then. Read making knee jerk reaction reply.

It seems like operating assumptions bad experiences opinion.

I ask, complete lack faith teachers?

Instead treating teachers like bad guys, maybe look ways support see actually like them?
Or inconvenience opinion much?

That said, like profession world, take advantage times like terrible profession.

Your solution modified evaluation structure great theory never happen. funding actually someone (who likely never classroom) write arbitrary bullshit evaluate teachers by.

No matter educators do, children going suffer one form another whether academically, socially, physically regardless pandemic. pandemic sure amplifies brings light myriad problems though.

There lot wrong U.S. education system generally fault teachers. completely isolated June PA. constantly reading sub studies COVID-19 sub, felt comfortable low risk outdoor transmission started adjust behavior calculated risk assessment. watch county's daily numbers dashboard remained relatively low steady summer. Mental health became factor needed considered well. seven year old child seen friend months, started letting play neighbors. started seeing risk parents, they're completely alone. strict, ""no indoors"" rule. gone eat handful times research showed outdoor dining also low risk two months outdoor dining county, outbreak tied it. chose homeschool daughter instead person option offered school lack air circulation. sign daughter soccer hosted small outdoor gatherings. 

While may look like ""virus fatigue"" some, calculated intentional risk assessment. know warm weather allows us take part activities fleeting trying take advantage mental health likely go strict lockdown winter. make excess million annually. shown outdoor gatherings, thereby protests (whether anti-maskers BLMers), massively contribute virus spread. guess people stay outside go enclosed spaces like homes bars party, unlike things like Sturgis event, long weekends. woke virus. Sorry, left joke without explantion. Thank much keeping info clarified good work around here. really possible current situation things change day day. teachers forced quarantine 14 days time, others get sick. classes remote, others hybrid model, change time. 
I saying good teaching occur year, rest teachers' shoulders, need added stress pressure top already dealing year.
Obviously bad ones still fired egregious problems, evaluation system meant deal with. duuuuuuuhhhhh Joe Rogen saying months. since whole thing started. perhaps dumbest thing I've ever read Reddit... saying something. Meth one last drugs wanna global pandemic lol. paranoia would strong lol. remember pusher said drinking bleach could also work....healthy scepticism okay. 

Reasons would include trump’s promise vaccine within next months. caused medical professionals worry administration dangerously speeding normal timeline developing testing vaccine effort win voters.  No, doesn’t happen Covid significantly contagious flu. Unbelievable people still using talking points even Fox News abandones months ago. Vitamin acts steroid body would align studies showing beneficial effect steroids treating Covid  Doesn’t get reported it’s overhyped tool used invoke fear. I’m anti-BLM come, protestors outdoors wearing masks. People need smarter social activities taking 2000iu daily via multivitamin year got levels tested still deficient. Could poor quality multivitamin people’s bodies process vitamin differently. Anyways stepped 4K I’m still alive there’s that. Lol Personally don’t think so. issues early able really enjoy it. legit copy read footnotes translator explains lot historical stuff briefly. Even without footnotes think you’ll ok. 

A lot first half book fiction set real world Chinese history. story really takes second half don’t need knowledge Chinese history enjoy it. It’s understanding obviously add layers social commentary think pick end even without ore existing knowledge. first? less quality endless ""must save lives cost"" spam goes around sub? despite leadership that’s similar US

This something Australian progressives say spend much time reddit.

The worst performer Australia Victoria, led left wing Labor government. left wing unsupervised temporary migrant private security guards given diversity &amp; inclusion training zero PPE health training.

Victoria underdeveloped public health infrastructure, late testing results contract tracing, comparison New South Wales, led Liberal government best testing, contract tracing public health infrastructure country COVID-19-wise.

So mostly commonwealth states needed i.e. federalism + lot luck. lot anti-makers there.

There handful anti-makers, anti-*maskers* common, especially rural areas. 5 months ago thought CDC shit &amp; feel CDC still shit.

One us hypocrite it’s me. I'm counting blessings I'm least able ""wait."" cousin getting married October venue wanted charge $4k move date new 2021 prices. got lawyer got $3k $10k already put it. whole process right may never big party.

They lining doctor like people waiting iPhones Black Friday sales. hear work due shutdowns anyway. Surely spend days camped out.. lie repeated thousand times truth. nazis like kind propaganda. 

Wait!!!!! WTF? talking BLM protests, shown significant caused spread people wore masks. Honestly, media largely done piss poor job communicating vaccines progressing quickly. Trump blather wants vaccines, end authorization them...I guess issue EUA manufacturers say aren’t ready aren’t ready. Operation Warp Speed pour money candidates.

The MEDIA needs communicate THIS! step 1: leave cess pool website right go. Unfortunately targeting children cause ant-vaxer backlash... rolled like flu vaccine. 

We need ""extra"" conspiracy theories, exactly would happen try put focus children. 

It's cookie jar effect. try push it... want it... ignore them, think they're missing something. trying again, hopefully way offend ensor-cay ot-bay:

interesting distinctions. (though ""azure"" ""crimson,"" wonder referring current polling data, states voted 2016. assume former, since 2016 race decided brooks ""toss-ups""; state definitively went either ""cerulean"" ""scarlet"".)

So 17 listed, included two ""sapphire"" states (DE IL), three toss-up states (MI, MN WI), 12 ""ruby"".

Of course, numerous well-populated states colors, list recent terms, they're slanting downwards peaking like July. Thinking Texas, plus CA, FL GA here.

It's perhaps worth noting states peaked early, say April, since stayed flat -- NJ, NY, PA highly-encouraging model set -- ""robin's egg"" One campus already shutdown. least happen Agreed. Way better vaccinate younger people, much mobile meet many people average elder meets couple. Plus, vaccine would probably effective younger people hence making stronger impact spread. Vaccinate health police workers first, younger. Cuz bats hate sun Individualism best worst quality. vaccine save lives. easy that. 

If someone want take vaccine, cares die? 

If someone takes vaccine trust effectiveness, choose self-isolate better vaccine comes risk there.

All personal choices valid. ignore one oldest universities country students parts country come study here. 

And purpose study say something prevalence virus Sweden, evaluate spread university/campus settings evaluate work environment risks staff students. Spent month Vermont Maine. def recommend escaping pandemic there. trashy news reporting trashy people living trashy life style. ridiculous. actual infection rate highest since April, mostly due localized outbreaks areas missed initial wave. Yes, infection rate fluctuate lot cases low, continuously citing percent positive infection rate disingenuous best.

And unless live yuppie/hipster areas, NY's mask compliance WAY exaggerated. I'm masks, acting like Covid kryptonite argument persuasive. Unfortunately probably matches statement above, increase cases negatively correlated percentage population participating protests. 

States northeast likely larger participation rate North Carolina, surely higher mask compliance. Litterally today revealed FHM passive aggressivly attacked *another Swedish authority* (the authority catastrophy risk management) painting ""nightmare senario"".

I’ve grinning bearing still don’t feel comfortable all!! US. CBS News poll published Sunday showed 21 percent voters U.S. would get vaccine soon possible free, 32 percent late July. majority, 58 percent, would ""consider it, wait see happens,"" 51 percent July. 21 percent said would never get vaccinated, 17 percent July. poll, conducted YouGov September 2 4, involved 2,493 registered voters.

So 21% would get 58% considering get it. first thought would coronavirus vaccine announced year, 35 percent said would think scientific achievement find vaccine fast, 65 percent would think probably rushed without enough testing.

So basically hesitating due think rushed enough test results yet. Understandable imo. 


21% get it.  David Salmon, director Institute Vaccine Safety Bloomberg School Public Health Johns Hopkins University, told USA Today: ""You probably need 70 80 percent population get immune order really control COVID.""

Once test results comes, people say get it. 21% plus possible 58% add got sick immune, enough people would get vaccinted. Actually fast June July. still new admission week disease quite long treatment ICU difficult go lower opinion. Since week 28 10-14 patients admitted weekly ICU week 33. Week 34 35 7 new admissions each. might possible drop 10 ICU patients, admissions stay level, unlikely drop that. Dumb question: ergocalciferol work lack general Vitamin D? Many would choose get vaccinated point time due vaccines particular strain rushed properly tested. lot talk ""fast tracking"" vaccines across world, means would undergoing rigorous testing needed vet efficacy said vaccines.

And last checked (which admittedly days ago), vaccines trials 50% effective, good percentage people would like vet on. 50/50 great numbers game.

Testing seems like enough go get single monthly dose 100k ius compounding pharmacy. happens, unprotected segment population vulnerable pandemic exponential growth (but declining rate transmission) around 75% population immune, virus run new hosts infect decline fairly rapidly.

The realpolitik solution easy:

If there's universal advice people struggling mental health issues, 'go therapist'. Noone struggle alone.

So contradiction accepting older vaccines everyone takes, yet skeptical vaccine that's put announced election. Income pedant? study reducing severity avoid dying says nothing stopping people getting COVID .

I would love see much smaller class sizes. would possible teach socially distance. would obvious solution. However, people don’t want pay it, even could come teachers. I'm sure google works well me. everyone pretending like can't catch family friends.

This case US too... breaking specific subreddit rules? It’s American assume pill vitamin fix everything. popular days “balance vitamins everyone deficient”. strong tinges that. Wow, popped candids (of facilities) could pretty interesting... agree. Stop religious brainwashing kids. Amazing.

I'm personally planning socializing NYC next 8 weeks expectation lockdown winter.  I'm hoping much case surge like March/April I'm going take reasonable precautions. Anyone checked border-crossings last week? 3 questions,

What do?

What know evaluation process?

If anything, would adapt modify process respect teachers adapt modify teaching? Pharisees smh head Well, yeah. comment somewhat, ahem, *rhetorical*. google actual sites show progress need fallow say takes 10-15 years. I'm randomly tossing numbers. 50 total 110 mink farms infections Netherlands, staggering numbers really. Politicians calling scrutiny infections deliberate collect reimbursement fee. May grand culling begin! Damn, think schools opened up? Lmao, 3 weeks? work healthcare, literally see COVID positive patients wearing mask almost 6 months now. wash weekends. Guess scars [Tuskegee white doctors injected Syphilis African-Americans still linger on. spelling mistakes good indicator. **Every phone** internet browser red line misspelled words.

No don't. It’s really problematic. fucking pilot study. placebo, blinding, under-powered.

It’s enough say fund proper study. It’s absolutely enough say treating regimen. That’s exactly happened HCQ, look much time resources waisted, mention patients harmed ignoring importance evidence-based medicine. clinical trialist US tell make ZERO conclusions paper, yet sub flipping dicks it. think people gone mad. nowhere strict countries. could leave house time destination reason. Well, pretty fucking safe Boris, least. far know, can’t catch Coronavirus twice, right?

These kids though, yikes basically Godzilla versus Megalon situation? Fuck kids.  Vaccine trials prolonged decade wait see turns up.

This factually incorrect, consider putting world without understanding you’re saying fuel skepticism indirectly lead unnecessary deaths. I’m one year CA. still don’t work union admin go. wonder could anything constant NYT notifications get saying vaccine bad dangerous. major news outlets start pushing idea vaccines dangerous people get scared. honestly don’t think lot people want find solution problem. It’s sad. Sturgis. Can't make shit up. blind hate cuomo dumb. may messed beginning, later decisions keep new york much worse situation. made bad decisions beginning mean contribute new york's current covid numbers. Great news... please screw supply cholesterol meds checked worldometer France. repeat first wave, would already seen surge deaths. Something different: either case numbers larger fraction total infections, virus less deadly, profile infected population same. Please keep discussion civil topic.  Nick Cordero died it, 41 Broadway performer. far tell known pre-existing conditions Sure let’s ignore fact yesterday fewest number new cases since June 21st. anyone says Sunday fewer cases Sundays July August Sunday still less ones months eBay? one, come places (such worst-hit areas Lombardy) serological studies showed 50-70 % population infected, herd immunity supposedly reached 20-25 %? 

On top that, interview made July cases down, might explain infections rise Europe, especially country highest infection ratio - Spain. badass. So, experts still unsure, recommendations(like distance masks) still there?  bet 3 million Americans die year. moving around school, lessons form “bubbles” whatever buzzword is. FWIW things useless lot instruments, flutes etc. makes sense think it. I’d go beach, everywhere crowded infections rare heard much look parties infections spread fast hell. 

This I’m glad I’ve got good tan :) go house. makes think person properly mitigates quarantines entirely bedroom like LOFL, what?! exercise outside, swim outside, eat outside, social distance visit meaning 6 plus feet, masks etc outside. I’ve seen family plenty since March driveway visits safe distance backyard dinners eat inside eat deck talk via screen door distance, hang outside large outdoor backyard. ways; people want stubborn throw huge hissy fits like “wahhhhh, want eat INSIDE restaurant, Daddy!” Grow up. Order carry eat outside safer distance friends family. one saying “stay inside,” zero human contact unless that’s something person decides want immunocompromised/health issues make choice protect themselves. 

Clearly creativity enjoying new normal coming innovative ways follow proper PPE, social distance mitigation efforts lacking end shows laziness globe mocking Americans for. It’s called mentally tough, creative adapting. Again, life carry without dick COVID adjusting new normal. reason hasn’t gone away gotten control weak minded people like yourself. everyone like me, we’d gotten back school without stress, able restaurants, gyms bars open PROBLEM. 

In end doesn’t matter say ultimately proof numbers. think experts like Dr. Fauci, CDC bluffing say fall winter worse record? Yea, ok. want kill people COVID go it, empathetic, descent human doesn’t want conscious. Also, please start reading systematic peer reviewed research journals—the EARLY studies coming show majority survived Covid (even asymptomatic) heart lung damage likely last lifetime regardless age. Measles caused sterility men, polio caused paralysis....do really think serious COVID won’t leave lasting impact?! Get program! sure feel (I family there) bear mind Massachusetts probably top five states ***currently*** terms handle this.

Yes, it’s in-person. participants (staff, teachers, students) required get flu shots. 

We shall see, guess. Vitamin affects immune systems, virus school district kids put cloth covers instruments, like masks instruments basically.

Indian Pharmaceutical company mass producing world's supply moment?

There clarity Indian Government no.of doses going procure also plan produce additional Indian Citizens. post nothing USA. DONT BRING USA!
Can talk India? big oof drop friends decide spend rest life isolation? So, looks like extrapolated estimate based total number cases. problem is, NYC hit epicenter status rest state...didn't. So, accept 20% state infection rate 30% city infection rate, NYC 63% cases 40% population. Extrapolating going give pretty skewed result.

Just look data per county basis- see majority cases handful counties around NYC. Half counties NY even hit 1000 NYC pulling average state. possible NYC hit 20-30% citing needed herd immunity, upstate definitely hasn't. yet we're seeing low positive test rates state wide. tried nothing ideas. attending church since 2007. Due pastor’s comments several friends church, leaving. lives matter...except wear mask.

Live life. wave could wash us away tomorrow. got moment guranteed. Umeå region low deathrate infectionrate satisfied hydroxychloroquine? /s was! believe institution marriage, done necessity.

I wish could without need sort legal recognition relationship, that's world live in: unavoidable issues like taxes death.

To give context: met Reddit. Finnish, time, gotten long-distance relationship, talking friends year even got romantic. (is) best friend.

Over time feelings developed decided see make things work, started traveling see each-other.

We traveled back forth several times, taking advantage 3 month travel visas, finding work would accommodate travel. end day, however, ticking clock relationship. time crossed border, risked visa rejected, started getting point border guards would restrict travel (you can't spend half year foreign country several tourist visas)

Basically, wanted future together get married.

Foreign people can't stay permanently love someone - married visa process (K1 visa) bullshit. everything right, span 2 years finally managed get everything together approved, even still border guards continued harass us (making wife cry interrogation), paying thousands dollars process applications.

Either way, approved, 90 days entry US get married, else she'd never allowed back. (unfortunately) work required travel, wedding day landing US lived (Massachusetts) driving closest state same-day marriage license, got married park judge called day before. drove home together first time,I dropped off, went work.

Edit: I'd like clarify original content ""weddings bullshit"" context kinds weddings we're discussing thread. Weddings (the event itself) marriage (the symbolic joining families) two different things, referring weddings bullshit, mean marriages (though personally feel necessary government officiate relationships) - specifically talking events gather people together basically stand around burn money heavily inflated party. Nah dystopian think virus mostly human threat. extremely rare animal outliers exception, reproduces bodies spread it. behaved intelligently compassionately could defeat virus weeks, years. AcTualLy Eh, that's vaccines work. get eliminated body fairly quickly. especially true two coronavirus frontrunners based mRNA. mRNA breaks body time. actually serious problem delivering vaccines break vials refrigerated really low temps.

Generally safety issues, show Phase 1-3 trials. [The problem Dengvaxia, example, showed Phase 3 However got approved Philippines anyway.

To extent problems take years surface, they're rare get signal millions vaccinated. point, I'd say risk getting serious case virus current pandemic much higher. mean sincerity somebody understands life death.

There restaurants. Yeah probably right. even know want things go back 'normal'. hold hope things get better either. Listen jack tk supreme leader spread bullshit social media. We've seen pictures We've heard stories. Anyone acts like really believe Jesus. feel church makes better everyone else, attend first place. Rural NY Red-voting county checking here. It’s rural VAST majority people wearing masks grocery shopping day day errands.

Can’t tell it’s like bars / restaurants hipster family aren’t using them.

But mask compliance way exaggerated. packed almost two months now. Please point dead dying started visit Disney. That's also possible seen reports lasting health conditions people every Age? reinfected covid? Small towns Southern half need quit gathering groups, quit going shopping big crowds entertainment purposes, learn words social distancing mean, stop thinking mask chin warmer. big part population density. larger cities provinces, covid hit harder. someone Saskatchewan, population million, effect us much. reason Canada able survive CERB, program gives money affected covid scientists can’t figure out, don’t ask redditors sub? Lots explanations here. Honest lying. must truth! hope every single one comes bad case Covid. Maybe finally clue reality. would really expect do? Enjoy bedroom. ""Those cannot learn history doomed repeat it."" Mental health need better addressed country sure. Please consider speaking professional. Many telehealth options available days. Stay safe! Yep, basically happened NJ summer. numbers mostly flat ups downs there, pretty much clusters related indoor parties/gatherings. Governor basically drilled outdoors safer indoors again.... meaningful spread per state epidemiologists linked outdoor dining, beaches (meaning beach parties shore), etc. even freakin Great Adventure open summer. 

I sure outliers (like entire pandemic), want go something, safer bet keep outdoors. wrong also exactly scotsman argument

the books people claim follow explicitly decry hatred dehumanization say embrace humility love compassion

but adherents often dont things, squeaky wheels fuck cabbage cart send wrong direction 

there plenty religious people behave way. entire churches sects religions, actually. look Episcopal church, they're openly welcoming LGBTQ+ often seen standing BLM. 

On balance, *most* religious people like I, trying right others drawing available sources help define moral code. 

So no, logical fallacy. 

Shitty religious people shitty. shitty people religious, can't even properly argue ""most"" religious people shitty. religions operate power structures engrained rhetoric. top 1%, usual, dictate course group whole, Catholic Protestant family street you.

Not want reread without internet connection access changes.

I’ve got Refworks keep track citations, don’t need advice track references.

If you’ve come source shows viruses delayed masks stopped, would love read it. sure you’re going “she didn’t die covid, died covid” angle here?  Gotta careful comment.....uummm..... Sorry folly contribute go ”lets stay home weeks hospitals prepare” ”its causing permanent lung, heart testicular damages. I’m leaving house vaccine!!”? first emphasize classical formula, 1-(1/R0), remains applicable describe herd immunity thresholds random vaccination, immunity induced infection naturally selective. think forcing lockdown requiring masks contributed covid numbers low right now? schools Ontario open week, I'm sure go perfectly cause uptick cases all, right? Poor joke Getting downvoted stating truth  needs push back this. boss taking advantage him. way taking work calls 6 am, around 7 pm. answered question multiple times. either failed read sources don’t accept them. clue viral transmission real science works. hope god you’re teacher, are, need stop wasting time Reddit take refresher courses ASAP. Yes I'm thinking individual timeframe. start feeling ill? Maybe symptoms? think skipping large portions process speed mean anything?

EDIT : clarity, go normal process would 100% first line vaccine. states, fuck that. political guinea pig. Haha welcome! dont know risk going french open two examples completely different. One unnecessary sporting event. essential get food live. personally would want go event like right now. reason risk it. blatant politicization CDC USA might something it, curiously r/nottheonion need spout Chinese propaganda. African Americans far likely vitamin deficient, melanin stops sun damage reduces ability skin make vitamin D.

Combined data, one could predict African Americans would greater risk ICU admission.

Which indeed showed mortality data start (23% deaths, recall).

Let's forget months ago told systemic racism (by AOC particular). could instead smart tell people make sure get enough sunlight supplement Vitamin D, esp dark skin. There’s social title I’d like die faster “influencer”. whole movement wannabe Kim Kardashians want famous famous one single shameful pieces human existence. Right willful obesity. already invested pre-owned scuba suit. Disney World, come! also asked followers home remedies could add list smoothies, herbal teas, vitamin tablets.

Ah yes. dead people think trying Go outside **modest** amount time every day, without sunscreen. getting little much sun, skin start produce additional melanin block it.

The amount varies person person based skin tone, human bodies literally evolved manage Vitamin levels without thought mathematical formula.

So really simple going outside bit, mention myriad health mental health benefits. I'm depressed fact life routine violently disrupted, I'm depressed fellow Americans stubborn stupid follow SIMPLE rules could saved end hundreds thousands people.

I'm depressed KNOW sunshine warm weather outside coming end, going get worse. much worse.  believe state manipulate data? Florida? one state state can. Oooo wait ur troll bad!! Carry lol Madeleine Edit. effective cohort much resilient vaccine side effects general. No, used car salesmen preferred. US that's insurance. charge insurance company.

If insurance, charge you. pay there. still summer 😂😂😂the weather May listened Rogan knew months ago...

What twisted world live newsworthy information passed podcast fear mongering news. anti-maskers say yes that. non-Americans would also point bill 6 months American hospital going ruin person's life much as, so, virus itself. Whenever doubt, cherchez la femme. “Beat husband? Bad, death” - Cuomo, probably wedding 65 guests, resulted secondary tertiary tiers infections making total known 147, three deaths people attend. 

I sorry everyone involved would interested see contact tracing map ultimately looks. might convince one two people avoid gatherings would worth it. said. Yet another instance lone scientist making unsubstantiated claim Schrodinger's virus. Meanwhile scientific community worldwide supporting development vaccines 'herd immunity' policy, go figure.

Love California supposedly reached hErD iMmUnItY 20% New York's deaths per million. risk chronic fatigue indefinite period time? I'll get shot take step torwards normal life sounds like good idea, deep breathing exercises go sleep. Good luck hope health continues improve. people ICU, small changes feel drastically could well statistical noise. common numbers go one due registration differences such. 200 people ICU make difference visible Amateurs. US gets many cases one minute. So, happy advice absolutely good?

I'll give advice good...

When giving advice consider everyone circumstances. 6th largest university Sweden, roughly 65% number students largest one (Stockholm university).

I guess chosen Umeå little spread compared rest Sweden, students country come back studies, could give good insight virus spreads.  50% effective vaccine reduces available population spread virus 50% assuming 100% compliance. plus mask use absolutely end pandemic. numbers game. enough people immune masked reduce spread, R0 drop unsustainable levels die off. Unlike flu, thing mutate enough yearly strains. Thus drop reproduction numbers low enough, resume life was. People claiming thread cancer usually good sign truth said. I'm asking provide data, refuse. owns successful clothing line, I’m sure led “influencer” shit!! much population get enough Vitamin sun. makes sad. honest, first thought was, ""not educated enough. instead opening more, could wait two weeks see results schools universities starting? Could... could please that? Maybe? might show patients get disproportionately affected. mention smokers already causing considerable damage lungs resulting increased complications respiratory diseases.  think lot it’s freaking crowded!! bad Spain, Italy, UK growing now... Keep civil, people. conversations without devolving personal insults. Good luck stay safe! People can’t infect fleeing states eat indoors walk street without worrying getting mugged hit stray gunfire Maybe calcium interaction?

I'm happy job least end year, feels like work did, money saved, invested myself...worthless. Like never happened. idea I'll ever able regain momentum. mention I'm Black like things fine fucking realm year. Honestly surprised jumped bridge something. deaths I've year COVID, COVID survivors killing themselves. horrible time alive. component may generic code database refer generically.

Hospitals strict protocols PPE good reason. Everything inspected checked ensure protects hospital staff patient. Although absolutely bullshit still surgical grade N95 shortage, ok allow hospital staff source PPE. 

You know source coming from, whether manufacturer verified, quality PPE par, etc; there's thousand different reasons hospitals let staff provide PPE unless catastrophic situation. didn’t fully answer question. didn’t define risk. risk catching Covid, risk many people catching Covid, risk death? different won’t specify mean. think chance Covid unacceptable risk, nothing debate. There’s going risk time leave home.

You say you’re one group putting another risk. type law enforcement protested qualifies group going beyond risk harm another eyes, appears think right protest murders isn’t valid fears Covid cases spiking. 

You’re one keeps asking impossible data shit show Covid response government. don’t enough tests test every single protester, states don’t even adequate contact tracers they’re testing now. work data we’re given, [that demand even evidence yet show anything supporting opinion. can’t support argument? article/survey post many public health departments said protesters appear contribute spikes cases. [Spending day beach also appears ) don’t know hard time believing outdoor spread low. Well, strike that, really think people infectious soon they’re infected virus “exponentially spread“ 6-10 feet rate faster recirculated air see you’d terrified gathering. That’s virus spreads, data suggests outside transmission rare, especially precautions taken. Lmao. Thanks throwing Sweden. Sweden far lower mortality per million Spain, UK, Italy, seeing resurgence cases. explain *that*? 

A study hardest hit towns Lombardy showed 50-60 %, cases 70 % population infected. Tell me, possible, infection suddenly dip 20-25 % population infected? Infections NY dipped anti-covid measures summer, Sweden rest Europe around locking summer. There's shouldn’t use herd immunity right since looks like we’ll probably good vaccine place end year. Oxford, Pfizer Moderna shots fall short, believe choice explore herd option point. next vaccine candidates won’t evaluation end Q1 2021 best, world cannot stay shut 2021. would utter insanity, pandemic ever handled societal-destructive way (except maybe Black Death, 30-60% IFR).

No, utter insanity would accepting millions deaths herd immunity would require. can’t trust anything coming US government. Thats point view take protect ourselves. part disputing? Huh wild ignorant. Everywhere else New York (outside city) indoor dining open. I’ve experience I’ve heard others, every precaution taken. People spend years getting business together closed ramification family years after. There’s reason indoor dining stay closed everything else including schools gyms reopened. OmG mean gone outside done healthy activities since pandemic started boost immune systems?

CrAzY Good point. Crunching numbers saying 1 100,000 shot different comparing Covid-19 deaths flu deaths back March numbers known said done. educated woman 60s, OMG WTF wrong young people days education wasted grow brain idiots. lots vaccines phase 3 trials. means data phases 1 2 show is, fact, effective level. Oh no!! influencer corona virus follow health guides! still don’t see person asked? Fuck yes new york Sounds expensive way things northeast general low numbers positives decent numbers testing, seems unlikely they'd need close on-campus spread, would influx cases surroundings too. three years estimate assumes:

 
1) None steps taken parallel

2) full, worldwide deployment vaccine stop virus sufficiently return things normal 


Both bad assumptions, precisely ""educated guess"" simply personal assessment definitely ""standard"" anywhere. Yes, people started 31/8, although first-year students started week earlier prep courses.

Worth noting much education still online, though. physical education *allowed* university, mainly first last years (and even many distance teaching). giving away vaccine countries free

you misspelled ""testing countries free"" Ppl try get normal way. spend time outside. Hiking, normal walking possible, maybe even use bike go work. latter, 30km/day perfect vit values last time got checked.

Supplements that. Supplement. Try get much normal means, supplement sufficient. bodies made take vit via nutrition place better?  make 5,000 capsules? taking 10k day one point remember taking 2 pills day Anyone else get confused would get shot first place? thought North Korea. OP meant say ""I confused political opinions facts.""

... Kind common occurrence America days. Even Fauci calling bluff vaccine: ""Dr. Fauci also indicated U.S. unlikely use Chinese Russian vaccine doubts testing know Texas issue governor tying hands local government. Labor Day weekend, city San Antonio closed public parks buildings, able do. Private businesses hopping! (Hospitals hopping!) continued mask use reach 70% inoculation achieve result. And? Fauci snake oil salesman. He's modern day Mengele. Sounds like alcoholic’s trick alcohol via enema (does thing: enters system faster). Also: recommended 😎 like we're swimming shark-infested water. Maybe investigated bona fide scientists instead politicized. agree. Denmark, Norway, Finland Island good beginning. Let's hope stay way! There's also option i'm experiencing...

Being relationship someone another country, allowed country, here.

I seen gf since 1st March now.

Feeling really fucking isolated, family left country...

Thankfully travel exception added 2 weeks ago couples, hopefully able come soon embassy accepts request travel permit.

But likely allowed country holidays...

Which mean i'll alone everyone else gets spend time families loved ones...

The panic attacks thinking havent fun. Let's take solace hope surprises, case. includes 5 schools [Gatineau across river Ottawa.  alcohol consumption probably tripled, count?  Tricky go outside lol, avoid ppl wear mask. months, also live densely populated area Partial herd immunity makes difference. Current guesses herd immunity tresholds seem around 30% (far 50-70% naive estimates given R0). HIT low, 10% 20% immunity quite close. Even disregarding treshold ""full"" herd immunity, 10-20% immunity always going give \*at least\* corresponding reduction R, reduction 0.1-0.2 case (and likely more).

This sub seems divided camps must push narrative immunity never ""help"" improvement region must people ""acting better"" ""learning lessons"". Reality bit obviously. 10-20% reduction R immunity 10-20% reduction whether people act like idiots not. people can't arsed take pill gummy everyday, ask doctor shots keep covered months. sorry experience that. sure it’d utterly infuriating! know several gossip blogs last several weeks posted anon sources saying Covid running everyone Hamptons (a lot influencers, public figures etc) want return NYC (that low positivity rate worked damn hard get there)! couldn’t deal outbreak “ew poor/middle class diseased people, thanks,” want return. It’s bullshit!  Vitamin supplements make depressed fuck. Go figure. I'll try get outside more.

(And yea know that's uncommon reaction....happens w/ supplements push depression: Fish Oil, B12, D3, D, etc)

Some people think professor fired spouting crap. 2% positivity rate tests cant really talk testing little. Denmark almost testingntoo much.

There's reason /r/COVID19 banned site tendency sensationalize titles point *inaccurate*. read article: -- repeat, -- evidence long-term clinically significant damage.

There paper one Nature family journals (maybe Nature med? I'll try find it) several years back showed similar (except worse) findings 6-month follow-up discharge hospital SARS patients; classic signs restrictive lung disease 2/2 viral pneumonia ARDS. signs normalized reasonably short order and, regular follow ups far 12 years (at point paper published), suffer long-term clinical dysfunction -- little since I've read it, recall correctly, one signs lung disease, actually *better* population whole age (leading one colleagues humorously remark data appeared suggest SARS *protective* lung disease).

On top that, frankly, I'd surprised *didn't* see significant recovery times sample 20% patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. That's going damage lungs pretty significantly well -- frankly, point, VAP straight-up trauma probably going one bigger concerns.

Finally, article says -- lot tissue damage *did show clinically*. is, degree tissue damage determined CT scans, actually impact patient -- lead abnormal oxygenation, arrhythmia, symptoms patient, pulmonary function testing, that. incidentally found follow-up precisely *looking* it. Again, that's unusual recovery courses pneumonia.

But that's beside point that, again, experience significantly severe coronavirus family members (namely, SARS) viral pneumonias (or pneumonias general) suggests likely normalize time. (As clearly already started to, 0 weeks, everyone would issues, 6 weeks, 12.)

I think invested education we’d get students information literate. However, would mean smaller class sizes, updated textbooks, teacher training (teachers never stop learning there’s always room improvement), updated schools (how learn classroom falling apart?), less state testing/no funding based testing (when funding based focus teaching test rather critical thinking). It’s going take lot changes, you’re right need say, “we going teach critical thinking!” also need teach digital literacy: assess resources validity, use technology create, responsible digital footprints, etc.

It would expensive time consuming that’s won’t done time soon, unfortunately. variables related seasons indoor activities vs outdoors/schools/holidays... direct correlation weather temperature outweighed entire year!

This year almost still see headlines like this?

America, get fucking shit together.

Sincerely, 

the rest developed world. experience all. I've seen:

Chinese people take seriously; mask wearing well 90%.

Educated, white professionals - pretty high mask usage, least indoors, high Chinese.

Immigrants/minorities - hit miss. Old Polish Italians can't bothered. Half latinos wear masks nose. goes half workers local supermarkets - including managers. care.

Also, subways/buses, I'd say 1/3 passengers mask up. take train late night nonwhite neighborhoods, masks anomaly.

There's zero enforcement rules anyone. think people power want country divided, then... sweet summer child.

- guy picks side 1
- guy B picks side 2
- govt made sides 1 + 2
- govt got ppl choose sides
- therefore: government's fault “Sixth largest country”. make seem like relevant world scale. largest university Sweden like midsize school USA. Sweden tiny country, Umea tiny town. (as Dutch Canadian) fell asleep Aruba beach 11 3pm ( drunk). like snake shedding skin day later. 5000 IU perfectly fine. Anything less 1000 might well taking anything agree almost everything, im happy didnt take opportunity ""show leadership"" though, true leadership accept dont know everything allow people know things take charge. dont think government scapegoat, would weirder swedish perspective sudden decided ignore experts. Needless say would say good 90% people area wearing masks

IIRC experts think 80% compliance enough make huge difference. 

Your story restaurant reminds society untested decades, challenge we're finding irrational seemingly smart people be. sympathy them, though - without government assistance crippling see life's work whither die.

Similar story lung damage pneumonia.

Its OK little buddy, admit wrong. safe space remember hard get acute toxicity, randomized trial found doses high thousands actually \*increased\* risk osteoporosis. equivalent ""though leaders"" corporate, white collar working world context. Also, many ""influencers"" make bank people heard about. make enough within niche. passive aggresive attack reply survey sent authorities MSB painting ""nightmare scenario"" authorities, regions political actors may start spreading misinformation scenarios developed experts used preparation guides.

So claiming unique issues related covid fearmongering lie. need daily.  Actually shelter place order state had. quite high compliance rate quite severe. things open 5-6 weeks grocery stores. 75% deaths nursing home residents governor filed EO requiring nursing homes take COVID suspect COVID +patients hospitals without allowing tested knowing lacked adequate PPE isolation solutions stop spread. Sorry dumb question: 

Looking different studies, recommended take vitamin pills everyone?

Also without knowing actual vitamin levels, would beneficial start taking counter vitamin supplements ones Costco? 6% everyone gets infected. current overall mortality rate absolutely astounding 1 1000 americans died covid far. number actually closer 1 500.

The 6% mortality rate among infected people. I've using generic Flonase already years (thanks Costco!).

lt looks like maybe March 2020 generic Dymista. so? know efficacy without continue monitor immunities? zero data duration point anything bit better taking placebo. ""at risk"" category, something better 50% needed govt fund true small business relief effort. less costly lives economic factors reopening. 80000 per week low. fair, precedent yet holiday weekends spread virus. Oh wait... Dunno, many countries pro hoax leaderships like US? think many don’t. tiny scale Sweden says something Sweden. looking something larger criticize unknown reason. believe influencer better described owner fashion clothing line marketing. Sweden hardly tests people that's uninformed people think ""low"" now. 

Sweden 80.000 tests per week. 
 
Denmark 246.000 tests per week. 

can't high weekly new sick people hardly test citizens *pats side head like USA does* point don’t even think single glove manufacturer United States horse bolted. new transmission new horse — testing, block future transmission. every future transmission future asymptomatic carrier blocked outset. Preventing future transmission less valuable can't prevent past transmission.  maintain masks social distancing keep transmission manageable levels addition testing, idea testing block transmission means less community transmission general, therefore need less distancing.

NYC schools offering online Hybrid (small callses days week). Right 40/60 % kids groups. Hard imagine giant outbreaks happening schools open. Daycares, day camps open Plus increases ethnic diversity/variations different geographical regions Different EMS systems different resources. lucky enough small group also super lucky someone department panic bought PPE Ebola scare years ago. consider 14 us getting sick luck point. You’re welcome. It’s called Dymista. Idk insurance always wants cover though. afford it, Flonase OTC. Get permission doc start ASAP. SSR? Sorry stupid question Netherlands, recommended dose still 400IU, 800IU 70, small dose. take 4000 since many years. Sweden shut everything down. got done with.
We keep prolonging masks social distancing. Yeah luckily men contend much higher mortality rate. Yes, worried, get second opinion feasible you. never good idea. Doctors wrong sometimes Looks like New England place right now. shit. what’s isn’t ravaging countries like everyone thought would. Yeah, sure feel worse ever right now. thought bad virus, whole new low me. What's wrong it?

If vaccinate imperfect efficiency (which expect) low uptake (which may able improve on) reduce opportunity virus transmitted significantly. However, go back February 2020 behavior, reduction may still enough prevent infected person infecting new person.

If happens, unprotected segment population vulnerable pandemic exponential growth (but declining rate transmission) around 75% population immune, virus run new hosts infect decline fairly rapidly. 

The gap proportion population protected, 75% threshold, could larger number people already infected. would even attribute rare side effect vaccine trials. Even US 20,000 people Oxford trials, 10,000 kids. one person developed narcolepsy would difficult say vaccine fo something else. fine. doc wants 5k caught July 4, took 2 months start showing symptoms..? Seems unlikely. would recommend trusting doctor without verification. I've doctors, always older white men, steer horribly wrong.  weirdly specific stat. judge deaths per capita? 

We know reason makes dumb ol' GA look worse. Yeah herd immunity. know herd immunity threshold really Wait till *he* gets disease, he'll change tune. show New York corrected this? claim, source exist. make harder virus grow exponentially. 

For every 5 people virus hops to, 1 immune. even difficult virus consider 20% infected generally 20% reckless social distancing. 

Again return 5 people comparison. Realistically every 5 people virus hops too, 1 already immune, 2-3 could wearing face masks washing hands probably least 1-2 failures infect. Leaves 2 potential victims original five. 

That's slowdown would mean virus. first 3 cases mistakes Bible people asked get herd immunity without waiting vaccine. 

There are, hand, virologists epidemiologists saying people get herd immunity without waiting vaccine. 

Perhaps studied religion making mind. 71% upvoted? Weird. Great point technical problem. leave room emotionally charged leadership decisions, yet driving much policies, people's choices, least US. Look New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, polar opposite Trump coming crisis flying colors.

Eh, lot success seems much luck ability population listen, rather PM top everything. border testing policies etc last weeks proven absolute joke unpreparedness.  62M actually infected (that’s 90% unreported), it’s still close number need herd immunity 325M people. needs 4x higher. would great rendered everyone sterile impotent. need population control. Lmao. Yes... China always tells truth. That's awful. I'm afraid may even worse Maine wedding... I’m taking pitch salt still think amount U-turns government done last month so, poorly Tory Party members viewing present, coupled everything else, would surprised step sometime next year.

Of course, think last straw time office would significant second wave autumn winter government able handle adequately again. way. I’ve literally never seen mink coat ever. even rich people. Nice links Dead people can't vote, care people die. it? mRNA vaccines. believe much rigid conditions required say seasonal flu vaccine. Thank insight!

It's really hard virus spread quickly there's many people type immunity. There's multiple urban areas across world we've seen this. might biggest question mark. catch shit already? *covid19 would like know location* Reddit always struggled downvote = disagree problem. don’t great solution, frequently stifle quality conversation. said it. would have. enough people listening. It’s pretty wild really, really get see selfishness really looks like. aren’t human, look “Lizard people” wish become learnt anti-China statement would ok? schools haven’t started yet, Ontario starts week example. What's difference ""specialist"" politician? Almost China took two rivals one fell swoop. lol clue. dive bar serves liquor nobody would ever order food opened month ago. can’t believe 1% past month sales via food. Trump listening to? limited testing capacity prioritizes testing severe symptoms young people exhibit severe symptoms, case count also appear low. However lie pretend he’s done great job. everyone around tells great job he’s doing. 

I honestly don’t even think knows badly he’s this. matter? single example point community managed allow significant spread covid younger population protecting senior population? question whether possible. I've job three weeks. new friends ED work six month old masks too. expect get new one anytime soon. Oh compliance pretty good. Good enough stringent measures needed. Check [reproductive rate (R) page 3. R bounced around bit measures introduced quickly settled 1 under. Hence reduction cases since late April. 
There recent versions document one shows activity spring much clearer.

Edit: added page number defer specialists times like these, Politicians.

Well, BC Canada, ""specialist"" going Federal Health Officer requiring masks schools. also says kids can't really transmit it. And...she also said 1 (3 feet) fine.

She also made commericial show schools would like fimed classroom. called sink 6 kids (not classes look like) replied, ""It never meant represent classroom.""

So messed up. point washing hands... said start. know, throughout modern times. Whatever French version Karen is, yah Yes is.

Also, places hit herd immunity (resistance?) others 20% scattered country concentrated certain areas. lunch tables allow students 6 feet apart. Sanitize way way out. 

Pretty much philosophy open restaurants. Olympics longer relevant. subreddit seriously deteriorated going unsubbing. Bye. Chesco here, yeah think state govt good job keep things control sad reality 100% believe Trump could know kill people wins election go it. pro-vaccine, pro-science, pro-learning, pro-listening-to-experts. also pro-trump-doesn't-give-a-fuck-about-anyone-but-himself. call paranoia like past results indicators future success, yea, Trump would absolutely kill people get elected. People vote assume headline lie. fuckwit fucking virus still thinks reopening everything way okay. Gods Conservative party full idiots.... work? need make certain percentage sales via food considered restaurant? I've heard really know anything business. little early expect much change. commercial real estate collapse Houston early 80s due overbuilding oil boom years. oil became cheap again, everything collapsed.

Buildings sat vacant partially-occupied, nothing much happened first. Eventually trickle-down effects banks much.

A lot buildings offer space bargain basement prices. New companies could never afforded nice digs moved in. Whole areas city changed. example, Vietnamese community mostly left run-down edges downtown took fancy new, inexpensive offices strip malls southeast side town. times got better, buildings old Vietnamese area torn new gentrified ones went up.

What determine way people jump time whether covid sticks around continues mutate, many companies make wfh permanent. think little early tell. old boomers, new. Done Easter^2022 thought first honestly people saying back may definitely bad people freaked about. Thanks input! school purchased masks clear windows front. also personally purchased voice amplifier. It’s microphone small speaker amplifies voice. help make voice louder I’m talking mask on. hope anyways. wrong. far lower 25% outside NYC metro area. think good deal people get anxiety thought wearing mask long duration, heightened anxiety leads conclusions. work athletes wearing mask outside turf 3 hours sucks gotta gotta do. classes going online tuition, think we've learned recognizable degree. Probably easy make connections network online.  Yeah, mine holding it. They’re trying ask information it’s handled, won’t make decision without informing everyone first. Yeah idea someone go hell boning gender puts huge asterisk whole ""all lives"" thing

Why put shame never there? 

Christianity taught homosexuality ""missing target"" two things: 

1: children needed make culture survive.

(&amp; 2: christianity literally spread converting women household let household converted influence.)

Btw. ""sin"" means; hit bullseye target. Eternal life eternal damnation equal parts cop-out cudgel. 

Uhm getting day work while. Like, ""don't drag people working cradle grave spare time"", know? keep going forward allow technology science figure way resurrect dead people. ask you. hear sorts religious folk supporting things like death penalty cause ""god sort out""

Uhm.... so-called americans talk days? about: ""{What smallest creations, unto me}"" ? talking rather short-lived concept infused christianity *Pope Gregory VII preached student Pope Urban II order fight muslims*, reason muslims tense christianity today. 

You seem mistake religion old world new world spiritualists, happen roots christian culture means, value earthly life. that's it. that's end result logic.

But again, infused christianity make people go kill muslims simultaneously trying teach ""{Thou May Kill}"". Think ""warlordism"". took entire continent dropping everything 2 months. would work again, course, think tool can't overused. Better try get things control local measures much possible nuclear option. really seems busy put with. recommend unsub here. need brace revolution depends mean herd immunity. New York reached enough immunity things could go back normal without cases rising? No. reached enough immunity cases largely peter continue current social distancing measures? certainly possible, yeah.

For instance, Arizona's peak spread late May, R0 estimated 1.25. Herd Immunity Threshold disease R0 1.25 20% (which New York City already exceeded based sero-surveys). words, New York City's population could operate similarly Arizona's spread peak, 1/5th 1/4 population immune, would case growth. 

So New York City reached herd immunity normal sense (where things go back normal), looking quite likely little spread level restrictions would cause widespread infections immunologically naive population. What's deal side effects keep talking about, though? Like would worse disease itself? ever thing vaccines?

My (non-biological) grandmother supported grandson's wife told want vaccinate first great-grandson ""because autism"". first time I'd ever heard (this knew ""autism"" supposedly thing had, lol.) even thought kinda stupid?

But Nana always told sister got vaccine diphtheria(?) days later, died it. 1925?

So made sense skeptical vaccines. apart story I've known whole life, can't think one adverse reaction vaccine worse thing supposed prevent.

I posted added minor political rant end, post got removed... instead I'm gonna end ""I got feelings skepticism vaccines precedent (this word typo) sets."" mum teacher hearing impaired given lack support kids get already masks create big problems. able produce 300 million doses (/2)per year sounds like fucking joke.

But hardly claim getting UK EU “life’s work” - admission - unsure side referendum campaign wrote two columns, announcing supporting leave remain respectively. getting us EU life’s work, surely wouldn’t that. 

This article video confirming wrote two articles (normally truster Huffington post video BBC, found article) ... Unless he’s case number 4. fresh air change scenery doubt helps mental health well. Article headline fake news 11,000 points. classes told stay home affected classes. school closed.

I dislike Johnson much next person, fake news fake news. rumours Conservative MPs said may leave office sometimes next year, even though recovered Covid-19 taken toll effected health they, he, thought would.

Hopefully Yes. he’s empirically correct. Every place reached estimated 20% infection seen dramatic slowdown soon think Americans, whole, mental fortitude go without bread circuses decent amount time. We've become weak people (maybe long time, opportunity really see it). still politics. Boris's people know spread. left placed strict rules shutting school one infection. right thing do? Probably opinion. also added benefit making Boris look bad.  students take masks eat, try eat outside much possible. wash hands/use sanitizer put masks back on. It’s bad. same. think store vaccines ? 

The storage temp normal   estimates 90% infections gone undetected People love thinking know better everyone else. Conspiracies knowing fixing anything, they're special feeling get see experts facts see things really are. 

This conspiracy theorists never fucking believe real conspiracies. they're real, *we* figure virtue fucking smart saw truth everyone else believes. Seems we've told opposite types people years. Get degree that's highly applicable wide range government jobs. I've steady job last 6 months. Even got 20% pay raise so. I've getting work home. ""sighs hard Alexa asks im ok"" bars near Florida went got food license. open around month. Yeah thankfully. referring mostly spikes occurred south large number cases prison involving prisoners wardens. Index cases 2 symptomatic prisoners recently transferred lock up. following low HIT argument, look social media accounts go back April May. Many pushing hard seasonality infamously predicted end pandemic early June even.

Bottom line know know winter behave. PH Epi community, consensus view, winter bad worse spring was. Wish would take conservative cautious approach rather continuing take risks like opening schools in-person. likely US next summer thanks vaccines therapeutics, wish we'd act responsibly. counting white house numbers get reported CDC CDC actually reporting we're nyc China. SSR. RIDICULOUS! Vaccinate working afford keep vulnerable isolated. That's bold choice. That’s happens politicize virus.

America’s hope vote out. don’t think happen. really dumb idea, get that, want earn money, cost many many lives. trump says works, I'm getting it. safety part phase 2?  guys r/COVID19 seem opinion ""long term safety issues"" seem thing vaccines.  maybe misinterpreted said.  testing seem directed towards rare safety issues, rather assure efficacy. article dated July 6. That’s way soon make conclusions. Pls stop using “proof” anything. Reuters article specifically mentions protests (from ends political spectrum) contributors July rise cases. UN reports referred exist? anti-vaxxer liar shuns government ""political"" possible vaccine approval totally takes face value statement someone currently running office. think political said earlier grasping straws rationalize beliefs. Yeah Philly. would say 1/3 huge difference yes.
It would like saying USA 250 milion people. ""wow, huge difference"" Trump exacerbating it, needs clear scientific messaging vaccines, trials work, progressing faster usual. media really letting people here, scientists experts spouting bunch contradictory “could” “maybe” “we think” “possibly” statements helping. know due policies herd immunity? False. NYC opened indoor dining schools still out. moron would surprised caught again. Since describe karen??? Karen's people tattle you. Gonna call police, gonna speak manager. Karen feels entitled control you. don’t think wide adoption safe effective vaccine get everything back normal? Knowing number deaths period pandemic enough. calculate excess deaths still need know many people would *expected* died pandemic occurred. common compare number deaths period pandemic average number deaths period previous years.

In absence crises, often small variability number people die year-to-year. looking death tolls previous years understand baseline many people would expect died without pandemic.

As example, calculate number excess deaths given population May: could look total number deaths observed May year, subtract average number deaths May previous 5 years.""

So Covid deaths adding excess deaths (especially March - May) likely lower people remaining quasi-lockdown. means things normal COVID likely under-reported 210,000ish excess deaths. Regardless going spun, many deaths expected rate death US time period. data really tabulated years, likely get better grasp going great look US regardless. expected due politics involved.  

My attitude that, indeed serious, dangerous pandemic, expediting release vaccine somewhat reduced testing protocol justified.  

But guess conflicts political goals let people die virus, depression, poverty.  least vaccine full suite RCT. spread people inside. Cold weather force people inside much summer. South America happy see lot “you’re disparaging hard work!” Responses write places. I’m genuinely stumped hard work is, know first hand people it’s Jack shit. Go Instagram look Northeast boardwalk, tons people 0 masks. kind ceiling hit NYC reached 20% population infected. Diamond Princess captive COVID study everyone ignores. I’m sure doesn’t appear 20% population get COVID trend appears happened Arizona well. don’t even masks? RemindMe! 4 months makes say that? agree immunity last least year, expect that. 

To test super low HIT we'll see happens indoors cold flu season. low HIT see another spike, see spike know theory working limited data incorrect. completely wrong. Even thin poorly fit mask helps substantially. Sure work well, difference compared mask staggering Yup. meant forced already dangerous situation jump thru hoops evaluated year. honestly i'd skip time around. Given vaccine rolled winter/early spring, passing couple bbq/pool parties big deal. gf passed bridal shower invite sorority sister. supposed dozen girls want chance given we're hot zone SoCal. Try keep latest science. Coronavirus seasonal ""44 percent would vaccine others tried it"" right goes show serious issues educating people vaccines. believe US vaccine candidates using least 30,000 participants phase 3 trials. even placebo candidates removed, would still put 20k people ""tried it"" ya. time average american would able get vaccine, millions would already vaccinated US alone. 

Saying going wait weeks see happens like saying ""I'm going wait get clorox wipes amazon lowers price week two"". Sure buddy, ball totally court one. US need second wave President pro surfer. ""One big wave need bro"" *hits blunt* ah, yeah, work linking coronavirus updates whole, article directly. try entire link (just copy paste) jumps specific article: automod still allow, pls send link reddit post try approve there. wants vaccine end year. 2nd term plan Jokes aside, think able keep proper distance key getting things back track towards normal. pretty successful restaurants shops without pushing R-number 1, least summer.  


That's something that's easy see judge visitor, contrast cleaning device whose efficacy people difference makes risk managementn completely invisible unknown. 🤞! say guidelines facility positive patients returning congregate setting.

Anyone read them! It’s like top secret Manhattan Project. Granted it’s scientific articles, need someone like Bill Nye Fauci standing somewhere explaining process results simple terms. Maybe nice graphs visuals aids haha.

Instead Trump going “it’s going best believe me” media turning vaccine process horse race. Care show us peer review studies confirm 20-30% infection rates? Thalidomide turns pandemic needs air, sunshine people selfish assholes.  That's like school bully syndrom, bullies often got bullied themselves.

With said, I'm sure ""every"". I've seen plenty men too. viruses latent intracellular pathogens elicit NF-kB driven cellular immune response, response causes disease symptoms, becomes chronic excessive.

The disease symptoms arise two ways:

1. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced inside cells, order kill pathogens. many produced, cell damage, ultimately, cell death results.
2. Receptors used pathogens enter cells downregulated order restrict infection. usually takes form reduced expression, desensitization receptor blockade antibodies also seen. prolonged, contributes cell death.

Receptor dowregulation also often causes disease symptoms unrelated cell death. example, ACE-2 receptor downregulated response infection SARS viruses, results severe vasoconstriction, lung capillaries cannot take sufficient oxygen, systemic hypertension also result.

Although infection major driver, chronic, aberrant NF-kB activation also frequently occurs absence infection, also results excessive ROS production receptor downregulation, resulting disease. example, reduced expression sensitivity insulin receptors results type 2 diabetes, acetylcholine NACH receptor blockade antibodies results myasthenia gravis (and possibly chronic fatigue syndrome), blockade thyroid stimulating hormone receptor causes thyroiditis.

So, infected cytomegalovirus SARS-CoV-2, could 'double whammy', many possible coinfections, example Borrelia burgdorferi, causes Lyme disease, mycobacteria (TB, leprosy), Hepatitis C, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Toxoplasma gondii protozoon, rest herpes family. anyone know anything Vitamin seems working studies? would liked ask thread locked [We put signs like looked place up.

When disease almost gone, run trouble want wipe completely, yet vaccine potential cause tiny number cases disease supposed preventing. wipe last cases?

This problem they're dealing with. read :

my take 56% signed far-right conspiracy “replacement” theory 

so nationalists aiming rocking government's stability push higher education

in france would mean they've attented least part first year post-bac (usa's GED), *not* graduated year, got degree end several year cursus it.

In book, ""higher education"".

Honestly we'd learn got people assessed psychologically. think age education factor, susceptibility enbrigaded absurd bullshit existing mental health condition definitely is. vaccine could kill vulnerable, prevents nonvulnerable spreading it. herd immunity exist without 1) vaccine 2) 60-80% population infected

Neither met herd immunity possibility Exactly, hospital ICUs max near max capacity July beginning August many parts US. Texas much better hospital capacity, due school reopenings, Labor Day partying, people failing keep social distance /masking things dire anymore like July, surges cases weeks back hospitals overwhelmed, compounded colder weather/flu season arriving November.
