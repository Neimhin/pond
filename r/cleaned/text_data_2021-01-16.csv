0,2021-01-16," Well, surprise live UK. stark contrast incompetence we've seen government now.

This doubt partly helped infrastructure place NHS, national flu vaccine efforts every year. much quicker focus scalability increase it, start scratch. It'll interesting see countries without national healthcare achieve similar rollout speed. saying knew much cost home lot service users, appalled fact. I've never said government blame, nhs, much waste outsourcing, regardless. fit purpose operates. Thank you. people I've seen disregard even basic things like wearing face masks old people we're upending life ""protect"" post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Looking like I'll get mine Feb time can't wait! Yeaaaaa, well, context matters. Palestinians get shafted. Hardly something proud of.    works. vaccine protect contracting virus. think people support lockdowns value human life. They've shown blatant disregard costs imposed people vulnerable COVID. care us, act differently toward them? wh—É forms averaging suck. See previous comment, spoon feed you. NHS become cult last year, see clapping sensation. way. that's fault government privatising NHS though. Also care sector never socialised, although IMO sources? Damn guess I‚Äôm going get someone fam cut hair Anything temporary acceptable. Stealing wastage still value money system world. Clinical trials covid drugs examined well due hive nature NHS. NHS amazing thing plank üòÇ Unfortunately, social media provides audience antivaxxers spent single day lives studying practicing medicine. Man, people really anything poon.

Touch deprivation joke know vaccine true indication true mRNA vaccines?  clear, yes released Phase 2 data still peer review yet afaik  OC much better LA (I‚Äôm LA). tried tho, cute. people want schools open wtf reassuring hear, heard nothing doom gloom Health Service's ability anything well due overstretched underfunded last 10 years. Makes really happy. 

Thank work too. rest us fortunate frontline workers yourself. Covaxin released phase 1 phase 2 data online, I'll link later (on phone now) find simple Google search. 

The main controversy given 'emergency use' even complete phase 3 trials. Fear government healthcare cause past experiments cause doctors/nurses treat pains seriously. listen people subreddit. read statement looked supplied data. majority enough. fact lots people wear ill fitting masks large gaps fall nose. okayish everyone wearing masks take one infected person wearing mask mess up. 

And depends clearly. I've observed lots restaurants shopping places third wearing masks. Machismo bars sports bar restaurants less half. places feel regulated like grocery store good, like 90%. see like 5:1 nose sticking v complete mask.  Wow convinced me, congratulations. remember, absolutely ok admit wrong. think taking death rate given calculating many deaths would 200 million infections.

When fact, death rate calculated value. Number people died number positive cases. 

Idea actual number infections much tested number, death rate would less understand be. Yeah got communication idiots got idiots like think smarter really are. OP clearly talking world without flu, vaccine could end it. position absurd. many human beings could afford week without work? taking position here? anti vaccine position? pro flu position? People take current flu vaccination work well. shot dark every year. vaccine ends flu popular MMR. belief think have? dying fun? Jesus. Ha, yep!

ELI5 issues UK? keep hearing tuskegee experiments whatnot american  Wait mean someone actually put Trump's ugly face flag? Lmaoo idea  mean...most people eat raw fish awhile lol. ever sushi? Also, highly doubt that‚Äôs main culprit entire population eats raw fish everyday. Resorting calling names shows argument already invalid. idea ""mass"" anything sounds like bad idea. wise divide among smaller vaccination centers? hear UE TV everyday I'm Spain yeah sometimes mess this... feeling pride country? felt years long supported clinical trial data, purely speculative. 

Anyways, address concern partial immunity 2nd shot lead new mutations. longer time shots, greater opportunities virus mutate patients partial immunity. definitely already feels way California. fact 2nd last country vaccine roll-out pretty much last straw. I‚Äôm teacher. schools first reopened here, first week back, girl came right close me, pulled mask could hear her, said ‚Äúmiss feel sick. fever cough‚Äù. Guess fever cough following week. Luckily wasn‚Äôt covid absolutely furious. Teenagers gross anyone ever set foot school could tell they‚Äôll share illness have. Yeah parents (the grandparents) used pretty involved picking school. I've likely lost last chance ever child. pretty devastating. Poland, reopening, ""young children transmit Coronavirus"" First old get it. rich get it. middle class get it. get bud true more. upgraded status recommendation against. See vaccines remedy people hoping for. people get jabs like ""so, vaccinated, don¬¥t care anymore, want life back NOW"" 

 behave like monkeys running around without masks caring social distancing anymore whit Trump enough people vaccinated viable yet. probably set enough countries adopt vaccine passports. Exactly numbers much higher: 91% first dose 95% second. trying protect one individual, individual better getting two doses. trying impede spread virus among population, better strategy give many people possible first dose start second.

For example: use first 67 million doses give one dose every person UK, made **91% UK population** immune Covid. use first 67 million doses give two doses half people UK, made **48% UK population** immune (i.e. 95% immunity times 33.5 million people, divided 67 million population). former seems like option would much radical impact spread virus. 370 million+ years life lost I‚Äôm glad said it. bot ping erase last sentences I‚Äôve read? consolation, entire covid thing omnishambles UK government actually addressed Sharon Moalem, M.D., PhD's book, Better Half.

In synopsis, women harder make genetically speaking less successful live births. successful birth, women generally predisposed stronger immune systems (that overactive fault, e.g. autoimmune disorders attacking body women, like lupus) overall this, generally longer lifespans men. 

So statistic women surviving, even though many older demographic, consistent genetic &amp; immune function correlation findings. Boris‚Äôs government full incompetent chucklefucks. NHS not. Ireland, schools never reopened Christmas break. Though talk reopening special needs schools, since closure really damaging child development remote learning effective. *There said it*

Did think said something edgy controversial? It‚Äôs fact. 95% efficacy means 95% reduction people developed symptomatic covid-19.

The 1% death rate among people identified covid 19.

These figures reduce death rate 0.05%, simply multiply together.

I‚Äôm sorry. really hope get another chance. crazy sounds pandemic could literally save millions lifes future. country na cruise shaa actually believe numbers stop loved one dying? Yes? Right, said bollocks it.

This real reason EU fucked compared UK, refusing acknowledge perfect enemy good. Thank you, kind stranger! hope so, too.

Don't worry though, one thinks roses rainbows sunshine here; media (and government here) spend lot effort keep view facing public. desperately want hold precious Olympics, top quite cultural national pride investment seeming superior everyone else (ie: nihonjinron). people worry vaccine safety also shove shit ton processed food made laundry list artificial ingredients pie hole. decrease day Biden takes it.
Civil war expect.
Please note I'm europe political stance here. douche, know that? Thank you! wondering production issues, like second dose waiting go back, due reserves existing (if fact true)/a shortage? great know even one dose provides much protection. Missing info Novavax stage 3 trials. raping cattle somehow genocide? 

We two options

1. Breed billions animals nauseum. breeding animals displace native animals, destroy land pollute environment.

2. Stop forcefully [breeding cows chickens natural predators hunt them. 

Are aware cattle farmers hunted wolves extinction? aware farmers kill predators protect herd? We‚Äôve already got eugenics happening farms. prioritize cows pigs chickens we‚Äôre ok killing predators vital ecosystems.  wonder vaccination progression back russia since already capability export them. Thank you! thought referring something grave, minor side effects definitely worth compared actual sickness - even get started weighing HIV. Correct, know British experiments blacks, time US Tuskegee experiments, hardly blacks Britain anyway---Blacks started immigrating UK WW II Windrush group, really sizeable minority UK 1980's--By 2001, black population 1.1 million, much higher today wonder elderly patients arent dying due virus like norway vaccination. Welp ""every adult britain vaccinated"" gave false hope be... Wow, (obviously naive) view Japan changed!
I hope problems heart long lasting. Florida king data smoothing. fatality pattern first wave 4 months long even though case wave 3. people Pfizer vaccine though limited relevance pretty much measure India developed Brazil. lower GDP per capital ranked lower Human Development Index Brazil. smokers love habit. would live quit again, thing controls UC. EU's perpetual scapegoats surveillance: terrorism pedophilia. long term effects would already seen trials already extremely extremely rare worried long term effects pretty much gaslighting. first reaction tell eat dick, truth know situation, I'm sorry lot people direct community suffering fallout this. Sometimes hard see people start putting dollar signs comment much humanity trillions debt stimulus checks. open thoughts, also vitriolic reactions people start talking national debt without citing specific examples people gone homeless hungry life. 

I lost two family members year, though due covid, visit hospital mourn properly. Millions people that. much misery losing money, piece it. Maybe trying hold idea right thing going grandmother's funeral make comments like did. Like said, know situation, hope coping healthiest way friends family happy healthy right now.  They're still thinking it, certain. Realistically? No. long shot.

No one coming (except cases) border closed incoming foreigners several months (and since think around April, varying degrees); however, current, daily positivity rate cases soaring, despite limited testing, things looking good Olympics.

I, one, hella uncomfortable continued risks government expects people expose to, here, hope hell seriously consider pushing Olympics least 2022, possibly later. preorders though. Imo covid then. soon 60s vulnerable groups done they'll let rip. People desperate. Also countries approved vaccines theres demand black market.

Also might prefer vaccines ones approved emergency use, maybe chinese living america may prefer sinovac vaccine british america may prefer oxford? Demographics play big role medicine careful say vaccine medicine safe one population safe different population.   UK estimates Pfizer, extrapolate existing data, first dose alone provide 89% protection 21 days, maybe 91% 28 days. Table 1, Moderna similar.

Oxford's vaccine actually *superior* effectiveness given 3 months apart, possible mRNA ones turn same. mean, obviously giving two doses day apart would good, know best combo 3 weeks 3 months apart tested Pfizer Moderna. That‚Äôs correct, EU scheme always optional. indeed U.K. Brexit took place 31 December. don‚Äôt kill animals artificially inseminating them. think animal would prefer life torture early death simply could live reproduce? 

If humans would considered rape, yet it‚Äôs main way cows bred now. government secured massive diverse supply vaccines worked AstraZeneca ensure first dibs oxford vaccine. government made lot mistakes giving credit bad r/ukpolitics thing do. Question: shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúlow risks‚Äù take vaccine naturally develop immunity towards it? Im doc isn‚Äôt getting sick natural way strengthening immune system? like isn‚Äôt better relying vaccine &amp; leaving ‚Äúhigh risks?‚Äù Especially since there‚Äôs even data whether vaccine stops transmission. see many sellers selling frozen food online people actually buys got delivered postman... hand might help economy vaccination efforts. 

This thinking equality fairness also created issues. EU fucked vaccine orders this. Countries even start vaccination everyone received shipments. asymptomatic, mild moderate symptoms recover completely? never get it? Could rating transport storage keep saying smokers higher risk, seen solid evidence fact much higher risk adjust conditions. 

Like true 25 year old smokes occasion higher risk 60 year old smoke high risk conditions? 60 year old currently lumped general public essential worker. 

Maybe true, though suspect smoking increases risk little bit mainly people actually smoked significant amount. 

Anyone good study shows risk increase smoker? way white lie. caused harm general public's trust confidence public health measures coming generations. Unfortunately foot note long line missteps throughout history hind sight? one blindly trusts without verification sure paying attention can't anyone vaccine selfish piece shit IMO. Japan still realistically thinking hosting Olympic summer? realize haven‚Äôt started vaccinations yet assumed good shape heard Japan going forward hosting. sure people countries coming Japan right hosting Olympics literally welcoming world come one spot. would feel comfortable population wasn‚Äôt vaccinated. judging really curious Japanese feel this. employer pays flu shots reduce sickness absence levels. needs one ""hero"" ""just get it"" half office end week two flu. Thunder fire una, b space lack, can't keep - 70¬∞F clamoring better electricity refused hear us, see US delaying second doses anytime soon barring catastrophic production error (by metric, warehouse storing vaccines could also burn something...) they'll easily enough supply second doses. worry.  simple lot complicated safety demographics.  Funny we're told like maybe June 2021... every human thinks deserve both. stuff like finding ways cut line completely unethical, states trying prevent without letting slow down. 

100% age based nationwide would solve problem leadership issue. don‚Äôt many ACE2 receptors bodies

Utter bullshit. Every single cell body ACE2 receptor sites. country make investment  Britain experimented Black people??   guess read new strains popping f***** tried say something yes think so. case hear govonorors complaining auto mod like it. virologists agree me. it‚Äôs likely both. mink farms got millions infected covid, passed among one another. mutated returned humans. Since June 2020, 214 human cases COVID-19 identified Denmark SARS-CoV-2 variants associated farmed minks, including 12 cases unique variant, reported 5 November. 12 cases identified September 2020 North Jutland, Denmark. cases ranged age 7 79 years, eight link mink farming industry four cases local community.

Good question [archive link anyone trouble accessing article I'd definitely take chance unable emote day versus chance unable taste smell several months well, god isnt shit, science rescue!

where lead? fingers crossed vaccines diseases That‚Äôs absolutely lie. Typical. first world countries life expectancy 80 nowadays. US's probably lower due lacking healthcare system obesity. think it‚Äôs fast produce new vaccines, necessarily fast manufacture. Good question. article linked below, looks like phase 1 trials Moderna vaccine began March 2020 limited scale ""long-term"". I'm interested see delayed effects well bit searching I'm finding anything saying serious side-effects aside usual tiredness, soreness, allergic reactions. mild last days seems. 

If anybody point direction articles saying otherwise I'd love see since I'll getting first shot tomorrow. would like informed possible know expect. I‚Äôve heard second dose kind rough. got Pfizer, second dose fun all. fever, headache, muscle aches entire day received vaccination. physician giving vaccine said second dose Moderna even less fun. Still better intubated due COVID though. Best luck, friend! Yet Florida dropped 30th place country cases per million population, despite recent surge, dropping behind hard hit Texas California, two states struggle widespread outbreaks  Luckily that‚Äôs part daily regimen while! Thanks well wishes. last one report positive case pretty understandable. WV rural except small area near Harper's Ferry commutes DC work. sometimes drive miles houses. People tend live independent self-sustaining lifestyles.

It really one beautiful places America overdeveloped. roll people 70s beginning parts country made good progress 80+. lock harder, calling egoistic lacking solidarity. It'll fine! /s What's situation second doses? really hard find concrete info this. someone who's get first dose Moderna, concerned second one available? registration forms reminder make sure return X days second county health dept, assume means it...? Fuck shit. sacrificing lives stores open, food table shit delivered time. fault care. \^ This. use different adenovirus vectors, general principle same.

There even talks testing first shot Oxford/AZ second shot Sputnik (or vice versa?) hopes better efficiency improved logistics. Man going go Chili's would vaccinated everyone lived block, like Israel comes hope wipes us out. Living like living anyways. thought message wear mask even vaccinated potential transmit virus. believe currently two-dose clinical trial addition single want Moderna one, even two shots. Seems awesome me. I'll take whatever becomes available, soon becomes available. proper leadership helm.

The lockdowns always state thing. would rather die fucking Covid lockdown shit every years rest life. You‚Äôre correct. absolutely nothing stop spread virus. never lockdown. corporations stay open small businesses kick rocks. Biden takes kicks rollout high gear. may woods end year (would love proven wrong) we'll light years beyond started. Fingers crossed. Im UK lived large portion life.

Who needs drive 60 miles flake mcflurry? throw leather boot grill want feel like I'm Chili's. Nope

As wouldn‚Äôt double people available jabs I'm using week. Yes, mean way throughput too. willing play doesn‚Äôt really matter

You‚Äôre position decide that

You also don‚Äôt relevant qualifications decide whether it‚Äôs risky either 

The members JCVI qualified make decision think Finland 20% infection rate too? care spreading killing people? shame US states think household bubbles support bubbles people living alone, like governments Canada UK restrictions. assume population density rate infection well. general willingness people collaborate measures. Netherlands amount cases high dropping much expected current lockdown. apparent google data people staying home much, also compared previous lockdown. Also curfew might go soon. Also, countries supply enough. Netherlands ordered certain amount different vaccines vaccines bought lot approved yet. can't vaccinate faster happening currently, simply yet enough vaccines. would call vaccination/cases ratio finland pretty positive. Also get infected least 2 weeks first dose usually mild. city many people Israel, lmao first time March, alright really. really tired, catch breath properly muscles hurt. Went long walk weeks later stop times quite get proper lung full. really, wasnt bad.

The second time breathing problems, weird fever, really sensitive skin muscles. Eyes hurt. Within week fine though. Encouraging numbers lot countries. countries order doses entire population would need several times over? account spoilage doses storage problems? Well who's say they'll get time soon? I'll believe see it, gonna people trying keep restrictions years. Yes, know agree. favour discourse ""we need open sabe economy"". agree needs lockdown people stay home.


But blaming people job security trying starve live streets ignoring big picture. work live streets different business owners lobby Congress trying stop lockdown profits dammed employees.

You punching vulnerable people hiding behind discourse fit situation. good thing it‚Äôs cheap, easily accessible everyone. What? goal many people possible get vaccine.

14 people experiencing adverse side effects news worthy. harm. incomplete understanding initially doses delivered feds. feds allowed states order half doses. time goes fed instructs states order directly moderna/pfizer. ***30 days later*** fed rams states a-holes sitting 20mn unused doses start expanding eligibility. fed also says holding back sending everything got including reserves may have. Oregon state democratic governor interprets mean fed secret stash doses upset learn fed allowing access 2nd dose. nutshell hoping could order double triple regular amount.

What happened supply stabilized producing vaccines states use. fed trying get states get freezer business actually administer vaccine. gotten point fed threatened punish states lowering order amounts using it.

Who blame? Mostly federal govt shitty tiers also karen governor OR. moderna/pfizer? publishing kinds great news make sure stock nice plum -- mean let pandemic go waste? 

I democrat rubs wrong way adults can't keep politics simplest things. focking pandemic that's killing Americans FFS. think SOB 15,000,000 - 20,000,000 unused vaccines room run mouth. really hard administer vaccine. taking seriously 9 months plan. Also bottom heart good bye operation turtle pace. use [half doses European [may significantly reduces hey, get bigger numbers good pr seems working them. Michigan Department Health Human Services says B.1.1.7. found Washtenaw County woman. Officials say woman recently traveled United Kingdom, variant first identified.  Citation needed new game havent heard everyone reddit reads headline goes right comments proclaim would write article author? sounds like fun party game. Well applaud get vaccine want go back Spain Greece Except back December/November, house senate progressives requested make part first stimulus roll out, seemed somewhat malleable on, we've senate, 10k. 2k checks absolutely complicated, simple. Biden promised 2k. 600 trump 1400 biden, 2k. point looking like biden checks even reaching American public February. nitpicking around genuinely pathetic considering sheer volume aide literally every developed country given citizens. feel state gets past fifty percent vaccines used, get more. States past fifty percent used shouldn't. faster country goes vaccines faster over. think justifiable shipping hundreds thousands extra doses states like Alabama California simply refuse use states like North Dakota West Virginia run out.  They'll keep moving goalposts whatever makes feel better situation. Pfizer's 52% kind floor, real number higher, extrapolate existing data, first dose alone provide 89% protection 21 days, maybe 91% 28 days. Table 1, Moderna similar. also read Novavax thinks they‚Äôll results end Q1, stays track we‚Äôd probably looking early April approval Germany got push Go take look IOC's sponsors scientists estimated high, definitely scientific consensus. Well eventually mass exodus places see certain places giving shit time soon. already see time next year, ""Dozens people dying every day Covid, wear mask stay inside!!!"". clear correlation closing outdoor dining rise cases. It‚Äôs reason dose deaths areas strict drug enforcement. demand still moves less safe alternatives Honestly underwhelming goal. Israel able vaccinate 25% population weeks. I'm baffled everyone way aggressive this. shooting something closer 6M doses/day early March. We're already 800k doses/day Biden even stepped foot Whitehouse yet government. purchased vaccines distributing (for free), call shots.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Vaccine passports domestic use increase vaccine skepticism. UK gotta prove world best something.

Good news people though. wear mask day office. reference exactly? Nope, still get covid, still able pass on. minimum need wait til vaccine kicks in. Preferably, still making sure vaccines actually stop someone infected all, therefore make asymptomatic carriers, actually contagious, therefore actually stop spread...

WEAR MASK around anyone household least! Frr uuh butterfly g3rd butt tgis 4utjjfh j4u yuh 15th hyhhyy Biden promised 100 million vaccinations 100 days, bit weird since 1 million / day already achieved. Also cannot know sample composed (Age? Previous conditions?) there's control group.

I wish one serious study settle science matter. guess prefer keeping fear instead. I‚Äôve getting COVID infection almost month. (35 major health issues). one really nasty week followed month every days feeling like I‚Äôm getting sick again, mild cough, exhaustion, ect. I‚Äôm still testing positive too. shit lingers like nothing else I‚Äôve ever had. Well Israel bc literally surrounded enemies war footing times. fine name pandemics/strains/variants soon someone calls UK variant start crying. Get it. people age say ‚Äúit‚Äôs inevitable, we‚Äôre going get it, wish would hurry get with‚Äù üôÑMakes want punch them.... watch Isreal numbers closely. They're close 30% vaccinated, see number infection going pretty soon. Unfortunately seem much way official recommendations counter products manage COVID. would need check doctor. could find paracetamol recommended ibuprofen, general pain medication okay, nothing specific. 1st time March, 2nd December. 

Sadly think might forever now, single variant spread throughout uk whilst already careful... imagine variants popping shanty towns India utterly massive populations crammed together. Maybe they're referring mRNA vaccines AZ 50% effective one dose feel like longer takes develop, less likely widely used. seems like something would easier implement ready go vaccinations started, millions people already vaccinated. Ha, dude I'm sure even people know give enough shit care think, sure hell don't. 

Meanwhile, states cancelling appointments supply shortages feds screwed them. Maybe call tell they're wrong! mean terms effectiveness. main contenders low efficacy single dose. wouldnt surprised one also became 2 dose vaccine given statistics.

We find 4 days effective is. also people second doses cancelled knows they‚Äôre going them?

Option A- get half dose

Option B- start vaccine process again

Option C- CDC punts says get second dose whenever, order avoid outrage.

My guess C comment significantly deaths UK USA Asia people willing make small sacrifice save many lives possible. So, vaccine strongly-worded letter virus? Biden sworn in, we'll likely around 16,000,000 Americans initiated vaccination, we'll likely weeks away two vaccines approved. even possible he's sworn in, we'll looking rolling weekly average 1,000,000 vaccines per day. puts Biden *somewhat* comfortable position. simply maintain course, we'd looking 100,000,000 Americans vaccinated point March, targets elderly risk, we'd good chance looking end overwhelmed hospitals we'd drastically lower death numbers.

But think Biden's administration wants maintain course, think hope wants ramp things degree worth praising. long means people getting vaccine timely manner, hope majority Americans come together, regardless political opinion, excited that. Biden realistic chance cement legacy President first hundred days. It'll either President made promises keep, it'll President showed important strong federal action really is. I'm really, really hoping great job impresses us all, that's would best country world. didn‚Äôt run student debt relief. that‚Äôs backtrack. 2k checks complicated started Trump threatening veto $600. amendment bill added $1400. optics bad given totally botched vaccine rollout stimulus definitely warranted. Thank service Yes, yes does. nuts thread. Honestly I've opposite impression. single dose regimens seen worked? they‚Äôll ones looking stuff. Issues, especially fatigue, post covid super common among contracted employees. literally one pass middle virtual training month post covid. post covid issues getting attention be. game changer long efficacy least 60-70%. reserve lower risk populations save effective shots vulnerable. Astrazeneca incoming soon. patient friend, laughable text ""the cavalry coming"" Biden was, truly going remarkable 100 days starting Wednesday. administration option massively succeed convince cultists wrong. fear going school already gone k-12 considering vast amount research that‚Äôs found transmission schools low/nonexistent. Nailed it. [This study 1648 patients hospitalized Michigan key 1,648 patients, 398 (24.2%) died hospitalization 1,250 (75.8%) survived. 
Of 1,250 patients discharged alive, 975 (78.0%) went home. 
Of patients alive 60 days discharge, 488 (41.8%) successfully contacted completed 60-day post-discharge telephone survey. 
Cardiopulmonary symptoms (such cough dyspnea) reported 159 patients, including 92 new worsening symptoms 65 persistent loss taste smell. 
58% patients reported new worsening difficulty completing activities daily living. 

That's kind comprehensive, one study represent medical consensus, included hospitalized patients people symptoms, etc. Why? refuse wear seat belt also?? expect death toll reach 567,000 May 1, likely peak beginning February. Daily deaths expected decline steadily peak, reaching 500 day sometime April due seasonality scale-up vaccination. May 1, states may close herd immunity. transmissible variants spread US coming weeks, peak could delayed weeks death toll substantially increased. Hospitals many states severe stress next four weeks. Expanding mask use, timely reintroduction social distancing mandates, rapid scale-up vaccination remain best options reducing death toll.

We never gonna stop distancing wearing masks people say. r/prequelmemes would like know location Based 11 people got severe COVID. Hardly huge sample size. Yes, said, taking chances this. I‚Äôm honest I‚Äôd rather try play risky game virus, cause risk vs reward favor. might get couple months less lock down, might get new version virus resistant vaccine. game I‚Äôm willing play tbh. Yeah, guys still fumbling Brexit. 

We fixed 2016 problems become organized targets timelines vaccines. I'm trying ge Hope's much Johnson &amp; Johnson's single dose vaccine. learned others usually single doses dont cut it. Hopefully one wouldnt surprised ended 2 dose vaccine instead. rate COVID-19 causes issues drastically higher. COVID-19 flu. can't believe year people still spouting nonsense.  extra $$ would go pharmaceutical company would impact people needing healthcare. imagine orange finger marks walls. also like ride red traffic lights whether pedestrians trying cross ""no tell do"".

I'm pretty careful make sure wash hands thoroughly handling stuff. honestly know risk washing thoroughly reduces it. FiL‚Äôs GP called said ‚ÄúSomeone can‚Äôt make appointment use vial next hour get ASAP bring wife‚Äù 70 active, doctor probably thought better bet could get within time limit doddery 90yo. masks, life already normal live like big events already planned matter what.

Source: English latter part year (summer onwards) expected much better last year. Experts already warned first months 2021 hard. district swears Covid cases happens outside school, cases spread school. strange opinion science back up. yet hear testing classroom entire school sake science. It‚Äôs political, don‚Äôt want truth get general population. reason don‚Äôt talk long term affects virus children. economy difficult one discuss. every country dealing covid going badly affected bad single country going financial trouble.
Most things mentioned government failed act quickly decisively British public relaxed restrictions government failings.

If borders closed lockdowns strict beginning severe enforcement rule breaking, would experiencing less severe consequences.
Such mandatory mask wearing, ensuring people wear properly, touch mouth part raise utilizing bendy strip around nose.

But now, public, continually deal issues pay larger price it. might help feel better look closely reports.

Like report chest x-rays Covid victims look worse smoker's.

But indication damage long lasting permanent. Lung inflammation occurs respiratory illnesses including flu pneumonia. Like article says basically can't tell difference flu covid chest event one doctor commenting sees. CDC advising Covid worse smoking. needs kept perspective. media going provide that.

I think problem HIV knows evade immune system long enough destroy it.  There's recent study Lancet looking covid patients 6 months discharge hospital paints slightly different picture.

[Link article 6 months acute infection, COVID-19 survivors mainly troubled fatigue muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, anxiety depression. Patients severely ill hospital stay severe impaired pulmonary diffusion capacities abnormal chest imaging manifestations, main target population intervention long-term recovery. deserve credit course. NHS dealt insane pressure consistently last year, whereas military (as far know) experienced kind thing. That's people NHS recognised bit more. UK largest (per capita) diversified vaccine contracts entire world. government well ok acknowledge that. damn one saying paid... paid, know either? Well least Saudi Arabia need bugs cause parties pockets anyway. annoyed? think population numbers...the people dying boomers n shit...at one time largest proportion population ... don‚Äôt let media scare Covid...normal health people fine mean? anti-5G creams. I'm sure there's too. 1.5% lot comes asymptomatic testing. That'sa lot higher asymptomatic positivity rate general population. Think it. That's 1.5% healthy, asymptomatic kids. 1.5% kids infected given time 50% would infected June. That's lot. 

You can't compare positivity rate asymptomatic testing symptomatic testing. Symptomatic people much likely test positive. Lecce obviously wanted keep schools open published results way made 1.5% seem low. that's misleading. Also, community transmission already extremely high Toronto November December. vaccines administered correctly? I've heard Scotland started disregarding protocol vaccinations, people getting second vaccination months they're supposed recommendation vaccine manufacturers annoyed smoke detectors became mandatory Germany 2 years ago, come see makes sense üòÖ cares , Looks like didnt read starting lines . Indians boycotting china . HDI ..its make covid vaccines...they cant...so asking countries . India sending 2 mil doses india made vaccines . stfu Please edit link real website kill freaking amp links. needed, we'll pick put quarantine center sure. greater good. ran numbers province (Quebec), vaccinate 5 times detection rate new infections. Jan 15th : 10,783 doses administered, 2225 new   Presumably done everyone once, vaccine available infrastructure working well go back around everyone twice within three week required period, not?

And vaccine provides protection 12 months everyone gets done year? better solution found.  protein present body immune response...

Still, auto-immune conditions exist ""said possible side effect"" external mRNA-input. wonder anyone pharmaceutical leaflet, comes vaccines, explaining possible side effects. ignoring facts like makes Neo Nazi Racist Sexist Paedophile, meaning ethically legally punch death.

Errr... yeah, ignoring ""facts"". much say tbh. US cant survive lockdowns. Especially virus politicized hell. bad around. France Germany one unified body provides healthcare entire population - that's NHS' advantage, also UK big role testing therapeutics; logistics made easier centralised healthcare system. Get fire detectors, people. working. New batteries new units need be.

&amp;#x200B;

People die unnecessarily every year even without covid. We're one organization. county live population 3 million. county expects capacity 25,000 end month. That's expected double end February. Misleading title.
3.36 million COVID-19

450k second vaccine vaccination complete. US vaccinating people similar rate. Enough doomer BS. Oh, that's interesting news. I'll read that. right there. Lol normal life span? According [this (Japanese) bulbs lifespan 20,000 hours stop affective. said ""cook"". fix it.

Ice cream different story!! foods eat directly freezer, there's good chance virus die makes stomach acid, inhaled. seem like risk even worthy mention compared situation hand. vaccines require -70 degree storage. likely prevent spreading virus, lot countries havr decline cases hospitalizations  Well disagree post either tbf. I'm always keen see things done properly followed through, constraints supply (and administration) doses think right thing get many vulnerable people possible dosed soon possible. Things horrible people last year think we'd wise try rationally positive way vaccination going (I one many people would amazed six months ago vaccines available end 2020). Good! lot arguments best way distribute, end day getting many vaccinated possible. LOL: Houses worship even open. can't pray home? real tragedies happen. 
Vaccines given meanwhile catch virus suffer consequences. cusp.
Horrible. UK testing less 100k day? LOL: That‚Äôs they‚Äôve pushed 12 weeks second dose Safety effectiveness based 2 month follow up. one knows long term yet. contract Argentinia concluded time ago, enough time plan it. guess first batches produced Russia, majority come Brazil. already Japanese people involved trials overseas. drug trials included wide range people differing ethnic backgrounds.  
 live overseas make less Japanese. problem is, people nihonjinron thinking, really see ""Japanese"".  Unfortunately, kind thinking prevalent amongst old guard particular. they‚Äôre jabbing 12 hrs per day 24 hrs per day. supply there

That's big imo, especially two week follow-up jabs need accounted for. BioNTech published phase 1 trial Nature mRNA vaccine technology used aid cancer immunotherapy. It‚Äôs useful technology. think numbers different? completely agree worldometers accurate reliable source. FWIW, US also vaccinating 4x detection rate. real person? spiel could auto generated. Anyway, better things

Pure psychological projection. Poor tactic too. ‚ÄúA total 447 AEFI reported January 16 17, three required hospitalisation. AEFI reported far minor like fever, headache, nausea,‚Äù said.

Only 17072 people vaccinated today due Sunday holiday. Maybe apply colony. Oh, I‚Äôll get vaccine. Promise.  don‚Äôt. American, seem like distorted vision Britain.

Okay, signed EU deal, EU countries encouraged ensure EU poorer countries access vaccine, number vaccines EU could access lowered due France choosing veto additional Pfizer vaccines offered.

I'm really sure point trying make, honest. EU countries signed EU deal pull go own? UK already left EU, countries risk undermining Bloc. It‚Äôs insane many deaths. haven‚Äôt seen statement Pfizer saying Azar full shit? Yeah. Jan 6 misunderstanding. burn down. demolition team could rebuilt ground up. /s

Either way, I've never heard anything good White House far nice place. could probably use significant makeover. times roll dice, times get snake eyes Huge, true. could become excellent discussion data method selection bias. I‚Äôd ask determine observations representative first, link upvotes contributors‚Äô sentiment. 

For example: log time every day? popular time everyone log in? know?

And: contributors get upvote? not, many non contributors there? know?

There countless parables near-sightedness, pick one resonates personally. sincerely wish luck. We‚Äôd like vaccinating 2-3 million day. doesn‚Äôt mean actually enough doses hand able it. he's wrong think people severely underestimating many people aren‚Äôt going take vaccine. wouldn‚Äôt surprised it‚Äôs pretty even 50/50 split while. That's interely true.. Sinovac Astrazeneca (Coronavac Oxford vaccines) requested approval 10 days ago. fully agree Covid death counts unclear individual cases, uncertainty individual cases disappear sample size get large enough, medical statistics work. actually good idea many years 80 year old 2 know serious medical conditions expected live, use life years (sometimes quality adjusted) make treatment decisions. give one patient died asked whether died *with* Covid *from* Covid, answer probably going ""I know"", give thousand people known ages health conditions asked ""should people lived another 10 years, average?"" answer would quite confident. Canada functioning government, doubt it. Late September maybe let loads people die would convenient 
? J&amp;J roughly vast majority us going get. vaccine waiting order phase 1C beyond begin. Assuming J&amp;J ships later March, Phase 1A 1B complete anyway. timetable April general population vaccine still table. None vaccines going approved children time soon 210 million adults, good portion already COVID I‚Äôm assuming opt out, 1/3 medical workers opting need maybe 250-300 million doses vaccinate everyone wants one. That‚Äôs even including J&amp;Js one shot vaccine future vaccine please still acknowledge way GB vaccinating absolutely fucking stupid actually make sense, higher likelihood create vaccine resistant strain like this. upping speed vaccinating people good news, 12 week period shots actually idiotic. think concern totally understandable, really gamble experiment, decision based data submitted Pfizer Oxford/AstraZeneca evaluated UK Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation single dose protection level known. Providing second dose given point (as booster first dose), effective getting within 21 days.
It also makes sense get twice many vulnerable elderly people first dose (particularly UK dealing infectious variants virus Brazil South Africa versions) rather half many two doses. Damn told last year wouldn‚Äôt believed you. Thank god nightmare over. Again. None access level information JCVI members vaccine roll out

Everyone sit say oh it‚Äôs supposed 21 days they‚Äôre 12 weeks sounds bad. done research made decision based facts also best case scenarios

It‚Äôs lot better 15,000,000 old people 58% immunity 7,5000,000 90% immunity  I'm 18, know lot people who've gotten it. one lasting side effects, one guy even bad symptoms slight fever week. He's least healthy friends he's probably 5'4 200. people know sniffles couple days honest. serious side effects sure, think hitting age group 80 82. wish know that. Also 75% die Italy (all ages) 3 serious preexisting conditions, 90% least 2. [Here's data official italian government health organization (ISS) proves save deletion. Read fast people gets memoryholed wrongthink. existing vaccines require two doses. 

The J&amp;J one different requires one.  Christmas parties gift keeps giving. feelings valid. However, important recognize high-stress events (even positive ones) pregnancy family fuel depression anxiety make difficult accurately assess world. cancelled Olympics? understand want let know purpose write anything would cause much trouble. good week. love people talk things actually know talking about. Unfortunately ""pro"" sub, meaning sub anything say, long fits narrative, accepted going hospitals.

You say like something odd. Trained medical professionals hospitals reason going specifically solely storage requirements, availability training. 

This people spread misinterpret information. sending vaccines CVS (not hospital), yes, also storage requirements, short supply cannot jab anyone walks needle. addition, sent CVS 100's lines long random people wanting get jabbed one person CVS certified who'd discussion multitude things. like influenza unfortunately huge portion hospital staff consumed caring covid patients.

I also love allow anecdotal information become default spreads...

There one hospital US, one time visit encapsulate them, give insight assure ""a huge portion hospital staff consumed caring covid patients."" true. true all, true majority. Covid bad, yes, decimating health care facilities. like journalist talks heavy rains goes stands deepest puddle find waders. news (all it, including here) goes one hospital stretched reports ""all"".

It bad *in places* bad someone says covid fraud, equally bad someone says end mom got first shot yesterday. took get it. talking nurse, working 7 days week. 5 days covid units, two days week giving vaccines.

That's specific (if true) widespread, also anecdotal. also includes willingness nurse working ""7 Days"" misleading suggests medical staff overworked. tell us nurse (or anyone) accepting extra time people work week weekend shot lot convenient. Overtime = good money some.

Your source mom nurse likes chat.

My source wife, real live secondhand story nurse, asked she'd like work weekends giving shots, said no, co-worker sad yes, wanted overtime. dire need, request, open appointments weekend help potential pressure, help patients get weekend.

Without context, course sky end day, medical staff pull types hours long getting worst part covid hitting states .

Says non medical expert, sketchy information sources, spoken like authority.  Personally speaking, worked labor job almost dozen years 10-11 hours day 6-7 days week. sucked ass, wish anyone, bad make be, I'm older, so.. know, work different work younger anything 40 hours literal torture human rights violation.

As pertains above, try make sound like nurse working 12+ hours day 7 days burnt out. reality, likely 9-5 job ***chosen*** work weekends. places much worse, yes, staff indeed stressed, general, comes vaccine delivery, one working 24/7 it. work like that, covid vaccine life saving procedure thus require kind schedule.

Why even bother knowing going get hammered probably banned?

Because worst part covid millions people need medical care go doctor hospital either afraid catching covid buy hype every medial facility overrun corpses. bullshit going eventually kill harm people.

Covid put entire gamut human ailments hold. many ramifications telling people now, fear sowed populace.

By way, Moderna, modern ""specific storage requirements"" mean insurmountable.

But r/coronavirus, think world going end tomorrow, crackpot. people complaining lost homes, jobs marriages? Shows vaccination priority Brazil I'm 18, know lot people who've gotten it. one lasting side effects, one guy even bad symptoms slight fever week. He's least healthy friends he's probably 5'4 200. people know sniffles couple days honest Well... COVID vaccine procurement roll-out? literally point comment?

Either way, don‚Äôt know asking - I‚Äôm hardly flag-waving tories.  Im wrong! 

Cmon R/coronavirus....Be fair. money. regulatory approval. Brazil granted approval use Curavac Oxford vaccines. vaccinate earlier approve vaccines earlier. Many scheduled second dose

In county people given second appt time date straight first dose

Stop spouting shit sure feasible. Almost everyone group knows friends family make adjustments. people may difficult crammed multi-generational housing others feasible. Frankly surprised continued see steady fatality rate exactly demographic month month. group would super careful. in-laws 80's super cautious. Californian unacceptable. I'm almost thinking starting protest front vaccine site. fired. job. going refuse treat lung cancer patients don‚Äôt like smokers? refuse treat people injured gunfire don‚Äôt like gun? I'm sort glad U Saskatoon developing vaccine... may get quickly way argument name means something put front use right. names going update lexicon for, order use properly.

Just name came word meaning mean treat name like word. That's simply English works. maybe that's Russian things done English. word becomes name treated like proper noun. proper nouns get word put front English.

If word Ukraine means borderland, insisting putting word front means referring generic borderland, country's name. That's little bit disrespectful think. would like referring United States colonies, referring Australia prison island. Come on, man. Get times. Let people live decide called, use word them. dude‚Äôs bone-head what? * England vaccination rate. UK. bruh I've lost 30 lbs since June plan losing another 20 lbs year. absolutely terrifying disease people carrying around extra weight.  

Every single person know died Coronavirus overweight elderly. Wrong Oh, know. lived China awhile wore masks there. problem all. Besides, said, keeping positive always advisable. Wait one month see Brazil top 5 vaccinated country follow science behind vaccine? inactivated virus approach used China old technology. AZ/Oxford modified adenovirus somewhat newish Moderna/Pfizer (US) mRNA approach bleeding edge pretty unproven. 

Prior data reporting efficacy interesting see predictions one would effective. Certainly China confident even going far start vaccinating people outside clinical trials. would picked US approach (mRNA) entirely high risk kind shaky.

Then data reported effective mRNA, adenovirus, Chinese inactivated virus barely effective.

Not people would predicted.

It's also interesting look respective countries biotech sector is. Yeah, makes sense cases could undercounted lot, would think lot severe cases deaths around would impossible hide. seems like somehow much effect Japan Europe US, given Japan likely uncontrolled spread ages way handled it. Even mask mandates Western countries able contain without heavy restrictions.

Do think delay reporting behind death numbers stayed relatively low? Try living Wales. vaccination rates nearly half England doing. also included british medical journal. 

How keep going like? try [this](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=Delayed+second+vaccine+dose+effectiveness+). keep Europe? Yes, licking boots employers definitely superior. mine  parents said thing, get. 

But took next level, talking social interaction every child gets shot, don‚Äôt know survive. 

I‚Äôm even high risk, anyone around me. people get shots cases down, really hope go Canada also bought another 20 million doses don‚Äôt need. I‚Äôd rather spent money get us faster supply Lol, kid 25 afraid COVID all. I've isolating, benefit family, especially grandma. college different story. let's honest, especially athletes around age, odds getting severe side effects? Pretty low. Pfizer may doses reserved, governors also misled many doses available Alex Azar announce federal reserve second doses. Multiply deaths 100 200 best range. Germany probably 5 million 10 million infections minimum, little shy, like 12%. Or, know, fix distribution program happen need get it.

The system staying broken benefiting charge. Enforce rich people staying place line. may suddenly find incentive making system go faster efficiently. No. Wrong live Wales. vaccinating glacially slowly. England‚Äôs daily rate 1 person per 175, Wales 1 per 300. UK equal. Welsh Government inept UK governments. tiny number people Norway died. 

It‚Äôs statistically significant hence might seen elsewhere no, sane. fair spite hiccups US still pretty good global stage wrt vaccinations. doses delivered overall vs countries also vaccinating similar percentage vs new natural cases, vaccines tougher storage distribution requirements. changes, J&amp;J AZ approval alone would increase throughout .. Thank much taking time call sister get info me! amazing go beyond stranger reddit. helped lot :) Even messaging someone else Marf loved one cool since it‚Äôs pretty rare thing people don‚Äôt know much about! 

I‚Äôll definitely research Marfan Foundation website.

It‚Äôs hardly even around 1 year! prioritizing risk getting covid spreading it, also happens unable pay it?

Rich people double edged sword afford isolate primary drivers rates spread death rates. vaccine actually cut transmission rates, we'll see higher transmission longer prioritizing rich people, hurts US whole. also risk taking previously healthy population making unhealthy, creating issue workforce. Many people recovering covid back original health.

Rich people American workforce driving economy. role economy actually change isolating unhealthy. That's average worker. That's right.. I'm worried lack vaccines, sad chance buy big amount Pfizer vaccines..

Lack vaccines exactly biggest problem since manafacfure them, need materials so, easy get it. data set claim? obligation prove argument. Read full paper, summary.

I'm done trying clue fact diligent research understand topic fully comment topic may endanger someone real world. Leave professionals. Go back clerk job Walmart. Typical American, mistaking money class. low minority.

Well said ‚Äúnobody‚Äù... Moderna much better vaccine. natural choice opportunity pick. Remember, beyond COVID-19, Moderna pioneered new class drugs, messenger RNA Therapeutics, vast potential treat many diseases across range drug classes. Moderna. Burned giant bonfire White House lawn Pfizer delivered 15 million doses US say many held back reserve. Pfizer Moderna ship 8-12 million doses per week 1.1 1.7 million per day. plenty give 1 million doses per day foreseeable future. Everyone needs 2 doses we've already given 14 million would something like 60 million fully vaccinated (both doses) 100 days. Lesser rate choice? so, that's problem. areas predominantly black population getting vaccine readily areas, well, that's another issue altogether. don‚Äôt think so.

We‚Äôre going forever. Mask mandates gone end year. 2022 indistinguishable 2019 average person.

Full normal sense risk 2019? That‚Äôs probably gone. There‚Äôs added risk now, deal it.

Full normal sense hospital workers *not* wear masks part uniform? Yeah that‚Äôs probably gone .... that‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs hardly change them.

Full normal sense we‚Äôre going go office coughing? That‚Äôs probably gone too. 

Full normal wearing masks, social distancing, going restaurants,weddings, dinner parties, avoiding office, children told avoid friends wear mask school? back soon. Probably summer fall.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

However, not.  Stupid question: even know still work get 12 weeks later? Or, plausible explanation.

They were/are lying numbers.

This one dishonest, secretive controlling governments earth.

The fact believe claims 100% truthful accurate sorts comedy heaven. US also vaccinating 4x infection rate. Lol people downvoting you. Funny right completely opposite recent public debate health Minister criticized providing enough vaccine. really think people forgot socialize lol Exactly thought. Something right numbers given correct numbers mention /r/ukpolitics UK something around 9,000 military units country ready help disaster relief, nothing compared millions health workers. UK military assistance pandemic saved need sudden surge manpower specific locations, allocate health workers permanent position. military size soldiers injecting people helping across country would misuse resources.

Source: Friend works MoD coordinating resources Covid relief. Lol yeah comes awkward me. Like oh hey regular person a...poc.

I hate it.  This. Totally forgot add this. Except Japan really lockdown. still allowed mass gatherings, albeit restrictions. Schools opened too. First, I'd encourage people read linked document rather assume correctly interpreted it. appears key passage, relating Pfizer vaccine, is:

 "" cases observed day 15 21, efficacy symptomatic COVID-19 estimated 89% (95% CI 52-97%), suggesting short term protection dose 1 high day 14 vaccination. ""

The document explains problems taking simple measure infections following first dose (the person may already infected vaccine takes time effect). Israel already administered first dose vaccine 20% population. nevertheless still highest rate new infections per 1m people entire world. takes doses administered significant parts population herd immunity effect takes shape. expect life return anything close normal spring early summer. younger ages, likely need hospitalization covid.

Gonna slap big ol citation needed one, buddy. great see Wednesday. waiting somebody push edge. Amen that! Shame wont shown like media. Really pisses everything goes anti UK/brexit agenda gets ignored literally never want wear mask again. hate passion. obviously hate  140 jabs per minute calculated dividing 24 hours I'm baffled current tory government finally managed actually fuck something up. right, bad, aren‚Äôt waste *yet*. article states 2.5 million doses Cali received, 1/3rd actually given people. That‚Äôs 1.7 million doses they‚Äôre sitting on.

Besides outlined risk infections also produce fairly large number accidents already overburdened emergency care system.  That‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs spread randomly throughout population. vaccine hopefully applied vulnerable, multiplying effect Hygiene theatre finest. mental gymnastics used impressive. managed make better smoking die sooner, cost less.

Nice. herd immunity even need reached vaccines widely available? case mutations? otherwise leaves 3 groups:

\-Those got vaccine: might get virus stop transmission protected symptoms

\-Those want vaccine: get sick problem. risk clogging hospitals yes, make low priority behind car accidents/surgeries/etc.

\-That leaves can't get vaccines, hence question whether could targeted focused measures instead large-scale lockdowns.

It may hard tell 2nd 3rd groups countries universal healthcare, though. mean there‚Äôs literally thread post today saying reported us. I'm sure small percentage. decision made move 12 week gap people would get dose two within 21 already doubt anyone moving forward will. brother vaccinated marked card 10 weeks. personal opinion think educated risk worth taking.

Edit: grammar *cries Dutch* ask plumber could tell everyone‚Äôs toilets ruined lol, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs fake, I‚Äôm saying shouldn‚Äôt let dictate everyone‚Äôs moods fear keeps saying 100M doses. hope internal goal like 100M fully vacinated cause makes lot sense. he's intentional saying doses keep expectations low say good job did. Happy side effect Brilliant hahaha agree I'm watching live.  TV dont see seeing audience stands really makes difference. Yup, they're actually population Israel, included too. Stockholm syndrome per se lot people miss WFH. commute, spend money lunch see coworker hate (I'm talking Gary)  remember one professors two little kids look husband work trying teach (and kids constantly asking help class meetings). almost cried multiple times. Sometimes schools opening (if safe) necessary. government could subsidize one parent watch kids three weeks month bunker wait figures drop.

Unfortunately probably happen :( Damn Suzie smokin' weed middle night. think US pay extra though incintivize We'll likely never know Israel got deal. Canada ordered large amounts vaccines certainly could afford paying premium. lost sense smell March 2020 enjoyed cup coffee since. get bitter taste profile. thing chocolate. Savory crackers taste like white flour. Rolling year. know USA this.

Have heard television program called news? That‚Äôs silly. modifies weapons shoot vaccine, could easily vaccinate people walking street homes. easier quicker. sady, causing free-up ICU beds. hope people take hospitalization number going pure good news. matter UK government administering second dose within specified timescale? UK currently closer 2 million per week.

Current rate 2 million week now. 325k per day. 30 younger, risk severe outcome much lower... Vaccination huge impact soon. going help, takes weeks develop antibodies point body made own. People caught covid still get vaccine case body's immune response robust, vaccine can't used treatment. mean goal shouldnt higher. Best analogy I've heard date explain vaccine doses.

Dose 1: Gives bullets shoot virus.

Dose 2: Gives plans make bullets future, shoot virus dead.

That's second dose important.

I understand people initially getting first dose great, might get levels control allow NHS cope, means piling risk upon risk.

What there's supply chain issue? side effects found?  Keeping large parts consumer oriented economy open equivalent nothing, clusterfuck US amply demonstrates Catching disease all* Yes. sorry, attempted whataboutism? speak yourself, speak Americans.

absolutely delusional. Thank explanation. fellow Phase 1A'er screwed part major hospital health system even though many us far exposed work hospital setting direct contact patients. Canada probably realistically seeing double number infections

Not really. Canada lower positivity rate. Ie. percent Covid tests come back positive. Also 2.7x less deaths. take genius see Canada much better US handling virus despite colder country. Till large scale phase 3 trials done, amount speculation make limited data ever guide public policy rational society usage become derogatory, even though millennials actually starting ones buying houses driving economy. Like generation kids, working hard. Fuck I'm not.  US receiving shit ton vaccinations ordered better EU. Easier way also administer more, I'm saying US credits Right, that's case. ""Math hard"" - Americans da real mvp Anyone remember (or still believe) police/teachers/parents/friends would say mushrooms/acid would make brain bleed? Yeah that's true either. Yes that‚Äôs said residents LA, outsiders, highlight large numbers covid positive folks are. Statistically, least many group size people age would expected die complete random. Someone know loss taste first symptom. case symptomatic, takes around 2-14 days develop infected. Concern impact Brazilian sars-cov-2 mutation B.1.1.28 reinfection.
A Brazilian doctor's reinfection, similar recent cases noted paper:

""The rapid dissemination variants, combined ability viruses harboring mutation E484K escape neutralizing antibodies, recent cases reinfection B.1.1.28(E484K) lineage detected Brazil raise concern potential impact mutation infectivity, immune escape, reinfection.

The findings presented support previous exposure SARS-CoV-2 might guarantee immunity cases. reinforces need maintain non-pharmacologic protective measures individuals tested negative, also already tested positive SARS-CoV-2"".¬† believe EU countries rely EMA approvals

They want. may lazy, may fear internal political consequences like no-vaxes raging sort decreased consensus. may trust istitutions enough approval, assure **don't to** rely EMA. Every State decided own, instance tells UK could differently Brexit, plain lying you. UK technically inside EU yet first vaccine approved track (Pfizer's), aside EMA concerns, action EU taken, none would taken States decided so, well except, EMA suddenly asking ""hay what's doing?"".

I assure however, EU cares lot much debt collecting proportion GDP much deficit plan run every year. really **care** that, literally one two EU countries going Parliament closed starting dictatorship. internal approved vaccine? fine Yes median age significantly higher Europe compared US. Look hospitals managed use 99% doses (Jan 4). used 15%, 30%. enough people vaccinate entire hospital staff shows every day? Life expectancy bullshit stat. born. Kids born basically zero chance dying covid, ever. Except vaccines prevent infection first place. ‚ÄúI believe evidence vaccines confident going prevent people actually getting infection therefore able pass on.‚Äù- World Health Organization chief scientist Soumya don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted, reasonable could well case heaven forbid die COVID, we‚Äôd count death COVID death, numbers would look worse. /s

In seriousness, weird obsession preventing COVID deaths cost. point, frailest members society, dying dying, it‚Äôs irrelevant whether it‚Äôs COVID another cause. vaccines given people fucking hospice? That‚Äôs idiotic disagree. There‚Äôs lot people love lockdowns want long possible think meant lock down... hurt encourage mask wearing make 6 ft social distancing common place winter months. Hell... gave everyone $600 tax refund getting flu shot would probably flu free.  fucking dreams Hospitalizations FINALLY downward trend. Let‚Äôs see holds idea. trump administration (habitual liars) WaPo (who go way make trump look bad), I'll go Pfizer. They‚Äôve saying zero room literally month yet graph kept going up. square ? whole world shut March-May. whole year. many 10 million people would died nothing slow spread vaccine comes out. I‚Äôm saying lockdowns best choice, wasn‚Äôt completely mistake. weight get 45 minutes VR cardio every day.

So... everyone getting ruined.

Also drinking lot liver might getting ruined yolo  can't ever increasing hospitalization hospitals literally zero room.  Belgium counts probable death Covid death. article read early said reviewed. Nooooope ""Based data have, assume patients died underlying disease - coincidental time connection vaccination,"" said Brigitte Keller-Stanislawski, head department responsible safety drugs medical reasons personal protection, could say anything individual cases, ""but seriously ill patients many underlying diseases"". treated palliatively. date, 800,000 people Germany received first vaccination dose. Pretty sure hospitalization rates plateaued awhile back.

Ummmm can't ever increasing hospitalization hospitals literally zero room. It‚Äôs clear article deal is. people happen die? clear death direct result vaccination?  (I'm physician since healed now), maybe first one flu. symptoms appeared like suddenly gradually days (flu symptoms almost instantaneous, fine one day sick day after), probably like flu; symptoms started gradually slowly, rule misdiagnosed covid, again, I'm physician take pinch salt words.

Anyway flu still *bad* road regarding itself, making less cases that's measured. Yes, Moderna Pfizer US receiving bit 1mn doses per day. already talk several weeks supplies increase somwhere 8-12mn (per week) translates 1.1mn - 1.7mn per day. contract two 120mn doses end March another ~90mn go.

Also USA right sitting 18mn unused doses roughly 3 weeks supplies.

In weeks likley J&amp;J approved although supply quite low number Feb 10-15mn march. &lt;&lt; single dose vaccine kept room temps.

In short supply lines stabilised slowly ramping up. anyone know thought process people want masks social distancing herd immunity? Friend school too. 

His parents 'treated' wierd Vietnamese herbal medicine. clears brown spots neck herbal medicine. please make vaccines available export soon can! monitoring side effects tracking everything database cool. central database help keep track side effects too. way media covering makes worry lot. Anti-vax propaganda spreading among Indians. know many Indians refuse take vaccines claiming naturally good immunity. tweets popular people like Prashant Bhushan (a famous guy Indian opposition?) example said Indians catching covid now, need take risk vaccine. (He shared article said 29 people died Norway.)

If propaganda spreads way spread US, difficult India. covid, general. Let us see goes. Hoping best. I‚Äôm sure. would probably better vaccinated. Vaccines provide immunity infected does. shit that's flu vaccines  there's clear plan open up, wont getting vaccine. Many others shoes. Downvote like govts need get plans sorted. India way Vaccines. bigger drop line due long term effects fear  Exactly. expect lot stories across come passed. Residents already compiling incidences address hopefully hold people accountable. China gets shit censorship rightfully so, American hospitals achieved outcome. Speak thing result maybe day local news coverage. Afterwards fired, lose health insurance, blacklisted working affiliated hospitals. sounds like plan make noise raise awareness risk retaliation low, staff shortages real thing leaves Healthcare professionals spot trying decide going public getting fired result deaths trying make best resources conditions find in.

 pandemic bets though, medical workers handing together documenting corruption catastrophes they've silenced pandemic. expect lot testimonies horror stories. Residents seem spearheading effort since they've taking brunt abuse even pandemic treated humanely. Hopefully wakes people ""how sausage made"" American health care I'm sorry forgot Xennials   partially agree takes help vulnerable people government intervention form mass, widespread testing, quarantine policies (no, keeping COVID patient home 85-year-old grandma quarantining!), contact tracing, yes, short-term lockdowns.

 Compare China's recent lockdown one UK, China's quick purposeful government actually trying stay step ahead virus mass testing quarantines COVID patients. removing COVID patients community chance spread, Chinese method ensures much quicker end lockdown outbreak.

Methods like used UK leave COVID patients community, allows transmission chains spread thus extends lockdown indefinitely. Long-term lockdowns, Melbourne aside, generally helpful they're usually done lieu effective methods.  Ah yes. ""simple"" solution mink up. Also alot people mindset know it, bother getting tested. hour long wait car govt testing dont health insurance. symptomatic real ordeal driver. They're right that. think *meant* say Millennials expected die *younger* parents. know that's true, least plausible. order millennials die *before* parents there'd nuclear war avoids retirement communities something. still didn‚Äôt work Manaus. got source that?

Again, assumption based ignorance, a*hole point view. normal LONG time. long vaccine holdouts wait shot decide thing ends. Yeah dont think right people actually jobs go vaccinated last. still refuted claim given consent lol.

People getting fined people ($10,000 person hosting, $700 eaxh guest) wearing masks correctly essential businesses. stop virus invading cells antibodies

Yeah HIV literally fastest mutating virus science knows evades antibodies like prime Muhammad Ali slipping punches. fucking terrifying multiple ways. Tough optimistic vaccines now. BUT, fact science found people seem naturally immune HIV (to point bone marrow transplants people ended practically curing HIV) equally insane think optimistic long term learn they're immune. Andrew Cuomo refusing shutdown New York state cannot afford it. would nothing left open, 2022 would welcome United States Amazon Walmart. That‚Äôs why. always why. It‚Äôs great, that‚Äôs situation. 

Right it‚Äôs basically race get people vaccinated quickly possible.

When see daily numbers I‚Äôm shocked village lockdown name only. Sick hearing New Zealand expect? USA strongest country decades biggest military. going get vaccines first one way another. shitty reality. never said many countries ahead, us fell short expectations least others managed avoid pitfalls Isn‚Äôt whole conversation getting old people vaccinated first? verifying healthcare workers actually healthcare workers? seems pretty damn easy, too, since would presumably employee ID card HR letter... US though. Never US. :cries California: Yes, absolutely 50k infected hundred deaths.

The nature exponential growth this:

50k becomes 100k within 2 weeks. Within month 200k. Within 2 months 1 million.

If crush early, crushes you. There's 2 ways go COVID: exponential growth crushing 0. There's real ""slow burn"" possible, shown again. Flattening curve work, curve always tries rise up. state local health departments dealing Covid-19. New rules such. spending time updating public, making new rules, contact tracing, etc.

Oh $$$$. States need $$$$ this. yet, we‚Äôre waiting bill Here, - /s - maybe get updoots be. mean, I‚Äôm sending kids school right now, really get you‚Äôre saying, think scientists saying covid different varying levels ACE2 receptors develop childhood adulthood. Kids don‚Äôt many. Also reading paper yesterday found exposure corona viruses, kids exposed frequently adults, also confer slight benefits terms less severe symptoms. two things combined explain kids ridiculously low fatality rate covid. 

But really hear you. AstraZeneca vaccine aka covishield completely safe take. Bharat biotech's covaxin determined safe phase 1&amp;2 clinical trials efficacy determined phase 3 trials completed. There's informed consent formed taking covaxin.

Current plan primarily use AstraZeneca vaccine covishield backup.

And guy saying opposition antivax saying bs. opposition well scientists doctors want know regulators went ""this complete data"" ""this okay use"" one day arguing someone COVID19 spreads schools threw bunch links saying doesn't. comes up.

I think problem figuring someone immune. can't ethically expose someone HIV test really immune. dunno, 5 year old let know pretty quickly loudly one games pause advertisement. who's claim vaccine they're likely die

lmao just...wow.

They're WAY WAY WAY likely die. in, death rate people 50 less half percent. death rate seniors 5-15% 1 3 according article. far heard deals exceeding $50 USD/person (Moderna = $25/dose \* 2 doses/person). Let people make minds

deliberately writing headlines scare people letting make minds. comment, bet family friends would really miss presence. /s No, don‚Äôt know yet.

That definitely impression one would get reading comments sub. Frustrating. Yeah restrictions everyone going normal lives. Churches open, restaurants, bars, parades parties. Except people wear mask least chin diaper, there's much compliance. That's basically meant. bullshit give us. Everyone knew kids spread it. Japan told us 1 year ago part indication vaccines protect strain understanding? 

The strain, variant, matter. vaccines continue roll increasing frequency, still protect strain, numbers begin fall Feb. timetable change new strain. None earlier strins changed time table. 

I originally came dipshit comment, changed course. think asshole. think frustrated possibly scared going on. instead responding kind, tell lighten up. *will* sooner rather later. able enjoy summer. U.S., hospice terminally ill. vaccinate them. friend died hospice. rooms private one person only. would anyone vaccinate someone likely survive days weeks most. Totally illogical. things far important numbers lower summer late spring. COVID restrictions need tailored fit situation situation numbers high right now. HIV incorporates DNA reverse transcribing itself. stop virus invading cells antibodies, never chance this. sorts vaccines gonna come out. Can't wait level üòÇ Friend said low grade fever, chills, sore arm 2nd dose. took day recover. Nothing first dose except sore arm. Pfizer.  not. UK variant spike protein changes Pfizer tested vaccine found still neutralized virus.  Speaking *very* similar experience last summer: ‚Äúam anxiety attack long covid?‚Äù test was, ‚Äúdo symptoms go away take Lorazepam gave ER?‚Äù answer yes, it‚Äôs anxiety.

I‚Äôm saying issue anxiety, learned last summer anxiety seriously fuck up.

If politicians cant get together general public needs hold accountable. examples countries states well (Israel, UK, UAE, ...West Virginia even) countries states arent (EU, NY, etc). seems like purely managerial problem Oh yes, say nothing serious yet something want put finger on... sorry bad actually Norway Netherlands... distributed well there's reserves second round.

Amazing distribution! That's even fair comparison. Verses dozens times previous year

Supposing using hyperbole -- getting sick times months year. either undiagnosed allergies deficiency.

Gov need get they're heads asses. ANTIVIRALS long covid patients??? can‚Äôt get vaccines makes us worse  Foreigners sent mail told test thoroughly. similar court order lead death patient recently?

Edit: Canada 300000 10 serious adverse reactions. parents, aged 72/74, serious cases covid March still taste smell back normal. get phantom smells tastes pretty much daily. Thankfully residual lung issues. immune receptor HIV uses get cells (CD4) incompatible missing, immune system clears up. antibodies seem last. COVID march got negative antibody test November, coworker sick August negative antibodies November. speculation small sample sets daily cases rising thing held equal probably be. reckon

I think that's driven new strain. Tor example Ontario Quebec rising whilst BC not. hoping thats got strain going around yet...  Since nurses allowed second-guess doctors FDA? Correct I'm wrong, understanding nurse's job administer medications/vaccines/whatever ordered physician--I think right overrule that.

I've got $5 says problem administering hydrochloroquine. That's point. comparing outcomes without considering circumstances. Medicine advanced lot past 100 years. Amazingly, opinion eaten ice cream 2020 reason - perfect temperature covid survive long time can't heat sterilize it. Cries Namibian. told wrong then. exactly. 

The antibodies produced vaccines actually varied natural response. sorry. Please stay strong. crisis eventually pass, many amazing things still coming way.

The loss grandmother unnecessary tragedy. Keep heart. right angry, think grandmother probably want anger really damage relations family.

I would like add virtual hug thousands miles away. Stay strong please id say even Conservative estimates say less 250,000 people getting covid im pulling arse vaccines distributed various countries? US supposedly administered 10 million vaccine doses, whereas countries much fewer despite securing access hundreds millions doses. take taxi/Uber drive thru? end despising government country like Sweden? mean understand US Israel lots intervention human right issues across borders, Sweden?

I think understand mean Swedish dumbasses, it‚Äôs one say ‚Äùmany‚Äù. said pandemic would now. clearly exaggeration parts, equally ‚Äùmany‚Äù, more, people saying lockdown less deaths, hard fast, hammer &amp; dance baby! Neither good predictions coming year would turn out. 

If anything shown us despising governments measures taken misguided since virus spreads across every different measure taken.  true tobacco sales banned world.

But reason not.

Imagine millions could save, smoke. Lots made Cobra Biologics Oxford Biomedica Biontech decision partner Fosun China Pfizer US base Asia, Europe Russia; however, European point view would better keep production Europe. enough big European pharma companies Biontech could partnered with. Countries controlled better rushing vaccinate, luxury waiting little seeing vaccination goes countries pressing ahead it.

This nuts, Australia New Zealand exact likes US, UK Europe simply luxury, virus [killing literally thousands people per urgent move ahead it. pressure Japan. would guess that‚Äôs major risk groups 50s. Many things government got badly wrong, feel real reason optimism. 

Dominic Raab said TV adults offered vaccine September, hope promise deliver action again. Lmao lie crafted politicians substantiated bureaucrats keep schools open gov funded babysitting one major backbones props economy. Lots vaccines that. It‚Äôs anything special COVID vaccine. It‚Äôs overwhelmingly mild temporary, lasting consequences. Vaccines, like medical intervention, carry risk. However, majority people risk small it‚Äôs inconsequential. still need past summer governments world seriously failed. J&amp;J, Sputnik Oxford/AZ uses technology - genetically modified adenovirus. write three different ways? think referring anti bodies infected el naturale , vaccinated. one big upsides socialised medicine. Shit like *just happen*. Also, UK mass vaccinations long time. I‚Äôm quicker attribute success NHS government. U.K. always going buying power secure vaccine early pretty much government‚Äôs job stops. 

Just NHS makes role easier countries without free point access healthcare. many providers coordinate smooth roll countries like U.S every single private healthcare provider nose troff / needs negotiated with.  work hospital, Covid unit. unit fixed number physical beds - that‚Äôs going change. census cap changes based staffing. 

During times fewer staff available work, decrease census cap accordingly. don‚Äôt discharge current patients spot, mean can‚Äôt admit patients beyond cap despite fact technically beds open. point admitting someone isn‚Äôt sufficient staffing available provide treatment. That‚Äôs specific pandemic. get exactly result 39 year old, guess they‚Äôre putting everyone 50 bucket case one many rises falls seen data reflection Trump's disastrous legacy. seems ignored every news report going. it‚Äôs super important. It‚Äôs also useful include storage requirements table...  Agreed. There's evidence large mammal (marquee monkey) Covid still spreads upper respiratory airways vaccinated samples. That's utmost importance continue masking even vaccinated. 

Basically, answer know. beyond middle aged nurses GP's. wife's NHS worker earlier 30's got last week, even work hospital setting. people reddit twitter trying push agenda ‚Äúmasks + distancing permanent‚Äù. I‚Äôm scared shit. Can't speak US UK, govornment would lie say never happened. 100%. 
If people start dying they'd keep quiet long possible. Brit, I'm confused we're getting much supply. done 300k first vaccinations day past two reported days (316k, 324k), takes us 2.1 million week. Important also remember Scotland Wales report weekends yesterday‚Äôs figure also higher this. 

I run figures omni 16 year old, underlying conditions, 300k day 80% uptake. pretty conservative estimate. first dose 26/4 5/6. mass vaccination centres opening week, would reasonable think push past 300k day coming week assuming supply Well. Kinda. Need like septuple number fully vaccinated people get excited *you* saying death rate is? 32000 people nursing homes 400 die every week. would appear pretty normal. Well going loosen restrictions either way, we've lockdown since beginning November announced extension end February (at least lol!) No. I‚Äôm social distancing entire winter rest life. March 2020 almost year ago, know immunity lasts long I'm saying different lot us. wish kind lockdown all. closed schools like, month way back March it. Many schools even close, even order, vague suggestion might possibly maybe want pretty please. :/ didn‚Äôt know Biden Reddit? They've said both. Experts said both. Yes many viruses leave permanent last effects. people seem grasp. Abs covid neurotrophic ones going nasty really hard figure out. suspect heart attack rates stroke rates skyrocketing get younger people soon.   reason think vaccine won‚Äôt equally effective variant This.

They've changed second dose timing recommended (and tested/trialled) 21 days 90.

This things;

1. Giving single dose allows say ""vaccinated"" twice many people. (You've actually half-vaccinated them)

2. increases risk supply interrupted (manufacturers said - remember month government *just found out*) people miss window second jab. means need first one = water vaccine.

3. messes outcome vaccination people get doses. trialled used 90 days, literally resting population efficacy.

4. increases sense ""I've vaccinated, want now"". reality, still carry vivid actually *increases* likelihood spreading around. not? asked everyone. I‚Äôve taught. I‚Äôve seen lice, visible parasite, spread nearly wipe whole grade level.

We‚Äôre talking respiratory virus airborne.

Common fucking sense. layman understanding issue ridiculously expensive run good quality RCT trials. costs easily ten million one RCT.

For treatments without commercial potential highly problematic. need somehow convince public third sector fund study, without good quality RCT data?

I'm convinced RECOVERY style trials answer. idea collect needed information part normal operation, randomize patients experimental trials. highly cost effective statistical power RECOVERY different level traditional RCT trials. I'm sure setup could used common severe diseases - cancers among them.

If RECOVERY setup would standard western countries start pandemic we'd excellent quality data around fifty treatments another fifty pipeline! It‚Äôs amazing many people die year. get rid lot people dying wouldn‚Äôt amazing? That‚Äôs why. Yes. Yes, mainly overdoses. get vaccine active covid 19 disease? Report spam. It‚Äôs repost half dozen subreddits. sputnik worth noting reinfection happen without mutation.  believe paper November said efficacy reinfection prevention 80% 6 months post initial infection. fact doctor got infected new mutation virus many case correlation causation. There‚Äôs lot unknowns here. instance, readily mutation cause prior antibody tagging fail? mutation cause spike protein work less effectively? current strains outcompete one selective pressure it? virus think win next World Cup Manchester United? used Omni calculator adding numbers ahead per government figures. Obviously it‚Äôs rough calculation doesn‚Äôt account uptake I‚Äôve put back cohort, also assumes we‚Äôre going million week we‚Äôre nowhere near yet.

I‚Äôve volunteered help logistics side got friends volunteering actually administer vaccines know lot work background speed things up.

But still, don‚Äôt start soon we‚Äôll needing large numbers every week get everyone done July.  say ‚Äúimmunity doesn‚Äôt last‚Äù ‚Äúimmunity may last.‚Äù

Those two importantly different statements Also UE. UE bought 200M doses J&amp;J option get another 200M I/it got attention first (assumed) Chinese troll. 

Reads like modern realization tale sorcerors‚Äôs apprentice. greater general population?  bet many people got vaccine also car accidents  Sounds familiar Netherlands. 

All plebs lockdowns, INTELIGENT lockdowns! majority Americans vaccinated start making numbers look like flu. tell years come. seeing public attitude even right shows last much longer.   works. However, clinical efficacy yet established still studied phase 3 clinical trial 

This part form

The entire article probably written WRT line know real kn95 certification...
Just guy China stamp ever Sunday

The previous highest count Sunday 1,494, last week.

I yet find testing numbers today, latest value find 13th 14,579 tests Tokyo [as according Tokyo Metropolitan even finished group 3 4 priority list Friday there's issue supply they're expecting deliver 20% less agreed ramp production.

They're vaccinating front line NHS staff they're contact vivid therefore high risk.

The government moved second dose 21 days 90, confuse one jab vaccinated.

That's trick government say twice many people done. need jabs (within max 90 days) able produce antibodies future. Otherwise short-term protection. many people due die within weeks? 

The question could asked many Covid-19 deaths. go back find bunch articles saying opposite past year. 

From 'reputable' main stream media sources.  actually unexpected. EU countries also able able vaccinate fast enough. western countries 4-5 approved vaccine suppliers supply huge point spring. think face masks won‚Äôt needed? sure mean.  Easter! There's need take mask picture pandemic dunce...looks like visiting Disneyland something pandemic well. care happens due stupid mistakes Oh jeez, TIL! That's almost certainly case. Entry level workers also ability stay home they're sick quit jobs stay safe. 

But family upper middle class refused stop massive family gatherings holidays. different Latinos. family circle whole world. They're people celebrate everything with. can't ask Latinos stop themselves. That's something never understood. virus like 75% (forgot exact number) identical DNA Sars 1, working assumption worked way less. respiratory virus spread way; colds/flu/other coronaviruses. scientists acted like mutant virus outer space never encountered before! 

It's like drank koolaid made suddenlt stupid. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è   using omnicalculator? somewhere else? Yeah, pretty great, remember population even 6 million. guess would much add ""mild"" ""temporary"" headline. 3 months smell still pretty muted. smell taste things, i'd say around 30% used be. R value many people get infected one person. absolute. high density situation lots people precautions R value higher situation people socially distanced, take precautions example vaccinated. Actions affect R value. average 3700 people die automotive accidents every day. Americans

I wish people mention America

Just media mean ones.

Lots anti-vaxx stuff spread countries Also take NSAIDs idk telling people upon vaccination quite irresponsible. talking number vaccine doses administered yeah, gotcha. Ah, I'm noticing unproven treatments highly supported conspiracy groups... groups rallying masks vaccines... can‚Äôt go outside can‚Äôt take supplements next best thing probably incorporate foods high vitamin diet. Eating fish, egg yolks mushrooms help. sorry hear. case probably vaccinate flu since seem risk group.

I illness last 15 years more.

For elderly? think valid reasons choose flu vaccines, average non-risk person think needed, flu fatality rates low. even vaccines country richer nations hoarding them. might end get fucking China. even trial vaccines. might get India's well that's better Chinese one least. know ment death could caused COVID, wilfully obtuse.  Yeah vaccine hard store shelf life. must kept well freezing believe say 85? added word only. hope live Denmark someday. guys seem good heads shoulders cheering bc spring break extended. bc wanted see ex gf days :/ . Little know entire social life would change send suicidal state mind top stress educated zoom. Tbh though. vaguely remember life shit. anything, ive become desensitized emotionally disconnected lot  Fake news. said another thread, every country enough idiots form protest like this. could happen New Zealand, South Korea, anywhere both... are.

Stop reading FB fake news. guess there's 2 types people world, understand math get covid. Pruritus (3%; Mazzotti reaction, associated onchocerciasis: 28%), dermatological reaction (Mazzotti reaction, associated onchocerciasis: 23%; includes edema, urticarial rash)

Hepatic: Increased serum ALT (2%), increased serum AST (2%) I... know words don‚Äôt access data yet. know second hand reports Brazilian government.  regardless that, kindergartens schools first thing opening every country.

lets honest, measures don¬¥t make sense, lockdown countries people anywhere flying in, driving across borders going school soon possible. I'm fairly young . Would safe head utter lack vit gonna make super dangerous head daily grab sun? u/maxmanium expresses perfectly - 'just quit dumb redditor phrases.' quick Google personalized vaccine program, mRNA-4157, based neoantigens found individual patients' tumors. company builds custom strands mRNA containing instructions body make neoantigens trigger immune system attack them.

This *is* meant cure (or least effective treatment). Agreed.  Certainly vaccinations yet, cases decline two weeks. see effect measures need least couple weeks *after* measures introduced. whatever causing decline happened already month ago. ok kiddo agree.

Wuhan last year pales comparison severity spread Covid London right now. hard thing control know would happen beforehand I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre wrong. booked test online (early December) tested within hour. efficient got results back next day. think SIL probably describing situation back March testing properly running. Norway show second dose. hover states. know gulags Russian?

If want pretend know China, least proper research. knows FB fake posts read Russia mistaking China. Cases won‚Äôt plummet vaccine stops getting sick look lasting side effects 1918 influenza survive, tells similar story. would LOT suicides. No, awful, align world view.

I Europe (doesn't matter country now), yearly flu vaccine uptake 8% there.

That means 8 100 people yearly flu vaccine.

And many millions don't. Even quite cheap free most. anyone it.

You offending beliefs, beliefs millions. regarding ad hominem attacks... worked performing high risk procedures two surges. always knew covid spread air... wore eye protection day one. 
 medication side effects. medication risk free. found previously plaquenil. likely effect current full lockdown we're in, necessarily many vaccinations occurred. food prepped doors even takeouts, prepper sick detected... everyone cooks. mRNA vaccines actually efficacious inactivated virus vaccines, far. According autopsies it‚Äôs possible mild, common reactions vaccine causes enough kill people. medically fragile immune compromised, mild fever day killed them. 

We already know risk immune compromised vaccines, they‚Äôre usually given them. It‚Äôs difficult make call right prevalent COVID is. 

If you‚Äôre severely immune compromised speak doctor. not, really nothing worry about. 2020 really showed fucking stupid, arrogant egoistic large part humanity is. Ok know English first language. I've never heard anyone french otherwise refer UE though using abbreviations  even Trump flag? Yep. 12 YO Kawasaki, terrified mis-c, here. Gonna long summer. test result takes hours, compared self quarantine.

I expecting enforce vaccination anyone within entering country. see people like ""fuck, it, don¬¥t care anymore"" soon vaccinated, therefore infecting people much faster pace before.

In december people say 2020 far better 2021. talking about? make claims please add source, 'I family switzerland' doesnt count. one case well someone died getting vaccine. Yes, assembled better word.

But that's better USA, they're running hospital capacity states.

Do hear talk assembling new hospitals 5 days? even feasible plans works? HUB ready anything. blood sugar drop (didn't eat day little nervous). asked snack bc heart racing immediately surrounded people checking every vital making sure anaphylaxis. also recorded it.  Whoopty doo, mean Basil? didn‚Äôt call people 18-30 Millennials.

He interviewee. article makes extremely clear it‚Äôs ‚Äúexpert opinions‚Äù, it‚Äôs interviewing people declared ‚Äúcovid generation‚Äù age 18-30 ti get opinions article.

He said Millennial wanted Millennials stick together. Truth best policy, can't keep treating public like children.

If deaths vaccine indeed true, need say hey listen old people could die vaccine, way likely die covid if/really hits care home/area.

Now old sick nearly dead like everyone dying covid, yea take risk that's you. really needs emphasized emergency use vaccine also completely new type vaccine. happens years taking this? knows, 70 55 diabetic obese, well fuck probably risk short term long term effects vaccine covid going kind gets get you, Spanish flu supposedly seasonal flu, took 50 million (and also lot less people back then) worth risk living decades longer. Again, decision, I'm playing odds old sick. 

If going head dark path. really true Poseidon-forbid long term side effect, getting bunch 20 30 40 years old take dying now, dying later, sweeping rug comes light, kids vaccinated medieval sounding diseases really want coming back. True, EU bungled continuing bungle vaccination rollout. Sigh...absolutely moronic. many words title takes away peoples focus. Unless left words articles too.

Anyway better getting temporary paralysis permanent lung damage. Transmission married couples: 20%.

Between dating couples: 100%. I'm Chinese, China, swell here.

Keep mind VPN regulated, illegal here. Come south, 88 year old grandfather awaiting dose care home staff. grandmother got cancer end last year finally appointment next week. 

To honest actually see evidence front eyes I'm believing fucking word government says. They've lied every stage thing far, suddenly different? Appears result vaccine, every case severe underlying medical issues. Including people terminally ill begin with. 75 work care sector, amount service users outsourced us local hospitals astronomical. especially maddening find much private care sector charging. one example, quick Google search find endless supply examples.

2.the amount virus exposed vaccinated person built immunity.

3.how well virus enters vaccinated host exit via host without replicating exposing others virus.

4.how long vaccine effect last whether immunity fades time.

5.whether virus eventually dies number potential hosts drops. Case rates showing signs dropping.

I‚Äôll give factor two. I‚Äòm sure agree one Germany happy if, end 2021, 20% Germans vaccinated. 

Those rates grow factor ten Jens Spahn wants keep promise vaccinating everyone summer. grow soon, grow even more, later. tight temperature requirements. None companies setup that. governors also misled many doses available Alex Azar announce federal reserve second doses.

No, appears governor's either wrong, confused misunderstood. Azar never announced anything. single WAPO article couple tweets governors. Turns wrong Pfizer said held onto vaccine request feds, recently asked start releasing them. said beginning. People like me? kind person think am? Yes themself blame aswell. Nobody forced shutdown everything months end. know much depend tourism. shutdown everything anyway. Bruh, got backwards. rest sub making nonsense vaccine miracle cure. I'm one pointing facts support that. Tobacco vaccine coming Brexit really opened viral trade opportunities. Denmark we're using everything get, supply problem.

If India's vaccinations bad, make think Oxford American vaccinations good?

The countries buys vaccinations India also check data administering. Plus problems India mess up, global disaster nightmare Indian international relations.  Wow, that's lot downvotes!

And that's fantastic ""your county"", clearly true them, it.

Maybe stop ""spouting shit"", stop trying spread personal experiences they're anymore read something that's mum's Facebook Oh actual saying intervals longer 6 weeks then?
Also, Pfizer states, cannot confirm effect vaccine 21 days, and, Oxford study conducted indicates could positive effect increasing gap, data rather lacking relying sufficient irresponsible. might turn indeed right, people vaccinated better immunity, right, literally playing people‚Äòs lifes. mean named 'COVID 19' specific reason.

I good chance would symptoms mild symptoms. 

But there's moderate chance I'll sick hell several days. decent chance I'll sick hell on-and-off weeks. small still-there chance ending hospital (and bills associated that, among things.) unknown amount risk moderately long-term very-long term problems. 

And real chance even I'm careful could pass someone lucky - pass someone lucky. 

So ya. I'm staying home. Sorry, assumed paid sick leave people keep complaining get North America. not. mRNA tells cells produce protein. modify cells DNA. Beat it.

Your sensations good forcibly match reality. many tumors people develop, near malign size even point cancer, then, feel symptoms?

Or can't hypertension *feeling* it? partially blocked artery? HIV years?

Asymptomaticity fine. means feeling bad. Conversely, also feel pain doctors able find causes it, even chest pain (e.g. anxious people). 

The damages assessed tests, test find something ok, called sign, symptom, disease. COVID already proven give people asymptomatic hypoxia, doctors find/found really strange, explanations. Maybe ok watch signs, nowadays monitor SpO2 levels home instance (which good), willing frequently X-rays? Probably good enough reason. yeah, think investigated more, many asymptomatic people COVID get also pneumonia, currently considered happens, find fear mongering. disease symptomatic, worry tumors screening all, feeling good? *ya' good* diseases protected pandemic?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Lmao poor wording. mean hand sanitizer tastes fine, meant general taste fine You‚Äôre downvoted it‚Äôs true. OC outperformed LA every step reddit can‚Äôt see past it‚Äôs OC hate. EU banked Oxford vaccine well. Contrary poster said, starting day, approval process portfolio. Supply currently approved vaccines nearly high enough.

Additionally, EU countries slower others. Denmark we're using everything get quickly much higher capacity, supply yet, pretty frustrating we're expecting see growing numbers new mutations.

I really wish less pissing contest, hope remember many countries way behind us UK EU. think get one lanyard wear go outside.   Sure, still take measures unvaccinated daily numbers high. *Maybe.*

The theory you‚Äôre referring to, soldiers front, that. theory. Cant inject virus bleach shine UV light them? There's remedy company bought lot stock might help too... mRNA covid vaccine works triggering immune response. say Joe 75 without vaccine would died immune system fight Covid 19. vaccine give extra ""edge"" fight successfully? Sounds cool, makes wonder announcement bolster stock price riding wave good news.  Trumpland still walking around dicks wind. despite testing, Astrazeneca vaccine showed higher margin symptomatic infections Pfizer.

This almost sounds good true. Time tell real another publicity stunt. government secured massive diverse supply vaccines

This expected point. I'm going give praise meeting bare minimum expectations, even look like great success compared history worked AstraZeneca ensure first dibs oxford vaccine.

Again, expected. UK-developed vaccine would normal UK government get first dibs it. exact thing happen got first Pfizer shot. typical side effects, fourth day, lost sense smell. fully expected lose taste next day, never did. got rapid test work since exposure scare around time came negative. explanation nurse could come really strange side effect vaccine. Thankfully smell come back since hot flashes slight aches second shot. dont see like that, failures directly cus inaction success. I'm asking risk quantified (with evidence) compared factors. questioning experts, yes. fuck say that?

I'm multinational company created groundbreaking vaccine unprecedented time.

It's even that, think know run company better?

Obviously! make mRNA vaccine flu? chicken egg cheep effective? Im saying Australia also attributes cases overseas, countries low cases. dont care internet troll documents dude, thats pretty obscure tangent. No, I'm saying statement ""US government give medical care"" untrue. Also, government something preclude capitalist system, despite Fox News may tell you. I'm suggesting anything. 

Also, that's government purchasing works. go force someone sell pens gunpoint. announce they'd like buy pens, they'd like buy $1.50 each. private businesses want contract compete it. federal government wants to, pay vaccinating everyone. announces give $100 vaccines equipment every medical provider vaccinates someone free. providers choose whether want that, charge people instead, work insurance, vaccinate all. Similarly, government can, last 9 months, sign contracts temporarily rent space use vaccine drives, staffed medical personnel FEMA DoD, themselves. 

None options involve ""dictating"" anything. everyone forgetting role military this? majority people recover covid, like illnesses, without medical attention. required medical attention, would seek out. Also look powerful enough.

If want spend minutes hours sterilizing something millimeter millimeter inch inch ...you need something powerful enough burn skin within minutes üëç Many Republicans still believe it. Even know gotten it, still deny it. use convoluted logic.

Thanks God saved. Apples oranges. Prisons hives diseases fuckton people crammed small confined space proper social distancing lot civilians work inside daily, superseeder potential insane. prison guard, doctor, lawyer, social worker anyone else working prison gets virus internal COVID outbreak, easily spread back community, plus let's talk mutation risk superseeder events. interest communities prisons located prisoners vaccinated. mean bots wrong, exactly appropriate time kind comment. hardly germane topic hand. Oh phew, second worried would Reddit post mention Trump comments. media problem solution. Pharmaceutical companies already shown extremely safe. trialed 30000 people much want. Anyone already convinced antivaxxer Estonia too, levels school expected opened 25th January. Meanwhile numbers worst since beginning pandemic. I‚Äôm even gonna click that. First one afraid covid. far worse diseases covid. Also many communities work fear lack clean water covid.    No. lockdowns put place government reduce amount people would catch, spread potentially die covid. government dicided extend gap 2nd dose I'm military got first shot last week.

Yeah, uk doesn‚Äôt seem real fixated testing though Fortunately RNA viruses tend work like (flu notable exception); DNA viruses recombination reassortment. RNA viruses families manage techniques Sars-coronavirus-2 included. Like viruses, require host organism manage replication like Papa virus get Mama virus drunk one night decide raw dog 9 months later baby virus happens. viruses exchange genetic material, infect cell time support form genetic recombination. DNA viruses retroviruses (that code DNA) mechanism cells (i.e breaks rejoins). Reassortment happen RNA viruses segmented strands individual strands get mixed. though possible virus. Even possible, clear dual mutations would interact coding spike protein. might cause protein fold incorrectly inert. They're talking LA county only, 10 million people. Hell yeah ! That's... works. Check math again.
To give hint: started two weeks ago vaccinations vaccinated 1,2% population. fair seeded many areas even knew thing point really care. States basically opened lottery system shots anyway. call couple dozen sites see shots, drive couple hours wait another 4 5 line see hit jackpot. sh!tshow. absolutely production issues. manufacturer one UKs vaccines admitted week they're going 500k/week short contracted 2million week UK  NJ Also, many us practical this. get point legitimately vaccinating people pace actual signs numbers says summer time events, I‚Äôll board. 
But right vaccines available part issue. don‚Äôt even enough people put needles arms right now. 
Let‚Äôs wait see factors lean toward April summer events I‚Äôll start joining ‚Äúgame won‚Äù crowd. Norway 517 Covid deaths whole year pandemic. Meanwhile, Pfizer vaccine killed 29 - one week? rate, Pfizer vaccine kill people Covid Norway. And? long people getting vaccines that‚Äôs good thing Unfortunately wait vaccines bought manufactured shipped us. Trudeau reserved vaccine doses per person country world. don‚Äôt know else could done. imagine can‚Äôt really blame Pfizer Moderna either they‚Äôre hammering vaccines world quickly can. feds helpless point. 

The provinces responsible healthcare, including vaccine distribution. Ontario government pausing shots holidays last month likely cost lives. claimed couldn‚Äôt find sufficient staff willing work days - doctors nurses volunteering left right centre. last per-capita immunizations compared provinces territories. They‚Äôre prioritizing wrong people (paramedics can‚Äôt get yet, 87-year-old grandfather can‚Äôt get yet, younger hospital higher-ups administrative staff can). understand aren‚Äôt responsible supply, 100 000 vaccines waiting administered weeks beginning year. today 77 000 doses haven‚Äôt completed, received 277 000 doses first place. zero.

They vaccinating people around clock run out. Yes, know issues people wait longer second dose, lengthening time shot 1 shot 2 3 weeks deemed likely safe Health Canada. I‚Äôd happy go get shot 3am Tuesday to. Time everything right now.

The province almost year create vaccination plan shit job. Ford government barely consulted health experts multitude decisions pandemic, including mask mandates lockdown. Decisions took way long made lives lost it. Businesses closing it. blame feds, they‚Äôve done (use available doses), one blame themselves.

These politicians luxury staying harm‚Äôs way (both medically financially), don‚Äôt seem capable empathizing rest us don‚Äôt luxury. It‚Äôs infuriating. ordered 40 million doses Pfizer/Biontech, opposed 100 million Oxford/Astra-Zeneca. Moderna vaccine also approved, rolled yet. total around 300 million doses ordered. slow Pfizer impact UK like has/will rest Europe. Oregon dispatched national guard this, governor told feds extra doses coming. So. words. Driver interstate checks text crashes, send hospital. Alcoholic liver failure, hospital bed them. And, course, literally anyone proven caught COVID due following mask social distancing protocols, kick 'em curb. 

I, one, believe hospitals stick business saving lives instead serving morality arbiters (sorry politicized term, can't think synonym) death panel. also think vaccine distribution plans goal. personally choose go hospital extreme COVID, course, would right.  J&amp;J Oxford/AZ. delighted, knew J&amp;J ready release results next week, first I've seen timeline Oxford/AZ's US arm. approved uptake high, life would mostly normal summertime. makes feel better, enjoyed company either. course not. something entirely different I'm commenting about. actual information released is, people pre-existing conditions may severe complications risks common side effects may life threatening. vaccine killed them, failing health withstand side-effects.  People think vaccines makes 100% unable get infected. They're wrong. difference Japan full respectful Japanese people pride good citizens. 

CA couldn‚Äôt that. saying July impossible  Another one compares teachers (who don‚Äôt work home) communities whole, many work home.

The relevant comparison teachers group ‚Äúother adults don‚Äôt work home‚Äù.

It‚Äôs possible teachers community actually higher rates infection also comparison, paper doesn‚Äôt say. \*Third worst. way could badly enough qualify second worst modern times, W thank that. appreciate clowning guy that‚Äôs hopefully better tomorrow. Covid caused much stress hate party‚Äôs rioted. Hate made people delusional. open minded look sides, empathy take time understand side feels strongly. Look Thanos, big bad guy, avengers would‚Äôve taken time understand trying wipe half population, could‚Äôve collaborated helped eachother out. Don‚Äôt write side slapping label like ‚Äúracist‚Äù ‚Äúunamerican‚Äù people hopes fears lately fear taken spectrometer? Heroin users Bay Area could permitted inject themselves. would free medical staff resources. Well done. Came call J&amp;J vaccine game changer beat it. Still waiting efficacy results though. saying, I‚Äôd rather get two shot vaccine 95% effective one shot vaccine is, say, 70% effective. know arrive conclusion responding thread someone working vaccination center tells specifically running fully capacity due availability issues vaccine. curious, reason compare figures illustrate quickly vaccine rolled out? Oh, also LED ones work fake Amazon. resin curing ones SUPPOSED UVA UVB sterilize, trust UVC safeguards bad.

I actually small sample early UVC LEDs hand confirm work advertised, new ones last longer stronger (so lower exposure time). Can't good news around huh! part it. Behavior also plays role. cases get high people get scared stop things.

No matter cause vaccines think last big peak. trending here. fully agree Can‚Äôt wait get lockdown mid February , still tier 4 tho :( Ah, yep. known one. Thank kind words new reading material. I‚Äôm starting one addiction war drugs. figure I‚Äôll ease one mental illness. make fun winter, eh? mention r/unitedkingdom r/ukpolitics  Yep. 12 weeks government working months later, three-quarters struggling problems like fatigue, depression diminished lung function.

Long term health issues even covid free. main question MANY vials federal government pre-order? Supply bottleneck kind mass rollout under-65's. would even partnering J&amp;J expand pharma factories tax-payer expense. need go Warp Speed delivering shots new contagious variants emerging. Exbrit. Many experts said yes will. 

The current plan best bet, they‚Äôre better half vaccinating 15,000,000 fully vaccinating half many. Hopefully Oxford vaccine fully rolled improve things general Early response shitty places. equal parts happy terrified everyone started banning US citizens traveling countries (except Jamaica, Caymens, etc give fuck long tourist money dry up)...

J&amp;J production issues... game changer mass produce April. then, we'll getting new South African strain... don‚Äôt think anybody wants go bud. overwhelming negative news makes many people pessimistic, understandable. German politicians fucking usual Firstly, COVID-19 hospitalisation associated increased risk readmission death following discharge,relative individuals similar demographic clinical profiles period; nearly third people post COVID-19 hospital discharge re-admitted 1 10died. 


Secondly, rates post-discharge multi-organ dysfunction elevated individuals withCOVID-19 compared matched control group, suggesting extrapulmonary pathophysiology. Diabetes MACE particularly common, considering post-discharge events(which may reflect combination new-onset cases exasperation pre-existing conditions) incident cases. 


Finally, absolute risk post-discharge adverse events greater individuals aged ‚â•70 years than&lt;70 years, individuals White ethnic background Non-White group. However, contrasted background rates adverse events might expected occur groups general population, younger ethnic minority individuals faced greater relative risks aged ‚â•70 years White group, respectively. Either way goes, nobody going restricting summer. Garlic one me. case 7 months ago, you‚Äôre probably long haul, say it‚Äôs gotten less dominant time, especially coffee.

Hopefully Irish Canadians improve vaccination rates travel opens up! Thanks, interesting read. thanks actually providing information unlike every unhelpful commenter. There's possibility Brewdog Pubs Scotland going opened vaccination centres, could actually get pint time lol thought staying on-topic talking LED-based ones traditionally used cure resins. Thanks. I'll ask physician! ok, I'm possibly verge waffling.. thinking thus:

Herd would seem basically, over. Hurrah. Big party. Even around, tending go away matter do, basically over.

Before then, well think large scale lockdowns disappear anyway, far see UK government policy minimise lockdowns restrictions, time threatens overwhelm healthcare, bam. lockdown, rollout progresses tiers reduce, likely maintain framework herd reached.

I agree 'don't want take group'. choice consequences.

For 3rd group, yep basically stay home, whatever measures, herd met, 

Hence interest might take get herd. course like france (46% unwilling potentially) might issue. UK 79% seems pretty respectable. Looking wikipedia, seems 60-75% point. covid vaccine injected muscle tissue (not bloodstream) it'll feel like someone playing darts matter sticks you. Plague Inc. Madagascar closes borders game end.  condolences.

I miss old me. multiple centers count mass vaccination ones

Source: took 98 year old Grandmother get Jab local exhibition center today could quite easily make argument fat people. bad decisions rewarded?

At end day, reducing hospital patients quickly possible. vaccinating risk people first best way goal regardless reason *why* they're risk. lol explain hard hit states getting slammed  Except west coast issues too. California administered 28%. WA 34%. Meanwhile, Texas administered 50%, 1M doses. 

Gonna go limb say current problems administering vaccines political. 0 risk. major factor growth ""gig economy"" which, Europe USA, tries circumvent standard employment system associated social benefits / employee rights. And, course, poor people ones work gig jobs less protections.

Also, UK tends different mainland Europe, generally whenever there's substantial difference USA Europe, UK somewhere inbetween closer USA. really zero effect days protection hard prove since anyone getting sick time may may bad case ... possibly know? Yellow 5, corn syrup, baby parts stop upping age retirement full benefits? Ahh gotcha! Sorry, misunderstood statement haha. Yes, agree still people taking precautions, feel right them, definitely should. Nobody judge people personal decisions. India, Brazil, Indonesia Florida done well! express reliable source news. Hence it‚Äôs dismissed. 

I trust JCVI members rag Yes, thats really stood article, eye-opening. can't even get right now, expect least couple months. I'm concerned choice. Good Lol entire family NJ vaccinated, yet South Carolina, teacher still can‚Äôt get one. state going much slower? Agreed. However, think science illiterate health department administrator helm one. norm work managers directors. necessary skills many health bureaucrats. economy fucked either way. better push hard now. Get cases far possible vaccinating many people possible open properly. current vaccination rates deaths avoided March. go hard lockdown one last time never need lock goes show pass laws want, people still die stupidity. virus retreating 30 50 states moment. 


I think vaccinations yet, still little early making presence felt. probably 1) we're past holidays 2) We've infected ton people last months, accumulating population immunity driving transmission rates  complete fiction someone Facebook made up. microchips small enough injected people track kill people. bunch nonsense, like people think Earth flat. much fewer patience lockdowns developing countries moment.  Call cynical US waiting story says ""reserve vaccines"" sold profit looked data 

Always good idea.

A lot people social media, especially reddit, bash US matter principle assume worse Europe without evidence. posts tend get upvoted appeal pre-existing prejudices signal correct virtues.

The reality US done vaccinations total country Earth, 5th 200 per capita terms: beaten Britain small, rich countries Middle East.  percentage population need vaccinated herd immunity.

That‚Äôs new infectious variant emerged.  Huzzah! still feel like next 2 years going rocky though, UK set recession likes seen 300 years. Maaaaybe. International travel might one last things resolved. hard predict something specific. No, CDC exactly reliable moment. messed beginning. Unfortunate optimism get us mess. Feliz :) little tired articles studies people. news Norway 23 people. 2 million deaths Covid worldwide 40 million vaccinations. think pause little drawing conclusions 23 people. smokers pay higher premium than? 

It's mental gymnastics. Smokers singled this, why? obese people, heavy drinkers, etc better off?

No.

Do pay insurance marketplace?

No.

The ACA lets insurers charge smokers more, even though hardly Americans unhealthy habits. 

I want charged less anyone else. welcome america! shame actually bribe people. Europe continent, country. Yeah, that's also mismanagement, money. states left fund things federal government footing bill for. Florida prime example state governments cannot given full control. PCR tests pretty unreliable symptom onset, cannot rule possibility still incubation, reliability improve 90% 0-4 days symptom onset. ""The highest percentage virus detection nasopharyngeal sampling 0 4‚Äâdays post-symptom onset 89% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83 93) "" No, going normal like illness. Tories done well since 2015 came power.

I‚Äôll wait. i've said hundred times past 9 months- people walking cloud death rly lol country. hard finally got world first Number new cases per 100M people.
And schools Open, sky limit countries rich enough procure vaccines quickly ! India, first person vaccinated 16th Jan ! $50 million per dose? Look like odds dying covid likely higher, sound morbid. says that's rebuttal. Read article, research sources - there's myriad articles various publications covering exact thing. 

Simply dismissing something comes one media company peak brainlet.

Is [British medical multiple sources bottom article 'saying enough' you? early tell UK, Israel reporting 50% drop infections 14 days within vaccinated happened choose worst possible time recent history start long distance relationship. 

Same, brother, although mine international. I'm guessing person one lucky Asian countries that's quarantining incoming travelers? Didn‚Äôt realise process slow states! 

Why would AP clerk giveaway? problem supply money. That's jumping line damaging. Eventually, distribution catch supply. already happening states. Since government control production (we'll see defense production act tho), paying government increase production useless. Money issue distribution end much unorganized.

The people can't afford pay also ones risk. also cannot afford top care become ill. truly make difference, need focus people, rich people afford isolate. porous lockdown everyone goes work, meets friends home, goes crowded subway crowded supermarkets? deaths per capita Sweden? Oh, effective.  Time take smoking now, guess. Oh definitely saying holding back everyone else. explaining definitely case ""no one restricting summer"", fear people judge choose still take precautions without knowing whole situation. God's shackled bounds human connection. God works people work, work end day good work. important? Ah, that's brits saw firm one narrative, tested much. Like, argument, voice this. felt weird. turns brainwashed propaganda system. ? see US pretty much track 200k cases per day vs 800k+ vaccinations per day. plan second doses administered 12 week mark I'd insulted Englishman enjoyed company. people essentially vegetables. Basically countries tracking vaccine side effects closely, I‚Äôm sure think Norway one? That's new information. known vulnerable group 65 comorbidities.

The question *how* going isolate people everyone else, everyone else them. That's feasibly doable. said it.Rich Fuckers would cut line get vaccine first. virus seriously fascinating, ungodly scary. indeed confirm Quit rewarding bad behavior. Make mandatory don‚Äôt comply, fire them! understand media thinks responsible ask random doctors give anecdotes actual scientific studies long-term effects lungs pursued. No. 80% immunity means. every 100 people get virus unvaccinated population. 20 would get equal sized vaccinated population. numbers add quickly exponential growth. think we'll start seeing real effects vaccination Feb. Right numbers declining way spring summer spikes declined hit certain peak. good news hopefully see vaccine start influence case numbers mean another spike like first three again.  know could finish delivery 300 million? don‚Äôt put past current administration screw order well. 250-300x Norway crazy crazy talented. leonard cohen beatles denounced work albums, listener love grateful always sound like that.

Government-controlled facility location monitoring filled certain people broke laws deemed 'an issue' they're also allowed leave monitored officials sounds fucking exactly like camp.

Sounds exactly like jail/prison. know, place people end consequence breaking law. call jails prisons ""camps"" too? Sorry stated, I'm USA. *Edit - although AP clerk dead giveaway Yes, married man family spending time them, would one thing. well, checked numbers worldometer Germany 2% infected per confirmed test. underestimate, would base estimate on? bad vaccine kids ready. Would make feel better mother access entire countries vaccination lists knows many done total? proper leadership helm. Instead, toxic leadership helm. Hopefully that's going change soon. Hi, mods. Yeah agree, I‚Äôd interested see Israel‚Äôs data vaccinated 25% population now. I‚Äôm surprised took January 17th first Brazilian vaccinated Good god, imagine Covid disease, human enemy. big gang murderous thugs that, kill, kidnap torture ransom fun. victims Stockholm syndrome them.

Then again, victims Stockholmed worse. Nothing life 100%, yes, get negative test seven days exposure, negative. one first things thought heard cause loss smell. woke hour going bed one night strong smell smoldering. Traced dehumidifier running basement hot touch. could woken flames smoke detector instead smoldering odor much bigger problem! 

I also think dangers able smell natural gas food that‚Äôs gone bad. said ‚Äòit takes hour get shot‚Äô

That‚Äôs true majority nurses need maybe bit scrutinized professional careers. Especially reasoning includes blatant misinformation- vaccine studied 45 people. Even phase 2 approved vaccines larger that.

At least, made sure positions dispense medical advice. also sessions properly educate vaccine, vaccines general, seem getting information incorrect sources. likely end vaccine. basically intended salvage Mediterranean countries' tourism-dependent economies. Spain Greece particular heavily hit. I'm completely baffled getting upset think way desperate.

Going chain comments said solution speed rollout Tories spending money. pointed speed rollout nothing Tories spending money. said NHS. fact point making. contradicts original point solution Tories spending money. It‚Äôll much harder reach herd immunity 80% effective vaccine (assuming lot people won‚Äôt actually get it). haven‚Äôt got you. They‚Äôre looking get rid close end life doses. Many elderly people can‚Äôt rock doctors surgery last minute. Many carers need help transport needs know number vaccinated also informed 86% UK present symptoms, yes DETECTED key word here. confused actual rates covid would imagine according NY times article:[employers mandate another source?  think liability issue. Prisoners care state. bunch inmates dying Covid preventative measures, lot law suits hands. vaccines hand Wednesday around 2,000 doses. idea doses coming stated reserves.

It's hiccup, full stop vaccination. scrounge 700 doses pulling rural providers already promised doses to. doubt true: statistics frequently used argue need restrictions businesses risks.

Spread may happen effectively home-- unless one assumes virus self-generates within home without introduced outside home, source infection outside home. easily spread person person within home, people almost assuredly gathered close proximity long periods. say liberal conservative. making way.

They rage policies designed lessen covid. 

Democrats typically opposite, though always (fucking Gavin Newsom). 

When someone stupid things gets harmed promoting stupid thing did, zero sympathy. someone protect others stupid thing still afflicted it, full sympathy. There's huge difference there.  Florida's release looks like people waiting line PS5. Ha, advocate actually got info from. Second doses still flowing in, meaning patients still able get required second shot, officials Ochsner continue use doses hand vaccinate people Wednesday. Thursday following Monday, Ochsner CEO Warner Thomas said patients scheduled vaccinations told appointments postponed.

Basically it‚Äôs hiccup ideal. Things still getting better.

This undermines point, assure white hicks also taking seriously, yet live often.

I use term lovingly someone lives hickdom. Last checked recorded 4000 variants know of, them, 2 show evidence increased transmission, namely D614G variant B117 variant (commonly called European variant UK variant), exactly 1 shown affect antibodies (the mink variant), reducing effectiveness 15%, affect B cells, scientists said concern vaccines.

So empirically speaking odds new variant problem 3 4,000. turn problem, Pfizer said update vaccine 6 weeks, Moderna Oxford said believe updated vaccines would need lengthy phase 3 trials again. shows NHS+army effective private test &amp; trace. I'm confused. 5G separate microchip 5G microchip? Like one? Pretty much sentence spoken american ends word trump Okay, total garbage.

1. selection countries analyze appears almost completely arbitrary there's almost discussion chose ones did.
2. analysis based case numbers March early April countries still limited testing capability. countries looks like 3 weeks data.
3. seem assume measure effective based whether almost immediate effect, resulting nonsensical results like international travel ban one effective things Netherlands did, counterproductive Germany. work-from-home school closures extremely effective Iran, effective US. 

I find extremely difficult believe could hope deconvolute effect 11 policies implemented short time span. wish would stop getting upvoted whole story  don‚Äôt think media favours.

We America freedom press. means even shitty media rights good media. unavoidable. Honestly keeping distance coughing/sneezing people would suffice. Still, ordered vaccines started distributing still part EU every regulation law still followed - meaning every EU country could done same. Dude there‚Äôs millions doses Pfizer waiting told send course could know audience. Saying ‚Äúyeah, US partying Canada still shopping vaccines‚Äù would cause riots Canada. ""one hospital system"" largest provider care entire state. Ochsner Health said new doses canceled thousands appointments. recommended travel another state Source:  also get carbon monoxide detectors, alert CO building house. mean Australia outside Victoria lockdown far lighter basically whole Western world?

Can't actually find information either way current vaccinations, although they've order 40m Pfizer, 100m AstraZeneca time get upset priorities month ago. bullshit ""who deserves more"" reason vaccines used **at all.** 

Enough pearl clutching bullshit already pump vaccines. That's matters anymore. goal 100 million people 50 million people (with two shots each)? I've seen Biden specifically say latter, couple months ago think, I've seen number news articles say former recently. realize US seeing similar numbers US right? see somewhere 200K range day cases vaccinating 800k day number vaccinations increases day. UK govt calling China virus officially named? never saw it, fact don‚Äôt remember ever using moniker. don‚Äôt think ever ok, definitely official name.

This mean think means.  feds bungled things, fact Trump administration far out-paced EU embarrassing EU.  U.S. access billions different vaccines they're produced.  never large ""reserve"". Vaccines expiration dates, need stored particular manner.  don‚Äôt really believe that. make similar it‚Äôs food wild. real life example mushrooms. forage mushrooms I‚Äôve eaten 70 species. species extremely hard grow like indigo milk caps.

The truth is, foods complex give credit. Further, foods species vary drastically nutrient content depending soil else growing area. It‚Äôs also lot energy make synthetic food matter doesn‚Äôt come nowhere. I‚Äôm skeptical. US millions vaccine doses go waste

Could please cite sources this? can't find anything supports high number.

Regardless, I'm arguing America sort flawless bastion vaccination (obviously isn't) country comparable size larger. Correct! Pretty awesome seeing Salisbury cathedral top there. Walked past yesterday, amazing seeing places like used vaccination sites.   either trying characterize comment ‚Äúgood‚Äù ‚Äúbad‚Äù? concerned get vaccine lol. I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt let negative news Covid ruin mood, way much negativity world, need positivity, Ik hard try think we‚Äôll normal summer ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù could still identified early mid 2022. Worth noting pandemic global term well airlines assured us flying absolutely safe /s Weird literally whole family Pfizer second jabs booked in. *cries USA* that's protests about. Um yeah, that's me. Oh, neat. That's pretty relieving. Let's keep up! mean? exact opposite saying. *cries American* Yeah that's point though. thought implicit AppArEntly enough sufficiently passive agressive. 140 per minute seem crazy me. actually distributed administered mass scale is. Seems like American take, that's bad thing given bad smoking is.

It's smoking outside America (i.e. Europe) far commonplace far less castigated. Im sure starting smoking friends getting hooked nicotine necessarily indicative mental health issues.  Food poisoning comes food contaminated virus bacteria. can't necessarily taste without covid.  ""camps"". place people brought put surveillance refuse follow mandatory home quarantine orders test positive. 

The fuck definition camp?

Thank reply ain't vaccine It‚Äôs competence, yes. even more, it‚Äôs interest actually helping country actively sabotaging it.  Yes. picture shows (theoretical) relative risk close groups compared distance. sure makes sense risk exposure higher tight crowd distance risk still high. 
From infectious stand point would course encourage protests people really calling non-mask wearers idiots. effects mask wearing mostly theoretical. amount litter damage environment mask using causing enormous, clear benefit. talking billions masks every day.

But sure, keep wearing mask take walk outside. enjoy fresh air.  Hot AC, yep. winter surge essentially proves imo. Also places saw big summer weather surges AC use highest - southern US basically. see winter surge summer numbers pretty tame, things considered. think tool, can't blame hammer screws. tools, know translate language, like,m ""if X years, expected live Y, X+10 years, expected live Y+2 years"".
It's tool used determine survivor benefits, retirement estimates. Sputnik (and Satellite) means companion, fellow Okay, quarantine hospitals help current ICU availability, would also require staffing. Ok let rephrase mean is: know many people received first doses 21 days ago also received 2nd dose?  Everyone vaccinated right second appointment 12 weeks, 21 days longer standard. quite frank, amount information do

Either way stuff like this, mild reactions expected. see business ‚Äòold school‚Äô mentality. negotiating, measure extreme taken table. ‚ÄòBeing tough‚Äô approach works hold power. 

It doesn‚Äôt work side strong position wait everyone realise threats empty. 

We new director, thought could bully main vendor line business application threatening leave another supplier ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt shape up‚Äô

He‚Äôd neglected briefing told current vendor best small field, wouldn‚Äôt move internal staff new software, we‚Äôd retrain staff, rebuild integrations, redeploy new software clients, retrain use software suppliers weren‚Äôt using. 

Basically go back original vendor tail legs try rebuild partnership 20 years making. didn‚Äôt last another 6 months. Furlough shitshow they've repeatedly patched people pointed massive gaps left people changed jobs etc.

Business support patchy hell. business great, others nothing. friend mine closed business he's run cash - much sniff grant loan. many countries similarly fast. started weeks later. 

Germany example vaccinates people five times rate new infections moment. good luck current hospital ICU availability welcome cencorship! conspiracy theorist. literally see vaccine given population size per state, governor passed counties jab. plenty people sixty five can't get it. agree get vaccinate people much states out.

And anybody drive Florida 65 get it. Even people Canada flying though. know US *millions* vaccine doses go waste, right? ability administer it‚Äôs complete failing administration actually distributing can(theoretically moment) produce proteins, vitamins etc synthetically, combine synthetic foodstuffs, clone animal/plant cells make foid synthetically. energy efficient yet, could solve problems point, long People want To. way could phase actual animal products, whole still keeping simulated substitute. thats far future. Canada pay much Israel did? Israel put serious premium large amount delivered early possible. tried Wellbutrin surprised find crying middle haircut! Tears dropping onto salon robe thing like ""Whoa, what's that? Really? I'm crying? Why?"". Pretty messed up. iam sure wont take long  Okay admit know . 

So reason reactions? people allergic? read somewhere people allergies certain drugs undergo vaccination Covishield

How many bad flu cause? See 1918...

The symptoms similar... it‚Äôs new, vaccine. way it‚Äôs kind bad new flu... great news. Hopefully get shit together soon.

You're likely die falling bed eaten shark... surfer, much

In case general population statistically higher chance vaccine virus... 30 priority group (healthcare worker etc) much likely get virus

That necessarily bad thing, I'm pointing sorts statistics essentially nonsensical depend factors Nah say that. Fatalities Norway came large subset people unfortunately terminally ill weak immune system. vaccine gives headaches nausea normal people headaches life threatening aforementioned subset. challenging health care provider policy makers work hand hand figure best course action time side. Plus don‚Äôt enough field data backup hypothesis. condolences ones suffered. let‚Äôs please take story context spread like wild fire. Next thing know people burned labs not. Smokers higher healthcare costs lifetime. 

The cost treating respiratory conditions cancers offset cost end life care people live longer. 

If government wants encourage quit ban it, way.  realize dude risk levels vaccinated literally becomes another flu medical level Indoor dining sounds like awful idea, massive house parties sound worse.

If truly trade I‚Äôd go dining.

Then it‚Äôs wide open live.

Well except hospitals, divert ICU‚Äôs full.

But hey that‚Äôs freedom something.

Personal responsibility ass. Yup. 100% true. insightful. Hope get second ahot 12 weeks. However, little concerned limited efficacy one shot given. read graph correctly &lt; 70% versus 37% placebo group. two 95%. everything Reddit US. There's really great recent episode frontline documents rather well also. West Virginia also one two original states allows medical exemptions kids vaccinated schools. They‚Äôre definitely right side vaccinations.  non english speaker, think vaccine reason 10 died. 10 sick patients, palliative care.  trip interruption insurance may may cover COVID related events. hold breath average traveller prepared. post got information? would like read more! They‚Äôre also one two original states medical exemption vaccines already high rate vaccination too. Something like 3% said they‚Äôll never open mail without precautions again! fuck that! going down, plateau-ing

still progress nonetheless point people often overlooked.

I hate people bring flu deaths etc etc... overwhelm hospitals. thing far infectious flu.

I also hate people bring driving accidents mental illness compared COVID. Totally connected all.

At least accordingly ( [Italy, ) Oh know now? Point Pfizer Moderna study indeed corroborates that. gut feeling kinda thing? really isn‚Äôt point cause literally check major 2001 event country see remember it. I‚Äôm going throw there, isn‚Äôt true every family, kids age older siblings still getting important social interaction home. elementary-age kids gotten super close past year. Speak yourself. Jfc anecdote city here. Ok. 23 deaths 30,000 doses. fatalities aged 80+. statistically significant. Meaning, that‚Äôs normal amount deaths time period even without COVID. It‚Äôs worth thinking about. stupid fucking thing say.

I would rather two people vaccine first jab longer delay, one person it, keep fridge. 

The second jab almost entirely longevity, initial protection.

Here California, sacrificed both. ""If want people drinking bleach, sell it"" basically argument here. Really heartbreaking. people probably feeling bittersweet relief getting jabbed. Whatever research say this, it‚Äôs devastating. think continue lock downs indefinitely?  love common sense, also love numbers lets look some. 
[California: 74,989 cases/million, 845 state): 83,325 cases/million, 1,018 deaths per million. 

So sure, Montana oh 15% cases deaths per million, trade meaningful education kids, much freedom general. went lunch friends today got back community pool, probably going skiing morning. 

There's two important statistic I'd like share, compare CA Montana active &amp; current hospitalizations &amp; Montana peaked month ago, California maybe peaking right now? obviously expect 15% gap shrink coming weeks. We've already given vaccine assisted living facilities, opened everyone 65 last week deaths go down. making case better journalism. never mentioned facts altered. believe responsible pro-social journalism need take account effect titles way present information taken society, especially, based way present information manipulated used misinformation (unintentional) disinformation (intentional). News CNN ESPECIALLY Fox News never take things account generally net negative society, especially 15 news sites reporting information presented differently. responsible journalism compared clickbait cashfactories. agree? criticizing information itself. Where‚Äôs china‚Äôs? Home workouts exist. r/bodyweightfitness. need gym fit.  Someone linked already. I've seen plenty people say it. Specifically body positivity movement. Try taking vitamin D3. known people high levels Vitamin D3 hit hard COVID. bc D3 prevents cytokine storm damages internal organs. Australian states trying eradication, keep close eye sewerage results removing last restrictions. 

I see way MU uses it, it‚Äôs great predictor future hospital demand. good argument restrictions continue indefinitely given number lives save. cons come ways solve. WVs system could‚Äôve scaled state size California. Opted federal program limits CVS Walgreens gives opportunity pharmacies state already affiliations LTC facilities national guard charge distribution instead hospitals. vaccines already designated going, distributing administering ever got here. I‚Äôve already gotten second dose 10 days ago West Virginia goes, goes nation. only. Every state around putting teachers high priority. state. bit confusing previous poster saying people BORN 1995, would middle school-- ~2007 beyond--when smart phones social media starting really take off. people getting vaccinated = less need lockdowns. Chicken egg situation people get vaccine pointless continued lockdowns countries open enough people gotten vaccine. course makes sense.

This first vaccines ever made.

Prof Sir John Bell, regius professor medicine University Oxford agrees (or vice versa).

So think know better him... bearing mind we're literally posting comments article says thing, fool you. Ever heard body positivity movement?   also worth noting infected covid 19 unvaccinated actually far, far riskier vaccine itself. Wait joking? comments pretty funny though.

Is Reddit little bit sensitive? lot places also difficulty getting enough subs teachers sick. already sub shortage state Covid. pool available subs even smaller now. It‚Äôs one reasons schools area closed November. Okay truth. Like get add tents outside hospital temporarily increases capacity. However taking angle? evidence capacity shrunk assume graph telling us. plateaued. Btw happening every region USA whole...not LA it‚Äôs crazy conclusion That's head sand ever I've seen one. MRNA delivery going game changer going forward viral treatments burden proof   person making claim, matter ""obvious."" saw news mean everyone did, mean person asking proof troll otherwise asking bad faith.

I cannot upvote enough sadly awards give. get tired Person making wild arguments telling people research Person A's argument see valid. spent four years competitive speech debate college tend drop argument since can't tell judge opponent failed provide source claims disregarded. what? mRNA producers already said tweak vaccine new strain 6 weeks, vaccine cleared also safety trials need rigor released time frame quicker Flu vaccines, right focus vaccinations would stupid tweak vaccine middle mass vaccination new variant popped seen thousands since beginning pandemic. vaccine tweaked need basis right isnt time. Please call STIs, need stigmatize Interesting, thanks believe second pretty telling bad US handled things pandemic, life expectancies already low considering rich advanced country is. comparable poor nations first world countries. Given factor numbers probably bad covid first world countries people live longer.  Ye. downside much less social interaction. upside im introvert doesnt care lol. guess ""really"". infection rate nearly bad Spanish Flu - 10 million people live LA, 3 million people got virus, means 30% people got virus. Spanish flu infection rate around 33%. 

Even kills significantly less, still staggering amount. high school kids' teachers often call millennials. 16yos class pointed out--to horror math teacher--that millennial, them. even born then. thought 2 weeks 2nd shot? they've tested, especially claims 1 3 LA virus. Japanese bullet trains...honestly American interstate system STILL incredible. land plane throughout country USA trucking logistics insane. There‚Äôs sexy urban mass transit much Asia USA interstate system still pretty incredible would say, shut fucking farms either way   Luck definitely plays major role.

I read story woman infected getting haircut son front open window... meanwhile, went funeral hug shake hands 200 people managed fine. interesting thing note social distancing mask usage flu numbers dramatically reduced year. Started Southern Hemisphere past summer continued ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù may smart people wear masks aren‚Äôt feeling well keep distance people. Edit: flu fly Sounds like great time play guitar smoke lot pot Oh dang guess becuz internet discourse make claims back leave others discern whether true.

Oh wait, that's exactly got us disinformation cesspool. Make claim everyone favor citing volumes counter spread disinformation encourage good discussion argument Probably give shit. definition western generations hinges childhood experiences Americans exclusively, yeah, point. 

Lorenzo born Siena 1993 still millennial even though playing legos room parents watched news 9/11 know really teens access information though, dosing regimen one suggested could short time. 

There's need us individuals cling onto idea world's greatest experts think to.

The consensus among experts makes sense.

People disagree allowing fixated data point know.  Lol relax. Find ways work life work. I‚Äôm grind mode working business don‚Äôt mind going said makes sense. Unless clinical trials conducted test efficacy different dosing regimens specific vaccines, sane scientific individual would recommend anything besides given dosing regimen. 

It scientifically irresponsible idiotic anything besides scientifically proven.

Science gave us vaccines, take way science says take them. way politicians want take them. Curbside cost Instead they‚Äôve closed gyms ordered people sit house Nah, stupidity created devil stupid admit they‚Äôre stupid, needed something blame. aren‚Äôt going two sets rules regardless. 

The reason ‚Äúsaying this‚Äù bc studies vaccines aim solve question data yet regarding transmission. idea who's downvoting lol, love makeup anymore. mask sunglasses I'm good go! anyone explain Covid Vaccine distribution numbers governors match CDC says?

For example, CDC says 1.8M vaccines distributed NY. also says 2.1M vaccines distributed governor says 934,925 vaccines distributed. governor says distributed 1.5M vaccines. talking  yet workers won‚Äôt get MONTHS  LA metro area 13 million people. Covid-19 averages weeks incubation-infection-recovery. LA hit 1 million cases, years LA reaches herd immunity own.

""partial"" technically correct, might mislead others here. think running 20% hospitals specific subset people use means dictate pricing 80% plus 100% businesses hospitals? capitalistic, like said, government cannot suggesting. understand... people *tired virus*.

It's like advertising, goes away stop paying attention it! fucking deserve think people forget lots older people independent STILL work may reliable friends family count on. Hang there! anyone wondering Hitler got support people, people like give crazy dictators powers   Looking curves, new case numbers steadily decreasing India past months (&lt;20k daily cases). wondering kind measures put place happen? husband laughed time wearing pirate eye patch bed eye could stay freaking closed lol. Asshole. Exactly, sub full hypocrites. Tons people criticize antimask crowd yet still friend amd family gatherings. That's right that's what's happening. Yeahhh almost like emergency preventative measures put place prevent collapse actually work bring infections down, let new wave comes in. That's keep hearing this.

Honestly, look data UK. Total hospitilizations almost double first wave peak. bad. One cool thing announced moderna developing mRNA flu vaccines. believe advantage mRNA capability bring vaccine online quicker traditional method. theory could put multiple variant vaccines flu season would increase protection. materialize take years regulators feel comfortable signing new vaccines diff strains untested. Worst case scenario new strain appears create vaccine 30k trial within 2 months able mass market; fast track EUA basically.

Still future bright. douchebag. Fancy! state. can‚Äôt even find get it.  key scientists talking World Health Organization. would helpful nations' scientists around world would collaborate, Pete's sake. 13 million vaccinated far, country, ok. Employers need get board society needs stop glorifying work sick. job literally get shamed taking time even though supposedly get paid sick leave.

Also, wear mask public everyone achieved optimal immunity unless already feel ill? vaccines double doses.

600,000,000 divided two = 300,000,000. Aus, started yet (will Feb). fortunately handful (in quarantine) cases, buffer time, govt serum labs licenced churn AZ vacc (which currently doing). CA, governor allowing 65+ many counties can't get enough supply (and others can't get shots out). Maybe time roadtrip Oregon... okay nervous it. get nervous every shot get, mostly shot xD I'll getting vaccine like :) Millions vaccinated far adverse effects allergic reactions.  know much they‚Äôre billing for? That‚Äôs BS  Cancer deaths down. J&amp;J also testing see two doses shot improve efficacy. makes far, far sense. Young people far, far, far likely asymptomatic superspreaders, plus fit enough able deal potential vaccine adverse reaction. clear everywhere else crypt keeper policymakers send young people die wars thinking themselves. UK lockdown seema working fine bring UK variant control, despite evidence suggesting people taking measures less seriously March. Cases 19% last 7 days.

 think fears infectiousness may overblown extent. 

See That's people actually tested too. I'm like 90% sure back November, fuck I'm waiting line place could potentially infect it, putting health record potential future health insurance companies reject covid survivors due long-term thing. like anyone anything anyway it.

oh wait It‚Äôs sensational way. Yeah I'd appreciate that... I‚Äôll let know hear anything. know Florida anyone 65+ resident you‚Äôre pretty far away there‚Äôs second shot take account. Immunity start coming 2 weeks vaccination vaccines, believe. couple weeks hitting 50% vaccinated, seeing significant drops daily infection counts. Places prioritising elderly risk people hopefully see dramatic drops death rates well point deaths occur groups.

Realistically think going long slow decline infection rate, hard casually distinguish infection rate dropping due successful lockdowns like. symptomatic spread primary driver.

For CCP shills saying things like ""must foreigners bringing virus like CCP said."" let's take minute realize [China blaming foreigners ills 100 that, ""foreigners it"" excuse China using long predicted tried out. [First Italian French, American, etc. saying incompetent screening foreigners bringing virus.

It's like clockwork, folks. live California. wife mid-40's. little hope we'll get vaccine summer California - completely mobile able willing drive anywhere country chance getting shot earlier, assuming giving jabs non-residents. (if helps, asthma high blood pressure.)

Any ideas? sit tight hope Newsom turns around sinking ship? proactive least temporarily get 3rd world state? 

We willing fly anywhere, drive anywhere. hope friends family get shot soon. wish best. correct Im wrong (most likely am) mean 1/2 people would get positive pcr test actually ability spread COVID-19 since innate immune system dispatched virus. (I would also infer comment 3/4 asymptomatic super spreaders people talk about)  Interesting see almost require 2 doses except J&amp;J. read rate 0.05 0.1 %. higher case rate lower death rate. won‚Äôt know it‚Äôs over.... correlation imply causation right? autopsies confirmed died due vaccine related reactions? remember distinctly reading news one guy dying Oxford vaccine trial, like 2 weeks later news reported given placebo. then, news guy dying done rounds spread damage. 

I bother reading articles want encourage clickbait. 29 people massive number. people dying level, thousands would died worldwide now.. presume, verified 100% news titles would say clickbaity.   seems like putting things perspective. know, upsets sensitive. missed point

Why vaccinate bodies can‚Äôt physically handle it? painful üò£ response 20mn claim.

We put lot hope Astra/Oxford messed trials giving participants half 1st dose. messed claim 20mn vaccinated last year would easily achieved. rookie mistake dominant player.

It sucks waiting another vaccine comes along current rate we're looking 1-1.3mn/day majority people getting vaccinated June. I'm page. went 220 lbs 175 past 8 months. ain't fit really I've dieting occasional exercise look better definitely. Also heavy art getting good illustration/painting hope seen attractive. I've made professional level art game companies think cool hobbys going try date. I‚Äôm going promised could doing. 20 million January 1st laughably behind.

Sure, realize they're promising things order get people react way want. want sit wait patiently vaccinated, decided say vaccinate 10% population per month patiently wait, that's lie told. absolutely way ever reasonable goal, knew that. operating assumption government mandate truth, they're clearly willing lie anything order persuade act way want to. blatant example claims masks working early pandemic, magic flipping guidance ostracize anyone wear mask science denier though unclear science mask wearing March. point also exclusive USA. happening countries. There‚Äôs big difference isolating following guidelines. Everyone latter.  Man, feel close success yet thousands millions idiots standing way.

It makes think devil really exist Words one meaning. Another definition confidence trust, confidence scientific method makes perfect sense. publication linked full description concentration section 13 DESCRIPTION

If extra always donate sell another country covid19 come back bite us right away traveler brought home. US recall news stories local schools shut week someone took kids another country &amp; 1 unvaccinated kids brought home mumps, measles, whooping cough ... Happened often state people got sick &amp; banned religious philosophical objections kids required get vaccinated go school, leaving medical reason refuse. Economic activity slow without lockdowns restrictions. Perhaps severely, it'll slow regardless.

Prior lockdowns, economic stagnation already happening due virus. explain given option getting vaccine? young, presumably reason high list.

For instance, immunocompromised something, that's important variable.

More info needed. Also, probably listen medical advice random redditors.  already years lower developed countries... 2018 (data could rapidly find google) 82 Canada vs 78.5 US. Ahh taking seriously.... wonder why? though maybe rise Zoom won't?

I think ""Zoomer"" anything video-conferencing program. rather think combo Z + Boomer, Generation Z (two gens X, one Millenials) plus numbers equating another Baby Boom contradicts recent article LA times curve slightly flattening. us immune systems produce robust responses vaccines.

So vaccines slow transmission I'm fucked. sub high quality zero amounts misinformation good window get antibody check curious. said schools spread COVID! mean ‚Äòwaste 20s?‚Äô 

COVID represent 1.5 years entire decade. COVID vaccine booster shot it‚Äôs first time body ever seen before. Babies get booster flu shot too. I‚Äôm vaccine designer, doubt booster mRNA flu shot. Complete disregard fact zero indication Vaccines work strain.

More contagious not, vaccine still work still back normal year.   Never forget many people want wantonly slaughter 4,500 people day happiness.

Because exactly fighting lockdowns - cold blooded murder, 4500 times day.

Those anti-maskers anti-lockdown people locked prison away society life. country us want die virus. want infect kill us.

Failing that? Let's split country half build walls keep super spreaders out. go way, go ours. get live get party get sick die. No, know yet. lot studies.

I suspect people lost kidneys covid shorter lifespan though, pretty permanent. really clue lung scarring. strokes heart attacks? things guess about, lung scarring similar ex smoker maybe?  still probably increasing... You‚Äôre ok. take month two get back normal. mid-November starting feel normal again, though I‚Äôm still fatigued easily. virus lasts while. Go slow. Don‚Äôt push yourself. sound funny inside head?

One always existed continue exist everywhere. cause COVID-19 outbreak Two things:

1- article briefly mentioned based modelling method already assumes cases missed. completely flawed.

2- seen analysis done positivity within community, requires measurement input, concentration sewage. described method uses guess work.

ps offense fellow Redditors India, I'll never get used way using ""till"" place ""until"" formal writing. I'm guessing internal control. COVID PCR works way medical PCR diagnostic, show sample collected properly increase probability result false negative. One reasons flu vaccines efficacy rates 50% it‚Äôs guessing game flu strains around vaccines go development. covid knew exactly virus looked like. Fun fact CVS giving shots assisted living places says need covid shots every year like flu shots...

 bottom)

### vaccine need given annually?

Current science suggests COVID-19 vaccine like flu vaccine, requiring annual dosing, research required fully answer question. They‚Äôre allowing students/families opt online learning. Also restaurants may open economic data suggests foot traffic still significantly lower pre-covid levels. Easy get states now. Well Oregon. People like make sub worth reading. One leading fun facts conspiracy theorists major vaccine manufacturers able held liable potential side effects. Me. high school lucky enough parents still work throughout whole pandemic. also many hobbies coronavirus didn‚Äôt effect.   Guess i‚Äôll keep windows open day two get back afterwards lol Thanks! vaccine, *far* less likely infect anyone else happen get infected. body fight effectively quickly.

Herd immunity absolute, either. magical situation nobody ever gets sick, virus live animals always around. comes statistics probability stopping outbreaks occurring. someone gets sick, spread around enough people immune/vaccinated. Last century lot people suffered black lung. century lot people suffer Covid lung? GAVI Global Alliance Vaccines &amp; Immunization says 19 viral vector vaccines development:

**There four types COVID-19 vaccines: here‚Äôs Yeah want live die coronavirus whenever step out.

You want us lay die. deal inconvenience shutdowns. 4,500 Americans day lose lives never able anything more.

Problem refuse die refuse back you. reckoning lives people taken. Fools! best knowledge period educate make decisions trust. much faith medical community, honest person chronic health ailment life. educate arm much knowledge possible. medical community throw drugs people instead treating root. give statement health benefits outweigh risks. personal experience, risks worst condition treating. agree one must educate arrive conclusion.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

They're going magic cure whip Everybody else vaccines too. missing point. Vaccines protect us, necessarily people vaccinated. means need vaccine (or least people want around) want get back normal. article stated 30,000 tests conducted flu season far. There's seven positives, attributed vaccinations rather actual flu. care elaborate? Honest question, don‚Äôt mean seem like asshole anything vaccinate terminally ill? 

It‚Äôs even fact die soon peoples immune systems tend extremely weak. Even mild vaccine side effects harmful them.

That goes people extremely, extremely frail well. headache, chills nausea could serious consequences them. guess could get professional opinion getting one see healthy enough.

What else would want do? title misleading. ice cream domestic market, contamination found local authority. Nothing US, sure fox news made title.  start worldwide pandemic. Lest forget that. whole shit started Wuhan, China. School employee totally agree. 
Social interaction virtual learning enough, either, but, like said, kids learning offline. 
Plus, REALLY hard tell much actually learning see kid looking off-camera, answer there. probably is. Super well-intentioned parents making harder kids learn giving little much help, unfortunately.

Some kids AWESOME online school, really exception rule, we're honest.


And say knowing school actually ridiculously well keeping kids learning engaged, contact parents frequently check kids(at least do, special education).

Also, aside class time, teachers small pods meet twice week. think like... 7 8 kids per group? learn, also fun activities kids interaction teachers.

But schools stuff like also exception. seen release policy based number 46 aren't. false dichotomy. Poor logic reasoning. suicides no? larger picture *we know*. one would rather find out. Let's eliminate thing can. Sorry 1996 millennial. definitely act relate Gen Z Definitely agree. think vital better equip citizens skills education system.

I agree something, buildings kinda shitty bc mention, sell apartment without nothing, without even floor, one continue it. also exterior part apartment, like entrance, stairs that, first time saw hell im getting into, country would like slum low class house project. enter apartment wow, different story. lived chinese uni campus, rented outside also went see housing projects curiosity.

The media promoting fatness. literally saying fat people exist right model want. Fat people buy stuff know want ads people like them. upset wank material changed. Poor baby. 

Healthy every size campaign accepting bodies promoting healthier lifestyles choices instead chasing number scale. glorifying anything. bigot. 

Education work? force people eat want? fat shamers sound like people want deny others freedoms like lol wonder... ;) Oh that's silly lol, thanks guess.

I honestly mean get political here. Jusr covid ""policies"" seem always 100 something... Submitted /r/Angryupvote people age range likely die covid also take hospital beds.

I'll add link second, looks like Covid19 infection 99% effective preventing reinfections least 7 months. That's effective current Tbh get reference I've gotten 24 hour sniffles couple times, I'm getting somehow. guess better.  We'll keep mind 'infection control protocol' 100% fail proof. national statistic average - many people are't dying, means losing lot year.

It's voodoo curse - fairly frequently fatal pandemic... I‚Äôd love see source, thanks. saying true, excess death vs corona deaths comparisons countries still clearly puts UK bad position. unique situation regards counting deaths. can't speak countries, Canada least respective values yesterday (Jan. 15) ~6,800 new positive cases ~48,200 new injections.

I spent month prospecting working government contractor help replace outgoing engineering team basically nuked codebase stereotypical nightmare developers everyone warns hiring.

This contractor pain work -- unpaid meetings, unrealistic expectations, expected literally full-time employee wanting bill small slices per-feature basis. fired first invoice pushed back ""audacity"" bill unreasonably high number useless daily calls forced me.

Short situations like USDS 18F, governments build software instead contract shops like shitshow dealt with. They're nontechnical, ""traditional"" consulting shops think still bring value world dictating needs done without bothering understand technical complexity demanding pay least amount realistically get away with. They're outdated boomer shops I'm glad longer deal shit. billable rate worth headache.

This failure governments unable move away shitty race-to-the-bottom contracting model. youngster might still think that. someone little older, I'd rather trade literally losing year life able go pub year. No. We‚Äôre going worst right now. We‚Äôll rounding corner summer.

Shows really matters country. turned fat many words insult USA rest world look like joke anyways 'look americans! thats fat.'. r/UsernameChecksOut  Health every size movement accepting working HEALTH instead weight loss. getting people exercise regularly eat healthier instead focusing numbers mean anything goal.

Studies shown permanent weight loss incredibly difficult. Telling people healthy unless weigh X scientific. hating fat people. scientific accepting body moving towards healthier lifestyle bonus lose weight change shape (more preferable actual health fat reduction important weight loss). 

It's clear know thing exercise/sports medicine.  seems quite likely me. probably still need wear masks (and indoor dining etc great idea, realistically probably allowed), people group develop severe symptoms, worst april.  dont believe mRNA technology I'm certain. knowledge Pandemic documentary Netflix. Good point! know this!   Target trunk rather head virus. heard Gitmo still operating. even convinced respect another theory

Hopefully enough vaccinated loosen rules March /April fingers crossed late summer things normal. Although I'm expecting large crowd gatherings restrictions spring 2022. Money doesnt; grow trees. print money that's devalue currency. Many leaders begun realize cannot keep things closed much longer. What? Cool cool cool.

Especially one, since use weakend form virus rather mRNA. healthcare workers think vaccine dangerous I've talked must failed microbiology something. Asymptomatic? stop believing everything read. lift button managed isolation facility mate... staff member got infected despite never directly interacting infected person. traced back infected person staying managed isolation lift staff member used genome sequencing confirm point transmission. Q: call series super spreader parties busted L.A.?

A: enough super spreader parties busted L.A. possible, say passed holidays (almost people infected Christmas/New Year already showing symptoms now), fact close 25-30% country could already infected vaccinations started significantly ramping up, think good chance passed worst things terms cases. 

Deaths/hospitalizations may lag little longer, think distinct possibility things gradually get better good level April/May. 

Not guarantee people really need hold months i'm starting hopeful. measures, 25% Americans suffer disability, think generalizing category helpful.

Actually, West thought Holocaust Soviet propaganda liberated parts Germany saw evidence themselves, acts oppression Jews, like Crystal Night, underreported Western press.

WWII saving Jews opposing religious oppression. * potentially spreading people make decision. usual, modern medicine (big Pharma) always looks 'cure disease' looking curing 'what causes disease'...

The Virus causes disease, vaccine curing ‚Äúwhat causes disease‚Äù. Although criticism accurate lot big pharma drugs like say, treating symptoms disease.

Vaccines small part ‚Äúbig pharma‚Äù, partly aren‚Äôt profitable precisely cure cause disease. No, quite literally doing. Nearly half dozen times completely argued something made mention of. made strawman, represented words, attacked it. absolute garbage know it. Never call anything killed.

Your teenage years fun, please learn think critically. Afaik everything reading 6 million day march goal Biden admin looking for. may possible ultimate goal. chose reject feds reasonable response decide throw fit social media terrorizing citizens Dude came exact freaking conclusion numbers appear relatively balanced mortality significantly higher men. know think otherwise saying number deaths relatively balanced, death rate. see, thing.  save go vaccinated?

I know prices alluring right now, damn man...so much go wrong save bucks. show sustained immunity 8 months. likely much longer, first SARS generated immunity lasting 12 years. sociopaths ones fine locking year meanwhile ignoring sacrifice. I'll legit happy society pays price coming years. doesn‚Äôt work way.

More less protection less. even Mexico less population COVID response horrible, far far worse US.

As one example. Type II diabetes, 100% preventable. Sad. good reply comment, accept. 

 Always listen, take news, own.

""Don't listen"" defense stupid fear mongering idiots. Australia started imposing bunch tariffs China pandemic Please read paper closely.
The paper say mrNPIs (more restrictive non pharmaceutical interventions) include lockdowns ineffective. Quite opposite. states lrNPIs mrNPIs shown offer significant reduction Covid.
But lrNPIs like go life normal. example countries (S Korea Sweden), lrNPIs include, social distancing, limiting domestic international travel, ban large gatherings, testing, contact tracing isolation infected close contacts. None successful US. since lack discipline implement lrNPIs (anti-maskers), government's tool use mrNPIs.   mean, US citizen land borders two countries significantly lower populations us. cut travel early enough could essentially island nation less. I'm left wondering America went ""number 1!"" ""good enough"". Found legit sociopath. Pretty sure included people antibodies N protein. def don‚Äôt warts dick champ least ensures controlled level resistance. 


And, crucially, know *when* happened. sure infected symptoms positive test. 

The idea would get infected purposefully prevent getting reinfected making head spin. You‚Äôre cherry picking metrics time period. last 7 days, cases down, percent positivity down, hospitalizations down. Hospitalizations always best metric spotting trends don‚Äôt fluctuate wildly like we‚Äôve seen cases holidays. covid positive ones get too? I‚Äôve learned accept tweets satire level something. past ones similar frankly show detachment society. number include Scotland Wales. number going around 360,000 Thats Word mostly used People cant counter argument. lot People suffer Every Day, killed well? applicable t8 animals. is, show live animals, towards ideals. applicable show hatred towards life.  Minor point, Oxford selected vector vaccine that's they've working experience with, trust mRNA WTF. Yeah open restaurants now!

#NOT makes sense vaccinated can‚Äôt spread, guess we‚Äôll get see live study subject. true doofus would say ""I'm going get infected able get reinfected""!

If young, healthy people option living virtually 2020 locked houses, exposed virus poses virtually risk becoming immune it, think majority would choose latter (and have).  I'm Australia dun dun dun dudunnn... dun dun dun dudunn  work school face face rolled dice decided join gym again. Everyone wears masks. Yes people may think I‚Äôm dumb, need mental physical health.

Still though, think proper way go ask source. Quite frankly don‚Äôt want Reddit look like history papers^its^all^citations.  Yeah valid options afford  Strawman. virus poses little risk average young, healthy person gives long-term immunity it.

But point vaccine *prevent infection first place.* Reinfections mild rare, shown study, cares getting reinfected?

Everyone knows testing limitations here, variety reasons underpinning that, limitations mean reported infections numbers always shaky ground.

At stage think that's overly important, however. simply need get need vaccinated soon possibly can. event get risk groups fully vaccinated end April begin get country going save lot lives. meantime, we're caught worst options. half-hearted restrictions merely serve delay date people die strangle economy time: ultimately, really helping anyone medium term, desperately need get right people vaccinated now.

So wrong around repeatedly stated confirmed national shutdown cannot happen matter executive level. courts would throw attempted. states would agree won‚Äôt. Nothing else US shutting again. Phizer said actually doses reserve Almost halfway where? liberal number I've seen 13.7m vaccinated, clear wether that's totally vaccinations distributed (including second doses) total people vaccinated, we're country 350m+. screams Brazilian Yes, 0.12% far.

The state leading way New Jersey, 0.23% population already died Covid.

In Belgium, 0.17% population already died.

We don‚Äôt know exact death rate per case. know well 0.1%... probably close enough 1% use estimate. F***** done. one big clusterfuck. It‚Äôs possible said early days bad, maybe didn‚Äôt try hard recently. I‚Äôd assume areas better others still, though courier services available testing seems like range would extend pretty far. Bhopal study last 1000 volunteers, 26,000 study since November. trial last 1000 independently conducted local Bhopal hospital Vaccine maker can't anything it.

Vaccine make can't anything?

How get vaccines then? private entity allowed use vaccine yet complete phase 3 trials? one source reports local hospital. link? 

Even then, lOcAL hOsPiTaL permission administer vaccines top asking consent people?

Wtf. given government lied many doses actually had, gonna push back dates normies start getting vaccinations? J&amp;J‚Äôs production numbers *massive* let point game considering antibody titers take long develop. expecting billion US gave August manufacturing would gotten production lines going faster fudging December considering literally manufacturing vaccines platform years, it‚Äôs like surprised find new requirements. That's they've said. know true saying Earth flat. We'll lucky actually end year. infection fatality rate 0.05 0.7 depending source. Mumbia study puts 0.05 0.1%, German study puts 0.38%, Swiss study 0.68%, CDC around 0.7%. 250k pop? on. took wrong vaccine you? rate course never change things never scale up. truly hope it‚Äôs minority, keeping expectations low. layman, types reports create allot confusion. Pfizer reported stated vaccine effective new variants including 484. elderly mother get first dose really excited isolated past year following guidelines. kind thing really concerns me. wears mask gloves gets everything sent house right wants get hair done go shopping second dose. 

How high potentiality escape talking getting conflicting reports mention pfizer? real story here? Nah. COVID supports BLM, protest want folks. Yes thats think happen know they'll take time keeping asking donations donations donations finally slowly start handing out. read exactly same, early days definitely said symptoms stay home isolate testing slowly ramped up, suspect figures (fudged) testing readily available.

That's course saying tonnes people covid tested headline says tested positive. short term, us lowest priority benefit people vaccinated reduce strain hospitals. Right bad time get injured need emergency care anything, covid19. danger injury identical injury year ago.

As hospital strain goes down, chances surviving medical emergency go up. Normies getting may/June? Fuck, way US going, it'll 10 fucking years get enough people vaccinated. really hope something changes, quickly. Give me. want it. Goddamn it, give me. handful. Recovery infection confers better immunity vaccine. least that's evidence suggests. FLU! grrrr    Japan. None even *approved* yet. :/ We're currently looking February approval, March/April priority rollout, normies getting vax May/June earliest (though, typical bureaucracy here, I'm actually expecting able get Aug/Sept. then.) government literally care live die.

These questions answered phase 3 trials. trials completed Covaxin. 

This driven combination desperation nationalism Indian government. Life isn‚Äôt fair Selfish people understand spirits. agree dumbfucks around political spectrum shit good things form narrative reasonable ask phase 3 trials data? What's wrong questioning reason hastened approval covaxin phase 3 trials yet ? ""made India"" tag? Moderna pfizer vaccines approved West phase 3 results. Sputnik released phase 3 trials world doubted efficacy due hastened approval sounding shady political reasons name making obvious statement geo political supremacy. 

Most Indians pro vaccine questioning scientific method vaccine approval interfered, anti-vaxx, legit concern maintain scientific methods away political pressures. negative effects due seemingly shady hastened approval ""made india"" vaccine, like Russians did, affect public trust vaccines future. 

You point extremist narrative making religious/political issue real nature majority questions purely rational scientific sense grounded reality, sensationalism. Good luck polarizing every rational question in. Partly, lot Oxford vaccine, made UK get first access quicker shorter supply chain. AIDS thing worried sure. Canada cheap meds long US subsidizes E484K prevalent Brazil reinfection happens Brazil chance E484K based prevalence.

It basic truth variant virus people infected first whatever variant around first infected, variant virus people infected second whatever variant around infected second.

That may sound stupid point out, know reinfections happen we're going see happen whatever variants kicking around.

Unless there's dramatically larger amount E484K reinfections background rate infections E484K literally nothing concerned about. One case really newsworthy, except variant-fever generating clickbait headlines. Yes, read article want time back. dislike basically gave click encourages make even awful articles like this. unethical. understand writers newspapers also scientific education. malice. still frustrating. far I'm aware Canadian authorities people done much better job managing virus England United States. latter two countries high list completely incapable controlling virus desperately need saving vaccine. numbers cases loss life beyond belief. United States authorities really need get vaccine act together point. Yep. I‚Äôm surprised people don‚Äôt go Covid 19 sub factual true. You‚Äôd think people want read Covid they‚Äôd wanna read truth. Instead come sub get fed BS fall mass media manipulation. People believe literally anything. News outlets find way scare us get clicks since got glint hope vaccines.

But seriousness, worst thing variants increased infectiousness.  Clickbait crap article post. 'kids' article thirty year old type one diabetes one healthy person got vaccinated otherwise going waste. Thanks good employer. might saved someone's life. grandmother died today COVID. mother‚Äôs side family infected Christmas. refused attend party told family bad idea. sick I‚Äôll never see grandma again. hate family. idea anymore. I‚Äôm coming 10 months interesting read cheers sharing. Please stop believing everything news media reporting. biggest threat humanity today. seeing this? Bloomberg says 13.7 million doses total administered, 13.7 receiving least one dose. mean span decades even centuries. Eventually we'll get flu strain bad Spanish flu again, I'm assuming. Current UK vaccination speed would everyone vaccinated ~200 days, July. huge stretch believe. Influenza Coronavirus thus work same. pinche big time outbreak worsens

we havent even seen African variant virus yet....

FML feel like neglecting second dose. Still waiting vaccine shot here... I'm excited chikungunya mRNA vaccine.

Fucking Mexican mosquitoes. Don‚Äôt forget army! idea. always agree articles, always worth reading. Vaccines lead less hospital admissions, deaths. literally studies vaccines. 

Over summer lifted lot restrictions weight hospitals lifted. Theres literally direct correlation said press conferences lifting restirctions. Google UK Covid rate look graph. Look flat, you‚Äôll notice thats people started going summer. 

Do really think government doesn‚Äôt want lemmings getting back work, paying taxes, paying wages? 

Honestly scares could one there. take hold there, spreads much faster. Things gradually headed towards normality uk, bam, super lock needed. Hospitals fucked, something like 1 10 people london it. got (for 2nd time), idea how, I'm really careful. Never going happen. Lockdown 3 going well summer comes around, people aren‚Äôt going give shit rules anymore. Hopefully, vulnerable vaccinated wondering whether would used get bodies make lactase we're lactose intolerant.

Imagine year jab triggered body make missing proteins various illnesses. world live in. US get many doses many countries market vaccine? R value number extrapolate empirical studies. It‚Äôs affected many things, virus NYC vs Alaska may different reproductive rates density etc. like refer ass physician

You kidding said that. 17% Canadian population 65+. currently 1.2% population first dose. government predicts Stage 1 vaccination period, focuses elderly, end May. probably around summer It‚Äôs likely first dose doesn‚Äôt stop virus, help people survive effects virus. decided better people get slight resistance less people get total resistance. way, less people die NHS it, private contractor Much better clinical trials supporting. wonder drug though.  ""More people vaccinated tested positive"" shitty comparison. Downvote idc still shite comparison categories 80-90+ years old frail? kids affected this? vaccine guarantee carry virus.

Because vaccine 100% effective.

Because clear indication restrictions removed virus hospitalisation rate decreases. positive step, like anything past year can't get complacent virus thrown multiple challenges every turn. Long way go everyone. Unfortunately, like many first-world countries, Japan thinks better everyone else. one bureaucracy would ever take *outsider's* word. Pressure rest world makes Japan double- triple-down stubbornness. Indians fucking good vaccinations. See numbers stack soon. I'm asymptomatic, signs know I'm infected? I've googled apparently still retain taste smell despite asymptomatic. anything besides besides getting test know?

Think went like 40 days without case Dec 10 row atm would need plan vaccine?

In July/August allowed go bars, restaurants family BBQs. Thats days registering 0 covid deaths. 

Once certain percentage vaccinated, get 0 deaths often, eventually none consistently. really isn‚Äôt difficult. point positive results normal expected, therefore legitimate criticism vaccine. expect cases drop? war truth. Q winning. Lmao 'If want something ban it, cause I'm fucking dog person'

Not states allow grocery stores alcohol. still uncertainty South African strain additional mutations compared UK one.  Hi. There's bit 'lively debate amongst fellow doctors NHS work receiving second vaccine immunologist sent info out, bit long read useful think

Got top info immunologist everyone kicking secondly vaccine delay consultant chat:

ar all
¬†
The British Society Immunology statement covid vaccine dosing- accessed here- British Society Immunology statement COVID-19 vaccine dosing schedules | British Society Immunology
Bottom line: Expert opinion. immunologists would agree delaying second ‚Äòbooster‚Äô dose protein antigen vaccine (such two approved COVID-19 vaccines) eight weeks would unlikely negative effect overall immune response post-boost.
¬†
And look graph (see below/attached) New England Journal study published shows incidence COVID19 study population time. blue patients received placebo red received vaccine. day 3 near identical results groups. expected- vaccine effect several days later immune system time develop response it.
¬†
As immune response builds group received vaccine - incidence (number) new cases COVID becomes low group (red line starts flatten). lines slowly separate other. day 10 completely different paths - showing vaccinated patients much lower rate infection.
There information circulating first vaccine gives 52% protection. 52% figure average protection 21 days, includes initial time immune system time create response vaccine.
¬†
If instead one looks day 10 day 21 period -by time immune response developed booster given- vaccine appears 86% effective. one looks day 0 day 10 period 10% effective. 52% figure mix two completely different scenarios.
¬†
If don‚Äôt develop COVID within10 days getting vaccine, level protection 86%. High levels protection therefore develop booster would expected good level protection maintained week 10-12. decision spread time booster based type analysis.
¬†
¬†
Ôøº
¬†
Taken together analysis data NEJM paper statement BSI think sufficient evidence decision.
Personally agree others also commented would prefer single dose gap ensure friends, colleagues family also get first dose also protection.  second jab week ago Hawaii. work healthcare. Still, state ranked among worst states number vaccines storage, waiting ""right"" recipients.

I might one people utterly impressed (in US) given 10 million doses 95% effective vaccine, using brand new technology, virus never knew existed year ago. incredible feat humanity ages. types comments dangerous. keep telling people late they're going stop caring get worse.

Mods delete now. Yea, lets take GenZedong user's word China blame instead ... whole reason closed economy many old people getting sick dying hospitals collapse.

If vaccinate everyone 60, deaths drop 95% barely know pandemic going on. We'd return normal soon after.

If everyone 60 first, deaths decline much, all. pandemic last well year, maybe even next year, wait 60s get vaccinated risk hospitals collapsing  Seems pretty effective Pfizer vaccine estimated confer 91% protection one dose 95% two constraints many doses quickly administered seems sensible give first doses many people possible. Actually US high infant mortality compared developed nations: looks exponential. That's kind exponential growth get behind. I‚Äôm sure meant add follow question ‚Äòand many would died/had serious reactions COVID vaccinated‚Äô... live infection maps like John Hopkins online pandemic started public access see spread variant ? realize spread scarcely reported far wondering tool available. (Replying separately): Yes, exponential growth definitely speed process. forgot comment that. get R value lowered. 

How possible? thought virus absolute R value regardless much little spreading time? Lmao grocery stores carry alcohol! casinos? Outdoors mask bad. Although cold air problem. Americans shit health would actually increase. two vaccines - one essentially AZ/Oxford vaccine made india Serum homegrown Covaxxin. controversy latter former one primarily exported (afaik, would exported course) require vaccination travel, takes us discrimination.‚Äù

Don't several countries already require yellow fever vax travel there? It‚Äôs like since May/June long haulers people never hospitalized. Remember 10-20% long haulers according studies UK data NL. Well... PPE debacle nurses wearing garbage bags. ‚Äúwe‚Äòll make test, oops messed can‚Äôt test‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wear masks mandate don‚Äôt work‚Äù followed soon ‚Äúthe wear masks mandate you‚Äôll kill granny,‚Äù followed atrocious half-hearted lockdowns, followed horrendous vaccine rollout many states...

The stimulus checks. shit show getting unemployment. Huge corporations receiving handouts. Tanking economy small businesses.

Yeah... dropped ball pretty much every aspect pandemic. maybe pessimistic would think governments want vaccinate terminal people least won‚Äôt added Covid death numbers go. optics. country decent size, besides Israel U.K., better distributing vaccine U.S. Sounds like something pillow guy would support. physician trained trust good randomized placebo controlled trials... even agree expertise... science large it‚Äôs process every year flu, scaled up. lot harder farm inept companies connected Tory party like track trace PPE. I‚Äôm saying nature running it‚Äôs course good. I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs basically what‚Äôs happening. I'm frontline vaccine last week. wonder going well, incredibly well-organised. speak centre amazed smooth whole system worked husband (who's also frontline also got jab) joked airport security run like this, everyone would seats 10 minutes. BAME used shorthand black people, UK lump minorities group called ""black people"". sure getting information results cringe induced, correct. warnings federal provincial governments, Coutu husband, Montreal, decided take trip anyway, knowing would quarantine two weeks upon return.   wasn‚Äôt big deal booked,‚Äù said Moira Coutu, booked family‚Äôs annual holiday vacation late November.   let people travel. don‚Äôt want people travel, don‚Äôt let travel beginning,‚Äù said.  hearing people dying Norway due Pfizer vaccine, I'm second thoughts getting it. unwarranted? take account long-term anti-social depression effects society lockdown long. 

The article mentions life expectancy dropped 0.1 years 2015/16/17 - imagine much worse 2020.

It‚Äôs entirely possible mental consequences isolation lockdown larger impact life expectancy COVID directly did. important thing getting jab drastically reduce likelihood developing severe Covid-19 requiring hospitalization. Thus healthcare system become overwhelmed like parts US now.

And although article says known vaccines stop spread, infected people symptoms still spread completely asymptomatic person.

e.g: might still able spread vaccinated, somebody who's infected coughing wheezing going spread lot more, etc. Almost half way matching number positive tests future, is! happens alcoholics start detox? They're going go you‚Äôre going find issue whatever say whatever.

I'm trying illustrate y'all keep talking everything needs shut month understand exactly many jobs essential. studies run 2 years going track immunity know sure estimate Several different types chromatography filtration, basically. Liquid liquid extraction used cases biological molecules don‚Äôt really like leave aqueous phase. anything else going destroy large molecule separate it. Well inevitable, many already infected immune. I‚Äôm pretty sure fat people already know they‚Äôre cutting decades life expectancy heart disease risk factors. ugly heart attacks wasn‚Äôt already motivation enough, covid change anything? brush issues rug nobody gives fuck. Honestly... i'd take answer *when think* we'll answer question point Yeah tough call really. 
Do tell everyone truth reinforce it. Make sure people know risks they're actually taking.
Which said, would result lot anti Vaxers getting confused old ghosts comming back haunt us. 
Or keep quiet ultimately damage causes would less harmful resultant mess newly empowered anti Vaxers.

My head hurts Man. Think grey smoke dribble ear :(   100% agree, last years blunders expecting fail, gotta give government credit credits due they‚Äôve done great job vaccine rollout far (thanks NHS too) R/syac strict one 8th Feb (instead 24th January)  Yeah, *actual lie.*

You vaccinated doses, they're peddling misinformation everyone received dose one ""vaccinated"" already.

Counting chickens eggs successfully hatched. be. Production keep demand second round.
It‚Äôs much important get people first jab ASAP.  think hospice care people one lasts goes health care people w underlying conditions college/school aged kids, hospice, general public. dont want sound heartless something, me, hospice thing doesnt make sense bc they'll likely die quite soon entry. would make sense vaccinate ACTUAL tax payers since know economy months extremely focused topic. Idk man. Ik ive dealin w shit im drained emotionally. opinion rollouts been. probably testing old people first purpose, ya never know anymore.. I‚Äôm guessing travel bans countries catch up. example UK vaccinates like 80% successful case rates deaths low there‚Äôs way people continue sit lockdown say France haven‚Äôt able keep up. People general enough, even lockdown almost year solid followed rules like breaking point. Thats always known? lot people devastated pandemic health financial reasons, lost time, lose 2 breakout years whatever phase life right now? flu /s That‚Äôs theres nowhere go. They‚Äôre already other‚Äôs houses. refering saying ‚Äúvaccinated UK tested...‚Äù

The ‚Äúthan tested‚Äù sounds completely wrong. Idk. Im english major.  Yes. Every adult wants shoukd vaccinated June/July. thanks France. France forced EU turn 500m extra vaccines Pfizer EU favour vaccines Sanofi, French pharmaceutical company, ready September/October 2021.

The EU great, individual countries much power defeats purpose bloc. Seems money matters saving  Awesome  UE?

Do mean EU? New Orleans super spreader events every night now.

[This tonight French Ah know, I‚Äôm sure. They‚Äôve tried years lose weight abstract concept healthier, guess covid really scary boogieman felt like acute threat. also laid pretty thick saying wanted sure would live see grandchild again. didn‚Äôt think would change anything, started dieting kept going solid 7 months so. really hope keep long term. RU ok? 1.13 years due COVID-19. Perhaps comparison another country COVID-19 control 325k vaccines day 24/7 vaccine ‚Äúhubs‚Äù getting rolled major cities. rate continues that‚Äôs 2.275m per week. would take 30 weeks entire UK population. adults June feasible. scotland, 1 million received vaccinations week Covishield did. Covaxin still Phase 3 trials still administered  likely anxiety. experienced near identical symptoms them, managed control fears distress symptoms progressively faded. CXRs blood tests lie, signs abnormalities likely healthy. symptomatic friends recovered Covid also said there‚Äôs distinct feeling along symptoms. exactly bought Moderna stocks. 

The potential mRNA tech nearly infinite. Imagine able force cells make kind antigen prevent illness training immune system? 

Absolutely gamechanging. yes. dont know. looking stastic swedish gouvernment. find one post here. talk Shhhh reddit, plug hivemind speak absolutes.

We entering dangerous territory media social media brushing rug, average folks street clue half vaccinating kids normal stuff can't grasp difference end measles place. fantastic. world wide IQ also rise 4k americans dying daily mistake then. think initial batch produced Italy used trials. one miscalculated ended discovering half dose first jab, full second best outcome. happy get vaccine, want clear plan lockdowns restrictions it.

Weird logic. ‚ÄúWe gone far see out!‚Äù

At point really feels like going fall sunk cost fallacy. Maybe USA country slow vaccine waiting eradication, point cost restrictions going catch up

There‚Äôs gotta tipping point realize continuing something sake ending sooner, doesn‚Äôt make sense ‚Äúend‚Äù continuously gets pushed back. Hotel: Trivago Ah maybe missed honest people pretty good. Roads empty 9am.  100 US die car crash every day. much rise cases attributed new variant? much attributed Christmas. Portugal's cases skyrocketing since December 27th. chance portugese little cozy holidays? 
I want downplay new variants, come time another big factor play, namely holiday season. thing UK; sharp increase, decreasing. he? I‚Äôm that‚Äôs enough sweetie back upstairs room First dose, vaccinate.... accept huge annoyance you.

But also accept others occasionally getting illness part life. Yes first groups 50. wondering done they‚Äôll divide rest even more, like essential workers including retail teachers etc, everyone else Good got community spread control! definitely here. word 'vaccinations' used incorrect way. mean 'doses'. obvious enough joking?  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd assume point towards end 2021. stick timeline think said expect final group (young people) receive first dose end August would mean they‚Äôre probably done second doses like November. fatality rate. Even prevent getting mild flu getting vaccinated already worth me. huge annoyance inconvenience. Believe whatever want. positivity rate, number people tested stands itself. We've quite clearly limited numbers. There's also little reporting it, compared countries. We've seen kinds techniques SARS: Japan insisted *no cases* safe come here, patently obvious could true, guess what? Surprise, lied, everywhere. ZOE predicts symptomatic cases it‚Äôs likely bit higher they‚Äôre reporting using type vaccine

Yes Sooo...moderna. dropping already.  Headline makes sound like they‚Äôre unemployed Boston. way nuked almost comments asking science believers proof. ""incivility"". course said anything even remotely rude.

This place policed hard. wonder long work, sure people waking surely somebody starting smell something weird going on. Lol mate. Good try though.

Furthermore, people absolutely disgusting would care part time worker's life again, actually think retail/food jobs clergy. mean else gonna pay taxes?

I live another Asian country controlled it, believe controlled too. know people Japan grant you, *one* voiced similar sentiments also know plenty people bonkers think controlled either numbers made (even think whole virus harmless), conspiracy cranks tend discount.

I totally buy Japan third wave public health emergency, sure is. government already declared state emergency. relative Western countries? believe Japan actually bad US Europe covering whole thing up. obscene lie, allmost vile malicious lies potentially reaching herd immunity naturally

&amp;#x200B;

Where get noton antibodies last YEARS? reinfections common enough, 8 moths seems outside imunity this. flu , saying smugh insolent \*\*\*? it?

&amp;#x200B;

I see bellow implying masks dont work. death cultists, smug too. Put fuckin mask keep fuckin mouth shut Everytime i‚Äôve seen someone say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing worry about‚Äù subreddit they‚Äôve always proven wrong. Look fat whities American middle states. official sources based positive tests, models. fact similar point. others said, they're using existing infrastructure letting people know this, jobs. Rather outsourcing companies idea they're (a la PPE, Dido Harding's track trace, testing centres outsourced Deloitte frankly disasters). California bad Hispanics? That's going with? That's PC, Himler. simultaneously true 

1) letting virus spread intentionally reach herd immunity poor idea 

2) lot virus spreading get herd immunity quickly 

Those aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive statements vaccines big ‚Äúif‚Äù resistant variants take over. No, way around.
You're selfish caring public health moaning can't go favourite restaurant...
Meanwhile people suffering, passing away, loved ones hurting can't say goodbye without risking infecting others. severe side effects deaths ive seen reported Indian news media idk trust worthy time. Lying isn‚Äôt cool, man. comment history says you‚Äôve lived US 35 years. seen high quality peer reviewed studies supporting ivermectin.  one, please cite journal. think read study carefully. authors claiming natural infection *only* 85% effective.

I think go stuff, wear mask, protection point others. mask effective stopping active covid leaving face spreading others. particularly important time lot people fully vaccinated new super covid strain dominant variety. J&amp;J vaccine American Belgian too.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  one them, one unsung heroes! People rural India still 5-6 children. provided cheap contraception. support government. read study researchers found 2 ""probable"" reinfections 6600 confirmed COVID cases, another 42 ""possible"" reinfections.

The 85% figure baseline. Natural immunity *at least* 85% effective. 85% effective millions people would already reinfected, there's hope hell number reinfections could gone unnoticed.

I mean, fair, study find even single *confirmed* case reinfection 6600 front line health care workers literally highest risk group exposure. tell you? similar conversations literally everyone know virus, even late December (or anyone know) encountered someone real life even *knew* somebody died it. encourage certain way thinking virus make look certain way everyone know like ""I even know someone affected, you?"" tbh reflection think I'd happy expected lay die people know go back normal. probably good they're protecting vulnerable, never know, might turn we're old. Happy British friends family.  17 years old 4 issues COVID :

1 - lockdown

2 - face masks

3 - school shutdowns

4 - able see friends

All 4 damaging mental health. entire world going pissed find virus killing immune systems leading immune deficiency time........... That‚Äôs terrible argument. average age Covid19 deaths greater life expectancy. 

If think economic social chaos resulting lockdown worth save people, good you. you‚Äôre ridiculously selfish enforce rest us. rate vaccine needed. looking numbers, US 10x deaths per million, compared India. 

Also, government capped number people vaccinated centre 100 day now. former US Army combat medic, current Covid survivor/long hauler, I‚Äôm going tell right ‚Äì fire doctor find another one. don‚Äôt listen you, they‚Äôre bad doctor. There‚Äôs plenty evidence everything you‚Äôre describing Covid. Fuck guy. Could imagine variant could‚Äôve come Australia didn‚Äôt contain it. Like everything kill lives there.  Yeah, could still vaccinated people get infected spread it. Even 60 percent less likely spread great full maskless crowd, even contagious 2-3 days. Germany all, thanks fucking feudalism. sovereigns (prime ministers) revoked order. children go back school tomorrow. 1995 here, relate 90s stuff well cause going 2000s, damn poor new technology reach till 2008. Grew 30 channels, VHS freaking old computer finally died 2009. sick July, got antibody test today still them. Everyone‚Äôs different. Intubates Brazilian Vaccines damn incredible work. bad lot people fucking morons. Shhh now, adults talking still entering work force 2000 Zoe app isn‚Äôt official figures Thanks dude leave school teachers people interact with? Additionally imagine Chinese ordered like 1 billion Sinovac Indians similar number Astra-zenica/Oxford  1 10 tested kid France covid, we're closing schools education primordial.

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

Also many parents can't stand idea kids home day, frankly depressing. 

I shocked colleague told day ""as long close schools! stand daughters home day, fight time.""

And make reconsider parenting? lot comes perception you‚Äôd consider good. people might think drive 15 mins symptoms first get test shitty.

And beginning rural areas told they‚Äôd drive hour get test beginning. Obviously stories news lead perception wasn‚Äôt great. grumble times. found article Greater Los Angeles Area (5 counties).   
Even bigger.  
18.7 million people. shouldnt make claims cant back up. Fauci saying vaccine widely available April. NY State saying take 12 months get everyone vaccinated. widely different time lines. think real danger promising something. Last thing want people loosing faith That's true, government absolutely feckless pandemic, but, testing second none here, I've tested weekly work since July last year, since beginning year I've tested 3 times week. UK sure. We're already fat vitamin deprived, handled like shit Something big changes what, 5 days?  extremely scary thankfully science save us. Especially country damn famed science! Say whatever want guys there, always saw America place science growing experts saying vaccines work new strains. worry new strains wreaking havoc get herd immunity going vaccines. Could cause lot death short amount time blowing case numbers. Obviously scientific team behind study get memo lizard people delay research.  Medicine finds new treatments using good placebo controlled randomized trials. Dude like whole world shut went chaos virus still believe revolves around Donald Trump? it? can‚Äôt deal people anymore vaccine effective reducing severity disease, catch it. reducing likelihood you‚Äôll catch it. 

From understanding. Preach. can't Australia use UK MHRA approval? similar board, quicker think.  Keep head man, accepting things slid always first step back track, wild many people give instead confronting get covid what's point vaccination? already contracted disease probably 1Bn infections worldwide far genetically cofirmed reinfections. math yourself. 

If infection confer robust immunity, would awash stories reinfections numbering tens thousands least. 

What's more, COVID vaccine conferred better immunity natural infection, would first vaccines respiratory viruses.

There reason world think vaccines confirm superior immunity natural infection unless preponderance evidence support notion, certainly present. hate lot people talk lockdowns affect young adults, teenagers, children. I‚Äôm tired people acting like seniors at-risk people victims events past year, must everything possible protect elderly mental trauma opportunities stripped away experienced young people collateral damage, it‚Äôs acceptable response say ‚Äúbetter killing grandma‚Äù bring school shutdowns negatively affect childhood development. 

I won‚Äôt forgive blatant disregard others, lack empathy acting morally superior. miss Colombia üá®üá¥ (American healthcare worker Los Angeles here). hospital disorganized vaccinated even given vaccination card. shitshow. believe median symptoms onset 5 6 days, many weeks. Although, obviously cases 14 even days (rarely). side effects? Okay guess that's confused hahahaha like they're paying them.. 1,000 shots day large population?

We ramped production soon promising trials. mean building new factories scratch level ramping up.

No reason million doses day moment go ahead. health effects obesity due fat arbitrary number No. accurate Agreed . üëç know believe it? evidence telling shouldn't, nearly every scientist field telling so. Getting many people companies authorities lie would harder making actual vaccine, holy shit. seriously believe every single country world conspiring us, may need psychologist. maybe single thing saves Johnson conservatives Learn question is, sonny boy.  It‚Äôs trap!!!! No, I'm arguing assigning worth relative unless extremis, ultimately pointless. Young people hard done pandemic, much ask them. 2 Million global deaths far, number. 2 million person, family earned right protection. There's antibiotic resistant gonorrhea careful Japan complicated history vaccinations though, one highest rates vaccine hesitancy. Probably highest developed world. One reason complications MMR vaccine 90s subsequent court ruling made government responsible adverse effects vaccines, turn made government scrap mandatory vaccinations, turn feeds idea public consciousness vaccines safe. government really can't afford give impression approval process anything 100% meticulous give people reason suspicious particular vaccine. Whether end going far direction different matter though. Sorry loss:( Thats always top deliberately wasting time bc im heartless towards them. blunt, im little desensitized past year personal life shit. come cruel shit dont mean to, havent felt lot emotion while. Nonetheless, Yes unfortunately america deal w idiots deny covid despite other's loved ones dying refusal wear mask building. Stupidity everything im sure americans hated something. said, believe sooner vaccines roll out, quicker get people least semi-protected get herd immunity eventually. I'll getting first dose tomorrow I've already talked different people know say getting vaccine they're worried safe. going battle trying convince people get done. form restriction place less year. choice death minor inconvenience, therefore, choice all. Peoples opinions first. positivity rate matters. need test much less virus start. Japan maintained low positivity rate third wave recently 5% target recently still ballpark UK lower US, indicates catching many cases.

I doubt missing cases. positivity rate suggests likely missing cases rate UK, less US.

That makes scale numbers comparable indicates scale epidemic Japan fact substantially lower Western countries.

None dependent idea catching every case. West either know. best indicator true numbers amount excess deaths compared previous years. Japan regard? recovered extreme circumstances combination leukemia, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant. 

What meant vaccines trigger body's immune response usually fights infection, making sure future pathogen can't take hold body already knows it. human ever immune response successfully fights HIV, there's nothing vaccine trigger. similar reason malaria vaccine unreliable, vaccine work well body innate ability fight infection. medical consensus benfits far outweigh risks, thats every country covid problems using vaccines way out, see country different approach? wonder would change? fast produce sequence new strains virus get mRNA production rapidly. store transport major pain butt adds cost dose.

So easier produce terms able get production ASAP, necessarily produce overall cheaper manner vaccines get relatively delicate require lot care store transport. Ireland 2 week :) Thanks corruption still don‚Äôt single vaccine country astounding well going.

Tories smell money. That's matters them. vaccinations = reopened economy. allowed let millions die achieve herd immunity leaving economy fully open would happily done that. frightening people level stupid teaching Every country fk3dup people . Look USA 50% population cov!d denying trruump supporters . lot countries scam callers india . scammers scamming ind!ans . get reported victims also pandemic. making bad image whole country 1.3 B population becoz 1% scaming criminals fk3d .

Unlikely I‚Äôll caught it‚Äôs asking trouble, especially got test Monday, worked Tuesday, test came back positive Wednesday. see mean? yet morrisons still can't follow government guidelines cut daily deaths half, more. talk reopening schools? saying work, know plenty doctors board mass vaccination healthy people. Risk/Benefits ratio...  Depends goal, 25 daily infections last 7 days per 100k even zero covid. could take much longer 10 weeks. politicans demand complete reopening, Heiko Maas demands lift restrictions vaccinated people. keep commenting everywhere bring valid points, however medical consensus regarding ceratin vaccines (like now) surely work.

That's scenario virus get control. imagine hard track people contacted 102 people, contacted super spreader got tested positive. that, guy apparently come different region( Heilongjiang), traveled different train bus reach health center gave lectures elderly. Good luck finding people go trains buses him. folks keep blabbering: 


""Dear China


You keep saying cases country yet build emergency hospitals



Curious ""



They build emergency hospitals exactly reason: suddenly surge number positive case like ( 100 cases time) need place isolate immediately. faster get charged hospitals, better chance serious patients (if have) survive. country there's sentence: ""You build cage cows already lost"". Always expected prepared worst case scenario possible otherwise terrible situation shit hit fan  media don‚Äôt talk Portugal? 10k daily cases days, South America spike much worse before. results. people ignore them, course looks like none. month ago 50.000 active infections per day.

Also, seriously? people 10 months yet understand number infections would way higher, done nothing? incredibly hard understand? Look Sweden, almost lockdown one highest number active infections per 100.000 people planet last ten months. people understand correlation lockdown high infection numbers? serious question.

If go outside one jacket cold, think: ""Well, jacket nothing, better take off.""? No, realize correlation wearing jackets less cold put thicker jacket. not?  Well
The alternative lockdown free spreading completely unhindered covid. That‚Äôs gotta great business, right? supermarkets stock much it, takes huge amount space price sell at.

So shortages way pronounced tinned goods example easy store bulk. Yes first one.. we‚Äôve delayed second one 12 weeks manufacturers guidelines Raab even said morning can‚Äôt guarantee everyone get second one. I‚Äôd feel lot comfortable people getting second jab per guidelines. far know, NHS workers eligible since day one. mom (68) best friend (33) work NHS first jabs. Neither front line workers. Netherlands almost transmissions happens home, either household guests over. case restaurants, bars hairdressers open too. Sure lockdowns helps slow spread, sure help stop completely. Hah, thank you! side? 

Like, living ultra cheaply potatoes cabbage now? Could high risk people Mexicans say : tomate un seven, echate vicks en el pecho, con eso se quita. There‚Äôs early indications Israeli data need 2 doses though Ah yes, follow science, ask questions. lol ok then.

""As January 8, 2021, total around 5.3 million people Japan underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests coronavirus (COVID-19), 4.9 million tests patients within country. day, total approximately 265.3 thousand cases confirmed positive virus."" 4.9 million even country.

Our population well 126 million. even close acceptable rate testing? we're testing, idea prevalent is, that's whole point. People (rightfully) shit Trump head-in-the-sand ""if test coronavirus cases"" approach, Japan thing people fall excuse it.  Wishing best dude! Also heard get vaccinated infected, true? ( read net, can't sure, sorry)   uncle 70s got jab yesterday. GP comes Worcestershire. Overall we'd better off, much 1,600,000,000 / 191,000 = 8,376 days.  / 365.25 = 22.93 years

I mean... going hyperbolic, least hyperbolic ;p I'm sure statistics, definitely line draw one would rather take mRNA vaccine, sure is, let's say 70+ 55+ serious ill like cancer diabetic obese. Now, honest vaccines mRNA emergency use, I'd say line much lower. Perhaps anyone 50+ adult pre-existing condition. point need transparency people weight options recommendations based what's happening. would say sensible assume spread know sure either way. know, cautious opposed finding hard way. 18‚Äôs wish be*  Least safe felt whole pandemic dentist. hour without mask on, another patient 10 feet away. retrospect would gone. feel like military forgotten bit whole situation - biggest UK military operation peacetime theyve working round clock supporting NHS every stage fight Covid - mention losing Christmases getting European hauliers tested dover back europe think relatives people dying writing mail tabloid?

They definitely would, happens everything else. 

If public dying story gets Chinese disinformation agents page pretending China concealing evidence. Chinese government backs garbage theories deflect blame Chinese government tried stir confusion virus‚Äôs origin. promoted theories, little evidence, outbreak might started imports tainted seafood, notion rejected international scientists agencies.

Scientists inspectors turned away researching origins virus. Why?

When Trump cut funding PREDICT, blamed stupidity. save $200 million cutting agency isolates major infectious disease every 4 months? Super dumb funding PREDICT cut, America would observers Chinese lab. months later, outbreak. Could change handling/operation lab? anyone Trump family receive bribe cut funding? China want weaponize lab want Americans out?

With number worldwide deaths true origins investigated. Mistrust authority, insular communities higher religious beliefs probably account part it. Wrong. tested N501Y only, E484K. think do, one service user costs tax payer tune 6k week. one man.you understand said making opinions yourself,I think nhs poorly ran, government overpaid consultants. could lot efficient. outsourcing ridiculous, using agencies gaps staff, one reason. Killing vaccine pleasant either Sure, reduce number times part life (and severity) we? go back /r/conspiracy seem like sub Strange.. checked link posted works.. error see? I'll try fix it. Hey! 200 minutes facebook youtube makes qualified medical professional 200 months study! /s say Germany Eastern Europe? lost? sub science, conspiracies. gullible enough believe anything hear without evidence? Go back /r/conspiracy Depends mean ""well"". I'm glad making progress vaccine developers stated, trials include long break 2 doses. decision delay second dose people first dose sooner ends ineffective actually requiring another set doses or, worst case scenario, ends vaccine ineffective would definitely say going ""well"".

I'd rather 5% done 10% half done unknown consequences. You‚Äôre confusing flu cold - flu always difficult disease even healthy people. doesn‚Äôt cause death often doesn‚Äôt make ‚Äúunpleasant‚Äù! comes zero knownledge sheltered dum dum coming bottom dwelling natural habitat talking baseless stup!d sh!t . 'Murica fiiiiiiiine. Shout LA 1 million cases.......  time, way Florida handled covid viewed positively. know much costs house someone social care that's mean. really understand opinion, saying would better NHS completely privatised? whole point socialising profit taken private companies, keeps costs high, would go away cost would reduced regulated. Problems bureaucracy management structure different hurdles exist private social care structures solved. Daily infections starting fall UK (but that‚Äôs lockdown, vaccines) - vaccines impact transmission looking good Israeli data Shit post usual UK smashing üôè me, went away 1-2 weeks Think number fatalities without vaccines. Like not, benefits greatly outweighs cons. believe main bottleneck supply rather people/locations administering vaccinations. Hopefully change weekly counts constrained. think J&amp;J's third trial ends soon hopefully approved give us third source vaccines. Direct link full really? Crying loud.  India China relations lowest since 1962 1967 (our last war) India actively publicly trying reduce imports. context comment sounded like taunt Dont know. Nobody bothered study. hey guess common sense arent creditable here.  hoping quick pause back normal.

In fact, quick pause back substantially higher production rates. - compounding effect production rates (and corresponding impact virus transmission) coming months easily outweigh small initial delay now. case, longer term view take precedence. way urge hesitant people get vaccinated, get it, it‚Äôs also fair many people want get vaccinated may still wait months turns. point positivity rates comparable indicates case numbers missed also comparable, converse, case numbers comparable.

And look case numbers, 20 times lower Japan.

Again- I'm saying ""no problem"" Japan. problem hell lot lower Japan UK (or US). UK rushing 90,000 deaths (at half population). US rushing 400,000. Japan 4,000 nowhere near that. mean 4,000 problem, nowhere near problem Western countries. Mine‚Äôs exceptionally weird. taste fine, completely lost sense smell, makes sense. universal smell get smelling really specific things. It‚Äôs predominant smell coffee, avocados, eggs, sweat, tomatoes, it‚Äôs exactly every one these. I‚Äôm 22 case extremely mild, idk.  schools closed months now... isn‚Äôt, really. EU specifically European Union. it‚Äôs used abbreviation Europe, that‚Äôs mistake. hell HIV vaccine actually going work virus already resistant antibodies begin with? party pooper doesn‚Äôt make sense. Unless they‚Äôre going genetically modify bone marrow making ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù produce CD4+ cells lack receptor HIV virus attaches to, that‚Äôs going happen. Granted wonder done... create genetically modified virus adds RNA/DNA cancels production cells receptor, also would possible side effects that? 

I digress, though. HIV vaccination/treatment whole next level medical treatment, it‚Äôs best focus bone marrow, cells born, take look it. russian bot impact across platforms social media  Yeah, that's good, massive unethical medical trial taking place without patient consent? know one ignore vaccine protocol delay second jab?? blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Yeah, especially since young significantly less likely suffer virus. similar talk UK (that doctors told throw away doses due guidelines areas) path towards peace equality. praying HIV vaccine success.   Concerns come Manaos, though really high % population already passed Covid.

Since studies found reinfections happen massively ""original"" Covid strains, studying explanations:

-Maybe way less people estimated already passed Covid area,
-Maybe variant trully bipass previous inmunity. illogical. vaccinate people true. would basically reached herd immunity already, place Earth reached. stop bullshitting. That's happening UK unavoidable due storage requirements Pfizer vaccine. Staff administering vaccine desperately calling friends family vaccinated avoid wasting doses. main reason people turning vaccination appointments, either difficulties making (the focus people 80) they're anti-vaxxers. Maybe government want enemy foreign nations knowing UK forces busy tied fixing undeclared herd immunity attempt. 

That want antivaxxer conspiracy nuts go even nuts military involved. mRNA vaccines potent efficacious‚Äî 90.5-95% effective vs COVID. also high rates ‚Äústimulating immune system‚Äù ‚Äî local reactions arm swelling/redness/pain, fevers, body aches, fatigue.

Note fever common dose number two. Take Tylenol Motrin day virus spread nobody traveled anywhere. globalists causing mutations traveling infecting many people possible. started c25k app June run 15 20 miles week. skinny fat much fit now. Vaccines aren‚Äôt mandatory smoking. Exactly Take shrooms Nice info vaccines won‚Äôt able get.   hate EU abbreviation europe european union  I'm sure do. see Twitter account, Tim Spector gone bit anti-lockdown lately insisting data shows true picture. I‚Äôve got three friends aged 30 work NHS they‚Äôve jab. None frontline WFH almost year.

It‚Äôs stupid really think agree it‚Äôs stupid it‚Äôs result NHS huge organisation. It‚Äôs probably quicker work list NHS employees trying work WFH not. 

It slightly grating though none people know vulnerable friends mentioned virtue NHS staff. currently known vaccine resistant variants, since we're talking small changes spike protein help cellular entry, unlikely render vaccines ineffective. Even something crazy show up, mRNA vaccines pivot month two. countries want people antibodies get vaccinated later (due better immunity) something story :) 1918 flu special case human activity selected worse strains normally less severe strains easier time spreading. People tired situation, are, want hear imagine posible bad news, sub exception.

But bad news, ""scaremonging project dejar"", actually bad news.

It shows said post: open air travel countries going take way longer many people expect, probably years. Germany one 90 year old lady pass hour vaccine state, reported yesterday unrelated. vaccine might chance spend quality time loved ones pass. whole institution vaccinated allowing visitors relatively safe, otherwise receive visitors putting risk. 

In region people legal right die alone, I'm guessing Covid really ruined that.  get point everyone's offered vaccine, would create two-tier society would create even resentment amongst young, last offered - making even harder convince unvaccinated follow rules. Really drives home much response driven lack care, lack competence ability. could easily taken charge offered stellar response, chose too.  That's true. I'm glad theres someone brains here.  Distributed states vs distributed final destination would guess. case government getting way much possible, though done fair job that, thank goodness. could likely get infected contagious like 2-3 days gets tamped quickly. 

But still 5% vaccinated people get mild covid symptoms would infectious. Even really good mRNA vaccines 100% effective preventing covid disease. Plenty places here. Miles sandy beaches, downs etc. 
 
The second lockdown don‚Äôt think anyone really stuck rules. one seems different. problem foresee strategy scaling manufacturing. 499 doses?

I think settle common robust pathways go wrong run clinical trials instead. It‚Äôs harder run studies efficacy individually tailored mRNA cure due target variables.  Giant orange soft shelled north American cockroach currently still infesting place Safety? won‚Äôt know while. big question community dangers proprietary lipid capsule well crosses blood brain barrier. May concern one vaccine, boosters? vaccines similar delivery systems? 

It‚Äôs looming question would cytotoxic intramuscular insertion systemic. 

Personally, happy enough take one dose thus far, seriously skeptical beyond that. Sorry, aware. vaccine distributed public country yet. second comment, mass deaths caused mass gatherings, large scale centralized vaccination center likely encourage. Saudi Arabia, vaccine available everyone free( Pfizer) people reason registering fear. listen fearmongers many believe Pfizer alter DNA kill them. shame! political pandemic finally HIV vaccine would game changer world  Except one says article pretty clear, misunderstood. Highly doubt you‚Äôre British fail understand fairly commonly used term media hilarious people get triggered Dude, still talking EU Europe single entities? whole comment thst EU Europe anything. EU countries high deaths (higher US), others low deaths (much lower US non western countries). purposely completly miss point?

You cannot say ""Europe western world equally failed respond covid-19"" handled poorly, suggests equally bad, VASTLY different results methods handling it. ? vaccine using? share optimism. makes sense. Thanks answering! ""reports"" - going believe low numbers? lol mean also reports / speculation millions may died (increased incinerations - i.e. deaths - lockdown time).  I'm Brazil, trust me, shit spread far wide soon enough know long term affects we? coronavirus floating randomly air (and stopping suddenly house boundaries despite houses airtight!) people seem believe. infected people careless hygiene rubbing eyes contaminated hands.

A distance 2 meters/6 feets guideline, absolute protection, avoiding close contact people greatly reduce chances getting infected. fine going outside sun. field hospitals like quarantine centers, China put positive cases medically observed quarantine effort minimize infecting family members, regular hospitals designed handle those. Wuhan too, serious cases went real hospitals, mild asymptomatic cases went field hospitals quarantine observation. Creating 2 classes citizens bad. mean fuck young people old people go vacations? Really? Feeling pride NHS Army me, amazing fuck ups qualified people left thing  watching White House lies distributing vaccines. already hundreds smaller vaccination centres hospitals surgeries. designed high-capacity easy access, large scale parking etc. 

If ‚Äúmass‚Äù deaths, mass treatment seems appropriate. Nothing perfect government fucks past year NHS decade.

The conservative mp position like week lol. 

'Not Tory' thinks talks like conservative. worry, saw friends covid ...so probably got good immune boosters free ;-)

Actually nobody knew .. PCR came back negative, antigen test came back positive months later.  sorry losses! devastating. feel üò¢ affected personally, therefore problem exist \[to them\]. 


The lack compassion empathy astounding. get chance mutate can't infect people. one step towards beating good.

I'm going choose remain optimistic here. proof virus transferable post vaccine. 1) still wear mask 2) carry proof it?? yeah go well. Believe not. thing plagued (for lack better term) entire ideas behind drug prohibition decades. That's happens someone grasps something ""scary sounding"", without looking context verifiable data. Yet still using two full doses belief ""Its natural people die"" distinct possibility prevent it. 


You're conceited thinking responses failed prove reason ""because dont wanna"" valid response protecting others getting something kill you.  refused COVID vaccine last week. 

My body choice! repeatedly said ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù Big difference.

But let‚Äôs assume means vaccinated. would two million vaccines day. That‚Äôs going happen. We‚Äôre practically end reach terms qualified individuals administering vaccine is. one, don‚Äôt see effective measure help unemployment getting restaurant workers work part time, administering vaccine. pretty standard- confirmed vaccine would covered preexisting vaccine injury schemes.

It's mandatory(ish) vaccination dictated government government takes responsibility adverse effects.


The vaccinations *not* covered act optional ones holidays messed stupid hot countries bloody humidity shit mosquito malaria whatnot.


Sorry I'm still scarred one time visited Tropics. heat breaches 35 I'm *out* Well, least places right unvaccinated people get chickenpox recover own, single recorded case history somebody recovering HIV. That's makes HIV vaccine unlikely. Yea ""getting better""  Contamination Question: 

My stepmom tested positive covid Friday. haven‚Äôt seen since last Wednesday. sister hasn‚Äôt seen since last Saturday. sister close contact week. last night (Saturday) began develop symptoms Covid-19. point safe say haven‚Äôt contracted her? I‚Äôve contact someone likely Covid positive, took test. took test 48hrs ago frankly want get life. contrary, obviously don‚Äôt want hurt anyone I‚Äôm perfectly fine quarantining appropriate amount testing need to.

Edit: Sister one who‚Äôs symptoms recently began. lie? would insurance company know smoke not? March month half away. Technically anything future weeks away want count enough weeks lol. Usually people say, ""weeks away"" mean, ""within month."" means working! They've converted part parking lot outdoor section that's go. Covid killed kideys? worthless response. fail read link supplied direct quote Pfizer? read? worse still expect everyone making comments Reddit read *every* piece information given topic? 


If anything useful contribute, keep worthless opinion yourself.  must keeping news. Pfizer Moderna said know stops one getting infected Covid. Nice  Lying numbers? Fabulous! Seriously tho wat dik I'm also SoCal, wrote decided start going again. People taking many risks feel like small one take physical mental health stay outside wear mask. gym goers definitely socializing outdoor section everyone wears masks :/ lifting program 3x week 45 minutes, like 20 minutes cardio setting everything, total I'm usually hour. need play around time go. Weekday afternoons pretty empty found Saturday mornings crowded af.  Amazing neither. wish did. Nah accounts payable NHS didn‚Äôt pick üòÖ Based data far talking ass us able identify topic headline. Try time. Yea, believe that. Sorry. routinely ask people following questions:

* What's average age people die covid positive? [80 years old, median 82]
* many people, percentage total covid deaths, 50 years old younger? [around 1%]
* news keeps repeating many people die covid positive everyday dramatic fashion possible. many people die per day (in Italy) total? [around 1800]

The typical answers would be:

* 60 years old (I get ""I absolutely idea"" many times)
* 10 30%
* Whatever daily number covid deaths + 100/200 (I get ""I absolutely idea"" many times too)

They also can't seem grasp concept die covid positive *not* 100% additional deaths absolutely happened covid thing. hear ""500 people died covid today"" news think covid killed 500 perfectly healthy people itself. verified numbers moderna? Thank best explanation seen I've thought read quite bit it.

Because 95% people die Covid least one serious health condition difference dying ""with"" ""of"" Covid important, basically almost everyone dies ""with"" it. never able understand could determined people 2, 3, 4, numerous health conditions.

Is idea well known health conditions expected managed certain number years, patient dies well time, blame Covid?

I also read normal times i.e. Covid, 300-350k people die nursing homes every year, nearly 1000 per day, population around 1.5 1.8 million. 40% Covid fatalities occurred nursing homes. question, sure actually Covid killing people? ""years life lost"" different people general population? UK government jurisdiction fine US embassy Thanks. really wish they‚Äôd stop counting since cases began. It‚Äôd helpful know many cases currently. It‚Äôs confusing reporting disingenuous died recovered. Everyone country number dose able want. saw people offering 25k rhe shot, NBA player knows, id sell mine heartbeat get later throwing money inept systems without changing who's charge going help even want THINK financially delayed I've been. supposed sit certification exam sometime next year. able accrue hours, I'm LEAST year behind career. certification would've doubled salary. I'm behind!!!!!!!! Absolutely. enough bullshit already? Telling truth would refreshing.

Certain parties keep going healing nation, think important means lose spin doctoring, start laying things plain language. mean using racist language saying things piss people off. mean telling truth. Oh god see comment randomly awesome lol Everything single person commented thread agrees absolutely nuts. problem isn‚Äôt ‚Äúoverwhelming bad news‚Äù there‚Äôs mass phenomenon media illiteracy. People selective feeding anxieties it‚Äôs addicting while. It‚Äôs problem needs worked individual isn‚Äôt matter ‚Äúeverything going wrong‚Äù reality, isn‚Äôt.  Yes agree meam impossible. prof 15 years ago telling us mRNA vaccine pipe dream never expect see it. hope it, long someome paid enough. Yeah thought old people anyone else. think 80 year old father getting February, least hope he'll get February. keep hearing groups keep pushed ahead. Nothing makes sense. Um... Yes, can. ever seen action? gets anything right, chance efforts. going say, people praising Britain vaccinating 140 people minute. According Bloomberg article read USA vaccinating almost 850,000 people day comes 590 people minute. Good job countries. Thanks replies, wishing wife best. So, Covid plus ""other"" excess deaths around 460K+ whole point quick vaccine rollout protect risk population reduce burden hospitals. taking precautions means you‚Äôre low risk contracting virus potentially ending burdening hospital. Telling people Reddit you‚Äôre taking precautions might get preferential treatment, won‚Äôt outside here. reducing severity novel disease, risk get first dibs regardless background. thought collective individual... Absolutely. vaccination programme going well run NHS, Conservative Party, Johnson dodgy private company got contract without tender, reneged contractual obligations, fine know Dominic Raab's mum daft Tory shit. India Indonesia arguably done fairly well considering massive population sizes. 

Florida heavily air conditioned hot climate less relevant.

Brazil horrible public health response virus appears squandered advantage would otherwise related weather. announcement saying they're going invest people look coming plan. Far promise. They're vaccinating slowly...on purpose?

I know Europe perfect we're allowed criticize anything reddit, but....wow.  goes expected. Sure, however nursing homes low paid thankless jobs.  fire paid get replacements. legally staffing requirements.  Imagine half $10 hours CNAs quit, replace $17 hour LPN that's thats available. 

The vaccines emergency status.  legally fully fda approved.  

If Pfizer launched exact vaccine 2018, would approved use. doctor would lose license giving you.

Yup, 222nm solid state emitters commercially available right now. Even corona mess. One place worked two years ago forbade using pto october till february couldnt handle people taking off.

Thank answer. absolutely correct long term effects, something unfortunately well aware of. 17yr old daughter caught covid Christmas, tomorrow get results blood test still recovered. isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdoing you‚Äù. It‚Äôs responsibility others may still risk including children can‚Äôt get vaccinated. course it‚Äôs nonsense. probability getting vaccine zero icu nurse‚Äôs 1.

People really idea magnitude economical damage we're looking at. Last study make exact determination (78) 75 last Living Tokyo. less confirm article contents, seen crammed small restaurants bars grocery runs.

The title's awfully misleading though, none Japan legally ""lockdown"". read words closely. Quarantine hospital matter much hate word ""forceful quarantine"", still hospital root, get monitored professions, self monitored Amazon gadgets home.

Also, comparing Trump. meant sadly Trump, access best health care, admitted hospital even mild symptoms. 

No matter political show Trump put deny pandemic mask. must thinking ""thank god president always gauranteee bed"". age obesity made risky group, result would completely different Trump another average Joe.

But end, choice. like home infect household wish. shut up. It‚Äôs like indoor dining helps tax revenues. haven‚Äôt figured profit massive underground house parties.

I simply state state asked hospitals cut back elective procedures.

The world ending. vaccines now. logistics issue need availability.

But act like isn‚Äôt immense pressure applied healthcare system US sticking head sand.

Govts hospitals taking steps deal pressure applied.

And finally, people absolutely go hospital issues.  article ZERO data. It‚Äôs anecdotal. know. aggravating. would much like get back living. Please. Anything better stuck apartment dating fucking year. think fact wait 3 months doses AZ vaccine slow distribution? That's 5% vaccinated people.

2: undetected Covid cases deaths hands Biden opportunity start gate looking really good. second takes office, vaccination ramps things start get better.

Exactly. 320 million - antivax - people 18 - got recently UK numbers.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Average median way. I‚Äôve seen people confusing two metrics months. However; yes, COVID far deadly elderly population kids young/middle age adults We'll get vaccinated eventually then, Gall &amp; gall delivery  Press releases Sinovac really conclusive long technical data published peer reviewed.

Vaccinating health care workers cannot trial general public; however, mean efficacity higher. Efficacity calculated proportion infections vaccinated group placebo control group.

AZ claims 100% efficacity severe infections; however, since 2 severe cases control group, significant. Sinovac, even know test data. sure seemed like children neighborhood playing children even past summer. I'm sure parents restrictions, seeing group kids riding bikes running around streets together common sight. feeling little restrictions kids upcoming summer. too, option J&amp;J April versus Moderna/Pfizer August, I‚Äôll take faster option.

I‚Äôm closely exposed hundreds people per day work, 15% unmasked kids fictitiously medically mask exempt adults, faster better me. makes sense.

But think also agree /u/HarriJokker 's overall point. people dying Covid generally older good health. different example Spanish Flu 1918 average age reportedly 28, something like Opioid epidemic even lower. sure measure impact society seems like problems serious. think largely lost media make point seems going way report less likely cases young healthy people getting sick rather vast, vast majority people older health conditions. see 100 headlines ""healthy 45 year old father 3 dies"" ""healthy teen dies"" headlines ""Covid fatalities 1000 times common age 75 age 55"".

I suspect year higher excess morbidity going see years below-average morbidity since essentially front-loaded deaths people probably going die next 4-5 years anyway. Guess we'll see. Got Message. Mexican pendejo. Well russia also created vaccine ebola, No? knowledge must high level going follow path 100 years ago, virus contained, we'll heading war time? Fauci making living stating obvious now? feel like quotes make sub things halfway intelligent person could make conclusion on. Sure, UK population 63 million versus US 309 million. vaccinating fast enough, don‚Äôt nearly enough doses ordered shipped states. would shocked children died virus died drowning swimming pools Summer. particular virus concern part population. It'll great we're sure safe vaccinate kids, really important right now. fuck‚Äôs sake.. isn‚Äôt argument it‚Äôs fact. People die kinds things every day. vaccine doesn‚Äôt save people dying heart failure diabetes choking breakfast. people *who would died anyway unrelated cause* die shortly get vaccine. That‚Äôs happens vaccinate literally 1 million people day - unless believe vaccine somehow protects death entirely. good Moderna Pfizer could make even though talked much better game. sounds good me!! That‚Äôs 5% population. Well done.

Once again, think strategy get shots arms ASAP, worry much perfect prioritization. I‚Äôm pretty sure Florida took ‚Äúif you‚Äôre 65 come down‚Äù approach.

Oh, darn 67 year old get instead 87 year old? Whatever. It‚Äôs one less person end hospital covid-19. 

I wish jurisdictions would start moving direction. Cuomo walked back initial vaccine plan yet? ""proof"" people worked got sick fall. nobody works lab ever gets cold. So, publish it? custom google search time period find dozens similar articles.

I'm brit remember happened. Also note Farage part ruling party neither guy originally linked, part fringe right wing nutjobs.

I'm fan right wing government least going around calling 'wuha-n flu' 'chinese virus' like certain leaders US were, perhaps sort issues wrongly accusing others, particularly takes wrong.

The majority british public certainly approve Farage/UKIP. part disagree with? facts clear here. case you‚Äôre aware, pandemic happening. Regardless government still pandemic. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs fucking economy.  packed factory living cramped camps due poor people many babies? Yea, poor Indonesians one blame unfair work conditions. teach poor choosing poor.

Whats wrong you? Extremely unlikely. demographic virus fatal overwhelmingly elderly - age group dramatically smaller back then.

In addition, comorbidities tend result fatalities (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, etc), also dramatically less common back then.

If anything virus would barely noticed 100 years ago. You‚Äôre making false comparison here. Old frail enough possibly die vaccine mean every 65+ person died COVID also near death. 

 idea people died COVID death‚Äôs doorstep dangerous misinformation. havent seen john barron twitter parody account absolutely hysterical. tiny percentage population it‚Äôs irrelevant.
Or one pro restrictions diseases eradicated forever?

The entire reason restrictions worldwide flatten curve keep health systems collapsing. achieved containable justification restrictions people vaccinated... get four March, I'll confident go PAX East early June without mask. vaccines already getting daily shots healthy rate see end massive death numbers coming soon, hate four vaccines, including one shot vaccines, really think we'll pretty much done matter weeks.

We're already point people long term care facilities vaccinated, already multiple states million people vaccinated. Things looking good they're gonna start looking better. I'm really happy we're point comfortably say that. ‚Äúmakes u think twice mexico‚Äù... exactly problem u test asymptomatic people recent negative covid tests ... u get false positives harm people. chilling effect travel economy... covid rampant anyway US Keep correct pronunciation buddy! like get vaccine Python Java.

No, course don't. Furthermore even true that's *obviously* tiny fringe majority. 



The Cornerstone Republican's ability argue debate: find single example something population hundreds millions billions pretend like ridiculous thing thousand times widespread really One good thing UK, incredibly high vaccine acceptance among Western countries, especially vulnerable demographics. Spoiler alert: long term effects happen first year. de Blasio stating going ignore NYS rules, Cuomo probably would kept initial scheduling.

We need living wage US workers. correct, misread see that. However, don‚Äôt get ‚Äúasking random doctors‚Äù comment, much COVID fatigue going around. still need maintain vigilance err side caution. Step one get sub. lot people would love nothing us locked homes end time. 

I tell right zero chance social distancing COVID restrictions going last. one many states already enforcing rules, people get vaccinated less less people going wear masks stay inside.

Is reason believe could still could catch covid enough pass me? That‚Äôs I‚Äôm worried about. safe we‚Äôre concern know cautious. reasons pretty dumb. vaccines 95 percent effective, relatively safe wear mask social gatherings already gotten vaccine. need wait little while, ok that's valid, waiting take mask off. mean reach herd immunity stop distancing masking, maybe even vunerable get vaccinated. relatively safe distance wear masks people (except vunerable)   Shame vaccinating people spreading virus. understand we‚Äôre int order would probably end going route. think vaccinating working population around vulnerable might stop spread faster. mRNA seems cooler Sure case others reading wondering- even don‚Äôt symptoms, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs working. depends person. symptoms slight headache sore arm.

*insert Peter Griffin - Hell Cares meme* Fair point. I'm sure time goes we'll get clarity given trial protocols required whole lot blood-drawing (so test biomarkers ones links provided above).

But regardless, find hard believe vaccine 94-95% efficacy preventing symptomatic infection would poorer preventing overall infections vaccines 60, 70, 80% efficacy. Reinfections extremely uncommon, evidence increasingly points actual infection effective vaccination towards preventing disease. said, mom flying area many cases, area many cases, you‚Äôre yet vaccinated, think trip would ill advised you‚Äôre trying avoid Covid ‚ÄúAcross New York State, medical providers recent weeks story: forced throw precious vaccine doses difficulties finding patients matched precisely state‚Äôs strict vaccination guidelines ‚Äî steep penalties would face made point extra doses they‚Äôre trashing tons doses already hand? J&amp;J require people monitored anaphylaxis? Capacity high 800k apparently. Why?

Let private sector it. successfully efficiently every single year flu shots. studies way off, likely, truth closer average studies.

Tested deaths \* 100 excess deaths \* 200 probably provide lower upper bounds. Anything beyond involves significant guesswork. people 80... long vaccine becomes widespread enough United States us see similar headlines. US vaccines tested people showed symptoms trial. asymptomatic cases detected. AZ vaccine everyone tested weekly.

The key thing prevent serious covid. know compare asymptomatic cases. real solid reason, I'd rather get 2 shot mRNA vaccine choice. popularly called Wuhan virus spread world people learned memorize SARS-CoV-2. happen British virus. Mike Pompeo CIA spook would love nothing agitate international incident keep funding. Fuck him, credibility. must something population density though right?

Like UK large amount population concentrated small area assume easier get infrastructure rolling deliver them.

We (Canada) also supply problem rn. wealthy neighbor flew Florida get vaccine. elderly able get Florida right away. suspect bought spot. stinks Florida residents. anything virus would barely noticed 100 years ago.

Less people overweight, people. Less people older people. many people spent day two getting oxygen therapy released getting 1918 vast majority cases. good number would crater due low O2 levels. Hospitalizations might lower, outcomes hospital would worse. always return positive: 100% sensitivity. hope Biden coming Lion‚Äôs making Super Bowl next year!! ü§£üò¨ sticking 5 million day! stay immune though. Atm neither conclusive, reliable enough evidence people stay immune 21 days declared Pfizer. So, people vaccinated catch virus, virus chance adapt already existing antibodies point sufficient ‚Äò‚Äôkill‚Äù it. virus mutates voila, back square one. something like this, safe. might end turn worked, might catastrophically backfire. Also: don‚Äôt forget political pressure committee under. Like numbers look better, GB brag that. everything else going wrong moment, Johnson sure hell use good numbers.  waiting long (at best) limits effectiveness vaccine ""Your vaccine administered 7am 8pm""

Later day receive text saying ""your vaccine injected"" picture random teenager getting outside house. even though mom wears mask safe, got covid symptoms appeared December 28th. probably got boyfriend wasn‚Äôt feeling well time isn‚Äôt safe her.

Now she‚Äôs wanting come visit another state. She‚Äôs planning fly hang week. It‚Äôll first time seeing since moved here, safe this?

Her everyone work says ‚Äúwell can‚Äôt get 90 days you‚Äôll safe.‚Äù I‚Äôm concerned catching myself.

Anyone insight? Everything Donald Trump touches dies need anything said Next up, 10 reasons always wear masks forever unless part ruling class. Parsldon ignorance infection rate high L.A. thought strickt lockdown effect? decades ago Summer Winter olympics hosted year. understand would tragic happen again. instead doctors/hospitals, addition. Spanish complain Spanish flu called Spanish even though even originate Spain? America weeks, Engman thought recovered. Then, new problems set ""COVID caused abscesses lungs,"" Engman said.

That *can‚Äôt* chalked placebo, friend. know, paper figures come (this one: says nothing ""black communities"" ""low trust"" due ""historical issues unethical healthcare research‚Äù. That's either coming sage report, linked, Guardian themselves.

It does, however, points ""the rise vaccine hesitancy result misinformation safety coincides rise social media, growing platform anti-vaccination movement."" agree. nurses around wait months last positive test getting course!

Brits pronounce job You‚Äôre definitely wrong. guess think ideally people already COVID doing/healthy back line. US daily cases already seem peaked soon start drop. also started drop UK vaccination rate pretty good.

the beginning end here. really hope loosen lift mask mandates pretty soon. miss seeing people's smiling faces. never realized much negative effect brain get 2 doses vaccine basically good live normal life travel etc long wear mask sanitize- highly reduced risk contracting virus now? Meanwhile Americans still won‚Äôt get polio shot. Trump administration put vaccinations state. roll issues due individual state issues.

Usually make wait parking lot 10-15 minutes make sure feel fine. might get choice, deaths cases go they‚Äôll want people lockdown back work UK. Depends mean ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people high risk vaccinated I‚Äôm happy see restrictions lifted like able see friends like lower risk category small group like 3 us like places brief time first lockdown. 'vaccinated' requires TWO doses. numbers FIRST dose, providing one dose many people (who fully vaccinated) opposed completing vaccination flout numbers.

It great many people getting first dose. numbers vaccinated people, people received first initial dose. difference important doubts effectiveness two doses far apart UK gov providing them. sad part would've likely re-elected taken virus half seriously. enemy worry anyone sticking for. could go war. win it, keep pushing pressing people CDC said. 

Instead treated PR optics issue focused looked. Part intelligence realizing news feeding science anecdote spreading Nerves already wearing thin. goes without us even option get vaccinated, riots. homes, jobs marriages? 

That's fault Republicans giving us mature, rational serious Federal response. guys... silence. hear it?

It‚Äôs like baby crying 4 years finally fallen asleep.  know flu too, right? lots things, too. Life overall might little dangerous you. long real question? Nobody seems want ask logically speaking come point enough people vaccinated return normal even majority sub want to. Russian bot? California instituted strictest lockdowns country. LA locked since March. malls open. WhatBurger Texas. You‚Äôre thinking In-n-out? UK took data provided Pfizer Moderna approved without even pretending peer review it. 

Also UK trying vaccinate many people possible without taking account second dose vaccine. something happens chain distribution (Pfizer screwed week, example) millions UK miss second dose grants immunity. 
Other countries saving doses eventually vaccine roll slows down, still cover second dose need it.

UK's gamble paying God's sake idolise it.  believed due nerve inflammation known way speed recovery, however studies reported people recover inside weeks Good luck! instead convincing want vaccine take it, give vaccine want it. Stop wasting time doses.  hand sanitizer smells like straight alcohol too. Taste fine tho.

Lastly, vaccine may 50% efficient stopping people getting perhaps therefore spreading it, may stop people get getting bad symptoms. stop people going hospital much, helps healthcare capacity. They're also bringing students back person learning. Sounds like good idea me!

Does refer possible future variants? There‚Äôs many potential protein combinations bind ACE2 right? Shouldn‚Äôt vaccine work SARS-CoV-2 Variants, matter much change?

If not, quickly could mRNA payload reformulated attack new variant? read somewhere actual vaccine completed two days.

Would rebuild vaccine subjected clinical trials another year, could begin mass producing release immediately?

Also potential multi-payload mRNA vaccine shot could create S-Protein multiple known variant? Would immune response still effective multi-payload vaccine? would reduce efficacy exposing multiple variants?

For ex one strain = 95% efficacy. Would multi-variant vaccine produce 95% immunity variant B would drop maybe 60-70% either?

Should vaccine makers begin preemptively incorporating new variant immediately ongoing production lines, it‚Äôs spread becomes dominant?

The UK government call ""Wuhan virus"", reputable media outlets. 

Nice try whataboutism. Layman's here, far read

1. like genetic manipulation humans themselves, RNA. Viruses *manipulate* RNA time, like suddenly give cancer. mRNA injected still external affect cells protein production, mRNA long life, mRNAs

2. That's interesting, also trials made first place, assess security well looking efficacy. Could vaccine give autoimmune disease? widespread, it'd shown trials canceled vaccine(s). happen. make develop years time? think also unlikely, vaccine quickly ""consumed"", month antibodies came you, vaccine itself. months that's also troubling, safe. Could someone, rare instances, autoimmune disease vaccine? Possibly, maybe Miami (dead) doctor also did. rare viruses well trigger autoimmune conditions, even much frequently

3. much could. Vaccines based inactivated virus safe super duper tested, otherwise they're not. could give someone covid injecting really inactivated ""vaccine"" instance. Pharmaceutical industries working too, currently lagging behind vaccines really easier make mRNA ones. choose mRNA beautiful proved shorter time safe effective. Furthermore, inactivated viruses mimic cellular infection, ""half"" protect infection. probably robust response mRNA ones, also why, though, they're reactogenic majority people recover covid, like illnesses, without medical attention.

A small percentage people need ventilators recover, majority not. However, one always know advance need ventilator, won't. Staying quarantine facilities makes easier get medical attention, compared staying home. Furthermore, one could experience symptoms may rise level requiring ventilators. Again, medical facility makes easier get help, rather ambulance come house. Hey mods, removing HALF this? company created blue LED's, doubt would lie this. Yep.

UVC kills burning. Low power UVC nothing ...looks pretty, science, power (which gadgets find online) People fighting freedom suddenly idiots? idea much longer restrictions gonna place. Might 6 months. people really idiots wanting live lives treated like prisoners almost year. Kansas, frustrating. Paid sick days luxury. everyone dead? Personally, I'm hoping lot tech workflows used improve standard flu vaccine process. could improve lot reducing timeframe produce it, would let wait longer deciding exactly vaccine focus on, maybe even improve effectiveness.

And maybe we'll get vaccines diseases. reduction turnaround time research real authorization allows much faster return investment, huge factor. impression would good idea review entire way approve vaccines. great want hand ultra secure vaccines... new virus... pandemic... might cause reconsider things.

We slow start vaccinating real possibility SARS-CoV2 endemic remain so. means what? means already many genetic variations virus make irradication impossible. might good, we'll come new vaccines every year try control it. 

Humanity's average life expectancy alreay taken serious hit virus, might semi-permanent.

Had foresight see coming (epidemiologists, microbiologists, virologists, etc, saw coming eventually) could super-massive vaccine fabrication facilities world. could done small phase 1 animals, larger phase 2 humans (very well paid volunteers) including human-challenge test (give vaccine, give virus). could immediately started vaccinating billions people (in APRIL)!

Now better never, cost waited tremendous, lives economics. quite possibly new reality...

I understand ethics behind things like human-challenge vaccine trials... very... delicate... get it. I'm saying that, least, worth asking if, hindsight, migh better accelerate roll-outs much more? really help CDC appearently recommends people already Covid still take vaccine make sense all. 

In Germany, people virus told get vaccine because... well already protection. take dose away someone protection all. 

I seriously get it. generally start trustong ""medical"" experts less less sometimes say stuff far away reality insane. Thanks mention vaccine trials HIV showed people got experimental vaccine actually likely infected HIV. tricky virus. logistical nightmare That's like telling Hong Kongers year ago protest streets make China crack harder them. isn‚Äôt, measure direct metric rather one that‚Äôs apparently supposed imply infant mortality proxy Maybe get rehash roaring 20s yet taint remains... It‚Äôs bizarre, talking last week family member (PhD genetics) regulatory work FDA. said recent advances vaccine technology mRNA vaccines (COVID), wouldn‚Äôt surprised HIV vaccine next. called bullshit, right! Mandatory testing vaccines  kids spread schools rate close adults, would teachers infected similar higher rates others meet adults jobs.

I seen studies, one study Sweden indicated teachers *lower* infection rate comparable adults (neither teachers children masked still, least far know although voluntarily course). 

In all, still firmly think evidence points kids spread less/slower. doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúnot all‚Äù. doubt anyone anywhere claim that. opening schools shouldn‚Äôt conditional kids spreading virus all, unless ‚ÄúCovid zero strategy‚Äù (so definitely Europe US, example).

Closing schools still reasonable policy, even schools somewhat safe, still cut lots people public transport close schools, example. healthcare becoming strained every bit counts. closing schools cut R tiny bit, understand authorities that. 
People need understand though it‚Äôs black white. It‚Äôs argument whether kids spread not. wonder covid mom also involved traumatic machete wielding incidents.

 Jokes aside, wear masks folks, dont know enough long term effects covid take lightly. nearly ""working class"" jobs ""essential"" half population least worked every lockdown. meet hundreds people every day work, meet one friend week ""socializing"". Lockdown performative ""see, shops shut!"" mixing 99% continues cos work  like everything comes mouth. surprised? UV LEDs nothing new here. get faster...hang tough. Yep, that's means problem Bad bot ""camps"". place people brought put surveillance refuse follow mandatory home quarantine orders test positive. even close hint at, even close normal prison.

Basically plan use places refugees live decision asylum request made normal times. lot refugees right places often empty. might nice hotel home, suspect people would go week two refuse follow Covid rules people complain (completely made-up) fact apparently refugees Germany treated better Germans. Maybe they'll change mind maybe actually like living former refugee home think better home stick old talking points, we'll see. aware huge hacking operation spanning several months. HIV?!? Damn!

High-pressure tanning bed bulbs designed produce UVA light only. reality, also produce UVB dangerous UVC light, filters used block damaging rays.¬†

Without filter things used decontamination. Lyme, Lyme, want lyme vaccine! jealous! Borderline millenial here. Yup. good thing UK government done pandemic far letting NHS get vaccinations. Vaccination minister appointed 28 November clearly collect credit interfere. terrified going privatise jab like test trace.   think white house due another restoration. Maybe people would follow mask mandate clear evidence effectiveness. good evidence. Also, virus doesn¬¥t seem transmit much outdoors really seems like stupid ones ones wearing masks outside.

Wait, argument valid now? thought everything save grandma, lockdowns severe restrictions. every Mexican care Covid parties 100 family members time? Got it. CDC guessed 91 million back beginning December?
I really think true number lot higher 46 million, dont think catching half total cases covid.

That said, recent studies pinpointed wavelength UV-B 295nm production vitamin D3 humans minimal exposure D3 deficiency humans proven complication COVID-19.

The lights article 280nm border UV-C UV-B. actually something using wavelength kill viruses, would surprised.

From US FDA:

""UVB: evidence UVB radiation effective inactivating SARS viruses (not SARS-CoV-2). However, less effective UVC hazardous humans UVC radiation UVB radiation penetrate deeper skin eye.

September completely wrong. 7 day average deaths 3,700 currently. appear hit peak hospitalizations downturn. Yep really think people went worst case scenario beginning. rare, anecdotal cases formed everyone's opinion instilled fear.

40% Covid fatalities occur 0.6% population nursing homes, 1000 people die every day normal circumstances.

Another 40% occur primarily people aged 65+ health conditions small subset population.

Healthy 60 little risk always have.

Also, according logic child 90 year old cancer could treat one flip coin???? First, found outdoors associated higher emotional well-being, consistent pre-pandemic research benefits outdoors mental health [for reviews, see (Bowler et al. 2010; Collado et al. 2017; Frumkin et al. 2017; Hartig et al. 2014; Kondo et al. 2018; van den Bosch Bird 2018)]. various authors speculated, ability opportunity spend time outdoors may especially important conditions lockdown social-distancing (Burtscher et al. 2020; Samuelsson et al. 2020). results provide empirical evidence claims [see also (Lades et al. 2020)] and, although able examine whether specific outdoor environments particularly crucial, seems likely outdoors provides myriad opportunities improvements emotional well-being. may include opportunities physically psychologically escape stressors household confinement (e.g., lack personal space, boredom), maintain social relationships improve social capital, engage physical activity, develop sense connection world outside [for review, see (Samuelsson et al. 2020)]. course, outdoors presents risks terms limiting spread viruses [e.g., due overcrowding high-traffic zones; (Public Health England 2014)], risks managed effective risk-minimisation strategies [for review relation COVID-19, see (Freeman Eykelbosh addition, results present study suggest experience loneliness associated poorer emotional well-being. finding consistent research conducted prior COVID-19 pandemic indicating loneliness key risk factor poorer emotional well-being [e.g., (Cuenya et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 2007)], well cross-sectional data nations pandemic (2020; Losada-Baltar et al. 2020; Okruszek et al. 2020; Palgi et al. 2020). also consistent finding participants reported known unknown others vicinity daily assessments; is, conditions physical social distancing, surprising participants generally away others (although noted able compare descriptive data pre-pandemic levels), may heighten feelings loneliness (2020) that, turn, contribute poorer well-being. Beyond main effect, two findings worth highlighting vis-√†-vis loneliness. First, contrast recent commentary [emphasising impact older age loneliness; (Berg-Weger Morley 2020; Patel Clark-Ginsberg 2020)] cross-sectional findings [where younger participants reported feeling lonelier; (Losada-Baltar et al. 2020; Luchetti et al. 2020)], find participant age interacted loneliness impact well-being. Second, perhaps importantly, association loneliness well-being stronger indoors, highlights benefits results also suggested greater daily screen-time associated poorer emotional well-being, although effects comparatively weaker outdoors loneliness, respectively. Interestingly, effect screen-time well-being indirectly influenced loneliness outdoors shaping well-being. Explaining effect difficult absence additional data screen usage, might speculated screen-time proxy exposure potentially stressful coverage COVID-19 pandemic [see (Huckins et al. 2020)], could heighten distress [for pre-pandemic findings, see (Pfefferbaum et al. 2014; Vance et al. 2018)]. Another possibility measure screen-time captured leisure non-leisure (e.g., work, studying) screen activities, detrimental effect latter outweighs positive effect using screens leisure (e.g., communicating others, relaxation). also worth noting that, correlational analyses, greater screen-time significantly associated higher loneliness, suggests that‚Äîunder conditions lockdown‚Äîscreen-time per se may necessarily effective means buffering feelings isolation. mean kind makes sense.

It's uncommon 30% even 50% long-term care facility residents die within couple weeks there's Covid outbreak facility. That's normal even places lots old people like that.

Now much less 1% frail elderly die shortly get vaccinated. Maybe vaccine contributed deaths needs investigated, maybe vaccination risk groups needs re-evaluated turns vaccine dangerous hoped groups. rate, explanation might actually ""they would died anyway within couple days weeks"" time. mean argument true Covid deaths (could still true like 10% Covid deaths course). anyone know difference first 2 shots is? 70 It‚Äôs almost need single person get TV says ‚Äúguys, hold months get back life. know nobody wants distancing wearing masks much longer. give us June get damn shot offered‚Äù
Instead get fungible timelines scare tactics. I'm glad psychological break, we're even there. arguing even know why. Meanwhile USA may enough doses spreading faster vaccinate shitty businessman electoral vote once. Imagine defending career politicians. me. UK response awful long time. conservative government took long time ban flights enforce lockdowns apparently pursuing unofficial policy herd immunity.

We told wear facemasks months start pandemic highest death toll Europe. Maybe populations take ivermectin systems? Lots ventilation/living almost outdoors helps lot. get 30% from? parent child go school knows great kids spreading diseases kids bringing illness home Mom, Dad siblings. Ignoring idea everyone locked inside forever, that's awful, guys job ride bike. ""It's millions millions mythical non-mask wearers perpetually covid keep spreading it!"" Facebook removed app stores right? world wide fear people keep getting vaccination. 

Hope not. way last year bit going I'd put past life. Where? Assuming gives powerful immunity. limit vaccine supply. know AstraZeneca said could provide 2M doses week sure others, definitely many AstraZeneca Since March 2020. sure, NYC could too, except locked SUPER hard despite massive protests businesses usual obligatory religious nuts. Please vaccinate smokers make quit.  may outdoors, virus spreads via particles expelled lungs. someone covid smoking outside, come along smell it, chance(I know large small, probably depends proximity), could contract covid them. Im planning studying abroad summer rome. Start date July 15th. Think happens? thought pushing back AZ approval due data irregularities dosing. California counties reported 32,904 new cases 418 new deaths Saturday total 2,951,682 cases 33,391 deaths. think vaccine approved 16 under, really like 210-250 million people America helps little bit. gran got 1st (Oxford) days ago. Basically said we'll call need come back 2nd. they're talking 12 weeks.

IIRC efficacy ~50% one dose although better nothing great. whole dosing regime properly tested shoot dark effective is. second could bump 90%+ nothing   would certainly major stimulus service department shortwave UV would quickly degrade plastic components. charged 1000x more, might helped make small difference rest us struggling pay Healthcare swear Healthcare #1 reason Gofundme exists. Well, told calling Wuhan virus wrong. wrong, okay now? Cuz everyone's fucking hypocrite, that's why. born here. spend much time France Ireland. stuck UK seven months hated every second. anti-gym SoCal summer/fall, given nonchalant ppl become, shopping malls filled, ppl lined stores, unmasked patrons, parties every weekend, working 30 40 minutes Outdoors way safer, especially mask. People socialize chat workouts, like gathering friends outdoor bbq hitting Zara sale girlfriends. importantly, outdoor gyms i've seen, patrons respect distancing. definitely Costco malls. vaccine? AstraZeneca? Summer 2021 normal places started vaccinating, assuming 4 vaccine candidates approved.

I've seen redditors sayinf summer 2021 like summer 2020 genuinely dont understand logic likely majority population vaccinated could upwards 5 vaccines Novax checks out...

Its like people want go forever. think problem production shipping, actual administration jaaaaaaaag? agree, upto: ""As corona proteine replicant human made, would impossible proteines get assaulted immuno process."" Oh, wowie, thanks. know people everywhere. Warning labels decorative decals. guess pays rich richest country world. Amazon, FedEx, etc. better National Guard? seem like whole lot product move around several months. Yes course. article specifically mentions America though. Hope also change toilet seats Also, Biden called 100M vaccines first 100 days. hope means plans start counting Jan 20 beyond. every vaccine counts, 100M 100 days BIG milestone regards pace. math, works could vaccinate every American end 2021. It‚Äôs great people getting vaccine, ratio new vaccinations new infections useful?

Seems like two important statistics, related way that, say, rates new infection, recovery, death would be. wish could confident state leaders, CA least everyone's passing buck back forth state local government since beginning pandemic. We're rolling slowly nobody knows charge whose red tape follow. [Yes Planned start next 10 days. navy medics administering vaccines Bristol, imagine cities far behind first. thought horrendous heresy people Indians Irish people peacefully protesting right self-determination? know (the us) that? Take wild guess lol  one responding seems know pandemic is. would say first half YEAR. even possible?

Hong Kong incredibly densely populated yet hardly anyone gotten virus.

For record, mask use great Hong Kong. live (New Territories) tons people wearing masks.

What's going LA? 885 new cases/million inhabitans Mid-feb maybe, end feb definitely bathrooms. Lol literally site filled trash. *Rich people everywhere 30% people get COVID-19 end long-haulers.

I suggest avoiding indoor part gym, altogether. It‚Äôs extremely risky, step inside place people wearing masks, huffing puffing air (heat/cooling) recirculating.

You close end. wait bit. Devolved health authorities think happening America, I've got news  going say believe crossed 400,000 deaths, COVID nowhere close done killing people USA stupid anti mask people keep spreading making things worse. even WANT know we'll hit 500,000 600,000. need two vaccinations within two weeks. Pfizer 3 Moderna 4.  thing stopping fake news scaring people, already happening also keep mind set goal months ago, vaccinations rocky start. Probably seemed bit ambitious then. nitpicking point Ignore science research done. guest.  smoke, trying get version covid takes longer kill you. pandemic relevent ""very poor countries"". true, would shitload ""pandemics"". 24 hours thing going ahead? Got it. Thank you! Lol look like fakes. Okay makes sense draw 

Is East Coast drawer?  Meanwhile Ireland go slow. get bag 410 nm LEDs China 5 bucks. problem driving higher intensities burns up. article money-grab. seen stupid wall-mounted LED ""disinfection"" units diodes driven super low levels pandemic people understand LEDs work versus traditional UVC bulb. article like comes everyone rushes buy something work.

If want really helpful resources LEDs driver circuitry, great resources you. 96% getting downvoted? So. Wrong!ü§£ü§£ü§£ Jan 4th considered ‚Äúrecently reaffirmed‚Äù? need Moderna put daily reaffirmation? Yeah agreed pay money get vaccines.  mounting evidence reinfection rare.

Yeah people mounting evidence entire year possible, hard hit countries hitting huge spikes again. got rapid test (negative) person said test 96% accurate slightly accurate pcr. true? Exactly. can‚Äôt vaccinate people supply vaccines. provinces running federal government way speed delivery timeline. provinces vaccinating fast possible don‚Äôt supply feds. 

Our September goal still possible, need increase supply sharply. AZ J&amp;J help that. Perhaps. doubt first dose provides level protection. 12 months time going impossible tell many lives would lost kept 21 day regime thus preventing people getting 1st dose time. 

Let's agree hope works best.

Edit: spelling Take look recent results conspiracies misinformation. capitol building invasion. happen itself. gonna track misinformed uneducated way prison complex serve sentence actions done due brain washing.  positives think of; 

Furlough, business support, testing, genome sequencing, refusing EU vaccine programme, refusing EU procurement program, buying vaccines early enough getting army help NHS vaccines. someone uses ebike, would say really depends. Drivers seeming nearly reckless months ago, everyone roadraging, far bicycling goes, really depends go. go like midnight 2 hour ride nights. much much safer going noon, 8am, 5pm experience. depends going consider safe ability level. sounds like might ride. comparison, safe go outside all? might trip fall crack sidewalk. Depending age, might break hip. Best stay inside forever? rules obey keep safe Covid. rules obey keep riding biking walking running diving. world full others thing, ""accidents"" may happen.  It‚Äôs extremely risky. People huffing puffing air (heat/cooling) recirculated inside. Yes hopefully vaccination rate continue increase, maybe point everyone twice original time frame

I know enough longevity vaccine last ~1 year think required full time vaccination programme everyone done rolling yearly basis (I'm optimistic lasting immunity though) United Kingdom worst country Earth. astounds bombed oblivion every civilised nation Earth already. Nothing value would lost.

Lol, reject visa application? üòÇüòÇ Canada  tell flu season. 
Last year healthiest terms contracting common cold. 

Touch wood. Lol. China, China fuck themselves. us, cmon need better naming scheme, stigma.  I'm sure. would depend cases. Maybe fall. US continues vaccinate (and likely get better Biden's plan) increase vaccination rates here, maybe even summer? Maybe rules draconian oppressive, they'd willing follow them. He‚Äôs right though....the percentages see thrown around percent people gotten vaccine able infected. 

Of course still benefit get infected, there‚Äôs real way quantifying you‚Äôre 80% immune something.  I‚Äôm gonna wear mask go shopping indoors that‚Äôs it! I‚Äôm concerned transmission seems highly unlikely anyway. needs happen countries, I've waiting year travel internationally. happened choose worst possible time recent history start long distance relationship. care need quarantine 2 weeks, get tested virus multiple times day, get vaccine. Whatever allow travel again. Bet think clever...  express? Say get pcr tested today negative, negative? exposed 7 days ago problem politicians already used line way back March. they've lost credibility. Especially jackasses like Gavin Newsom who've hypocritical social distancing Yeah UK, Bucks. They‚Äôve told us book wait called forward. People like stopping telling people take seriously worry it. dismissing fanciful take it. invalid harmful. zero impact math. main point entire U.S. population would 600+ million (not 300+ million doses). 100 million 100 days would put us pace vaccinate entire population 2 years--way slow.

Yes, understand entire population get vaccinated, yes, understand start first 100 days slower end, point remains. U.S. need vaccinations/day 2-4 million range want put behind us reasonable amount time.

We 400 million Pfizer/Moderna doses end July, plus potentially many doses AZ J+J. (or least, should) embarrassment let distribution bottleneck. Far new, thanks. I'd rather hope sensible agenda ""It'll go away own"" plan previously. admit fascinated right wing talking point says ""Covid less lethal CDC etc saying"" reasons 

1] Statistics meaningful comparison. began deaths/positive test. Changing measurement deaths/population ""estimated"" contracted Covid useless assess effectiveness mitigation. mention ""estimated"" problematic ""garbage in/garbage out"" sense.

2] difference make whether ""more accurate"" measure lethality used? issue need reduce stress healthcare system certainly resulting deaths necessary triage performed. tools social distancing/masks treatments [which getting better fewer cases treatments could used everyone]

3] Finally, deaths hardly effect Covid bodies. credible reports lung/heart/brain damage even asymptomatic cases. mention folks survive days ventilator, necessary sedation, suffering major health effects show ""death rates"" matter measured referenced easy get produce UV light unhelpful disinfecting surfaces way products sold claim are, like OP's article.

Meanwhile talking UV LEDs knowledge constant-current supply even operates.

And.. even read article posted? using culminated lenses LEDs running 40W, even exposure took 20 minutes. 

It well-known products available consumers even commercially little effect enivonmental conditions, especially air. Quit rest scam industey referencing papers never read claiming knowledge topic little-to-no actual understanding works.

The science paper linked. Read it. east coast.

UK. use chest drawers, drawers furniture.

They contain draws

But drawers also underwear. That‚Äôs workers activists never let get something, there‚Äôs always tug pull business workers. There‚Äôs lot misinformation going around based people misinterpreting studies. assume articles saw figure people testing positive 14 days assumed meant still contagious. Everything I‚Äôve seen suggested 10 day isolation period symptoms begin science based strategy.


 ‚ÄúIn fact, CDC‚Äôs preliminary conclusion ‚Äúthe statistically estimated likelihood recovering replication-competent virus approaches zero 10 days three days recovery.‚Äù‚Äù

The study says never even found viable virus people mild-moderate symptoms 10 days symptoms begin. Like, maybe concerts masks lower capacity? 

But can‚Äôt see jam packed mask-less venues maybe time next year? Maybe spring? Plus run NHS contracted private companies like lot stuff went wrong was. Ha, guys would vote Mayo Clinic: Yeah. like deadly radiation.  Yes, Brazil different problem countries.

Brazil quickly shot 3% stop. infrastructure built. problem lack vaccines.

Brazil already infrastructure vaccinated millions people everyday. hear ya! Three days hopefully start see improvement! CDC figures necessarily reflect cases reported individual states.

406.249 deaths right now, according Worldometers. likely reach 408.000 tomorrow. folks live city 150-200k

I think every area going different really can‚Äôt say things going state level both? cute imaginary friend got Children main concern here. concern children spreading older high risk people. Children high risk low minority. need weigh risk determine precautions want continue take. holding everyone else back living normal life. That‚Äôs thought. Thank you!  Universities classes like 20-30 people likely mostly normal Fall, probably kind testing plan proof vaccination. 

Universities majority classes giant lecture halls likely gonna continue hybrid school/staggered schedules till 2022. ""Baby Baby"" song band Corona. So...now know. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 100's Mcdonalds Manchester choose go Uttoxeter? Bullshit like pinning hopes Covid vaccine, here's dose get real. vaccine work magic,

People probably killed due lefty vultures. fucking laws fake news. actually happens, light quite visible March, getting closer. bit longer! Canada's handling virus really bad? everything open except concerts maybe

*sigh* really miss live entertainment job 100 Million J&amp;J(which equal 200 million doses vaccines 1 shot regimen)

That's bit odd way phrase it. Realistically halve numbers, double J&amp;J.  80-90% hospitalizations fatalities occur 12-15% population 65+ pre-existing conditions. hospitalizations fatalities 80% lower would longer public health crisis.  Oh yeah sorry don‚Äôt know threshold That's problem. shortage nursing home workers? know it‚Äôs beyond tiresome hear current administration‚Äôs failures roll vaccines really needed direction national-level team power cut red tape quickly. 

State healthcare systems already overburdened dealing pandemic they‚Äôre suddenly responsible instantly organizing unprecedented inoculation campaign? Sounds like seasonal job NYC got way less pleasant work minimum wage went up... partially agree, can't blame goes wrong, give credit things go right Giggity Stop drinking koolaid  Tell Americans throw masks trash parties line enthusiastically get shot. understand point made? Sounds kinda like COVID-19 death rate tbh vulnerable population Covid identified, age 65+ pre-existing health conditions. people overwhelmingly get sick everyone else. 80-90% hospitalizations fatalities 12-15% article shows data broken age comorbidities shows highest risk age/health group literally 50,000 times greater risk youngest. Bet they're loving it. UK, I'm always told European countries better social systems. Statutory Sick Pay UK ¬£95.85 week, low.  think capitols really beefing security national guard deployed stuff. It‚Äôs gonna day sure though hopefully bad Oxford may central plan UK spread bets across vaccines tune 300million doses country needing c.110m adult population.

The UK also put guaranteed weekly delivery amounts contracts means every vaccine gets approved adds already significant supply. March UK 5m doses week available Pfizer, Oxford J&amp;J. dismissing throwing label negative way. What‚Äôs solution all? Hopefully things change, people work home often.

Just get couple days week work would perfect.

It would ease many issues.

Let fathers kids more. Working mothers better balance.

Less traffic. Less pollution. Less stress. think we're seeing lot people like reddit already They're I'm sure Brazil trouble administering vaccines, worried getting enough doses.

My understanding ANVISA approving chinese-manufactured CoronaVac Butantan manufactured doses. bummer 10million J&amp;J doses 10million patients opposed 5million Pfizer/Moderna. Edit: Also, J&amp;J trialing several different dosage levels possible low-dose efficacious get injections vials high-dose? We've averaged 850k per day last week, seem likely number bump 1M day May   see work pulling shit. like minded coworkers go get vaccine soon offered. Trump crowd refuses cajoled rewarded. get nothing, get treated like special little babies perks. Fuck yes. Give that. Inject arm phone too. Covid, incredibly anxious use public facilities. guy going store sanitizer wipes. everything gets clean along. hope improved standard hygiene persists. longest continuous lockdown USA? explosion Calif√≥rnia shows lenght lockdown variable slow spread long term. maybe yes? Pringles, Lays? I'm pretty sure I've seen ""100 million doses"" 50 million people want feel way too, issues that. We're seeing lot data showing things like lung fibroses, myocarditis, blood vessel damage people it, including asymptomatic/mild cases.

I'm hoping strong efficacy signals J&amp;J me, ""just mild case"" something feel great about. Yea honestly who's say politicians arent pocketing vaccines redistributing highest bidder anyways. Florida, county, I've single goddam news vaccine.

Edit: places Florida reported vaccinations, shit show anyways trying register. 
Source: babysitter's 70's still can't register get vaccinated cos every fucking time go ""website"" they're already done day. fixed typo. better typo in.  Sorry, specific referencing things going USA. haven‚Äôt approved AstraZeneca

Edit: obviously England success rolling vaccine program compared USA  you‚Äôre assuming covid affects patients equally. I‚Äôd rather give vaccine 90 year old child since child exponentially likely survive disease take active measures prevent getting it. Coronavirus cancer, affects older people much harder. Less conformable get medical attention needed.

He‚Äôs still neo-liberal war hawk supported Iraq war W that.

Not saying hope, it‚Äôs truth ‚Äú study found Covid survivors nearly three half times likely readmitted hospital, die, 140 days timeframe hospital outpatients.

Prof Khunti said team surprised find many people going back new diagnosis, many developed heart, kidney liver problems, well diabetes.

He said important make sure people placed protective therapies, statins aspirin.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs Covid destroyed beta cells make insulin get Type 1 diabetes, whether causes insulin resistance, develop Type 2, seeing surprising new diagnoses diabetes,‚Äù added.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen studies survivors MRS scans they‚Äôve cardiac problems liver 500 Million AZ

100 Million J&amp;J(which equal 200 million doses vaccines 1 shot regimen) That‚Äôs pandemic is. almost like want seen caring pandemic actually want fix it.  Salt circle around perimeter think different every person. saw article said somewhere 20-40% people still contagious 14 days. quarantine guideline lowered 10 days effort get people report scared losing job 2 weeks. many factors depending severity, immune response, etc. think way 0% chance contagious would get negative result. Yeah agree injected plasma worsen issue since 1. pretty proven work 2. gives virus work with... antibodies. heard, antibodies still add troubles virus, treatment efficient enough, kind allows selections antibody resistant mutations... Add people treated months. virus chance mutate, actually implicit goal, bound antibodies. plasma already proven good curing/treating disease‚Äîlayman's opinion here‚Äîwhy using yet, cultures antibody-resistant variants? Last year particularly big gust sand Sahara made friend's allergies act Texas. crazy wide effects are. Well, upside downside, February short month! killed reaching herd immunity. 


The actual date reach herd immunity go unnoticed scientists debate years exactly happened using various papers models. 


Long get point, COVID barely noticeable levels. don‚Äôt know answer that. We‚Äôre ‚Äúnormal times,‚Äù many people hospital take in. feel make decision lives dies, live decision. 

I‚Äôm going I‚Äôve since March stay home. It‚Äôs killing it‚Äôs killing anyone else. I‚Äôll get vaccine soon enough go around. worked independent living facility mandated us part initial requirements employment. flu lol. cant imagine they'd much trouble making mandatory thing retain employment. EU also banked lot Oxford/AZ (to tune 400 million doses) haven‚Äôt approved yet. I‚Äôm curious knows not. I‚Äôm one shot trial got call week two ago double check one medical background questions answered. I‚Äôll infer cleaning data analysis since first week January I‚Äôm waiting hear efficacy like everyone else!   want best vaccine get. people want happens two different things, one, biggest, pro adaptable species. wonder biased. fuckin bot removes anything ""it classes opinion"". Oh great. bot actually decides difference personal opinion true fact alters whole thread accordingly. That's fuckin mental ! 
 
I thought would open minded place discussion subject.

Everyone goddamn critic.

But reaction precisely Asian countries vindicated priorities vaccine rollout. defined bacteria single-celled...

Huh? You‚Äôre good know mean, I'm France there's huge number people unwilling take vaccine, even mother (I've tried convince gave up). idea what's going happen, government (or employers) make vaccine mandatory, say fuck reopen anyway, maintain restricitions people voluntarily take vaccine? hope latter. 1. article December information changed. never said there's vaccines coming, information many. That's pretty major distinction quite frankly disingenuous strawman. Like point out, found week vaccines, article December 18th relevant. count 2,000 hand actually stock they'll blow 24 hours easily.

2. systems largely provided Ochsner cannot get vaccine Ochsner right now. 100,000 appointments they've said stop administering vaccines Wednesday.

That hiccup anything Biden take time mobilize. I'm sorry, i'm trying intentionally obstinate, pretty major fuck definitely miscategorizing words. J&amp;J vaccine different viral vector vaccines. like 1 dose magically effective 2 doses another vaccine. People sub need stop acting like advantage. J&amp;J tested different protocol manufacturers all. there's every reason assume regret since simultaneously started 2 dose trial. (closely related) measures show difference except one prove something wrong study - suggests it. Based multiple outcome measures used matching up, good outcome, replication definitely next step.

Yeah,  Since thing measured rare enough total deaths 4 makes fluke experimental flaw easier explanation.

whatever number, matters p right?  certainly possible drug prevent death without directly fighting infection improving patient condition - hard imagine.

Many people die unable fight virus, complications so, right? 

The ""invasive ventilation"" first outcome shows clear benefit. stretch imagine ivermectin helps prevent whatever causes people need invasive ventilation? (honest question; clue proposed mechanism action, ivermectin does, evidence like previous studies). hold couple months, long industry trade running. Tourism restaurants suffering massively one part economy, would suffer anyway even milder lockdown.

Surely it'd different supposed go another year. know quite people vaccinations mother managing team vaccinating. feel inclined believe people Matt Hancock. Honestly yeah one family. ‚ÄúMasks forever, go concerts virtual exists, life great change?‚Äù cancer legit reason cautious. She‚Äôs also extremely touch thinks ‚Äúcrime must way since everyone‚Äôs sheltering‚Äù. Uh, nope, never leave house! intentionally unintentionally ignoring fact thread youre replying driven guy severe long duration symptoms recovery? words, really lending relevance here, seems like. guy saying everyone trying scare him, entire thread OP correct, no? words, credibly seek medical checkups, telling everybody afraid instead focusing practical objective reality potential subsequent necessities. forgot mention part say severity lasting symptoms highly correlated severity illness virus. That's like saying thay femur shattered thousand pieces industrial machine gonna take longer recover fall tree linear fracture everyone sent Prince Mabulla 1,000 dollars able free refrigerated crates vaccine customs. Ha ha, New Jersey, governor basically opened general population without tiers saying smokers next line, course everyone said smoke vaccines go right away anyone advance knowledge vaccines go. put smokers ahead teachers wants schools open. Suddenly one coordinate anything comes giving vaccine, despite hoards government workers whose job coordinate.   Actually J&amp;J expected 21st. True want chronic illness...... particularly warped sense taste/smell. yea -need- max efficiency. See /r/Covid19positive Ridiculous, people work care sector care others. 
This comeplete opposite fired rewarded Mine painless. US regulatory assessment based US trial, shouldn‚Äôt issues. Realistically it‚Äôs one give rest world reliable efficacy figure - trials bit messy. XD would ever vaccinate people? Surely matter get infected then? apple logic: patients ‚Äúdied covid-19‚Äù elderly people host medical problems got infected. average person getting infected seem danger. us largely lot Republicans southern nutjobs actually want vaccines, they're antivaxxers they're sitting freezers touched. Yep exactly. studio several years moved w/ old work friend turned south guy moved in. background check reference contacting performed. Landlord's 1st time renting someone personal friend / established professional (who could WFH'ed) definitely learning experience us.

I dreading almost year course would happen couple months I'd receive vaccine. known better, fault taking action earlier. think going last 20-40 years. tells everything need know

Canada getting 7-8k cases per day 20-30k vaccinations per day. 

Which puts us 3-5 new vaccinations every 1 new case.

2021 still needs great year, virus doesn‚Äôt lend well need, since stuck restrictions first 6-8 months, wether means business closures mask/distancing mandates. tips make 2021 fun meaningful, despite that.

#Find variety fun activities, hobbies, goals lockdown.

- __Gaming:__ Play games friends, online, yourself.

Set something would like accomplish actually achieve it. it, give something distract fact restricted life moment.

#Choose deal masks distancing much 2021.

Obviously still going mask distance grocery store bank, work school aren‚Äôt home. masks distancing cumbersome don‚Äôt equal great year. So, stay home much possible don‚Äôt even masking distancing, don‚Äôt non essential in-person activities. can, use delivery services things order. bonus, reduce COVID spread even more, _ending restrictions sooner._ Staying home best way stay safe, don‚Äôt even deal masks distancing. __That‚Äôs said get hobbies activities, since think fun home much better going somewhere fun mask dealing distancing, can‚Äôt even enjoy yourself.__

#Stay news unless personally impacts YOU.

Unless news personally impacts you, like vaccines available age/risk/work group, tightening loosening restrictions area, don‚Äôt need need news stressing out. Stay news, glad living right now, able enjoy hobbies, job, life. Limit news trusted sources, don‚Äôt click articles unless indicate it‚Äôs something impacts personally.

#Socialize online.

I know online socializing isn‚Äôt person, it‚Äôs risk-free way socialize stuff others.
- video chat fan, try communication methods. Set Discord server friends and/or family talk send photos hobbies time home. even add bots server games Pok√©mon chess. Another option good old fashioned phone call. get live connection without overwhelmingness video calls.
- don‚Äôt mind video calls, virtual game nights playing video board games online, online dinner party, hobbies together like cooking drawing, host virtual book club, even watch Netflix together using Netflix Party. chat quarantine. I'm sorry saying false. lost taste last week got test booked 30mins later. Got negative result next day. know plenty people many tests feel unwell symptoms. government fucked many things last year, come let's lie 4 day grace period, ok. Plus, listen institution, reddit üòâ LA use huge period prepare lmfao

Also Wuhan didnt entire infected country seed virus throughout city place originated might enough sequencing+testing confirm there. take lot countries possible list. There's still lot left. mean let's ignore everything asked since want answer. 
Do think two million people 70% protection think one million 70% protection see happens million?  
Do Trump approach see hey could worse already gave one million 4% population Texas. I'm saying report them, I'm saying produce official, fact-checked cited deaths whole country around 10 years. Every one articles collecting self-reported numbers hospitals, like every country right now, final tally much later. 

The reason try account missing unknown cases, lot people commit welfare fraud, collecting money dead family members get caught. rule instituted sometime prior 1995 Kobe quake, big deal numbers released 2005. living back remember official announcements news big deal made it. I'm hoping case promise deliver. would refreshing given much opposite we've last year. Erm crematoriums usually busy?? Death natural thing! needs immune upgrade rather simple antibody response  Yeah. One buddies erie talks every often they've whole. get computer I'll post idexx site see process. every day sample I'm sure we'd get discount. remember first sample sent said 400ish 770. Got 1600 had. couple non detects 800. thought weird got essentially zero times like said probably something best done every day. Ah fair enough thought end December 2019 actually 31st January 2020. Still though, didn‚Äôt order vaccines leaving, already left, point. think plan 100 fully vaccinated, 200 million plus doses current vaccine. also think low bar, something achieve easily boost confidence new administration Anti-science political parties exist around world, yes.

What exactly trying argue here? This. We're already million vaccinations day negativity endless, gets clicks. told July we'd two approved vaccines 11 million vaccinated mid-January, I'd blown away. We'll probably 3-5 million vaccinations per day April via 4 vaccines, still slow. recalling correctly. :) dont like comments purpose. not. People crying wolf unabated spread throughout schools wanted asymptomatic testing blamed schools opening massive spike community cases. came super low number anyways. Half cases came **one** school way. Many schools 0 cases whatsoever including ones Ottawa hotspot time.

The detractors realize numbers already starting trend mid late August continued increase Sept 7 school would've impact numbers considering 6 7 day incubation period average. one also explain massive spike test positivity Christmas break children. Gee, thought home supposed help reduce spread. Maybe work households mixing including grandpa grandma come help take care kids remote learning. Please could link it? Sounds interesting. must slept think money social construct

You ""logistically get people vaccinated"" ""return normal"". 

Once high-risk groups vaccinated, bad flu. Would restrict course lives substantially bad flu?

Even *were* true, US vaccinating much faster pace Canada, access supply faster Canada. UK currently vaccinates one time Pfizer vaccine. Originally planed get second time. second shot, provoke mutation unaffected current vaccine. last Pfizer one. thought second dose microchip it? long vaccines run 60% denies line Maudib masks!

Edit. stupid gotten. Yeah, know. screenshotted that, lol. right next other. good tracker this? Worldometer hasn‚Äôt added yet don‚Äôt think following statistics. data Pfizer paper published NEJM clearly showed first dose basically anything much. second dose counts. I'm impressed everyone across pond, US scary. England's response amazing, I'm envious, happy guys &lt;3 would call if:

- far less doses ordered two best vaccines whole lot really bad working vaccine (at least comparison) even approved yet. 

- negotiated maximum time delivery, leading ultimately fact, EU countries vaccinating people speed they'd finished 2024 

- everyone little bit interested whole vaccination -development -testing process, knew latest August main bottleneck production capacities.... 
.. still EU nothing negotiate production-under-licence-contracts Pfizer Moderna one side third parties who'd theoretically required resources (or easily upgrade plants them) produce vaccine side.. 

.. would call that?
Sorry.. personally call big fail. True, mean take anything away NHS. topic Vaccines. military huge amount make happen, get credit specific thing. Erm, hi, sorry, talk therapy different kinds therapy? Also, kinds therapy there? need Kwisatz Haderach! God. Pretty sure correct. Creampie makes babies. Boris batshit, Tories right wing. I'd bet Boris even caring right/left wing. I'm best vaccinator UFC! if... like double-negative turns straight? Mississippi one, IIRC. Canada also uses military way slower would imagine, ab currently like 35k shots medical professionals Ontario would take 5-10 vaccinate population continue current rate you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs okay people die something restrictions? likely take ICU bed get COVID-19, get vaccine first. matter rewarding bad decisions. matter best everyone, prioritize people (which now), ones likely suffer most, ones likely need already limited hospital care preventa total collapse. question: person like that?

Anyone know endogenous control means context? Little bit confusing include results sheet. Anyone else bothered discrepancy life expectancies race? study projected life expectancy Black people drop 2.1 years, 72.78 years, life expectancy Latino people drop 3.05 years, 78.77 years. contrast, life expectancy white people projected decline 0.68 years 77.84 years. rate growth MA, NJ, NY, despite likely much higher percentage immunity, make seem less likely. They'll get immunity *and* maintain restrictions get there. bigger factor probably warmer weather coming spring. sill ever get living 78 years instead 79? anti vaxx Europe apparently that's tragic. people going jail this?

Yes. see epidemiologists Twitter. think enjoy power get telling people allowed allowed live normally.

Lately saying evidence can't spread virus vaccinated. Also see saying people keep wearing masks fight flu.

So yes, supposedly ""smart"" people saying things like this, touch people's unwillingness live like indefinitely. shouldn‚Äôt do, reducing spread virus reduce possibility mutations occurring. 95% recovered three weeks, remaining 5% after. recovered yet (like lady article), necessarily permanent even 10 months. know people who've got diseases recovered multiple years. there‚Äôs science suggests delaying 12 weeks isn‚Äôt good idea.

[Citation needed]

The thing I've seen basically people stating ""Yea test happens increase time doses"", testing based 4 weeks second booster.

Overall there's probably reason would provide benefits, vaccinations boosters delayed years. Oh no! Oh no!
*kool aid man enters .... OH YEAH! mean couple comments someone talking like that. literally need look. &amp;#x200B;

4x vax = 25% positivity rate. How.. like Univeral healthcare system how? point phases keep hospital beds open save lives. life isn‚Äôt important smokers life.

Deamped Notable look new Zealand Australia statistician- there‚Äôs something highly suspect this.

Basically compared 8 countries mandatory lockdowns, 2 countries not:

Sweden North Korea

They provide analysis see different factors, including trust North Korean reporting total cases. use ‚Äúcomparisons‚Äù Sweden 8 countries well North Korea 8 countries. Again, outside math experience, one effect make look like larger sample size do, setting sample size comparisons.

In short, examples non-lockdown locations super super sketchy.

No discussion find didn‚Äôt compare countries Pre post lockdowns. Sweden North Korea examples places without lockdowns...

Shoddy study. Smoking addiction. chose smoke first 10 stupid kid. hide mines cant quit. Except state, Louisiana, canceled appointments said ‚Äúwe idea we‚Äôre getting more‚Äù Emergency room procedures vaccine roll outs two different things. 4) logistical problems getting people second dose correct time frame. Even small percentage people, still happen. Fear mongering articles pop delay giving virus time mutate overcome vaccine recommend additional restrictions slow spread therefore decrease chance mutations. Capitol building siege, east Washington monument. White House north Washington monument.  new UK guidelines state second dose given within 12 weeks first, rather 3 weeks recommended. vast majority immunity comes first dose though it‚Äôs much beneficial give many people first dose possible wait enough doses available start vaccinating people There's guarantee, still important remember virus still relatively slow terms often mutates. mutate radically short amount time quite unlikely. Honestly, I‚Äôm geneticist, don‚Äôt know. seem many clinical trials/studies based participation mostly white males think diseases/treatments would work differently different populations. Perhaps case vaccinations?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs embarrassing‚Äù: spotty US tracking coronavirus mutations
The US lags behind yet another tool end pandemic: viral genetic quotes vox article interesting info pandemic ‚Äî way back March ‚Äî UK government invested ¬£20 million ($27 million) launch COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium, coordinates collection data public health labs. consortium also tracks viral genetic samples health clinics, university research labs, public health research facilities, help generate close-to-real-time snapshot virus changing allows researchers generate maps like one, shows new, contagious strain virus spread geographically country released underlying data behind B.1.1.7 technical report, allowing us see spread new variant detail pic.twitter.com/eSBQzuaIpi

Scientists able quickly determine answer ‚Äúno.‚Äù (That said, contagious virus still end killing people virulent genomics surveillance doesn‚Äôt allow researchers spot new variants, helps learn crucial lessons virus take advantage fact viruses constantly making copies themselves. every time make copy, may make little typo genetic code. time, mutations meaningless, occur regular rate. makes possible make family tree virus. one viral sample another similar typos, researchers determine closely generate key beginning pandemic, got hands first cases identified Connecticut,‚Äù says Mary Petrone, PhD student works molecular biology lab Yale. Using genomic data, Petrone colleagues able figure whether cases introduced abroad, came somewhere United States. genetic data revealed viruses closely resembled circulating West Coast strains abroad. ‚ÄúIt telling us: actually domestic transmission going on,‚Äù says.

a different article read recently pointed tracking variants also important know many people need vaccinated achieve herd immunity. infectious variant is, larger % needed prevent outbreaks. Man flu real bad year... SMH Totally, paying gym use reservation based, cant get reservation times dont classes. didn‚Äôt fail man. goal posts shift thing. Honestly it‚Äôs fault. they‚Äôre it. Unvaccinated people large majority present powers don‚Äôt want piss letting vaccinated people special treatment (even though special treatment vaccinated absolutely warranted deserved) 99.998% survival rate virus drops life expectancy dramatically? Ya don‚Äôt think Don‚Äôt worry herd immunity then.  locked early hard people eventually got fatigued. first 2 months lockdown strict people followed along. 6+ months many people political backgrounds got tired. It‚Äôs month since restaurants closed. 3 year old daughter daycare (small little pod). I've managed ""only"" get slightly weather twice last year. Verses dozens times previous year. 

In respect, year glorious. Still makes worried 2 times though. Let's say 50% people live 70 50% live 90. Life expectancy therefore 80. 50% live 90 die 80, life expectancy drops 75. Maybe, i've also seen children specifically, like one:  Dunno we‚Äôre 4% total vaxxed, takes week two gain protection need another shot get full immunity. 6-8 week timeline first shot full protection. 65s ~16-17% population, new strain expected dominant March-April soooo...literally right need getting 16-17% vaxxed. size overlap 1b group back line spread new strain determine size possible spike case turn ineffective dangerous. Or, immunity wears several months need booster. Or, Jared hoping hoard sell rich friends profit. help positivity rate total number cases large compared states? No, sorry.

We need 24/7 curfew. Let people buy groceries week go work essential workers.

Otherwise corona never end. Mathematics major here, absolutely mathematically possible. There's law says ""an average cannot change faster 1:1 rate""  I'm confused, mean COVID basically never go away we'll symptoms vaccinations? We're already seeing re-infection possible plus mutations..?? God bless kind stranger! get cold-like symptoms without virus all. Things like sleep deprivation, stress exposure cold weather make feel sick.

The pandemic caused people lot stress missed sleep, easily see anxious people feeling like kinds symptoms. I've seen mentioned lot long-haulers serious symptoms initial infection, I'm sure could explained ICU treatment. found real quick. pre existing conditions, irrationally scared? Bothered entirely unsurprised Stop spreading misinformation. guy died Bhopal Gas Tragedy victim. also died poisoning **9 days after** receiving vaccine, even confirmed whether placebo not.

I never looked checked, private products must fall type warranty, I'm wondering pharmaceutical companies getting free-pass side effects, road, any? Meaning sued due vaccination faulty otherwise.

Telling states isn‚Äôt enough, especially you‚Äôve spent past year blaming everything gone wrong states. Elaborate? safe moderately effective, given, slow current pace COVID spread reduce possibility novel mutations ultimately evade current vaccines. Every new infection another step towards eventuality.

The clock ticking here. don‚Äôt fully understand thought process. Didn‚Äôt vaccine prove effective testing positive disease well reducing onset symptoms? don‚Äôt symptoms result transmission disease? wouldn‚Äôt vaccine effective transmission default? Prepping us lockdowns, mask wearing restrictions despite fact vaccines start working.. fucked LA, even funny. true. Many people died Covid either past life expectancy within years.

The opioid crisis also caused reckless behavior. I've opioids times surgery go ahead buy heroin afterwards, even though pretty easy live. want OD fentanyl die age 20, choice. 

Access healthcare problem, probably big deal voluntarily choices. Doable require 2 things 
Supply coordination.

For coordination part, really need utilize stadiums, large arena, areas people safely enter exit.  viruses mutate, effective ones persist overtake like increased transmissibility. Mutation mean existing vaccines work (I read ""concerns"" Brazil thing, nothing concrete yet; far, good).

I'm worried right now. reckon come about, suggested, *people* decide pandemic's throw caution wind. It‚Äôs chaotic part general population. evades antibodies like prime Muhammad Ali slipping punches  Spanish flu deaths bacterial pneumonia developed viral infection damaged lung tissue.  people follow suit, assuming live California, doomed. Anyone get covering bet would protest lockdowns point. Protest shitty government make distribution happen timely manner understand, would someone think lockdowns longer needed different country vacinated? hiccup, full stop vaccination. 

Except it‚Äôs not. There‚Äôs plenty go around use ‚Äúsecond‚Äù dose they‚Äôre still getting since it‚Äôs identical. That‚Äôs actually strategy recommended anyways. Shipping resume quickly still get shots health dept, systems.

I‚Äôm pretty pleased declined part EU vaccination programme 6 months ago too. risk paid us. stick outside stuff risk considerably lower, especially mask. articles asymptotic people spread it, presymptomatic people appeared asymptomatic later got sick did? Well but... God make wife too? Oh no. Whatever shall do.  so?  South African variant? fascinating me. exactly compare prior years (positivity rate still 30-40% relative prior years, although testing higher extent may expected, although rhinovirus common positivity rates high random population begin with). 

Rhinovirus seem spread commonly via fomites perhaps surprising. chance get via incidental contact surfaces poor hand hygiene. Social distancing masks help much pick hours later common touch surfaces. 

Even then, would still predicted bigger impact rhinovirus spread. Even work home / school home theoretically significantly reduce prevalence virtue less contact people common surfaces. 

I suppose common cold all. reason that. Easily spread nasty little buggers. Deep breath, relax. Second dose timing wide window. fine Yeah, actually makes perfect sense... supposed do, creating 700m new doses happy. I‚Äôm proud county. 17k doses we‚Äôve given we‚Äôve administer 11k 4K reserved second doses. 

Our health department vocal reason they‚Äôre moving tiers slowly state federal government tell many doses they‚Äôll get less week before, number isn‚Äôt always increasing. 


I bet lot counties feel way, bigger county difficult manage supply. federal government needs coordinate manufacturers better figure 3+ week supply rate stick it. Otherwise counties want hoard don‚Äôt administer lose second doses. I‚Äôm going call sister get answer. I‚Äôll back. Got 1st vaccine yesterday, part. Bingo gets jab quicker, doc could close eyes toss me. Sorry reddit, allowed post positive things US Campaign (&amp; primary old school Dems) national health service own. would cheaper, better accessible US now. 

My US family doctor moving consierge, need find new one. basically, even insane insurance ($4000 month husband + me) say offer normal appointments (like NHS) pay extra thousand directly top normal costs, they'll let book appointment. 

So wealthy part US, huge monthly premiums, still can't offer service anywhere near NHS, tenth cost paperwork citizens.

Prioritizing people based bad habits stupid. Exactly. get it. Basically. literally aren‚Äôt worried it. also aren‚Äôt really testing either. Yet cant apply basic logic people dying covid?  never said don‚Äôt exist, probably trolls comment replying specifically said. ttttttttttttrrrRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUEEEEE got first dose last week Michigan teacher second dose coming end month. Can't said many Type II diabetics many obese people?  Seriously...There nothing wrong enjoying fun things people? makes life precious me. many nice, kind good hearted people really hurting able appreciate life together them. Good scientific data worth effort. Remember doctor demon sperm told us hundred percent covid recovery rate?  prefer studies peer reviewed data included. Yes. government employer needs play big role.
1st. Government provides pay isolation (unless employee sick time)
2nd employer guarantee job isolation know CCP locked hard

Are seriously getting it? Don‚Äôt fuck up, Canada! No. possibilities, bot equally probable. people positive test fall category 3. proportion positive tests cases actually depends overall prevalence disease. question voted? 

I guess supposed agree anything negative Biden without asking questions. kill yourself. choice to. think issue is, UK government difficult position.

Europe hit second wave. hindsight locking country back January correct move, realistically without time traveller data serious actually reached western government around Feb/March, point lockdowns implemented late.

With infectious was, got foothold, way actually contain it, turns game mitigation. Yes, year long lockdown would caused least deaths, anyone Neckbeard redditor realistic solution, stopping education industry entire country year go, (As well mental effects people mentally unable lockdown long) meaning entire process trying lockdown best times. virus mutated way did, we'd mostly ok right now.

But means entire thing precarious balancing act shutting everything virus based deaths, made even harder fact every piece data already 2 weeks late. terms actions, think personally anyone would done better.

The real issue communication lack solid definitions ""Essential workers"" ""Can't work home"" mean, definitions far far travel exercise. help government refused punish Dominic cummings ""testing eyesight via driving"" turned lot people following lockdown, police many counties decided go ""full jobsworth"" suggesting they're going start looking people's shopping baskets entire they're buying ""essential"" items, shaming solitary dog walkers using drones.

Basically nobody knows exactly government wants us do, people kinda winging it. positivity rate changes, would choose maximum make calculation? reference ten times amount vaccinated far doesnt fit narrative deal people Type II diabetes? part, overconsumption food sugary drinks choice lead that, prioritized smokers. things microscopic, maybe much deal. sins fathers‚Ä¶ existing relationships care centers. Sky news good one. tells percentage people England, Wales, Scotland Northern Ireland first dose many people left. also tells many second well many 80s it. Lies sun set west? Apparently protests Vienna effective ridiculous convoluted conspiracy. much easier explain good old fashion government incompetence. ever dmv? rate reach heard immunity counted residents Los Angeles. What, hear bro, person school cancelled, forever, everywhere!!!1!1! I'm sitting looked like Europe half arsed whole lockdown thing, essential workers given letter government show got pulled police, otherwise travel allowed even within cities. companies get decide weather essential government told yes open letters essential staff may open staff must stay home. schools closed, pubs bars restaurants closed even takeaway delivery. Supermarkets grocery stores enforced strict limits occupancy continously cleaned sanitised premises equipment. ports entry restricted arrivals isolate home beginning remanded managed isolation certain circumstances, later changed new arrivals must stay managed isolation. first identified genetically sequenced Wuhan, mean virus originated there. like UK variant necessarily originate UK. 

And even originate China, China still owe ounce anyone. job dealing Covid extremely well borders. set laws rest world, thus responsibilities lies solely country's lawmakers. know, close. like US, India want screw efforts.. least coutry making good efforts. country less moronic population yours.You keep whining everything didn‚Äôt downvote, think it‚Äôs safe say disease experts epidemiologists polled probably different standard general public getting back regular activities. opinion seems far conservative individuals, many people disagree them. Yes bikes definately cause problems fix they. big brain time apparently I'll put strong maybe..  six friends family members die 2020. far year life. surprising news me.  Looking stats country, Sweden, close 70% deaths aged 80. like 2% 60.

He said ""the majority"" ""only"", came demagoguery insults. 70% clear majority me. Prison. FTFY.  I've read studies annual flu finding R value (how many people sick person infects) 1.3 average. That's contagious. CDC estimates 2.5 Covid. Hypothetically cut transmission half, flu drops 0.65 dies part Covid remains 1 1.25 spreads grows. Thanks! Honest god reason job got laid last job different industry get evicted lucked it. It‚Äôs great learning experience sure live town guy train wreck. belongs jail. acting like spoiled twat. Interesting read, thanks. never ceases blow mind we've reached point technologically mass produce parts viruses, weakened/inactive ones, mix match. that? Thanks Trump. clear, purely fault grossly incompetent Trump administration preferred make political points grift instead anything actually useful fight pandemic. kids old enough know COVID terrified getting would prefer stay home.

This ring true all. summer surge driven mostly people teens 20s. They're *by far* least terrified getting it, good reason. tools mean successful countries kept control regained control. Contact tracing (which useful cases rare), enforced quarantine testing travellers, testing mild flu-like symptoms ensuring get paid medical leave.
 
I think WHO‚Äôs comments directed governments umm... less effective, rather telling individuals social distance wear masks forever. fucked pangolin didn‚Äôt Shrinks getting fucked virus well. feel bad them.  Even so, average going undermine impact many people died already old. level devastation daily life grinding halt, year feels underwhelming. I‚Äôm arguing it, saying whoever wants vaccine able get it. would probably work better staged stuff got going on. beyond ridiculous shows society lost totally common sense naturality death. think people entitled live forever.

Of course Covid vaccines make people immortal extremely frail people care homes die causes.

It even questionable extent highest priority vaccinating, fact might ""wasting"" vaccine. Perhaps people old enough risk group, life expectancy months getting first. clutch. Thank much. 

This whole thing game changer, already ordered KN95s well KF94s test out, I'm feeling much optimistic now. 

Being able reuse letting sit sounds like winner, usually double mask cloth mask top hopefully helps filtered mask bit reusable. Thank you!

I've looking kind affordable filtered masks available better straight cloth finally found here. Ty ty.  Uhm what? European countries badly hit mean natural herd immunity strategies... I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm NDA stuff like :p wonder much handle seems state governors wrong then? Covid contagious flu. That‚Äôs Covid. CCP trying blame countries? ever dmv? want anything. I'm simply pointing bit inconsistency.  they're locked hotel room 2 weeks

except paltry 5 hours day practice. likely die seems like pretty good reason get vaccinated Vote me. promise corporate whore like everyone else. don‚Äôt want give many details you‚Äôre right ballpark. That's I'm thinking.   Lmaoo Well know 100% certainty Covid cause deaths. stands reason someone diagnosed dies, died it. 

Every single piece evidence available clinical trials vaccines shown safe, mild side effects produced single death. 

So determine vaccine kill someone, point don‚Äôt believe actually can, can‚Äôt make definitive ruling. Good point. problem get solved automatically vaccinating risk people greatly decrease hospitalisations?

Btw, worries much time prepare summer either foresight, think worth it, unable avoid hospitals overwhelmed. something like ebola ever hits we'd fucked. Canadian/American painful read (though I‚Äôm happy Brits, don‚Äôt get wrong). Haven‚Äôt seen elderly parents 16 months (they states waiting vaccinated kids visit). many relatives 70s 80s none vaccinated yet. spouse likely won‚Äôt vaccinated September that‚Äôs everything goes well. Ice cream, Mandrake. CHILDREN‚ÄôS ICE CREAM. Oh, also killed bunch people Norway. masks intended single use, testing shown filtration efficiency drops couple percentage points 38 hours wear. good idea let given mask sit three four days wearings allow virus might surface time degrade since washed. UK test positive die within 28 days, that's recorded COVID death. 

Just strange vaccine die within days vaccine death... Welp Pfizer vaccine killed 23 people Norway. fair, us catching diseases years members Mile High Club! lololol  actually remember 9/11 remember learning later school? 

Also wonder 9-1-1 like emergency number came 9/11, kind weird. 911 used 9/11? think that's going thru mind First Responders who're ""supposed"" taking shot next couple weeks SoCal.

Instead hesitancy unknown long-term side effects, want society's guinea pigs. depends define ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù. we‚Äôll probably back semi normality summer full way late 2021 comes social distancing lower cases deaths stuff definitely change.

Ho hum Article text:

Every adult Britain vaccinated end June, senior Government figures hope, grow increasingly optimistic able accelerate rollout.

The Telegraph reveal Whitehall sources believe target could realistically achieved plan vaccinate four five million people week within months.

A two vaccines pipeline, Moderna Johnson &amp; Johnson, could help Britain speed process vaccinate 54 million adults. source said: ""All over-18s June ‚Äì yes."" added: ""It delivery, delivery, delivery.‚Äù

While senior Government figures privately working target, Department Health ‚Äì said hoped vaccinated ""tens millions"" Britons April ‚Äì reluctant publicly acknowledge deadline.

Separately, chief executive Britain's new ¬£158 million Government vaccine factory Oxfordshire told Telegraph able vaccinate entire nation dangerous new Covid strains within four months opens full end year.

However, ministers growing increasingly concerned hitting Government's public target ‚Äì offer jab 14.9 million Britons February 15 ‚Äì due manufacturing delays Pfizer AstraZeneca.

It comes as:

*  Armed Forces medics spend least two months hospitals across South East help ease pressure frontline staff;
*  Councils accused enforcing tighter lockdown measures Government advice closing children‚Äôs playgrounds beauty spot car parks;
*  one million people aged 80 invited book coronavirus jab Vaccination Centre, NHS accelerates immunisation programme, biggest health service history;
*  Trump administration Washington published fresh claims virus may escaped laboratory Wuhan;

The bold forecasts vaccination delivery middle summer came despite supply issues Pfizer AstraZeneca left officials ""a big supply headache"". 

AstraZeneca understood delayed target delivering two million vaccines week UK end month middle next month. Meanwhile, Pfizer said late last week delaying deliveries UK reconfigure manufacturing sites boost capacity 1.3 billion doses two billion year.

One source said presented ""a real challenge"" hit target set Prime Minister offering jabs 14.9 million vulnerable middle February, adding: ""It remains tight, tight targets. always ambitious, massively ambitious.""

A Department Health spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe recognise 'internal target' referenced. aim offer priority groups 1-4 first jab February 15.

‚ÄúThrough UK vaccines delivery plan making fantastic progress rolling jabs quickly possible vulnerable.‚Äù

Ministers also optimistic new vaccine fight new variants emerged Kent, South Africa Brazil developed quickly.

Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told MPs last week new vaccines fight variants administered little 30-40 days first formally identified.

One Whitehall source said AstraZeneca already looking new variants see vaccine needed tweaked.

A source close Sage committee added: ‚ÄúAstraZeneca working potential vaccine. team Oxford looking it. haven‚Äôt got huge amount data work with, neither we.‚Äù

The source added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs likely second Brazil variant already here, although don‚Äôt detected cases yet. data suggests might affect way antibodies see virus."" AstraZeneca declined comment.

Officials encouraged data Israel shown big fall serious illness mortality over-60s 25 per cent two weeks vaccinating 20 per cent target population.

The hope Government UK, hospitalisations deaths Covid-19 fall sharply early-March, two weeks top four priority groups vaccinated.

One source said: ""The beauty vaccinated vulnerable actually great place rest economy begin open up.

‚ÄúWe still careful ‚Äì still socially distance least go back normal know lockdowns coming.‚Äù

Writing Telegraph, Mark Harper, chairman Coronavirus Recovery Group Tory MPs, calls ""clear roadmap"" lift restrictions March 8. says: ""There cannot excuses there's need wait Easter. need clear roadmap freedoms, economy health prospects fully restored.""

Boris Johnson due review rules governing third national lockdown week. 

The UK pre-ordered 17 million doses Moderna vaccine ‚Äì 10 million planned ‚Äì supplies expected arrive spring. Britain also already struck deal 30 million doses Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, option ordering 22 million more, yet approved regulators.

Dr Matthew Duchars, Vaccines Manufacturing Innovation Centre Oxfordshire, said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll able make 70 million doses within four five month period, enough everyone country, open late year.

‚ÄúNew Covid variants absolutely part thinking. probably need make seasonal vaccine variants may well mutations virus, well vaccines diseases. never know what‚Äôs coming next.‚Äù

Currently construction Harwell Science &amp; Innovation Campus Oxfordshire, VMIC first conceived 2018 originally planned open 2022.

When Covid pandemic struck, Government pumped ¬£131 million not-for-profit company bring project forward year.

Much Pfizer Oxford vaccine doses currently rolled UK made factories Belgium Netherlands.

Mr Johnson hailed ""national effort"" latest data showed 3.5 million people received first dose Covid-19 vaccine UK. tweeted: ""We've given 3.5 million vaccine doses protect Covid-19, 324,000 doses yesterday alone.

""Thank everyone helping fantastic national effort. Help NHS staying home save lives."" That's decide. facts facts, articles like fine. Quote please really arguing elderly worth young? That‚Äôs ridiculous. really vaccinate everyone vaccine supply chain, can't afford cluster infected people anywhere supply chain. Gotta wonder...if don‚Äôt stop transmission what‚Äôs herd immunity talk? Seems like appropriate title would ‚ÄúCan vaccinated people still spread COVID-19? don‚Äôt know‚Äù Right, I'm one people. Give people vaccine first. Like said I'm happy wait. Medicare Medicaid account 3rd US budget barely cover fraction population. fuck could afford it? mean facts, can't report facts like it. Asians poor, people like real problem Asian community. stereotyping causes ton damage non rich Asians. sad article guy linked saying it‚Äôs possible people lasting memory 2.5 years

plus y‚Äôall gonna tell remember lol kinda funny seeing different reaction post by... ""reporterre.net"" compared r/worldnews Pfizer says it. take stop getting ‚ÄúNEW RECORD! xxx amount people tested positive CoVid xx hours‚Äù headlines? Strains variants? Learn science. vaccinated- received one dose.  don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted. Perhaps someone disagrees assessment would like explain? Hey, don‚Äôt tell twice. certainly would nice get consistent government cooperation this. I‚Äôm saying right now, that‚Äôs economic reality.  Vaccines aren't, stage, guaranteed stop transmission... serious illness 90% time. question extremely important next months play out. coronavirus vaccine prevents transmission large degree ‚Äî scientists call ‚Äústerilizing immunity‚Äù ‚Äî received doses live largely normal lives. vaccinated person could visit family, friends, travel world, without guilt.   
However, vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent transmission ‚Äî called ‚Äúeffective immunity‚Äù ‚Äî received still get virus pass others. would mean responsible vaccinated person would still take major precautions, wary spreading disease everyone (or least most) could vaccinated.   
The answer could mean difference months pandemic restrictions economic pain. you‚Äôre health care worker, teacher, 70, answer question matters you. work business relies consumer confidence (like restaurant), answer question matters you. one 100,000 Utahns already received first dose waiting second one, answer matters you.

Would like read terms planning (especially vs states) Yeah one understanding workplaces. also benefits need positive test like test trace support payment. Yeah, already place US, test sequence much still bit radar. I'm Denmark they're paying close attention keeping current lockdown measures strict expect English variant become dominant February. 250 cases found far.

I've watched unfold UK terrifying. yet, mention what's pipeline US, get downvoted. Thankfully managed schedule vaccinations elderly parents US early &amp; mid February, hope they'll fully protected time scary exponential shit hits fan. me, I'm last group vaccinated Denmark, I'm screwed.

Herd immunity India?

The numbers startlingly high across India: Nearly 30% capital city New Delhi‚Äôs 16 million people coronavirus; western city Pune, 50% densely packed neighborhoods. financial center Mumbai‚Äôs slums, nearly 60% show evidence of¬†infection recovery.

These results spate recent serological surveys show levels exposure higher what‚Äôs seen anywhere else world, confirm experts long suspected: India‚Äôs outbreak -- world‚Äôs third largest over¬†3 million confirmed cases¬†-- much bigger official numbers show.

But data also suggests something surprising: Enough people may already developed resistance coronavirus places cause slowdown spread. Herd immunity may achieved Lucky vaccines eh? seeing reports even healthcare settings significant portion weren‚Äôt taking vaccine think worried vaccine adoption rates. think message vaccinated people still follow restrictions potential hurt vaccination rates. Even it‚Äôs irrational give people impression vaccine isn‚Äôt effective. people wonder bother. distribution settled vaccine hesitancy could next big snare.  share source link please?

Its estimated 50 million people worldwide died Spanish flu, definitely higher covid far, killed 2 million.

But estimated one third world's population infected Spanish flu. We'd wait one third world's population infected covid see truly compare. hope dont get point.

It look like Spanish flu deadly based numbers I've seen - much unfortunately. also little hard directly compare different eras different technologies medical treatments. 

[A study published compared increased mortality severe months Spanish flu pandemic NYC peak Covid outbreak NYC. found increase mortality due covid 70% increase due Spanish flu. quite there, study authors consider comparable:

""These findings suggest mortality associated COVID-19 early phase New York City outbreak comparable peak mortality observed 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic."" lockdowns dont really stop trajectory Ebola outbreaks mortality rate high virus burns kills people infect. Two things Austria produced discount:

Hitler current crop idiots. Sooo time turn comes get vaccine im gonna already either caught virus, died it, luckily survived exposure met inert vaccineüëç Ok you‚Äôre welcome continue stay home rest world go back normalcy regardless Yes. bring people around country since really massive outbreak going around country. study janky AF.

They advertised free antibody tests people inducement sign up, meaning got disproportionate number people thought might COVID sign up. wasn‚Äôt random sampling.

Then voodoo math turn 44% seroprevalence 75% infected ...it‚Äôs not? That‚Äôs whole life. like we‚Äôre missing much. Lmao dumbest thing I‚Äôve read day. Congrats. Nope African variant? one makes shit pants already They‚Äôre necessary hospitals get overwhelmed. Scientists also say thought might December easier stay home two weeks (which planning anyway) get tested things never right limited supply, probably. supply nearly limited, probably not. Alrighty, so:

* Liquor stores? Yes no?

* shipping companies? Medical supplies food supplies go somewhere.

* meant go month without garbage collection?

* works facilities keep power, water, Internet, phone lines running? essential?

* military operations overseas supported people home military bases. qualify essential? virus never population density - something wishful thinking midwesterners promulgated Hypothetically speaking. new strain appears resistant vaccine, make new vaccine quickly? MRNA vaccines? made quickly. jump many hoops get approval right? would easier approve like fly vaccines made yearly Dr Fucci.

Unreal   wipe surfaces chlorox, wash sheets/etc Sewage used bit used much been. literally early warning system comes exponential growth, days week huge impacts road. AZ vaccine approved yesterday contagious English variant dominant March. Things going get better bit, worse quickly. Hope I'm wrong, see enough vaccinations happening time prevent another super-crisis. Yeah parties too. TL;DR follow up: don‚Äôt know animal studies monkeys indicate receive Moderna Pfizer vaccine may contagious contagious unvaccinated infected individual Simpler solution locking Yup. Truth truth. well youre right getting internet. 
Problem is, right internets got us balls BIG TIME  OP learned little bit virology class took last year. One biggest advantages mRNA it‚Äôs super cheap easy make laboratory setting easy produce. It‚Äôs also bit safer vaccinations methods particularly ‚Äúlive‚Äù vaccines (where take virus replicated it‚Äôs infectious) already trying phased recommended people weakened immune systems. called local council weeks back said administered NHS. looked NHS website specifically stated call people told turn. I'm guessing various NHS trusts resources allocated government department follows deliver resources disposal.

'Round here, vaccination taking place Sunderland December, whereas County Durham Mother's first dose today 80. 

Either way, I'm pleased opportunity way spreading eventually get people. elderly may shopping would like, still go doctors places necessity; every time go risk increases. Everyone going statistically die. mean offered life would died point anyway... means people get prescribed oxy become addicted it. Without phase 3, would expect people get untested vaccine.

It's efficient wait give safer effective covishield. spread high risk health many doctors health care workers give covaxin, may even sub 50% effective. thought numbers seemed wrong! Thats actually pretty low, considering....

They something right.

Still, variant dont trust it. Novavax fast food Starbucks retail. strictly emergency services (fire, police, medical (human veterinary) grocery. Unsure got downvoted considering would help ton even mentioned everyone working compensated one losing source income.s. theory, that‚Äôs exactly happen, virus affected people equally. However, COVID-19‚Äôs case WAY spreaders people great risk dying. fastest way save lives vaccine risk populations first. Nurses aren‚Äôt 4 weeks. wife covid. returned work today ICU, 10 days positive test. so? would assumed COVID preventive measures place flu would wind They'll learn quick get car crash takes 10+ hours get admitted. find racist rednecks basically pretty much every state go rural areas. um.....FUCK. What‚Äôs US figure? good vaccine tracker? It‚Äôs weeks since New Years since Christmas. spike cases? fact, 7 3 day averages down. Oh redditors backpedal say overstated. Amazing goalposts keep moving. allergies, gotten allergist test since illness? really bad viral infection years ago triggered allergy, I've never one before. kinds symptoms caused resulting swelling irritation sinuses -- shortness breath, mental fog, chest pain (look costochondritis), kinds things.

The solution allergy shots, daily allergy meds, things reduce swelling sinuses. Someone know Covid long-term symptoms like describe relayed info. allergies, found great relief steroidal sinus sprays. thought. mean yeah really can‚Äôt blame people traveling get it. could guess it‚Äôs states‚Äô complete lack work planning distribution. Everyone 65+ least access now; fact don‚Äôt disappointing. confirm. wife Covid. went back work today 10 days since positive test. Made close able get vaccinated tested positive Wednesday. Pretty sick today better yesterday. hot areas probably wait Oxford vaccine practical distribute. Mountain momma I'm Denmark feel much you. hope supply picks think government pretty good distribution. remarkable testing capabilities impressed end. Hopefully vaccination centers stocked opened soon! everyone lucky enough live countries without lockdowns wide ranging, far reaching restrictions. 0.1% US population already died? truth? 400,000 dead Americans still life left live? overrun hospitals? long term effects? truly made essential businesses open.

So *is* ""essential business"" then? never wear makeup, insecurity. Simplest reason enough eggs.

So never really studied happens give someone 20-strain flu shot.  point since couldn‚Äôt get eggs manufacture many strains anyway.

New tech means might worth studying - see increases side effects, check make sure people get broad range immunity covering presented strains (rather random 15/20).

But it‚Äôs likely they‚Äôll try universal flu vaccine instead.  20 parts 1 job? moderna given 16 year olds. we're got everyone vaccinated wants start giving healthy teenagers school. They're vectors certainly even vulnerable group. Getting herd immunity new super covid variant probably percentage points higher. we'll probably hit wall amount people accept vaccine get herd immunity. Vaccinating kids help lower transmission rates then.  think 19-30 year old forever called millenium. People love hate them, hey, least hating us anymore. Rewind last spring, world begging \_any\_ solution, health ministries setting moderately low bar would qualify useful.

And really, good thing many different projects pursued clear would actually work.

We may moving towards time preferably consolidate cut deals multi-site manufacturing promising results (some already happening) - recognize one plan works much right thing do. That‚Äôs appeal emotion, logical argument. It‚Äôs also true.

There lots bad scenarios envisioned come true. early days virus, common sub project multiple millions deaths US alone.  months, many people stated probably impossible create vaccine coronavirus, one would several years away.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs downplaying say ‚Äúwe fucked badly isn‚Äôt much room fuck left places.‚Äù toddler. now, Covid vaccines 16. get vaccine, still need stay home time I'd able bring something home kid? No.  Imagine never getting another flu. Amazing.  parents Pfizer one passed first. Nah, infected fatality rate generally stayed around .5 .7% (many papers cite this). Case fatality rate change lot depending case count. Would one explain life infused millennium kids kids past genetic change ...or modified natural life ensued born millennium. number COVID-19 hospitalizations continues rise North Texas officials Dallas County confirm first case new variant virus, health care professionals raising concerns could soon forced prioritize patients ones likely survive. certain covid vaccine actually works first...geez. Talk cart horse. spouse likely won‚Äôt vaccinated September that‚Äôs everything goes well.

Where get September estimate from? I'm glad agree. taboo say. staters ask CA bad, I'm like ""I can't say""...literally PC. correct answer. Hey feel frustration, take break social media. 

Also, probably don‚Äôt care you‚Äôre mad, that‚Äôs gonna banhammer sure.  can‚Äôt wait see deaths falling reason we‚Äôre completely locked down. Especially dropping weather gets warmer.  say gonna game changer? Sorry well informed

In theory allows targeting features change much strain strain season season - could take lot guesswork flu vaccines try predict strains trending months ahead time start manufacturing vaccine them. mRNA could theory target something far fundamental influenza virus. sorry cant always get spoon fed , yeah im sure comments reddit america going shit lol Meanwhile, U.S. life expectancy drops dramatically.  Yes. big advantage massive country massive population huge pool resources diverted regional needs dictate. Think New York April, medical staff came country help. 

This one big advantages controlling virus, outbreak usually one region. big problem UK USA massive outbreaks everywhere available resources divert. 

It's also pandemic problem. Everyone needs resources difficult get tests PPE start, every country competing it. talking reports activist Rachana Dhingra, they're refuted.
The Hospital interviewed guy interviewed said activist misled interview procedure followed -

 That's true. Asymptomatic long since proven primary driver, vaccines also prevent getting spreading it. picture this, fire, tempe fire spreading handling extinguisher see pile dry wood besides bucket gasoline, now, stop using extinguisher run get bucket gasoline building, maybe wood burns, maybe fire spreads way avoid explosion. don‚Äôt think would take much longer. exponential growth larger numbers happen quickly. Also one million cases tested, untested positive folks could millions. Yeah. Also keep mind eventually flu fuck us even worse COVID pandemic, done past. I‚Äôm sure specifically sorts supply chain issues. batch requires hundreds unique consumables, shortage one throw wrench whole process. mean fucking morons? swear sub wasnt bad last year. remember arguing American didn‚Äôt agree universal healthcare years ago argument wanted see America collapse actually universal healthcare proper leadership opposite would occur quite sad really Extremely clinically vulnerable 65s. They're time 70 overs  long Bezos makes another 100 billion year coronavirus success  google broken? Smh mean country scam calls come from? Yeah dont trust sources honestly. Sad viewpoint india bc indians generally extremely nice ive met, scam callers kinda destroyed view India :/  sane place sub? post hours ago people comments still saying immunity lasts 3 months reinfection common likely first time we've ever implemented technology mass scale. cost new technology facilities production ups price. 

But becomes standard see becoming cheaper time goes on. Type ""vaccine deaths"" Google see reported pretty much everywhere earth. first dose data fair entirely theoretical, case AZ net efficacy post second doses 12 weeks air needs proven via robust data.

I would term 73% efficacy 22+days post first dose sketchy. First, asks us believe giving second dose *decreased* efficacy vaccine (primary endpoint efficacy 62%) second, confidence interval slips 50% 73% number.

 also limitations clinical efficacy trials. use pfizer example starters, primary efficacy endpoint counts symptomatic infections 7 days post dose 2, discards infections may occured earlier (of course cumulative incidence data shows us infections occur first 12 days vaccine even kicked in). 

You start clock time true primary efficacy endpoint counts symptomatic infections 7 days post dose 2, efficacy  starting 14 days post dose one roughly 90% (table 1, 95% figure also ignores asymptomatic infection. ""True efficacy"" lower. 

We assume Pfizer's asymptomatic efficacy lower. far know, data all. remember Moderna took PCRs patients came second dose vaccine data showed prevented asymptomatic disease, much lower rate. I'm even sure CI stayed 50%. 

AZ unable show asymptomatic efficacy primary regimen, even doses. CI -72% 46% efficacy (table page 105, 

It definitely seems difficult vaccines prevent asymptomatic disease -- actually good. want vaccine prevented 90% asymptomatic disease, still rate serious disease. course intramuscular vaccine respiratory infection much limited inducing mucosal immunity unlike Intranasal vaccines. Data we've seen vaccine candidates IM vs Intranasal routes gives us early clues would ideal approach.

Agreed, hope see intranasal vaccine go trial soon. 'very low' bit stretch here, links go detail consider ' like like' efficacy pfizer post first dose 52% example, actually consider immunity high. state general protection delivered via initial prime, boost (which line historical understandings )  also stress data (on AZ least) indicates immunogenicity increases longer dose interval, also line foundational immunology knowledge. Needs proven better sure. agreed.

As said above, believe reason question limited data available first dose AZ vaccine. difficult believe giving second dose decreased efficacy 73% 62%. Could new regimen (waiting 8-12 weeks first dose) increase efficacy rates mRNA vaccines? guess, doubt either UK regulators AZ really believe it. think hope increases 62%, feel need tell people story get take vaccine. dishonest, probably believe ends justify means maybe do. get point getting though, true. I've said thing rimes. **By logic us concerned potential mutations, nobody using sinopharm. J&amp;J announces less 95% efficacy one dose regimen, also logic giving j&amp;j AZ. two mRNA candidates**  also ideal give vaccines one go rather small chunk population daily wild type spread high, perspective reducing selection pressure toward antibody evasion  what's alternative? Mutations cease happen vaccinate, seen- faster natural spread higher likelihood mutation going occur regardless, particularly immunocompromised .  added downside hospitals overwhelmed. Mutations unlikely simply one step jump protection conferred vaccines time soon, run risk reward calculator, accept possibility mutations occuring, accept vaccines could adjusted keep eye reinfection monitoring prolific sequencing

Agreed bothering hopium addicts i‚Äôm going live reality

I thought live Switzerland? wait, US? 

Also Europe literally 150 million people US, much densely packed land mass... valid comparison. Yup. 80 year old grandmother isn‚Äôt eligible yet, county many old people they‚Äôre starting 85+. one thought send doses really old counties. ‚ÄúMore people develop immunity vaccinated infected.‚Äù Makes sense me. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Ive horrible past year im pretty emotionally numb stuff, found wasting vaccines someone likely die couple years bit waste go someone likely live longer underlying conditions could kill infected covid. Vaccination little point, build immunity infections it. Yea long enough people get reinfected already. Sorry man. Wtf thinking.

I hope holding completely responsible death never live down.  know cynic unpopular opinion. hope right optimism companies countries still follow rules faced threat like pandemic. actually believe rich powerful able manipulate vaccine distribution behind scenes, either paying extra hidden threats hear about. You‚Äôre boat me, seem lot numpties don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll that. Wife works NHS she‚Äôll month. Smoking makes look cool though, flu doesn't.

You strange priorities   Here's study interested typical trajectories covid patients lost smell/taste recovered within 7 days, ~95% three weeks (and recoveries continue that). reported infections small fraction all. draw line end, virus probably win this.  vaccine caused it?

Most hospitals capacity since March, many hospitals denied COVID-positive patients entry sent home (which, Japan, counts completely separate death category calculated made official ten years). People dying completely treatable injuries illnesses space left. Someone posted story days ago people dying car accidents ambulances take anywhere get turned away try.

All protect illusion we'll still get host Olympics summer 2021... disgusting. Japan *not* control. media control, everyone *thinks* do. Oh don‚Äôt worry, big fuck coming.. Nice!

I think people explore different viewpoints time time, especially sides call delusional. Yup. liquor stores. It‚Äôs meant exhaustive list you‚Äôre going find issue whatever say whatever. COULD work theory. simply know whether still spread COVID even though vaccinated.  Ok thank taking time answer apologize inability concentrate point. elderly mother infected one friends passed away episode back October reading worrying, wondering threat infected vaccination site worse continuation isolation vaccine covers everything comes along better strategy. excited able get vaccine.

**It's anecdotal now.** Note *some* spoilage expected. There's way we're near 50% vaccines. Note ""thousands nationwide"" ""millions"" vaccinated would seem indicate disastrous problem. issue time vaccinated spreaders, gigantic group people, could vaccinated elderly effectively eliminated deaths hospitalizations.

Not even mention there's guarantee vaccine stops spread. fact spread probably coming spreaders anyways, wear masks. home personal mingling real issue. Phew. moment existential dread thought going come new worse way measuring percentages. would argue access health care time becomes culture. one fears bankrupcy go hospital? course hold visit there. wait, also opportunity infect increasing disease. factors : sick leave. strong protections workers here. time ensures culture whereas sick, call boss let him/ know that. people stop coming sick, also cannot infect others, making instance sick next turn around. know.. borderline political really believe factors cannot underestimated well. course: gathering together crowds course drive infections subsequently deats due virus Yeah, fits 200k-250k range mentioned. schools course. lots people totally getting sick. know anti-vaxxer sites going to. say 13 million total doses, assume mean total first second doses, total first doses?

That might sound stupid sorry parent knows: kids spread disease. Basically every time get sick sniffles. basically main vector. sniffles means crushing cold mom dad! Unless absolutely killed off, hate paying it. I'm counting ever seeing money again. That's good thing sure long protection lasts. get vaccinated every year often, best doses hand. percentages include untested - symptomatic cases. much estimate those? Yes may 40% eligible people vaccinated April old killing people. I‚Äôm hoping stays way ü§ûüèº trying look good randomized control study ivermectin.  read. Everyone medicine yell scream paper randomized controlled trial,"" RCT, said third FLCCC leader, Pierre Kory, MD, critical care physician worked recently Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center Milwaukee (more below). ""We believe RCT. believe we're supposed doctor use expertise vaccine data yet tell us affects transmission, impacts mortality. 

We assume vaccine reduces transmission, know. know vaccine reduces severe disease. logical thing treat likely suffer severe disease infected.

There may well point future case numbers high deaths extremely low. meant general.

Spike protein mutation necessarily = vaccine work / reinfection. Pun intended? :) able latch easier due change spike protein, no? person replied state spike protein presumed. Apparently higher ups think twice number people 50-whatever % protection one dose better half 90-whatever 2 doses short term. think likely hospitalized. like 100 younger people vs. 1000 older people icu suppose? told covid hoax!?!?!? indonesia vaccinating essential work force elderly.

[Indonesia vaccine rollout bucks trend targeting younger point trade-off necessarily elderly vs non-eldery, practical sense much control gets first leads trade-off better someone prioritized getting one getting it.

If go honor system 80% shots end going priority groups, speeds process significantly, that's win. end sooner due things really much sooner nature ran course. luckily extra lives saved. support CCP? Agreed. Also, timeline slower SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, compared 1918 Flu. Covid incubation-illness-recovery unfortunately takes much longer.

That brings another thought: completely know pandemics compare one we're over. condolences.

I lost mother eldest sister 2020.

Because COVID-19, attend funerals either. United States' credit, handling vaccination process FAR better actual pandemic response. number people getting vaccinated per day also steadily increasing.  governor one telling clinics allowed vaccinated

and county one set (utterly confusing) registration site

so yeah, little misguided... I'm also pissed county leaders  liverpool doctor friends mentioned received first dose pfizer going receive 2nd dose 3 weeks, instead going spaced 10-12 weeks. can't imagine recommended 3 weeks except government able blanket statement many people vaccinated thus far (even though second dose).

Anyone insight this? vaccinating elderly people first dying it? wording sound bit confusing. understand it, sounded Norway reporting elderly deaths getting Pfizer vaccine. may well vaccine‚Äôs side effects great elderly handle. Chinese? Pfizer American vaccine, German. Moderna American one. Hardly comparison...CA nearly 40 million people 58 counties. entire state South Dakota 891k West Virginia whopping 1.7 million. gonna promulgate mom!   part federal government completely fucked mislead states. part keep skipping past. part seem get. That's kind point though, without evidence nothing conjecture.

Of course there's likely push elites ""in know"" jump queue, without examples point literally misinformation.

It may seem like something ""everybody knows"" that's huge difference ""this happened"".

""Common sense"" code phrase ""wild ass guess"".

Bring evidence table stop spreading lies.  Everyone criticizes Huntington Beach they're average compared population whereas Santa Ana Anaheim almost 50% total OC cases. Even HB I'd wager lot cases deaths older people. expensive live HB zip codes. hell not? Curious purification nerd here, kinds purification techniques use? Sorry, original comment vaccine would produce ADE, reinfection would. Vaccines tested specifically prevent 
ADE. 

The antibodies vaccine different bodies produce. It‚Äôs intended robust natural infection. person already infected ALSO got vaccine, would imagine much safer scenario.

Your antibodies + science antibodies wreck future C19. wondering same... US we‚Äôve thrown doses away opened one could agree give quickly enough. reason business wants shut reduce capacity, right? Thanks reply helps. cant take credit choice blessed me. far understand, spike protein large enough number epitopes antibodies bind hope change catastrophic. They‚Äôre probably afraid vaccine.

hahahah lol. Yeah. thinking thing. reality even cold places, vacation great places. travel, usually travel places fall winter. yeah, see someone living cold wanting vacation warmer climates. 

&amp;nbsp;

The reality all, though, pandemic there's definitely lot rules restrictions put up. Everyone think that.

btw, people article got covid vacationing (guess flying metal tube sky ton people vacationing taking mask frequently might make prone getting covid).

&amp;nbsp;

The real crux article got covid, can't get negative covid test, thus allowed back plane back country origin. means able go back work also paying accommodations food here. considering Covid hit weeks month, that's lot extra money.

At point, know risk get covid vacationing (and vacation, want precautions time), there's chance get covid allowed plane increasing production capacity. Yeah stress.  supporters Trump flags epidemiological investigations revealed Tianjin produced batch ice cream using raw materials including milk powder imported New Zealand whey powder imported Ukraine. Yeah, anyone going budgeted least 14 days expenses whole group, someone got COVID they'd quarantine while. known going in.

The vaccine could sped process side effects overwhelmed already frail states. common side effects joke.

Yes, Moscow Times propaganda outlet, everybody knows that. claim 300k people vaccinated absurd. true, would mean people vaccinated russian vaccine Argentina evidences sources present ""the numbers rounded"". so, China, Netherlands Portugal also making numbers spot.

Hospitizalations already trending (slowly) Sounds like you‚Äôve got lot wrong two bouts Covid California passed Texas Florida total virus cases/million 28th place country Go bed Dad  exactly coronavirus strains weaken years vaccines treatment virus get brought public? country continual conflict means highly organized. also pretty wealthy could compete early doses. Finally, probably continually updated plans biological weapon attack contingency. Israel also doesn‚Äôt conflict privacy laws many Western countries do. able easily implement phone contact tracing, West could dream people would needed opt in. Typically, there's guarantee. Especially virus much spread happens symptoms appear.

The logic given random mutations, ones make virus less lethal keep hosts running around spreading more. Think Ebola puts bed dead within 48 hours vs walk around common cold. hard say applies virus long incubation - could easily see evolve lengthen incubation period nasty change. Remember uk government convinced kids couldn‚Äôt spread covid realised could shut schools? went back saying kids couldn‚Äôt spread virus schools opened September realising December kids could still spread covid? Oh yeah, wish critical thinking restrictions, like fining people wearing masks outside indoor dining open time. Unfortunately government incompetence many levels common theme throughout this.

Why sharing misinformation?

Mamata expressed doubts Covaxin. WB news find involve Covishield hasn't. Quite states dragged kicking screaming mask mandate whatsoever. think states, upon lower death rates, immediately get rid mandates? worse metric?

We've got plan stick it. USA yolo'ing reserves, effort use alternate means like quarantine masks. amount hatred vitriol healthy. Im sorry parents didnt say ""I love you"" enough deserved that.

Not everyone good parents Im deeply sorry bad ones. fault love you. vaccine trial adults, that‚Äôs kids aren‚Äôt getting it, pretty sure rollout isn‚Äôt discriminating age, it‚Äôs discriminating risk group well, least we're something right Typical American politics. problem, blame side.

Health experts can't mandate anything. stage completely agree pull people street to. 

My comment really see number vaccinations rise. example imagine would give Pfizer vaccine multiple home care seniors city? Right you‚Äôd need multiple nurses leaving time. might better let doses soil use multiple nurses. (Yes ideal situation would use left overs home care people, logistically it‚Äôs simple.)

 
It‚Äôll lot easier when/if J&amp;J AstraZenic vaccines approved. said ""**Once high-risk groups vaccinated**, [this bad Brexiteers were...right??! SSP country disgustingly low. line state pension. He‚Äôs saying 65‚Äôs vaccinated therefore don‚Äôt die bad flu. Take 65‚Äôs away 390k number. 

Granted i‚Äôm paranoid getting young person REALLY don‚Äôt want lose sense taste, could see going for. can‚Äôt guarantee within 12 weeks CDC appearently recommends people already Covid still take vaccine make sense all.

I thought group said to. vaccinated infected *so far*. thought implicit apparently sufficiently clear. Bad luck, carveouts film industry maybe? tried shine light encouraging trends: Hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions positivity rates - percentage people tested virus - declined past seven days.

Hopefully, especially vaccine roll improves, means see continued downward trend following weeks. way article says that, provides direct cite this. embedded links link tags Times India. Again, I'd skeptical. Odd rely ""Times India"" Norwegian news. make laugh I‚Äôm tired. Just... tired. virus also human made

Really?! Think so?! Still wondering?! \*grin\* quite par Scandinavia though mean synthetic foods? Abe Fromann?!? sausage king Chicago??? Well we've done something like 50% over-80s month. Another month half seem unrealistic.

The silver lining incoming administration seems focused helping us get back track. 2008, dogfight get $800B much-needed stimulus.

Any wonder there's much uncertainty everything. 20% Florida's population 65 older (second highest rate country). 80.9% covid-19 fatalities country age group.

They targeting risk dying groups. see subset overall virus, getting corona one way produce immunity, would higher risk instruction produce specific piece virus get body immunity.

The new options mean even less virus ends bodies. Godspeed, UK. Plaque. think national guard, FEMA, massive influx funding help massively. pharmacies online well. Fingers crossed get solid data J&amp;J coming week.... That‚Äôs entirely unknown anecdotal best. ‚Äúlong term‚Äù damage thus far individuals extremely bad cases, vast minority. 1% reinfected.

To fair, point time, would extremely unlikely catch Covid twice even immunity all. like 1% world's population confirmed cases now, chances confirmed case two times really slim matter immunity status looks like.

The good news lot people ""not infected study started"" group became infected 35 weeks compared ""confirmed prior infection"" group, estimate previous infection gives 90% protection reinfection. However, still allows 10% chance reinfection. 5% example, call ""extremely rare"". yeah guarantee cases detected fraction what's there. 60% people asymptomatic. Funny mentioned US left Canada, UK, France, more. Wonder Unless she‚Äôs old frail enough point she‚Äôs bedridden barely move, don‚Äôt worry. That‚Äôs viruses work. can‚Äôt keep going forever. people infect, lower transmission rates future.

The current us average 4000 deaths day, looks unlikely reach 5000. probably individual days reach number India reach herd immunity already judging numbers falling nearly 6 months now? somewhere swab reaching. Tim Patterson, owner Patterson-Forest Grove Funeral Home Crematory, funeral business 30 years first time add extra shifts.

Trump economy, baby! That‚Äôs opinion.


I hate them. won‚Äôt wear end year. totally can. 

I wear necessity. totally trade colds year ability wear mask. guy said would impossible viable vaccine end year (we ended three). long media keep promoting man continues wrong consistently? like weatherman predicting annual number hurricanes...guessing. Gm tech later used remove birth defects. humans map human dna know exactly strands what, effective, increasingly selective superficial. society accepted view good not, humans inevitably become homogenised. type.

Anything want logically challenge? lot talk 'vaccine wars' matter national prestige nation backing candidates unique strategy. China chose old tech often used before, UK chose intermediate tech used often, US chose bleeding edge never used technology main candidate.

When dust settled think clear China talked huge game failed deliver. biotech sector China simply advanced result vaccine came worse three main competitors. talked huge game started offer vaccine outside trials population huge confidence. results really disappointing.

I weigh AZ/Oxford vs Moderns/Pfizer approach say think previously unproven bleeding edge approach probably better two. Unbelievably high efficacy simple manufacture, simple change mutations. 

It's interesting see high tech sectors countries perceived everything eventually landed results reported. Let‚Äôs honest here, it‚Äôs PPE suppliers, basically every single industry foreign labor Msia treated badly.

Has COVID taught nothing? vaccinate yes protect yourself, also protect immunocompromised others who's immune systems function well. think self isolate can't go hospital full vulnerable going get vaccinated covid rather vaccine work. question sinovac, dead covid19 viruses injected body, happen getting PCR-Swab? get positive results?

I mean PCR-Swab test kit detect dna covid-19 viruses, matter viruses still alive dead. That's really interesting hear I've managed book tests next day every time I've tried (4 times) got response within hour every time after. And? initial argument rush vaccinate we've supposedly got control. clearly not. UK decent comparison also island nation conservative government, yet, they're rushing roll vaccines. what's point, then? missed ""m"", assuming referring Heinrich Himmler.

Hopefully they've seen keel die they'll begin trust more. even take majority, everyone 65 vaccinated 3 weeks later we'd point numbers essentially flu like nutjobs want vaccinated. speed vaccine ones want it.  Sure, status already far higher 90% effective vaccine. 200x me, I'm young, lean, health issues whatsoever, eat junk food, sky high vitamin status (60ng/ml), work out, sleep right, everything optimized best possibilities.

- vaccine 78% effective mild cases symptoms (with statistical significance) 

- vaccine 100% effective moderate severe covid cases, according preliminary results (still needs data statistical significance) 

So efficacy seems good, even 50%, already better nothing. closely detection rate track actual infection rate though?  Yes! Joe gotten COVID 19, disease would overwhelmed body immune system could learned fight it, causing strong symptoms lead death. Joe vaccinated, vaccine ""pretends"" COVID 19 (or similar analogue mRNA) also triggers immune system forces learn fight disease, except he's actually sick there's never risk developing symptoms. real virus comes around future, body already knows fight prevents infection altogether.

This mRNA vaccines work, basis almost immunization. going well I'm concerned getting second dose within recommended 4-12 weeks period first. could really problematic pushing people use vaccine way used clinical trials leaving chances mutation loss immunity. I'd rather fewer people get correct two doses rushing everyone get one. mean 80 people immunity. 20 get also level immunity. likely get lighter infection, see symptoms, fight easier, etc..

Theres key distinction there. One protection still get covid19 Rock's family found it.

Great way show care evidence science say ""I dont care headlines read"". read more. Remember people get tested show symptoms, incubation period around week.

If someone tests positive within week getting vaccine, already infected got it. test positive one two weeks getting vaccine, infected vaccine could produce immune response.

If someone high risk, stay home gym Yeah definitely trying underplay NHS, far ahead vaccination also due effective procurement decisions made Tory government. 

Plenty countries great healthcare systems supply chains much worse positions are. 

Also, tories increased real terms NHS funding like ¬£30bn since 2015, even additional COVID funding. last months life 3 days post vaccination could 1% remaining lifespan. mind, death toll higher random chance? already million day. don‚Äôt get 100 million people 100 days something massively fucking wrong.  Looking data state skewed too. Like California 7x population Indiana.

There estimates many 30% population already infected. Probably higher lower areas. ""herd immunity"" getting point slow spread.

What promised: #1

What got: #5

We're far behind adminstration promised us would whole Operation Warp Speed joke. Unless new administration gets ramped extremely fast rate expect it'll end summer start seeing widespread benefits vaccinations. welcome, believe US Moderna supply fine, Pfizer might one week delay European Canadian sites, region (Ontario, Canada) said ok extend gap 40 days supply issues pop up, concerned. It‚Äôs matter legality. 

I think tons actual management companies see buildings like work unsurprisingly super conservative rubs wrong way. 

And there‚Äôs already shortage workers industry they‚Äôd shooting foot. 


all true start realizing save money fire non vaccinators save extra ppe testing still needed large portion staff choose get vaccinated. testing factor this? ""case"" either someone showing doctor hospital, positive test. areas test others, people decide get tested times rather others? Like know lot people got tested traveling holidays.

Don‚Äôt get wrong, I‚Äôm fall hard stop. Yup. think straight want deal administration change. Unveiling may actually slow chaos. even commentary current administration- key officials approval process changing. Easier give ones longer term officially. question know answer vaguely hand summer, gov decided give people discounts eat together indoors, reopen schools, encourage people stop working home roughly around time. Needless say, go well. mom who‚Äôs nurse scheduled get second dose Thursday says may available general public another month two, dad predicts won‚Äôt getting first dose till May June. 

Who‚Äôs prediction think accurate? I'm really glad they're getting there. vaccine roll moving rate fucking molasses Canada right now. Hi. dad recently tested positive, luckily I've staying moms' house since got sick. long wait symptoms go away return home? Lots people open air contagion risk almost nil, physical activity thus boosting immune system. Looks great me. That's super reassuring see, thank sharing. = good money

While true money, experience consultant, far don‚Äôt want Covid patients hospitals. 

Also, nurses work overtime long. money motivation, wouldn‚Äôt last working 7 days week week half. Anyone idea nurse‚Äôs job entails even without pandemic would know that. hype facilities overrun corpses

Mahaloz!!! know specifics, understand workings virii PCR tests, following scenario would also plausible: 

You get contact COVID-19, virus replicates, enough get sick (for whatever reasons, immune system discrete, quite likely *some* cells infected full immune response gets rid virus). catch *another* flu-like virus develop symptoms. get tested Covid-19, PCR thing boom reinfection.

 might also way around: common cold, catch Covid virii get tested positive. immune system never fully challenged covid virii develop immunity. months later catch *more* covid virii time gets you. 

And course immune system could simply overwhelmed, even though recognizes virus. Maybe body need regeneration catch lot virii once. 

In case, sickness symptom immune system fighting infected cells, far know. Immunity always prevent sickness sickness always caused single virus everyone searches for. gods sake, different literally vaccine existence.

Nice, maybe English healthcare ministers could advise Canadian government get damn road show? Yes, comment mentioned turkey Indonesia's information still preliminare results, vaccinating health care works guarantee higher efficacity general public, 100% efficacity severe infections statistical significance yet.

And talking Astrazeneca vaccine, one 70% global efficacity. worries one. 

I talked Sinovac vaccine, following results:

50% global efficacity (with statistical significance) 

78% efficacity cases needs ambulatory care (with statistical significance) 

100% cases needs hospitalization (without statistical significance, since 7 cases control group) 

My point is, efficacy seems OK, could even better 100% moderate/severe cases hypotheses turns true. 

English first language, I'm sure I'm clear here.  think trying say article, anecdotal experiences single doctor, prove anything therefore nothing sensational fearmongering garbage. Oh does?

Let us hope! case, everything already invented though. found application mRNA vaccines, means guaranteed, nothing new truly invented, tested confirmed work. People really appreciate much miracle vaccines worked.

We cannot assume vaccine come quickly next pandemic unless we've already vaccinated type virus before. extremely dangerous choice policy, need control pandemics earlier less reliance massive public compliance long periods time. US citizens already testing negative traveling country doesn‚Äôt travel frequently US bad news.

If returning travelers US mainly US tourists recently tested negative (i.e let‚Äôs say resort island Caribbean like Aruba), prevalence covid someone goes week vacation extremely small.

Thus Bayes theorem, even PCR test high specificity, half nearly positives false positives.

These travelers suffer harm stuck foreign country.

A better way would screen test sick people exposure covid.

Then positive tests would likely true positives. really bracing? they...? I'm calling French variant. you‚Äôre okay give someone that‚Äôs immune compromised? can‚Äôt take vaccine. don‚Äôt know right vaccinated infect others. 

Do really want person? still fuck USA. fucking morons jack shit severe symptoms COVID 19. remains seen confers immunity much less sterilizing immunity. call ""spike"" -- increase, rapid. note Y-axis graph start 0%, makes somewhat misleading (that's classic ""how lie statistics"" maneuver). Even lowest point 1960, nearly 30% young adults *did* live parents.

From I've read, get impression 1950s anomaly US. means seeing graph '60s return normal.

The '50s '60s [unusually low ages first large part people could afford get married right high school. era birth control, ""afford get married"" meant ""afford children""; American social norms usually meant living one's parents. could afford younger ages US booming post-WWII economy disproportionate share world's wealth.  evidence point new strain deadly. However, according Dr. Osterholm‚Äôs podcast, identified causing higher viral load. Whether affects virulence remains seen. Even first sentence shows idea 95% even stands for. Keep going life without understanding it, call people marching streets openly mingling--albeit usually masks on!--last summer, mention beachgoers. imagine happening much safer last year! That's also I'm annoyed leftists authoritarian attitudes towards people storming capital. Yes, things stand awful can't believe happened. However, think encourage government crush dissent. Rioting got 8 hour day, weekends, etc. think people familiar enough history class struggle. replying comment US.  No, there's nothing ""special"" J&amp;J vaccine. There's logical reason believe effective one dose vaccine. fact good evidence believe less effective mRNA vaccines far effective viral vector vaccines. think easily done said.

For example, many countries, long term care homes essentially complete lockdown, yet remain one prominent settings virus spreads. Often, brought people still interact general public, i.e. workers.

If isolated settings still vulnerable, would general aged 65+ population less?

The problem pervasive virus total population, higher risk vulnerable, directly not. everybody going labeled ""prioritized"" group?!

I say one person household gets vaccine, get time. experts still sure someone vaccinated transmit carry virus point passing someone else. reason give everybody stop putting people groups, wait around long time get vaccinated. actually illiterate saying found evidence vaccine prevents transmission / contagion? Literally 0 studies done this. 

You downvote don‚Äôt like answer, like dumbshit are, it‚Äôs truth. would need virology degree for?

Seeing crowd picture unmasked, I'd say lot worst enemy.  plenty products sterilize masks phones using UV light amazon compare seasonal influenza without saying ""it flu"". statement incorrect undercuts argument. Yeah that‚Äôs whole question. put elderly hotels would taking care them? There‚Äôs enough home health aids (who would also quarantined) plans build camps now, quarantine breakers. Seriously. keep fighting argument irrelevant said. OP said covid flu, said covid flu. 

hell, even tried help correct mistake made argument nonsensical talk clear care whether including nonsense. 

relax tribe ignore Ebola, H1n1, etc. Florida even one best states vaccinating. solidly middle pack. Triage happens time. Even plenty room, 90 year olds get ICU survival rate low. NHS response run government. know praise get right know. Thanks insights. understand well, mRNA-vaccines temporary genetic manipulation, yet genetic modification whatsoever occur. still call vaccine, hey... I'm scientist.

May insist question nr 2 ?  Yeah really don‚Äôt think would work. would take care them? multigenerational households due elderly person unable live independently. married couples one half immune issues? You‚Äôre supposed ok spouse going hotel knows long? country handling rollout differently, including differing levels procurement. kicker close stay thirty seconds effective.   poo never become public poo, septic tank. thank God January 20th. üôè call B117 variant, time sick UK media claiming UK sequencing illustrated argument. UK media government running propaganda machine fullest like UK health minister said N501v2 dangerous ban arrival SA deflect B117. think additional numbers might come military law enforcement (probably ""force institutions"" too) - guys seem publish general statistics many members vaccinated. curious concept ""being lucky""... wouldn't. there's far many them. benefit younger older, living together cannot easily separated without providing nursing/care elderly.

all plan would shift mental health consequences young people (generally) good support networks, tech savvy, experience navigating modern word onto elderly would old frail, also isolated loved ones. True, hospitals saved patients recover leave, becomes manageable. whole point lockdowns ease hospital use, use down, restrictions ease. people vaccine, think keeps keepin' on. exactly, borders remain closed population whole can't decide over. plus side, know worked become trumps doctor Scottish leaks around July right? Seems like government actually promising UK.  act triage common procedure western europe..
triage major reason restrictions lockdowns happen chose patients treated die. u advocating it... ~ time place judge people. worst thing issue discounts claim truly serious medical issues vaccine priority. whole group comorbidities 65 going associated smokers minor illnesses, not, say, down's syndrome cystic fibrosis. US Citizen, hope Biden coming office, implementing national guard, FEMA give vaccines, giving states money, communication could also get onto schedule. Makes sense. Thanks explanation.

The idea avoid stigma naming variants letters numbers instead location found . slowest vaccinating! FINE. Nothing see people...move along. think state's timelines underpromising putting goalposts far out, bet going quickly pick speed time goes on. mean they're talking 24/7 drive thru vaccination centers every town US.  slow spread, question much.

The less effective vaccine slowing spread, people need get create herd immunity, still possible. Government inaction led successful (to date) vaccination programme? Stop talking it. Canada also ordered huge amount vaccines however don‚Äôt produce (thanks that, Conservative governments past), mercy countries. would say completely right reason well produced country, also started mass production well approvals started. Generally flu vaccines easy manufacturer: need invent new science US strategic chicken reserve lay eggs case needing massively scale flu vaccine production Luckily, going problem‚Äîonly 9% people UK said get vaccine, one lowest rates world: address question, government unlikely oppress people way, may denied entry flights/cinemas etc. private businesses.  HIV ? possibility could work, tried ? Religious fanatics scary. never use even basic reasoning, mention critical thinking.  ITT: casual racism point? *inserts vaccine without looking* everywhere. Rollout uneven. we‚Äôre getting g there. Saw x-men years ago. Many doses delivered record rates, yes  Absolutely... ""More likely get vaccine virus"" still complete nonsense general statistic

I'm disagreeing fact vaccination positive impact (I mine 8 days ago), kind nonsensical soundbyte Lots kids locked home well, didn‚Äôt exposures adults did. link norwegian equivalent bbc. Basically must like everything covid new. adjusting guidelines doctors take critical roll deciding might sick get vaccine older folk getting them. die, others follow. Lol Don‚Äôt worry, he‚Äôs doomer crumbling faced reality life go back normal he‚Äôll sad shut-in again.

These people actively root worst outcome spread fear. Yeah I'm looking forward elder people medical personnel safe. already lot, even rest society remain careful. Meanwhile Canada.... 140 per min NHS, it‚Äôs closer 210 including everything else he‚Äôs top doctor America arguably trusted public says it‚Äôs doable, contradict him? Manaus herd immunity. 76% infection figure biased due based blood donor samples. There's evidence suggest spike due new variant bipassing antibodies. mitigation efforts due limited health care resources though. Sure, could zero mitigation everyone 60 higher risk quarantined inevitably still spreads plenty higher risk even lower risk end hospital, less likely die it.   that‚Äôs NHS, it‚Äôs actually closer 210 minute FL people lining hours get unused vaccine - governor's ordered given tossed. big to-do regional news stations 35 year old music teacher getting one mother told wait line one ones going toss. Fair play him!  Wait 3 days. logistics alone 1 shot...huge win.  get 2nd dose two weeks plan go restaurants again. mean, open could plenty people were, I'll feel safe go there. I'm also finally going get hair cut, go dentist, stuff I've put pandemic.I'm also planning socialize people also vaccinated since friends already. that's probably going change. Id like travel I'll probably hold think going much fun things slightly normal. Roommate got positive test results shut bedroom door. secret we're exactly good terms, chat w/ earlier week (pre positive diagnosis) needs shut door screams profanities gaming (which 14+ hours day sometimes). he's spite me.

Landlord seems unconcerned, he's asked shut door effective. Landlord non-confrontational overly concerned getting virus himself.

I - hand - asthma reduced lung capacity immunocompromised. developed symptoms yet would like take basic courtesy making attempt prevent spreading us - shutting door. I'm sympathetic fact he's feeling good, much blatant insensitivity.

What do? saying I‚Äôm surprised bc states everyone‚Äôs talking disaster vaccines been.

A covid 3rd world country laughing countries 1st world problem. amusing that. what? Wear masks indefinitely? Doesn‚Äôt seem like acceptable solution. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating. end sight reason supply sucks. Doesn‚Äôt help provinces dragging feet either. know dumbass premiers (Ford) could give two shits public health, forget vaccinated people means reopened economy (the important thing, money)? Christ almighty I‚Äôm fed up. numbers climbing like crazy, we‚Äôre back lockdown, people antsy hell. want over! idea time gone long progressed little. Conservatives really end keeping seeing better future forthcoming generations. Norway, like Sweden, vaccinating people care homes, Scandinavia old people also people incapable independent life. People places often months life left. deaths 75. Minimum 4 weeks restrictions lifting. 2 weeks vaccinate vulnerable, 2 weeks see effect hospitalisations. USA waiting die guess. raid based lie,"" Jones said tweet Saturday. ""Still, state issued warrant arrest - even though 'crime' related warrant, scope warrant, wait third party review confidential information computers."" well I'm sure. I've taken vit years suffer much covid efficacy Pfizer vaccine less 95% ? ask read post mentioned Pfizer tested symptomatic people whereas Oxford/AstraZeneca tested people every week? don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre getting 50 million distributed, said 30 million doses would given end December and. It‚Äôs almost end January we‚Äôre 14 million. warp speed hasn‚Äôt spectacular success. They‚Äôre fucking way behind nothing help states jab pint, could ask for. /s yet switzerland they're still skiing...so sick people  huge quinceneras Here's works:  Yeah. healthy adult nice position vaccine ins, halfway done pandemic unless willing return normal without vaccine (which I'm guessing aren't).  Yeah, takes hour get shot three days exhibit symptoms/test positive. Correction new options mean none virus enters body flu? There's new vaccine every year. He's saying massive restrictions place mitigate auto deaths preventable, arguing *against* restrictions bad comparison.  38% getting vaccinated, old fashioned way. No. ID refuse state people. Also that's bit irresponsible cut line J &amp; J‚Äôs one that‚Äôs going complete game changer.

One shot- you‚Äôre done. ‚Äúcome back 3 weeks second one!‚Äù (Which isn‚Äôt bad means. progress good). I‚Äôm fine tell everyone stand outside air drop syringes full vaccine airplane Every week someone article try come spectacular, absurd theories admit age biggest risk factor comes Covid true. work vaccination center we're far capacity. 5 times rate great, full capacity we'd 20 times rate, would far better. minister deserves criticism gets. Everyone seems think good thing really.

People reviving single shot 2 shot vaccine either inflate figures total inoculations whatever reason.

The problem could cause vaccine resistant strain virus.

If figures many people jabs would much less impressive. resources get vaccine needs stop build supply. It‚Äôs good million doses ready they‚Äôre stuck storage somewhere. imagine military quite used getting supplies places fairly efficiently North Dakota already dropped Maybe saving grace least vaccines going somewhere else needed, rather US hoarding them. call local pharmacy get waiting list. That's good grandfather got 2 hrs dropped age requirement. Yeah dude, one arguing less people vaccinated better. evaluating efficacy country's vaccination rollout, percentage population vaccinated better metric evaluate *the strategies, tactics, policies, procedures* rollout. 

If china vaccinated 67 million people undeniably good thing. much less impressive UK vaccinating 67 million people, would mean vaccinated 100% population vs. china vaccinating 4.7 population. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines predominantly heading care homes round now, Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines going public system (NHS).

Source: BBC published words effect, two relatives work healthcare receiving jab Wednesday (one care home getting Oxford one, cleaner NHS getting Pfizer one).

The logistics storing required temperatures likely dictating goes where. really isnt even good excuse anymore since new ones dont even batteries last 10 years. India handling thing.wonder cases deaths are. seem gone back normal life Biden acquiesce needs states. states meeting goal still demand exceeding supply, can't imagine help out. take you‚Äôre scaring Don‚Äôt guys Indian deliver lunch tiffins workers technically best logistics? never get wrong. I‚Äôll spread hope much would like thanks. Honestly. Whiny babies. read articles March-May, said 12-18 months approval. Fauci specifically said closer 18 months. estimated distribution would extremely quick (a months, rather better part year).

Having vaccines approved astonishing achievement blew away initial estimates. Good thing too, US/EU governments basically betting vaccines rather actually tackling problem. Imagine vaccines failed Pfizer/BioNtech's worked, expected schedule approval mid-2021. We'd going winter protection next winter limited coverage one two companies tried provide whole world.

Make mistake, incompetent approach COVID getting bailed science. strategy slowly breaks year suitable pandemic. better factories factories ready produce PPE, tests, vaccines moment's notice next big pandemic. probably lifetimes. Great. What's catch? missing? Trust always dumb, smart ones managed louder. Yes, Oxford vaccine used. MiL (81) vaccinated yesterday  Xennial (born 83) really micro-generation. technically millennial, full identify grew many things ""Gen x"". remember corded phones nothing digital, computers. Hell, remember using rabbit ears even city. first computer experience commedore 64 kindergarten. remember advent internet dial modems. cell phone almost high school thing smart phone. stuff mid-late millenials take pretty much granted.  dont think anyone claims freedom makes stand smoke detectors. don‚Äôt think understand mean. Let‚Äôs say Russia decides go apeshit Europe. would practically impossible mobilising army would lead massive amount cases would cripple mobilisation leaving Russia somewhat vulnerable. doesn‚Äôt make sense. would anyone care military? agree war pointless never underestimate stupid stupid. Yeah, I'm hoping get jabbed week, intend stay masked actual medical professionals tell public masks necessary longer. Cause I'm couple high risk groups, I'll probably weird guy wears mask flu season well, since flu vaccines 50% effective. Getting old sucks...  virus roll impressive, sure. Mainly minimal government intervention.

Nearly every aspect handling crisis disaster, hence highest death count per capita world.  meanwhile live takes almost two weeks actually get covid test everybody gets negative result statistics stay low Example - happens UK, UAE Israel done vaccinating everyone May, country like France Austria 30% done.

What joke. Austria 30% May. government plans 500,000 (5,6% population) vaccinated end March. best 10% May. rate, Austria lockdown-free 2025, assume 60% need vaccinated. there's two places mind wearing mask post-pandemic, it'd public transit grocery store.

While true masks great hindrance communication, two settings usually places socialize. forced wear mask say coffee shop drinking coffee, that's bit different. really. We‚Äôre going living Covid long time. Don‚Äôt think second we‚Äôre also going quarantining measures place amount time. 

Once enough people vaccinated won‚Äôt matter. vaccines say prevent severe hospitalization, basically render virus bad cold flu. 60-90 percent drop severe Covid means hospitals aren‚Äôt overflowed deaths dropped, thus, gradually going back actually living. So, agreeing nutrition, completely walking back topics (well, real anyway) said?

I'm especially confused could think molec bio taught pre med med curriculums. saying they're taught ""senescence"" like saying taught ""mitosis"" ""apoptosis"". US, 2017 average 90-year-old could expect live 4-5 years. CVS partner WV right bc refused help nursing homes Queen already canceled tea parties 2021. don‚Äôt give fuck. We're gonna get there! Yep. first big outbreak US Kirkland WA care home. Within first weeks killed 25% residents. 

Care home mortality rates covid sky high.

Normally flu kills &lt; 12 people year there. know mean bro, revolution people people life bad... mean think recent political events America. People trying overthrow democracy, institutioanl racism government local law enforcement president even recommending people inject bleach kill covid-19 encouraging folks wear masks...and look UK government...I literally shaking right /s India's total fertility rate 2.2 ""Right chaps,form orderly queue, vaccines ready! &amp; go jolly good!"" Hard say. estimate many infections could‚Äôve wrong, reinfection occurring like said. easier time claiming cause cancer since types decayed isotope them. US one best vaccination rates world. matter much dislike Trump personally change. mention article achieving , part, extending time doses? manufacturer recommended 3 weeks 10-12 weeks. 

People working health service furious. 52% immunity first dose + people working front line healthcare surely increases risk another variant emerging? read nose many ACE2 receptors, corona binds leaving cells starve die.

Maybe nose cells, charge ""universal smell"" ACE2 receptors, smell one stays? really help CDC appearently recommends people already Covid still take vaccine make sense 

My theory even though would help vaccine rollout, making statement officially put would end idea re-infection anything extremely rare, useful misconception public health perspective because: 
 
* People might otherwise go way get infected (there here)

* dumbasses claim sore throat December 2019 ""definitely COVID"" might try evade vaccine well social distancing/masking despite still completely at-risk.

I suppose makes sense, also pretty much lying point insist COVID immunity still open question saw early messaging masks, lying backfire hard long-term. feel way. observations people saying want actually typical anti-vaxxers. know people said they're sure mostly seems fast vaccine developed approved, misunderstanding testing/approval process works.

I'm pretty confident large percentage country vaccinated negative side-effects currently want would change minds

 course unfortunately small percentage hard-line anti-vaxxers well much them. Thankfully many anti-vaxxers UK (ironic anti-vax ""movement"" started here) pose much issue. Seems like cases dropping number states (Indiana, Minny, Wisconsin,West Virginia,Iowa, South Dakota) etc..

I wonder possible effects immunity+vaccination starting seen? post looking for. sure weeks away optimistic not. thought was, positive. hiring extra staff run 24/7?? ghoulish there's scarce resource (the cremation thingies) way increase production keep running full time. make money NEED additional ways keep ahead continuing pile bodies. *Things parts Biden‚Äôs agenda


*Things actually happen similarly


Pick one haha. You‚Äôre clearly new whole politics thing. Maybe happen though control congress.  Exactly. know say without automod removing comment political whatever, current guy focused on...let's say, ""other things"" lately, we're knocking 1 million per day's door anyway. see way rocking rolling administration actually focused it. thought meant general Virus. WV well vaccine, started &lt;65 early. Yeah mom ain‚Äôt getting Pfizer‚Äôs. Fuck lol. Sputnik is. leaked elsewhere. e.g. EU there's reason think would worse EU UK Syria source. UK sequencing EU. Syria I'd suspect done sequencing. Central nervous system Oops looks like people like either Isn‚Äôt 320 million America? need two vaccinations within 2 weeks. 640 million vaccinations required. Sounds like lot days. Uk done nearly 3 million 60 days. guess 1.5 million people..pretty pointless really. need 1 million day America needs 3million day.  Yes no.

There assumption number vaccines entering final trials least one would available end last year / early year. least level planning around logistics distribution. Jan 4th. Try keep current events. There's already one person vaccinated (Coronavac) Covid-19. black nurse. military easiest group people vaccinate. guys already get battery vaccinations general public get, group people dedicated administering them. feel great likelihood getting vaccine greater equal getting infected. 

Doesn't really work like though, vaccines going certain age moment. 0% chance vaccine right chance getting infected. Exactly, go phases week left comes first come first serve.


They need stop sitting get arm wants them. 

Such disaster handling. isn't, stat includes first 14 days initial dose vaccine expected take effect. 


Read this: 


After first 14 days vaccine actually takes effect second dose, efficacy estimated 90% Pfizer vaccine. disowned family sees botched lockdowns shitty track trace system one thing country would done right glad vaccinations. stable ordinary refrigeration temperatures months Meanwhile USA... I‚Äôm American literally nothing well. mean 99% survival rate. Possible long term affects don‚Äôt know yet. know malaria. Ebola. AIDS. Hunger. Lack potable water worse covid. I‚Äôm literally saying bigger fish fry. F get approved planned, that‚Äôs pretty much game. would give US plenty supply end February maintain pace least million per day vaccinated March, probably more.  concentrating doses people likely come contact Covid (health care workers) people likely get severely ill (elderly people immune compromising conditions), Covid hospitalizations small fraction now. mention seasonal effects kicking in.

I fully expect attending sporting events person April. (Technically could wanted drive next state over, guess, mean they‚Äôll open everywhere). might keep masking awhile sure, expect large gatherings back sociopathic thinking. Yikes. actually scheduling second dose correctly? family thats saying got first one can't life get second appointment set advance. folks residents SC got vaccinated GA last week. Many states allow non-residents get vaccinated. I'd call someone ask rather take persons word it. impact vaccine distribution? Wrong. said would distribute them. correct missed EOY projection, end January projection 50 million, 33 million distributed two weeks left. taken Federal control getting people's arms, narrative would 'don't heavy-handed, let states it'. can't win complainers, even successes. I'm sure expected May we'd shots arms year-end, yeah right. Sorru clear WV well rolling vaccine. Lots people living middle nowhere makes harder, easier.

One high vaccinating states Alasaka, get ""middle nowhere"" that. may ""serious"", open wild misinterpretation choice countries blindness relevant variables. wild misinterpretation (""lockdowns help"") mostly I'm seeing - seems like designed study specifically spur kinds faulty interpretations, though choices.

However, statement ""Similar reductions case growth may achievable less restrictive interventions"" reasonable conclusion data.

Korea, also Japan, showed us measures sense ""less restrictive"" yet effective allowing lot businesses open people interact lot more. particular, massive surveillance testing (south Korea) universal mask use + serious, targeted backward contact tracing (Japan). is, focus finding source cluster, rather focus preventing onward infection person. Japan got away without massive surveillance testing first, seems failing winter, maybe got lucky first really need - South Korea best contact tracing world, too.

So, study uses South Korea literally half ""successful"" comparison countries completely ignoring two measures made South Korea successful.

Does actually count ""less restrictive"", though? would, say, Americans feel mandatory government access cell phone location data? Would leave cell phones turned sabotage contact tracing, militant protests breaking state houses attack legislators? protests like requiring masks retail businesses, heaven's sake. Even minimal versions measures available countries, possible US.

Which leads another big deal, totally study's radar: exactly difference ""voluntary"" ""more restrictive""? countries, culture much less selfish others, much caring community. Sweden, ""ask"" people politely stop gathering, _they will_. US, **require** people stop gathering, good half _won't_ despite ""more restrictive"". focusing policies rather behaviors, study's comparisons up-end differences. Sweden course well absolute terms, certainly better countries like US despite supposedly - *eventually*. Initially, tried go natural herd immunity, worked really really badly, changed course asked people isolate.

So yes, ""Similar reductions case growth may achievable less restrictive interventions"" - massive surveillance testing backward contact tracing, countries actually consider things ""less restrictive"" would actually comply measures wearing masks gathering indoors strangers beyond what's necessary. tell contact tracers truth (in US, lots people actively lie deceive contact tracers they've convinced leftist plot). Ehhh. exist softened capacity.

The reason politicians politicize lot people minimally effected restrictions. settled family partner probably aren‚Äôt losing much.

For many wfh people don‚Äôt really mind ‚Äúextra safe.‚Äù people worry it‚Äôs basically selfish mindset forget storage temps well live standard refrigerator. Early data israel seems suggest 50% cut infections 14 days It‚Äôs headline. It‚Äôs literal killing patient therapeutic. medicine would immediately retired market. Sociopathic tbh. unless China military troops patrolling street hard sustained curfew lockdown. Even then, new UK variant, difficult bend curve. London recording positivity rates 20%+ shutdown since Dec. 20th! Well USA also vaccinating 4 times rate infection. go outside. wear mask try remain 6 feet people. someone passes within 6 feet without mask that‚Äôs okay long it‚Äôs brief you‚Äôre stopping chat anything. [And first vaccination already occured immediatly I'm jealous Wonder AZ going press release week maybe already knows about.    mRNA GM lol people can't admit Africans better chose listen science counts.

Westerners can't admit sense superiority egotistical pride downfall. That's simply true. trolls gotta troll guess   Temporarily electrocute people death, mRNA side affect, would accept it?


:) guess take smoking. vaccine program seems going well. What‚Äôs going go wrong? can‚Äôt believe government nailed something üòÇ I'm risking stroke buying fast food 2X week. Sure doesnt stop buying it. people ain‚Äôt got alibi... included üò¢ Nope. recognise enormous achievement sort headlines say people ‚Äúdo want cause we‚Äôll alright soon‚Äù. not, immediate future. yeah much stand comment Yeah. Seems much right decision looks like U.K. going ramp vaccination system big time wouldn‚Äôt surprised see everyone vaccinated summer would one impressive shows NHS history. That‚Äôs certainly something proud Brit Agreed, supply state send pharmacies, kind ridiculous. seem still think they're track, medical personnel done end month phase 1b essential workers elderly. Theyre they're one jab Source? Yeah dude, that's it. affecting Asian-Americans able work home much. mainly affecting working class essential workers + healthcare workers. lot socioeconomics country/who jobs likely come contact infected people help also lot non-white communities due tend live close knit, multigenerational families much white communities... 'Merica. knew would happen need vaccines also increase mutation rates. RNA viruses adapt quickly environment, sort like bacteria mutated become antibiotica resistent. I've heard BBC radio news also using crypt Blackburn cathedral vaccine centre. heard Sahara desert winds also carry important fertilizer rainforest. Big chillin. 4 vaccines dream  phrase like that? 

*Cries 48%* Seriously. easily pharmacies first case rather confident artifact testing process.

Dude, least try research making unsubstantiated claims. case first case reinfection 'confident' artifact.

There least [39, confirmed (genetically sequenced), cases thousands suspected cases. would require competence Oval Office. 

We rotten pumpkin leftover Thanksgiving 4 years ago. Man, Canada could ramp like would clear Christmas 2021. Damn long suspenseful wait. front summary point key

The U.S. track secure 100 million doses Moderna's vaccine end March additional 100 million June. wanna get hopes yet cautiously optimistic point! I‚Äôm sorry failed reality testing. considered seeing psychiatrist? states allowed charge $10k+ pop, could funded lot logistics manufacturing doses.  I'm British lol probably missed asymptomatic carriers. But, virologists &amp; immunologist feel vaccines stop enough replication prevent someone contagious &amp; passing others. degree provide sterilizing immunity still needs researched studied. saying we're vaccinating 1 million people per day? Source? doubt plumber would say that. I‚Äôm actually saying don‚Äôt clue you‚Äôre talking about.  UK experts say yes.  know, folks. user provided evidence support wild claim.

Maybe take hint spread propaganda somewhere else? biggest cause poor people babies can't afford. Malaysia's population doubles every 23 years, math out, next 1000 years, Malaysia's population equal current population earth times 6.8 billion, worry, prepare looming disaster better prepared handle current pandemic, comparison looks like trying solve 2+2. detection rate remained (percent detected vs actual number) probably 30% since detected cases doubled since then. sure that's valid assumption. testing improved disimproved? 

This guy predicted 30% end Generation X-Wing - that‚Äôs new one me. I‚Äôm Xennial, born 1981. I‚Äôve heard us called Old Millennials, Oregon Trail Generation, Generation Catalano, Lucky Ones, Xennials, never heard us called Generation X-Wing. makes sense micro-generation born theatrical releases original Star Wars trilogy Generation X-Wing definitely today‚Äôs TIL me.  comment right also, Japan never really tested many people. performed daily tests ONE time, routinely test 14k-40k/day nationally, country half population US 

It bound spread rapidly even testing anyone country merit contact tracing/quarantine response. problem is. Either lowkey racist hate India, disappointed India pile dead bodies. 
Majority Indian popation still lives smaller towns villages. Even 100% Mumbai Delhi Corona, far truth, still nothing number whole country. 
You look like grade fool extrapolating random numbers couple crowded mega cities entire country. MINIMUM 60% India corona, considering avg mortality rate 1-2%, would impossible hide dead bodies. 

You loser. doesn‚Äôt really explain you‚Äôve said. number infection same, basic math. Besides nobody stopped EU building infrastructure logistics order administer vaccine organise everyone even smoother waiting approval even that. Also what‚Äôs point taking approval process now? It‚Äôs already approved administered doesn‚Äôt make difference took 10 years 10 hours, fact numbers great UK point hopefully we‚Äôll see countries including EU. Nobody saying ""just flu"" affects relatively small subset population far rest specifically 65+ health conditions.

So impose restrictions everyone primarily affects subset make sense. would like screening men breast cancer. happen, rarely, far prevalent women certain demographic, ones screened. comment right also, Japan never really tested many people. performed daily tests ONE time, routinely test 14k-40k/day nationally, country half population US 

It bound spread rapidly even testing anyone country merit contact tracing/quarantine response.   worry intend to. Last 7 years joke would take lot position change. Eh handeling better ""developed"" countries, fiiine. Probably likely die virus. note vaccine given people underlying issues, must risk reward analysis decided continue vaccine.
I mean really think it, authorities companies something bad trying force vaccine would gone safest people good reviews, better image people willing vaccinate support vaccine. I‚Äôve posted I‚Äôd like pose possibility flu deaths low year misdiagnosis.
Someone goes hospital bad flu like symptoms. Protocol right would firstly test Covid. type testing likely used PCR tests. High Cycle PCR tests used, nature fairly high possibility false positive result. Meaning could low concentration SARS-COV2 virus actually making sick influenza. get treated like covid patient, placed ward covid patients.
You hospital ward wrk influenza Covid. know comorbidity high predictor bad outcome contracting covid introducing influenza mix covid one would assume could catastrophic.
This would account low influenza deaths would recorded covid high amount covid deaths. would also account covid infections deaths seem increase flu seasons it‚Äôs understood seasonal virus.

I‚Äôm suggesting foul play I‚Äôm accused spreading conspiracies. I. Suggesting could emergency protocols put place pandemic could something wrong diagnosis treatment, much like found early ventilators used actually causing deaths. Totally agree, marketing BS.

Also wavelengths pretty much tanning bulb..sun bleach upholstery, carpets, linen...also damage eyes skin. get cheap bulbs years.

This new tech, particularly safe practically needed. Yeah, don‚Äôt get wrong, I‚Äôm happy government handling roll-out. They‚Äôve extremely efficient administering limited doses we‚Äôve received. They‚Äôre aiming 100k vaccinations per day, supply makes option. would enough vaccinate entire population less two months. problem is. Either lowkey racist hate India, disappointed India pile dead bodies. 
Majority Indian popation still lives smaller towns villages. Even 100% Mumbai Delhi Corona, far truth, still nothing number whole country. 
You look like grade fool extrapolating random numbers couple crowded mega cities entire country. MINIMUM 60% India corona, considering avg mortality rate 1-2%, would impossible hide dead bodies. 

Dont act like loser. first case reinfection E484K variant SARS-CoV-2 recently reported Brazil (Nonaka et al.). Another recent paper (Kemp et al.) suggests selection pressure SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma might associated emergence viral variants.
Because seeing variants evade immune defenses, new monoclonal antibody therapies possibly new vaccines emerging variants may needed. urgent need widespread uptake comprehensive prevention measures reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. rely vaccination alone. black plaque sounds like really bad dental disease.

Currently 1/3 vaccine used government interested criticizing reporters asking hard questions actually vaccinating people. 10 deaths investigation Germany 600k vaccinated (now we're 1M vaccinations, probably deaths too). far authorities believe deaths directly caused vaccine, they're investigating patients died hours days later. guess vaccine could contributing factor least deaths.

Otherwise ignoring facts like makes Neo Nazi Racist Sexist Paedophile, meaning ethically legally punch death. Thx info. Didnt know !

God bless America. Every year /r/conspiracy ""Covid-19 jab gives aids""

I see something ago vaccine ""having aids it"" 

but needless say vacination aids wholy cow thats nobel peace prize level going stop vaccinating people getting vaccine slow spread. gotten yet theres good chance make vaccine without getting . care anyone says, Sputnik 5 coolest name ever seen speculation coronavirus survive Frozen environments months, freezer. I'm wondering many cases coronavirus break due people purchasing contaminated cartons (the outsides food products) storing freezer months. get package cook dinner, coronavirus thaws infects somebody. 

I'm sure extremely unlikely, safe I've wiping packages bring house putting pantry freezer. cannot however disinfect contents food way. I'm worried items meant cooked, cooking process kill virus particles it. I'm worried goods meant consumed cold raw. Ice cream particular worry, also things like yogurt cheese.

It's little discouraging find Frozen good items contaminated manufacturing plant still test positive make homes. think highlights vulnerabilities least wanted consider. They've received vaccine confers substantial immunity. would wrong claim vaccinated. Yeah congratulate us yet. like everywhere else rushing first dose expense second. Instead 3 week gap suggested jabs moronic government decided make longer, far longer. estimates 2-3 months. 

Don't expect lockdown end spring, won't. hand, would deny information frail elderly? Oxford/AZ one would huge US seeing ordered 300 million doses. honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting vaccine end March April. Hearing Fauci say could weeks away huge news! infection fatality ratio (IFR) represents proportion **deaths among infected individuals** [emphasis mine]. reject though.  Nah hardly. trying get answer right questions. poor Brit bongs. sun used never set empire. social media burgers get trouble. Americans: wait guys vaccine?!?  god didn‚Äôt define it, something made did? saying god made person means god defined word bacteria? Would similar saying Lewis Hamilton‚Äôs father 7 time WDC winner made Lewis?   universities seem planning go back fully normal classes schedules fall semester. Depending vaccinations go studying might still need wear mask class probably normal person classes pretty normal college experience. one ignorant people I‚Äôve ever encountered online.

But virus long term entrenched now, take decades get rid it, that's even possible now. NY one heard saying that, still &lt;50% total vaccines used. Made lol way much. I‚Äôm tired. bet know answering straw man here.

I mean, really spend awful lot time using imaginations narrativize completely wrong science, go god-damned ego death let go wrong narratives.

You think Ivermectin keeps people ventilators? separate study that. Drawing conclusions ""my hypothesis in/correct"" breaks stats entirely millions possible things could happened accounting for. draw conclusions outside original hypothesis actually running 1 good experiment 200,000,000 really crappy ones. Thing p 0.05 happen accident 1 20 times. could probably name 20 outcomes part experiment would find strange thay happened one group other. p = 0.05 odds least one happen completely accident. million weird outcomes, hundreds happen accident. messaging disaster. rollout, separate wheat chaff, not. Nobody making excuses. reality I'm pointing out. waiting others? 

I sure want wait, even would able get ""choice"" limited supply. always case regardless whether pandemic not. death toll %, agree similarities. Brits seem handling vaccine distribution way better.  Well, math, even pace one million doses per day, that‚Äôs 150 million fully vaccinated Christmas 2021, meaning there‚Äôs 110 million who‚Äôs early Christmas gift going back line, give 2022 vaccines - don‚Äôt know USA doesn‚Äôt 


Because leader spent last 3 months bitching whining election rigged lost instead worrying worldwide pandemic Passed 400k friday problem? We're mostly vaccinating Oxford vaccine right now. targeting many sites virus one two... virus change Covid 2 vaccines work. every day change another day treatments.

The fucker binds ACE2 making treatments flood body fake ACE2 lol Obviously I'm going they've got must already done everyone elderly vulnerable lists moving general population. started 2 weeks ago owner go G.A.Y. London offered venue vaccinations needed! I'd love see 85 year old Betty's reaction.  also made Ramones take take take Rock Roll High School gunpoint, pulled gun John Lennon asked master tapes 50s covers album, pulled gun ex-wife Ronnie theatened regular basis... think possible reason UK figure vaccinations higher number mother personally overseen? Happy little envious US. God created guy created definition bacteria. like first-tesrament stuff.  Giving vaccines possibly relief stress Covid unit. nurse giving mine chatty! seemed nurses giving day, hospital site. They're using nightingale hospital Glasgow too, biggest capacity fore giving vaccines. California terrible vaccines. forget wear mask. telling me, everyone‚Äôs it, including myself, running smoking things, damaged lungs prevent us living normal life? Like said, obviously people health problems need vaccine, general need stop negative Eh, think people don‚Äôt right coordination. 

So feeble mind, couple streams get vaccinated. 

1. Pharmacies
2. Employers
3 regular Drs offices
4. Government vaccine sites.

If supply could done pretty quick think. 

We could use guard students training go medical field staff government sites, use flu shot process many employers use, use school nurses take care districts ( 1 Foreach school am)

We could also use medical personnel week 2 depending state. 

We need coordination focus supply. plan wearing mine long time. COVID obviously reason, thinking germs spread day droplets makes want wear one forever. 


But yeah, might new normal, perfectly okay. known handful people died one young, healthy woman major cardiac problems due COVID, would want unintentionally infect anyone run risk able catch even vaccine. I‚Äôm moving England  seems people refuse voluntarily follow rules put place contain virus. sounds like U.K. struggling much worse shape even March. biggest travesty ever seen. vaccination speed increase dramatically next weeks responsible go jail, it‚Äôs criminal  believe  I'm comparing Covid cancer, trying explain people die Covid several pre-existing conditions decade life left. said trouble believing people old lose 11-13 years life remaining them, trying explain lot people elderly ""very sick"" nearly close death's door people think are.  One thing widespread consistent masking lowered viral load overall.

Another testing (and still degree) restricted checked hospitals severe critical cases (unless Tokyo Osaka major city actual testing centers available), numbers mostly reflecting cases only. COVID hotline telling people mild cases simply ""stay home two weeks"" many likely do, do, (can't) get tested, that's less tally.

The third thing scientists suspect actual cases anywhere 10-50 times higher what's reported (several articles English search it), possibly due lot asymptomatic carriers mild cases, compel people take time work (the ultimate sin here) go get tested.

Finally, severe lag reporting, reluctance finalize numbers around ten years official counts, means really know accurate counts are. Even weekly daily counts said various sources anywhere 2-6 months off. look value gift sight üôà Keep way! Good luck going stores anywhere without mask Yep, feeling J&amp;J vaccine 50 below, older folks opt mRNA extra protection. 

Reading tea leaves P1/2 reports, J&amp;J might come little short older age groups. Pure speculation though. Vaccine passports? thought conspiracy theory! confirmed? math means, there‚Äôs possible way vaccinate everyone they‚Äôll need revaccinate starting December. don‚Äôt care there‚Äôs 50 billion vaccines, unless somehow manage clone nurses, there‚Äôs one administer it. feel like federal government dropped ball early time make purchase agreements vaccines?

How countries secured much Canada early on. trial set end March 23rd, earlier hit infection numbers sooner. It‚Äôs highly likely workers rights ruthlessly stripped exchange higher minimum wage companies make losses. I'm interested making excuses antivaxxers.

And truth is, reasons didn‚Äôt want simple. don‚Äôt think 44,000 people large enough sample size don‚Äôt know long term side effects are, any. mean like, LONG TERM, week two weeks. 

And plus vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent getting covid, makes bad? 

I dunno man, still got vaccine I‚Äôm tryna protect family there‚Äôs much can‚Äôt even begin comprehend. I‚Äôm trusting scientists.

I currently qualify, reach immunity birth even take first day can, stuck... Right now, fetus significant risk get COVID - except slightly early delivery.
*I* risk, though, teach, kids going back person soon.

It's quandary.  Anyone else feel like bidens plan 100 million doses 100 days way low, like really close hitting 1 million doses per day now, J&amp;J hasnt approved yet, lot states still vaccinating LTCF Hospital workers like PA example... us every type demographic earth tho. think ramp production. all, still lot nations need vaccine ones pay gone first. Wow really trying hard spin slow rollout positive eh. basically Canada return normalcy? vaccines go bad hoard way americans hoard toilet paper. think fairer compare underlying condition obesity. people debate whether smoking obesity choice, ""preventable"". want test yourself, pay around $100. price reduced months prior. spring autumn/fall cost $200-400.    Sorry, I‚Äôm afraid can‚Äôt understand. hope life expectancy keep dropping slightly one year per annum. get negative numbers pretty quickly, I'm biologist, I'd say pretty clear scenario would pleasant. increae amount predators next, that? main point one step solution cause lot changes extremelybunoredictable longer period time.  Touch√© 2 weeks, problem shift manufacturers.. 

it takes time get shit together even know exactly doing.

&amp;#x200B;

the US 4x bigger UK.

4 weeks train ***hundred thousand*** ""injectors""?

c'mon.... even names yet

or place go far, 80,000 people trained deliver vaccines, NHS boss Sir Simon Stevens says, thousands set join effort. charity St John Ambulance Brigade among helping out. Yeah, sake can't wait see that. hand know, seems fallen far think she'll able get back pre-Covid. want least get social aspect back physical. needs it.  Ok, fuck'em, give people want it.  thats awesome! 

hope get things ramped US detected first London &amp; SE. area UK's main entrance point international air &amp; rail travel. yes, there's suspicion originated outside UK. Well must going Ludacris Speed. many people would immediately die? many would slowly get sick?  want pay bill? idea. ToRiEs gOiNg MeSs vAcCiNaTiOnS That‚Äôs convenient take. lost taste smell coughing every day now.
It even heavy case permanent lung damage crap. stop breeding them. issue let graze huge numbers they‚Äôre destroying ecosystem. billions chicken think 80 billion. Let‚Äôs allow numbers reduced naturally predation. memory correct, they've studying mRNA HIV since 90s.

It one many reasons scientists afraid mRNA... invent 9 months ago. companies starting build modular buildings. It‚Äôs new industry got pregnant December 2019 get normal first pregnancy. son born September still met grandparents. places he's gone pediatrician's office walks around neighborhood. retrospect, I'll probably think interesting got experience massive life event massive historical event, right now, sucks. entirely true. still protected, however immunity begin taper sooner second dose within window.  California. mom died New Years won‚Äôt cremate least month. don‚Äôt see image. Ahh missed myself, good catch.  Granted area anything south Newhall Pass ""Los Angeles"" me. national health service well. Don‚Äôt let Tories claim credit take away you. fine Yeah, least they're here, production probably ramp up/more get approved. 

We'll get it. come much you? Obvious sarcasm seen sarcasm. could say Coronavirus came asteroid moon would told hundred times I'm wrong true. God made girl ü§î Money already social construct, hunger isn't. U.S. also leading covid deaths day country world far. makes sense vaccinating far anyone else. delayed increase production 1.3B doses 2B doses 2021.

The delay 2 weeks believe, still receive amount March would before. I'm hoping maybe Canada see additional 700m doses.

The reason Canada shipments delayed US particular plant manufacturing US. countries receiving vaccinations plan experiencing 2 week (or less) delay. elderly people working healthcare currently.

I'm 29 considered clinically extremely vulnerable mine likely sometime February, probably see much difference. Meanwhile us... curiosity, start watch video, see image posted?  wondering image came from... BC gave vaccine waiting more. Pfizer cut expected deliveries, time found US. virus plague

It's around one year. Give time.

Also choosing economy collective health people always false choice. You‚Äôre right also research without getting paid? make valid point. Exactly.  Pretty much anything starting ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know United States isnt this‚Äú ends word ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù. national health service regularly gives injections carries blood tests meant relatively easy exchange COVID vaccines. Getting vaccines approved quickly national method contacting advance individuals go get vaccinated also helps.  That's turned away. Wrong place. talking vaccine well equipped. 

But still problems. Like nurses plumping toilette flow ect. expected something build pace. 

Still great accomplishment. much sounds great, happening Canada brings set challenges. military leader vax strategy hasn‚Äôt involved existing infrastructure that‚Äôs already place. 

They thousands doctors, pharmacists, infrastructure ready play part (they rollout million flu shots yearly) it‚Äôs incredibly slow painful boil ocean kind process never made statement masks work. point remains, need something better rag faces. Something ACTIVELY pumping fresh air breathing holes, filtered, people issues feeling like smothered causing panic attack flip middle store. work constantly yanking catch breath. 


And sure lot phycological, physical, negate problem. issue head mean control it. Deep seated trauma, getting stuck cave someone trying smother pillow cause fight flight reaction, direct root cause lot problems.... teeth dirty right now. Oh. Doh. course. Scexit sounds cool, unorignal.

Scot-Free, Scot Scoot, Scotch Rocks? Exactly far family Democrats gotten virus. don‚Äôt make big stink it, reality virus doesn‚Äôt care Democrat Republican long human. fairness, we've spent year hounding solution. Covid much fun. good news though. Wait, virus‚Äôs mutate!?!?!?!? would‚Äôve known. NHS not.

The NHS absolutely PACKED chucklefucks directoral level. part NHS runs Vaccine administration however, basically hand-picked top Medical Officers, enormous amount autonomy power budgets/programmes. Whitty, Smith, McBride Atherton answer PM country far needing authority goes, Vallance Ruth May (Chief Science Chief Nursing Officer) also pretty powerful people direct lines contact PM whole UK need it.

Whitty may look like crawled Mordor, he's probably one important people planet right now. Would great could US. 

Maybe nationalized healthcare would help? Huh? Neither vast swathes UK population.

Don't fooled headline, people yet, chance getting time soon vaccine counts, yes. population representation, no. Though hopefully keep records still gonna trot vaccine passports include people travel things? definitely really stupid aspects *how* lockdowns implemented (and mom pop vs huge retailers handled one piece), yeah- it‚Äôs hard take NK data seriously.

And know lockdowns work upper respiratory illnesses, look flu rates last year... would COVID completely different? shit work Ioannidis one favorite scientists among anti-lockdown crowd since beginning get month &amp; year right one. say day.  U.K. US great per capita vaccinations. 

The EU Canada like 3-4x behind really need get act together. 

Yes I‚Äôm surprised anyone Early, soon symptoms, small doses. Google (or see doctor possible). trust reddit one. miracle cure harm good.

The home ""remedy"" scientific basis: Take Vitamin regularly, get sick. takes months body process kind need, get started. Again, trust me, one pretty harmless low doses.  one grateful that. Used get jabs ex marine (uk), felt like playing darts. pups reopening

All credit hardworking labs get paid two weeks due cares act. did. people know it? Sounds plausible. would hoped something little speedier something like certainly within realm possibility.  Malaysia. Recently PPE manufacturers also shut covid outbreak among factory workers. housed crowded dormitories communal bathrooms multi-bunk bedrooms, recipe disaster.

Our government busy grabbing power granting greater emergency powers using powers public‚Äôs benefit rather line pockets. Yo going new Varient like every 2 weeks considering popular UK one SA ones got

Cant freak every time.

Vaccines still effective, unless see real evidence contrary. Better California Newsom. I've lost 3 family members six months. Every one caught COVID weeks dying. 

I know caused become callous corrupted, take somewhere else. I'm going engage it. sane employer going penalize people educated pandemic. We'll know happened year, issues came going commonplace they'll something overcome, unless company wants waste ages chasing unicorn employees. I'm pretty sure lot cases actually [false What‚Äôs astounding well going. 2020 bungled badly government ancient fucks know jag. Every single one. middle aged nurses GPs. Might even Easter. could similarly say ""if arent higher risk category able work home stay away public places. Please let let higher risk/exposure people get first"". 

People suck following rules whole. still significant amount people arent selfish listen logic. What's difficult comprehend? wrong O:-) hunch really, kiddos may endure greatest lifelong impacts pandemic. may well lose older relatives COVID, either direct deaths greater reduced life expectancy shredded lungs; many falling year behind school, cope losing teachers veteran teachers quit field retire early Unless high potential allergic reaction, people idiots. Compliance definitely better lockdown 2, that's good What? females live longer take larger percentage vulnerable population, wouldn‚Äôt expect Covid deaths? saying actually smaller percentage deaths males. complete lack flu goes show insanely contagious Covid is.  Shit. Well keep vit D. Even people antibody response cleared virus - cells need vit become trained infected cells. Low vit plenty cells, impotent America sucks, India paperwork make plans instead starting vaccinations. encourage changing ""lack faith in"" ""lack understanding of."" Faith makes seem like science something believe evidence (e.g. blind faith) instead understanding underlying mechanics. both. negative test less 3 days old people 2 years old.

So guy went private party night kids daycare slip right through.

We know daycares hit hard. Even we're past peak pandemic, we're past still near worst it. loosening restrictions less compliance could turn around quickly. roll vaccines new variant takes hold, need somehow get holdouts mask up. Really, need enforcement restrictions beyond breaking big parties. 

I know places potential fines non-compliance. anyone know they've handing tickets?

If could hunker bit longer double masks, social distancing, etc could thing rearview mirror know it. populated areas extremely isolated makes harder transmit. Also small amount states think relevant. Somewhere like US would hell time 50 states deciding themsleves locking who.  23 people also likely drank water morning. 

Does mean water cause death?

The truth don‚Äôt know deaths result vaccine folks going die regardless. 80 nursing homes. Unfortunately, elderly people die nursing homes every single day. 

It‚Äôs important find out, can‚Äôt jump final conclusion vaccines killed people. find source explicitly states doses identical? FDA link says use 0.3ml each, substances concentrations could different.  old enough remember 9/11? were, heard it, etc.
If not, Millennial.

ppl born 99/98/97 zoomers remember 9/11 lol, that's I'm saying tht sucks mean, matter? majoring CS, actually need know CS get job graduate? Sweet, one less year work. would lot better country look @$$ see burning there. virus control country. Despite availability vaccine, country can't even sustain vaccination rate. Looks like US trained medical staff can't even fill needle stick someone's arm. Pathetic superpower. Oh.  thank fuck then. Link updated. URL right link bad. It‚Äôs Purdue study specific topic. hate one people uses pop culture references serious events, but...

Remember Futurama episode networks use searchlights blind helicopter pilots film resulting crashes? That's America's mainstream media outlets seem function days. sow division hatred turn unrest cause yet another story, creates yet unrest. cycle goes on.

If told years ago I'd glad BBC country's main news provider, I'd thought mad. flawed is, actively *try* make people hate other.  man think building hospital 5 days propaganda filling propaganda, seriously brainwashed need go real world see many people sick dying, especially US. Usually generations defined terms come age/events shape formative years. millennial would someone came age near turn millennium.

The rule thumb I've heard young remember Challenger disaster, young remember 9/11 attacks, Millennial Hahahaha trump dude got hard something?? Calm fucking tits trump politician United states America theres one opinion extremely diverse people grouping us together strange examples proves run dumbfounded ignorance kindly calm dick fuck right off

Oh notice even guess care I'm talking single person cant bring anything worthwhile argument dosen't mean resort childish tantrum ridden arguments. good rest day user13472. Lol cite facts. all.

The US number one international travel destination. understand that‚Äôs fundamentally different position Australia, no?  Sadly true based current vaccination rate. could make things clay! compliments survival yes. probably 2-3 months away career change working toward decade. plans hold indefinitely. even want think much money I'm losing potential retirement.

Title say, 40% hospitalized died. impossible close [literacy/education] gap decades

It impossible get people high-quality education. takes funding, staff, political will.

There many countries around world went mostly illiterate peasants mostly well educated within decades. It‚Äôs values leadership holds. conservative extremely stupid like Trump fairly competent like Romney. goes Liberals, etc. Trump, job. opposite leader doing. Turning people science, embracing conspiracy theories calling shit hoax Democrats beginning. Hence radicalizing base. 

The severity disease nothing ideologies leader holds, it‚Äôs actions leader performs/portrays public. 

On note, countries get luxury wealth infrastructure US had. Yet, nothing dumped drain. tried nothing gave up.


Like, we‚Äôre worse india gods sake look population density India compared US. think else blame poor federal response pandemic? Someone... internet... must true then! Imports likely issue ice cream goes cooking process. whey powder milk protein especially would. look either add ins may workers plant made it. Good! thought US fat usually sign poor due able afford good food lacking education nutrition. days trend seems CEOs try fit ""alpha male"" image.

Also, real reason could hate people know next nothing probably never meet? That‚Äôs solid anti-vaxxer logic right there. 

If someone makes claim, it‚Äôs back up. onus doesn‚Äôt fall everyone else fact check them.  do

All schools closed Denmark, exceptions 

If exam finish education, go, school work teacher tested positive. specific location 2021, must tested true all. effectiveness goes far beyond brings severity down. I‚Äôm never working office again. One thing lot people understand California actually highest REAL poverty rate country. Yes, certain regions ridiculously wealthy, there's also lot poverty. can't look average incomes unadjusted cost living. idea ""asymptomatic"" infections massively oversimplified media, see variation numbers. Infections nearly binary people make seem, asymptomatic requires definition ""true"" infection, really have.

Infections go number different points get exposure

1) Innate immune system dispatches foreign particles problem right epithelial surface nose/throat (no antibodies)

2) Innate immune system dispatches infection within days cells get infected virus spreads bit URT (no antibodies)

3) Innate immune system calls help adaptive immune system days dispatches infection (antibodies)

4) Adaptive immune system fails contain virus initiates state viral sepsis, triggers massive hyperinflammation cytokine storm (lots variation antibody production cases, generally strong antibodies)

A PCR test might pick 1 2, would ""asymptomatic"" infection, really mean? likely asymptomatic superspreaders we're concerned about, that's yet proven. protected COVID future either. ""count""? makes whole conversation around immunity post-infection complicated (and sometimes infuriating, two people page ""counts"" infected). Appreciate capping indoor dining 25% closing bars ""shutting world"" false statement. tested positive today, i‚Äôve taken every precaution could past year trying protect family failed. we‚Äôre going start getting vaccine obesity?

That's stretch. normally cooking process frozen American bias, I'm Argentina know study supposed give 91% effectiveness. high Pfizer's 95%. 

We agree 91% enough (if true course). It‚Äôs even employment. lot things don‚Äôt know development. Children don‚Äôt get primal needs met develop disorders. could see rise personality disorders issues. 

Adults saying kids make trying justify potential damage, it‚Äôs wishful thinking. Also know Canada though testing per capita less half US doing. make competition, Canada probably realistically seeing double number infections, more. vaccinations still far outpacing infections. Hence it‚Äôs misleading talking herd immunity vaccines don‚Äôt prevent infection transmission.  latter true former can‚Äôt happen.  think everyone knows they‚Äôll prevent transmission degree real goal many people die it. That‚Äôs kept quiet otherwise you‚Äôre looking riots outside pharmacies. long see decline infection rate UK? still think media pointing minority cases making look like majority

The major issue messaging (That trace app disaster). read article? doesn‚Äôt say OP saying all. reference change policy (that Biden supported well) vaccines kept reserve they‚Äôll sent states soon received pharmaceutical corporations. FFP2 N95 identical, they're similar. second dose data government dashboard. 'trash metric' metric often misinterpreted people understand definition derivation.

Two posts behind there's Telegraph article saying people +18 UK could vaccinated June would easily detected even limited sequencing.

Hmm, really, you‚Äôre probably estimating little sequencing happening. don‚Äôt think ever really know. 

It‚Äôs also really true cases links U.K., don‚Äôt, also predominantly testing people U.K.

It‚Äôs real shame used way punish U.K. trade. Wait...so people hurt lungs purpose higher risk people asmtha?

YES. strawman seems get posted people every day now. ""They WANT go forever!"" ""Everyone sub LOVES lockdowns!"" call who's actually, seriously saying that, nothing. saved dogs too. agreeing covid causes lung damage majority cases, disagreeing assertion thing truly asymptomatic case? 

I tendency agree seems science supporting. People perhaps notice symptoms still damaged time covid, according research. try differentiate ""more less restrictive NPIs"" can't find define those. morning though would it? would unnecessary cost losing lot human life though. want finish end June adults, seems closer 2M week. ain't perfect though leaving gap 12 weeks 2 gabs advised leave gap 21 days 12 weeks tested could come tumbling effectiveness hold up. orange stains White House. fake tan shit gets everywhere. shower X would spread everywhere. good. bad original post misleading title.

We know CCP lied. know cases way worse test. However, locked hard stop pandemic.

So even 10x people cases Wuhan, LA worse right now. yeah fuck too, lets say vaccine works run out. got left fat smokers, brilliant plan whats really happening West Virginia doses given included second dose first doses people. ready second dose cannot get them. West Virginia screwing currently China POC country. racist. People keep pushing restrictions stay long posible realize impact 

Do people exist outside internet trolls, though?

I'm surrounded lot people take Covid seriously pretty much everyone can't wait get vaccinated return life normal. We're getting much vaccine. post viral syndrome almost dying swine flu 21. lungs looked horrendous like 6 months struggling hard walk normal distances done problem before. Took ages get back working shape. year, x-rays clear again. There‚Äôs guarantee they‚Äôre seeing long term. Even number 10x, LA worse. like protective measures taken. Throwing now, especially people gotten second dose, great way make naught. Ya commented reading article, like chump Im sure clean White House new President moves it. Im seeing purpose article relation sub. Florida areas stable hospitalisations, there's need lockdown areas. there's huge numbers hospitalisations healthcare system swamped, need lockdowns. entire world moment.

So go back original there's really strawman used anyone realises lockdowns necessary stop hospitals collapsing. Moderna making flu HIV mRNA vaccines!

Keep mind mRNA vaccines demonstrated 90+% efficacy rate COVID. Traditional Flu shots \~50% efficacy rate. mRNA vaccine developed (yearly) flu shot, rather crummy old egg-based inactivated flu virus ""Model T"" technology 1940s, we'd getting ""Tesla"" technology 2020s instead. (My hope sort dosing people get fevers/myalgias/fatigue often though!)  


... 


&amp; there's going TWO HIV vaccines development! Wow. new era medicine. going hear cancer vaccines soon. Step 1) see data quite succinctly shows one sub's fav. talking points demonstrably false. Step 2) Double snake around it. 

This ""post truth"" era- infinite human cognitive ability snake around counter information paired w/ modern bonus immediately reinforced likes, upvotes, comments, etc. seriously hope name generation Covid, ""Children Quarn"" great name. Yeah, charge Cali states would certainly look WV doing... posted scare people away getting vaccine? outraged yet another lie government, even practical effect nothing worry about.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* posted elsewhere, WV really good training robust network (I think WVIN) ensure vaccinations properly stored, administered recorded accurately. already nice job probably something knew administer. WV issues many things, vaccination thing well. full vaccination moderna phizer requires 2 doses? Yeah 94% chance catching 6% symptoms greatly reduced. chances getting severely ill vaccination ridiculously low. Totally agree. Kids fine. They‚Äôre resilient. Middle class adults (ie - small business owners) getting absolutely murdered right nobody damn thing right now. plan opening relies people getting vaccine, stupid bellend 1-877 KORONA KIDZ.

That's K-O-R-O-N-A- KIDZ. can‚Äôt wait see data. US buying way doses number people living here? Looks like they're buying 600 million doses. work apartment complexes? Skyscraper residential buildings would disaster. 

Is shared AC going spread enough substantial risk factor? It‚Äôs different challenge US. U.K. higher population density US state (I think DC might higher) - course vaccination easier. lockdowns necessary prevent hospitals collapsing, surely would seen Florida now? They‚Äôve open quite time Same. High five!ü§öüèª

....well see ya later fine, vaccine trials (like Oxford) deliberately included people previously infected trials, Pfizer not, look closely graph volunteers developed symptoms tested positive within days vaccine, given know incubation must actively infected incubating getting first dose, problems vaccine. likely helped reduce symptoms severity people longer incubation periods, data say sure. wonder Pakistan get vaccine, seems like long process Children special needs suffering getting educational needs met Right???? number 1 automatically make country 3rd world something lol Yes absolutely right. Read comment harmony. Nice. Italy estimating symptoms getting much lower numbers, tests literally find case flu. 

Exactly 100% fine day 0 sick day 1, flu trouble. Going around fever often even non-allowed, showing sicks places makes look like biological hazard possibly annoying. That's flu low spread, also, heal faster. 

For COVID asymptomatic 2‚Äì12 days, contagious meanwhile, time asymptomatic spreading, initially symptomatic spreading, positive least 20 days. doubt COVID resisting flu found less. Possibly also flu even vaccinated last year COVID we're getting started live Florida. live United States. live UK lockdown moment healthcare system 2-3 weeks away collapsing hospitalisations continued rate. used go WV Immunization conference Charleston say state knows vaccinations. well trained storage dispensing. great network handle vaccinations state. impressed surprised well getting vaccination e quickly efficiently.  35 considered old age medieval times.

I know joke I'd like share nugget information. Based I‚Äôve seen, it‚Äôs virus fear. We‚Äôve turned nation tyrants bed wetting enablers, hence high lockdown support. *cries American* people make sure understand vaccines work. Statements like kind perpetuate ignorance. person already responded pointed out, vaccine get forms virus. However, also efficacy vaccine range place. that, even vaccine low efficacy preventing disease, still often quite useful lessening severity disease contracted. whole comment isn‚Äôt true. know others said too, it‚Äôs factually correct. problems always existed?? Way minimize issue. kids haven‚Äôt school almost year teachers unions refuse open- teachers won‚Äôt even go back getting vaccine.

I think Americans traveled they'd aware it, like say. Umm didn‚Äôt. lot people benefit lockdowns consider kids born 02 zoomers. clear distinction still school. groups grew smartphones acts different group picking popularity group then.

If possible test entire country today, number covid positive people charts.  link post replied it.

I know what's else say.  sir can't ""flu free"" see flu many variants receive vaccine one variants.

I know else say.  kids taking home families... Yes vaccinate teachers, high risk job families?

I still hope.   many people getting tested flu? many people getting tested Covid? many similar symptoms. showing symptoms, testing Covid pandemic? already significantly worse already.

Right Portugal 10.000 new cases days(population 10 million), ambulances clogging front hospitals...

So definitely worse already... Well shit. jab stop Sounds like it‚Äôs time new doctor. Feel better! falling way short goals.

TL;DR: never trust Indian news. Luckily millions doses Oxford vaccine available. probably wait another four months approve it, might prevent severe disease rather preventing disease entirely. Instead continue leave hundreds millions Americans unvaccinated.  Lets pretend large number people abandoned care take precaution August. effects seen decades USA. Every person gets COVID-19 pre-existing condition. I‚Äôve read lung damage also seen people asymptomatic. top that, USA universal health care. lot Americans suffer long term health problems insurance see doctor regularly. mean, probably #1 lot things.

Just good ones... Ironically, Generation Alpha coming couple generations betas... amazing difficult get kind information, difficult since beginning. 


Makes ya think. someone born today technically counts I'm crying you, Argentina. 

You deserve guinea pigs given BS vaccine. I'm saying is. faith Russian science Argentinean government's decision purchase use vaccine released data. called quarantine centres Chinese media. yeah go ahead trust journalism, totally proven trustworthy. world shut 2 months. 400k people dead. consider small group.

I feel need bigger perspective virus impacted whole world. Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* resume normal life? 

People r/coronavirusuk saying things normal September restrictions, really case? don‚Äôt think take another year tbh Sometimes, still find quite astonishing articles Covid-19 write many words, fail mention important considerations almost every time.

For one would be:

Can Covid sustain wild?

From I've read disease duration minks social behavior, I'd guess not. least dear narrative negligible fomite spread holds up. Correct gets even worse, apparently 100% people vaccinated expected die point vaccination Every 3 minutes covid death. I'm sure that's right. infection rate currently higher vaccine rollout rates basically tied. That‚Äôs threshold cases dropping everyone behaves exactly way virus.

If even people wearing masks distancing, cases begin drop sooner truly great strategy it‚Äôs working. applaud West Virginia. Rather relying national chains, 250 local pharmacists set clinics rural communities. fact residents may wary vaccine seem trust makes difference.

The result? 7.5% population already received it‚Äôs first jab. U.S. state. dominant Syria, leak UK else since Sept (first detected UK). people Syria travel UK else? Usps best logistics world. Really sorry read that. would never downplay suffering anyone who‚Äôs virus whether symptoms mild not. genuinely sounds scary I‚Äôm glas partner recovering. 

I think pressuring people trying scare getting vaccine dangerous route go down. Yes cause definitely anything avery minor contributing factor major negative consequences. See look , New York city shut schools November unique situation close indoor dining anything time. would hard-pressed find shut schools exactly case increase graph change . Wow, yes, thank shedding light this. thinking booking winter trip Japan end year, seem like good idea. looking WorldoMeter, looks like Japan amount testing Mexico, similar populations, everyone knows Mexico barely testing. wonder get mainstream press? think election/coup taken news away important information investigations like this. doesn‚Äôt anything though. It‚Äôs amazing NHS thank this. tried Wellbutrin depression really fucks up. Five-hour panic attack, shortness breath, uncontrollable sobbing, thoughts death, etc. better going cold turkey reducing nicotine intake time. real reason Covid spreads. aren‚Äôt willing subsidize working poor stay home, work, bring home families.

Getting us argue whether it‚Äôs ok go playground whatever distract us noticing that. Averageredditor.exe encountered error. places do. NYC 24/7 vaccine hubs. thought workers Europe paid sick leave. offical sub user Shitting, guy talking Oxford vaccine lol answer - also many South-East Asian countries suffered badly - always obvious me. COVID spread well outdoors, especially hot weather. COVID spreads much faster countries people separate households meet indoors little fresh air. obvious reasons colder countries people spend time indoors. It‚Äôs frustrating see nobody realises think rate deaths USA normal atm? Thufiiiiiiiiiiiiir mean?  don‚Äôt like putting chemicals water, turns fricken frogs gay! 91 million study make sense, though. Take North Dakota hit hard. 7.1x number cases actually caught surge period only, maximum positivity rate (unique individual) had, population state would need 3.1 million. population 762k.  Hahaha hear? Madagascar closed borders! **always** it! typical huh? 

(I know different game, overused 'jokes' still basically same.) know got downvoted, that's literally what's happening. add fumigation list think USA use technology use sporting events theme parks tbh post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thanks! USA see government injecting chips us spy porn habits memes dankest. sequencing poor enough data dominant. e.g. UK migrants arriving Syria. doubt ""people smugglers"" paying attention covid19 testing customers. Even worst case data showed 60% effective preventing infection 100% effective preventing hospitalisation. 

It's also worth noting Oxford trails also testing asymptomatic infections, something wasn‚Äôt done either Pfizer/BionTech Moderna trials. goes obese people. get preferential treatment? 

Further, people took *are currently taking* lockdown, stay home orders, seriously get preferential treatment?

Why person staying indoors, going shop seen extended family 10 months wait long person socializing entire time?

Obviously second example hard qualify, irks me. big one education, I'm close several heads/depu6heads agree government seems adopted strategy 'announce now, plan later', announce policy absolutely consultantation anyone profession, hours/days later walk back everyone gets point literally impossible implement-like decided every single reception kid go back, socially distanced, without thinking maybe schools physically cannot accommodate Pfizer study, claiming 52%, zero effect first 12 study done look efficiency first doses, calculated 90% Pfizer removing 12 days nothing seems happen, 70% AstraZeneca

In addition, here's nice BBC rundown feel like running though chunky scientific studies. (Not looked every single study mentioned there, BBC, they're generally good Thanks advice champ buy shoes. smoker before? not, i'm done talking people know bad nicotine addiction be.

You think guy lung cancer still smoking outside hospital man up? think hes still making excuses care life life family? fucked think. Agoraphobia likely. know seems like bidens already changing direction backpeddling won. also forget every single person needs vaccinated order transmission slowdown/stop
So life might start returning normal even get jab. I‚Äôm careful don‚Äôt really go anywhere anymore. can‚Äôt wait till things get better. I‚Äôm starting feel super depressed.  Actually compliance high UK silver ions chemically? I'm chemist.  Yes Mate here.

If front line worker 85 get til Feb. 65 people 16 65 underlying health conditions make susceptible covid. I'm likely going get July. Right?! thinking thing. There‚Äôs difference making uninformed statement asking question educate yourself. Also thanks mentioning this! probably doubled now. winter wave big spring summer waves combined   Nice. Wish could pick pace US though still posting misinformation daily discussion threads? stop? reckon everyone least first dose August 2021. ambitious I'm optimistic.

The vaccination centres popped night, impressive combined wise investment doses knocking quickly. would one prove vaccine safe microchip meant track kill elderly? got elderly folks family believe vaccine meant track kill old people. got information friends Facebook. mean definition answers question  federal leadership gave shit virus ever. days expect plan... may bets plan gotta better plan. Canada's issue delivery logistics all. 

It's fumbled buying vaccine's without delivery dates guaranteed, domestic production. trickle coming in, trickle got halved next 4-6 weeks. USA UK done vast majority population single person 65 health care work gets shot here.  Yup. Trump kind guy licks spoons drawer show bastids. observation too, old (silent Gen ) much that, lot states literally can't get hands vaccines give local medical practices. PCP (GP) emailed saying bother call any, they'd able give easily did.  president prioritise serving ego? say can't wait return normality.

 


At rate Biden get away second worst president modern times still fantastic job compared Trump. sure trump putting sad balls everything. Conservstives economy. could get away without giving would. mean look fight get kids fed. 

But yeah, one win column them. Shame losses outnumber wins tenfold. Nah. It'll take everything relatively fine. Real life update fast Flu absolutely long-lasting impacts. lots viruses.

Professional hockey player Patrick Eaves career ended years ago mysterious random flu gave severe long-haul issues didn‚Äôt originally say ‚Äúmight‚Äù mouth breather. drive WV get vaccine?  Yeah,

Trump started privitized health care.

Trump started military industrial complex.

Trump started profit education sector.

Trump gutted wonderful socialist policies states place social supports.

Trump made police racist.

Yep, USA GREAT TRUMP! LOL Charcoal, expensive kitchen item replacement, expensive kitchen house replacement, medical bills expensive devastating, death. One those.

Maybe backup case don‚Äôt smell burning food? Like loud timekeeping alert set turn oven stove? saw news media, apparently WV sticking anyone shows wants it. extremely focused getting down, whereas states trying prioritize gets first. problem Trump federal government lied reserve vaccines, people West Virginia may end scrambling get second dose recommended amount time. shit show here. Here's thing. virus altering bodies cellular level causing people die millions lot survivors - leaving long term sometimes permanent effects causing suffer. 

Meanwhile, vaccine (with risk side effects - like vaccine), allows bodies recognize virus launch coordinated immune response, thus reducing severity virus' effects.  


Given choice, I'd rather vaccine. higher chance severe effects covid vaccine. end day, important consider choice science mind knowledge consequences come choices. Amazon best logistics world, makes sense. probably expensive, still lot cheaper developing infrastructure yourself. Ok, looking data, think right, hit 632k first doses given January 15, means kept amount 100 days, would 63 million vaccinated. Depends interests. Chasing scream addiction war drugs. Lost connections depression mental health. appearances JRE also good condensed versions. Real helpful. Actual leadership! novel concept past four years. optimistic pandemic killed ~150 times many people 9/11 Arizona vaccinating half number people number cases coming every day. Nah ones deliver alcohol interested in.

St. Bernards ftw also people think things going completely normal open everything March. entertain either side? No. Oh sorry, America Bad bros! I'm aware. metaphor. followed instead stopping him... likely would drugs bust hands I‚Äôd like read books. I‚Äôve never heard Hari. one would suggest start with? confirm. Wastewater plant work using uv bulbs since I've least 7-8 years. fecal counts going stream pretty consistently &lt;10 colonies /100mL dangerous gas leak without CO build up. similar schemes across Europe, nothing wrong furlough call 'world leading' overstating bit UK one hardest hit countries came say same.  too. lot vaccines aren‚Äôt getting used poor allocation seems like don‚Äôt know properly something scale resources have. 

It‚Äôs hot mess. Currently UK testing 600,000 per day. Government set testing target last spring 100,000 per day counted tests posted part figures claim hit target. America Bad /s Canada prolonging lockdown months..... country first initiate lockdown scenarios.... point we're long haul done tossing coin know.  believe ‚Äúegg sucking cows.‚Äù want briefer Monday, Wednesday, Friday spends fifteen minutes yelling media bashes teachers, talks fishing hunting. 

I‚Äôm tired him. take long turn ""hunkered down"" you. think able find old self again? Give parties hugging random strangers excitement leaving shit behind soon again! So, 6.5 years get whole population. ...troll

Back December, 2000+ people day died due corona.

So rates deaths arent normal. Omg wow, get paid avoid job!! Exactly, like Malaria, Aids, Ebola on, covid likely joke 60ish% needed vaccinated. say 40/70m people need double dose.

3.8m vaccinated, 3 month lag. hit 2m week (doing 1.3m already centres open) Approx 20ish weeks? would early June 2021 1st dose. point Approx 20M people would 2nd dose

12 week lag would end August 2022 40M people 95% efficacy.

Risk - 12 week gap (vs 3 week) doesn‚Äôt work.... What's going Astrazeneca? one seems talking one, bought large supplies it! Right? Yeah, definitely uneven. states exceptional, others absolutely terrible. NY state closer middle, could definitely better mess CA is. Probably sometime 2022 poor countries complete vaccinations Yeah I've critical effort far (he says cautiously) looking better now. Logistics. experience transporting vast amounts material place hospitals wont.

Manpower well, many doctors nurses etc. recruit army medics etc. well, 1,000's vaccinate.  Sorry dumped tea harbour cannot forgiven. Fish Chips! /s much reduced carbon footprint lockdown Probably long time first world countries vaccinated. Maybe 2023, remember lot people live 3rd world countries, virus still ton 3rd world countries, still going considered pandemic. Got shot yesterday right bay area CA  That's way Redditors accept good news England, that's right. seem sorry shit past 6 months. banked vaccine coming wouldn‚Äôt shut things again, including resort. also changed COVID map many times longer represents anything close reality. one, he'd bit preoccupied moment ..

So, again, single step solution dangerous Ok   parts US de facto back normal since summer case numbers past months indication. first known case first case rather confident artifact testing process. uninformed, British Government generally messed lot pandemic. vaccine rollout thankfully one them. annoyed when, autumn, everyone saying flu season going exacerbate pandemic putting excess pressure health systems. Seemed obvious never going flu season COVID measures Never Paywall  know people Marfan higher risk bad outcomes covid? bf (but thankfully doesn‚Äôt heart issues) haven‚Äôt able find much conclusive info, though seems logical marfs could worse time it. blame trudeau one?  Hope people take it? Taking requirement keeping job nursing home. current vaccination plan see would need cancelled. vulnerable population Japan shoukd safe small utbreaks horrible outcomes.

You could test athletes every day (they soccer), require spectators rapid test site, limit number spectators indoor events require athletes quarantine return home.

Of course would safer cancel think July people fed restrictions give crap minor risk. thats case, prioritizing obese? Trump said gonna that. lost though. health secretary flat refused promise we‚Äôll able give people second dose time that... Chad move hosts chances. people say ""I fear covid, people survive"" take account one surviving people might host random mutation ends worse current strains. longer goes likely thing mutates something worse. Nuke orbit, way sure. Ozone cleansing Oh yeah, lot that! Okay? addressing said. made sound people exist. Corona, covid mostly measures it, already difficult people. Please, know mean well, but... saying ""you understand"", basically counterproductive. Though, get easy-to-understand matter. take personal, actually defines results complete mRNA-antivax mentality.

For record, I've never antivaxer. I'm vaxed kids are. covid mRNA-inoculation another matter. I'm hard time understand why. people 65 vaccinated, would kids injected mRNA? apples, oranges dogs, people. Really feel like throwing everything effort nice. Largely looks like goverment's targets mid feb everyone 80 met.  ever get mainstream press, reason stories people dying turned away hospitals seem appear Japanese, one-liner article something. suppose Americans comes kind conspiracy theory-ish, Japan tightly controlled state run media. Anyone going status quo positive image Japan top things quickly finds lose job. many articles English, least, well State Secrets Act prevents reporting things could ""weaken damage nation"" things affect economy and/or population large. mention, little foreign press right since country essentially borders closed since April.

By winter, knows. long vaccinated, may problem. vaccine acceptance one lowest rates world first world country, still probably risk catching it. administration catching shit over-promising outset, saying 50 million doses distributed end January, now, 33 million distributed. they'll probably come damn close number. I'm fan administration happy change coming Wednesday, countless failures part, Operation Warp Speed one them. would COVID declared pandemic anymore? State's busy overregulating school reopenings instead focusing one thing would get reopen fastest! Democrats finest . . . Literally military logistics, best world it. know get supplies US remote places world. real world hard numbers matter percentages. much easier vaccinate higher percentage people populations comparably much lower due vaccine availability. feel like many states overly cautious regard really slowing rollout. 

At end day, public health better served vaccines given *somebody* rather hoarded freezers waiting however long highly specific sets people come get it. becomes bureaucratic mess, point out; however, again, *are* vulnerable people need others. think there‚Äôs fine line prioritizing people risk simply giving anyone asks, think people would abide honor system given chance, turning blind eye there, long run, doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone, either. amount underperformance unacceptable populace.

The goal reasonable, achievable setbacks, yet aspirational. matter many people vaccinated, fast enough. 

100 million short 1/3 country. big enough number like count it.

I would gone 101 million 101 days, like 136 136 days. Indian surprised see people actually defending covaxin comments. approved emergency use without phase 3 data yet government give people option choose covishield covaxin. That's fucking ridiculous defense that.  think country labelling detrimental.

Chinese virus? UK virus? Brazil virus? 

It makes countries future less wary report end getting flak blame.

Pandemics ever politicised UK Military joined NHS led effort forming cross functional teams. Canada good NHS counterpart leading effort? America similar rate quite high fairly high. Countries like israel, uae Bahrain lead. Europe lagging long way behind CONGRATULATIONS UK. God country FUCKING SUCKS.

How would work? testing negative could virus mutating them? key age group said unlikely die take significant amount capacity hospital might hence people age range wouldn‚Äôt need vaccinated later on. 

Makes sense vaccinate elderly first key workers interact public often help stem infection death rate. never said cannot control airports- you‚Äôre attempting debunk point never made.

My point, again, simply, US markedly different situation start pandemic well. plant, no. We‚Äôre currently trying get eligibility state frontline healthcare workers get bumped front line nothing gone far. experts attribute decline US life expectancy prior coronavirus number issues. incredibly shitty US healthcare system, one. believe number people can't afford medical care medicine die earlier result that.

There also experts call ""deaths despair"", caused lack hope future, ties fact median income stayed years although inflation gone up, people working hours less pay, unable get job college still pay huge amounts student loans, etc. etc. Deaths despair take form suicides, heavy drug use, etc. Number deaths despair per year US estimated can't jump conclusions COVID killed tested positive 28 days earlier? really bad H1N1 case teen left weak kidney kidney condition, doctors telling fair lower life expectancy surgery (I swelled hard throat could barely breath. Canadian doctors kept telling drink water. even bother prescribing anything least lessen symptom inflammation. may least avoided surgery... That's free health care ya...

Sorry, don‚Äôt remember think mean opposite? accentuated balanced. percentage broken gender covid deaths. i.e., 46.1% covid deaths female, 41.6% females die covid. words, u/PositivityOnly15 point makes sense women alive increased (aka balanced) covid mortality rate men.  
 
Think way: 

 
What took **500 men 500 women** (even split). 53.9% deaths men, could mean 53 men died 46 woman died. would **10.6% men**, **9% women** dying covid. would reflect known fact covid inherently dangerous men.      

 took **400 men, 600 women** (showing higher population women, albeit exaggerated). 53 men died 46 women died, % would change **13.3% men** (% went up), **7.6% women** (% went down).  women died offset mortality rate men, since women catch covid, right? added 100 women, 9% mortality rate, another 9 women. also decreased percentage men, 10.6% mortality rate men, shaved 2 men, leaving final death count 51 men, 55 women. 
 
So population women increases, total death count gender also increased women. means death rate even worse men statistic shows.  Pretty sure hospitalization rates plateaued awhile back. course total cases increase, can't magically become lower. would rise like 10 years would stop eating literally fat sugar.

They're simply immune. love this! far, we've downplayed potentially bad scenarios. reality hits much differently say ""The U.S. fucked again. taken xxx seriously.""

However case HIV (like case covid) intentionally giving anyone disease, waiting statistically significant difference otherwise randomly selected populations. People catch HIV own. health political now. Instead fatness celebrated. long think Canada guys start seeing effects vaccine death rate etc.

Even FIVE approved vaccines around world, we're looking years distribution likely 6-9 months US.

Prior Amazon business would order X items would stored warehouse city waiting somebody buy it. costs money heat/cool/guard/store items.

So store close perfect amount regional warehouse deliver proper city's warehouse/distribution center needed.

Even items low demand benefit model, need delivery one Amazon hubs day's worth items Amazon takes care rest. Luckily last wave pandemic. Hold tight folks get vaccine soon eligible!

Not massive logistical errors, supply chain bottlenecks, brain freezes leadership (for example, state started expand access couple days ago breath like ""oh shit, signup system""--you maybe could thought months ago?).

US - 11.1 Million vaccines 328 million people (3.38%). Testing numbers 280 Million 23.4 million positive tests (8.35% tests positive)

But otherwise, also concerned giving parent grandparent. virus doesn‚Äôt care killing people. fact, doesn‚Äôt care anything all. there. ‚Äúcares‚Äù replicating didn‚Äôt would exist. think efficacy rating criteria standardized, whether measuring much prevents severe cases cases all.

Generally countries sharing research due capitalism nationalism.

They're researched thousands human subjects get side effects one thousand shot. no-brainer unless absolutely sure catch COVID already. Death rate almost zero, imagine, much mass purchase

Mass production AstraZenica vaccine. Commonwealth Serum Laboratory making it. Downvoting me. Denial. Classic. I'm guessing part body positivity movement? act like think fat healthy. Grandma suppose essential things?

IDK, way everyone else essential things? so? Someone comes get COVID vaccine can‚Äôt even verify date birth, don‚Äôt enough info injecting them. can't make vaccine cancer, least using classical vaccine tech including mRNA. Cancer cells release signature antigen unique tumor, immune system picks tries attack. There's real way make antigens advance, especially general public. also cancer likely stopped cure first, prevention. Keep mind, flu shot suck old tech, sucks great many strains flu include 3-4 vaccine. That's there's new one year. thing HIV- mutates quickly. 

That said, there's lot promise here. mRNA vaccines better targeted older vaccines, much likely Moderna able find something common flu viruses. news bubble hasn‚Äôt informed CV19‚Äòs spread throughout Alaska, I‚Äôm afraid. get late, took there. actually working HIV vaccines while. covid, Zika testing, HIV looked next Quick, everyone send ice cream testing! frozen, non-expired food excepted!! world shut 2 months

I mean depending state still form lockdown. expecting live 25 years old, 24? gets better! maybe shittiest article ever read I'm listening.  India wanted full distribution system place gave anybody shot.  big country lots problems great logistics practiced planned. 

None makes waiting extra month sound like good idea me. - Psychology. (no longer technical use; considered offensive) person borderline intelligence former discarded classification mental retardation, intelligence quotient 50 69.

What children born like country?  Send New Zealand? Right? feel like seriously PTSD damned pandemic. time hear ""two weeks"" ""social distance"" ""we're together"" heart starts race.

On serious note, though, messaging BAD. Like real bad. gotten point public really hard time trusting government public health officials. That's going ramifications future. like Telltale games say, ""X remember said that"". ...sorta. problem cancer immune system identify cancer cells something removed, HIV changes rapidly overwhelms immune system.

For cancer, think it'll possible alternative radiation therapy, mean anyone disease-free.

For HIV, idea think this'll work. I'll reading, I'm skeptical. Yes, spike fusion protein Coronavirus similar design HIV gp41 it‚Äôs drug target,  say China racists Ah, got it. Hey man, I'd go whatever healthcare professionals telling you. think get it, get it. agonize - admirable, one small part bigger plan. 

IMO, front line worker, deserve protected, peace mind - even COVID previously.

But again, I'm random redditor listen us. yeah probly. though aside Baby Boom (which kinda worldwide, tied end WW II) I'm aware generational awareness outside USA  legit still lock down? Florida lockdowns? TIL similar stories coming Israel, UK US? Norway seem country vaccinated very-elderly large numbers. makes angry. Federal government centralized plan. waste time resources. failed state. r/unexpectedSupernatural feel like like everyone saying March wear mask - knew helped told white lie help limited ppe supply would make useful quicker. vaccine, think pretty clear even clear soon I'd vaccinated doses + couple weeks fine, go whatever, throw away masks. know it'll hard enforce rules there's two sets rules depending vaccination status they'll keep saying things vaccinated not. get say one know get vaccinated I'm living like 2019 closest degree given locale far open / closed concerned. I'm sure thought already, pharmacies drive-thru?

Otherwise think plans fine there's need quarantine quick trip. Keep distance anyone else make bee line out.  says ‚Äúgeneration covid‚Äù. see ‚ÄúMillennials‚Äù?

One guy interviewed mentioned Millennials, he‚Äôs oldest person interviewed (at 30). Still long detailed info currently approved vax &amp; still trails here:

**Covid19 Vaccine Tracker** McGill Vaccines Phase 3 Clinical Trials; 34 Vaccines Phase 2 Clinical Trials; 24 Vaccines Phase 1 Clinical Trials Australia closed borders travellers except returning Australians time, kept CV19 mostly out; returning case count back zero three times runaway outbreaks quarantine failures.

Trump closed travel *only China*, world international travel, course delayed CV19 spreading US for... days?

Do get pandemic, closing borders select nations isn‚Äôt going anything protect population? none, thus China closure something infectious disease protection. thank you, scrolled able find exact comment. there's California, 1.2M 40M vaccinated...

I‚Äôm wondering impact COVID Boomer/Millenial-Zennial relationship going forward. 

Given disproportionate rate major illness older folks, young look another example old stealing futures?

What might mean legislation next decade, especially baby boomers become dependent government benefits? Bull Shit. look COVID mRNA vaccine technology compare to, say, COVID inactivated virus attenuated virus technology... looking similar efficacy rates (50-70%, depending subpopulation China world working 100 years reducing number people die car accidents. staff. takes several hours cremate body. finite number equipment.

Also, almost every country know, cannot cremate one person time. cannot mix ashes one person next. issues takes time.

I would say take 4 hours min cremate body, clean start next one. easy, many years ago already vaccine four common cold coronaviruses (of course first vaccine try). respect revolutionary power viruses fatal. quote last part William A. Haseltine article:
...It may helpful picture SARS-CoV-2 variants rapidly growing tree. base tree, single strain virus provide trunk. Ascending tree branches appear, variants contain earlier changes still own. fit survive environment, human population, immediate ancestor. climb higher, variants become numerous, different one another, even fit survive flourish. began variants soon become many thousands, bedeviling attempts mitigate infection disease.

We must prune tree. need reduce number branches, stunt tree. How? methods advocated along. must administer vaccines quickly possible; need reinforce public health measures ‚Äî social distancing, mask-wearing, social isolation. needed appropriate, must incentivize and, necessary, enforce isolation exposed contagious. 

However dangerous thought foe, weeks go confident knew form. realize SARS-CoV-2 shape changer. Like Proteus, changes even hold grasp. Hercules prevailed, separating Anteus mother earth, must clear ever-growing forest virus variants reducing numbers people infected, country everywhere taken root.

I add one thing. Hopefully tomorrow get SARS-COV-2 mutation/design change given maximum transmissibility + Remove ability cause severe disease zero + Gives lifetime immunity/dangerous less outcome SARS-COV-2 versions.
That probably even better vaccine ;-) gamble not. No, would make conveniently honest hypocrites :) understand.

There lot result decades decisions state federal levels things can't get much worse, might well vote side different person least see happens.

But pit one side country people stubborn.

Filter deaths age 65 *extreme*, cannot emphasize enough extreme, decrease covid deaths comparable daily risks accept life. 

‚ÄúYeah, long term ef...‚Äù 

We don‚Äôt shut world *possibility* long term effects, believe recent articles released relative risk clinical manifestations aren‚Äôt drastically inflated risk manifestations else also posted research done from
the UK says little evidence suggest then‚ÄùLong Covid‚Äù symptoms persist longer 12 weeks direct result covid, can‚Äôt find that. great news. one anxious getting infected *while* getting vaccine? mean, presumably huge numbers people gathered together one place... Well, first I'm even contradicting him. said doable agree. I'm saying pretty low bar set. understand people upset Trump set bar high, that's reason Biden play safe.

And secondly Fauci admitted lying several times past. He's better politicians, he's saint. help measure close herd immunity. That‚Äôs why. infection rates drop vaccination rates rise certain level indicate turning point Determined winning days. Good people either way. I‚Äôve long believed US sold expediated access vaccine pro sports leagues $50,000k per dose. NBA alone would paid $96 million. Add sports would close billion dollars could used vaccine distribution. people affected people catch virus, doesn‚Äôt matter work home front lines. catch virus weak lungs, chances taken higher strong/healthy lungs.  want point fingers people weak lungs keep playing blame game. Okay, stuck quarantine hospital avoid long covid? I'm sure point. I'm christian, concur 

We also add sage smudging Ya that's theyre building hospitals they're unprepared...use logic Lucky England say.

No. also shouldnt falsely spread panic harm entire society (such stopping delaying vaccines) can't turn boomers immortals everyone need icu That's true long covid read somewhere FDA reviewing J&amp;J data 1/25. wonder get Phase 3 data week.   EUA application February, next month. 
There big press release week so. Followed application. Followed meeting. knows, since it‚Äôs covid vaccine it‚Äôs long used technology instance maybe meet coffee approve it. may go dog pony show first two times. Even better Manchester drive-thru. God trump awful person. Young children able get vaccine summer trials age group even started yet. unfortunately, parents high risk kids definitely restricting.

As parent probably-not high risk kids, I'll probably still fairly careful well even I'm vaccinated bring home them. Though certainly less careful wave. soon January 20th hits sure fucking hope new administration US better job. flu worse children Covid, atleast sends ICU, though 1% require vent 

‚ÄúAs part study, researchers looked 315 patients hospital diagnosed COVID-19 March 25, 2020, May 15, 2020.

They compared information 1,402 children diagnosed flu Oct. 1, 2019, June 6, 2020. Children asymptomatic positive COVID-19 included cohort.

Of COVID-19 cohort, 17.1 percent hospitalized, 5.7 percent put ICU, 3.2 percent ventilators. children flu, 21.2 percent hospitalized, 7 percent admitted ICU, 1.9 percent downplaying, I'm literally quoting study completely telling facts. article posted yourself. ""My"" citations citations, grossly refused read interpret scientifically name narrative. 

You're clearly gonna change mind I'm done arguing someone refuses read something post sources keeps moving goalposts fit narrative. true natural immunity antibodies protect virus short period time compared diseases? make good point goal setting, getting something different, namely process setting ambitious unrealistic goals (such numbers vaccinated day, groups done time) later redefining criteria success. went discussing tests completed, tests offered before, speculation slippage targets. disagree say think cross purposes. I'm surprised impressed too. fact, North Dakota South Dakota, two states basically worst states per-capita best vaccinations. Varelans medically induced coma Emory University Hospital Atlanta, GA, intensive care, ventilator dialysis since December 12th. 

So young. May rest peace. Meanwhile US rushed bunch states saying 1st shot ofany people wasted they'll need total 3 [many, warned delaying second dose could harm good. Yup competent leadership WH, competent people put charge respective agencies. hope get vaccinations rolled quicker general population now

If J&amp;J vaccines get FDA approval would also help Yes .... J&amp;J

According New York Times, production unlikely reach high volumes April May. didn‚Äôt refute that, they‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre priority group absolutely risk getting virus chance getting vaccine, you‚Äôre getting vaccine time soon. yep surge P cannot account experimental flaws, lower n values make less stable. Rare outcomes make less stable. see people hack good p values nonsense time. P measure model.

Good  always stretch imagine anything all. Imagination good source new idras new trials terrible way justify widespread treatment.

I'd bet know answering straw man here. According CDC-

‚ÄúThe likelihood recovering replication-competent virus also declines onset symptoms. patients mild moderate COVID-19, replication-competent virus recovered 10 days following symptom onset (CDC, unpublished data, 2020; W√∂lfel et al., 2020; Arons et al., 2020; Bullard et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; personal communication Young et al., 2020; Korea CDC, 2020). Recovery replication-competent virus 10 20 days symptom onset documented persons severe COVID-19 that, cases, complicated immunocompromised state.‚Äù

The CDC guidelines ending isolation are

1.	‚Å†10 days symptom onset
2.	‚Å†24 hours without fever fever reducing meds
3.	‚Å†Other symptoms improving.

Using PCR test determine contagiousness longer recommended, positive result triggered ‚Äúdead‚Äù viral material replication-competent (infectious).

So basically, he‚Äôs pretty much guaranteed safe. Right? Like I‚Äôm supposed accept world continue like indefinitely. read COVID patients dying comorbidities, ""serious comorbidities"" seem serious assumption.

If patient cancer, sure that's comorbidity. However, majority cancers aggressive people generally live many years. Diabetes another example comorbidity predominately affects elderly, otherwise manageable indefinitely. centres probably open 12 hrs/day... school-worker risk catching stay-at-home worker, regardless health status?

""Two women flew Auckland Fiji later tested positive Covid-19 transited New Zealand, Ministry Health says.""  wasnt clear mean post covid syndrome.

As post covid syndrome media calling ""long haulers"". Majority mild cases later developed syndrome indeed, symptoms always matching acute illness. cases imaging studies blood tests come back clean therefore pathophysiology yet known hypothesize low level vasculities going perhaps sort MCAS involvement among things..

What understood article means post covid syndrome hospitalized severe complications, lets say lung damage, going back home damage didnt heal worsen either return back hospital unfortunately passed away.

Those two completly different things referring too? Ah shit. go again. 7 day average 850k (and -- first shots. Using White House source data, especially used evaluate current president, risky business.

Also, note vaguely specified rate administered vaccines approaching 1 million per day

What mean ""approaching 1 million""? 1000 approaching 1 million start 0. mean close. obvious yet 1 million even White House claiming already is.

Based website, US approximately 300k vaccinations per day: basically number new cases day putting minimum hour simplicity. Depending you‚Äôre getting may sit room waiting nurse doctor nurse (I did, like half hour nurse coming needle vaccine actually getting shot).

But yes, good it. fair enough.

however, plenty good sources dismissing concerns vaccine. fair accused sort misinformation, providing one side unfortunate story.

the happened Portugal, lady died days taking vaccine. autopsy concluded related. spreading story without context would misinformation.

in end, really spreading stories -hopefully everything points - statistical irrelevance, even true, unfortunate are.

we should, instead focusing anecdotal evidence, spreading fact vaccine population, personal preference count. vaccine device counter disease population, personal medicine. that's really work, personal level. works enough people decide take it.

there thousands medicines commercially available cause death vulnerable people, yet talk much it.

no need apologise. there's reason get heated this. things hands. personally, trust case. Yes, one late 60s one early 70s asthma high blood pressure. staying home retired, help us childcare sometimes, feel immensely guilty whenever go out. agree, but, 2,000 km New Zealand touch Sydney. 2,000 km UK Russia.

The absolute distance actually kinda useless consider population density travel, plus varying responses across many nations would definitely factor faster spread UK compared NZ.

Similarly Japan reach North South Korea, China, Taiwain, Philippines (barely), Russia bumfuck nowhere Russia. nearest neighbours good job help also good job.

No threatening nuke countries randomly nice change pace  detractors realize numbers already starting trend mid late August continued increase Sept 7 school would've impact numbers considering 6 7 day incubation period average.

I'm saying schools cause. pretty clear case number started rising August opened. keeping open numbers kept rising certainly help. goal everyone wants vaccine vaccinated September. Since can‚Äôt ever see point restrictions would place 95% effective vaccine one hospital except extremely misfortunate, would say we‚Äôre fairly normal summer. Fairly normal everything open except concerts maybe, still requiring masks grocery stores hospitals. large portion flu deaths caused bacterial pneumonia secondary viral infection. Idk anyone killed flu year. reason know people killed dead covid. think would best choice deliver covid tests around UK... know yet prevents it, early Israel datas say helps reducing spread, nothing definite. can't scale vaccination capacity, it'll much slower that, they'll spending half time giving second doses. risky going gym (my gym moved half stuff outdoors)? going? wear mask keep distance others wipe everything, touch face etc.

US vaccination rate also outpacing US infection rate? Oh please let go bust Yes, getting 1 2 shots wait 3 months getting next scientific evidence could even work. words, lets watch England England again. 2 million per week would take 33 weeks everyone UK wanted vaccine. 

It probably 22 weeks rate vaccinate everyone wants it. Around 5 months. cover mine sprinkles  vaccine prevent getting spreading it. reduce symptoms get it, bad could ran unchecked.

Hope doesn‚Äôt come back bite us. difficult one EU secured vaccines much cheaper rate UK has. Yes getting later (&amp; could argue getting sooner protecting economy?) going paying arse rest lifetimes. nothing article, obviously still need wear mask regardless vaccination status since little vaccinated people restrictions nowhere near lifted

However come summer, everyone actually vaccinated experts predicting, absolutely reasoning keep mask mandates Well throw enough shit wall something bound stick eventually. contradicted many times mask use

Literally once. year ago. apologized many times. 

Fauci knows us combined. agree, that's also massive fuck younger people even getting offered vaccine. would lead flouting lockdown rules. impossible detection rates remained same.

The huge first wave massively underdiagnosed almost testing capacity, US testing millions every day IIRC.

The fatality rate shows much detection rate improved. end first wave, one death every 20 people diagnosed virus, November one 40 right now, one 60. Congrats. Doesn‚Äôt change answer still change point vaccinate earlier approve earlier opposed able afford cost. Thought Astra probably months away weeks? move April-ish? I'm sure JCVI know much scientists created vaccines ran clinical trials, test following dosage reccomended. 

 15,000,000 infecting people 42% time vs 7,500,000 people infecting others 10% time? think sounds better? American Massch...I cant spell that. Boston. mention degrade yellow plastic. title seems like calling 'rona saying ""come bruv"". I've going gym mask almost every day since May

No outbreaks vaccinating people around clock run out. Yes, know issues people wait longer second dose, lengthening time shot 1 shot 2 3 weeks deemed likely safe Health Canada. I‚Äôd happy go get shot 3am Tuesday to. Time everything right now.

In Ontario LTC old folks getting doses schedule 21 28 days apart due immune systems good. Everyone else 42 days required.  Believe not, Asian people looking forward masking mandates gone much anyone else. to, enjoy it.

There's big difference masking choice masking government needs it.

Once certain amount vaccinations occurred, strictness mask mandates going decline worldwide. may happen time soon, coming. know, hire petrer trained paid people would probably get vaccine. Thanks - super interesting. news sources would cite relevant studies available guess much ask. makes happy somehow jealous.
Greetings Mexico Again, point, Tories succeeded understand logistical capabilities power NHS. ""If get ~~60000~~ ~~80000~~ ~~100k~~ ~~200k~~ 2 Million deaths, done great job.""  Fauci predicted 9 last 4 Covid disasters. Ok cool yet. They're still pressing hard it. :/ Unless reach least 70% population vaccinated June (lol, likely), think asking another year bullshit. Canada: ‚ÄúY‚Äôall getting vaccinated?‚Äù slow process everyone start many restrictions far evidence suggest, confirm, B117 variant 50% infectious original type, UK worried healthcare capacity. never evidence suggest lethality changed. Thats awesome. Canada 2 dose vaccine giving away peoples second dose saying one enough get enough. great. Thank hope gets better too. Surprised many people similar position actually - way tell people days Lets hear definition ""loads"". even, ""bad news"", scientific fact. technology used 2 dose vaccines like Astrazeneca Sputnik. vaccine absolutely nothing different makes 1 shot better 1 shot vaccine. Well say they'd submit 21st? that's case they'll probably press release That's said. agreeing think anyone thinks cure. something lot people deficient in, proven make COVID worse, least strongly correlated seriousness COVID given person. literally dirt cheap. theres reason everyone taking it. Actually none.

It cost, upside.  really ridiculous figure, wonder settled 30%. say 50%, 70%, heck let's run 90%! Possibly. also think masking seriously helpful. However, think spread different country, lot people (including virologists) think high Italy's New York's first rounds, since many asymptomatic cases, leading amount deaths... yet.

I'm sure plenty people died home, unknown, work, chalked instead (those separate death categories here, take time tally analyze those). that, due lack testing, many may unable officially counted COVID deaths, even were. Post-mortem testing thing here. poor person. care. Seriously give out. rather rich person gets going waste 14 states administered less 40 percent distributed vaccines. problem absolutely distribution concerns low efficacity Sinovac?

Also 1918 medical technology. antibiotics treat secondary pneumonias, mass produced useful ventilators, widely used IVs, limited distribution vasopressors treat hypotension, flu vaccine. didn‚Äôt even know influenza virus yet!

Early guidance washing hands social distancing. saying isn‚Äôt true? üòÇ good day stay safe there. holy grail flu research develop ‚Äúuniversal flu vaccine‚Äù would recognize every strain wouldn‚Äôt need remake vaccine every year. 

The problems approach far immune system doesn‚Äôt make strong response parts virus conserved different strains. hope mRNA vaccine might able overcome problem.  yet taint remains...   AZ J&amp;J approved enough unless big production issues/delays. EU ordered 300 million each. Also Pfizer double production Europe March on. believe died side effects vaccine. think fever nausea contributed. 

There lifespans already limited regardless vaccine. normal, otherwise healthy 80 year olds. good (if better) flu vaccines. misinformation propaganda quite effective - especially spread people looking specific outcomes; i.e. looking fool people color believing immune COVID19. Yes. Unfortunately way lot diseases including asthma diabetes. Higher levels Comorbid conditions, unequal access care, socioeconomic inequalities. Democrats typically least try get spread it, also try help working class people. Basically 30 frail elderly people died mild side effects

Would similarly unconcerned 30 frail elderly people dying average person taking vaccine seem danger.

The average person getting infected COVID isn‚Äôt much danger either. Well gay fuck 

Hello boooyyssss AstraZeneca real question mark. Oxford vaccine works (questionable data far lack fda approval remains ominous) meet timeline. not, unfortunately take substantially longer  Roll tide Boris bad case Covid learned it.

Our Idiot Chief made theater production slight (or non existant) case instead taking seriously. seriously suggested chlorox veins spotlights asses. 

400,000 dead high ranking Republicans get Regeneron. ah okay. confused sec. makes sense haha Same. last critical years baby. don‚Äôt like think it. know. That‚Äôs said people really, really bad health (and mean close death) terminally ill seek professional opinion studies across world would gotten positive cases multiple variants, vaccines 90-95% effective percentage whatever variants common wide variety countries.

also posts saying vaccines work known variants far. Yeah phobia needles I'll get vaccine matter Honestly survives gets active keep around longer anything else Bug search well.

But sending message Trump tainted building here

Yeah, problem here. supposed keen injected ""vaccines"" vaccines (as know it). Yet completely new (the word 'experimental' comes mind) type 'vaccine' blindly trusted.

1. No, seems short term manipulation human genetics: synthesized rna triggering human cells manufuctaring corona-like proteine, immune response triggered. seems litterally manipulating human genomes. Even temporary, lasting, still human genetic manipulation (not alteration).
2. agree. wary point 1, science current point flawless enough manipulating human genomes into, even temporarily, replicating invasive proteines without problematic outcome.
3. agree. point ethical approach. Stating pharmaceutical industries ""do can"" bit iffy. industry, factual economic business, exact science using science make profit shareholders.  Oxford play already UK. half administering yesterday. 400 people small town two hours. don‚Äôt think clinical trials would required situation ‚Äúrebuild.‚Äù

i seen phrased way, post back effectively saying process proven, covid vaccine would need new studies. would treated like yearly flu vaccine (no trials, least data saved case) Personally think lockdowns stupid, particularly they‚Äôre ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù everyone still go Walmart Home Depot -IMO hurt small businesses. Either lockdown hard don‚Äôt lockdown all. However, using North Korea data nearly study laughable. wouldn‚Äôt trust data subject coming official North Korean sources.  get vaccine first pint, everybody age 9 vaccinated week. know USA this. 

One reason: Trump making sense. wonder Florida everyone would saying states fault. said runs night too. guess government haven‚Äôt really got involved let NHS best definitely includes oxford. hospital trust one site pfizer astra zeneca done couple weeks. British Army leading logistics NHS delivering. Minimal input Boris morons really. example say town 1M people. might number vaccine distribution locations town 750k. 

Why? Well place physical size generally don‚Äôt mad rush folks getting vaccine. folks administering vaccines normally underutilized. 

Now covid hits. town 750k residents needs vaccinate less people. working number medical facilities. 

Now let‚Äôs talk supply chain. Shipping 100 packages fairly easy. single person corrsinate logistica. Shipping 4000 boxes requires entire team handle logistics. 

As orgs scale beuraceacy they‚Äôll end able more, person chain less. 

That‚Äôs smaller countries towns edge we‚Äôll run Loool. Ok. read anything drugs? fuck brain forever. I'm going places like kramer every episode seinfeld long. actual process cremating single body take anywhere 3 5 hours. slowing things making progress quickly seems working well except [pensioners decide turn vaccination appointment cause massive queues.

Pensioners love early birds.. stick appointment times though! UK fast start vaccine use, quite highest per million world close. sure like complimenting Boris. far vaccination going well. part run NHS army, people trust. Also Matt Hancock basically hands-off knows fucks he'll dragged streets. know wasn't. Forgive came way. Millions people COVID developed spike antibodies. best place start looking auto-immune responses, people natural disease.

It's higher chance get auto-immune responses dead virua vaccines adenovirus vaccines (which trigger random antibodies). much better studied vaccine delivery systems. Sorry, meant 500,000 per day. 3,500,000 per week. Little stabs little stabs  wellbutrin chantix.  Well congratulations I‚Äôm hell hole called US I‚Äôll probably see vaccination opportunity pop months eventually contract anti-science cretins Thank you, makes sense! That's interesting. note entirely possible catch covid approximately time get vaccine. fact, standing line vaccine un-vaccinated people, could catch them.

If turns immune response somehow attacks sense smell, expect we'll learn mechanism couple years. now, that's possibly coincidental. Ahh makes sense! Interesting, talking someone works one vaccine sites US, said projecting 47 weeks vaccinate 70% population. Hey, anyone remember means coronavirus vaccine slower reach UK

Or plan shun EU vaccine scheme ‚Äòunforgivable‚Äô, say critics Ooh. get selfish prick well?

I‚Äôll start small see get right. ‚ÄúNo can‚Äôt last rolo‚Äù. Malaysia, China. Stop lying internet want taken seriously. also seriously underestimating long athletes train Olympics. people set PB year Olympics can't keep level up. postpone Olympics 2022 means another Olympic year trainingwise (which means qualification races months beforehand well) break Olympics next (2023 often already qualification year 2024). 1/2 vaccinated estimated 10% infected back summer. study way off. CDC also say 90mil last month. Everything spreads like crazy prisons it‚Äôs possible much risk mitigation. Another way look prisoners medical care paid tax payers it‚Äôs better everyone get vaccinated. prefer take steps vaccinate ASAP prevent unnecessary deaths, burdens healthcare systems tax payer costs. surprised find efficient promise pups reopening line start realizing long term

No. not, though. Facts often get downvoted here. ok, I'm sure telling us ackshually Belgium appropriate comparison Sweden.

Hmmm no? Ackshually never denied Sweden deaths Denmark, understand point really trolling. stupid question all. I‚Äôm scientist field, understanding reduce risk mutation, transmission virus increases risk mutation (so reducing transmissibility virus reduce risk mutation. Making morale judgments people's lifestyles decide ""worthy"" vaccine dangerous path go in.

IF smokers increased risk, high priority accordance risk. ""saving smokers type people want save."" hospital capacity, mortality rates, data care feelings different types people. smokers end hospital often die often, line vaccines accordingly.

That said, articles I've read smokers vs COVID may extra protection. waste lot time doom scrolling, seen anything smokers higher risk..... decision surprising me. decision based actual science actually higher risk, decision sound really actively ignore feelings it.

Giving vaccine people withholding based feelings dangerous road. fat people? Obese definitely higher risk... withhold vaccine somebody can't keep eating much lazy non-exerciser? exercise regularly priority care bodies? felons? murders rapists get vaccine housed tight quarters? Nebraska Governor Ricketts recent statements (which later walked back) undocumented immigrants work meat packing plants eligible? I'm guessing left half spectrum one makes go ""wtf,"" far right that's legitimate concern. sure want basing gets vaccines via somebody's (or public large's) opinion value humans?

No. Let's vaccinate highest risk exposure bad illness, leave morale judgments afterward.

(But let's also double check science one, CDC) surprised learn kidney transplants least, age priority age 18... Seems messed 19 year old kidney failure competing 80 year olds transplant Well, least you‚Äôre self aware enough recognize initial knee jerk reaction probably needs reconsidered. admire that. Excellent stock fore engine photo. edited LA City engine anyone cares. Pay money stay home? [They used money relief gamble using global figures, let use well. 7-day avg. COVID deaths 13,000 per day right now. *little* 3700, 3x.

This thread gotten little cavalier dismissals, justified, there's way much fear mongering, comparing virus car crashes pretty dumb. rember correctly, thats bs, shouldnt 80%? Maybe USA health care system isn‚Äôt good claim is. That‚Äôs fine don‚Äôt say hard numbers matter percent that‚Äôs false. amazing considering virus came Europe. takes time analyze format data publication, mention legal PR review. I'm sure steps review scientific data would ethical publish well.  I‚Äôve going 3-5x per week since gym opened back Memorial Day. It‚Äôs savior mental well well keeping physically healthy. One reason: trump  Lmfao, love see comments like random places There's one every fucking post, there? much ask wait week two start dropping good news? disappear like miracle - Donald J Trump   ***All boarders*** ones Asia. Procurement vacccines responsibility federal government. good. replying comment talking Hispanics. correct there‚Äôs bunch fat people America, backgrounds. Asian Americans smoke lot, respiratory infection, isn‚Äôt rocket science people weak lungs taken out. Weak lungs come smoking obese. 40 year old chance death covid infected 1 2000. Vaccine risk 0. not! Thank yep, check history constant near constant trolling short, there‚Äôs guarantee won‚Äôt get again. 1 state, Maharashtra I'll always happier larger number people getting potentially life saving vaccine yes, even smaller percentage people. Herd immunity goal, right vaccine immunity attainable discounted exactly I'm getting smell. Also 22 extremely mild case. Anything meat cooked smells like chicken parmesan.

All hand sanitizer smells like straight alcohol too. Taste fine tho. Gracias hermanos! used hate attitude. People think they‚Äôre smarter everybody else they‚Äôre guardrails. guardrails seat belts turned ‚Äúyou happy locked inside apartment alone years necessary.‚Äù Maybe I‚Äôm getting old crotchety like them, can‚Äôt abide that. says lot day long... Also fundamentalism obsessing's old pieces paper. Tradition important, something new useful, adapt use current situation. reason Westerners become addicted meeting fantasies idealistic nonsense instead following common sense. jokes aside, bunch places seeing better retirement balance books.  Makes realize United States government incompetent/frustrating many times, we‚Äôre still lucky live somewhere rich enough expect receiving vaccine somewhere near future #1 obesity opioid use baybeeeeee.

But seriously though suck lot things, already robust vaccination networks built years ago good luck.gif specially interesting learn Bolsonaro incentivizes destruction Amazon, also tried bring taxes imported oxigen 3 weeks horrible crisis Manaus.


This man gonna kill Brazilians, whole planet ...So article literally rewording Fauci already said would go back normal Fall. USA could put numbers ah ok. actually disagree, think opposite true prove completely wrong decision. dont time job badly twice, might aswell properly once.

Either way, time tell, see 12 months one us vindicated. another aspect US Pfizer/Moderna right now. 

the UK getting Astrazeneca alongside Pfizer helps lot. Astrazeneca delivers LOT vaccines pfizer moderna According UK reported lowest number daily new cases since December 26th. Wait would give marketing lectures elderly people?

For easy sales gullible people. Like germany used call ""Kaffeefahrten"", sure equivalents exists places. Yeah people compared Israel‚Äôs vaccination quote etc I‚Äôm looking info BTI shortly France [a lot though. 

It's partly [government also many people [being skeptical French health ministry numbers quoted COVIDTracker website, 516 persons vaccinated Jan. stark contrast fast pace vaccination European countries. U.K., campaign started two weeks rest Europe, million people already inoculated. Look canada.we royally fucked vaccination efforts. don‚Äôt think report says much. It‚Äôs extremely biased source - remote education business!

The comparison make support point isn‚Äôt relevant group society whole. course teachers infected people work mostly home. surprise there, information kids‚Äô infectivity either.

A relevant comparison would people work humans no-school settings. example comparing adults don‚Äôt work home.  zoom? us vaccinating similar rate UK. believe numbers, prima facie? Go wv dhhr website. planning public knowledge sub mix extremes point, regular folks stopped visiting it. Notice massive drop comments past months. Every thread shit, anti-mitigation / virus skeptic / data skeptic people versus overly paranoid people, many former trying tie politics (""the leftsts want take away freedom, never reopen, want everyone poor, jobless, welfare!""). Hospitalization rates Israel expected increase following days, despite 20% people you, despite lockdown enforced military checkpoints roadblocks.

Don't spread false hopes fast return normal. It‚Äôs almost like complex scenario multiple variables could alter estimated projections. He‚Äôs fuckin clairvoyant - expect?  Almost like nationalized medicine helps nation.   soon cure development finishes pretty much screwed replying comment talking Hispanics. yes you‚Äôre right there‚Äôs fat people everywhere America. saying shots? 100 million people fully vaccinated? Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, study published [*The New England Journal December found **protection start 12 days first shot reaches 52% effectiveness weeks later. week second vaccination, effectiveness rate hits 95%.** [application Moderna reported **protection rate 51% two weeks first immunization 94% two weeks second dose.** sure universally true FL. 

My dad got shot Saturday. signed online (maybe week ago), got date / time. 

Police / Nat Guard verified appointment arrived, got jabbed, waited 15 minutes observations, verified date go back second, left. Said 30 minutes total start finish. 

My mom wait severe allergic reactions previous cancer treatment makes things little complicated. getting thumbs / date Wednesday. 

No massive lines. Super simple. Similar story friends.  Brits lost war plaque long ago edited post made comment. 

There good evidence 12 weeks dose 1 2 effective.  also means vaccinate another 8 weeks vulnerable people. another 8x number people vaccinated dose 1 much effective population overall. longer most/all countries world original sin horrendous heresy people stop using ""detected cases"" way measure things. really stupid. comparing day yearly mortality. No? idea about. explaining vaccine already tested, successfully, many places around world, tests undoubtedly involved Japanese participants overseas, yet xenophobic government/nationalist types stubborn reluctant trust results, leading people claiming (falsely) tested Japanese. past 4 days I‚Äôve worn mask 9 hours day confined space lots noise around. It‚Äôs big deal, anyone says needs stop fucking whinny. got vaccinated yesterday happening weekends. Yeah, suspected :) really. Shakey napkin maths...those vaccinated week end 31st Dec (786,000) due week (by 21st) latest, assuming 21 day rule. Astra Zennica wasnt approved 30/12 presumably pfizer. around 60% 3 days end week. agree. think would good try lottery system point. Sign database get pulled, chance make appointments shots, otherwise goes next person. Oh totally agreed. Plus mix fact california poor vaccine uptake (measles/mumps outbreak) vs. places like West Virginia highest percentage vaccine uptake school age children, data starts skew.

 However, definitely odd california distributed low percentage doses. really many people concentrated area, easier proper planning Depends - China parts Japan common thing even Covid. Canadian nurse think patients coworkers would accept masks permanent thing, right mask compliance even 100% (a lot people take mask eat/drink ""forget"" put back on, remind them) middle worst surge right now. mean US vaccinating similar rate UK. clear comments OP know math works Feels like bottom rungers debating bigger opportunity improve...  fear. sometimes work industrial refrigeration anhydrous ammonia refrigerant. times ammonia leak I'm standing 2 feet away. alarms nose got little alarm went off. 

I lost smell days Covid contemplating ammonia work future. I'd say 4-6 weeks. Seek approval within 2 so, three weeks thereafter. Got it. Thank you. entirely dependent vaccines preventing transmission. word pandemic implies global. 

epidemic though threshold google. basically xx/100k whatever number Cosmo‚Äôs [Feb. 2021 UK example. I've personally heard people say myself. least yesterday, #50 speed vaccine rollout, too.

My step-sister nurse deals COVID patients. doses vaccine, though, people immediate family high-risk, luckily. UK, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Canada, Japan, Bahamas, Korea require negative test pre-departure. US require well starting 1/26.

I trust anyone quarantine themself correctly 10-14 days. People selfish entitled. takes spoiled rest.  Napoleon tried, failed. 10 hour day 100 minutes per hour 100 seconds per minute. length second same. I've read terrorist chief selling pardons. There's two vaccines set come online easier storage tens millions doeses immediately available. JJ expected one shot (they 2 shot trial too) US invest enough military clearly.. 


/s  Precisely, like Star Wars, I'm going X-Wing! No... lol. probably happens every time admin changes time probably disinfected due coronavirus. hate country normal hammer? 78, look Graphic Bangkok Post. UK logistics lead team military logistics heads NHS - they're incorporating lots public private infrastructure (including lots pharmacies \[drugstores\], courier services, they're even talking using closed pubs!) Apparently wait months till get one US. Can‚Äôt wait till things start turn around supply exist?  Well, ""marketing lectures"" infamous scam elders specially families around. try sell lots stuff elders. reddit loves doom gloom hates anything gives hope.  found eligible schedule vaccine appointment. appointments available Virginia, walgreens West Virginia go appointments around clock. mean how? 50% preventing getting corona, 90%+ protecting severe cases.

Of course, western media focus 50%, level measuring symptoms, Pfizer would low 19% Yeah mean poor choices, level acceptance taken given litrally caught everyone pants were, though pretty egregious. 

That said think people see light end tunnel. decreasing positivity rate increases population size needed make difference. instance, positivity rate 7%, North Dakota's population would need 8.1 million 7.1x number cases. highest positivity rate gives estimate minimum population size needed. ion seeks electrons, know much. think Biden smart goal, underpromise overdeliver. NHS you‚Äôre eating everything worked mfer  Trump busy trying coup 1400 addition 600 already voted for? Making 2000 total promise made (before vote 600). Che Guevara, one key figures behind Cuban Revolution, Cuba despite $6k gdp\capita sends medical workers developing countries g8 countries combined, even though that's comparing population 11m nearly billion. medical workers helped worldwide Corona virus, including first world countries like Italy Spain...

Now exactly time dust che t-shirts, show selfless focused helping people be, even come humble origins.

A successful beginning rollout vaccinations great, sure, come close excusing rollercoaster fuckups hypocrisy government provided last year. mention government yet gone medical community's advice wish change interval period doses 3 weeks 12 weeks, despite zero testing done 12 week interval; yet colossal stupidity lead people dying filling hospitals get cocky bored dose 1 dose 2; far early make claims like ""the UK gov got one right""."
