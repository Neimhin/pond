Humans nature tribal. connect closely approximately 150 individuals. “processing capacity” social interaction. I'm hoping confirmation soon. think unreasonable do. Especially 30s offered vaccine yet widely. they're pushing second lot, insensitive worst requirements entry.   Interesting surprising. CCP obsessed saving face. Beyond that, Chinese New Year important holiday year. implement lock right before, would seriously anger/demoralize entire populace. surprising waited almost last minute determine a) can't contained traditional methods b) dangerous enough cancel Chinese New Year.    fair, evidence early pandemic. It’s surprise got filed away conspiracy nonsense. mention, time important things think figure out. 

It perfectly reasonable dismiss back then, like it’s reasonable look consider possibility...because new information come light.

And still don’t KNOW escaped lab, people like Fauci Gottleib saying it’s possibility investigated.  cant speak others would think China it, bet ass U.S. nations making/studying virus' like exact way. already know U.S. bunch deadly virus' researched right U.S.. lab leak China, matter time thing happens U.S. feel bad anybody working water treatment plant tomorrow. hella smelly.  think hypothesis checked seriously too. 

As Fauci.

That doesn’t mean scientific consensus changing. scientific consensus AFAIK enough evidence found prove anything rule anything or. Ok, mind open world up? run acceptable risk every single thing planet. Driving acceptable risk far far far likely die car accident covid point. 

There still lingering cases measles going around, stay inside wear masks that’s eradicated. 

Even CDC said point you’re vaccinated, go indoors without masks people. go standard theirs? sister turns 12 july, family waiting genome virus look like came natural evolution.

How know this? [Looks like 63.7% me. Probably day two Croatia beautiful well worth trip. They're reason, would help much.   Shit, theres huge one Galveston, Tx bunch people freaked harvey hit, worried facility got post link story Imagine either oblivious basic public health precautions, much sociopath aware dangers choose anyway. 3 turns case, suppose technically accomplished goal… doesn’t make sense me, else determine well vaccine working?  Well good news won’t rush regardless much want school year!

And saw local cases pretty low that’s good too. still high (25/100k) we’re taking advantage summer weather much outside stuff curbside restaurants / stores. supposed immune compromised? likely never able get vaccine correct? long wear mask social distance protect them? understand may sound flippant unfair point go back living, right? best way protect herd immunity got vaccine moment could. Talk anti vaxxers, reason can’t nice things 

As kids, it’s bummer agree, 12 get afaik September they’re shooting believe 2 up. 

But kids aren’t particularly high risk. know it’s risk situation, supposed keep middle next year every single kid get shot? Compare articles detailing India’s known gross underreporting China’s unknown underreporting seeing discrepancy vitriol hilarious don’t paraphrase show said. Hint: done consistently present facts known, and/or ask investigation done. Seasonal state hot everyone stays inside. spiked South summer everyone inside AC.

I would imagine outside camp would safer year last year, there's lower prevalence virus due many vaccinated. school district really wealthy. chromebooks 30% kids big improvement. questioned released. That's much different imprisoned. every kid access chromebook/computer NYC? That's crazy me. imagine many schools infrastructure every kid internet computers home.

There's biologically plausible mechanism vaccine could decrease sensitivity and/or production androgens cause male pattern baldness.

Male pattern baldness suddenly reverses without explanation tends actually male pattern baldness.

Stress-related hair loss definitely thing. ton covid-related stress, could easily caused hair loss mimicked male pattern baldness. vaccinated, covid stress gone, boom. Hair comes back. Dude everything asked fucking year. didn’t travel, didn’t go peoples houses, didn’t see anyone year.l could help high risk individuals. I’m sorry interested protecting idiots Meanwhile US still allow unrestricted exports still unvaccinated healthcare workers across world. concept that's good reality really work? There's countless times university told come read certain chapter bunch midterms study something. I'm glad we're making competition I’m person said said. said don’t care people refuse get it. I’ve literally done every single thing asked year. almost everyone else travelled Christmas balked rules, stayed house didn’t get within 6 feet anyone else year. I’m sorry don’t patience mental capacity continue try protect people something don’t won’t protect against. 

The whole purpose protect high risk individuals keep hospitals overrun. longer issue highest risk people well almost everyone states opportunity get vaxxed months now. 

I said variant escapes immunity go back best help people high risk there’s new vaccine. But, I’m sorry can’t asked love way forever. frankly people unwilling get shot, that’s point. number problems idea - may merit - spacing shots higher efficacy. 

1. say, crisis trying outrun, months wait.
2. Logistics tracking people multiple months. J&amp;J's single shot highly preferred transient populations reason already.
3. AstraZeneca never actually *trialed* idea, inherently speculative something approved countries strict licensing regimes. Anyway, beyond done

That's good idea. Crazy fast got two slow get two three. Detained/interrogated/etc - take pick 
Last checked never given court sentence. excellent longform summary reasons people taking lab leak hypothesis seriously. thought balanced admittedly made reconsider thoughts issue. good point - probably continue wear masks son feel weird. existing risk factor definitely concern. go outside camp last year worked fine. based data have, definitely seems like thing seasonal, rates went much lower NJ soon warm weather set in. right looked up, vaccinated elderly person similar-ish risk unvaccinated young adult.

So case fair everyone follows rules, everyone roughly similar effective risk category. National Asparagus Day? That's amazing gorged asparagus dinner tonight. live would say still 85-90% mask wearing indoors. see less people wearing outside.

I think people literally wear mask day die. probably buried one. Imagine partisan culture wars lmao  mean, I'm gonna blame gerrymandering place. Also antivoting laws issue many many years. Texas place votes bluer would think, like states large rural populations tends lean certain way haven’t done yet. Yeah think that's we're going - mean we've mostly avoided indoor spaces son past year anyway, went beach go bathroom, taking get ice cream, etc. talked he's cool double-masking need indoor spaces longer periods. Hopefully continue good direction. hope get vaccine trials done younger kids school time, though also want rush it! J&amp;J fine, showed good efficacy one dose.

This sort finding concerns people getting one dose approved two dose shot regimes. Either that's vaccination policy, forget, second shot winds shortage. Try reading article. highly doubt wearing masks outside since that's really done anywhere UK. Yep, plenty evidence show ccp knew month new virus whose origins wuhan anything it. effort save face, covered news long possible couldn’t anymore. don’t necessarily think members government knew severity ramifications locking sooner. unwillingness acknowledge problem month made worldwide pandemic.

Right?! He'll never say he's convinced one way other. makes sense want everyone chance vaccination opening things fully. Vaccines opened everyone 4/15, takes 6 weeks full protection (if get Moderna) gave general population 2 weeks opened up, get vaccine fully protected 6/15. think that's reasonable fair. We've worn masks year now, weeks hurt. states something common. anyone know is? Vaccine procurement too. That's EU right, us good job administration the,.

“I spoke Nick’s article last week Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, renowned Columbia University virus hunter one five co-authors seminal “proximal origin” paper.
He favored natural origin theory, said, part assumed Wuhan Institute’s 2019 work SARS-like viruses done top-level BSL-4 lab, cleared operate 2017. (State Department cables 2018 raised questions well-run lab was.)
But later learned studies Dr. Shi’s name showing work considers dangerous done level BSL-2 labs, considers highly porous leaks, 2016, 2020.
“That’s screwed up,” said. “It shouldn’t happened. People looking bat viruses BSL-2 labs. view changed.”
That still not, pointed out, direct evidence lab leak. proof leak.” point, lot people originally saying “follow science” thrown window exchange “more restrictions = better matter what.” It’s flipped version antimaskers doing. makes sense want everyone chance vaccination opening things fully. Vaccines opened everyone 4/15, takes 6 weeks full protection (if get Moderna) gave general population 2 weeks opened up, get vaccine fully protected 6/15. think that's reasonable fair. We've worn masks year now, weeks hurt. Yeah, that's everyone assumes. turned positive cases came substantially reduced potential spread. I'm sure similar studies done events hosted US. Sometimes irregular heartbeat happens. get thyroid hormone low, brother always response stress. happens again, maybe ask doctor tests, happens people least once. said makes sense all.

""Considering"" successful vaccination strategy means cause concern you? think vaccines do? One persons policy approach included calling hoax didn’t listen experts. embarrassingly got it. 

The persons policy included listening experts. Put people positions weren’t son law good experience. 

Keep repeating lies it’s guys lost landslide. Adults charge. It’s seeing good results now. avocado toast best you’re going get economics keeping you, God, eat avocado toast! think biggest problem actual anti-vaxxers, people bothering caring. look young people gotten it.  really good point. Even though I'm NJ one hardest hit along, still county-based variations. actually checked here, even worst NJ county 9 cases per 100,000 bad! reducing quickly, even though checked week ago numbers seem way better already. WTF? say useless, lets say 2 countries war deal covid domestically - would shut production weapons, strain supply lines, overwhelm hospitals serve useful distractions. 

It's also possible research strain early stages later would developed something infectious possibly something much lethal less infectious. 

Either way lab leak I'd place bets researcher fucking dropping something keeping mouth shut get trouble rather evil diabolical master military plan. wanting go? 

Luckily us, NJ vax rates high even moreso community. I'll bring kids stores short periods time, things outdoors anyway. plan bring restaurants right now.

My kids school since September going summer camp. Sure. source includes sentences responding to, know context? also states high natural immunity need many people vaccinated protected. Sure, lot people died, left natural immunity far good vaccines. breakthrough rate same. vaccines need kept colder others. still says Pfizer vaccines need Ultra Low Temp. I'm happy rebuilding Terminal A. Long overdue. I'm sure B happen next. I'm sure stung United closed old Continental hub Cleveland. source quotes making up?  I. vouch mask wearing outdoors hot summer weather, especially since time 70% adults vaccinated.

I hope allow conventions happen without masking/distancing too. show fantastic. movie actually picks 5 minutes story show (season 1 eventually 3 4 seasons total) leaves off. also get's rid hiccups thing ex ever worth shit. could trick getting pissed get rid persistent hiccups. Covid already becoming less deadly treatments improved vaccination. There's hope treatments come future bring even lower. takes time people adjust. helping move things along. it? dropet transmission seen biggest problem respiratory issues spread via droplets.

Here's July 2020 Penn. quote article:

""Dr. O’Donnell lead author Penn Medicine Statement Question Droplet Airborne Transmission SARS-CoV-2 issued late July year.

Succinct straightforward, statement puts forward expert opinion Penn Healthcare Epidemiologists’ Workgroup:

\- study demonstrated actual clinical evidence airborne transmission SARS-CoV-2

\- overwhelming majority transmission SARS-CoV-2 via large respiratory droplets conclusively demonstrated contact tracing studies, cluster investigations, lack infection spread hospital settings universal masking protocols low estimated""

So saying? saying droplet transmission wrong thing worry about?

It appears feared droplets cautioned airborne. I'm sure upset about.

Therefore, transmission COVID-19 virus occur direct contact infected people indirect contact surfaces immediate environment objects used infected person (e.g., stethoscope thermometer).

Airborne transmission different droplet transmission refers presence microbes within droplet nuclei, generally considered particles &lt;5μm diameter, remain air long periods time transmitted others distances greater 1 m.In context COVID-19, airborne transmission may possible specific circumstances settings procedures support treatments generate aerosols performed; i.e., endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration nebulized treatment, manual ventilation intubation, turning patient prone position, disconnecting patient ventilator, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

As thinking I'm saying, perhaps practice would know 15 people infected didn’t know people were.

Assuming actually bother send post event test results, test presumably marked belonging pilot events, positive results known come events, even know test belongs to.

And leaves wonder tests individually registered attendees, reliant attendee accurately self labelling test contact details, hence wonder tracing someone contact details for.

TL;DR original assumption based seeming reliance self labelling incorrect, cool, idc, I'd prefer wrong. I'd like think government fuck things 100% time.

Dismisses counter-thesis ""trippin"" paid Chinese government

Wow, used appeal stone fallacy traitorous critic fallacy one comment, impressive!

In seriousness, come across someone know jack shit China, Chinese government, Communism. Every Communist movement 20th century - Russian Bolsheviks Convention People's Party Ghana - run Marxists. Marxists believe societies originate Feudalistic, Feudalism causes enough material issues society, transition Capitalism. Eventually, Marxists claim, Capitalism degrade material conditions extent society chooses switch Socialism. Marxist philosophy, process unfold Socialism society become Communist. Every single Communist position power since end 19th century - Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Deng, Ceausescu, Nkrumah, Ho Chi Minh, et al - Marxists trying establish Socialist government bring nations closer Communism long-run.

The existence Chinese government proves China Communist country, Communism simply belief *stateless*, classless, moneyless society. Probably, massive global vaccine shortage, take need? also confessed court never wore mask pandemic. good way get sympathy judge ""officially reported efficacy"" what's ""actually observed efficacy""? [Brazil announced result trial last Fucking hell ridiculous. lucky straightforward birth physically ok except exhausted. 

I cant believe expected look baby that. One HCA's kept saying thinks joke women babies allowed visitors since sick able cope own. Talking brother heart attack allowed visitors were. 

I like baby child every right partner baby's side long want to. know woman gone give birth baby. angry thinking now. 

I've done mask thing too, worry happens. getting used new normal. Yes, talking right early days knew little. made sense assume totally natural origins since was: 1.) obvious tampering 2.) based SARS MERS precedent animal origin 3.) early data led us believe one animal origin well (though previous commenter suggested, mean also lab accident). 

Given evidence seemed likely think pandemic started way pandemics history; via animal human contact. course, scientists job continue collect evidence challenge understanding update conclusions evidence comes out. picture evolved Im totally discounting lab accident theory point. point comment think really important give context thinking way crap scientists immediately knowing answer.

This say also geopolitical motives government said, that's something think want comment without knowing story. comment September 2019 regarding evidence found Italy, different researchers using different methods. right, shouldn’t jsaid “we know”.

And yes, want consider hypotheses find truth. Absolutely. 

Part problem science goes media, it’s like game telephone doesn’t get explained quite right top headline chosen catchy compelling, necessarily Fauci (or whichever scientist quoted) would say accurate. 
And gets read (often headline) people don’t understand run anyway. looks like Germany given vaccine prioritisation free all, survival fittest best connections. Priority group 3 (and even 2) still waiting vaccine, politicians handing vaccine companies talking vaccinating children. Except raw numbers terrible way organising vaccination. idea protect vulnerable, protect employers. Yeah kind weird. parrot hard sound like one guy multiple accounts. 

Personally care keep masks public rest year, vanish tomorrow. obsession.

It kind fun/interesting see freakout though Anyone artificially developed virus would based Italy, seeing we've found several Italians COVID-19 antibodies dating back September 2019, 2 months virus reached Wuhan. motive would exist Italian people Italian government engineer virus? None, almost definitely developed naturally. long age second dose though? know takes week two weeks second dose immunity fully kick in.  China offering Taiwan Fosun-Biontech (which technically exactly widely speculated China pressured Pfizer call / postpone talks Taiwan supplying vaccine back definitely smell hypocrisy China... must be:

1. Trippin
2. China's payroll internet troll We'll see pattern Europe previously seen UK US first doses make decreasing percentage administered doses second doses ramped up. Yes, it’s still relatively new disease don’t know much long term effects. don’t kids, imagine parents would still consider risky catch virus could potentially effect health line. I’m totally happy ditch mask I’m vaccinated, think it’s harder parents. Taiwan would stupid accept low quality China vaccine. mean financial capacity purchase Pfizer Moderna vaccines two companies directly. lot really pessimistic early projectons COVID saw sometimes predicted 2 million dead US June 2020 5 million dead January 2021 Excellent! 5-11!! link support claim. also several links material thread directly disprove claim. There's also politics play there. ""See? bad... start opening now!""  think may follow lead! Yeah, clear, suggesting ask it.

If FDA granted full approval Pfizer/Moderna today, people would still use talking points excuses getting vaccine. really frustrating. study also stated children diagnosed MIS-C showed higher levels alarmins, molecules immune system provide immediate response immunity may active children infected virus,” Carrie Lucas, assistant professor immunobiology Yale University author study, said journal. “But flip side, rare cases may get revved contribute inflammatory disease.” death rate children incredibly low? Like comparably flu low Agreed. Trump loving, anti mask, anti vaxx, COVID-is-a-hoax aunt thinks there's danger had. care less could infect children thinks big deal did. Meanwhile, 75 obese, odds good gets sick. refuses believe facts, says we're foolish living fear. Ugh. 2 weeks vaccination well, we've seen adenovirus vaccines, get better time.

Why still seen studies total efficacy (not severe/critical disease) J&amp;J vaccine two weeks? 

We know improves severe/critical Covid 8 weeks injection still seen anything conclusive total efficacy changes time. value consistency everything else, especially kids. They're able sequence every case, figured outbreak match case quarantined traveler overseas. know yet virus broke quarantine, path took patients know far. Moderna That's quite interesting. Since know anyone ever thought that, would help understand something? numerous samples, would characterize basis belief? 

Are paranoid delusion type (""Aliens beam mind control Wifi"") unintelligent incapable working CV19 would useless weapon kind? possible trolling attention? one one posted cannot find life I'm mad detailed last summer bunch people experts aerosol transmission trying convince actively denied it. totally exaggeration like even little bit ok? It’s funny impactful things happened High School happened everywhere except school class. Classes awful, bullying, teaching lowest common denominator burnt teachers discipline. That’s problem…school actually learning, probably reduced much shorter day actual core academics rest devoted actual “life” skills like socialization, sports, music, clubs, etc. right assure every person best time life high school someone else worst. CDC relaxed recommendations weeks ago. states opening already. Care say ones still want total Lockdown? [What talking Lol. Oops. Sorry typo. 

I’m asking data. That’s impossible. I’m simply stating don’t it. Oh shit? Maybe told everyone take masks. percentage UK vaccinated point? seems like they’re similar position US weeks ago “threat variants” still conversation due plateauing/slight raising cases. even vaccinated enter contest. People j j fully vaccinated two weeks post jab. shit. why, even though I'm vaccinated, taking toddler anywhere anytime soon since CDC lifted mask mandate.  Wonderful news! wonder J&amp;J join party. family hesitant mRNA (I knoww, I'm tryying) gotten J&amp;J adults, still eagerly waiting kids. Fuck win don’t care got free promotion it.  agree. I've first dose currently awaiting second shot.

As someone who's dealt health anxiety since teen, worried. benefits myself, society general, far outweighed apprehension though. really phase 3 trials break things way. 

You could (reasonably?) make assumption Moderna act basically Pfizer (which said full efficacy seven days shot 2), knowing assumption peer-reviewed fact. Personally felt comfortable assumption.

You could also set conservative baseline 80% based [CDC identified efficacy 14+ days first shot either Moderna *or* Pfizer. according people still want us total lock cases hospitalization continue plummet. Sure one highly debated common disorders.

She could arse, psychiatric diagnosis expect we’ll see uptick July august college age students? Maybe? kind “ah shit gotta get done real quick”

I hope so! makes sense younger people vaccine... lazy? We're (California) already seeing walk-in clinics pop-up grocery stores similar, time 'required' incredibly simple obtain. parent 2 year old here, waiting praying 2+ get approved :'( I'm 24. first shot felt nothing except mild soreness arm next day. 

After second shot felt almost nothing 12 hours, suddenly came full body aches, chills, mild nausea full day. Feeling fine now.

Everyone's experience different. teach science set facts believe instead methodology understanding world.

I would satisfied students curious. major problem teaching science set facts replaces human curiosity obedience authority. like say job middle school science teacher get kids forget everything learned get think like four year olds again--the last time probably curious world around them.  Even NY changed regulations camps daycares regard masking public outcry. Also, one NYC health officials who’s one cautious voices saying cases reach 1 per 100,000 NYC (which totally possible ignored) would comfortable making masks optional NYC schools. 

It’s going take time, think gone. serious? 

After time still understand BIG spikes hospitalizations would lead collapse health care system would turn caused immense suffering many times deaths? 

this basis policy decisions. virus killed millions came totally matters. Singapore FINE city probably removed opinion. Talk doctor, probably 90 days. friend arguing last march big deal nothing major needed done around country. screenshot group chat app sayinq 'Even worst case scenario none restrictions 500k people dying average age 80+'. 

That quote aged like milk. Differences would minimal. Don’t know bro it’s racist call lab leak vs saying originated Chinese people love eating bats. Duh! 

When point people like well uhhhhhh. like said, things occur within first two months.

My claim *all side effects* ""most"" them, would occur first two months. Yup also many parents 12-17 year olds last generation still Pox parties. know viruses long term issues shingles. really sucks, hope able get supply soon. first time I've glad United States since pandemic started...fingers crossed get really soon. hope throw book mutineer. actually matter- submit record anytime end June enter...so feel free that! Well considering research also funded America Europe going say no. It’s also heavily brushed rug. think entire point one say chance long term impact. simply don’t data. history safety MRNA research.

I'm asking ""long term"" means. 25 years seem reasonable, two years might. anyone says zero chance long term risk irresistible opinion. thoughts.

Why thank you, I'm flattered!

I think absurd ask 3 years safety data vaccine disease humans ~1.5 years. Australia New Zealand actually 'wait out' Covid's arrival inevitable? Australia particular advantage size Europe major cities hundreds miles away one another.

While vaccinating population, happening rate many rich nations, eventually, pressure going force open again, especially thousands Australian citizens stranded abroad.

Also, non-compliance eventually grow, especially population see's rest first world overcome virus.

I trying downplay efforts, far mostly successful, strategy hermitting entire continent viable long run? long term. policy need exist vaccinate entire population, take years. Super doubt people though article like would meaningless would not? tell still spread covid already think hoax flu care what's point. people think covid hoax, going vaccinated would think. Wasn’t point flattening curve? Spreading inevitable infections didn’t overwhelm hospitals. Yeah since February think policy get everyone vaccinated government. military vaccine distribution facilities even looking appointments anymore. wait line get shot long already system appropriate age. many people refusing get vaccine I'd imagine stocked well want receive it. Actually it’s pretty big Game thrones scenes filmed remember correctly. Study : got vaccine, surprised bland certificates are. counterfeiting features built get together.

Yes, would’ve bit harder expensive make distribution would’ve same... even special paper micro printing would’ve something. I'm 25. first one put ass next day. totally wiped out, felt like got ran truck. second one totally fine, like nothing happened. 

Talking others seems like situation unique usually flip flopped. dad felt great first shot terrible second. Eh, could Narcissistic Personality Disorder Oppositional Defiant Disorder others. vaccines NZ Australia resources pay premium prices huge orders like US/EU/UK.

That's bullshit excuse. Canada similar GDP population 50% population vaccinated one shot already. governments fucked completely vaccine orders, excuse. get mRNA vaccine J&amp;J? I've waiting patiently months heard research happening mRNA followup J&amp;J, discussion whether US' guidance applies J&amp;J vaccinated. lumping ""fully vaccinated"" together J&amp;J lower efficacy? I'm believing (anymore) J&amp;J good, frustrated CDC open clear that. true, data confirm it. followed CDC's recommendation get whatever vaccine available first, really wish could get mRNA, two young children can't get vaccinated yet. leads research here? Thanks. irony calling someone xenophobic thinking it’s less racist believe came people eating bats leaked lab. Either precautions whole lot spread deaths longer period time... Longtime NOVA resident love first sentence, describes us well time HAHA. (Cost living still high get $50/month rent cut COVID lol). yes high % educated people, people general care social issues nice. know anyone friends circle colleagues family vaxxed.  Yeah, I'm seeing *constantly*, tiresome. 

My (least) favorite standard response lately people point relaxing mask mandates puts kids risk, least two three people pop say ""So? Kids stay home vaccinated, then. problem."" 

Like...*come on*. Kids already missed school, social time, camps, year lives. shitty cavalierly say ""Meh, kids sacrifice even adults mildly inconvenienced little longer.""

When become this? 

We society deal much restrictive policies laws protect children (attractive nuisance laws, example). standard response regarding mask wearing suddenly ""Meh, fuck kids."" 

I seriously shocked somebody reply lecture vaccinated adults pose risk dropping mask mandates put kids risk, bla bla bla. *Come on*. know dropping mask mandates means huge swath unvaccinated people longer going wear them, yes, *does* put others risk. live now?  paper estimating 600,000 deaths based taking precautions it. took significant precautions wound 600,000 dead, hindsight estimate extremely low. links claim? Using mobile app? tells problem submit comment, almost always actually create comment. right. I'd survive.  said comment broad policy. seem advocating “merit” based prioritization policy widely regarded unethical arbitrary. don’t know you’re seriously advocating consider “right people” get priority medical care, general policy, it’s ironic complained governor allegedly getting priority, advocating personal preference deserves medical treatment more. good reasons base care medical need, anyone’s idea “deserves” care someone else. Cleanliness public, too.

The weird part seeing over-the-top terrorism PSAs monitors subway cars.

Great place, I'd love live there. time, Brazilian town 98% vaccinated Sinovac, virus virtually worst scenario (do nothing, let run population) saw around 2 million deaths US, taking account virus collapse health system. old news. RemindMe two weeks.  australia living totally normal life 99% aswell? Punish both? would hope crew staff willing participants putting health risk ""coerced"" paycheck.

But think already know answer. really tired natural immunity completely ignored. point much due natural immunity vaccinations. opt using those, EU promises free movement people members many people see forced infringement right. big can't believe Russian spy stupid. Somehow, wonder extra spy pretending Russian. 

Most *Real science bloggers/youtuber.* therefore level ethic.

UK also highest number Indian/Bengali/Pakistani immigrants/population EU.  single example source countries EU ... speculations? retail chain probably last legs anyway. old-school media stores still existence cater vinyl record crowd.  Thank god! We're almost pandemic. scientists offer lab leak possibility, msm social media platforms laugh ban discussion debunked conspiracy theory. Here's article English: kicked ass got rest world. didn’t tell anyone situation hands one government leaked it. Meanwhile, started flying world. Let’s get “china good” drum beat fast either now. I’d say thing England Japan this. Funny kicked ass rest world pummeled virus came country. think it’s locked shit right way free world can’t get away that. seeing rest world suffer medical economical perspectives China rolling ain’t helping fuel conspiracy nutjobs “China bad” mentality. use flip vaccine conspiracy around:

""The Russian government wants believe vaccines dangerous weaken [COUNTRY] population!""

Just make new better conspiracy them. see. Thank heads up. Looking rate vaccination various states... lot 20%. he's actually military? Canadian Forces charge mutiny then? Genuinely asking, I'm confused. Sorry, sound rich. Front line go. 500% number? it’s 100 it’s problem all, it’s 500% increase million is. Perhaps, FDA approved medical applications till now.

Cancer tech trials SARS-COV-1 vaccine starting trials Nov 2019 got co-opted SARS-COV-2.  Even accurate interpretation, giant change tone lab leak unspeakable phrase worthy bans subreddits major news would even allow mentioned.  I'd go whenever.

I root canal entire round antibiotics two shots. know quite random vaccine, long 48 hours think twice. think they're allowing different vaccines simultaneous anyway. Aspirin would one avoid. You’re okay Panadol/Tylenol ibuprofen. Uhhh..... passport provide data? Yes. know. think conclusion potential risk vaccines (where disagree) risks covid infection likely always higher, vaccination still makes sense (where agree). tell vector virus tech new. one approved product -- Ebola vaccine approved 2019.

If anything, potentially higher risk mRNA since altered live virus used. probably best article I’ve read what’s come. much good news part stuck midsummer, communities high vaccination rates, covid-19 starts fade view. places, even people remain unvaccinated protected, little virus circulates. But, parts country, low immunization rates combined reopening allow disease register again. Hospitals aren’t overwhelmed—there’s need build new I.C.U.s call extra staff—but collision ship iceberg forceful, week thousands people fall ill hundreds die. victims vaccine-hesitant; others unable, whatever reason, get vaccinated. Still, perhaps unfairly, outbreaks come aura culpability: people safe parts country, ill seem like smokers get lung cancer.

The summer surge (and even worse winter one) possible areas low vaccination rates.

The country whole kind basking seasonal lull…honestly hadn’t really thought summer surge reading this.

Mid June-early August, last year indication, could quite tragic alarming places, exact time areas higher immunity continue live normal largely COVID free.

Makes frustrating many refusing vaccine. I’m people freedom choose put bodies, wish people knew important particular choice people around them.  Asia actually. I’m worried take meds Panadol seeing cases meds decreased patient’s platelets. 

I’ll definitely go doc nothing changes day. 6mo+ yes trials works.   Total pediatric deaths due flu season one. link weekly updates noted total What’s point getting tested vaccine  able get vaccine slots everyone family (including 18+). Use umang app, get twitter update vaccine slot availablity (I'm sure accounts major cities). need spend couple hours, Log cowin umang app enter first 4 digit city area code, wait twitter notification immediately enter last 2 digit area code hospital vaccine available book( need log cowin every 10 min else time out). Good luck! feel like get downvoted every time say US much wrangling covid control right now. Cases falling. Hospitalizations falling. Deaths falling. Regulations letting up. US seems far ahead everyone else covid endgame once. Wisconsin may reach herd immunity COVID-19 fall vaccination rates continue trend downward, key state health department leader says.

This story seems playing many states. Sadly prolong pandemic. Efficacy use comparing negative control group vax clinical study. It’s 95% efficacy doesn’t mean fails work 5/100. 

Not sure using “effective” here. Yeah absolutely, anything say lab leak. also nothing prove lab leak. Currently scientists saying lab leak lacking transparency outright refuse answer recent news sick lab workers Wuhan. going happen. least two states (AZ TX) vaccine passports preemptively banned Mind dm document wrote explaining long term side effects likely?  republicans anti-vaxxers thankfully. fact would say majority republicans probably aren’t, it’s anti-vaxxers loud. Also, large majority senior citizens taken vaccine, regardless political party. anti-vaxxers I’ve seen actually young adults. anti-vax, think would bit hard time signing baby trial. know betterment humanity must done, that, extremely grateful parents make decision babies test subjects. daughter get vax soon able, something signing trial… Good question--we know years vaccine development (more 100 years, actually!) see potential side effects occur soon vaccination. potential side effects result immune response happens soon vaccination, see new effects many years months later. vaccine ""active ingredient"" speak enters body, immune system recognizes learns (just happens throughout dailiy course life) active ingredient broken gone. Post flaired Europe

Americans: must America. Yes think commenter talking said ""part-time patriots"" ""weekend warriors""? limits individual rights. rights community communal responsibilities.

Idiots right self-destruct. right take others them. 

He took oath, broke it. tried get break theirs. Mutiny. totally right. absolutely would allowed attend rally uniform asked desk job involve vaccine distribution almost certainly would approved. problem calling soldiers refuse mission. looks like all, 10 50% least 1 dose within 28 days 50% fully vaccinated too. I'm almost certain natural. mean made lab, could easily caused horrible conditions animals placed captivity may in. human psychology doesn’t work way don’t time check sources compare others. Russia side multimillion dollar military operations creating stuff. Thanks! Still glowing jab (not literally, lmao). think August I'll 2nd July data show hug precautions. Dad's lots medication best bit careful, least first days I'm them. 

The first visit brother weekend, back place Surrey. works around London work home, give chance try video calling village Lincolnshire. fast enough, move - agree safe enough to. Ty ur service kind sir Oh, shit, like [Civil Air equivalent Canadian military. Lol.

This dude's joke. need wreck he's pretty obviously using uniform political prop order make people think he's big shot military person he's scout leader. Shame him! rando CNN deciding what's critical what's not? I'll definitely notion cover-up due negligence incompetence deliberate development release virus Literally what? Yes, confers immunization. Whether way vaccines question: course differently. think think I'm arguing person learning? 

I not. 

I repeatedly said thread children already asked sacrifice entirely much covid, includes person learning. That's aggravates much see people acting like asking kids sacrifice *more longer* adults wear masks big deal. 

There legitimate reasons put kids back school, including social emotional reasons.

However, again, politicians publicly argued funding schools providing healthcare risk children sound kind bullshitty suddenly act concerned kids education well-being.

Those people arguing bad faith. you. 

If we, country, gotten collective shit together masking, social distancing *brief* periods quarantine, could dealt last summer kids school year. 

I think we're side, here. 

I hope kid/s safe well. Parenting pandemic challenge think us fully prepared for. map difficult look at. also worry they've made higher vaccination states darker color people associate ""worse."" might give anti-vax crowd (unreasonable) incentive refuse vaccination. thought Japan still blocked foreign travel? case? hope you’ll let child get back life normal recover since they’ll antibodies   Odd never worried long term complications vehicle related injuries started. Maybe make learning permanently remote? Australia initially ordered 10 million doses Pfizer immunize front line workers vulnerable long Canada did. relaxed stance since then.

Both countries mad cock first place wait.

The ironic thing active, diverse, highest rated school fared better switching remote work even though ""trips, fun extras"" stuff also stopped vs lowest rated one barely managed one field trip year consisted mostly class class class sitting desk. everyone going agree misinformation everyone going pass law punishes people spread it? don’t “we” ignore misinformation?

Including washing death India, one best friends much extended family, mainly wifes side Goa, another part escapes opposite coast. They've lost 8 far. One death cert. Everyone got sick, 5 able tested. 

The ground far different many narratives posted undrrplaying denying happening. Yeah really. 0 point getting vaccine still gonna get tested, social distance, wear mask etc. Lots brainwashed people sub Exactly. example Moderna initially tried 25ug/100ug/250ug. found later 50ug would worked fine, stayed 100ug want waste weeks.

Either way, drop deaths last weeks **very** encouraging. last week daily average dropped 551 437. There's ban Europeans going US. makes ashamed Canadian. JFC. leaders can't seem lead example save lives - literally. Cool. Nice gaslighting vaccinated people impatient comfortable faces.

The blame stops ends willfully unvaccinated people; vaccinated people petition CDC new guidance plenty us still choosing mask up. downvotes would indicate you’re supposed ask what’s it. That’s fair. parent making choices risk aversions completely right feel way.

You also going explain symptoms like fatigue, headache, lack sense smell included 2.3% (dysopnea seems significant symptom listed study warranting immediate medical care).

China democracy stupid. would risk economy generating discontent ""just sure"". Yeah that’s true, things aren’t much better overall relatively past month so. can’t expect India become country world class infrastructure develop working bureaucracy overnight.

True, political rallies protests, religious gatherings played part second wave coming regardless people given kind social distancing protective measures long second wave Maybe there’s chance eradicate good.

Globally, would say unlikely. 

I expect end like measles circulates poor countries pops back developed countries vaccine coverage lacking. Kuznetsov going nice record reinfection followed breakthrough case, tho, remain immune response. best read lines comes tweets WHO. said accurate time tweeted it. follow tweets expanded meant statement:

""... clear evidence human-to-human transmission novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
However, transmission always concern patients respiratory symptoms - requires investigation.""  sounds like spain France like June 7-9 reached anywhere near herd immunity 

At exact number reach herd immunity? can't base policies nebulous what-if scenarios, need numbers backed data. Several states reached 70% vaccination rates, herd immunity? so, able rescind mask mandates. Unfortunately, that's argument I've seeing lot people make, instead, choose argue vaguer points.

The US going reach herd immunity time states never using exact COVID protocols, expect lifting protocols different?

Also, still unvaccinated people pose threat children 12, even 70% goal reached. Thus, can't make argument based risk unvaccinated pose young children. Instead, deliberate *how much* risk unvaccinated pose based number vaccinated adults compared unvaccinated, again, arguments I'm seeing factor kind risk assessment all.  good! younger sister still isn’t old enough vaccine mild case last November.

Meaning without testing, there's little base 'things much better' on, there? reporting zero cases. fact daily cases reported. example yesterday 19. day 10.

They proactively test quarantine lots people, dozens cases never get chance exponential growth. people disagree lmal parent dealt sick kid, couple weeks illness miserable tolerable. Three months illness would horrific. 1/50 chance negative symptoms lasting longer 3 months totally unacceptable. That's even considering lost school time, physical activity, etc kid would suffer within 12-week window.

Several others can't recall know we're portrayed incorrectly. something legit? so, please share it.  mean, that's surprise. old news every single western vaccine gets lot trolls spreading misinformation it, never seem thing Russia's vaccine. coincidence. ;) showed support Trump bet ass liberals would threw book them. think misspelled ""otter"". ""well goes otter airline.""

It's common saying. would like educated sane discussion go numbers please -

""With odds chances dying COVID receiving vaccine 1 627,329""

\- comparison assumes 101 million people got vaccine exposed COVID, unlikely since vaccine around 5 months so.

So way point time understand true effectiveness vaccine see designed for:

1. According CDC: ""Studies show COVID-19 vaccines effective keeping getting COVID-19. Getting COVID-19 vaccine also help keep getting seriously ill even get COVID-19.""Source: COVID-19 disease developed SARS COV-2 virus.

Source: means try gauge true effectiveness vaccine based data people known contracted virus.

3. ""A total 10,262 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections reported""

These number people known contracted virus vaccination.

4. Case Fatality Rate: ""CFR ratio number deaths divided number confirmed (preferably nucleic acid testing) cases disease. ""

Source: metric determine fatality based number people known contract virus.

5. (Jan 28, 2021) - ""Between first peak mid-April second peak mid-July, case fatality rate United States fell 7.9% 0.7%–2.3% range, since remained despite cases rising (ongoing) third wave:""

Source: CFR 'control' .7-2.3% since vaccine really widely available months back.

6. CFR according breakthrough cases death (if remove 28 people died unrelated symptoms) broken like this:

(160-28)/(10,262-28) = **1.3% CFR.**

The CFR vaccinated individuals fits within .7-2.3% CFR range mostly unvaccinated individuals data Jan.

So someone tell shows vaccine actually working well context? seems like vaccine working good advertised CFR would lot closer 0%, least .7%-2.3% CFR 'control'.

Pfizer - 95%
Moderna - 94%

Both appear practically negligible side effects. Although HSE website mentions ""More 1 10,000 people may develop Bell’s palsy""

BP usually temporary far know


**Other:**

Both 4 week gap second shot

With Pfizer good go week Moderna two weeks after

Happy days

**Indian variant:**

Quote:

The Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna coronavirus vaccines appear protect COVID variants B.1.617 B.1.618 first identified India, researchers reported new pre-print paper, yet peer-reviewed, CNN reported


More good news there

**Miscellaneous:**

Personally we’re avoiding indoor public spaces we’re kids (easier since kids young) hoping get approved vaccine we’re far school year. ...on paper are. least SoCal, outside large chains, over. Meanwhile Florida, employers threatening fire staff get vaccine. Even people Trump right, coming racist angle. following science anything back then.

Now making things wholesale.

I think issue basing everything posting based one Fauci quote. I’m basing I’m saying based everything saying lately everything said year ago along scientists saying. 

I think motivations aren’t based good faith disagreement, I’m going engage further. virus allowed run willy nilly around world, time talk countries getting shit together. contained. flown world.  based history, cause lab outbreaks common lab leak theory proves true, likely scenario accidental. could potentially lead worldwide change research infectious diseases. one stopping discussion. need clear language.

Theres something wrong active cases metric. look chart, never gone down, straight line 1.6 million months. “they?” I’m pro-vaxx Democratic Biden voter (hope doesn’t get removed politics) saying months haven’t proper investigation rule lab leak. I’ve never invested conspiracy theory know before.

And yet I’ve called many names saying need investigation topic people assume must coming opposite political tribe. fact acting like parents gives hope think maximalist interpretation/possibility accidental release, authorities realized happened eradicate quickly without country suffering, decided let spread/actively spread rest world locking country idea nothing gain ""fixing"" problem letting rest world skate, lot gain inflicting economic pain rest world first re-open--which exactly happened, China surged ahead economically everyone else withered.

To clear, I'm saying happened. saying possibility would match China's pragmatic way ruling. Fauci “no longer saying” 50 million things also, answers one specific question. 

He said convinced, answer question “Are convinced...”. true. asked question year ago would said thing - weight word scientist. Instead back show evidence had. 

 saying need investigate more. true. also said before. 

You concluding *change* opposed specific answer specific question wasn’t asked before. 

And incidentally also listening discredited reporter clearly stated “don’t believe everything read”. 

If Fauci (or scientist) clarified position changed, would unhappy least. 

I however unhappy comments get taken context topic goes viral good reason. 

I argue believe right, yes. 

I’m done though. truth come out. DMV represent! Wearing mask helpful dealing hay fever. (Not sarcastic, can.) probably vasovagal syncope, it’s super rare condition. It’s good know warn doctors get needles. terminology poisoned enough worth using. Nobody thread suggested know one way other. We're waiting vaccinating kids vaccines approved yet. vaccines India would better nothing. like going back time: remember march 2020? idea do. bought cloth masks, useless real masks disappeared . good mask could've saved lives 

now vaccines: work MUST available everybody. see instead? countries problem spending millions buy arms can't find way buy dose 6USD save people? start giving newborns guarantee brought subject real-life friends, would get exact reaction.

When first broke out, remember making one negative comment Chinese Communist Party friend, chastised racism. criticism governmental policy nothing race average Chinese citizen. Send 30 million fosun vaccines EU get 20 million Pfizer-Biontech back. Nice good. would Authoritarian Communist ethnostate create virus nearly exclusively effects elderly, obese, immunocompromised (aka non-producers)?

Hmmmmmmm.... would China that?

Have communist countries ever culled population before? dogma vocabulary actually. 

If say plane pilot, they're really likely think wings. say carpenter, they're likely think tool. 

A similar thing happened physicists medical sciences. Airborne physical science occurs across gradient curve particle size shapes. Airborne Doctor means particular particle size near binary size. 

Great Wired articles regarding it. [first] near beginning. [second] follows mistake written stone fainted 15 hours second Moderna shot. Felt better hour back normal 3 days. edge case, worth would again. Hope get well soon.  outside only... bit ridiculous virus originated China shuts whole world, discussions happened China. come from, much government know, know it, honest rest world, etc. It’s unfortunate stirs anti-Asian violence small minority people, that’s reason stop discussion. bad Caps make past first round..I looking forward full capacity indoor stadiums next round DC. 😑 got Moderna shot felt slightly tired day second dose. Also, arm hurt.

Nothing bad. relaxed day enjoyed it. Feeling little drowsy bad know sick. Please get tested peace mind. possibly health. need make competition title, old fashioned state rivalry person feeling weather possibly symptomatic. Pfizer want best vaccine protection. J &amp; J care g less effective vaccine want check ""fully vaccinated"". Nice Hitchens quote. 

Did ever read Hitchens said authoritarian hell holes like China? think long still get amount contact time, okay. say may told watch video lecture beforehand come class knowing stuff. They've talking reverse classroom years. stopped favorite grocery store today. mask reminder sign gone, replaced one said “Employees without masks provided proof vaccination.” take mask pocket, really enjoyed drinking soda shopping, frankly, missed. ? I'm really hoping drop summer camp mask requirements kids' sakes! think Japanese people generally liked Trump, fair really see much relevant things like opinion China. mind restrictions introvert mental health probably improved. absolutely despised online learning. attendance work ethic completely disappeared, despite usually extremely hard-working.  Crazy vaccinated go back office ones don’t give crap refuse get stay home- crazy- better believe booster time comes around next shot I’m saying I’m getting it( even though will) stay home longer hour commute way- shitty companies working Never ask someone vegan... they’ll always tell you. Never fails! That’s including everyone got cancer later say hilarious. like sickening, deceitful. Exactly.

China even let see Wuhan lab year. They're trying sound relevant.

The whole world produced enough vaccines fully vaccinate everyone India. People forget big suffering countries are. vaccines spread evenly across whole world, would barely made dent. Okay respond source one well known virologists world quoted saying “I change view” people get covid don’t die. majority elderly who, going reproduce, already done so. native English speaker? degree? Ok move Japan really want teacher. Yeah, I'm even talking many directly make livelihoods tourism, I'm sure either way there's sector want tourists. guess depends higher dose means nanoparticles not. understanding encapsulation step big bottleneck. censorship social media issue hilarious guise ""misinformation"". work, everyone straw manned anyone questioning origin crazies think virus genetically created unleashed purpose. January, would chuckled sign gone anyway. Even now, it’s “masks required,” without “wit,” I’m fine that. particular one would annoyed well. dont see not. US 1 million second doses day right now, needs 20 million second doses reach 20 million fully vaccinated end June. would 560,000 per day.

First doses given per day also pi key bit last several days opening kids age 12 above. prop 2nd dose rate couple weeks kids need second doses. I'd expecting 160 million fully vaccinated end July. 

It long struggle get sizeable percentage rest population vaccinated, though. Apart age 12-17 kids, US running people enthusiastic vaccines yet gotten theirs.  everyone looking big picture. largely based comments HI news posts though, probably getting realistic opinions.  survive live reproduce. Kids get sick enough COVID let alone die sizable impact population. Yeah that's exact right approach. least give everyone chance get fully vaccinated open completely. completely agree culture need discussion public health messaging science/health media coverage. *astounding* amount misinformation there, see people aren’t scientifically literate could fall bunch it. even wackadoodle anti-vax stuff, things like thinking still spread Covid vaccination, somebody CDC said instead saying didn’t know sure yet. (Even though I’d following experts said equivalent “it would super weird didn’t prevent spread.” thinking masks work better vaccines, on. Communication fails around, actually look studies read find good information. Maybe open give vaccinations then. I've seen that's bottle neck, doctors allowed (I think) course it’s low considering UK vaccination going pretty well events major concerns safety bit much.

We imagine running events without restrictions would much worse.  genome virus look like came natural evolution. came existence already infectivity never seen nature Even though longer mask requirements campus work on, new recommendation vaccinated people need mask, nearly 100% people still masking inside.

I'm vaccinated longer wear mask honestly feels weird person 20 room without one. doubt people unvaccinated given ease availability here. (Florida)

Got feeling things us quite time inertia. context that? rest conversation? Lol still don’t, many ways. horribly frustrating battle seeing aerosol scientists trying change literature policy west regarding airborne spread Covid. I'm requiring proof vaccination indoor gatherings, needs forethought deal people can't get vaccine legitimate medical reasons, documented adverse reaction 1st dose prevents getting 2nd dose.

As healthy 31 year-old eagerly awaiting 2nd Pfizer dose return normalcy, hospitalized blood clots day 2nd dose (pulmonary embolism - still scary, rare cerebral clotting disorder Janssen vaccine - thank goodness) despite risk factors family history, I'm dreading conversation medical history treated like anti-vaxxer participate normal life places requiring proof vaccination. Obviously correlation equal causation, still recommend everyone get vaccine despite experience, doctor advising getting 2nd dose timing coincidental ignore, 2nd dose could life-threatening indeed source unprecedented blood clotting episode.

Unfortunately, seem way reasonably prove I'm one actual cases serious adverse event wanted get 2nd dose, legitimately can't 1st one potentially gave life-threatening blood clots. fully understand doctor's notes can't trusted b.s. ""I can't wear mask"" cards people trying use, really needs way unfortunate souls right thing, got first dose, get 2nd one they're 1 however many legitimate medical emergency doses could potentially triggered vaccine. Funny it? entire year normies media overlords censored debate issue. ""What asserted without evidence dismissed without evidence""

China North Korea. nowhere near comparable difficulty data collection. Furthermore, there's nothing unrealistic China's claim considering response lack tests proper testing methodology. Fact China reacted fast effective measures. otherwise, facts backing instead sarcasm. 

Anyway, done discussing clearly nothing offer realm worthwhile information. 100% true developed biological weapon, I’d like war. don’t see excuse. China would caught lying world weapon developed secret intent cause harm, doesn’t matter accident got released not. pandemic nearing end main course high vaccination countries. Vaccines get job done. we'll past point prompt overwhelm medical system cause mass fatalities. people susceptible, least significant illness.

*However...*

A level annual circulation comparable seasonal flu acceptable. Besides future waves would alongside returned flu, COVID far deadlier flu. would remain problem areas without high vaccination rates. sharp threat, without strong, practical treatment, still deadly one. 

The big difference unlike seasonal flu vaccines, COVID vaccines strong enough suppress disease own. long continue work / updated timely. 90%+ effective flu vaccine flu season.  It’s really useless biological weapon believe society far capable mitigating spread enemies. really believe way anyone intentionally released Covid certainly changed viewpoint utility intentional release considered more. I'm fairly sure moderna currently trials reduce amount RNA vaccines. get yo 30mg like Pfizer, could presumably sell 3x many vaccine doses existing RNA production infrastructure. would mean price competitive Pfizer per dose, potentially get orders developing nations got vaccines far. Making things up? leave NYT?

All Fauci’s statements here. go all. says almost nothing origins, does, states facts, calls investigation. read yourself. point I'm inclined follow [xkcd's try eradicate virus purely spite It’s like asking Spain buy vaccines Hispanic distributor based Mexico, mind-boggling It’s free, can’t hurt. Schedule next day anyway, use excuse eat snacks watch TV. signed told age group opened received email 3 days later appointment next week. 13 year old getting first shot next week. don’t really think it’s bad. Hilarious seeing idoits swallowed notion possibly lab leak mental gymnastics avoid wrong. Hard reach. Rural America 30 miles homes self sufficient communities. really hope changes too, sounds like they’re fully sticking plans I’ve seen heard 😕 posted elsewhere myself. It’s change anyone’s opinion, they’ve always insisted research. 

The lead scientist said “ particularly comment “Anybody who’s making statements high level certainty outstripping what’s possible available evidence” me, it’s vaccination rate alone matters. Case counts area still prior beginning third wave last November, despite vaccination rate age 12+ 70% least one shot county. chief public health officer said universal masking needs continue rates come (his expectation that’s weeks away).

Not everyone fortunate enough live virus plummeting, even US; us watching slowly crawl downwards even plateau. maybe Wizards Maybe employees vaccinated yet. 

A number people unmask feel like it, even without vaccinated. might protecting workers. They're either ill informed overdoing it. Hell even unvaccinated pretty low risk outside. used wear mine shots figured necessary anymore outside save large crowds. animal sick market, probably looked healthy/the best option eat could remained days, possibly infecting animals could pushed variety others took home well. mean, even US, could focusing best achieve herd immunity, booster dose research progress, international cooperation help poorer countries get vaccines etc. matter country is, benefit focus getting shots many people possible. One mutation escapes vaccines would set lot things back. Well mine 10, he's still 100% virtual (he likes it). can't imagine hard must parents daycare age kids!

Everything shut like month 3rd birthday. lucky got birthday party. Sigh. isn’t bold claim. search lab leak theory read articles major publications.

New information changed discussion around origin virus.

If you’d actually read article, you’d see completely fair summary discussion changed links sources. It’s getting summertime, know outdoor transmission almost never happens, so, me, sounds like summer going beach, lake, park, barbecues, etc. Plan outdoor fun 12 vaccine approved. J&amp;J, get one shot. Wow. That's incredible. They're getting numbers low enough even schools could mask free.  reenterring daycare. already cold week. COVID though. Get ready cold.

I’m worried getting croup ear infection COVID, personally. 2. Older kids don’t get much. think objectively investigating origin virus racist, unless known without doubt lab theory impossible infeasible (in case would agree would racist). expert seems accidental leak could possible.

I think important find origin vaccine safeties place future closing wet markets came from. think done objectively without placing blame Chinese people. fact, SARS 2 genome specifically lacks characteristics genetically engineered, ""manufactured"". That's part theory initially pushed aside favor natural origins theory, precedent SARS 1 MERS back up. Excellent comment man. I've watching stupid graph months hate that. North Korea doesn’t cases. source: North Korea. 

Case closed! can’t argue otherwise don’t eViDeNcE. think measles change variants? Yes, consensus changed - isn’t consensus more.

Last year consensus evidence consistent natural jump. That’s true—if you’re place that’s hard-hit like India, pressing issues right now. you’re place like US COVID winding down, resources investigation. Well, that's frankly problem. can't argue based nonexistent foundation. ""they might lying"" sole argument can't engaged past shrug ""idunno, maybe"" unless actual decent evidence provided.

So far provided leaked documents CCP, I'd say good gets figuring really happened situation like this. seen anything convincing opposite direction.
This means I'll conclude based available evidence likely, nothing paticularly malicious occured.  even college kids. finished first year college friends hated remote learning. *Hated* it. Sucks even we’re paying thousands dollars half ass education. Thank god normal school resuming next fall would never remote learning thing ever again. 

Remote learning works people *want* remote learning. older student doesn’t equal “They’re supposed self disciplined they’ll fine.” way. We’re still students deserve high quality education too. AFAIK Hungary. Malta already fairly small easy greatly increase share. Denmark also picked lot extra, enough much huge impact. frustrating happens. scientist, problem often run public dissemination info conveying message effectively enough spur response also entirely accurate, least extent possible. course, uncertainty always exists even face available data, always add caveat, bites scientists ass often. almost encourages white lies, invariably damage good end. know talking reddit headline, talking article headline read article then...it's headline says (to bait clicks) children particular risk, least comparison flu. they're reason undertook NPIs have. (Taiwan) get vaccines, playing politics now. 

Foshun distribution partner Pfizer greater China region (HKG, Macau, China Taiwan) gladly supply Pfizer's vaccine Taiwan Taiwan want buy them. 

Well want get Pfizer distributor area, sure expect refer lab leak theory, mean potential scenarios 1-3, yet I’ve called conspiracy theorist many times. I’ve never suggested China maliciously created released virus.

There many people like me, including forum, shut line over. Even former CDC Director former Secretary State called conspiracy theorists.

I’m sure people believe China deliberately released deadly virus. painted majority people questions theory? repeatedly refer “stopping discussion” said it’s important discuss right we’re still dealing pandemic.

Fair enough. stand it. number people personally know passed away covid went 1 13 last 3 weeks. People begging vaccines hospital beds. dont care started now. one investigates started fire building literally burning saying. anti- investigation. there’s difference baseless speculation asking questions. lot valid questions ask lab leak theory.
True. long questions legit ""Asking questions"" like Tucker Carlson. parent 1 2 high school kids, remote amazing us. junior managed attend classes year long without feeling like outcast due constant medical issues. Usually 504 place supplement school misses home teachers, it’s bad. year, high honor roll year he’s actually getting assignments time. 

My freshman, she’s done great too. She’s made honor roll every quarter. teachers great helping needs it. feels personal she’s able communicate better teachers. 

If don’t offer remote option next year it’s going stink kids. realize kids don’t well like this. Mine however do, desperately hope it’s option them. Also public declaration changed viewpoint. quotes Prof Ian Lipkin told former

They seem good source global information every move good one, they’ve stewarded global view COVID pretty well systemic perspective. 

Please let us know don’t believe anything say. Go ahead.  Case numbers misleading too. valuable deaths hospitalizations. know people got sick (most likely Covid) never got tested. Ayyyyy, science says nearly children recover fully 6 Wow little patronizing.... Yup. answer. Wanting Vaccinated, healthy, younger person mask shelter place every person possible get vaccine whether they're high risk crazy pants. Yes downvote oblivion stating big concern lot americans worried about. There's plenty criticize without making shit up. Also, important get facts straight criticizing.

The doctor question, Li Wenliang, ""alert world"" (he actually sent messages private chat group specifically asked members share information outside group) ""imprisoned"" (he actually warned police spreading false rumors confirmed SARS cases).

Most importantly discussion, clearly result local authorities trying suppress panic cover arses, grand scheme Chinese state cover outbreak. weeks Li interrogated, local officials dismissed, Li ""rumor-mongers"" publicly exonerated supreme court China.

What really criticized system causes local officials sycophants whose first instinct hush things cover arses rather right thing public good. don’t believe anything says covid. respond family saying they’re gonna wait get vaccine? really spread falsehood rand paul pushing getting virus makes immune evidence makes immune way vaccines do. scientific evidence back spreading misinformation got hole first place. So, new excuse people wanting everyone wear masks children fully recover? weird Wuhan Institute Virology took pages bat coronavirus ""research progress"" page. Someone please correct I'm wrong, find today. Yeah, actually makes sense Definitely not.

I resent most, outside stuff super close second. 

To OP....if bio-weapon literally fuck ever, I'm much happier I've fully vaccinated 2 days now, well past second jab woot. well hope Argentina start manufacturing... reading good news Sputnik V.

edit: found India starting manufacturing Sputnik V. fair, likely vaccine causes less myocarditis (if fact cause it) covid infection does.  imo country several times survive catastrophical natural disasters handle pandemic situation.

Dont underestimated Japan Japaneses society. No. It’s exactly same. likely animal reservoir found keep investigating. That’s scientific method.

But it’s unlikely. Saying unlikely theory likely still wrong. Pay like America did.

Mine week half past second dose! stupidly annoying. Even meet **herd immunity threshold** something eradicated, still ton value **partial herd immunity,** akin accomplish influenza vaccines.

We forget it, understand means. don’t know, I’m disagreeing. saw news articles that’s could think may referring to. Huh? Pretty much every state rolling back restrictions right  AZ made India called covidshield. even different name!  NYC dropped mask mandates indoors week so. I've Target Trader Joe's I'M STILL PERSON who's wearing mask. like outcast feel like people judging me, time think I'm wrong. Anyone else feel same? Cutting China would hurt world's economy covid ever could pretend thats we're heading lmao Exactly, it’s par Pfizer best vaccine world general lot better AZ.

Pfizer German vaccine lot use outside US, lot studies associated Serial interval number days transmissions. Say ALWAYS exactly 4 days, R(t)=2 every 4 days cases would double. Every week, they'd rise 2^7/4 = +236%. want reverse it, since cases dropping weekly 76% previous value, R(t) = 0.76^4/7 = 0.855.

But value 4 come from? 3.5, 5, 8 instead? math completely changes. weekly change known value (though smoothed since cases coming certain days lagging behind infections). serial interval really known, can't ""really"" know R(t) either. makes calculations like herd immunity threshold difficult. complicated model come ways; instance B.1.1.7 fixed amount contagious B.1 adjust serial interval amount across R(t) values found different countries.

And actually far complicated that. There's reason believe serial interval even constant - could vary greatly depending many people get sick leave, instance. course single value all, distribution time. combined effect distribution taking algebraic average - like solving Fibonacci series.

The actual number 3.96 quoted comes [this Canada bring military provinces help long term care homes. Elders died dehydration soiled, hyperbole. 
There's firing employees there's one replace them. addition, Pfizer vaccine German used lot outside US major world studies.

Aerosol smaller lingers air minutes coughing spread 10-20ft. (Common cold like this) really surprising bit long tail this. Vaccines slowing down, restrictions lifting, people loosening up, etc. even decreasing vax numbers, still several things keep putting downward pressure numbers. Still lot people getting vaccinated, still lot people full immunity (2 weeks post-2nd shot) soon, kids getting vaccinated, unvaccinated catching getting immunity way.

Seems like raise transmission opening lifting mandates, think OK long increase spread much.

Seems like lower transmission continuing vaccination, lot protection already built curve.

Appreciate well thought post. say, ""The actual R(t) depends serial interval transmissions guessed (the CDC study shows algebraic average 3.96, instance"" - mean?

It's one bizarre things idiots love circle-jerk even though total non-issue. Interesting point. people don’t try understand expert’s logic. see expert said “good/bad.” appeal authority.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Holy crap, knew church looked familiar... Let's change topic drunken town world's largest 6 pack beers. 0.215 doses per person administered, 0.0868 last month. Assuming get 1 end pandemic (a little US currently is, UK weaker vaccines B.1.617.2 cases still rising dramatically) would take 9.04 months.

This obviously makes incorrect assumption doses scale up, less ignores vaccines dramatically different efficacies (although absurdly good compared source, information validity of, projects 14 billion doses currently approved vaccines end 2021, would meet goal. 22 billion doses vaccines (including approved yet anywhere).

Overall seems really hard project. Summer 2022 seems conservative (aka safe bet) though. Sars basically stopped airport. never became problem West hope/assumption would go away well....

There first hand experience need caution HELL want say now? let unvaccinated go whatever want?**

Why would need stop unvaccinated want want spread please think!!!!

Please assume I'm thinking this. Lockdowns vaccination extremely important getting levels disease down, idea vaccination passports one that's practical, necessary fair UK. I'm asking interesting get another viewpoint this, really addressing questions I'm asking. Gee, examples hell breaking loose found. hey, said true guess makes true. Doubly cursed!   Thank sharing this. good important information share  wear masks, bit uncomfortable okay

Having 5 visitors home day annoying huge restriction compared past,

30 people public,

people still meet bars/restraunts, weddings continue Americans ones: two basic things would make aus perfect improved hotel quaratine dedicated places adequate ventalation etx., 

so could allow everyone wants come home get back,

and allow people leave. Doses two different vaccines untested believed effective. Given inconsistent supply much world probably going happen lot. Overall best recommendation get first dose whatever vaccine first available asap.

I aware currently distributed vaccines target strain besides original one, though. sure saying? Gated institutional narrative  Haha, literally did. lot fucking businesses idea go masks required masks required, verify vax status, passports, employees can't police this, OSHA say, etc. mention state health agencies screwed messaging compounded issue.

Hell, I'm happy vaccines working. science great. policy communication? Confusing leaving little room transition time population, businesses, organizations, etc. adapt comfortably. know!  

The thing say it’s acceptable hypothesis. Let chips fall may.  Investigate see disapprove lab leak hypothesis. Let’s see prove wet market Hypothesis.   

Let’s dismiss reasonable hypothesis fits somebody’s institutional narrative.  

Maybe feelings everybody sneezing coughing 2019 whatever.  know don’t know much.  

All I’m saying want find answer throw things bigwigs TV say it’s extremely unlikely - that’s example science gone bad sympathetic possibility lab leak theory obviously pushed US intelligence agencies.

It really mean much, reverse argument authority. Discredit something authority said so. line thinking got us antivaxxers begin with, keen that.

On hand, yes, due deals made, USA already declared silent cold war China. best interest stain China's image, COVID lab specially Xinjiang topics habe literally weaponized, China's attitude towards things help. One important things right side get ahold TSMC industry Taiwan.

So, let's go, another 80 years wars, artificial toxic nationalism serves rich artificially slowed progress. measures normally take 10 days effect.

Due incubation period etc.  Sure, lot people died

Grandma died go back Hooters.

I disagree anything said whole statement kind morbid... ""They're safe lot people dead.""  bit surprising given [none Phase 3 trial data Sinovac appears published Also many Phase 3 trials use shot booster pair separated *14 days*, 4+ weeks studied vaccines. Mate. want get them. Trust me. 

You go via GP unless near hub. even then, open 40's. Anyone 40 can't go anyone 40-49 accept risks AZ. 

Our government has, true form, fucked rollout. GPs getting 30 doses week waiting list 1000 patients. Others getting 100 doses enough patients. 

It's another screwup Scotty probably go unnoticed given apathetic voting populace is. Pottery?  T-shirt time man Luke OG.  quickly moved goalposts unable get vaccinated 'may work fully.' also pointing energy people getting vaccinated instead stranger vaccinated. You’ve (we have) given permission think walking 5G hotspot sure convenient past weeks. Yeah maybe it’s amazing became PhD‘s virology really amazing existing epidemiologists medical doctors PhD‘s virology decided dismiss lab leak hypothesis decided whole bunch stupid ass things armchair quarterbacks figured thinking freely it.  

To that’s amazing Sure, certified point normalize it'll okay unmasked. However, understand courtesy. continue mask required despise people throw tantrums. 

To fair longer mask outside, science positive whether vaccinated, not, low risk transmission. hopefully help people comfortable outside masklessness soon. DMV also one highly educated populations per capita US. Hmmm... I'm you. Vaccinated people risk non-vaccinated people. thing would add numbers far small interpret meaningful way. example, two adverse events occurred within J&amp;J ...you mean two three women received vaccine became pregnant, 66% chance adverse effects? numbers orders magnitude small determine kind causal link here.

Very good point. agree, numbers small determine minimum ages included studies? main point, effects children tested yet we're advocating en masse vaccination children short period time.

Seems Moderna 18 (page 20 document previous comment), Pfizer 16 (page 20), J&amp;J 18 (page 21).

It seems lot data currently infants young children, however Pfizer phase 3 trial participants aged 12-15, 2,260 total participants. [They say side effects consistent age 16+. also still two month follow-up participants, however seems monitored half participants two month period instead participants. 2,260 people included study, versus 43,651 total 16+ Make information will. I'm teen I'm knowledgeable enough speak much it.

Moderna also stated [press release initial analysis trial aged 12-17, vaccine showed 96% efficacy safety concerns identified date. 3,235 people enrolled trial, median safety follow-up 35 hear Pfizer started phase 2 3 trial ages six months 11 years old, however find direct statement Pfizer believe they've released information trials yet. may still monitoring participants right administered doses already. 

I believe US still monitoring children aged 12-15 gotten Pfizer vaccine safety, seen major issues propping yet. speak precise monitoring systems are, government able detect blood clotting issue affected 6 people J&amp;J vaccine, put hold vaccine found way identify treat it, assume issues would detected already. Seems safety monitoring systems quite precise detect 6 several million occurrence (I'm sure exactly many people got J&amp;J vaccine detected cases). think people would care appeal protect children already vaccinated? person wearing mask threat kids. Point angst pity douchebags actually problem. think heard thing - perhaps something virus jumping animal species humans easily, quickly. don’t know sure, I’d suggest research find Probably 30 minutes search YouTube.  FYI interview Media last weekend researcher mentioned ""live"" animals market frogs non-COVID-carrying small animals. live animals market cable carrying transmitting type corona virus, recent days/weeks.

The animals market COVID19 humans. arguing lab leak virus made synthetically ground up? article 3 paragraphs clear.

If virus isolated bats cave brought lab infects researcher due poor lab technique, virus longer natural origin? I'm wondering point virus becomes ""not natural origin"" conspiracy theories scientists saying baseless.  surprising considering prevalent traditional medicine. Drinking milk? Yeah, real knee slapper! Imagine: grief, suffering, anguish millions Americans people world.. hoax! Can't wait Fauci hit us ""It's prank, bro!"" adds nothing useful resource bring outside actual argumentation, since clears ""USA good, China bad"" stigma, humble people right away. opinion surprisingly helpful bring everyone level present objective arguments. guess they'd need prove still qualify. window athletes pretty small. 2 years lifetime lot events.  correct!   Cum hoc ergo propter hoc. gets tiring explain every ... Chinese allowing examine year

Citation required. Exactly!  pretty much forbidden suggest “lab leak hypothesis” - anyone talk cite experts dismissed it! 

I hope people check Bret Weinstein - biologist, makes really compelling points need us properly investigate lab leak hypothesis.  conclusions made - says let’s look - without “cancelled” called nutbar.

I hope people look see society gets manipulated. Husbandry. course would you....

Guess happened uk, never heard it. specifically said wanted inform people personal risk individual level. question actually needs masked isn’t call, local leaders businesses. 

And big hole “there’s risk me, I’m vaccinated, never need wear masks” idea CDC still requiring EVERYONE wear masks mass transit, schools, prisons, hospitals. 

So basically, no, cdc saying you’re done masks. said you’re safe, still may need to. saying New York lifting restrictions soon CDC issued new guidance sign want see people die? really going this?  Might going September!   Wuhan one biggest cities world. need one person Wuhan travel Yunnan, bring home virus, spread others asymptomatically via public transit, indoor dining, etc. You’re infectious immediately infection, there’s time return Wuhan without infecting anyone, especially driving private vehicle. Full contact tracing would impossible many cases lockdowns. cdc flat said, vaccinated, need wear mask. Obviously local state government. didn’t caveat anything checking vaccine cards horse shit made up. 

They cited studies Israel basically concluded vaccinated people become sick symptomatic asymptomatic covid. much thread spread disease. concluded vaccinated people need wear masks. That’s indiana. one world's respected medical journals bat eye publishing it. wonder trust science eroding.  You’re anything wrong. Masking 100% personal choice now. people others, it’ll take time adjust. Last year (and still now) people literally claiming proof lab leak.

My arm sore day first shot could barely lift high enough make ninety-degree angle arm pit, gradually got better couple days, slept day after. second shot arm sore, nearly bad first one. yeah funny theory fucking ridiculous months soon Fauci makes one comment, suddenly entirely plausible. I've confessed times I'm fence origin I've laughed sub every occasion. Masks restrictions got brought back FIVE cases. 

That’s crazy compares US. appeal authority.

As side note, thats fallacious here. Appeal authority really fallacious outside authorities area expertise (ignoring cherry picking).

LSV says buy silver, well aint area expertise fallacious. Good point! got second shot April 1st I'm ready burn mask remember statement applies globally. Mutations happening Brazil, India, elsewhere affect us all.

With said, I’m Texas, 15-year-old got first dose 9 Thursday morning day CDC approved it.

We need crank many doses help get surplus doses anybody anywhere world accept them. there’s fewer vaccinations weekend... bring perspective Reddit someone trying low-key racist /s. buddy mine Philippines messaged today catch up. said girlfriend got vaccination site today 5am stand line get first shot. even get health issues. thankful got chronic health conditions risk covid. They've lockdown tiny apartment year.

Contrast half family can't bothered mask get vaccine fact actively criticize people do. maddening. doesn’t seem like “lab leak” theory likely

it certainly first time. think Chinese labs leaked viruses 3 times recent past. uniquely Chinese problem. chiropractor really helped lot. don’t think it’s junk science all. I’m sure it’s everyone, many works really well. ""It winter, time put masks again!""

Yeah, fuck right know animal populations around wet market tested? safe assume spill occur, would larger population animals hosting breeding virus. Right? anthrax letters 9/11 contained virus US-american lab. went weeks, hours news genetic analysis origin, … nothing.

Drop da bomb? time winter wave comes around, I'm sure kids vaccinated. not, hopefully enough 12+ area vaxxed mostly stop spread. many people vaxxed stop wave, bad news, like morons going willingly put mask instead lie vaccination status. point best keep kids harm's way wave gets bad. Manaos...The Hands Fate here....we...go. America? conflated therefore involved creating virus ridiculous majestic leap I've ever heard of.

So answer question, no. lot people's two weeks second shot yet, especially 4 weeks shots. I'm looking forward going around mask free next week :) Also hard get truth country lies constantly.

I wish look suit propaganda better sweep carpet usual.

Yes, course natural immunity counts well. know much counts. 25 probably matter, 65 seems like dumb risk. don’t understand reddit gets hard-on scientists. Maybe went grad school would see flawed corrupt academia be.

Despite this, China since increased bio lab count *in response to* COVID many proponents controversial research using Covid beg even funding expanded projects. 

If lab leak proven such, would provide political pressure needed shut much risky research quite possibly prevent next even next several pandemics (saving millions lives process.) 

This course perspective someone thinks type work going labs worth risk humanity. people argue performing work would lead pandemics- it’s controversial topic. know what’s good goalpost? pandemic.

Now .... bam. 
Fauci changed mind many times isn’t funny. It’s small piece larger picture. pieces add warrant masking another months we’ve reached 70-80% vaccinated commonly suggested, around sept kids vaccinated? think does.

I’d save 100 kids could end many die. I’d save tens thousands adults. save everyone higher insurance premiums higher taxes Medicare paying hospitalizations. risking mutations could evade vaccines. Bulgaria extreme vaccine hesitancy, outright antivax.. thought US plateaued early, compare 11%. saw one poll said something like 50% Bulgarians think Covid hoax way governments exert control.

Right now, China global factory world. Cutting China akin shooting foot ; devastate economies, already precarious position given Pandemic.

But revelation seriously hurt China's future plans, allies turning it. make countries wary Chinese investments, neutral observers might start taking sides. Domestic opinion current CCP leadership might change, fuelled fact Xi Jinping still detractors party purge. downplay inequity aspect, real id wager 100% approved vaccines use created 10 countries. makes sense vaccinate first. metallic taste first pfizer. people know severe side effects (flu-like) usually moderna everyone either group felt crummy next day fine following that. nothing I’m talking about. far determined. However, true Texas would lot worse right are.

So pretty much deduce natural immunity counts toward goal well. Asia late covid vaccinations agree. It’s also incorrect insinuate unknown warrants mask mandates restrictions. also irrational believe, without evidence, developed naturally. Either way picking conclusion want based zero available evidence.

Almost 62 percent residents country vaccinated two doses vaccine total 70 percent. least one dose. numbers, Seychelles, island nation Indian Ocean popular tourist destination, become world leader vaccination SARS-CoV-2 . respect, ahead three countries list: Israel, Great Britain United Arab Emirates. 
There two sources success. First all, Seychelles managed obtain Chinese vaccine Sinopharm preparation AstraZeneca, produced India name Covishield. Secondly, operation easier carry population paradise islands less 99,000. comparison: average daily number vaccinations covid-19 last seven days Poland approx. 300 thousand. daily. third infected vaccinated.

What said, message cited, implies limited time investigate, would allowed investigate issue year.

Should year, Chinese government allowing examine?

Well, that's say that.

On another topic, lab hypothesis still little evidence supporting still say hypothesis. course hard pinpoint origin, SARS2 RNA almost 90% identical RNA bat coronaviruses.

Considering safety measures place biological lab considering safety measures humans interacting wildlife... I'm putting bets lab thing. infected bats asymptomatic since virus really affect them. look sick, people think they're sick handling them.

That's bring fallacy.

The fact Wuhan lab researches coronaviruses piece evidence means adds conversation absolutely nothing. Unless want start blaming higher incidence cancer people living near telecommunication towers compared towers think valid argument.

A concern valid enough prompt investigation one took place, nearly enough make energetic assertion. got update. Japan currently doesn’t recognize vaccine status. Foreigners entering country must take PCR test 72 hours advance quarantine two weeks 274 cases day 2.3%test positive rate really hit hard. Yeah get people sub get worked masking do. Yes, masks pain ass, also little pain ass. They're surely least intrusive disruptive measures introduced last year, IMO probably last ones go. 

Open retail hospitality first, let people interact freely, ditch masks. once, lead ditching masks. Thanks information. fact researching interpreting age commendable. I'd summarise thoughts two main points. 

1. personally, think risk vaccine side effects extremely low. risks covid hopefully low another unknown. doubt matters (medically) directly whether get vaccinated not, might matter older people around community general.

2. original point feel misuse (not you, many) term anti-vaxxer. applying parents wary giving children covid vaccine, we're diluting meaning. We're misjudging educated people genuine concerns, simultaneously downplaying ignorance ""real"" anti-vaxxers.

I've come across areas too. bad habit people turning everything ""black white"" / ""them vs us"" scenarios, know world really work like that. example, challenge developmental stage abortion legal, make pro-lifer. cutoff point genuine ethical issue needs continual discussion revision. Likewise, query whether genes GM organisms could cause problems transferred natural ecosystems, make anti-GM, genuine risk needs continual monitoring.

If age I'd probably get vaccinated. Whether I'm going vaccinate four-year-old, likely direct risk covid understanding ability give consent, unlikely time soon. makes anti-vaxxer well guess there's suddenly lot scientists doctors joining club year... Elizabeth Holmes studied Stanford 

She briefly undergrad Stanford. real science education. Meh also think that's react half brain. started chaining ppl apartments hospitals many cases. known covid works 1 year Europe US half assed measures neither saved economy ended pandemic. that's politics important combating virus. Maybe lots undetected cases (very mild) among Sino-vaccinated people, infected still spread disease unvaccinated population.  would need provide “evidence” Australia? It’s irrelevant story world. post locked descended hate speech. shit I've mostly flown SW, issues. guess RNG China never Communist. closest came Socialist period experienced Mao Zedong Hua Guofeng, tried push country Socialism attempt place closer Communism long-run. Deng Xiaoping took control China 1978, embraced essentially hardcore Capitalism. make numbers look better put good show  Yeah, super frustrating watch. game 2 giving lead late third lose immediately OT... Ugh  mater declared pandemic. Again, that's finding, policy recommendation.

They made highest possible policy recommendation January. Covid became pandemic exactly policy recommendations ignored countries.  issue China. one strong enough punish meaningful way. huge issue labs research. Fauci team monetarily supporting Wuhan covid research many studies. leading figures behind investigations work covid labs support labs too. could moved 4 level security labs instead done level 2 security labs would make much slower expensive many trying avoid. think escaped lab, exaggerating evidence overestimating research lot. Amen. take two complete doses different vaccines?

Let's say I've gotten Dose 1 Dose 2 mRNA.

After waiting say, anywhere 2 weeks 1 months, take adenovirus vector vaccine? 

i.e.:

Dose 1 Pfizer mRNA

Dose 2 Pfizer mRNA

Rest two weeks one month

How even news? Literally everyone knows unvaccinated people spread COVID-19. least Western WA mostly picking slack. yesterday, King County, 60.3% 16+ fully vaccinated 72.7% received first dose. Get it, hon!!! (What tell rest country Hogan put Old Bay doses, pretty much guaranteeing us Marylanders take it.) I'm actually surprised people investing relationships. opposite since get together them. lost friends close it.

And yeah, played games though friends actually keep friendships. Fair. people choice. thing get, net positive. Also 90% protection hospitalization 100% death, good enough. Exactly thinking. 

Hoping hear soon. Absolutely. we’ve vaccinated. long term data, don’t agree guarantee. like child’s doctor told us cannot tell us happen gets covid vaccine since she’s vaccine allergic reaction past. don’t data yet. right, longer term covid data. something want mess with.    Canada 16 week interval get people one shot. That's percentage fully vaccinated low.  hope get sort definitive answer point. speculation pointless mostly based biases anything. friends dislike China one reason another? lab leak theories. Everyone know tries supportive China? could literally never lab! think point accept plausible explanations nonsense everyone else's plausible explanation investigation turns something definitive. CBS weijia jiang(16 hours ago)

quotes Fauci-----NEW: Dr. Fauci tells **his opinion origins COVID-19 changed: believes “highly likely” first occurred naturally spreading animal human. Since one 100% sure, he’s open thorough investigation..............Dr. Fauci said mean believes virus first emerged lab, suggested.He know anything three researchers Wuhan lab sought hospital care November 2019 reported 15 cases, wow. Good news, shows UK's vaccination program works that, general, vaccines work. think point OP complains media reaction readers have. fault journalism people freak accurately reported facts. academically honest one simply “nobody knows we’ll need booster”

Then ask question first place going reflect answer? job journalists report facts, think people want hear. basing statistics myocarditis coronavirus coronavirus vaccine 4 6 weeks ago barriers still much place. Considering takes 3 weeks get shots, additional weeks second shot take full effect count “fully vaccinated” obviously going lag time new group given vaccine. rocket science. buy whatever theory want to; numbers back up, shown article commenting on. Hell, according polls, younger crowds aren’t even hesitant get vaccine. 25-40 age group hesitant. things true. It’s better vaccine, also sucks compared Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J etc terms efficacy. me, felt like moderate hangover. Tired/groggy bit feverish. Nothing terrible. link Polish basically says country going organise lottery vaccinated people. highest prize 1,000,000 zł (~$275,000) many prices lower amounts cash, cars, scooters, vouchers etc. Good jab Post gonna get downvoted think delay getting COVID-19 vaccine understand pose risk vaccinated yet including children 12 years age, Health Department Northwest Michigan official Peacock, department's health officer, said unvaccinated adults could potentially spread delay getting vaccinated present risk vaccinated vaccinated compromised immune system, like elderly,"" Peacock said. ""**Those reasons aiming 70% population vaccinated need level immunity protect whole population**."" yah kidding, think scientists actually overly concerned variants right now. 3.4 4. reality virus worse vaccine. 

In history vaccines (in US, approved all), basically see side effects show 6 months also show within 2 months. 2 months tons people, pretty sure any.

There clearly side effects, long term ones. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

I'm late 40s getting 1st jab 3 hours (just came quarantine today, returning Malaysia - living - 11 days ago). parents mid-70s fully vaccinated. see I'll 1st jab 3 weeks previously take test immediately driving up, stopping anywhere to. seen 20 months lost sister January cancer. 

Your answer ""bring average 75+ year old's risk approximately mid 20's unvaccinated adult"" indelibly inked brain, continue cautious. Thank you. Great data, raises questions answers. far appears fully vaccinated spreaders symptomatic. vaccine certainly prevent transmission great extend, consider data. looks like fully vaccinated case 63160 even super-spreader. 

Very hard draw conclusions data, many factors testing strategy, occupation status, symptom status etc. Still quite interesting. There's way virus spread like without airborne though. never made sense aerosols involved. experts listening February/March (and posted mid January) always opinion airborne.


It's really unfortunate long took CDC acknowledge basic facts. They're jealous Pfizer got first. Get head sand friend. Southwest empowers employees right thing, employees seem like enjoy job. They’re domestic airline choice. many school aged children died area? Literally zero mine. That's exactly felt US right (a week? Two weeks?) vaccine demand. EU ban export(they already exported 225 Millions doses top programme), good comparison. No. vaccine sucks. vaccine better vaccine. side effect second dose chills.. tbh might anxiety nervous second dose since everyone said got sick..but thankfully second dose breeze me! comment Tedros' performance head WHO, fail see Ethiopian anything it.

Also, vaccine distribution inequality become bullshit first-worlders annoyed reminded exists. Melbourne vaccinations? definitely right level, can't help think Anthrax attacks, US zeroed American bioweapons experts relatively quickly, even immediate aftermath 9/11 - would've easy say ""IT BIN LADEN, QUESTIONS, WE'RE DONE.""  Here's actual v-safe data want know likely side effects are. There's chart middle:

 Thank you, question made look actual numbers instead working old data haha

Caution good, need remember risk unvaccinated 20something extremely low, especially combined 'herd immunity' high vaccination rates reducing actual prevalence covid circulation. vaccines bring mid-70s case fatality rate 1 100 closer 1 10000. bring time no-one worry virus anymore, worry older relatives. ""(unless started offering people like $1000 get it, seems unlikely).""

This sounds like job Mr. Beast! like mask wearing debate

Mask wearing debate because:

1. Vaccinated people basically can't spread virus anyone else, think wear mask anymore. boat I'm in.
2. Pro-mask people argue vaccinated people taking masks enable unvaccinated people take masks, people spread COVID-19 people

And debate goes around circles neither side really giving rebuttal side's argument. Christ, hope they're using Android phones Windows computers too. None.

Most really big numbers what-if scenarios. ""Here's could happen decide anything COVID all.""

The really, really scary scenarios involved hospitals filling up, like happened Italy last spring.

Everyone screeches COVID serious pretend happen. people vaccination issue privacy issue. Lots people know want get vaccinated this. confirmation getting first jab next weekend Pfizer. Know it’s different, anyone 20/30’s Pfizer side effects? least 12 months, literally nothing stops renewing 12 months indefensive. place high cases coming malls, theatres open? one infectious diseases world able avoid tens millions people Yunnan Wuhan making Wuhan hotspot.

Planes, trains, automobile. Lack evidence evidence. loved lived Singapore. really brook nonsense comes public safety. idea cases keep popping from? Security Services for. link? 

what outlets? 

name one   mention “kids aren’t risk severe Covid” we’ve hearing repeat year now.

Someone always responds exactly time mention wanting take safety precautions kids, matter simple. could bring mask wearing say it, could bring eager children vaccinated. know *some* kids risk severe COVID happens, understand debate lockdowns such, stuff like mask wearing debate. Non-compliance marker psychiatric unwellness. mockery mental health care.  Nice one, Canada. Sounds right :). Yeah people current state probably won’t ever get vaccine... crazy different locations different crowd people them. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I've never seen anything 100% mask compliance (up recently stores started lift restrictions) know anyone refuses get vaccine. FoSun purchased small batches BioNTech vaccines initially, predomimantely manufacturers FoSun-BioNTech vaccines mainland China locally. 

Not true afaik. source (news article traditional according understanding, FoSun even set mRNA vaccine manufacturing site anywhere China now.

If proof otherwise, please quote source let others know.

Based (plus less-than-proficient use English resulting ambiguity), rest tried convey really make lot sense... Amazing. vaccines approved 12+ better means get vaccinated quickly. 

Now I’m waiting next age group parent 11 year old. merrier! surprising since Moderna already testing 6month olds. asking? go concert unvaccinated?

NO

it's like asking mechanic drive brakes

what want mechanic say?

what drive slow? NO

the answer always get new brakes.

Now get vaccine tell friends same

The side effects experience nothing compared dying accidentally killing family members disease brought home.

So side-effects completely irrelevant entire conversation. Given testing coverage India, hard say anything definitive. Two weeks ago enough tests. Today enough tests. error bars big enough, lines slope want.

In fact, one explain drop cases fact wave moving cities like Delhi Mumbai, testing poor, villages testing effectively nonexistent. good celebrate stage,” Mauricio Santillana, researcher Harvard Medical School Boston Children’s Hospital, told me. “But cannot fully confident end large unvaccinated population means lot people remain vulnerable virus. don’t know level vaccination needed herd immunity (the level immunity ensures infections won’t spread within community), experts believe require least 60 percent population vaccinated perhaps high 85 90 percent, depending part variants we’re dealing remaining vulnerabilities could grow, too. Natural immunity could fade time, infectious variants could pop up. fall arrives weather cools, people shift activities back poorly ventilated indoor environments airborne viruses easily spread. People could drop guard much, especially Covid-19 cases continue decline think fall winter, things much better,” Ashish Jha, dean Brown University School Public Health, told me. “But may well see bump, may need put mild public health restrictions short periods time see surges cases.” added, “We ready.” disagree. made blanket rule 6 people together. broke it.

If wants separate vaccinated people give privileges, feel fine, specifically state that. Nephews?

We usually call people nephews simplify things, right? Good. ""You can't hold back raw materials benefit nation rest world go empty-handed.""

Of course can, should, particularly democratic government first duty take care people, specially life &amp; death situation like pandemic.

I helping enough (like now, vaccine supply higher demand, giving away vaccines), one dose before. Would anyone (except may antivaxxers) agree prioritize people foreign countries children? Anyone says yes either liar, terrible parent.

Is this: ""A lot people pushed kids' educational benefit, get national economy back gear."" ? 

I'll stand that. Yes, educational benefit children, especially economically educationally risk children. lot areas able implement remote learning. 

Yes, lot people put forth arguments person learning good faith. 

However, whole lot politicians actively worked funding schools, adequately paying teachers, removing lead schools feeding hungry children learn suddenly came yelling important get kids back school *for kids* became clear kids school pulling adults work impacting economy. 

So...yes, think people arguing bad faith gave zero shits education well-being children, covid. 

*Those* people treating teachers like glorified babysitters, me. Oh. Ah, littles, trip zoo also includes riding train, feeding giraffes, going manatee house, indoor spaces, certain crowds. Otherwise meltdowns. live area high % folks ""don't believe"" COVID ""identify vaccinated"" go maskless. 

We happily zoo last summer everyone masked limited crowds. 0% confidence maskeless folks crowds zoo vaccinated. Even kids masked, trust large crowds everyone unmasked, know we've folks locally decided isolate COVID quarantine exposed. 

We've taken pains keep kids safe long, I'm going take risk trip zoo. birthday parties year. summer birthdays, parties last year. year get ""just family"" party us grandparents vaxxed. kids parents ""won't make kids wear mask government says to.""  lotteries seem trick states adopted them, lot cheaper giving everyone small amount. 70% educated estimate based actual data. It’s guess. viruses similar higher rates infection we’ve reached herd immunity for, like Measles. 

70% lower end scale I’ve yet see anyone propose 60% anywhere close reaching herd immunity. experts say 80-90% that’s based past viruses similar even worse infection rates. 

Regardless, entire point OC 70% adults 70% population. It’s far less. Demand dropping vaccine, vaccination rates aren’t rising fast enough people want herd immunity. epidemiologist say Covid circulate similar fashion flu. good catch it, won’t cripple society like 2020.

And nothing, lot parents got vaccinated won’t take kids get Covid vaccine. people saw vaccine “a risk” they’re willing take adult won’t impose children. don’t think it’s decision I’d make parent, it’s reality situation.

I use see wear mask forever straw man, lately I’ve waning that. It’s getting harder find approximations people support mask think take off. terms herd immunity, well, always Covid circulating among unvaccinated people, vast majority people go get shot today want. I’ve seen people argue US shouldn’t reopen Covid currently bad *India*. 

Basically, think people hard time understand within country, we’ve already done bulk work things good going get. don’t see point waiting 2022 “fresh start” people suggested since due seasonality virus January 2022 probably going worse June 2021. Even unvaccinated pretty good summer, don’t fare well winter. Yet people really removing mask summer it’s safe insist waiting quantifiable length time actually meaningful impact point. 20 percent refusing vaccine per recent polling. trials relevant US approval, Canadian approval, US. case using international studies approval. Vaccinated people basically can't spread virus anyone else, think wear mask anymore. boat I'm in.

I would side well, impractical since many governments completely dropping mask mandate altogether, bad faith actors vaccinated follow CDC guidelines wear mask protect unvaccinated people. Perhaps vaccine passports authorities enforce mask mandates unvaccinated would work, right seems like there's good way protect can't vaccinated refuse vaccinated.

When I'm work home vaccinated people over, worry COVID despite unvaccinated children. realistic. However, also means let kids stop wearing masks public, we're still limiting lot public interactions result COVID (which still going around among children area majority adults county fully vaccinated higher number least one dose.)

Absolutely, this! would hesitancy signing kids point. read every piece peer reviewed (and pre-reviewed) document get hands last year (amazing lot time commuting WFH you). amount information available regarding effectiveness safety vaccines S-T-A-G-G-E-R-I-N-G. tell people done research tell ""these rushed, enough data!!"" asking mRNA even J&amp;J vaccine work. Since can't even usually tell basics, tells talking ass. take lot time research READ basics. But, surprised, people even know credit score works read closing disclosure buying house (you know, MAJOR life things people spend time understanding). year definitely real-world experiment Dunning-Kruger effect.... took types meds within hours mine still strong reaction produced antibodies This!!!! People act like kid stays inside go anywhere, kid goes home days watched by, vaccinated, realitives. goes local park friend comes play. I'm rush take mall, must paranoid person mind. life risk, get that, I'm calculating one. flu season.  could see signing older kid, agree. sure I'd sign baby. looking teen trials older kids. would done since adult ones went well. grateful people sign babies vaccine studies. study indicated high attack rate *incredibly* flawed certainly overestimated prior infections wide margin. One thing I've wondering regarding different timelines child vaccinations: families planning summer activities varying timelines? families serious steering clear COVID waiting everyone house fully vaxed (which could mean long time youngest child cutoff)? Maybe compromise summer &amp; keeping outdoor activities? gangstas buss go bang bang bang bang bang bang alll town.. Yeah, I'm going agree 

""A group 18 scientists stated Thursday letter published journal Science enough evidence decide whether natural origin accidental laboratory leak caused Covid-19 pandemic.""  Even teen 90's lot friends whose parents care moved much older boyfriends. people ready let go teens stop parenting 14, others want hold tight baby 40. mean snow days back? Pfizer. Whenever anything mentioned, seems benchmarked Pfizer vaccine. Might well presume gold standard. likely small outbreaks, especially places lower vaccination rates among groups people much less likely vaccinated. [You actually see US counties issue, even overall cases Things could get bad micro level, overall they'll barely move numbers country even state level likely keep us certain number cases foreseeable future. It’s 11 Idaho.

Yeah, surprised too. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I seeing articles last year hadn’t heard real world usage dogs Yep

The Pandemic functionally large parts first world within six months media milking last little bit grift COVID fades virus countries poor vaccine penetration medical infrastructure worry Yeah, one day, maybe residual sluggishness following morning. I’m sorry gonna wanna see card proving got vaccine I’m gonna need card showing got vaccine Flu? What’s next cards showing don’t got HIV STDs get f?!k outta bullshit. It’s body don’t want vaccine don’t want vaccine ,,,,pro choice right that’s left pro choice don’t choice he’ll I’m getting vaccinated I’m wearing mask either fine 43 yrs life. don’t get flu shots either u know haven’t sick 20 years that’s problem get vaccinated weakens years become dependent. I’m person body I’m getting vaccinated way hell well US labelled post so… No, people got infected tests limited, deaths went uncounted, everywhere.

This says 6k excess deaths Wuhan, rise better evidence, feel free post.

As general situation China, here's something posted days ago based leaked CCP weirdly negative spin data considering contents, tl;dr leaked internal documents CCP, shows regular levels incompetence sub-optimal practises common covid time, really anything paticularly malicious. 

""However, though documents provide evidence deliberate attempt obfuscate findings, reveal numerous inconsistencies authorities believed happening revealed public.""

""The documents, cover incomplete period October 2019 April year, reveal appears inflexible health care system constrained top-down bureaucracy rigid procedures ill-equipped deal emerging crisis. several critical moments early phase pandemic, documents show evidence clear missteps point pattern institutional failings.""

""Conversely, however, leaked documents also provide something defense China's overall handling virus. reports show early stages pandemic, China faced problems accounting, testing, diagnosis still haunt many Western democracies even -- issues compounded Hubei encountering entirely new virus."" think theory also coincides lot people’s politics: think US-China relations, think certain ex-president, etc. It’s surprise “xenophobic” go-to. Ugh. mildly infuriating year people say ""global pandemic"" 

The pandemic part continue epidemics coming home stretch. probably never proper investigation confirm rule lab leak theory. seems quite plausible though. Learned Stop Worrying Love Lab-Leak Theory

Google article, blocked reddit, AMAZINGLY detailed. Well researched. 

No proof lab leak, certainly shows ""possible"". Fortunately, teens Texas often much wiser many adults Texas. Vasovagal response, common thing. would advise anytime get poked needle future, advise staff fainted getting poked before. staff know do. Thanks sharing 

Had minorly sore arm first one, awaiting second one 

Was one day? 100% agree Fauci here. me, doesn’t seem like “lab leak” theory likely, also don’t think it’s properly investigated. Even Tedros distanced report topic. There’s also disagreement top-level scientists likely is.

But I’ve discussed topic subreddit before, I’ve basically called conspiracy theorist. They're overconfident ability verify information, help. believe they're reading truth, 100% time, confirms something believe. Yes? That’s got shots. I’d walk local Walmart (near close) always page “come get shots them”. dude didn’t try hard enough. That's actually unreasonable. Something like could happened US:  Nothing first shot except arm soreness. Second shot made feel like gotten flu terms chills weakness; basically stayed bed entirety day after. Exactly, worried it? Look Long COVID.

At minimum, long term complications COVID respiratory illnesses (such pneumonia), also large number reports medium long term persistent symptoms COVID specific. include neurological symptoms well.

The first Long COVID clinic Canada recently opened city actively looking people experiencing Long COVID symptoms better understand better treat perfectly fine still questions origins covid. may never know full answer. Fosun invested hundreds millions BioNTech. Golden rule: gold makes rules. Fourth: Many experts believe coronavirus behave like influenza seasonal respiratory viruses, flare anew come winter. would fifth distinct wave pandemic (counting big surges last spring winter, smaller bumps last summer fewer people vulnerable, wave coming winter would probably less brutal last time around. much depends whether people would willing take precautions again, wearing masks.

I wonder experts think they're going get masks back anyone toothpaste exploded tube actually interact people outside medical experts mean China also totalitarian country history controlling citizens similar fashion secure national interests. surprised acted way took steps did. mention, many cancers autoimmune diseases RESULT viruses acquired earlier life know nothing ok. 😅 government agency president presides influenced president. work together. It’s absolutely crazy everyone flipped people even questioning started lab. Calling racist xenophobic.

Well first response got immediately deleted (I guess probably mentioned many political words, makes sense) I'll keep one shorter.

It's case ""the boy cried conspiracy."" people claim bunch BS guise ""I'm asking questions."" push lab idea (especially when, true, deflects blame poor covid response), surprising people would disregard BS typically push. actually believe 100k infections less 5k deaths, bridge sell you. ask lost third year life? understand play dates museum outings probably limited, 3 year old’s world SMALL anyway. say good luck god bless him. push get international oversite Chinese labs

Yeah, good luck Referring Oxford vaccine produced indian SII ""indian vaccine"" far accurate calling AZ AZ neither invented produced them. virus variant first found Manaos, Brazil. similar South Africa one found 1.4 2.6 times transmissible vanilla covid. spreading like wildfire. Yassssss :) - looking forward ""revenge spending"" vacation Vancouver US month now! 😍 Well said it’s world wide collaborative Aus might 2023, parts world dire needs might minimal testing snd straight market. Anything places like India would better nothing. DPA doesn’t block exports, puts orders front. company fulfill order still extra production capacity, free export. throttling supply chain, organizing it. fact, DPA supply chain would worse DPA force companies work 24/7, whereas without likely wouldn’t. also allows us bring suppliers wouldn’t even supply chain allow companies work together otherwise wouldn’t able due restrictions anticompetitive behavior. 

Look, SII argument sending supplies India bad spot doesn’t look like US produced vaccines going imported. CureVac? would taking needed materials away Pfizer Moderna giving instead. It’s easy demand don’t determine gets less. got morning ritual checking sub  Ontario (Canada) rolling vaccination eligability age, went birth year, jan 1, dec 31 matter. Joy mandatory sterilization! Finally safe sex college! Everyone 16+ get vaccinated every single state many states 12+ get vaccinated. don’t buy theory. walk mass vaccination site, grocery store, large retailer etc get vaccine, there’s really barriers whatsoever anymore. 100% understand provinces going first dose strategy. many people crossed border last time went second doses. pointless idea people go way get early second dose extra protection peace mind may get it. happened mind sharing 

Did feel anything first shot? It’s unfortunate people prioritize tastebuds creature’s entire existence. grow accustomed new flavors. animal can’t get life back.  Hah, joke actually add counter-rant. Still dice. They've subscribed flavor chips used tracking also able allow mind control...I really wish kidding... point, deep south states Rockies comparatively low *most* states outpacing nation whole. Depends country. it’s US (given Post) time discuss December vaccines approved. It’s basically unless you’re big time goober  short sweet time us introverts. Back extravert-dominated world, suppose.  Yeah sucks, it’s sooo close finally. Can’t say I’m mad spending first half June trip Utah, Colorado Wyoming.... Coming UK Friday young vaccinated yet here, good news sounds like added extra line ""List reasons leave job"" everything works well, Argentina start making next month, although production probably start slow. think different companies variety strategies. company required us office months, vaccine vaccine. Masks still required desk. strategy strategy. 

My husband's company told anyone can't vaccinated work home indefinitely. get vaccinated, incentive program instead they're back office 3 days week. fill form online, get gift card, extra vacation time take mask. form filled out? manager repeatedly remind put mask back on.

I think strategy pretty genius, tbh. They're protecting people can't vaccinated, they're rewarding get subtly punishing people refuse. voluntary. one required share vaccine status form. form gets mask purgatory. Yeah

Mine weird streak things could also use back x-ray tell someone exactly bad posture messing also heavily preached things actually cause long term damage like making kids lug overweight backpacks around halls Lol, didn’t make conclusions. literally said isn’t scientific consensus one direction another.

Fauci longer saying evidence points strongly direction natural jump.

That aren’t able acknowledge change previously saying evidence very, strong makes obvious weird agenda here.

It’s clear right make others wrong. Oh need lockdown UK ban international travel 5G chips stopped working report in. /s know, I'm saying thrown 11 year olds first group allow population kids become eligible earlier. (Sorry, I'm impatient parent high risk 11 year old.) 5 days worth data may numbers likely fluctuate next two days due actual uptake rate. used estimates CDC including population numbers close 10 years old 5 percent low. part percent estimate 4-5 percent higher sake consistency stick 2010 census estimate CDC uses. 

5.217 million NJ residents 1st dose - 58.7%

5.033 million 18+ 1st dose - 72.5%

(5.020 million - 72.3% yesterday)

89.4% 65+ first dose (89.3% yesterday)

At rate, first dose shots reach percentages dates. 

Total Population Numbers(58.7% Now)

7 Day Rolling Average (really 5 days) 26,363 first dose shots. Like said might fluctuate wildly next two days due calculations based 5 days uptake itself. data anyone wants see different way presenting data lmk. look articles Italy prevented 250.000 doses exported. Vaccines still distributed time goes people notice people vaccinated living lives, getting sick. make want vaccine too. Anglophone media mocking EU slow vaccination time attacking exporting enough vaccines. crap. good news people bad science also bad math. lottery seems work. People love bad stats subreddit long favor vaccine. vaccine effective enough without bs Looks like Ohio started trend lol could gone 50ug phase 1 trial 25/100/250. tried 100 vs 50 later on, worked want waste weeks... Y’all qaeda heart goes families lost someone Covid-19 chance get vaccine. read article? get higher, fully approved. 

Once accessible rural areas, actually start vaccinations POC many states behind.  actually Biontech/Fosun China. Biontech partnered Fosun Pharma Chinese market Pfizer. Fosun partnership predates Pfizer partnership. 61.6% received least 1 dose. believe reach herd immunity. fully vaccinated.

I still wear mask socially distance.

Why? 3 kids home age 12.

I going continue 3 vaccinated. One day, moment don’t know cutoff level immune. good news we're still vaccinating 1.8 million people per day average. bump 70% quite easily. 61% one dose. Covid mild majority people. [Because separate trial kids 6 months 12 Precisely. 
If particular point was
 hammered home communication get government media, might help overcome vaccine hesitancy.

We victims success - sitting ducks tbh. sad going reach proportion. one refuse FREE dose something HARMLESS protects dangerous virus? Truly mind-boggling. people ever heard Polio? Vaccines saved millions lives yet large portion population luxury gall refuse simple shot. Yeah, totally ready Crisis 21st century. Federal law would almost certainly trump state law this. going happen, moot point. would need see comparative study person learning entirety child population versus amount missing school due influence Covid infection make type assumption implying.

Would really interesting see think reaching point abstract assumptions us make head way changing persons opinion. Moderna included 11 year olds trial, knowing Pfizer going approved first exact age group? could made approval much exciting. FA cup final probably lifetime experience Leicester fans. got second shot today, oddly enough. 

Hoping side effects bad, round 1 slowed bit! Like, point death?

Oil defense contracts already disgustingly filthy rich people. Oh that, also someone could prove daddy big boy. That's pretty much it. us use political tool. Vaccines allies first. lot people vents received first dose yet. show negative test gain entry. also sub quickly losing regular viewership COVID longer daily concern even passing thought anymore. Meaning people left concerned interested - likely continue believe measures needed. want thank much comment highlights importance using Bayesian analysis, least include confidence intervals. Reporting number consistently misleading.  F covid homies hate covid dumbest comment I’ve read today. boyfriends stance. January doesn’t see need getting shot right regardless bitching get it. include minding business respect parents chose vaccinate children?

Just want see “mind business” pendulum swings directions. people site think Repubs anti vax? Ever seen vaccination statistics whites vs blacks/hispanics? no, Reddit, white people bad republicans bad. actually relevant topic, though. Sucks people, actually proof cases athletes see getting 1 627,329 unless baselessly assuming 101 million people exposed virus including calculation. vaccines worldwide two Chinese ones indisputably worst results worst efficacy. said better getting covid that's sure saw trend Israel, I'm really glad come fruition. bottom seems completely dropping out. end COVID US. Hopefully rest world see well vaccines work similar better results. know lot anti vax idiots US, monopoly anti vax vaccine hesitancy. apple apple, long 101 million fully vaccinated? 0-3 month mostly, would consider 21 days 2nd doses breakthrough ( since technically supposed get full protect 14 days 2nd doses. 5-7 days show symptoms) 50 percent probably best gonna get. Also DeWine million dollar lottery genius. 5 winners yet hundreds thousands got shots. Money motivation gets results. referring kids symptoms longer 12 weeks. Even missing failing participate fully school months could result failure pass classes missing information knowledge could harmful kids' educational development. 

This idle speculation either. many effects measles vaccination efforts find vaccinating kids increases cognitive development educational attainment relative vaccinated. Clearly, vaccine making kids smarter, measuring benefit eliminating deleterious effects kids getting sick critical phases lives. 

Obviously, COVID-19 measles different diseases, given information I've shared already, possible developmental delays caused COVID least comparable caused measles. great ideas get people fence get vaccinated. Sure wish lived one vaccine lottery states though winning million dollars protecting covid would pretty dope saying 1,000 Americans killed meteorites year? sounds like problem need address.

Related: something like 300 people die per day earthquakes Tehran, 10,000 people per year die eventual yellowstone eruption. think incidence infection (4 3000 across arms) morbidity/mortality resulting infections (none reported) inform overall assessment risk/benefit. Lol forget subreddit you’re on? “You reek COVID.”

Hopefully daughter stops visiting keep “safe” Bring hate I'm Jewish people went plenty shit let kill us modern day. 

People educate themselves. Hypochondriacs existed continue exist this. you. surely evidence? 

Proceeds provide zero evidence fucking dumb form conclusion reading article? Olympians drink ambrosia nectar can’t imagine happening getting held courts. It’s good idea, though.  comes trials; told participants there. actually believe anything take (alcohol probably worst) would make vaccines particularly less effective. think that's bit different seems intent ""don't portray military favoring particular candidate"" everyone military forced go, suggesting public military supports someone. expect national news stations...oh wait, kidding? Ok, please could tell directly: think zero covid acceptable strategy?  TIL 15 million per day rollout mundane. fiance doctor Mississippi, patients even listen lmfao answered question - China ""unnescessarily"" strict measures. considered is, fact, measures prevent outbreaks? recall, there's covid outbreak city, everyone alerted infected exactly they've spent time extensive contact tracing takes place. infected sent Covid Units isolate away family, whole city adopts strict measures.

You say ""too strict"" even though measures strict covid detected. Outside that, they've rather mild. power reacting immediately squashing outbreak properly begin. really see work long decent degree competence place. since whole economy national image (+ public opinion) rests suppressing it, massive incentive take seriously fuck up. Insertions part normal genetic mutations. assume common knowledge people take courses genetics. likely interpret ""insertion"" mean someone insertion. 

Is like people call internet Wifi. people know specific terms form ideas based misunderstanding see terms used professionals.  too. know there's chance she'll catch starts school fall (especially city drops mask mandate reason), I'd feel even guilty got seriously ill decided ignore safety guidelines. want pay negligence, especially since I'm depending people responsible, bothers anything. opinion humanity plummeted. imagine guy wear PPE walking room bats simple cage. Little know bats infected coronavirus gets transmitted aerosols. Notice never said policy approach effectively same. excuse Biden cause overt dumbass, much like currently caught rhetoric Mask wearing still basically universal stores posted signs live people mostly polite say. places like outdoor malls understand people want put mask back repeatedly. fact see large minority still wearing purely outdoor stuff I'm surprised by. makes sense - airborne transmissible right, therefore highest R0 values? look like RSV parainfluenza making roaring comeback young kids. learned croup hard way year half ago. problem, mobile read article sure whether would pointed there. sense, think company towns thinking Japanese workplace mentality 20 years ago. People worked company, even met company, went company doctor, company events... went straight Uni best job best company could get basically defined life died.

It's new generations, course, paint picture. idea success, way, still ""you join super well known company work life"", think join Ford work forever. Here. mean agree anyone who, point, says 100% comes lab dumb. there’s big difference “there’s 0 proof came lab,” “there’s 0% chance came lab.” former could open proof found. latter closed-minded saying 100% came lab.

And agree there’s need precise language. there’s difference baseless speculation asking questions. lot valid questions ask lab leak theory.

I repeatedly refer “stopping discussion” said it’s important discuss right we’re still dealing pandemic. Moderna cause body manufacture spike proteins Pfizer, likely side-effects bit stronger. theory expect might result stronger anti-body response better efficacy, seem case practice. Pfizer's enough get job done.  PRO VACCINATION person. title click bait. 

He's saying idea ""once xx % vaccinated, _herd immunity_ "" good way frame issue.

I know title intentionally misleading innocently badly would *****a fair rate say reached***** herd dealing virus doesn’t change, mathematicians could work ***what proportion population vaccinated order stop virus tracks***. herd immunity really stop circulation vaccinating enough people. know measles need 95% people vaccinated. viruses, may 80% virus, changing. herd immunity original strain last year would possible. we’re dealing different variants, continue emerge transmit vaccinated populations. think forget herd immunity. It’s wrong concept virus find ways transmitting immune populations. sense, real question proportion people need vaccinated, minimize number people going hospital, maybe even stop completely.

 think actually high proportion population risk need vaccinated. difficulty even vaccinated everyone age 50, stop 99% hospitalizations. then, give point, younger adults, under-50s, still get disease. there’s many countries, people vulnerable go difficult one balancing requirement try minimize hospitalizations. you’ve vaccinated over-50s, next step programs, hopefully world protected, going start vaccinate wider under-50s.  Masks minor cause restrictions. Capacity restrictions hurting businesses. important thing check actual case rates county/city. can’t catch Covid nobody store it. cases actually high area, use curbside pickup delivery, take kids outside park zoo socialize get house. agree, huge problem. Probably _the biggest_ problem have. I'm somewhat surprised honest get hit hard right now, seemed control longest time. 

I tend watch ... weird stuff TV getting ready fall asleep, one happens ""walk"" videos, Tokio, pretty much see everyone wear masks even outside street entire time (alas keeping distance though ...), thought disciplined behaviour dodged bullet. seem case anymore ... :/ time call people are: mentally ill.

I'm trying mean seriously feel bad really need seek help...  There's ""vaccine"" one shot Moderna know effect stronger. Probably given similar efficacy reports.

Both vaccine makers would started testing different dose amounts settled highest dose well tolerated. possible additional trials Moderna could reduce dose probably worth effort.  lack intermediary animal, that's missing link. I'm belief accident, researchers caught it, quickly mutated+spread. Idk suggesting potentially manmade known origin virus China implicitly racist. blaming China without explicitly blaming China gives validity world anti China sentiments. That's still racist af. vaguely recall Pfizer found testing higher amount vaccine change efficacy, Moderna's vaccine likely stronger. think CDC states officially released recovery numbers; hospitalization numbers. worldometers estimates recovered numbers. really nationalism. human nature. Deep down, people selfish. average person going care getting 10 closest family friends vaccinated, example, 1000 strangers. interested protecting things affect first. something proud of, inevitable. literally said isn’t scientific consensus one direction another.

This literally said: ""Things changed pretty dramatically consensus around lab lean theory.""

You're obscenely disingeneous. Oh I’m curious too. First things firsts though. would rather investigate people throwing pandemic response plans claiming it’s political conspiracy hurt chances re-election. Maybe investigate get adults wear mask.

""Eh"", higher temperatures mean actually condensation, rain; happens go along change happens go down. That’s drug sniffing K9’s work.. probable cause 4 legs.

The reality scientists report number cases treatment control groups, case cases treatment group.

They'll still report level uncertainty (that is, they'll give error bars).

So 100% efficacy right number quote result study. mean exactly reporters make sound like means.

It's still good thing, though.

If process expect, say, 10 cases average, get 0, still say something probability getting 0 true expectation value 10 know case numbers tend distributed. kind agree you, check recent incident Belarus. maybe 99.9% people ok though. Hopefully 40% vaccinated TN urban areas live. Myocarditis viruses (and vaccines) often autoimmune reaction, caused directly virus itself. time look sources search ""myocarditis virus autoimmune"" several. 

I presume sum total active vaccine causes it, need spike protein adjuvant stimulate proper immune response, would need stimulate autoimmune response leads myocarditis. mask mandates vaccinated people vaccinated people problem. Besides, everyone wearing masks mandates--for vaccinated people!--were lifted.  Herd Immunity Threshold fluid number, based geography/population density, variants, level existing natural infection, weather, etc. March 2020 estimate 60% based original Wuhan variant best guess r0 2.5. new variants probably increased number bit, number also lower summer, higher big cities, lower rural areas  April, European Union report said Russian Chinese media systematically seeking sow mistrust Western COVID-19 vaccines disinformation campaigns aimed West.

I think mRNA sounds scary abbreviation (or initialism whatever pedants want call it). Reading process makes sound like efficient, safest way get immunity. Effective word base efficacy. 100% effective means efficacy 100%.

This simplification though small sample size. almost always better show 95% confidence credible interval small samples.  case split 0-4, giving extremely wide credible interval 100% claim simply misleading. Indeed, Bayesian analysis (with uninformed prior would assess 75% effective, 95% credible interval would useless -10%-99.5% (unless screwed math).

Not efficacy really matters small study like this; using uninformed prior really justified. know vaccines work really well, true number probably 95% age groups. safety data going important younger groups. way, guess right. I'm still happy got vaccine! goes current data science. tell shouldn’t trust it? Give studies, logic factual reasons change mind. “It’s mask” isn’t going cut it. feel like dismissal people discuss lab leak theory, paint “on purpose” vs accident. So, causes people shut down. Royal Canadian LARP Force virtual epidemic important public figures shamelessly flouting violating restrictions tell us necessary impose rest us. 

It's hard break skeptics measures say ""Listen, even authorities believes bad say - truly believed dangerous, violating health policies""

There needs serious soul searching investigations over. personally believe flagrantly irresponsible behavior part many many politicians experts caused much unnecessary loss life creating furthering belief problem serious. I'm waiting long haul covid, stroke risks, etc start piling thought covid like flu. I'm sure conspiracy theories explaining away effects somehow unrelated callous disregard science. Good! height selfish disrespect fellow soldiers. California state university That's nice, rate varies wildly state. places still far threshold herd immunity vulnerable variants.

I'm vaccinated, patience people refused isolate, social distance, wear masks, refuse vaccination. fallout them, me. part 14 months.  also choose travel abroad go concerts choose workplace care vaccinations. could go camping instead holiday abroad. Free air, nature, restrictions. understand argument, sorry. possible wait out. C19 human species long time.

C19 find way boarders. little slip takes C19 spreading. Take Taiwan example.

Vaccination option. take years. end 2021 less time big enough vaccine supply long enough time full inoculation schedule followed. agree assertion unusual situation. required effort determine happened. make assumptions data in.

However, noted scientists (in area airflow) knew transmission via aerosols happening ignored rather rudely favor constant (5 microns) no-one knew came from. panel unwilling listen research issue fully. fact cut citing 5 micron constant criteria what's considered airborne.

As turns out, respiratory viruses level aersol transmission. fairly obvious flu transmits way well. course viruses also transmit via droplets surfaces, five micron constant accepted fact room argument. common sense course there's nuance, droplets larger size suspended air, shorter time periods. fact flu viruses long found areas prevailing wisdom true (like air vents example). Yet no-one questioned prevailing wisdom have.

The lesson accept constants fact without understanding context. panel CDC guilty accepting old data point fact without first understanding full context study produced it. thing convinced group determined people researching origin number plainly showing false. 

In words, scientist capable rest us making false assumptions. they’re private entities, EU exporting anything? shared e-mails Euronews show proposition someone claiming work UK-based PR company. She’s toast. No, they'll get and, statistically speaking, walk away little issue part. They'll rave bad covid validate shitty decisions getting vaccinated. They'll continue denounce vaccinated crowd wasting time afraid big bad covid.

Sure, bad experience even die, they'll minority. terrific news, think almost certain push us threshold herd immunity. Lots people already covid (quite reasonably IMO) saying feel need also get vaccine. N don’t see distinction promoting moisturizer promoting anti-vaxx pandemic?  came area once. Two weeks rally, outbreaks started popping up.

That alarmingly orwellian, anti-scientific. 

Now see again, obvious shortly breakout, least plausible originated lab accident important able discuss things try arrive truth matter. 

At least hopefully one longer make mistake considering politifact authoritative reliable source.  quire get logic. origin company? Company != government. American not, private entity.

These numbers wild. even it’s true, OP’s original statement 10-30% kids infected experiencing symptoms 6 months incorrect.

First quote: 13.3% **adults** **symptomatic** covid experience 28 days (let alone 6 months).

Is article trying say kids higher risk greatly longer symptoms covid adults? haven’t heard even whisper anywhere else…and would HUGE deal true.

The second quote based study kids diagnosed hospital. sample kids taken hospital can’t equated kids whole.

I empathy parents need consider right now. I’m one people got vaccinated doesn’t give shit people now.

I’m saying throwing outlandish claim 10-30% kids infected get sick 6 months extremely reckless. need make decisions based best information possible. 

I’ll throw another quote second link it’s advocacy group Long Covid Kids says currently details 1200 children long covid 890 families England. “And number rising quickly,” says founder Sammie Mcfarland. “Not one returned previous health, unable normal activities.”

**Not one returned previous health?? Really??**

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Weird. recall people specifically saying airborne. recall people thinking spread surfaces, course. way. plateau requires reproductive rate near 1 sustainable. We'll either R&lt;1 cases go 0 everyone (in particular area) catch it.

R values going different different strain. actually know lineages different strains (versus simply variants). R(t) certainly much less 1 B.1.1.7 B.1.526 account large majority cases country. R(t) may near 1 probably P.1. R(t) may still 1, possibly well 1, B.1.617.2, enough cases matter time. course know vaccines basically fully effective current lineages, dealing contagious lineages means vaccinating people.

The actual R(t) depends serial interval transmissions guessed (the CDC study shows algebraic average 3.96, instance - algebraic average actually relevant value sadly). weekly growth great proxy. We're currently -24% per week; pace we're something like 6 weeks away 10k cases day (an arbitrary reasonable milestone end pandemic). However pace shrinking accelerating might faster (we still vaccinating 3-4% unvaccinated per week, dropping R(t) similar amount whatever delay period).

In best case scenario, local transmissions go 0 R(t)&lt;1 value everywhere US, we'll still get steady trickle imported cases next months least. could look like plateau, would tiny one care.

Watching Israel give us idea future - match vaccination rate. closest Hubei province. 

In addition, latest signals motors virus likely came Southern also needs way people can't get vaccine 2nd dose legitimate medical reason serious adverse reaction 1st dose prove can't actually get fully vaccinated.

I'll preface saying still think everyone get vaccine despite unfortunate experience... enthusiastic get fully vaccinated, ended hospitalized pulmonary embolism doses (healthy 31 y.o. risk factors history clots), advised doctor hospital pulmonologist return 2nd dose (may vaccine, coincidence strong ignore, worth risk individual risk 2nd dose triggering another clotting episode). I'm dreading dismissed anti-vaxxer losing right participate civil society unlucky enough one individuals serious adverse reaction 1st dose.

I'm businesses requiring proof vaccination, needs verifiable work around unfortunate souls can't get 2nd dose documented adverse reaction first dose, we're dismissed lumped anti-vaxxers people b.s. fake ""I can't wear mask"" cards.  haven’t let kid see friends? I've written past. two problems trying differentiate 1-3 &amp; 4. first difficult build evidence one way without direct testimony China. second even China admitted lab leak would anyone believe them? anyone honestly think China building weapon going publicly admit whole world? would take naivety boarding rubishness believe that. 

So end 1-4 amount thing politically even might mean thing scientifically. Always thought well ugh.......... allow sports betting stakes.  didn’t say consensus changing (maybe aren’t alleging that). Like said, found article balanced exposition know not. thought helpful resource. Oh sarcastic? great they're school. district trying set program summer. actually got call hour ago Texas Dept Health opening daughter, they're really starting roll out.  extreme Chinese propaganda came around virus circumstances makes suspicious.

i also read article satellites scanned hospitals around wuhan outbreak found substantial increase traffic parking lots .. another attempt find origin .. course scientific interesting

Glad don’t this. even safe :|

(But right, holy shit got completely outclassed Boston/Rask) Yes is! leftovers tomorrow national brown bag day celebrate well! mean, there's wanting kid sick six months. article nothing masks? Get vaccinated dogs smile. mute stories while. :) it. Otherwise reasonable people shooting lab leak theory long time, scientific consensus (relatively early) genome hallmarks artificial synthesis.

That always seemed like flawed logic me. like rhino found blocks away zoo biologists came said ""the DNA seems natural origin"" general public took ""See there's way could've come zoo!""

No one knows really happened, coincidences one keep piling up. China, knowledge lab leak, certainly favors obfuscating investigation every turn. 

Almost 3.5 million people dead, world standstill full year, yet know nothing came from. Natural transmission lab leak, need understand happened. power truly afraid hold China's feet fire? know dude. ridiculous takes people get one  opening 100% restrictions gone Vermont get 80%.   we're ones companies making money of. countries overall less wealthy, advantages like healthcare paid taxes corporations country. got mine early March outside baseball stadium. parking lot staffed Nat'l Guard, DHS, FEMA personnel (you'd think many volunteers, dressed like civilians). think medical personnel on-site ones administering shots, I'm guessing six one time.

But... last time serious illness took six months recover from?  like you?

We've solid year governments gaslighting people with: ""Kids get this"" , ""Kids spread this."", ""It's like flu kids"", ""sure, 10%-30% kids get COVID experience long Covid symptoms ... totally ok \*most\* recover ... six months? Most?""  Because, course, society properly function parents need stay home take care family, schools closed. Literally money world depended somehow affecting kids, use lungs like rest us.  there's still pressure world soft-sell effect kids, again, money needs us back office.

Get vaccinated. wear mask.  One would think bodes well Phase III results.

You sign huge manufacturing contracts know vaccine viable. thing keeps spreading around, often it'll chance mutate, likely it'll get new version evade vaccines we've made far. hmm wouldnt put past lab leak, malicous intent, wouldnt first time china poor safety standards, hell Sars-Cov-1 lab escape too. 6 weeks later, sounds right. Well, I'm sure rest country, California June 15 date locked almost full reopening state It’s absolutely crazy everyone flipped people even questioning started lab. Calling racist xenophobic.

The issue many different opinions nuance people listen nuance. still happening today even revelation. 

I know anyone importance said idea virus could accidentally leaked Wuhan lab racist xenophobic, quotes people saying I'd love see them. can't wait go Bingo again! basic understanding science? “All”?

You dismiss want it’s pretty incorrect say conviction kids aren’t affected Covid. There’s still learn. would think. part strike team rural prison. \~70% population tested positive little symptoms. I'm comparing prison , microcosm society, telling terms symptoms. again, guys young healthy. speculation I'm also inclined believe reasons schools major breakouts fact kids catch never knew it. Huh. That's interesting way dismiss people arguments understand.

But March many around world still saying everything's gonna ok, need wear mask unless  safety looks absolute

But mean zero risk vaccines *already* undergone recommended trial periods? Otherwise would safety / adverse effect purpose undertaking trials first place? covid vaccines undergone trial time periods required vaccine trials prior pandemic. They're also being, planned be, administered children unprecedented rate compared vaccines, much less time observe adapt potential problems might arise. see difference here? tail end pandemic too. Classic. Others decided intentionally ignore experience: ""Hey, China building big new hospital outbreak locking Wuhan - virus probably harmless, let's go vacation take home"" think so. author journalist put words together suspect understand issues he's discussing work real lab. He's Fox news several times. previously written book basically said black people genetically predisposed less intelligent (""A Troublesome Inheritance"".) claims many crazy things list reasonable summary direct quote book. says research genetics races ""shaped leftist Marxist political dogma, science.”

I yet hear anyone really understands what's possible lab- ie real virology researcher- say lab leak anything unlikely impossible. You’re assuming “slight decrease chances”. think every little bit helps. Masks aren’t big deal me. Sorry bother much. 82 kids 9 months substantially higher rates infection now, you’re worried 100 die next 3 months half US vaccinated rising? summer school out?

Your risk evaluation badly whack.

That seems incredibly odds claiming. do. But... last time serious illness took six months recover from? like you?

Appeal emotion. serious respiratory illness kid(lasted year). sucked. thankfully recovered. influence interpretation totally ok *most* recover ... six months?

From new recommendations Thursday, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, C.D.C. director, cited two recent scientific findings significant factors: vaccinated people become infected virus, transmission seems rarer still; vaccines appear effective known variants coronavirus. 

Remember, got infected, recovered, got least one dose Pfizer, immunity multiple variants, also SARS-CoV-1, virus named SARS 2003. Turns much [the ""breadth"" immunity thinking:

US : 

Children seem spread virus effectively adults. 

We okay vaccination numbers lots natural immunity.

Adults spread virus much effectively children. that's good news. half people 11 vaccinated, many natural immunity. 

So yes, children vulnerable infection, tend superspreaders. people going get infected cause spread already done so, vaccinated. Now, still tons people could infected left. So, need help math :

What additional value vaccinating one additional older person vs younger person? vaccinate young person, protecting person. vaccinate old person, probably preventing spread. Positive test rate still decreasing (slowly) probably number tests week vs last week.

With movement restrictions taken away, unvaccinated people spreading virus (for part), thanks collective immunity. unvaccinated people able meet friends walk drink outside, given meeting seem cause significant spread get vaccine tell friends same

Why would want get vaccine? absolutely do, they're limited UK age range. well, may able get one next week. People younger may wait 2 months.

My point vaccination programme requires young people board UK plan, involved excluding young people vaccination 6 months. also think young people accept able go walk friend, seriously undermining trust healthcare system rules govern movement moment.

I hope understand sort thing impact young people can't asked suspend lives indefinitely older people holidaying around Europe.  No. New Zealand similar GDP Greece Australia plan locally produce AstraZenica vaccine (something Canada can't do) scuppered negative AZ press. government since bought enough Pfizer everyone 50.

Moderna said Tuesday coronavirus vaccine, authorized use adults, powerfully effective 12- 17-year-olds, planned apply Food Drug Administration June authorization use vaccine adolescents.

If approved, vaccine would become second Covid-19 vaccine available U.S. adolescents. Federal regulators authorized Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine month 12- 15-year-olds.

The Pfizer shot initially authorized use people 16 older, Moderna’s available 18 up.

Proof vaccines’ efficacy safety adolescents helping school officials leaders plan fall. Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said public school students New York City, largest school system United States, would return in-person learning fall.

New York’s move comes several states indicated restrict remote learning, including Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts New Jersey.

The Moderna results, company announced statement, based clinical trial enrolled 3,732 people ages 12 17, two-thirds received two vaccine doses. cases symptomatic Covid-19 fully vaccinated adolescents, company reported. translates efficacy 100 percent, figure Pfizer BioNTech reported trial vaccine 12- 15-year-olds.

“These look like promising results,” said Dr. Kristin Oliver, pediatrician vaccine expert Mount Sinai Hospital New York. “The vaccines protect adolescents Covid, better.”

Moderna also reported single dose vaccine 93 percent efficacy symptomatic disease.

“Those cases occur two doses mild, also good indicator protection disease,” Saskia Popescu, infectious disease epidemiologist George Mason University, said email.

The side effects consistent reported adults: pain site injection, headache, fatigue, muscle pain chills. “No significant safety concerns identified date,” company said.

The adolescents study monitored year second dose.

The results announced news release contain detailed data clinical trial. Dr. Rasmussen said vaccines’ efficacy trickier evaluate children, less likely develop symptomatic disease adults.

Nevertheless, said, results line scientists expected suggest “that adolescents respond vaccine comparably adults receive it.”

Moderna said planned submit data publication peer-reviewed journal. 2nd Pfizer dose yet, 1st dose hit harder (and weirder) expected. Death negative outcome disease - parent wants see kid grow complication later learn due covid exposure You’re right - they’re grouped together much merged brain. It’s 2-11 6mo-2. expected Pfizer EOY. discussed multiple times mostly concern people cannot sure given real vaccine (fakes, etc), traveling countries recognize vaccine already had.

Thank helpful reply. Please may know TWiV read information? Thank you. see 76 cases yesterday? VA Dept Health website says 654 cases nothing microchips Vaccines stuff, vaccines problemen QR code.

Not mention MRNA nothing DNA. like message gets destroyed delivery. Yet people trusting DNA based vaccines far longer--- even though interact directly DNA. Long COVID observed Evidence first study long covid children suggests half children aged 6 16 years old contract virus least one symptom lasting 120 days, 42.6 per cent impaired symptoms daily consequences long covid children debilitating. UK parliamentary briefing 26 January, Mcfarland described 14-year-old daughter started become vacant, weak unresponsive catching covid-19 March toddler bad immune system ontop age everything goes mouth risk slightly higher average. Ontop that, meant taking crowded indoor places, still go local park times many kids. Hence hope non vaccinated adults get sidelined refused buses planes concerts indoor places, since there’s way know unmasked person vaccinated contagious. say American based airlines great, compare various governments vanity projects little unfair.

I comparing service quality customer experience, think contrast fair. agree airlines problematic foundations, anything reality ME3 generally much higher service standards.   I'm 30.. first shot, bit tired, arm hurt. Slept night.

2nd shot, started kicking ass 12 hours so. Slept, woke feeling sluggish, like bad hangover. Took day work. Felt fine evening. Apparently revolt among group people (typically military, crew crew pirates) oppose, change, overthrow organization previously loyal. term commonly used rebellion among members military internal force, also sometimes mean type rebellion force. Mutiny necessarily need refer military force describe political, economic, power structure change power.  He's reserve officer cadet, hardly soldier. may even joined purpose.  Note addition 200 million doses already exported factories based EU, mainly Pfizer AstraZeneca. I'll give that, toddler little different. 2 even supposed wear masks. Feel good click bait stupid promotional contest. Pretty sure ad disguised news story. Bummed out. Left work yesterday surprising email company would allowing fully vaccinated employees go without masks would stickers issued corporate medical indicating vaccine status. morning two local sites sent email saying abide policy notice explanation indication timeline. emailed boss health coordinator ask decided update policy even get bullshit answer want indicate I’m happy refusing update policy. It’s utter BS. policy good one don’t understand management standing way vaccine numbers good cases low state. point care mask policy work writ large spend time work anywhere else. difficult Germany (or EU countries) close borders, inter-national roads unmanned, years.

Unfortunately - even though (UKs) borders theoretically much secure, we've still letting huge amount unnecessary travel basically entire past year. think number tests administered plummet soon everywhere. people vaccines also type people wouldn’t get tested unless sick. People would test often mostly vaccinated. Vaccinated people also longer required test upon exposure unless develop symptoms (which would rare). Finally, work places tested employees weekly don’t longer employees vaccinated. Wait hit Biden's goal 70% first doses hit would start. Probably need wear masks least one winter public well. private though, go nuts (if vaccinated). hard restrictive before. Wow, I'm surprised 6mo 12 years next group. would thought group would include fewer ages. 6 month olds tiny!!

^(context: I'm much parent) Testing decreasing Virginia, cases decreasing faster rate. really matter testing decreasing long test positivity decreases well. Cases sometimes experience lags, much less common lagging deaths.

I would say good sign even following days see bit course correction. even far trajectory Virginia on. Sure, accelerated percentage decrease, that's we've seeing across country. 

Here case counts previous Mondays: difference: -108 -275 -63 -197

Percent decrease: 15% 45% 19% 72% Right. boils convenience one group vs health safety another. tend default health safety cases.  found press release 05 may states way put it, find info?

I however also found press release 17 may says used untill longer declares COVID-19 pandemic. could take while... No. podcast unreliable source. guy said something interesting, post link that. involve Joe Rogan all? get butt hurt time someone mentions suck Joe Rogan dick like do? care someone thinks Rogan? point guest said, Rogan said, what's issue? First seem reddit long enough know basic etiquette revisions posts, particularly major edits (as evidences supporting arguments) traceable mysteriously deleted. creepy.

Good quoted original reply least still retained.

Second, heavily revised huge chuck reasoning like that, YET retained exact tone rebuttal. suggests heavily biased begin with. really give damn makes frank (your love China? Monetary reasons?), say longer credibility.... Sorry man Ditto! 11 year old didn’t make cut. Hoping soon! Everyone notify end December though. Also Xi told Trump ""very contagious"" personal call Feb. guess somehow predicted countries would sit ass 2 months? far end w/ 35-40% people anti-vaxxers refuse it. given virus constantly mutating, we'll new strain current vaccines less effective against.

We're forest yet. video explains efficacy pretty well, worth case we're talking specific groups though; people already notified separately. we're talking ""general population"" able move appointments.  I’ve noticed “mostly idiot” “totally idiot” acquaintances coworkers willing get j&amp;j.  thought reasoning pretty silly, unfounded, confusing. shut mouth went, “that’s awesome getting j&amp;j it’s great product” I'm anti mask I'm kids continuing wear masks next school year. Monica Ghandi Lucy McBride clear stance regarding this. huge benefit continued masking harm social development. People seem understand vaccinated adults help protect kids. 

I kid finish year masks thankfully required next year. Kids need normal we've gotten stuck safetyism lost sense risk.  look already covered responses, them? It’s like year work them. wear masks indefinitely? It’s officially undercounted, numbers responsibility state governments. It’s lot people don’t bother get tested let be. People saying ""Australia New Zealand islands likely catch disease colony far side moon"" following news here. Despite requiring incoming travelers quarantine, Australia leak every 12 days. 

And yet, still overrun covid. possible fake vax passport implemented Algorands blockchain! That's lot context. US high schools students 3+ months vaccine availability fall seem reasonable could relax mask mandates least vaccinated. 

Since feel strongly, would suggest writing school board, explaining mandate affects peers requesting students vaccination verified allowed go maskless.  Recoveries bullshit course. mechanism. subtract deaths total positive cases 14 days Could cases go again? Sure, probably clearly seasonal virus. However, framing things could see something comparable three big surges seen US past 14 months extremely pessimistic. 

We probably entire fall least 75% total population protected via either vaccination prior infection well seniors. Coupling fact second waves places like NY/NJ, protection heading via natural immunity likely closer 1/3rd, like 25% extreme respective first waves, seems almost impossible future outbreaks place significant stress medical system. comment idiotic. one said kids can't go out, still wearing shit. why, even though I'm vaccinated, taking toddler anywhere anytime soon since CDC lifted mask mandate. develop antibodies. That's bodies do. Texas cases dropped again, lowest positivity rate well.  Sadly, see lot “it’s flu” people feeling validated going, “I’ve saying year now!” insane. Talking policing restricting people's lives freedoms like nothing. I'm beyond shocked amount righteousness insensitivity sub, lack empathy astounding.  seriously think microchips? vaccines - came recently, AZ 60% effective, Pfizer 80% effective (or 85?) - prevent almost hospitalisations Indian variant (as well Kent, SA Brasil variants).  already working office whole time.

Was getting worried since work starting push us go back office soon. None beyond sore arm day. flu deadly, contagious widespread Covid? Flu vaccines also proven work immunocompromised. *Fewer* people getting tested.

It's people vaccinated get tested nearly much. Hypochondriacs testing every week vaccinated. think % vaccinated population needs 'ditch masks' regulatory/advisory level?  different. Emergency Use Authorization and, guessed it, issued emergency fda advisors believe benefits using outweigh risks. authorization given based less data required approval (in case, fda required least 2 months data least half fully vaccinated trial participants). trials continue (although believe unblinded placebo arm vaccinated well trial makeup/protocols changed now).

Full approval often takes years, even decade+ cases. It’s almost long-term efficacy safety (although less latter comes vaccines). I’ve seen quotes certain officials (I’m sorry can’t remember exactly, possibly Peter marks fda maybe somebody remembers step correct verify) case vaccines, it’s almost long work. means could perhaps see full approval fall (when verify work least full year). knowledge, Pfizer actually applied approval, I’m sure moderna j&amp;j aren’t far behind.

I’m sure way detail ins outs, think fair summary differences. Everyone get shot now.

This wrong.... consider one dose kids levels. lot side effects come second looks like overkill trials US, COVID going like gangbusters elsewhere world. anything timeline sufficient statistical power studies shorter. That's wrong. kids' benefit back school. one people think teachers glorified babysitters? Well low infection rates population probably got apathetic. Although eastern cultures tend handle infectious diseases better, inoculated spike numbers notable I'm guessing lot people careful deep pandemic. Amen!! Thanks part hope family comes around getting vaccinated. feel like ""wear masks forever"" thing straw man. 

Very people, any, *actually* saying mask mandates permanent, reached anywhere near herd immunity although seems weird ""Yay, Covid over! Mission accomplished!"" messaging going around, seven day average death-per-day rate US 650 yesterday. That's 4500 people week still dying covid. 

I get people feel done covid, think covid done us. Negotiating saving millions, every extra day lockdown costs billions smartest thing do...

The vaccines could cost €1000 per person, would still worth available 6 months ago... Masking could also long term psychological effects that, going outside moving around could incredibly detrimental childhood physical development. (Assuming age kid able go park). Upvote Media best show NPR.

The stuff whole ""must &lt;5 micron airborne"" thing linked back ancient studies TB really interesting. basically same, emergency approval requires less data course much quicker. However still thousands participants studies emergency authorization. 

We enough data full approval, after, know, 200 million people got it. guess probably biggest sample size vaccine ever fully approved, there's never emergency vaccine authorization scale. Pfizer already going full approval. That’s mentioned likelihood severe covid low well. people recover fine mild symptoms FWIW living former presidents received vaccine, one hasn’t public it. 

I’m fully vaxxed, trying best get family same. Let’s get with. actually break laws? Yeah exactly. Open things up. Go out, see people. require masks indoor situations keep testing chugging along, need actually restrict activities people anymore. Tell them, live America, Trump invented Pifzer vaccine. Maybe work? dangerous trend right towards trying spread misinformation mRNA vaccines try turn public opinion make room others approved yet. lurk groups related Covaxin/Ocugen amount fear nonsense people spreading Pfizer Moderna think convince people ini US hold Covaxin staggering delusion. 

I agree needs serious consequences people intentionally trying turn people away vaccines using lies manipulation. 70% guess experts also guessed 60%. Also 30% natural immunity makes path 60-80 much quicker easier, took lot deaths get there. Nope lmao New Zealand vaccine manufacturing capability always going rely international supply.

Australia planning producing supply vaccine even issues AZ would taken 40 weeks produce enough two doses population.

Australia plan vaccinating entire population using locally supplied vaccines went wrong. Australia queue pfizer vaccines like countries. 

But vaccinated matter cases deaths. essential rest world get vaccinated quickly possible life death situation. Australia argument soon people travel overseas bit less important. experience well. avoid AA United unless choice. end flying them, usually confirm previous experiences them. JetBlue gone way make things right (with minimal effort required me), Delta never dropped ball me, either. Naw,I want stay home lol Nope Correct wrong QR meant read authorized personnel, right? means reader ID server, name ID Berlin Heraklion airport hard figure at. Link? Sexist Sexist Sexist signing toddler trial? Damn that's crazy. Yeah expecting hit hard. Mostly tired, little dizzy bad headache now. Definitely fun haha. always infuriated ""lack genetic manipulation marker"" argument. people could possibly conceive world-class, bio research lab regularly might actually live animals captivity serve hosts...... really don’t see big deal wearing masks food store malls help protect other- outdoors maybe different story really big deal inside? Open indoor events- movies, bowling, everything full capacity- keep mask mandate going longer Science isn’t religion. don’t “trust science,” constantly question study. everyone “believes science,” would never make new discoveries. isn’t belief system way. Pulling kids *out* school initially deemed necessary reduce community spread older, vulnerable people. 

Putting kids back *in* school whole thing. lot people pushed kids' educational benefit, get national economy back gear. 

Implementation remote person learning been...ugh. Like, could go length (and have) suffice say lot studies used declare person learning 'safe' little...uh, look, using data schools 5% in-person learning extrapolating schools much higher person learning. Also, area, adjust anything protocol response new strains new information transmission (airborne vs surfaces). 

ALSO, one really gets me, can't talk transmission rates 'for kids school' single homogenous group. Transmission rates low elementary school aged kids, yes, older kids (middle high school) spread covid rates adults. 

Kids totally used pawns senses word: bargaining chips sacrifices. 

That's annoys much people casually say kids sacrifice convenience adults. be, know, *adults* it? early days knew suggested outbreak center blocks away lab China specifically works types viruses. Assuming anything release runaround thought. Especially came nowhere super strong human human transmission. Occam’s razor Yeah, lots parents worried long term I'm assuming drive kids new information good keep saying. makes incentive would get vaccine haven't, shames get it. Anything get needles arms.  here, 2 year old tested positive last week outbreak daycare makes sad kids left behind getting exposed. adults life vaccinated tested negative reinforces faith vaccines realize you’re giving vaccine virus killed less 300 0-17 year olds America correct...? Don’t count “we wait everyone gets boosters” coming resistance wanes early vaccinated people next year sort childish attempt gaslighting guess. said “forever-mask folks” “continue mask wearing”. 

Again, you’re good don’t want waste time someone trying intentionally gaslight someone losing grip reality. Regardless stand masks, lay employees time jobs cant filled seem like great business decision. Jesus christ beyond deluded. It’s two ends spectrum people zero ability assess risk. 

But record, yes, idiots refuse get vaccine worse. Maryland!  exceptionally bright, you? got friendly argument someone vaccines. said ""Why FDA approved"" really find answer FDA approval different Emergency FDA approval right? someone answer clarify emergency vs regular different? article summer next fall, right now. It’s never late read article! remove u/LRaziel1 comment Alaska nice. pay first class feel like I've never issues them, although fly Southwest I'm spoiled baggage fee 🥴 lab leak theory certain, definitely investigated rigorously taken seriously.

People dismissing outright. What? talking mask wearing.

Let ask again. even know arguing anymore? I’ve taking 1 year old parks long hikes bike rides every chance get. picnics, explore plants, watch animals bugs. also bring along vaccinated friends family can. 

But I’m definitely causing permanent damage denying life-altering experience walking aisles Walmart eating meal Olive Garden. fan Alaska Southwest? fly issues them, unlike carrier I've uncomfortably tight layovers despise. scientists pushing lab leak hypothesis forward today pushing forward publicly back Jan/Feb 2020, long Trump ever mentioned it. 

The media many prominent virologists claiming conspiracy censoring topic long Trump suggested it. 

The point is, never Trump, though become involved fact administration failed collect solid evidence lab leak hypothesis. 

That said, incorrect saying “all intelligence communities” claimed debunk it; never happened. Trump administration failed gather good evidence Biden administration continued fail gathering good evidence... neither administration *ever* stopped regarding plausible hypothesis many countries agreed, including Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, European countries, etc. 

Not everything revolve around Trump. worry already blocked going link  absolutely urging children continue mask wearing. many urging adults continue mask wearing well. sound confident something isn’t even true, thinking know thoughts are.

Then try strawman someone wants wait zero cases. You’re good this. opinion continue indoor masking kids vaccinated sept. hard. go, guy Nova also drives people indoors. Flu goes away easier contagious resistant population.

If remember summer H1N1 appeared 2009, filling hospitals summer population immunity.  understand agreeing wholeheartedly. I'm saying tragic that's route that's taken. voted Biden voted Biden primary lol ""I'm immunocompromised I've never gotten flu lol""

Science. Yes, planes, trains, automobiles, airports, train terminals. Outside automobile, rest examples easily places Covid would spread extremely. 

Airports, planes, trains, enclosed places thousands people possibly dozen plus close proximity find seat. 

Lack evidence evidence. That’s precisely lab leak theory shouldn’t dismissed outright? shouldn’t taken fact it’s dismissed outright. 

People jumping logical hoops trying disprove it. Thank great parent trusting science &lt;3 hopefully see approval soon 11 year old's there!!  Gross. clearly saying much worse outcome, leave immune population. pointing lot people died make point vaccine better choice. always people can’t get vaccinated health reasons. argument you’re getting “wear mask forever” territory. may disagree stance, appreciate people openly say they’d prefer mask permanent norm, rather try figure end date people still dropping mask insist they’ll eventually find acceptable. president, Dr. Fauci, + two hundred million others received it. They've done rigorous studies proving safe highly effective protecting covid-19. mRNA vaccines go one greatest medical advancements time, big reason pandemic US ending fast is. trials check current mRNA vaccines used children aged 0 11 years old ? No, don’t even know one live getting blocked troll spreading misinformation like it’s mother J&amp;J works preventing *most* (not all) infection nearly 100% effective preventing death hospitalization. actually caught covid post J&amp;J sniffles way inconvenienced isolation illness. J&amp;J fine vaccine accomplishes goal inoculating covid19.

I've taken Pandemic seriously already social distancing Feb. 2020. worries vaccine developed fast governments prioritizing economy people. 

I think everyone breaking point self-isolation finally started work courage April. point, researched three vaccines in-depth decided Pfizer lower chance side effects. used vaccine spotter tools finally grab appointment Pfizer day first dose, J&amp;J pause happened panicked/canceled. 

In order combat anticipatory anxiety, decided wait walk-ins became thing. way day decided ready, could go it. city organized giant vaccine drive-thru 3 vaccines. day finally decided ready, drove vaccination site told holding Pfizer back kids. spent agonizing 20 minutes car trying decide do. felt like never. knew Moderna higher chance side effects anxiety, J&amp;J, probably would thought every little thing blood clot. went Moderna.

I ton side effects felt pretty crummy first 72 hours. arm felt fine first 4 hours sore tender. trouble putting shirts exercising arm extremely painful. fatigued. trouble sitting desk focusing work. would lay bed listen podcasts. tried going walk day 1 day 2 vaccine nearly fainted time. Best way describe like trying go walk fever. 

Either day 1 day 2 post vaccine also woke extreme lower back pain. already bad back, hard tell slept wrong vaccine. weird thing lower back pain would come go. saw people's stories lower back pain Pfizer Moderna, definitely think vaccine. 

Once regained mobility arm, also noticed armpit tenderness documented even Moderna's FDA briefing. I'm 9 days post vaccination feel ~ 95% back normal. wow feel like long 9 days. I'm conflicted getting second dose since first supposed least 80% effective, higher J&amp;J. Everyone says second dose worse, I'm thinking went times ten.

I'm writing fear monger Moderna. I'm glad least 1 dose protection. guess response Moderna (I sore arm) people saying overdoing it. look Moderna clinical trials, 7% decided get second dose ""unknown reasons"". actually widely supported population. They're really rush open borders. I'm curious reason believe kids susceptible Kawasaki disease might also susceptible MIS-C?

Remember, took lot real world data come Pfizer, approved 3 months J&amp;J. give enough time actual 8 weeks pass, enough time see adequate number infections, enough time compile/edit data, enough time peer review, enough time account things like 2 week pause. well, J&amp;J used much. 10 million doses believe.

And unfortunately low incidence counts trials enough sway, ""there 0 chance"" feel okay it, think. scientific language like ""We reason believe X"", instead ""We 100% confident 0% chance X"".

And even ex, still wants wait 16 year old get vaccine see people react? Seriously? We're selling them. We're allowing exported outside EU, unlike places. Actually, two subgroups within 5-11 study evaluating safety, tolerability, immunogenicity Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine two-dose schedule (approximately 21 days apart) three age groups: children aged 5 11 years, 2 5 years, 6 months 2 years. 5 11 year-old cohort started dosing last week companies plan initiate 2 5 year-old cohort next week.  Good point. wish discussion surrounding topic wasn’t heavily censored last year.

There huge demand 12-15 high risk. lot parents prefer wait see. think headlines heart problems going help this. teens vaccinated. would best we're going get? We're still seeing close million first vaccine doses administered *a day*. That's almost another 10% whole eligible population first shot month - we're talking second shots here, even higher that.

Can someone help here? Im feeling anxious messed vaccination. underestimate dedication indoctrinated cult member. 60% already 1 dose. would think 50% fully vaccinated limit? I’d imagine people get second dose. Clinical trials conducted kids 6 months 11 years. completed sometime fall. see can't commit protecting chance take vaccine. forever. glad someone math here. claiming anywhere 600k 1.6mil dead.

I tad reservation methodology. using IFR US, likely applicable India due large difference median age two countries.

Finally... really think they're going let easy? That's really important question avoiding. Well... that’s logical fallacy ever see one. said one threads before...

If want get vaxxed, least LITTLE understandable. bodies can't handle new vaccine companies. say want get vaxxes also want wear masks also want isolate wnat anything close point pro covid Well yeah I’m probably gonna person thread actually knew talking said kuzy hear last sentence.

YKMMV. Lol... always idiots said shit. cares them... Still plenty idiots believe virus hoax. anti-vaxxers w/ 5G theory.

Yep.. people. CDC:

Differences: 
The risk complications healthy children higher flu compared COVID-19. However, infants children underlying medical conditions increased risk flu COVID-19. Probably FUD least couple months kids get vaccinated. Schools one places virtually one vaccinated. first talking people wanted total lockdown, few. you’re conflating people want bit careful likely don’t want lock down. Make mind. get it.

You're using pretty dramatic language though. May ask why? far know, everyone know wants mRNA ones. Ontario 2nd dose roll select groups followed date 1st dose, respective health units contacted individuals reschedule 2nd dose. There's much rebuttal given honestly sides 100% correct. done blue too. Wonder work, hope stuck around 50% currently (vaccinated + registered). agree, want avoid disappointing myself. think right ""the 2021-22 school year going 100% normal!"" I'm factoring admittedly small, significant chance masks still remain required. Wow can't buy live chickens there? dies? feel either less people getting tested there’s lag data daily covid cases..

In Virginia yesterday says 76 cases..and normally Lows week 200s week went I’d back 400-500s.

Is good sign likely lag data? Unfortunately think that's what'll happen they're vaccinated, even though definitely need vaccinate children end pandemic. first jab (AZ) March 10th supposed second one? Yes, efficacy matter? still unclear J&amp;J compares mRNA. harmed person wearing mask outside will. really hate wearing shirts swimming pool, get pissed people it. Yeah, said eligible week next, fair, think leave house much. still...  Regarding 1/100,000 case fraction, I'm concerned going happen they'll point fall winter (non-alarming due vaccines) increase cases, panic kids vaccinated, call tightened restrictions.   hope entire article filled words like ""could"" ""might"". words, opinion piece guy guessing. he's even doctor / research scientist.

He uses ""could"" 11 times haha. puff piece meet quota. look definition word anecdotal ...  Kids need able see other's facial expressions learn social.

I’d love able go *anything* family. supposedly gold standard covid response can't get testing act together whole year... I'm anti mask. wore mask abided mandates. However, amount union influence state live, I'm going bet they'll push continued mask usage fall, possibly beyond.

I follow rules faithfully, unfathomable I'll likely wear mask next school year even though we're making incredible progress vaccinations. I'm high school, we're definitely going held back ""because kids vaccinated."" actually think India’s case count accurate, least terms trending. However, find India’s counting recoveries past couple weeks little suspect. Agreed. live Tennessee. wouldn’t believe covid deniers anti-vaxxers encounter. guess I’m little guarded speak. say long term risks find people get hang nails six months out, folks would throw face proof I’m stupid taking vax trying get others consider it.

I’ll stick statistically unlikely.  who? lock I’m 24F, first shot 12-14 hours later fatigue moderate headache, fine next day. took nap. 5 days later muscle aches working felt odd. maybe that’s even vaccine related. None really impacted much

My boyfriend also 24 got Pfizer also side effects, sister (28) side effects first second shot, husband (29) also side effects except sore arm first shot. 
And woman, watch peroid vaccine, many people it’s intense (heavy, lasts longer, painful) me. I’m bit worried cycle second shot today..but it’ll worth it! wants us total lockdown? 

name one person, thanks Who’s we? actually allowed love whipped didnt? people fully vaccinated wearing masks outside? People advocating social distancing continue businesses restrict number people allowed in? Plenty people sub still pushing additional 4-6 weeks let people get fully vaccinated. proper Western headline would ""AMIST MASSIVE OUTBREAK ^china ^is ^doing ^a ^fuckload ^of ^vaccinations OPPRESSING PEOPLE FORCING VACCINATE"" Maybe read article? believe Dr. Facebook Dr. Fauci.

They've open since March UK, involves Joe Rogan interesting thing said.....was Joe Rogan. isn’t issue I’m butt hurt. Lol Lol people don’t *actually* get choose work. take they’re offered. Ohio helped increase vaccinations pretty significantly. legislature trying stop “vax-a-million” tho. reasons 🤷‍♂️ disagree, there's historical context much complicates this. 654 today's numbers. 76 yesterday's.

They've fewer restrictions countries. reopen border, extremely long lockdown and/or massive hospitalizations death, especially given almost natural immunity. makes sense wait long can. two diseases eradicated. highly doubt Covid added list. Girls usually care ball size 10% week much faster rate age group. urgency clearly there. one get mild covid Fosun literally funded helped development vaccine big time? lol literally heard I'm due second shot today....great. I'm 26. IIRC announcement last year saying wipe phone Clorox wipes. figured wipe phone/other accessories wash hands handling instead hard believe December year ago already. seems like ward frail patients unlikely surprise. sounds like really interesting guy. Probably ""full FDA approval"" silly benchmark; others mentioned, EUA already implies safe, full approval long term efficacy. Yeah US exponential decay case numbers. 2/3 adults partially vaccinated another 30-40% Americans recovered potentially. huge swath Americans living rural communities covid basically longer present, 2/3 chance anyone coming town least partially vaccinated. find hard argue strict regulations cases falling though. cases fall harder harder argument make. We've let restrictions metrics still keep falling.  theory like unions hate employees taken advantage of, teacher's unions absolutely failed students year. shame. Ah, agreed Yes, possibility strongest theory. theory however deteriorates continue search origin continue come empty. 

That continue strongest case development occurs lab leak theory front. 

None said though, damage lab leak theory. Oh bless heart. Huh? I'm one tens thousands women vaccine trials. Whenever I'm lab see people every gender, color, age, shape size. trials studying white males. settle ok 81 take pick ailments jfc Would nice would study co-morbidities breakthrough cases common with.

Well, got extra year. distinguish things brains use them. vaccinated Croatia completely open summer! wait 1st June information, think won’t even need rapid test enter. ones who've yet get vaccine, yet get Covid.  Contracts matter, that's EU suing AZ - breach contract. 

Pfizer Moderna American companies, J&amp;J using production facilities export vaccines. know EU owned Pfizer's facilities. Imagine ok even wanting country lol April 30, 2021, approximately 101 million persons United States fully vaccinated COVID-19. total 10,262 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections reported 46 U.S. states territories April 30, 2021. 

Among cases, 6,446 (63%) occurred females, median patient age 58 years (interquartile range = 40–74 years). Based preliminary data, 2,725 (27%) vaccine breakthrough infections asymptomatic, 

995 (10%) patients known hospitalized, 160 (2%) patients died. Among 995 hospitalized patients, 289 (29%) asymptomatic hospitalized reason unrelated COVID-19. median age patients died 82 years (interquartile range = 71–89 years); 28 (18%) decedents asymptomatic died cause unrelated COVID-19. Yeah, people sub fucking ridiculous airborne spread issue ""so obvious"" simply case. knew R0 rate much lower properly ""airborne"" virus like polio chicken pox. also knew surface area proportional square root volume concentrations surfaces *should* order magnitude higher - even case could transmit air, surfaces/droplet route bad worse.
 
It took reworking underlying physics aerosols heaping dose novel epidemiology... virus clearly behaves different respiratory viruses, took science get there. 
 
But people saying ""I knew whole time, obvious."" Congrats - took guess got lucky. Fortunately us that's rigorous science. Fully vaccinated Pfizer now, originally looking J&amp;J life complete chaos idea schedule second shot idea life would look like one day next paralyzing. wanted vaccine, since historically awful reactions everything Novocain MMR boosters, felt like ultimate disloyalty potentially bad reaction needed best. stressed exhausted terrified anything make worse.

And universe forgot keep kicking face minute made appointment mRNA vaccine! even bad reaction - felt garbagey next day, nothing like high fevers bodyaches get everything else (I sensitivity preservatives.) relieved Pfizer fully vaccinated, felt kind pinned life, J&amp;J looked like best option protect complicate life even more. 2-11 y/o get approval year end US, newborn doubt it'll time soon all. Whatever makes one feel happy safe wonder asymptomatic cases Hold us back? technically ahead us. twice would make one think there's many antibodies produced people. GDPR exemption's are
-Personal household activities
-Law Enforcement
-National Security

And creative enough say, pandamic intrest national security inform you. anyone else wearing mask. guess block vaccinated previously infected. thought Israel's vaccine program include vaccinated previously infected treated same. didnt get lucky Sam Adam's Budweiser either, got free donuts, though, get entered lottery coming weeks state irons out.

And got entered free flights. 

Plenty ""free shit"" it, one them, lord knows decided say ""fuck me.""

Actually, everyone knows why. reading article commenting hard some. Thats good news That's disingenuous suggest people lazy, rather tests take. Australia currently vulnerable position virtually immunity population either vaccines disease.

And make matters worse, strains dominating days dangerous population low immunity original one year ago.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Lost doses (cumulative): 5,558 keep telling zero evidence bud death. parent, real lifelong complications surprise event hospital trip find 3 year old fact high risk things worried thanks.   anyone seen anything new recently allowing vaccinated people third countries in? That’s I’m holding breath for, I’m hoping it’ll go along this. Feeding straight government problem part.  safety immunogenic results great, maybe even better adults. think it’s likely EMA approves. like selling candy corn contracts matter. middle global pandemic, thing matters production capabilities. EU willing share them, entities not. 
Why private companies US sell part capacity bang free market shit? Maybe next best thing compare wartime economy, production claimed country only.

So sick hearing crap ppl ignoring situation pointing orders contracts, whole ignoring circumstances. He's even that, he's officer cadets. Lower reservists. made speech uniform big army matter are.   anti masker don’t wear mask anymore? Edgy  That's thing, though: literally way execute military strike place China without getting ass kicked.

Are talking flying bomber plane drone alllll way past China's borders avoiding Air Force? want send team commandos would crawl across border, Wuhan, blow lab crawl back?

Those childish fantasies, they'd impossible execute. We've spikes NJ, last long. Friday next friday last restrictions going door, back normal essentially.  shows bad participation need hand money…

the issue really gov made masks outside required anymore nobody nowhere wears mask it’s officially over. even though lot restrictions still up, nobody really gives crap all. even see full busses packed people without masks… they’re asking next wave government police looks shrugging looking away. vaccinated mother 9 month old daughter newly lifted mask mandates vaccinated people (unvaccinated people likely unmasked public well), wondering daughter could potentially vaccinated. Anyone insight could be? Nobody's freedom threatened. violated policy organization works for, he's facing consequences like employment. 

Do try frame ""threatening people's freedoms"", way mark. exercise freedom something dumb, organization conducted investigation reviewed disciplinary measures PER POLICY LEGAL perhaps quite surprising considering much variation symptom severity. entirely possible original infections spread quietly among children young people reaching vulnerable population. mean, fair share shit units dirt bags think ""reservist"" shifted ton past 20 years. harder claim one weekend, many important things country.

I trying attack there, anger guy thread paired cadet shitbag reservist reason folly, figure I'd comment here. I'm fine called ""weekend warrior"" endearment. I'm fine called POG. I'm okay people use couple bad apples justification say reservists cutting soldiers they're sham one weekend month reservists valuable. amount missions tasks do, whether responding hurricane something lame cleaning toilet, there's gonna reservist point that.

And sure, sometimes reservists get cool guy shit, sometimes don't, get shit details. that's military, ain't it? Thx info. Makes sense internationally funded academic research lab, like super-secret military facility anything. Ugh yes. store yesterday line behind another customer cashier, unmasked, one saying thought she’d Covid Jan 2020, thought she’d March 2020. used didn’t need wear masks get vaccine. thought head going pop off. try avoid bringing kids anywhere indoors- bad faith actors don’t understand isn’t chicken pox. Thanks, really hope so. I'll get July that's hit lowest age requirement Pfizer, I'd like get next month Oh gosh sorry hear bud. Yeah everyone memory cells remember viruses come contact with. even longer antibodies within you, mean susceptible getting second time. Doesn’t mean it’s impossible mean it’s unlikely.   exciting news world It’s fucking mask. That’s all. big problem? That's hope expect.

I expect he'll get slap wrist sentence maybe 6 months prison system maybe lose pension. definitely veteran status recognized officially. study involving people willing reinfected let know. Otherwise, 11 months may beginning longitudinal study hardly conclusive given stakes. bet lot happen school starts fall Right?? 2 weeks taking mask I'm flu. Honest God, flu 10 damned years. I'm recovering geez. Ok. So, also know soon reconnect phone it'll send heaps data offline (on levels)? Connected wifi ever? ISP knows you. know VPN still goes ISP get out, right? KNOWS connected, know doing. ISPs track TON info despite ""opting out"". But, still, FULLY PRIVATE. Blocking trackers? Sure, get enough ""generic"" info pretty easily identified. errant ones care completely negate ""private"" sessions trying use. argument ""use phone like paperweight! HA GET THEM!!!"" Sure, use technology phone, otherwise accept LEVEL ""intrusion"" way around it. logic applies vaccines: want EXIST society? Get fear. fair headline really India, agree. Nah. walk. even drive tons safety precautions regulations involved driving. argument stupid. There's nothing wrong people wearing masks fact guys get angry people insane. Literally insane. Y'all need get heads checked. FTFY: People misinformed bribed take safe effective vaccine.  Liberate Michigan I'm familiar Canadian Army, officer training? Honestly I'm kind surprised he's even charged, immediately dismissed military?  Like Scouts.  4 thousand seems pretty small begin with. lil sister 12 I'm sure rush get vaxxed. dunno.

An influencer, someone makes kind living posting reputation claims offered paid express certain point view. Well does, right? use certain moisturizer best?

He posts increases views popularity. Again, that's does. told misinformation supposed spread is. Implicitly, fact believes false. ""We [influencers] responsibility, audiences manipulate - like not.""

And exactly doing. reported one year? They're going pissed get covid treatment stops getting covered free. May even less since wartime, although part wanted Trudeau enact Emergencies Act. Outcomes exist alive dead. keep dreaming seen rhetoric around lately? “Mask mandates don’t matter anymore kids low risk COVID adults get vaccine.” Read whole piece. point expected antibodies fall low levels, body retains ability ramp production antibodies later time. 79% people looked at, found antibody-producing cells blood marrow. Cells typically stick around - many year, possibly lifelong. would think given FDA authorization EMA highly likely authorize well.  Worthy investigation = worth considering?

If it’s nothing worry even investigate? don’t even make sense. Don’t try change meanings words. Kantei twitter account good translate tweet Come US?? We're swimming vaccine, taking walkins running arms put needles in. Dude, hard people like admit NZ &amp; Australia fucked vaccine procurements? completely undeniable fact.

No one denying countries handled brilliantly pandemic saved lot lives strategy compared Europe US, they've completely incompetent securing doses time organising mass vaccine roll out. That's it, period. like UK opposite fucked handling pandemic brilliantly vaccine roll out. insane increasing number idiots see refusing get vaccine.... even crazier idiots think vaccines make contagious with... something?? Lol get here? would important part. could disable GPS phone even decompile app dig suspicious code control scanning device logging. Still address Covid deadly, contagious widespread flu. immunocompromised person never wore mask pandemic, never got flu once. Flu vaccines prevent symptoms immunocompromised, certainly prevents severe illness patients. Vaccinated Immunocompromised people still sent hospital Covid. Source? John Hopkins Vaccine study bit surprised state, Iowa, one states. mean knew daily cases calming recent weeks never thought would hit 50% mark perhaps later summer. idea vaccine certificates work EU US literally printed notecard someone writes name vaccine got batch number well name. signatures card, anti-piracy features. could print home computer bout 10 seconds card stock could buy Wal-mart office supply store. I've heard anecdotal stories people got vaccine cards even card stock, regular old 8x10 paper. Absurdly easy forge inclined so. exactly thing part joke? Let know what? already know happens viruses too, using extremely moderated language without histrionics around it. ""Although children COVID-19 severe disease, study shows may effects SARS-CoV-2 worthy investigation"". language milquetoast panic-free scientist doctor.

Do even know arguing anymore? k-12. sorry gotta deal that. saying virus back October 2019. came horribly sick trouble breathing lungs felt like fire. loss taste smell everyday coughed large chunks phlegm. every test done one could diagnose had. doctor put bronchitis. Ever since use maintenance inhaler breath properly. I'm convinced virus back then, although US believe first documented case December earliest. I've saying possible longer really know China telling world it. Ah yes, important “going Target” phase child development. what? he's punished refusing encouraging others job order alleviate health crisis. see problem this, equate communism? god dense. 100%? That's amazing!!!!!!! They're smart yet stupid time.  sure bad day grudge Chinese government. Regardless which, free independently present verify facts welcomed make correction necessary. mean promos ads...  problem! make sure stay hydrated. sure made difference us, husband pounded Gatorade day day felt fine. welcome. Overall, terrible.. annoying mostly. fine prepare bit useless next day. anyone — people 12 over. article people 12 punished antivaxxers vaccinated people impatient comfortable faces. Nice see sex scandal least. Must higher ranks that. see pockets Reddit still thread filled people legitimately think life danger you’re vaccinated inside.  recent article studies f giving pfizer astra zeneca amplifying immune response. Jnj adenovirus type vaccine like astra zeneca. long jnj shot for? medical advice five, six months jnj probably fine get mrna vaccine boost. Yeah live Trump literally said evidence came lab last year 


The ENTIRE mainstream media many others including Fauci said baseless conspiracy theory can't discussed.

The big joke Trump know intelligence agencies debunked it. But, mRNA vaccine isn’t virus based doesn’t contain virus particles, makes different. adjuvants causing myocarditis spike protein fragments? yeah parents literally rights. kids able get emancipation.

I think we'll agree disagree this. particularly strong feelings direction would want take this. child go road emancipation wrong reasons (as in: let whatever f*k want) even tried get us trouble CPS claiming abuse (which true) course went where. take current occupation jail cell evidence enough child always know best. Fuck, kids allowed sue alimony. ... parents endangering kids like that, wages garnished given kids rest lives.

And this... suggesting build system whereby children could simply claim lifelong support parent never achieve sort independence own. Parental abuse happens dealt course, child needs fate point start taking responsibility. Without that, unhappy lifetime failure result; I've seen enough examples sure it. die

Only said that, troll. Olympics still on? Bad news sells half got COVID winter. Holy fuck scary time.  You’re one see saying that. fact you’re one exactly you’re saying. We’re saying don’t know could possibly lab you’re screeching idea conspiracy people crazy thinking it’s completely logical realistic possibility. realize military right? He's refusing lawful order duty inciting others same. basically definition mutiny. link article change camps specifically? Haven’t heard anything yet, I’m NY Would vaccinated local doctors unreasonable 

Oh well one said deserves die. Fucking idiotic strawman ~~2 weeks~~ 
~~We wait hospitals overwhelmed~~ 
~~We wait vulnerable access vaccine~~ 
~~We wait everyone wants shot get it~~ 
~~OMG variants~~ 
~~We wait case death numbers dropping~~ 
~~OMG variants~~ 
But kids immunocompromised! **&lt;&lt;&lt;---- Here** 
We wait reach herd immunity 
We wait zero Covid cases 
Masks forever case variant less. Divergence test placebo groups happened around days 12-15 phase 3 trials.

Here studies; Figure 3 outlines prevalence infection test placebo groups: also don’t enough evidence say sure Bigfoot didn’t engineer virus Pacific Northwest kill humanity.

It’s likely, ... gives message "" Xxxxx, .... "" threat obey right-think.

'The enemy forces closing capital. Colonel, use regiment attempt delaying action right flank, need give civilians time ecacuate.'

To colonel goes comms station proclaims anyone listening:

'I’m asking military, right serving, truck drivers, medical, engineers, whatever are, take unlawful order preparing delaying action.'

And expect military do? Shrug charge man mutiny? surprising JBS, big outbreak Cache Valley, Utah JBS plant. mean Arrested Development? bonkers Marx doesn’t much say race. please let doctors know then, random internet commenter. people I’ve spoken say fear alter DNA. Every time tried give good counter argument, would eventually go assume talk people. repeat thing next week.

The majority ended getting Pfizer, least one still holding out. terrified getting virus, really don’t know say anymore. Belarus.  ehhhh... disagree. Delta class domestic airlines, dear lord American awful...  much cautious testing children. Since bodies change pretty rapidly things could affect don’t affect slightly older children. pretty clear line pre-pubescent post-pubescent, hence 12-year-old cutoff Lol lucky live state unions omnipotent. I'd love trade places time. Heaven things go did. wouldn’t worry then, right? harming child actions, cause long lasting damage development. Go it. Well province  sore arm seems one common denominator across everyone’s shots! That’s cool though man, thanks sharing. 

Glad passed without much issue you! use google, search “va covid cases” first thing comes chart cases, think 654 yesterday? Maybe 76 cases Sunday? bad! Either way still asking general question. Kinda bummed tho seeing 600 number.. curious, part change policy interested in? able go without mask work sticker people would wear?

I'm vaccinated thankfully fully remote now, would hate wear mask work office. people wearing sticker seems awkward might create office division needed. device device that's reading QR requesting information, control device. Panda roll cookie? rate death complications indeed lower flu.

Of course manically terrified even want hear that. also powerfully effective adults. What’s stopping you? Absolutely wrong. Stop making shit up.

The flu vaccine protects immunocompromised hospitalization 1/8th rate average adult. That's actually much worse initial data Covid among immunocompromised vs. nonimmunocompromised adults lower **5%** (–29% 31%) vs. **41%** (27% 52%) (P &lt; .05 interaction term). right. *will* wear masks. *fact!* I'm going strong try let bog next year.  people privacy, spend want. want blow fb apple that's problem, walk home work whatever glance house 2 kids smoking joints go running police respect privacy house."
