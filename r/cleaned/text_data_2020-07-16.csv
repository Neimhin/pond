Again, lot white people get killed absolute numbers. seen massively disturbing videos years. see cops nowhere near person holding knife one around get mowed down. needs stricter rules, harsher punishments. still, cops tomorrow, anarchy. Every dispute settled force. be. NY doesn‚Äôt look like much success story despite lockdown. Maybe achieved herd immunity. try, happen theres way get another one Somewhat unrelated hate headlines like this. ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù. Russia who? Government officials? It‚Äôs like Russia colluding commit crime. may seem petty complaint it‚Äôs thinking like turn entire populations feeling like enemy. Makes large scale war justified guess?

Car crashes neither CONTAGIOUS systemic. daily numbers always fluctuate. best look 7 day moving average since gives clearer picture whether deaths rising decreasing. I'm encouraging people use mask day / every day. demonstrating problem much immediate gloves.

An overused mask eventually becomes hazard.

Gloves become hazard *almost immediately*.

Bio suits realistic. allowed wear one afford it, mandating fair people cannot. 

\---

Also, maybe led this... looking countries success, see masks alone enough. We've already done experiment gotten result. Masks work. Orange County (winter garden) - OC mandated masks stores while. Everyone wears them. wearing chinstraps either. like five cities NM hospitals. WTF Yes. seems like pointless attack done purpose. purpose convince others Putin really, really wants vaccine cure really already one. WW2 last war actual ‚Äúheroes‚Äù. Oh no, football! move forward society? /s crazy idea... you‚Äôre average person isn‚Äôt 2 metres tall absolutely jacked, BMI applies you. average person isn‚Äôt walking around looking like Phil fucking Heath.

Unlikely.

At least hope can‚Äôt. Reads like Robertson wants school kids compulsory [COVID-19 party, similar pox dont tell live That‚Äôs really good idea. like laundry bag idea. Boomers idea use social media / internet. rotting brains. us grew internet, know filter non-sense decent degree, laugh stupid BS probably made high-school drop out. boomer, man ever naive gullible internet.. multiple reporting periods combined one. know ivermectin study you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs widely discussed. definitely not. Disaster now. thought heard Oxford priority UK developing nations. Canadian, hope that‚Äôs strictly true (Juno beach etc) guy cold mofo FAUCI PREZ. care year, gotta happen. bullshit, politics, facts. Love him. read that! It'll take weeks realize people still dying apparently. Trump lies lies head stupid, idiotic ideas really think trying convince persuade people cause? deflecting something, covering wrong-doing causing controversy purpose? lol thought Lol MyFitnessPal best friend comes weight loss :) able eat want sometimes still staying within calorie deficit one going stop them. young would flee country sane one values citizens late. can't that, see happens next election guess. closed number cases still skyrocketing. Would‚Äôve better keep everything open tbh!! poor person gold! ü•á Arizona‚Äôs Gary Busey would like word...

Maybe always suggested, became recommended? heard wrong.

Thanks first hand information! Remember back day White House throwing accusations left right fake numbers. days tell ya. almost don‚Äôt think will. He‚Äôs doubled hard would take act god make change mind. Yeah believe China. truth World War Karen coming soon.  mention, many insurance plans cover things ""local"" you. Forget flight bill, cost six weeks out-of-coverage-range ICU stay really kill you.

My insurance covers New England, requires *pre-approval* *emergencies* outside coverage range. Oh, get office open M-F 8am-3pm. Fun story, emergency happened 2:45pm Friday *did* call way ER, longer anyone office Friday afternoon appealed bill told called accident happened. get approval per incident. asking know accident happened would need ER care accident. 2021 still possibility right? ain't wrong though could well cases much higher back mean testing straight atrocious back then. almost certain cases far higher

secondly deaths lag. deaths lag 2-4 weeks ago. deaths 70k cases we‚Äôll know within weeks.

another factor getting infected. elderly get infected death toll horrific whereas it‚Äôs mainly younger people getting infected time death toll hopefully won‚Äôt bad questioned presser afternoon, Ducey punted question 14 refrigerated trucks ordered store extra bodies stating something effect trend looking good.

Heads sand. Well compared peers northern Europe Scandinavia particular author able üçí pick. really believe that, paying attention what's going since 70s. thing social media done accelerate going end up. Co worker mine works real mental gymnastics. 

Covid bad, must careful public(we travel work) must wear mask even state doesnt require it(I'm happy coworker wears mask once...) says stuff like ""shit absolutely want get virus"" later day talks everyone go coronavirus parties everyone gets stuff over...

""The virus isnt even bad, affects old people""(dudes heavy smoker 40s....) 

""The libruls let trump shut country start like rest world look now""(wow...)

""The fucking libruls want keep going get mail voting. that's virus about, want mail voting""

He watches tucker nightly hope this. son summer school big difference he's regards teacher engagement online. could teacher though. Thanks links! He's due get fired now. run president. pandemic going make ""boomer vs millenials"" generation gap even wider. Old people resent anyone 30, sorts accusations helping.

Does negative re-enforcement even work trying get someone *NOT* something? one giving generation practical advice, everyone shitting us Moderna mutants *Definitely want pay anything definitely pay road hungry desperate approach homes. American headline I‚Äôve read bit...

*To hell deaths, football?* Petri dish Ocean. IO Well freaked 5501 cases (just looked SACOVID website). even 691 new cases today Bexar county getting control!

I've go out, I've seen people mostly well go bars restaurant stuff delivered can't attest that. *cops shoot kill black man walking street*

he following rules!

*trumper forced leave store wearing mask*

this infringing upon rights! Parent fully support schools reopening! 20 countries done it, figure too! I'm confused. watched Walmart video website, stated employees customers must wear masks use social distancing, CEO walked around showing us stickers show people wait distancing, plastic separators protect customer employee other, sanitizing carts spray, providing disinfectant wipes carts. I'm sure else ask Walmart beyond closing (and think that's right now).

The video taken Bible belt state, forget one, maybe Alabama?

I'm trying jerk, want prevent people turned away bringing mask them. eat ass Im married it‚Äôs safe wife I‚Äôll allready anyways eating stripper ass rowdy AF.  problem going longer ""solution."" got $200/week normal, hours reduced farther future benefit ends. put savings weeks ends.

Also, country underpaid begin with. would like thank state Florida Governor, Rona DeathSentence, contributing make happen. hope parasitic oligarch bastards dragged street end this. hardest hit states right people waiting 2 weeks results, $1000 month would enable hire tutor teach kindergartner mom work full time....

Like can't even begin figure we're suppose schooling without one us taking reduced hours... felony bit extreme; taking away someone's ability vote whole worms plus plug judicial system hard would take years clear cases. Perhaps not-insignificant fine (if would *actually* enforced) would force people wear masks. know I'll downvoted saying this, no. Unemployment roof people losing life savings. People need able work, society needs able run. **You can't endlessly print money, solves nothing.**

This biggest consolidation wealth US history, potentially human history.

The stock market high trillions dollars bailouts corporations rich people. already derailed gravy train comes crashing halt, stock market going crash too. obscenely rich people given tax dollars literally reason buy cheap stocks assets firesale prices.

Since unemployment sky high homelessness epidemic, wages going fall sharply. Labor buyer's market now. Literally nobody already multi-millionaire coming shit anything wage slave.

Get ready mad max shit, cause 21st century get fucking brutal. It‚Äôs shame ‚Äútold dumb motherfucker üñïüò∑üñï‚Äù ineffective.   Yep, best logic ‚ÄúAmerican government bad must mean American companies products bad‚Äù going start seeing FAUCI 2020? getting getting still good. Uk us worried there. ole Boris trying sentence millions death herd immunity. can‚Äôt really compare anyone absolute clusterfuck that‚Äôs happening US. It‚Äôs play cricket. ...are migrant caravan? What‚Äôs ‚Äúbaglog‚Äù? know ‚Äúbacklog‚Äù is. can't right 100% time. would speaking German true mean yeah nothing needs happen happen. Federl mask mandate happen shuting realistic option anymore.

Mitigation real play left now. Probably not. states blowing right already testing severe symptoms. top that, 5 hour lines guarantees less severe symptoms going bail go home. Couple things major ones. 

One. He‚Äôs proven complete idiot narcissist. reason convinced would become presidential became president. Dumb. 

Two. **was** small business owner sick Obama regulation administration. Pretty tough satisfying requirements Obamacare you‚Äôre requirements. 

Three. handling coronavirus pathetic. stopped watching news last election happened. didn‚Äôt fully realize much idiot March. It‚Äôs tough lesson wasn‚Äôt learned crisis N.Y. metro area. say. people need see death within communities believe. Even worse need see freezer morgue trucks things become reality. death rate current generation's caseload shy 1,100 week. locked 2 weeks growth well.

Bodies going start piling up. know new treatment regiments compared NY? hospital mid april pericarditis, full month covid test came back negative. two weeks bloodclot leg. totalled 6 times 5 months.

I'm still thinners still feel like shit. say can't get twice, seem unlikely given sort time frame.

I'm almost certain survive second hit right now.. I‚Äôm still firm believer testing=no coronavirus Mask protests special kind stupid. Europe wearing masks since April honestly cannot take america anymore. administration corrupt charge publishing numbers. anything twist numbers sudden make ""disappear""when far still dying. fearful first time becoming 1984. cant even leave country one accept us. sure anymore.. Well maybe someone magical girl dragon balls exodia coronavirus away convention. else they'll sent one piece towards dark continent Fauci isnt responsible speaking Australians. know that. events much lower spreaders originally thought non zero. 

It perfectly safe risk here. risk compounded bunch known unknown factors, one known mask wearing. 

If that's story news says ""this event shown known cases resulted protest"" that's partisan. earlier story also prove causation, 100% didn't, two media sources reporting opposite stories -- literal story different rhetoric  Wow. Thank you! It‚Äôs surprising one talking universities. Mine even requiring masks allowing intramurals large groups gather. I‚Äôm senior feel like decide finishing degree possibly dying. person replying raised great points. can't hope articulate similarly, I'll copy notion giving known harmful substance someone tough pill swallow, ethically. ever read waiver like before? donated tissue even trouble reading understanding legalese - bio foreign me. ensure study volunteers properly understanding risks? pulling vulnerable population exploiting them? questions seem easy surface get murky dive vaccinate lot immunized faulty? There's rescue treatment volunteer outlier, get immunity, dies? cause large number public distrust vaccines? Genome editing arguably set back deaths seen early studies. worry volunteers, public large adverse reaction.



This 10-20 people taken trial love said, ""last"" republican administration. Well clearly, well said. takes cake reason. checked symptoms coming back sometimes 1. milder, 2. different, 3. extreme. randomness adds confusion.

The guess point (due month) reinfectiing immune system reacts differently. Whatever happened free testing sites opened Walmart parking lots? actually ever happen? new record, right!

USA! USA! USA! USA! USA usa üò≠ deserving, honestly. America greatest can't seem **ever** anything right another country has. Plus medical coverage emergencies people lose jobs. Seriously hope convinces Biden mainstream Democrats need Medicare all, least really competitive public option.  Well Trump intentionally didn‚Äôt follow CDC Fauci‚Äôs advice, yeah pretty much Trump. anyone confident curb trend rapidly approach 100,000 cases / day? Depends are. go get test without wait time symptoms California. Yup. I've stockpiled ammo incase. government decides cant eat I'm going go get food fight it.


And maybe visit natl gaurd armoury too. Good thing flu airborne AIDS. /s  might deserve it, coming smoking-cancer link denier. dont think really matters, would assume many people spending much disposable income right now. Waiting impending financial collapse later year. remove 5500, still single day record US. Also single day global record. *sigh, unzips*  clicked Washington Post different thing, link like ""dammmmmmmm shit looks dope AF"" even use chant:

I can‚Äôt breathe. feel ya! I‚Äôve wanting leave country while. young kids don‚Äôt want uproot them. Although would time since aren‚Äôt tied school sports anything. Nobody welcome us though. 
At point would happy moving north think. I‚Äôm tired mentality here. It‚Äôs exhausting. Cool cool cool. Everything totally fine. Brad ‚ÄúTony Fauci‚Äù Pitt. Brad lucky enough honor requested Fauci.  How!? Didnt get shut down? mine. Someone else said realIzed it‚Äôs bang needs shared. That's pretty standard. enough tests right run dead people. calculate losses later.  Fauci got much drip Damn straight. one fucks shit like Americans. home state Florida leading way. Suck it, Texas. truly don‚Äôt understand wearing mask gotten political. Putting mask literally easiest part day... hard? reality show trash culture now. Millions people going ""woop, woop, woop"" ever idiot says something ignorant offensive. don‚Äôt listen anything says since demonstrated complete last understanding Ideal Gas Law. He‚Äôs self promoting quack. 142 new cases they're considering this. Get logic reason actually proactive safety people, Canada! New Zealand China still locked down. If/when open they'll feel effects rest world. real watch craziness. talks covid lock downs towards beginning 

this grandpa asshole fields politics, flip-flopping also known finding new information.

It's okay mistaken. tragic Dr. Fauci hand misleading people masks, whatever intention was, know 3 short months ago. Well, got end we?   Well guess gonna die sooner later. üò∞ dating someone child's mindset saying, sorry. Fuck markets No. Stop. Please, don‚Äôt... dont think absorbed anything 6-8th grade fine college. kids fine. Another lockdown Americans street, able afford rent food. Supposition spreading hysteria? reason officials advocating masks ensure health care workers sufficient stock, say 

I agree this, I'll side people mostly consistent admit wrongdoing Trump. fact lied ppl died lie. 

It's good hold people accountable lies cause people die. hope everyone controversial section copying pasting bit ready Trump time comes.  Sadly, looks like got timing wrong... Certainly great consolation whatever fuck happened GOT. seriously can't figure Trump trying make pandemic worse he's actually incompetent. skill acquired, lets hope there's time. don‚Äôt care anyone says. would want person dumber Ron DeSantis. That‚Äôs brutal look. telll us that, didnt shut social distance. And, us adding wear masks that, charge.  want chat this. Oh goodness, reply meaningful thought out...whatever shall do. sure told me. 

Go back beating rocks together... million people, whole 10% decide go stupid, happen irl, still 900,000 people fight. Deniers minority, virus spread people decrease lot. That's one way mass adoption believe shutting country going possible either.

Unless government willing completely subsidize basic needs (housing, food, medicine), gradually growing demand reopen greater greater risk. Subsidization like happen country whole consciously chosen tribalism society.

A federal mask mandate happen point, toxic individualism prevented ever valid option country. point really would surprised started seeing vigilantism towards anti-maskers.

I honestly know realistically accomplished given situations hand. Bunch-a-knuckleheads hard?! SMH funding focus seven priority areas, including $4.2 billion enhanced COVID-19 testing contact tracing, $4.5 billion purchase personal protective equipment (PPE) front line essential workers, $625 million fund child care spaces parents get back work, according government background federal government put $2 billion toward operating costs Canadian cities six eight months; provinces territories required match amount funds. feds also match new funding provinces municipalities put toward public transit, $1.8 billion. Kids happen. Sorry never get laid! Maybe it'll turn around day. internet access started. heard many warnings... reaction CCP news, info, stories coming Italy two loudest alarming me. asked countries. That‚Äôs get compared tracking CV numbers. Ah yup that's get skimming title handling covid though. Would suck greatly get sick bring home family.
But one choice, that's way Ohh, Balrog! Somebody get Fauci GODDAMNED NOBEL PRIZE! Voting in... one one would Okinawa.

This figure Tokyo alone. mil surprise me. 2 days ICU 12 days regular hospital surgery, first bill $269K. idea final total was, stopped opening envelopes while. live Florida usually add ‚ÄúIs spent long outside?‚Äù list. Comparing two countries who‚Äôs strategy basically ignore pandemic seems apt. Show r/covid19positive Lol, two college towns AL? need study figure Exactly this, fuck going on? worrying. inaccurate data, gives fuel conspiracy theories deaths overreported (which apparently England true). Comparing Sweden Norway Denmark like comparing New York Pennysylvania Ohio.

Sure, share cultural traits next population, density geography totally different. No, fine business allowing it.

A mask simply article clothing.
Walmart could make hats mandatory.

Hell, clubs dress codes.

That's Oregon doing

Not gonna lie, making assholes leave feels great! thought ‚ÄúDeal It‚Äù meme scrolling past absolutely. love good news definitely sounded like great news simple recipe ""how blame Russia hacker attacks"" - buy virtual server Russia, make attack it, show Russian IP address - write newspapers Russian hackers wanted steal vaccine - profit!

How handled pandemic response makes difference, never point. shutdowns done countries well still hurt impact felt years, decades. thing also global, even badly, global markets back normal. People spending like normally spend(different stuff, different amounts), production many things went hold, existing stockpiles might enough now, disruptions cause delayed problems, still pipeline heading us. yet either, long shutdown reset situation. still strict testing, tracking, monitoring place come out, likely forced repeat months. fatality rates Lombardy high couldn‚Äôt test. Antibody tests shown fatality rate around 1%. Saying high 10% anywhere 100% absurd. Shwabrian. Totally man. Totally. businesses would rather Covid Oracle

Just gotta weigh pros cons take risk,provided save emergency fund. Never got damn check. Filed taxes.. Maybe got lost mail? F life man. Lol. Question: wearing masks outside? I'm never quite sure one. take hour walk around neighborhood day without mask people ever around see anyone walk way. can't tell they're necessary socially distancing like that... anyone info this?

It‚Äôs great deal. Yeah might free socialized Europe taxes way lower US.

You get plan like better slinging packages part time UPS. It‚Äôs difficult. Almost Andrew Yang saying since beginning. reap politicians douchebag 2 ¬± 1 think ridiculous herd immunity comment. Check fatality rates Lombardy March. amazed. Lombardy especially heavily hit hospital system overloaded. US hospital system lot beds ICU beds, going overload, especially Southern states especially there's organization move patients state state wherever hospitals beds. Ten percent. Mark words. said paucity PPE available time. Maybe Trump used Defense Authorization Act get PPE essential medical workers instead making chicken slaughterhouse workers show work. Germany could send kids school Germany also made law masks required citizens about. 

We look countries see school successfully interest seeing else get cases down. 

For reason believe country earned right sent teachers students back. Maybe actually get cases could earn right. sad part Democrats seem sitting back waiting November. believe 25th Ammendment. 

Because know ain't leaving White house Nov 3rd matter wins. good news. sad news. there's way ever going happen. needless suffering what? said paucity PPE available time.

Now hear family wants get together. asked dad says hang people trust. Yet family members individuals thought COVID flu. took close family friend deaths shake them. 

It's hypocritical talk people wearing mask happily take trip visit family middle pandemic. lost dog year due kidney disease wonder parents next taking stupid risks. 

This whole situation sucks. That's choice though, fly low-cost. 

My response poster said mind budget airlines disappearing, think nice thing say seeing many people would job. research done time. said outright lie preserve PPE supply.

Fauck news excludes children? 

The part population likely touch everything pick noses?

Top comments praising this, fast enough change policy, even right direction.

They may expand children even ban elderly stores future situation gets worse.  Iconic I'm sure voted. Everything said factually correct. Despite old mate arguing technicalities term morality rate, clear meant comment he's lost track point. I've noticed common theme forum, Swedish people aggressively blindly defending Sweden's approach. someone lives Oceania, I'm going arrogantly defend ours, we're living alternative. looked countries?

I mean Germany, live Netherlands, also didnt suggest masks beginning, became mandatory wear masks places end April. beginning enough scientific evidence make suggestion. Holland, far, require masks public transport.

Our leading health institutions, Fauci, reversed opinion reliable data available.

It science, politics. new data opinions suggestions change, especially fast moving times like this. They‚Äôll muzzle dogs; kill two birds one stone say. welp spain second wave already. 
idk numbers expect see bad. Trump see anyone would want come Canada. I'm good that. Nothing see here. even many adults America. probably already that, tests can't keep :/ Take magnesium B12 along think people pissed olympics cancelled US Brazil poorly. think likely, they'll forced withdraw everyone else gets back normal No, based percentage cases coming back positive, US testing actually high enough. 25-33% positive rate states like AZ TX resort developed world around 1% less. Christmas 2022, like, get lucky.  Possible arguments are:

- They're aware human cost, prioritise economy stupid see bad decision economy well. 

- Minorities disproportionately affected, Trump dislikes minorities, therefore, mind. implies insane amount cruelty, super shortsighted old people likely die general old people vote Republican.

It's basically 'confirming' situation adapting own. want pandemic, here, want anything accept current situation, they're ""intentional"" consequences. like saying geegee :3 (or &lt;3?) instead normal gg game. hilarious Tell GF astmptomatic stroke.

Upon scanning her, see something lung though, zero abything else.

36 young, thankfully still tingly pinky finger, nothing else permanent. Texas significantly higher number deaths year years past months, handful COVID deaths. Make will, thinks abbot lyin'. 

If farted every time lied, wheelchair would hold land speed record... called states? Skimming over, sounds like far hospital capacity staffing. Ventilators mentioned one single hospital.

""We bed capacity, [personal protective equipment]. ... capacity limited mostly staffing,‚Äù Saravanan said. ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt talent area tap into.‚Äù mean governor doesn‚Äôt listen tRump. people going pay it

It free close free did? looking numbers infections still far exceed deaths. china's numbers, still illustrates fact covid nowhere near deadly treated. f'ing amazing national plan. even get PPE. White House ignoring health crisis. curiosity. Stockholm population 960,000; many Sweden's 5,600 confirmed deaths Stockholm? 1/3rd 1 month ago, it'll 3x next month. lol would handout that'd whole point. republicans got scared using plain english really winning thing, right?! degree. month... that's swedish model :) curiosity, actually happens debt then? get paid government? hospital never gonna see money?

And happens you? take everything feasibly house bank account leave nothing left, credit score turns banks away? comparison Nordics still pretty embarrassing. Norway, Denmark, Finland far fewer daily infections right now, got tiny fraction Sweden's victims (both absolute numbers adjusting population).

There's sugarcoating - Sweden fucked up. fair right assembly constitution flat denying protests would probably lead legal battle. know it‚Äôs bit tangent made clear everyone it‚Äôs trump fault here. Republicans need lose senate congress new president won‚Äôt able fix anything. Additionally ass hat cronies judges republicans appointed together destroying every arm government possible. doubt NFL season played all. college. risk significant WAY minimize. statues taken down, monument put statue legend on, right? Imperial County, CA's hospitals months capacity people coming way treatment (from Mexico US). think plans, least purposely. need settlers stay alive order claim new territory. US passports currently useless. name one peers?   US 24% total deaths world due COVID-19. US 4.3% world‚Äôs population. Math hard. not?

Words can‚Äôt hurt me, shades fauci purge coming Basically England would never recover Covid-19. suppose went hospital even ICU everything went well. months slowly surely recover disease. end getting run bus get involved road accident, srill counted covid-19 death

So eventually England would worlds highest death toll everyone tests positive die, even many years later coworker living Long Island says knows 14 people died. Statements like embarrassing you. Right 20 percent cases hospitalised require medical care

Note cases, loads asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic people never bother get tested. know actual infections much higher, tested literally everyone hospitalisation rate would go down. 

But doesn‚Äôt change issue around 15-20% cases need medical care 

When see 50,000 cases means almost 10,000 hospitalisations. doesn‚Äôt mean going ICU means lot people get sick, even don‚Äôt die approach information. course you, genius Redditor repute, deny information, confirm bias, retort facts straight State.

Wow, cultist. 70-80% required herd immunity?

The corona crisis strongly affecting Swedish shipping many seafarers notified dismissal unemployment, according new report.

- pandemic affected industry extremely much. traffic basically standstill since mid-March. currently two ships run Stockholm Turku, mostly freight. starting increase bit slowly passengers well, says Erika Janson, communications manager Tallink Silja, Ekot.

- high season. usually full roll. Several ships go every day. Lots people. very, different now. sad, says Janson Ekot.

The authority Trafikanalys made report Swedish shipping's competitive situation appears shipping companies making large losses many seafarers notified dismissal unemployed due corona crisis.

Shipping companies may also need scrap sell vessels cover losses, according authority.
The industry organization Swedish Shipping states least around 2,000 people notified termination dismissed within industry.

- ferries passengers affected. parts shipping also strongly affected. Take, example, Wallenius, transports cars around world. pandemic large impact volumes production sales cars decrease. segments, container vessels, also affected reduction production consumption, says Richard Engstr√∂m, CEO Sweship, Ekot.

According new report, shipping may future need raise prices repay loans compensate losses connection corona pandemic.

Despite challenges ahead, Erika Janson still faith future Tallink Silja.

- still positive future. believe corona settled little more, short-term vacations get boost. would rather stay little immediate area, go really long journeys plane, tells Ekot.

Biden lot progressive stances follow, progressive president definitely lead progressive country lead properly progressive president. Yes hope includes mass protesting tiresome. ü§¶ Honestly cannot believe people still making argument. Compare Sweden neighbors actually countries similar them, meaning demographically, geographically, culturally, economically, climate wise, healthcare system, population health, etc. Sweden 554 deaths per million. Compare Norway (47), Finland (54), Denmark (105). Utter insanity call success comparison.

Now imagine zero restrictions approach US given enormous differences Sweden. Hell, even matched per capita fatality rate would put us 184,000 fatalities. add significantly worse healthcare system, population density dozens cities, population health, varying climates, massive economic disparities you‚Äôd recipe freaking holocaust. Nice try. ""Research Determines Protests Cause Spike Coronavirus Cases"". First, protests outdoors hard get infected outdoors, secondly many masked. 3rd, fear protests kept lot people home, dampening spread. would say someone needs slap sense them, would advocating violence, would take lot slapping even get stop shouting rights freedumbs

Well, can‚Äôt, nothing Disney company IIRC she‚Äôs relative original owners. He's performed exactly meant to.
There's reason trump like that's he's inteligent agree toddlers view world. noticed Missisippi's death rate entire pandemic considerable higher southern states. Graph: article today:
[NBC News - Coronavirus surge brings suffering impoverished, underresourced Mississippi 40 percent Mississippi‚Äôs 51,000 registered nurses report working hospitals 15 percent trained critical, trauma emergency care, according Mississippi Board Nursing. Registered nurses Mississippi also lowest paid country, making approximately $14,000 less national median $73,300, according Bureau Labor Statistics.""

Lower salaries reason (ICU) nurses staying Mississippi. Fear virus exhausting working conditions also increase staffing problems Hospitals. result reflected Covid-19 deaths. Let's hope recent expanded mandate improve civil obedience situation getting dire. No, means whatever measures taken Belgian government(s) effective reducing spread virus. believe it. live area happening. local Covid rates staying low. that's due testing/tracing. People around good precautions. 

I worry happens rate creeps past test capacity. Cooovid cooovid cooovid cooovid! America fuck yeah! sure holds Green Card? restrictions permanent residents, unless there's obscure Visa heard about. 

Most likely, work Visa J-1.  True, mistake. think CDC also changed stance saw asymptomatic mention supply thing though, that‚Äôs Fauci. College football next God - Roll Tide Roll can‚Äôt believe took long understand liability thing. He‚Äôs hot mess since couldn‚Äôt shit inaugural attendance. won't. wonder think special ""Japanese culture"" around many people maskless irresponsible idiots. going live life depression never get past anything world. Serious question - Biden going help situation?  admitted downplayed safety impact masks early shortage available masks needed go healthcare workers. people started buying masks like TP hand sanitizer, we'd screwed hospital workers left vulnerable starting dying showing up.

Could handled differently result worried about? wonder came said masks absolutely critical N95 related masks purchased, cloth masks could used general public, people would use social pressure enforce better behavior.

If medical crisis people knew doctors nurses desperately needed gear, could general public walk around medical grade N95s look like selfish prick? Would social pressure kick in? 

Looking back, handled avoid ""oops, kind lie you, masks actually important.""?  idk last part yes true Fauci said would possible see 100K cases day. Looks like track rate. question get administration censorship hides numbers public. Absolutely correct, well said. Americans, general, different habits. suddenly confined home - literally right minute - would least month danger starving. Yeah, diet would deteriorate little toward end, huge problem. There's reason run buy 100 pounds flour emergency. Masks mandatory ireland monday (law currently written) nearly free covid getting single digits cases per day.
We back 30 day now.

We stall phase 4 reopening increase cases.

Yet still wont ban tourists! wont introduce mandatory quarantine like Australia has. 

(I would think threat alone 14 day stay covid quarantine facility expense would enough stop Americans coming holiday middle pandemic)

We may end mainland Europe closing borders us wont close borders US. cost insurance almost high  make per month euros! That's insane! people essentially given houses bust. Guys - put UV light INSIDE body, remember? Walk outside, drop pants, bend direction sun like supposed to, savages...just standing there, expecting sun kill virus. 

/s Yes, think good idea really rethink notions ""developed"" ""developing"", anyway. test today antibodies, I'll let know test positive not. Yes person classes raise risk. Ok, extremely dark. number infected going country wide. Must another reason imho. Dr. Fauci Says, ‚ÄúWith Due Modesty, Think I‚Äôm Pretty Electible.‚Äù EVERYTHING FINE. STOP COMPLAINING. GOVERNMENT TAKES CARE YOU. ANYONE DISTRACTING TRUTH TAKEN AWAY UNMARKED CARS SECRET POLICE. two weeks... would set bad prescient

If give slave cookie... know what's good keep borders locked permanently reports 14 day waits test results TX &amp; AZ. 
Seems like pretty good indicator testing insufficient right now. worth every penny funding get!!!! Good job CDC Department Evil government sits around thinks ways torment people? WTF. Ditto bullshit kick foreign students schools trying protect everyone virtual classes. kind people sit around think shit up? Sure, simply UnDersTAnD MeAnt Say good. republican authority figure intentions retcon reality honestly can't understand blatant hysteria humans - communicated clearly anyone wanted mask purchased one - n95 stated.

Did nail it? unproductive frustrating? one aphorism go:

Some people learn watching others make mistakes.

Some people learn making mistakes themselves.

And rest never learn. now, Brazil also deciding light fire thanks Bolsonaro I've made edit explaining read response. data I'm considering uses PCR tests provided. major states separately report PCR antibody now, effect minimal. dramatically lower positive rate going testing potential cases testing random population. 

Right. Except exactly opposite scenario OP describing. Yea!!!!! politicized virus.

Good luck convincing management though. Please future, god damn anxiety. Yep. Portugal - we're trucking along \~350 cases/day hoping hold together till then. ah dang got me. hillarious saved it.

German hard also english lot easier practice. nothing like: colbert, trevor Noah, John Oliver on... harald Schmidt kind good.

I learned/practice also flat mate scotland. Idk useful wee bit dumb...

My english really bad people understand try explain normally works.

Edit: forgot Ted talks also important Source improving english. red zone states Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah.

So exception California, mostly states folks don‚Äôt believe masks lockdowns social distancing. last presidential election regulatory capture? Well want American citizen already wears mask public? sentence many syllables, apologize! think bigger question need tackle this, is: children even human? people think feel healthy healthy. Certain issues like high blood pressure necessarily show symptoms. also best shape life underlying issue check healthy immune system something like COVID taxes immune system paving path underlying issue become much bigger issue. count nose exposure people masked? one lab, yes. know sort backlog (if any) labs have. vaccine 100% approved year whether fully effective not. sure guys taking account. Id guess october something approved desire widespread masking reflexive reaction anxiety pandemic.

Right, else would want wear them?

Do believe risk overblown, calling people see wearing masks ""hypochondriacs?"" Sorry hard follow comments. 

I agree lot people wearing masks incorrectly may taking additional unnecessary risk going stores least ignoring issue altogether. soothing poor little frustrated mind read. Thank you!

Feels like much ‚Äúpseudoscience‚Äù pandemic simply said wanted affect behavior - like justifying opening schools. correct given context date. Healthcare workers needed masks. Simple that. Now? statement true. Stop trying find ""gotcha"" statements without context People citing limited studies saying mean children can't infect children *or* adults. absolutely can. latest narrative spread around justify forcing schools re-open. That's.... Twisting words little. 

I think enough people tragic death family, Trump longer platform yell ears maintain focus, vaccine everything becomes retrospective active threat, enough people change heart happened year they'll start listening Fauci. think they'll change heart *entirely* politics think they'll ever fully admit brainwashed personally were, though.

Bush's diehard following turned years Obama's presidency. Even Republicans supported way 2008 suddenly started acting like always knew idiot 2012. Hospitalization data (and more): 

There bar graph keeps track current hospitalized patients. Keep mind FLA recently started showing metric, data limited go back several weeks/months like states do. Maybe remember job paying $8/hr people little work experience. dude also ""gave raise"" high school kid .25, still .50 corporate mandated minimum - kid told us (the owner cameras microphones everywhere listened us telling kid unfair) owner ""took raise back"" deducted money kid ""didn't deserve"" next paycheck like never got raise. entire conversation via text well. Nothing happened kid try beg parents get lawyer dollars. really don‚Äôt understand people don‚Äôt want follow basic instructions save lives. really big deal wear cloth face? want doctors scientists wrong ‚Äúlying us.‚Äù wearing mask help others ‚Äúcommunist?‚Äù TLDR: They're fucked honestly might worse shape US I've told parents, mindset never happened (lol) get bad, ones get two year old son sick something happens, making pandemic. People realize ruin life. Go media, find start paying attention. Fuck every young person think get it. goes parties something. wear mask goes around older people. respect that. think right. huge financial stake getting this... point, leads every chain store requiring masks, I'm ok motivated checkbook. Better half government willing let people die dont admit wrong. Half Trump‚Äôs slogan correct. 
America need great again. 
It past years seen us come suck even more. 
I little realistic hope positively change broken culture. Vietnam fair warning, already mask wearing culture. also FUCKING TINY compared US. yeah, try again. surprised voted oblivion. People sub defensive fact younger people spreading virus. could anxiety dude, running rampant ya know, look outside indeed saying anything good point example: I‚Äôm currently PhD student UM. Frenk seemed shit together beginning, seems hell bent opening prove point.

If works, he‚Äôll get hella clout. 

...but doesn‚Äôt?!?

UM playing risky game. Yes, they‚Äôre lot make campus safe. However, first wave kids *will* get sick. parents *will* come UM. Simple that.

I say, they‚Äôve set courses Easy pivots remote learning things get crazy. they‚Äôre offering undergrads opportunity choose remote learning top semester, would remove certain fees tuition. definitely flexible faculty students offering remote options need them. make sense reduces transmissions hurt economy much. visceral reaction uncomfortable science akin church scientist. ashamed didnt say agreed schools policy known consequences where. believe science right
Believe science left
Ugh back back 
Now spin (chorus x2) think Katrina taught politicians wrong lesson. aha. ok thank 24k CA. gonna keep circulating story end time? hiv-like properties destroy immunity cells. 

Perhaps parents try avoid children get meningitis least look types permanent braindamage meningitis actually cause, throwing children it. Imagine defending system cant protect workers global pandemic saying ""we capitalismed hard enough""  Considering NYC outbreak peaked April it‚Äôs July, right question.

Hopefully info coming. Maybe could result increased testing U.S.? Unless I'm wrong, believe numbers show death rates actually quite low. That‚Äôs works dude.... consistent ideology anymore. cult random even opposing opinions adopt. Environmental damage byproduct decades decades polution. anything living time company actually gives fuck environment. Building codes regulations, environmental impact studies, increased recycling, renewable energy. anything fix fuckups people decades ago. Alternative headline: ""It'll take US least 9 weeks get COVID-19 control."" saving one while? Hell Ontario moving Stage 3 opening today

Most Stage 3 happening lower-density areas province. GTHA staying Stage 2. Drinking beach bars casual sex also spread corona See Trump got virtual wall built North South! made America pariah world! countries think Americans plague rats country let science get way making $$$$$!

Promises made, promises kept!   that's everyday. guarantee enough.
So message correct masks US mandatory. Starting yesterday.

While controlling spread preventing second wave masks would amazing, hard tell that's enough. Yeah it‚Äôs weird getting posted again, already massive thread guy week ago. wonder find Hulu. ""if pans out..."" Sorry snarkiness, see metric misused constantly Reddit it‚Äôs major pet peeve mine. 

If you‚Äôd like see math/reasoning more, replied explanation another comment thread. Nobody trying take guns away mentally sound adult Americans. Except maybe Donald ""Take guns first, go due process second"" Trump. thread endorsed Nobel Laureate Dr Michael Levitt.

But, yeah, keep believing top minds r/coronavirus. Yup. chance put politics aside recognize global (hopefully) lifetime crisis. Erase political lines sand needed get this. (some us) chose denial, deception, division, stubbornness. ....

Seriously?

Why intentionally obtuse? anyone really buy argument? Honestly? claims people using virus political gain. people!

This man opposite leader. He's sniveling coward thinking political future. getting 150 million? That's half population. shouldn‚Äôt even question ask. Humans spread virus regardless age. It‚Äôs species thing sucks much misinformation around spread reopen school. Non believers learn hard way schools close month opening children get infected. America proactive instead reactive? Can't get behind paywall, looks like SacBee exclusive scoop. Well look voted for. Yes cows smarter us.actualy humans stupidest lifeform earth. Sauve qui peut. many people non-shit states need protected point.

The alternative abrogate states' sovereignty force, going happen. wearing mask since Feb 2

EDIT: I‚Äôm Texas no, one said anything /r/publicfreakout gonna SPICY week no, getting downvoted positive rate really dropping much, still hovering around high-teens. 

they massaging data, top comment thread explains gives links. He‚Äôs something else. Never thought would say miss Nikki Haley... TeleMedicine *is* house calls. several them, specialists GP. nice: driving, waiting. French study 3 children. study authors pointed study necessary. However, Reopen propaganda took study posted everywhere dozens studies showed opposite. correlation Next thing know, run Samurai swords. science denying small brainers thought would. Agreed. conditions probation changed. Suck Clovis White House literally said ignore science course fake. fools going get pepper sprayed, beaten, shot continue disrespect neighbors. like fool, problem take innocent people them. workplace letting people test positive come work. Masks also mandatory PA, except work place, recommended. powerless. [Here's Long Beach HATES lumped Los Angeles. also found [this back, compares different materials. simulate air gaps tests. I'm bit disappointed test regular cotton gap though. looks like gap varying impacts efficacy, causes something like \~50% decrease. really want protection, look fitted mask.

Honestly though, 20-50% still better 0%. combine measures, probably pretty well protected. Trump co include small bit companies getting trouble causing employees die part $1200 sold america for? want talk rest world it? [they take free Yeah dad bought lie, thought Covid would completely gone now. even took road trip Florida weeks ago, idea didn‚Äôt come back Corona racist hateful person. Certainly compassionate guy. ‚ÄúRick getting slaughtered online right decision made wear mask that‚Äôs right,‚Äù Conley said. ‚ÄúWe still compassionate whether agree someone‚Äôs beliefs not. Someone passed away compassion towards that.‚Äù


The issue stupid belief probably infected killed people. That‚Äôs something compassion towards. many people died flu span time (19 years)? America, kids human therefore cannot get cv. become human 18 21 (it's debatable), millisecond turn age, susceptible. That's precise cv is. Ok assuming 60% USA population gets virus next 1-2 years. 0.65% would equal roughly 1,290,000 0.25% would equal roughly 500,000 deaths.

So don‚Äôt currently know much population infected let‚Äôs say article correct it‚Äôs 10x official count.

That would 11.3% population infected 141k deaths... get 60% need multiply 5.3 comes 750k total deaths .38% mortality rate.

Obviously there‚Äôs kinds assumptions change giving quick breakdown numbers play. 

Of course maybe vaccine prevents 60% population getting it, rate I‚Äôm little doubtful. 

If get nothing this, least use barometer expect future.  no-one reports moderators see it, report rather complaining :) global sex trade fastest growing form commerce, worth $32 billion annually. fact, human trafficking fastest growing area organized crime third largest income revenue organized crime narcotics arms sales. makes business unique women girls sold sex trafficking earn profits pimps traffickers great number years, unlike profits earned drugs narcotics sold used expect see numbers next weeks, yes. want accused alarmist. people already infected. let's count bodies they're morgue.

April 1 May 1 63,000 US deaths reported calendar month. whole Vietnam War worth death one calendar month already happened. Natural selection work Living means, means literally dying many people. Wages haven‚Äôt kept inflation. economy strangled death decades ago barely holding due fake statistics hope. problem isn‚Äôt people don‚Äôt want work hard rewarded it. problem don‚Äôt get anything working hard. don‚Äôt get paid fairly. can‚Äôt afford live, healthy, improve business. spare money pay employees correctly? course can‚Äôt. customers money can‚Äôt pay goods services actually worth. can‚Äôt pay employees enough. employees can‚Äôt pay people‚Äôs goods services actually worth. can‚Äôt pay employees enough. 

You see problem? economy corpse. time Pretty effective incompetent fool. Broadband weak signal. likely referring think though.

Internet provided mainly fiber optic back bones signal degraded. know now, it? like change happened February March. Shenanigan season seems started, already. dude trick best thing that's happened far year Yeah, gladly state (NJ) governor extremely cautious even cancelled indoor dining returning week scheduled. doubt it‚Äôs made enemies, necessary. Oxford vaccine contracts produce 2 billion doses year now, licensing countries. cost licensing? Less cup coffee.

This largely grandstanding here, US already rights first batches Oxford one. Expected 100 million year. yeah fuck newsome decisions based reality goal keeping people safe...  many assholes Ca hate newsmen, roommate told ""I dont trust numbers, came newsome"" (numbers predicted covid cases.... actually made /r/idiotroommates based him)

&amp;#x200B;

They need massively slow things again.  not, continue happen know? Children different species, turn 18 change adults. ... dumb since vaccine. companies? Uhuhuhuuuu. subtle Canadian flex. Even ifr low it‚Äôs kinda odd disease care doesn‚Äôt kill enough. It‚Äôs disease! Let‚Äôs stop it. Everyone flu isn‚Äôt good even survive. Oh get that, lot companies gone bankrupt due pandemic economic lockdown. businesses though sunk bad strategic management, look Sears. However, case pandemic many cases massive businesses could strategically put money aside rainy day. Look airlines-- spent ton profits stock buybacks last decade. execs truly responsible thought long-term health business would put aside money. Instead, hedge they'll get government bailout.

How business stops months massive multi-billion dollar companies around decades suddenly tank? That's bad management. execs disservice shareholders (you could argue shareholders brought unto themselves) focusing short-term stock value long-term company resiliency. seems like trying grow gills flood coming. Perhaps give immunity couple generations throw deep end. Yup. It‚Äôs clear now. decided let rip see ends up. I‚Äôm going shelter place well next year can. ""\[The stepmom\] says stepson helping taking care younger children researching disease juggles work calls hospital, nurses doctors."" 


sounds like might listened wake-up call Jokes them, mask catches breath droplets actually blocking spreading covid. opt consumerism non-essentials while. Patronage Amazon keep market healthy, GOP mainly after. *This good news Comparing flu seems logical comparing 9/11 Vietnam war, IMO.

How come 12x-24x figure? 

Currently \~140,000 known deaths COVID19, is: 
5.83x higher year flu killed 24,000 
2.33x higher year flu killed 60,000 businesses reopened may 18th, limitations travel regions. Lockdown effectively ended june 3rd. forbidden mass gatherings, concerts indoor disco.
Gyms reopened 7weeks ago. Bars restaurants reopened 2 months ago.

I think bad article. italian might biased know uncle giuseppe needs wait free food grandma maria barely make end month provide meaningful information. show effect citing cause useless.

There things important here.

The first despite low daily numbers reopenings happening 2 months ago travel industry struggling. one hand took gamble (most new cases imported) hand enough. theory best possible scenario. Low prices, low daily new cases, ICU beds spare, free healthcare everybody (including illegal immigrants!). problem obviously cannot control pandemic. countries warned. People travel less. impact tourism industry airlines. Whatever cannot control outside borders.

Another thing also seen sweden opening bars restaurants mean people go like before. First reduce capacity keep social distancing immediate effect making part staff useless. enough staff 100 customers law half cut half staff useless. Also owners problem. Rent high maybe area full tourists capacity 100. tourists capacity reduced. Rent still contract.

In addition people go less bars restaurants scared. even half capacity might find able find 50 people want eat restaurant.

Then general mood upcoming crisis. People try spend less afraid what's next. Maybe second wave?

What smart working? 7.5 million people started smart working one day another. problem still smart working (and might months come). places opened areas full businesses made money lunch breaks struggling right now. whole system italy provides special deals discount tickets lunch breaks (they taxed lot less wage) support this. mostly gone.

In meantime state provide support people lockdown after. debate EU recovery funds right states refuse help. Including fiscal havens steal money EU countries.
This starting make even pro-EU people extremely critical EU. implications involve uncle giuseppe. Many people say EU cannot help look china russia.

While feel sorry uncle giuseppe problem uncle giuseppe nothing lose next time going vote none helped likely would say screw comes euro EU.

This big change.

We built cities smart working mind. public transportation, traffic jams overcrowded areas. occasion change. Small beautiful towns becoming interesting again, provided good internet connection. Pollution went down. ongoing crisis many suffer. better organization possible.

I feel sad uncle giuseppe story tip iceberg. wanted write article poor people could done before. italy. only. young man responsible. ""coddling"", mind, involves diminishing responsibility. ""blame"" concept comes judgments good bad. leap saying son bad person. fully responsible, live that. unless he's running around giving fuck father struggles breath, leap condemning son bad person.  Also mention ADHD, let tell working home/ online HELL ADHD. wouldn‚Äôt outlandish guess say likely getting accommodations, theyre fight get classes NORMAL, much less dumpster fire pandemic stepmom hot single soon Ever hospital Erlanger? man willfully ignorant (or outright lying) dangerous stain country. feel compassion him, could've chose spend time educating rather running around trying fight keeping others safe.

No compassion, none whatsoever, fact, kind opposite. would, general duty citations difficult get stick, especially cases like this. would pretty difficult well prove would needed issue citation, especially precedent.

OSHA probably done something least some, given quantity complaints, higher ups wanting send inspectors try inspect, ones would want something difficult time anything. ones farthest removed actual safety work ones making decisions. certainly way things be. meanwhile, orange thing sending secret police unmarked vans kidnap people Portaland, ""muh freedom"" people care actively cheering on. Actually science thing decision open schools based on.

I really understand white house's strategy this. guess late back double double double down. fuck think play pandemic spreads kids, teachers, parents start getting sick dying?

I doubt many people going go pols thinking need that. guess point wants virus bad people afraid vote, therefore, show all. could also signup local CSA produce co-op, make deliveries. Helps local economy, presumably fresher produce whatever Walmart providing. get reddit go back yelling kids get lawn mask use cycling who's sole purpose restrict ability breathe, simulate high altitude training.

The best part is, see sale online everywhere people know really for. Ok that's great happens three months? That's information really need know. legislation talks 'suitable face coverings', rather masks. must case elsewhere. Otherwise dolts skimasks.  fuck point efficient economic system one benefits efficiency except handful billionaires?

The US worst country developed world employee. We're worst country developed world person needs medical care. hilariously underfunded public education system, public health system speak of, unlivable minimum wage, highest maternal mortality rate developed world, highest incarceration rate ENTIRE world.

So, economic system efficient, efficient AT? efficient finding people decent jobs, educating them, keeping healthy, keeping prison, bringing children world, keeping alive. 

It's efficient making small number people rich. that's it. care that. Boomers ruin national debt, rule law, education employment opportunities enforce massive inequality, I'm seeing many reasons young people care infecting them. keeping news? Florida motherfucking Raccoon City. people need aware real world consequences pandemic. believe similar system drug too. First one free. Minnesota Wisconsin... Feel bad them. remember like teen - dumb made lots mistakes. blame politicians didn‚Äôt supposed - enforce distancing wearing masks. Anti maskers increasing illness increasing economic turmoil. must love seeing people unable feed pay bills. Wholotta people threads wanting men guns enforce rules like never said quote. said ""Science side"", said follow science actually. saying kids get serious illness this. stupid issue, issue transmitting disease back adults keep spread going never said ""The science stand way of"" schools fully reopening. corona virus transmitted pets? always thought Alabama backwards Florida appears wrong. going studies injecting this, NEVER inject kind sanitizer body. repeat, NEVER. going die painful death. Kentucky low rates infection death covid lowest unemployment rate entire earth would special interest groups want mess kind success? live kind culture mean go along it. Going along reinforces it. mistake. disrespectful ignorant. doctor spent years honing his/her skill profession. doctor. Part fighting anti-intellectualism listening experts actress. responsibility listen listen experts. guy right us vets call ‚Äúblue falcon.‚Äù Fuck guy. would understandable, anti mask argument would everyone stay home instead. opposition masks come people also oppose lockdowns. amazing people willfully ignorant they'll ignore facts providing. blatantly obvious media intentionally took quote context. US news media irreparably broken. don‚Äôt generalize based one anecdotal example going get vaccine comes out? won‚Äôt know long term effects years well. smoke drink alcohol? serious long term health effects well. 

You name thousand ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios, end day virus deal it. fact remains 99.999% young kids shrug like hundred viruses catch growing up. 

I business, hired private elementary teacher employees assist year. could easily send kids school still get great education. However, sending back public school rest them. 

Our kids better chance killed school bus accident compared covid-19. 

This life, deal shit sends make best decisions can. Everything risk, end day virus 99.77% survivor rate (our State health department), 95% elderly vulnerable. Simple. People take risks, people touch face mask stops actual contact Google find new evidence work, also disproves points one two. Also, current strategy working try? Thank goodness! didnt admit lying clip, guy asked question asshole. tell Fauci responed saying ""ok we're playing game arent we?""

Do guys even watch clips read captions? would believe Fauci admitted lying read tweet watched video. stretching fucking hard. suggesting catch Covid tested Covid? that's sounds like saying... BLAME CANADA BLAME CANADAAAAAA

It's even real country anyway Woah that‚Äôs crazy, would South America view us ba-

*looks history CIA operations American companies exploiting resources*

Oh right. think it‚Äôs great people trying find way, way, encourage states mandate masks, I‚Äôm guessing actually happen would hurt innocent people need funds would state leader. forgot deliberate underfunding agency overwhelmed longer proactive inspection industry reactive something gone bigly wrong.

The UK government's Health Safety Executive one case business owners would dread snap inspection premises. face consequences fuck up. .....judge gets kickback prisons parent company  idea ever doubt. Like idea couldnt even come from? media makes sound like children ones consider send back school. fucking insanity. know find sorcerer‚Äôs apprentice. yet still better lot. Good job Alabama. Well, apply here, it? 

Let‚Äôs say sleep mother, first time don‚Äôt get mad, second time don‚Äôt get mad. 

But know cannot handle sleep know sooner later mad. 100 times finally loose complain dad.

Same applies here, except Swedish people get fucked corona immune üôÇ internal changeable filters. school funding open fuck entire generation entire life.

Schools run virtual, kids get covid showing damage lungs kidneys heal, along significant serious issues unknown they'll heal. Kids want friends, nothing enriching went back forth years realized I'm hot mess meds. worked doctor find prescription works me, took tries. Sac state still open, 40+ kids classroom instructors telling kids wear masks.

What worthless order.

I even corresponded state health department, city health department governors office itself, gave photographic proof them

Literally nobody gave shit lmao knew sick, tell family younger son also got sick. enough. Gotta make lost state revenue. $300 minimum imo cant open air schools? weather nice enough go beach? first word describes comment pretty well. Wonder windows meme ever die. Considering Western media care disinformation benefits them, probably not. comment commented even expressing acceptance. expressing reason happened, ie: monetization incarceration. That‚Äôs quite journey, knew lucky mild symptoms people dying didn‚Äôt know could drag like long. 

Hopefully melatonin help, least it‚Äôs safe/cheap/readily available. Maybe you‚Äôll get extra good nights sleep nothing else? years since roamed. Got drive Phoenix San Diego, perhaps three years ago, signal almost way via Interstate 8. Plenty unemployed people willing hired security.... another shutdown many people already it? seems little late.

That's call self-fulfilling prophecy, unfortunately, quickly becoming true. Excellent news [It also counter argument now? 

That evidence effectiveness. 

I remember Norway one earliest press conferences FHI (our equivalent CDC) said ""we going make decisions wrong"".

We witnessing science based decisions real time. science nature constantly changing. models world works, update continuously new data available. 

Let's say current models says 70% probability choosing door best option, choosing door B 30% chance best option. course choose door A. still real chance wrong decision. 30% probabilities happens often. get new data turns door B best. 

Does mean made bad choice? No, doesn't. judge decision taking account information available time decision made.

In case ridiculous choose believe first thing CDC wrote, even changed advice. mean, reasoning behind that? make sense. Thank you, break first read this. Checks read past. President gets pass make decisions costs American lives pander get/keep job? Pfft. Maybe shouldn‚Äôt public health hazard then. kind like, 99% people survive hit car going 20 mph, guys want get run over? going kill you! let run over, stop sheep! Less 1% children crushed death tires, die weak begin with! Bath salts Maybe heat makes worse. know else could possibly be... Ok Noah, time! Let's start again. don‚Äôt know USA UK excess deaths believe calculated 5 year average weekly basis, based predictions. Science understanding repercussions based evidence.

Why would improve 2 weeks done nothing make improve?

It's like pipe sprung leak said ""if pipe stop leaking within 2 weeks I'll fix it"". Accuracy defined correct tests divided total tests. yeah, breakdown fits 92% assume dogs correctly identify positive tests 92% time correctly identify negative tests 92% time. However, need equal ways. blindly said everyone healthy, would 92 correctly identified negatives 8 incorrectly identified negatives, overall still achieve 92% accuracy. I'm getting downvoted saying international sub international content? mean jack-booted thugs come middle night force wear mask? mom keeps begging visit. bubble 2, me+husband. mom's bubble.... even know. siblings plus kids visit, live her, dad working. gandkids live dad stay sometimes working. sister lives boyfriend HCW goes gym regularly.

If situation would tell AI daughter ""stay home sweetie."" Finally make money stupid, poor Sounds like everything can. GF's son came back college he's isolating bedroom/bath 14 days since discovered roommates (one, shared bedroom) careful (e.g., parties house masks social-distancing, etc.).

He wears mask whenever he's common areas house spends 99% time room playing video games. importantly, share meals‚Äîhe eats room, same. dedicated tableware drawer refrigerator uses (door-handles cleaned use). hard thought would feel pretty safe even though we're household.

Everything's bigger Texas, except brains. shitshow getting started too. one trying prove point, defend articles studies specifically directed COVID-19.. ones compare flu. Medicine constantly evolving science data shifts opinions medical professionals. get paid understand data means make educated recommendations based current set data. 


But let take chance remind organization quoting effectiveness masks regarded influenza, fact recommend masks help mitigate spread COVID-19.  I‚Äôm really sure point is.

I'm saying great that, enough. School solve problem kids. Schools capable changing homes, get people involved can. They're often first people report potential issues child protection agencies enter homes, coach parents, remove kids needed. think even remotely they'll able that, even remotely kids regular contact friends. crazy site, designed US, built US ran US, predominantly US user base, mostly talking US.

Don‚Äôt forget tourism main industry. Telling potential tourists large amount covid wouldn‚Äôt good industry.

However, reason think Island communities able keep virus bay. theory may well merit, considering anecdotal evidence practically suggests super fit comorbidity.

Children parents. Schools staffed adults. children infect adults around them. problem. Opening schools filling classrooms lead massive increase infections. That‚Äôs conclusion I‚Äôve reached.

The bit abuse interesting though. happens summer? WH suggesting restructure school year parents don‚Äôt abuse children? don‚Äôt think are. that? relying school staff curb suicides mental health issues? shouldn‚Äôt providing vastly support teachers counselors? aren‚Äôt. WH actually threatening cut funding schools.

A ones without masks social distancing contract - care anymore. pandemic highlighted self absorbed, ill-informed stupid people become. stated they're engineer. I've worked plenty engineers bothered failure, wasting money. work, we'll build again, better! Agreed. question vaccines general. read 155 vaccines development. know ones take ones get available?

For example, every year take flu shot, (false?) impression ONE (1) vaccine year. idea makes it.

1) various flu vaccines?

2) one COVID vaccine rise top get combo shot (containing medicine several manufacturers)?

3) take 3-4 shots part vaccine therapy?

Just curious would work.

I hope (questions) make sense. Californians, stay fuck Oregon unless wear mask conspiracy theorists actually think Trump hero. Pretty remarkable opportunity take hobby exercise shit. Puts positive spin things. Especially staying healthy. usually everything bad US labeled communism force spreading new virus everyone not? ""You can't come without mask!""

""If wear masks wont go in!""

""Good... Thats wanted"" shitty hand deal American people. 

Choosing deal virus, causing people impacted, they're impacted discontinue unemployment that's keeping going chose avoid problem solving it. 

I hope extend it, many good people hurt this. It‚Äôs 1% hospitals capacity holds. doesn‚Äôt, jump around 10% answer question irrelevant. virus something recover go back normal. comes measure pain suffering child go lasting effects human body. already know actually care. pretty gross, sadly super common.  It'd really simple let people go back work keep extra $600 period time. That's correct comprise course Congress think way.  can't find something entertain Hawaii seriously lacking creativity right. Corporate stands Economy, presiding far Money. Us foolish drones pittances. law ordinance passed, illegal?

If unconstitutional, so? clause amendment would mask ordinance violate? Exactly this. sacrifice play money pay back student loans. fair reward paid minimums deferred payments decade?  isn‚Äôt even like people unemployment didn‚Äôt anything personally cause job loss. people actually signed checks, every year presumably, money knew they‚Äôd pay back.

Vaasa Health District announces new case covid-19 confirmed. first new case month half. person infected Sweden, says chief physician infection Juha Salonen Vaasa Central Hospital.

Juha Salonen say Ostrobothnia infected person want patient able identified, person infected Sweden.

- person tested positive already Sweden. Since person prolonged cough symptoms respiratory infection, thought would new test here, also positive.

The salon says test positive covid-19 quite long time infection little difficult know still infect others.

- important thing patient close contacts family tested. Everyone else family asymptomatic.

#The family voluntary quarantine since came Sweden

The healthcare district says person well home isolation. person's close contacts also quarantined.

- good thing family already quarantine since came here. way, situation pretty good. many people exposed corona, says Salonen.

*What think rest summer, Ostrobothnians come home Sweden?*

- possible travelers Sweden Finland may infected coronavirus. fortunately, seems number corona cases decreasing Sweden well. still quite cases Finland Nordic countries.

#63 confirmed cases Vaasa healthcare district

In last 24 hours, 55 tests taken covid-19 Vaasa healthcare district. Since beginning epidemic, total 3744 people tested. Among 63 confirmed cases.

The latest case found May 29.

No new cases covid-19 reported Southern Ostrobothnia's healthcare district. last 24 hours, total 105 samples taken.

Central Ostrobothnia's healthcare district stopped reporting daily coronavirus. Testing tracking infection chains. little use USA, cause noone track many contacts. understand point post relates said.

In fact, proved point. clear does, yet ranting supposed 50 percent infected people spain ""long lasting symptoms"" it? long lasting symptoms idea does?

But keep manipulating argument make feel better. Thumbs up. California Uber Alles guess one good thing mask dispute amount people nope right life looking them. mask? Mesh mask? Mask nose? Nope can‚Äôt other's life, need talk move along. working well Sweden, USA? Legitimately curious one press conference WH, IIRC. Fauci far public adviser God knows many years.. understands manage massive projects like this, much better. Trump may ambivalent masks, that‚Äôs meaningless context. 

The context since Trump ambivalent, Fauci excuse push face severely downplayed virus kept, face absolutely supporting data, 

The estimates pushed turned garbage numbers. Post ww2, US faced much worse pandemics (H2N2 example) react shutting down. suggesting ‚Äúhoax‚Äù virus going evaporate despite wide-ranging actions taken.

Trump actually described Democratic complaints handling virus threat ""their new hoax.

‚ÄúWe exposed far left‚Äôs corruption defeated sinister schemes let‚Äôs see happens coming months,‚Äù Trump said rally. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs watch. Let‚Äôs watch. dishonest people. Democrats politicizing coronavirus, know right? Coronavirus, they‚Äôre politicizing it.
...
‚ÄúThey tried impeachment hoax. perfect conversation. tried anything. tried over. They‚Äôd since got in. It‚Äôs turning. lost. It‚Äôs turning. Think it. Think it. new hoax.‚Äù

The vaccine research, airlift PPE's, taking place word Fauci holding administration back sane things. 

You sound Fauci part administration response, let alone top advisor providing wrong advice. Yes administration made mistakes. One fire incompetent advisors - Fauci prominent among them. Yes, let‚Äôs waste taxpayers money get back someone trying protect people city.
Sounds like brilliant plan. love administration tries discredit him, eager offbeat magazines give voice. realize Style magazine opened article read it. know Italy, answering ""other countries"" question point view UK...

Companies put anyone like ""on furlough"" meaning they're still employed company they're work Government pays company 80% salary ¬£2,500 per month. companies pay employees amount Government reimbursing, others topping amount staff still full pay.

There's also similar scheme self-employed people.

During lockdown, people generally spend amny money transport, going pub, going holiday even getting haircut, 80% salary enough live on! guys, would Medicare fix racism!?

D* mocrats fucking awful. Mom watches Fox News telling last night. finally tell lying whole time everything,

It brought Daughter went back summer school PE teacher got shut school two weeks. wife type 1 pediatrician told us week aware it. know since WH gonna cook books. Well, unexpected...... Stop blaming everyone, it‚Äôs certain group people affiliate orange moron multiple mini me. northeast found way function slowly getting back new normal. Atlanta here. work public space.a lot foot traffic good news majority people actually wearing masks.me crew spend hours sun wearing them.this mans argument ludicrous.not bright Person Kemp is. Mayor since day one. Desantis wemt wrong I'm pretty sure they'd hire cheapest bouncer's could find. would go way pay more? Oh come condescending swine. Look CDC website tell says. suggest masks ""may help prevent spread Covid-19"".

I American use whatsoever CDC. USA definitely place want go advice control corona :) 

I care facts, show countries use masks control epidemic. Look up. expect someone stole election voter suppression... March 30, Fauci, Birx White House saying 100-200k dead best case: 9, changed 60k estimate: 

April 18, Trump saying maybe 60-65k: 29, US passes 60k Trump says ""it's gonna go, gonna leave, gonna gone."": Good job scare-mongering OP .. need moment. Fucking cunt question whether actually stop customer entering store without mask. 

Also, allow employees wear masks chin, seems fairly common occurrence live.

Masks required North Carolina, wouldn‚Äôt know going retail locations police refused hand citations. Especially considering print money. 

The entire world could gotten together said ""every expense wiped books"".

But, instead corruption people wanting make buck. See big unemployment fraud uncovered. 47,000 fraudulent claims MD. It'll half million Christmas. Except WH controls numbers, they'll say 800.  far know, lock down. mandatory masks public places. Sadly seeing increase cases again. average 10 hospitalisations 2 deaths, country covid free. Used live PA, GA near Athens work Lawrenceville. 45% people wear masks, I'm livid everyone back home seems message. ""muh freedoms"" ""they're taking rights"" suck fuck up, obviously unaware what's happening Watch entire 60 minutes interview. say exactly that. horrible put fundamental christian, guy paintings jesus, ghost Jacob Marley's virginity charge biological threat, even ignore *their* advice it? Italy, New York...shit hitting fan closed country. numbers dropped. opened back up, numbers rose. opened up, numbers kept going up. 2 holidays hit we're worse beginning they're wanting send us back school.

This trickle-down stupidity coming top. No, that's communism. need hit deductible first. Jail also unreasonable, justice system limited two solutions, you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs still major problem. feel this. work public safety, i'll considered essential matter what. another shutdown happens, literally even know i'll working, i've told state move wherever wants crisis take paying company. 

I make good money rural-ass area, i'm happy keep working others stay home, goddamn, throw actual bone, once. even need $1200 check, would rather sent $1200 worth masks, gloves, PPE. I'd go work Tychem suit gas mask every day state paid it. many potential vaccine candidates looking quite promising, it‚Äôs definitely worth take every practical precaution avoid contracting virus get inoculated. Stay safe! Yes, did. How‚Äôs right wear mask treating now? Hallelujah third world citizen, I'm absolutely dumbfounded things happening USA. simple protective act wearing masks politicised much becoming part much propoganda?

I mean basic medical sense pandemic. constantly get frustrated absolute lack understanding shown here.. country's number trending dangerously high.... watched tv talking yesterday presscon shower rain. Pretty much stable eh. Lies. 

This answer business's, stock market investors. way possible. worst still come.  racists gonna racist wait til player gets serious lung scarring loses 20% oxygen intake. Stopped reading ""32 45 companies paid bonuses within 6 months"" - 6 months ago bet companies never dreamed bankruptcy. Globally compare, wherever serious outbreak healthcare can't keep surpasses them, possibly even combined. already saw NY, we're seeing AZ right now. Get reddit Kemp ): you‚Äôre governor groceries online, peasant collects it‚Äôs ready arrival.

Well entitled. districts can‚Äôt figure shit out, they‚Äôre ready re-open. protests! going trust guy millions dollars riding staying sick buying vaccine? total conflict interest guy trusted one second... point titles take someone's word something title. example.. lot doctors morons .. finished school eventually got degree title.   thats ubi works. give everyone $. middle lower class. rich receive it. gives poor people average people enough survive month, enough would quit working. money comes removing hundreds welfare programs states. programs cost ton people constantly apply for. Welfare, food stamps, affordable housing, disability etc gone rolled one payment. Think overhead hundreds thousands people maintain programs gone. Oh come condescending swine. Look CDC website tell says. suggest masks ""may help prevent spread Covid-19"".

Emphasis **may lol, thus complete resolution. little attention detail better use commas children magical creatures, impervious virus! keep saying it, eventually true feel guilty sending back school probably causing deaths small significant number America's children much larger number people work schools. Seem major brand one-a-day multi-vitamin covers that. India Brazil made similar deals like US procure doses Oxford vaccine approved daughter used kick shoes car time. one day took seat stood snowbank tending siblings. end that. legally required make stupid, irrelevant comments Reddit? Like way Amazon Q&amp;As full comments people actually typed out, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù instead responding question? part too, yes. point is, always gave us best information time. never lied anything. Florida says hold beer. Teacher here. idea article girl's home life situation was, easy access content, easy keep posted content...I would guess multiple teachers posting class info different ways (as everyone figuring fly), teachers expecting near level work (not going happen home), emotional effects lockdown, virus, etc....I could see could easily overwhelmed turn entirely. Many colleagues reported rough time getting teens schoolwork home. students well supported home, access technology, etc. Take money spent ""justice"" system put toward services could lend hand! getting downvoted man valid point. people want downplay criminal actions teens. She‚Äôs gonna adult less 3 years! Better start introducing line instead slamming face 18 like many people seem think best way go this. 18 wouldn‚Äôt give crap ADHD make excuses behavior. mind also still pretty sharp.  warning. civil banned. 3 months ago May. course, yes. America already masks social distancing back then. 

I got laid due COVID-19 way back March. 5 months ago. mean, already bought like 300 million doses... Shame you. recommending coup? Uhh, yes would. remember 2016 quite well. Polls fairly accurate, especially national level. Hillary 70% chance win. Well, leaves 30 Trump, narrowly swing states, total 60k people handed presidency.

If election held today, would absolute embarrassment Trump. BS. course, I'm explaining might kind small pockets herd immunity pockets London secluded rather B. I'm back London 4 month hiatus can't figure fucking life people still wearing masks screaming going bars. statistics UK shocking country prepared this, already facing crisis NHS staff shortages. transmission rates London look ok we're populated city way Istanbul guess took train. 1/4 people wearing masks even though mandatory Even better, thanks! people ingenious ways making stupid thingsüòÇ Lol anyone else find ironic wearing mask probably wouldnt stopped getting disease, spreading presymptomatic?

So really means regrets others wearing mask protect her. family member retired postmaster, worked 80s early 2010s. saw change drastically, happy retire felt government forcing USPS go bankrupt. Budget restraints, unable fill vacant positions, ever increasing expectations mail volume, etc. convinced govt gave postal service wanted go private. Oh must nice, head company still telling us hoax need ignore media. feel like I'm island here. wild. friend within couple days. rough cough, around week 100%.

Another friend-of-a-friend marathon runner can't even make mailbox month recovery. Trump. conspiracy majority people get fine.

They point ignore serious cases. like right now. let natural selection takes care selfish, completely ignorance, mother fuckers crossed mind, give masks. I've also seen hostility youtubers tried California beach town. 

 really disheartening. 

 feel we're seeing clear divide former "" United "" states. becoming tragically dire. deniers exacerbating problem make worse *all* *US* percentage give chance? would say less 20%. know people whose parents hospital this... still take precautions. new rally cry seems be, ""Give Liberty even Gives Death!"" wait 100k day, I'm sure it'll gone time.
ü§î maybe that‚Äôs take wake tfu  one many. Fucking bankrupting country people go buy Northface jacket fucking summer. fucking joke. bit like wearing bucket head ride motorbike .... 

If wear non-mask wear real mask. It‚Äôs worse people wearing real masks nose sticking out. Republicans saying entire ‚Äòplandemic‚Äô end November right election. 3. Weather mild. significant outbreaks occurred weather hot cold outside. I'm assuming we'll probably get january. I'm genuinely curious legitimate argument, explain? Seems like common sense, tests = cases socialism rich America also stopping testing high demand. area grew in. county's account lab suspended due high test demand! 


 So, business usual? they‚Äôve said could emergency doses high risk groups october mass production anyone wants one early next year. 

i‚Äôm assuming majority people want able get one end year they‚Äôre able meet october goal. Think cost test kit. think money elites thought saving ignoring pandemic. point need admit messed even personal finance perspective. Bingo! Plan unexpected. Spitballing here.

Is possible they‚Äôre horrifically desperate vaccine get approved mass produced major country. need one early next year risk societal collapse.

But don‚Äôt trust early data coming Moderna Oxford trials. They‚Äôre worried manipulated it‚Äôs would do. 

So verify data. isn‚Äôt going vaccine, they‚Äôll know 95% countries do. I'm going pour large drink. 

Cheers. burning fossil fuel alive?  picture phrase ""with due modesty"" needs meme. wealth correlated intelligence, professors would make football coaches. yet... know shows balls? Joining online forum share pictures guns people. badass. Welcome future. sarcasm really unnecessary. yeah 1000000 million people could say online didn‚Äôt say saw online someone wrote Facebook really don‚Äôt go social media besides reddit. Anyway people also taken legal action place sent positive results either right they‚Äôre bat shit crazy looking attention maybe accidentally sent someone else results possibly testing sites playing numbers conspiracy theorist right.üò≥üòÇ either way don‚Äôt care enough continue stating heard today. teacher? Congratulations. That's fair. Actually unless got 100%.

But could read comments prevent repeat myself. understand Congress works you. Raw numbers useful. 

There 10 million people LA county. Lol anyone claims proof pandemic still years, remember movie production dark months now. Even get vaccine distributed Christmas theaters open it‚Äôll take awhile even movies ready release. Prolly Uighurs  He's going Abbott route funny live here. hang Dr Fauci, 4 months Trump knows about........

This video cracks up. Yes please. Real bullshit sensational questions, like. 

It standard operating procedure surgeons operating room staff wear masks (which don‚Äôt impede oxygen exchange) entire surgeries, types routinely last 10, 12, 16+ hours. aren‚Äôt significant long term effects we‚Äôve noticed yet. 

Are negative social consequences substantial portion society dead suffering long term effects? child would see outweigh effects wearing mask question whether moot. 

Why fear based modification? It‚Äôs common courtesy, kind like brushing teeth. besides, everyone makes decisions avoid negative outcomes every day (which guess could say fear based?), like brushing teeth. maybe don‚Äôt I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm dealing IRL. 

Any environmental consequences anything else made similar materials people choosing dispose responsible irresponsible ways going effect like every product. It‚Äôs like masks made nuclear waste. Wood pulp cotton biodegradable even. 

And lastly, no. 

Kindly get thee back bridge. point here? know virus control, people tested negative may contract virus thus become positive? don‚Äôt understand logic points Yea, new records tomorrow, next Thursday can't both? Gov. Ducey, Eric Trump-style: ""And I'm Doug!"" *There. Ugh. Come on, first grade shit here. removes credibility make mistake like this. mask? 

Good luck him. Hope pulls through. Sorry meant back wkth numbers saying law supply demand disproven shit 73k cases 900 deaths again. seems like getting nearly 1,000 deaths new norm People bashing Pritzker, Lightfoot, we're bad Illinois.

We've masks required public since May 1st. I'm south Texas. local news nearest city said city seriously considering reopening abandoned hospital treat covid patients, and/or setting temporary clinic nearby. city council stuck arguing one side thinks need (which probably true) thinks expensive apparently massive global disaster factored city budget year. Meanwhile beaches closed days ago already shitty local hospital system overwhelmed. small town days confirm 2-3 times cases PER DAY total near beginning June. It's, uhh, great. They‚Äôre attending school don‚Äôt work. Children home throughout virus anyone else. likely catching family. He‚Äôs using big words..... Every store go says require masks. None really enforce it. wanna cry. It‚Äôs over. America done. give benefit ""movement"".

They're dumb. Please wait tally finalise posting this. happen soon. However post final tally displayed get count goes front page people see final total day. No, he's 81yo slot jocky. Great guy, hope pulls can‚Äôt speak u/catdadsimmer... would never angered someone writes you. read evidence MMR vaccine may reduce severity Covid19 symptoms - may children pregnant women typically get booster shot, lower rates complications. Perhaps precaution, people could update MMR shots it‚Äôs 20 years. articulate, well thought response. I'm sorry wasted dick head. work today lady wearing mask, rather hanging wrist fucking loop. even bring going wear fuckin bracelet? Publix announced right saying requiring masks starting next week. went one tonight already requiring masks. first time I've seen 100% wearing masks. Political science perhaps. Note: According Worldometer, 50 states Washington D.C. reported numbers today.

Fortunately, deaths Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Vermont today.

Mate left toe rational thought you. world favour fuck Lions den adult hobby store. administration would followed advice. Honestly, Trump listened actually managed situation instead ignoring it, Biden would huge trouble right now. guess hope good thing comes national tragedy. 100k people still call hoax Ah, yet another daily record broken. rate sure hitting 100,000 daily new cases end month - Dr Fauci futilely warned us.

Holy fuckin hell Exactly like ‚Äò52 pickup‚Äô.... Pretty bullshit article. NY metro like four times population Sweden‚Äôs entire country jammed small area far highly trafficked Sweden infinitely bigger international hub business, trade tourism Sweden. graph highlighted actually shows NY recovered quicker despite way higher death rate initial explosion cases. faint line shows Sweden didn‚Äôt flatten curve infections.

Plus $1200 flat payment. Canada contained better, America gave WAY money citizens.

ETA: downvoted facts. Hysterical. Considering Friday/Saturday usually days reported infection numbers peak week, I'm gonna go ahead say yes. Worldometer currently shows 73,311 today. Tomorrow/Saturday likely betwen 75k 80k. guess 100k per day Fauci predicted could reality soon. nah, lets not. open country, sit home mask u want. guys balls lmao ! sounds miserable. take Advil headache like 10 minutes I'm illiterate. wife independent contractor never got ""amended unemployment system"". chef high end place.

NOPE. ended house full (now ex-) in-laws lived 71 Sylmar quake still get shit together teach kids keep shit together simplest ways.

""That's going happen me"" far minds go states.

It's worse worst thieves openly running show, attitude describing around forever never going change.

Just wait 'til ""fake"" climate crisis starts to, uh... *heat up.* Yeah reading something today said good chunk (can't remember %) still impacted toll virus takes body three months.  Go 100k! Amazing numbers, hard others reach numbers. One employees tested positive 5 weeks ago require 2 additional negative tests allow back, received 1 positive last week week, 5 full weeks received first negative test.

Those taxes even cover spend already regular basis, let alone massive relief program involves staying home means new taxes coming in. There's money that. Nope, europe, US wonder tempted come meeting without mask start coughing everywhere. Luxembourg also. Looks like second wave coming. Hope learned prepared. KY Attorney General sued KY Governor?

Whilst handling outbreak best, done things prepare worst. slogan 'prepare worst, hope best'. introduced additional funding NHS wants get half million tests per day October. also wants prevent another national lockdown tackling local outbreaks.

This people say he's Trump. Trump, UK, densely populated country would probably higher death toll US ironic wealthiest among us don‚Äôt ‚Äúwork‚Äù money. sits grows due compound interest investments. earn nothing working man punching clock.

I'm sure thin skinned narcissist would take joke attack trump.

hey whole Covid thing vanish, right? What's big deal? 
Do fewer tests, get fewer cases. simples That‚Äôs I‚Äôm sayin Sweden got zero intervention fine opening everything shit. Trump won‚Äôt able stand Fauci icon. Well one thing, were, he'd pushing cure vaccine.

Vaccines, part, big money makers pharmaceutical companies. given times possible get person immune response lasting consequences (you can't get approval vaccine that, example, causes liver damage etc). means get sell doses per patient most, can't sell anything help them.  Pharma wants things sell offer again. Drugs diabetes example make ton money people live type 2 diabetes decades take lots drugs everyday. also like novel antibiotics/antivirals often catch infectious agents meaning need drugs over. 

The best way pharma company get money vaccine added standard care people. Things like MMR, diptheria, HPV, meningitis, etc probably scrape profit enough people get given talking big bucks here.

Your comment ignores every point made. medical professional would ever stupid enough realize filter Respiratory disease would helpful containment.


All reason Fauci lied masks. 

BTW, Trump ambivalent masks time.

Since attention tends short March ""A lot people scarves, use scarf,"" Trump said. **""And feeling people want it, there's certainly harm it.""**

Edit: Added quote Trump's exact words NPR article War worst thing happen society!

While America nothing wage war consonantly start wars.

Also people died many 6 months still know anyone got infected even especially there's one know died it.

So anecdotes fake complete hoax. 

All wear fucking mask, party among 1000 people people can't that. That's it. Yet can't that, cry masks. work Sam's Club. emailed us saying offer mask let person shop refuse. bullshit. Stevie Wonder bullshit probably best everyone oracle stayed way.  Covids wanna watch Philly. mentioned yesterday husband! Yep that, many WOULD work even pandemic, cannot shutdowns beyond control. American people want relief money ""it'll make everyone dependent government"". Also argument government providing literally public services, matter small. Immortal limited time. Dr. Fauci says low covid death rate U.S. ""false narrative"". Could someone explain is? low death rate positive thing horrid news? know India's numbers specifically, total positives combined percentage positive give pretty good indication many un-tested cases are. instance, many countries (S. Korea, Australia, many Europe) positivity rate well 1% conducting many thousands tests. find 10 new cases, pretty confident likely 0-2 new cases tested. Totally different country/state 25% positivity rate thousands tests. know exact math, know statisticians could easily model good predictive ability. young adult paid minimum wage wouldn‚Äôt super motivated spent days fighting Karen‚Äôs. understand it‚Äôs important, disaster job duty. there‚Äôs big problem. shut businesses, shut parks, shut schools. people still hosting parties gatherings homes, fighting one hand behind back still aids vaccine. Trump still office. happen late January anyone claiming Covid19 bad compared causes death. is. He‚Äôs riding pale horse red cap Sounds good me! young people people around age (20s-30s) know social distancing wearing mask. older people know (50+) think bs. know tons older people traveling, hanging people, wearing masks, etc... Leopards eat unmasked faces. 

Stop leopards. egotistical asshat. think!  closing huge cities around world report 400 cases. 

We screwed. thought numbers going fall would low. fall/winter going catastrophic. least picture wearing masks? Nah, forget cops. Hire out-of-work bouncers. election tomorrow, would beyond landslide

Uhhh wouldn't. learn single darn thing 2016? Clearly not. ""Hillary 90% chance win!"" vicinity photoshoot yes. According CDC guidelines. hypocritical ridiculing population wearing mask photoshoot without one. also causes division gives opposition pull strange see forget speaks regular hes treated like model. Would expect someone position higher platform play model. politician same, president included, disgusting.  yeah sun isnt killing shit. certainly AZ sun, hot enough get. Hey bot; u remove trump n stop censoring people? Lol strongly suspect house parties far bigger problem outdoor dining  planted one 35 years ago. 

If died then, world would measurably worse. 

If died then, hard find measurement worse. 

Plant trees. They‚Äôre friends ask nothing. Pretty soon virus planet mass hospital 43 days. Never saw bill said higher hundreds thousands Almost like CDC someone's reelection campaign NCAA March Madness. /u/undeleteparent know many people died last 3 months chance anything based paper.... Yup Omg! must mutual friends! can‚Äôt stand Facebook! Unbelievable many dumb fucks there. Good catch! Even he‚Äôs trying help once, fucks up. XD Agreed, he's skilled man. hero worship talk flawless seems bit dangerous me. flawless worshippers perceive? Holy crap gets upvoted days.... Southern California north LA. People got used wearing masks last big fire. like noone's worn public before. depression caused poorly run government continue what‚Äôs doing. Well good night troll. Fucking Alabama stupidity!  idiots. No. Masks known prevent spread viruses. sure help virus, mean default wear winning. Band wagonning law. Sad hear... someone r/Masks4All shared something similar I'm struggling find it, anyone remembers thread saved something please DM post here. Colorado? _""deal it""_ flying fuck nuggets supposed mean? people clapping applauding? How...? going get worse. McDonald's forgetting fries order  still remember people saying saying weren‚Äôt going vote. Hillary Trump.  Yeah, really avoiding retest people they've free symptoms certain amount days. still flag positive repeat tests continued viral particle shedding places currently policies can't return work test negative PCR. people end getting test every week still flags positive.

But right tests become limited due surge south even hospital facilities elsewhere asked limit testing order send tests south. implemented correctly think could probably efficient we're using tests. problem lot time they're depending people SELF REPORT whether fever people total idiots this. shoot everyone without mask? Huge sports fan really focused bigger things sports right now. 
Its unsafe kids go back risk families kids schools. Rich folks sending kids school, know kids get tutors strict cleaning policies rigorous testing 2016 would like libel back. 'murica? don‚Äôt know store sells paper pens easy make signs .. lot sell masks
So take shelf‚Äôs north east targets months Smallpox eradicated vaccination, last known case 1977, zero tolerance anti-vax science deniers, essentially force gunpoint need be. shoot everyone walks outside, cops would love Replace statues Columbus Fauci tbh. Cuomo 2024.  Man that's everyone around saying anti-lockdown people protesting. told ""protestors"" guess see Fauci good every post r/Coronavirus gonna blame testing done moved pathetic story? good old donnie finally made America great /s 5 months since government abandon us starve. Trump [ordering hospitals send data [state governments preventing mask looks like American government actively trying kill many people possible covid.


This genocide. need vaccinate everyone world. need get R &lt; 1, take time much rest world get. mostly combination parents burning vacation time time. already security camera patient room, hospital decided they're ok HIPAA risk. 


The risk patients room, lots info gets passed around hospital.  


Maybe trailer idea could work would go lot effort show FDA patients getting quality care quality facility, adverse outcome including psychological. (Even consent.) easy fast. 


There's way important questions film it. main question Medicine. isn‚Äôt going sports. People missing lot important things watching game. don‚Äôt need thousands athletes wasting resources getting tested every 3 days teacher whatever wait 3 weeks. Blame nothing president. It‚Äôs sports. awesome, thanks! gather central north Florida, outside Orlando Jacksonville actually least infected parts Florida. data also suggests last 2 weeks cases, half cases people less age 40; however, majority people hospitalized 50-90‚Äôs, lets us know almost reported cases last 2 weeks young adults teens barely any, all, hospitalized. could change cuz lag reporting, cases reported necessarily people diagnosed last 14 days. it‚Äôs like Texas I‚Äôm data reflects cases reported deaths 5 weeks ago.

All all, avoid Florida can. must go, stay away Orlando metro, Jacksonville, southern Florida (from East West). Skip Disney World go see Legoland instead. That's whataboutism, I'm gonna dismiss it. American here.. rooting people quarantine mean? news link anything. watching news ive despair, used tried keep BBC world I'd least hopefully get truth NYers travel Florida winter. Obviously increased year, I'm sure, also probably folks decided stay longer... yeah, even know point try make exactly? NY responsible COVID Florida? OK, true? get from, it, control outcomes. Everyone someone else blame virus came from, necessary. 170,OOO cases day next month, fucked, government failed you. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start nun wont nun.‚Äù -Dr. Fauci Aww, thank :) Yeah never hit 100k. Dr. Fauci doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs talking about. /s 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot!  I'll pass. think Trump let Cuban doctors states? doesn‚Äôt, cuz it‚Äôs something completely made up.  month tests. sounds like line long haulers never cleared virus.

You people reporting repeated waves 90-100 days. I'd say likely relapse case get ideas US history movies. generation could get cold, delicious ice cream soldiers sailors front lines world war literally halfway around world, sent man moon, dead. Literally every aspect American life run corrupt incompetents like banana republic. Remember going magically go away? Legally allowed that.

Saying fined cross border self isolate 2 weeks okay though. Hard compare, though since places like Florida practicing better social distancing last months New York early March. truly unmitigated spread followed relatively strict measure. Florida less unmitigated spread, strict measures.  China spray tan Requiring step foward waiting two weeks makes damn sense . know long takes mass produce monoclonal antibodies, although probably long 6 months, treating sick, need much vaccine.

For vaccine, going manufacturing promising several candidates ""at risk"" meaning approved. end failing trials, scrap doses made, pricey, government kicking billions purpose. So, promising vaccines actually work, run huge snags, plausible could begin vaccinating large numbers people late winter. winter. nice person. professionally, would say failed century test. Reasons: 1) seemed idea virus deal first months considering dedicated area whole life funded big 2) head NIH, permitted ( wouldn‚Äôt say engaged) risky operations running world potentially led disaster start drive children‚Äôs vaccines mean country somehow hope sanity next year, won‚Äôt rule late 2021. But. Otherwise, same. ""messes heartbeat,"" sounds clinical *fuck*. Well ""good news"" gestational diabetes generally reversed post-pregnancy catch quickly lasting damage done beta cells. eat aggressively low carb (think keto) while. Pain ass diet manage, especially already dealing postpartum issues, 6-8 months admittedly healthy annoying eating far preferable lifetime it, cascading health consequences diabetes.

Realistically people genetically predisposed diabetes run sooner later...age improve pancreas all...but longer ward off, happier it. second wave began three week ago. increase death cases. know safe. point trials find 50% effective.  Canadian checking in. look USA numbers day go sleep, somehow amazed every time. province hasn‚Äôt community spread Covid almost month now. Crazy different countries It‚Äôs gonna get higher while. Coming someone making posts 10K+ daily deaths martial law due covid....

Have noticed dramatic increase cases yet decline percentage deaths? absolutely reason Fauci lie. Hospitals direct suppliers equipment. They‚Äôre sending someone local drug store whenever they‚Äôre low PPE.

I think Fauci realizes fucked whole mask thing would things differently. least he‚Äôs standing ground public battle president trust Americans spite early missteps. ""lmao"" Here's happened:


""Raise hand want blame Fauci""


(Everybody does)


*looks polls*


""Oups... Raise hand want blame Navarro blaming Fauci ""


(Everybody does)


And go get reelected...


(Before say anything: alternate reality POTUS sells beans Oval Office... anything think impossible happen...)  Kemp absolutely that. suing whatever municipality / County / city tries enforce mask policy. Georgian, see lot people give shit sad.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: can't spell shit Worldometer +73,388. Wow America like neighbour that's crack travel Florida work sometimes vacation, treat 3rd world country visit. Everything public disposition abysmal know plan accordingly plan go. Imagine capitalism rescue. Companies worried people getting sick hurt bottom dollar right thing, say current leadership. know mean 'inflated'.

they took error previous 2 weeks booked additional cases today ( thats one way it)

as opposed retroactively going back adding them. won‚Äôt win votes though.  One could make argument mask wearing promoted adopted early, much bullshit happened might avoided. 

Japan, famous mask wearing, population 126MM something like thousand COVID deaths despite old people country planet. based many articles you‚Äôve read site month far. believe Bernard Shaw said ""Youth wasted young."" Rather apt, think. companies starting mandatory masks Monday, gonna r/publicfreakout gems seen. see massive Karen mask protest, could fun see. Remember, America guns accessible cheaper housing. Thanks appreciate it! guess 100k North America... 250k worldwide..

I got called evil. far we've come.. Phew. I‚Äôm sure must completely exhausted, I‚Äôm glad don‚Äôt wrangle trying decide school not. long terms unknown. 

In neighborhood kids riding bikes back-and-forth fun little masks every day (outdoors different families they‚Äôre careful) it‚Äôs really nice see go past. Almost normality. Pretty sure referring masks used surgeons doctors. necessary citizens

But non medical use masks plenty effective. Even ""just flu"" hell thinks another flu season okay?? think Walmart Amazon fail pay taxes? airline industry really can't make it? Maybe stop paying execs high salaries could stay business. think secret service jobs force politicians pay themselves? exactly would job? Bankers? mention, thousands dollars laying around can/want spend paying care catch covid get sick??? sigh. Yes. thought irony built comment :/  think probably many deaths like undocumented going right now... Right? kinda wish people's level chill.

Not virus. like, life general. really would. Sorry, know Fauci all? exact opposite moron. extra 600 week I've taken minor paycut, without I'll bringing 1k month plus 200 SNAP. need pay rent phone bill credit cards insurance. Without CARES act cannot survive unemployment. honestly idea I'm going do, industry complete standstill due coronavirus, literally everyone state field either furloughed administrative leave. wait lists minimum wage jobs. Next week last week I'm receiving check actually pay bills.

The CARES act ends next week. There's lot us going able survive without it. mountain evidence around 7 months YAAS MERICA' WORK!

Finally starting get it! 

Masks on, 1 apart, gather OUTSIDE, get tested. Beat virus. PLEASE!! Wait 77k? 
W h Musk alts clarify, said didn‚Äôt recommend wearing masks back April, healthcare workers, know people risking lives middle pandemic, facing large shortfall PPE; didn‚Äôt recommend normal people risk per outbreak time go buy masks crucially needed healthcare workers. 

But yeah, sure, he‚Äôs liar. He‚Äôs actually lied way leading NIH 4 decades 6 presidents, like how‚Äôs he‚Äôs blatantly lied way working HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases... Double Karen's... rare... don‚Äôt understand big words. helps use crayon. part didn‚Äôt suggest people make ad hoc masks didn‚Äôt compromise government‚Äôs trustworthiness. lol shit, curious see medical bill looks like. even insurance, thats gotta enough bankrupt wells fargo Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre getting downvoted, healthcare America for-profit private market. Business booming, people making money. Sure, individual nurses doctors may care patients and.. deaths etc shareholders sure fuck don‚Äôt. Would hell lot effective White House weren‚Äôt releasing propaganda false claims out-of-context video clips. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always warehouse jobs!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe grocery stores hiring!‚Äù Antibodies go away infection gone. totally normal. sure news honestly. matters cells b cells remember fight it. Studies still done that.  Oh common. That‚Äôs BS. I‚Äôm youngest family CS degree I‚Äôm early 60s. parents mid 80s. we‚Äôre certainly alone. us boomers good critical thinking skills filter nonsense say.

Where tested could get N95s you‚Äôre seeing news pieces front line workers saying masks, aprons, etc. Knowing know now, feel like idiot douche saying things four months ago? Someone post r/maskskepticism also report subreddit get banned. 

BTW great material homemade disposable masks shop towels. guy invented n95s talking effectiveness. kind headline this? fodder GOP supporters can‚Äôt trust liberal sources Business *are* receiving government loans right go business continue pay employees salary. give money workers instead job return over. limey supernova bullshit Thread?

And compare been, I‚Äôm surprised aren‚Äôt hated generation.

I wished they‚Äôd get back (if ever like that) USA needs 2 healthy parties function properly. Hypothesis: You‚Äôre incapable last word. one telling illinois it‚Äôs illegal wear mask carry gun, don‚Äôt around here. that‚Äôs case carve exemption police. see police wear masks Michigan July 4th video though. I've plumber fixing something home said (masks everybody, windows open) also keep distance course, left house went walk done cleaned/desinfected surfaces came back, maybe overkill felt safe me. 100% this. actually, goes countries. Even testing capability increases, unless people REALLY sick often avoid testing generally means get put 14 day self quarantine. mention, people go get tested people start becoming afraid might get testing site.

So ultimately end use hospitalizations better metric spread. Wrong, masks also protect wearer. agree work point, anecdotal experience, *a lot* people age (~22) going like nothing changed. much believe real bad, think apply want social. Fauci 60min saying United States reason people walking around Fauci admits public health officials misled public effectiveness want people worry coronavirus, danger ""just minuscule."" want take precautions ""influenza outbreak, second wave."" Risk coronavirus USA 'minuscule'; skip mask wash healthy young person, reason want go cruise ship, go cruise ship.‚Äù Anthony Fauci, Director  Nah, monster truck rallies fun.

The answer, according you, can‚Äôt. NY height all, MANY NYers showed here. And, according you, little spread. Instead, spread contributed local activity. tables turned, actions dictate future looks. travel state.

I‚Äôm simply reversing argument make point. state assholes NOTHING cases progress. true March-April Florida. also true July-August NY. actually went get food restaurant friends. packed, bar open, social distancing masks. like people wore masks outside table.

So tested 1 million people day covid 50 years ago would result? 700k cases? 5 cases? 

Do know testing according CDC? people experiencing symptoms **and or** around someone confirmed covid positive. 

The capacity test many people day place since Mid May.

If still understand wrote, think smaller country maybe 15 million people less.

When test (in days capacity) people experiencing symptoms around someone it.

I've seen CNN get some, course idiots say ""fake news"". 

I also see people say seeing people die streets, that's kind virus is. makes sick, slowly enough want stay home rest, go hospital, continue daily life usual.

So makes great point 99 vs. 100. death question counted, was, end, really matter. reason error likely tired staff miscoding death. Shit happens, they'll figure out.

It's last part, ""you could actually argue"", Right latch onto talk next two weeks. There's whole narrative days, death likely COVID death, make pandemic look worse is, hospitals get COVID money, hurt Trump, Gates, Fauci, conspiracy, blah blah blah. prime example they'll citing proof.

Really wish anyone mouthpiece public would aware they're saying may misinterpreted mis-extrapolated. would probably significant impact loony conspiracies framed correctly. Looks like it‚Äôs spreading even now. Even news becoming skeptical. *Sex Serfs*

So yea, version events, witnesses seem report support, actions little bit valid. evidence happens supposition didn‚Äôt allegedly start ‚Äúramming‚Äù someone blue someone verbally asked put mask on.

/s stand corrected; misremembered several months point. Still, refusing acknowledge ignoring warnings (as well data nations January/February contradicted China's claims early on) endangered us. They're political much ""health focused."" see you‚Äôre coming from. death rate 17% 80+ year olds &lt;0.2% &lt;30 year olds, young people get it, deaths won‚Äôt shoot (immediately). 

And, right. second surge first wave driven younger people making risky decisions. That‚Äôs 3 weeks case surge started, deaths began trickle up, slowly first.

But failed account lack wall young people old people. median age diagnosed cases Florida, touted ‚Äúonly 32‚Äù, 40. I‚Äôll let guess direction continue go.

Good luck. going need ever Sure funny multiple countries ""right"", fought viruses recent times. Jesus Christ site doesn‚Äôt define excess, states z values statistical calculation distance mean using standard deviations. Two standard deviations encompasses 95% results meaning score 2 indicates 5% possible outcomes could worse, meaning even z score 1.79 (which old data) would indicate worse death toll (it doesn‚Äôt seem seasonally adjusted) 90% possible outcomes, it‚Äôs one top 10% deadly weeks possible Sweden. That‚Äôs pretty fucking bad. Z score closer 0 would indicate less variation average. 

It‚Äôs simple math, interpretation would make z score 1 indication low variance, that‚Äôs literally outside entire standard deviation, worse 68% possible outcomes.

C.) Countries need incentivize good health habits ALSO removing incentives companies fill food manufacturing lines highly processed, sci-fi food shit... know it‚Äôs killing us. No, I'm socialist, I'm likely left you. honestly don‚Äôt even know start story. woman clearly doesn‚Äôt know anything Disney. 

First said wanted avoid Disney World busy instead went Hollywood Studios. Hollywood Studios one four parks makes WDW, it‚Äôs one two popular parks thanks Star Wars. Pre-Covid, everyone rushed HS hour opened could get virtual queue Rise Resistance, often ran within minutes. 

Then says Disney shut Hong Kong. not. international park operated Disney Disneyland Paris. Whatever Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong decided owners. 

Then claims Downtown Disney California park parks open. It‚Äôs shopping center. It‚Äôs different shopping center open. argue whether *should* open all, outlets open, open. 

The problem Disney isn‚Äôt can‚Äôt safely opened pandemic. think can. problem right now, things safe enough open it. I‚Äôm suggesting stay closed vaccine available, definitely open state finding 10k+ cases per day. 

Hong Kong Shanghai right (idk Tokyo open). *very* cases reopened they‚Äôre temporarily closing they‚Äôre small surge. also show green QR code get in, showing aren‚Äôt risk exposure, step that‚Äôs never going happen here. also seem lower park capacity WDW.

If hospitals began turning COVID patients away, wonder anti-maskers would still reckless health.  Yes is. non-essential people playing game.

Still barking old shit, hey? Good, trolled, masks increase chance getting sik. Comment repeat believe things told. concluded children less able spread virus

Like said, main belief it‚Äôs Netherlands didn‚Äôt overwhelming number COVID cases regardless children less able spread it. NYC perfect storm. also densest reliant public transportation city US.

District 11 specializes agriculture. located somewhere South large, possibly occupying nearly Deep South. people housed small shacks harsh force Peacekeepers. Common traits dark skin brown eyes.

Let alone something else. post made really good points risks individuals making assessment themselves. say equal loses nuance. benifits may weigh risks child family. there's way equal even stagnant risks. area surging verses low numbers risks shift.

Now aside, speaking educator, would high expectations learning year. teachers going struggling meet students emotional physical safety needs. Practically speaking, matter age student, week time going spent reviewing behavior expectations. Please tell banning valve masks. healthcare worker, immediately saw dumbest useless shit. completely defeats purpose mask letting air concentrated stream. young people gonna see say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs flu, bro!‚Äù Thanks. make sure wear mask, even go bathroom work (short distance) back office.

Since I've stopped hugging kissing talk people wearing mask (except family home) I'm way worried surface infections. Idk, think getting murdered, okay fight back EVEN THOUGH covid. Lol. Come on. That's like blaming people going work doctor spreading it. Unfortunately dont fucking choice, black community ask targeted way soooo Yes. Teachers expected buy materials complain comes territory teaching. add buy PPE whole level no.

 Nurses expose illnesses highly trained professionals deserve good pay also lost teacher pay compare health care providers paid. honesty idea risking health seem worth it. know grocery store workers people also risking lives huge amount pay. teaching already sort self sacrificial job give much energy resources exhaust sort way grocery store work exhaust. already stressful profession sucks life you.

If you‚Äôre going landlord selective rent . one poor credit one who‚Äôs got eviction record . old days used easier take risk potentially unsound tenants could arrange something like 4 month deposit etc . days renting laws really tie people‚Äôs hands makes working something possible . 

The thing remember low income tenants screw , like say wreak apartment, they‚Äôre judgment proof assets sued . 

If really want rent low income individuals focus Section 8 housing . 

The section 8 tenants follow certain rules like destroying property,paying time etc , fail follow section 8 rules lose assistance don‚Äôt want risk . 

The great thing section 8 tenants stop paying share Rent , section 8 still continues pay lions share rent they‚Äôre . dad says he's done research needs understand situation, know Florida's numbers hoax. means read headline misreported data one propaganda articles someone shared...

Meanwhile, parents state freaking schools open early August, refusing distance learning (because money distance learning accessible working internet place get libraries like closed still here, that's possible).

Can tell we're frustrated? Wild idea uneducated:

Could factor child infection rates, kids ""mild cases"" COVID-19? Ah yes JD.

He's still office November/January yet, keep lol Unless show channel watching consider 'fake news'. Karens go straight jail. pass Go. collect unemployment check... Commitment could work little time That's unimportant!   
But special circumstances need sacrifices important activities, temporarily.

Btw, comparing concert visit museum stupid. well visit museum safely masks handwashing.   
For concert, much difficult overcrowding, heat, need frequently drink water (or beer).... okay ask didn‚Äôt homework? Lack computer?  Parents threatening juvenile detention safer? Learning disability? Substance abuse problems?

Or obstinate?

Now like walking directly fire. Let guess school goes weeks person everyone like ""shit, working all"" everything rushed online. But.. stonks goes up? Dont forget 100k+ herd medical debt. BLM protesters wearing masks, social distancing behaving like graduation party walking road. going make huge difference infection rates Right?? won‚Äôt truly know cases start dropping miraculously. That‚Äôs literally way know enough people it. 4 family members got tested positive COVID week ago. 3 less 4 days symptoms mild headache congestion, 4th still sick mostly feeling run down, feeling better days ago. see evidence anyone cares enough cancel it. It‚Äôs summer time it‚Äôs Texas... it‚Äôs HOT! trucks delivering ICE CREAM!!! Duh!!! lot discussion media lately ""antibodies last"", looked research, say Wuhan study widely cited media based *estimated* cases, actually follow confirmed positive cases. couple studies really small sample sizes. study far best methodology similar papers seen, actually follow up, also large sample size, given caused global pandemic millions infected numerous fatalities. Questions regarding robustness, functionality longevity antibody response virus remain unanswered. report vast majority infected individuals mild-to-moderate COVID-19 experience robust IgG antibody responses viral spike protein, **based dataset 19,860 individuals** screened Mount Sinai Health System New York City. also show titers stable least period approximating three months, anti-spike binding titers significantly correlate neutralization authentic SARS-CoV-2. data suggests **more 90% seroconverters make detectible neutralizing antibody** responses titers stable least near-term future.


Edit: also decent evidence cell immunity take antibodies detectable, see Also, long-term memory cells expected generate antibodies body attack again, bit soon see research that. seriously going claim literal child broke quarantine offend people don‚Äôt like Donald Trump?

You‚Äôre absolutely ridiculous. mean immunity doesnt exist, fucked people end giving up. cant beat virus social distancing, stay. hate judge book cover didn‚Äôt look smart beginning.. ü§ß  Maybe. doesnt work say either.

 separate groups infected infected people group u proposed u test groups separately, dogs would tell 6 people infected 92 non infected people 7 infected people 8 total.
So 100 people group would 13 people identified infected dogs. would miss one infected missidentify 6 people healthy infected. see it.

Idk math correct im certain isnt. defense Bill Gates: plans leaving basically money kids full time job saving world. He's shipped millions vaccines worldwide try eradicate polio malaria HIV provide treatment diseases. works TB treatment provides financial skill classes small businesses lift communities poverty. train farmers techniques tools increase food output. provide medical supplies world help family planning familes expand beyond family's ability care help bring food grow job markets literally trying save world, one family time.

The man made billions puts money mouth is. wife pass basically goes trust foundation kids. Nope. Charity. kind changes communities long term bandages look pretty right now.

I hate seeing Bill Gates middle every conspiracy theory criticize billionaires hoarding wealth- he's one throwing giving back gets dragged it. No, he's injecting microchips. He's helping families confrol family size ten half starved children helping farmers grow food family wants ten kids there's food ten growing small scale industry people find work grow economies making sure every child born vaccines die preventable deaths.

Bill Gates exactly every multibillionaire be. Annoys people act like he's antichrist sending yellow fever vaccines overseas children die tries stop famine disease ability so. Hell person classes pipe dream got chose stupidity. Nothing more.

Darwinism work IMO Stupid everywhere agree, originated Florida pretty much South. selling caskets too? Yeah surreal watching video response local leaders wanted head. basically Trump campaign ad aside thinks masks necessary. every person dies, FAR 19 survived.

Suggesting 19 survive per death suggest 5% infected die.

This clearly case. Actual infections clearly FAR higher confirmed cases.

Every statistic mention, without source, questionable. Long term impacts yet understood. guy villain.

The outcome makes smile. That's end athletic careers US experienced excess deaths compared previous yearly averages, even factoring recorded covid deaths. It‚Äôs right statistics deaths causes. Anybody pushing ideas counting deaths telling truth. first week March, remained quarantine mid May (until end April mom still tested positive).

We great now, lasting symptoms/effects, healthy (my parents runners, 2/3 marathoners every year, sister walks 15 km every day, walk 8 km). Somebody brother's job tested hot. Cleaned station breakroom. Still making people wear masks. alleged ""good news"" based reality. Many sites taking false misleading coronavirus posts. would hope reddit would follow suit bar pie sky preprints. misleading title. ‚ÄúUS taking it‚Äù. global pharmaceuticals corps selling new medicine USA first reap massive profit US healthcare system doesn‚Äôt much way price control oversight.

That French company got railed suggesting treatments would go US first profit maximization. So, understanding OSHA self funded. people can't self fund shutting job sites, want hand fines. also large amount hiring late last year, need collect lot cash year.

My question people relying OSHA local health departments. That's contacted case job site I'm currently on. handled all. comes hospitals think would even case.

Dunno, seems little OSHA's lane. Stop facts. new normal republicans don‚Äôt wear masks idiots (true), Democrats hate Russia loving communism, Democrats believe Chinese propaganda. Stunning. certain amount buy-in ordinary citizens implement lockdown, buy-in exist point.

When everybody knows somebody who's seriously ill dead, buy in. watch happening real time. Celebrities politicians tweeting anti-mask lockdown bullshit stumbling backwards kids diagnosed day lockdowns sold temporary thing reduce cases take heat hospitals, indefinite thing that's living when, 2021? 2022?

Or, like fucking moderately functional anti-pandemic action taken countries, would brief effective lockdown followed careful safe reopening. quarter measures rushed reopenings US. *wouldn't* indefinite lockdowns years handled over. *will* indefinite never get shit together handle we're still democracy, move China want that, though.

I meant forced situation. workplace cannot stay physically open there's outbreak amung staff. Keep weird US democracy fantasization elsewhere, citizen modicum control lives politicians represent anything people believe here. Fuck i'm cooking meth!

Oh wait. I'm confused article. headline says states, article says ""...but states‚Äî32, exact‚Äîreported Tuesday new residents testing positive virus Canada did."" Where's 18? Anyone clarify? long day maybe missed something confused anyway.  knows think, go senseless arguments make put fellow Americans peril ""own Conservatives"" like side people proud of. Squirt guns full bleach Yes kind difficult see actions causing influencing various rises falls. 

I think majority people BLM demonstrations wearing masks. many studies shown outdoors less likely increase infection indoors.

But also see cases going open beaches. theory people actually get infected sitting beach open air getting infected go restaurants indoors coastal towns etc. 

So much analyze. 10 years we'll 1000 books written this. reply literally nothing said lol Well deserved guilt. small bit justice. afraid tanking economy hundred thousand (or millions) people dying suffering, especially since many suffering happen black brown.

Become famous rich    -   american dream! Let's see. Disorderly conduct, trespassing name few. Make examples. Max fine, 30 days hole. They'll figure out. people already got $1200 get last 5 months. fine. /s Since thousands scientists saying let hopes vaccine *fade*, people clearly feel better insight scientists.

With long-dwindled factual statements like: **T CELL**, sincerely doubt better insight. Keep mind, there's pretty darn rural counties CA. counties spiking manner

I disagree you, see decision. He's trying cause chaos Atlanta hoping virus spreads heavily election may affected. Frats going major source covid. University Washington 120 cases related rush, anecdotes indicate many got sick opted get tested. likely large part uptick Seattle/King County seen recent weeks kids went community.

Really want see major universities across country. ashamed, vote aginst participate in/organize protests Kemp.

only ashamed those.  like little engine could.....Spreading death dismay. train dogs already scent dogs fairly quickly. Bomb sniffing drug sniffing dogs repurposed easily this. lol Well, probably read article making note, inclusion persons without laboratory-confirmed diagnosis dilute hydroxychloroquine effect significant interaction PCR-confirmed disease (nonsignificant 5.2% relative improvement) PCR-confirmed disease (nonsignificant 14.7% relative improvement) (*P* interaction¬†= 0.51). Mitch McConnell thankfully become loud-and-proud supporter mask-wearing, honestly makes AG's actions mind-boggling me. ...I mean, is. know deaths per week declined every week 11 straight weeks despite rapid increase positive tests. okay.. yea patch work response moronic. suppose republican thing complete lack leadership. strongest nation earth bungle badly. I'm saddened entire event. suffering/loss life American people gone through.. go like this. one deaths! would worry much. many factors would right infected. falls dosage specifics children, always different. also extremely rare, whereas covid not. may stated unintentionally inferring due saying biologically different. They're smaller human beings pretty much everything applies adults applies them. may vary severity, directions, they're susceptible things Life hack, live US, state (DC).

Now DC got statehood, COVID cases would go up!! (sarcasm obviously) take public money deny public orders time. country fucked. people worst. Im glad someone like though.  Yeah, problem even beds ICUs vents, need bodies staff them. Maskholes. Deaths lowest per week US since Mid April.

Positive cases way way up.

Deaths way way down. don‚Äôt understand words written. Sure I‚Äôd rather super yacht 1300 sqft house. Thankful roof head job WFH though, there‚Äôs levels shit. Give us Ann Sacoolas, talk who‚Äôs bad guy Masks provide decent degree self-protection, *main* effectiveness keeping spit droplets (which contain virus) contained face rather spreading around air surfaces. protect public individuals wearing them. think glad live America.. get wrong, surely beautiful country, mentality fucking scary went walk 80s lex randalls island - 3.5 miles roundtrip.  walk 3-4 times week. went 70-80% wearing masks 4 weeks ago 20-30% wearing masks today....and mean wearing mask correctly. play game many consecutive people pass wearing masks. gets double digits frequently. nyc .3% death rate virus. meaning almost .3% residents died virus...one would think people would put masks densest city America...even outside. got lobby, two employees one tenant wearing mask. one wearing mask...its frustrating. want go back sitting apartment 24/7 .... woman almost ninety, would trust steady hands sword. Thank god Karens sacrificing protect way life. /s Covid isn‚Äôt influenza? thought gonna start basketball Florida would like playing forest fire right now. Plus truncated baseball season starting soon probably go well either. see skip preseason four games yet regular season, nothing going change covid going anywhere. even get started college football like religion people. schools a.) beach near instead middle crowded neighborhoods cities, b.) bug infested area mention sunburns dehydration young children would become major issue c.) hurricanes common 50/50 whether would rainy day not.

Plus, doubt get many teachers signing outside kids day long outdoor teaching. think that's feasible 90+ degree days 80% higher humidity December. go stores require masks. feel safer shopping wave retailers requirements started, spent money. can't alone this, think retailers actually benefit decisions, temper tantrums ""Karens/Chads"" notwithstanding. can‚Äôt see lockdowns working everywhere, areas would non compliant cross state lines. hotspots would shift around. Also someone make sure get lost go bathroom mean, long deaths keep decliing like every week since April 18th. Maybe, properties California typically worth much Texas? bigger silliness it‚Äôs even freedom give up. right business. Cloudflare outage. Might related. comparisons Sweden useless, many factors soon. everyone agenda delivered oneliners memes. 

But schools children age 16 open whole time. far child ill enough intensive care.

Another interesting thing BLM demonstrations month ago trigger bump hospitalizations. mostly teens? outside? knows.

The thing trusted statistics.

And keeping distance! People masks relax stand close time. Ha. sure wasn‚Äôt crying? sound sometimes! don‚Äôt want go back work it‚Äôs safer home middle out-of-control pandemic. thanks! county offer 50$ rewards reporting people w/photos. better option would impose fine $10000 businesses,offer 1000$ reward reporting businesses allow people without mask. dont deal bullshit dealing forcing people wear them. cut civilized society. Florida literally still day, what's makes them? industry wrecked. would love go back work. possible. Regular unemployment pay bills. government allow industry go back normal need compensate. 

What do? Beg papa Bezos work fulfillment center $12 hour also pay bills? Animal kingdom tons walk ways purposely made narrow people packed give illusion south Asian city. Coronavirus SUCK children can't behave. I've encountered argument comparing Texas New York. told Texas lying numbers lower. can't call someone liar agree preferred outcome. debating adding ""/s"" decided to. Glad sarcasm came across. necessarily blame anyone NYC initial northeast US outbreaks, every new death 100% result poor federal government response, joke. understand looked greatest nation world could bungle much have. Testing results taking days, federal mask mandates, confusing messaging allowing MAGA crowd push conspiracies. irony administration shooting foot efforts fix economy. way that's true ignore attacks committed whites - seems bit dishonest. I'm gun owner support gun reform country. Im big supporter banning assault rifles. Simple things like required training gun safety, extensive background checks, psyche evaluations etc alot ask for. put mildly. we're ""at least killing them... we're silencing them."" stage denying Corona still trying angry country's fake numbers. people assumption get whiny bitches men. can‚Äôt take called miserable closeted cry baby brats. Fair enough. I‚Äôve thought getting advanced care stuff like pumps new testing methods, hate idea wearing pager that‚Äôs permanently attached me. Feel like nurses shouldn‚Äôt making less someone working secondary position call center. Hope gets raise. :) Australia police fine partygoers $1600 bullshit like this. feeling small minority pushing insane thinking, weaseled way power. CDC says ineffective.

No, not. one study researchers Hong Kong. covid, influenza. 

So again, CDC given guidance everyone shoudl wear masks public. said lie. Again, blatant dishonesty.

And again, skipped another thing. tried imply CDC contradicted (due one stylist infecting other) **because showed masks work, contradiction**.

Cherry picking, ignoring inconvenient facts, hypocritical positions changes suit predetermined position. problem honesty. I'm really sorry tricked going neighbors this. tough thing realize even admit expect hope turns around you. worth anything I'm healthcare worker I've close family member die covid19. know probably change mind sway way maybe get consider taking neighbors perspective seriously. want economy come back. That's important stay vigilant safe. careless downplaying situation hurt us long run. Including you. get from? Old people stupid. Like really, really stupid. funny thing prices often everywhere else.  think currently paying interest loans school. like took loans planning paying hoping forgiven. *That* would irresponsible. mean can't wish sort student loan forgiveness program implemented eventually.  quite threat Ohio especially! Fatality rate dropping steadily real worry ICU beds run staff/supplies get exhausted death rate climb dramatically. 

That entire point flattening curve.  **AND** believe made are... probably right positively believe Interesting see Louisiana never learned much consistently around top board. Man home state Texas fallen... would far past every state reporting work science pal. know rare, possible side effects. Quit fucking assuming.  True, always filter area. 

Check /r/COVID19 information virus. Yeeeep. literally population exists utility resource, don‚Äôt think theres conclusion come to...in totality, isn‚Äôt sovereign nation following ideologies culture freedom haha. think place elite exploit consumerism, applying carrot stick tactics orchestrate reaction cattle inevitably wealth extravagance. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs like omniscient control would ideal, totalitarians viewpoint mean. want start company, develop software, become famous musician, that‚Äôs possible. average person rise moderate wealth. person become commodity elite capitalize of? two party system another PERFECTLY supportive concept keeps running efficiently...I don‚Äôt think grow without looking around realizing variation I‚Äôm describing true. It‚Äôs everywhere. insistence normalization upon idols / idolization (and colossal distraction comes it...Britney spears, Late Night, Ellen, whatever). Implied necessity university / college creates massive debt government openly pay join military...not even learning actual history settlers coming here. Bits pieces get. 5th grade made ceramic cornucopias learned natives pilgrims rejoiced that‚Äôs it. 6th grade learned civil rights. 8th grade hear Trail Tears. fuckkk didn‚Äôt learn CIA sending letters MLK, 1,000,000 atrocious acts US haha...the nationalism sanctified, too, thoroughly anyone questioned entitlement US deploy station seas...if don‚Äôt celebrate veterans blindly? that‚Äôs heresy 
There‚Äôs sea film, music, art days churned repetitive trash, analytics much widely available. data everywhere. art blew people away, parts caused biggest buzz copy pasted gross $$$. 


this isn‚Äôt country it‚Äôs Westfield mall. what‚Äôs crazy actually doesn‚Äôt diminish actual lightning bottle people there, passion determination love talent struggle etc etc. whether sickening facade, everyone participating that. really still makes sick. yes republicans definitely win gross boi wars. sorry rant I‚Äôm totally defeated nowhere else rant rn. feel like probs kms country fucked Reality killing people believing help. disbelieving reality may get governor re-elected. Well worker safety also many people workers come contact every day.  wearing masks obviously customers it‚Äôs pointless . Also, keep plague rats state. Agreed. Abuse likely. vigilant since beginning. leave house essentials 1 day week. wear mask everywhere.  much bad shit become bad person count? One murder, 10?

The little shit didnt accidently make decision. chose asshole. Funny businesses power this, yet politicians can‚Äôt seem get anything done.  conditions met? I've come conclusion stance taken republicans respect Covid healthy people US. Oof. understand infections 1000 people.

There comment above, says Canada population US kept rate, would 1.1 millions cases. US 3.5 millions rises everyday Reddit Enhancement Suite, turn ""filteReddit"" add keywords like ""Youtuber"" ""Jake Paul."" post titles containing keywords hidden page! fair, needs honest science based explanation masks.

Absolutely true typical cloth masks made random material block virus. understanding blocking spit/fluids getting mouth/nose , effectively helps prevent spread since virus lives fluids. idea seems prevent viral loads high, since evidence seems suggest high viral loads cause infections. know pictures videos current result Covid 19? could time Sars disease

If anything, defeats point even more. wore masks avoid catching diseases, diseases longer among us - means masks pretty effective, it?

But self-awareness realize contradict thoughts. Im messing man. went received master's good state school last ten years I'm close level student loans. Honestly considering going back getting law degree I've heard cyber security law needed that's career been. sad reason fear debt surrounds it. Side note, took LSAT finished first degree without studying able get 156. great months worth practicing would like think could get 160s. Really wish would gone school Europe would free. contradicting yourself: first claim early make judgement T-cells, lines later say they're unlikely impactful antibodies bulk fighting infections. 

We also know levels antibodies needed immune coronavirus, yet claim low antibody levels mean immunity. 

I'm ""alluding"" anything, posted two article experts say, citing scientific studies, antibody test could give us partial picture who's immune long, decline antibodies natural infection mean vaccine useless. 
I think particularly outrageous hypothesis, could well wrong- wrote ""this necessarily mean..."" ""it's possible"" reason. 

Only time tell wheter people coronavirus get infected again, long severely. friends TN start back next week. always start back insanely early. Well, absolutely zero doubt choice enroll kids online learning year. going hurt many families. answer question. repeated amount deaths America. concerned Trump killing children. many children gotten virus died it? Go Vermont!!! God forbid give financially susceptible bare fucking minimum get shitshow pandemic fucks power propagated. That's completely factually wrong. chicken pox child increases risk developing shingles later life. Pox parties never right thing do. impossible get 600. Yes first world. That‚Äôs privileged are. Calling US anything first world epitome sheltered privilege make sense millionaire celebrities talking...

They stick preferred topics interest... themselves. Stun guns!  Okay bad example, 1968 influenza let's even talk Spanish flu...I mean waaay worse. 

Fantastic, shit good anyway. Speaking Mr. Rogers, another reason miss Republican, old school thus anti-science like loons today.

I'm sure he's rolling grave knowing Trump leader party. Dystopia love meme! WoW FTW! Yeah, YouTube I‚Äôve seen talk Markiplier would fraud, would ready able work. /r/conspiracy always like either. They've gone mix questioning government mix harmless alien stuff parroting government talking points research critical thinking. sub must named slowly ruined both. Abuse decilpin. abuse. Simply telling kids follow strict rule goes long way (instead hitting head). Along humans That‚Äôs mean...all unemployment gonna need paid back..and don‚Äôt know people able to. could face whole nother economic recession.  shortage Trump belivers. One senators doesn‚Äôt think people 18 get Covid, Ted Cruz. MURICA !! true SARS-CoV-2, means could reduced rate transmission. would very, bad. 

Yup, that's every expert saying brace fall continue increase contact tracing. Places opened safely may find need increase restrictions Rt rises change season. 

As say here, ""Attache ta tuque avec d'la broche!"" (Attach tuque steel wire.) many people making money going work, removes incentive work, potentially allows people load regular spending outside potentially earn eventually forced back work.

For much working class, think last point important one good reason end high unemployment payouts soon possible. understand thought came number begin with, would nice moved way make sure different people got needed relative CoL. It‚Äôs illegal wear something religious government building, it‚Äôs illegal you‚Äôre authority position, please stop spreading misinformation figure make due. Maybe get smaller apartment one fewer amenities farther away. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôd decide know lots people kids legit scrapping poverty wages figure out. want kids, kids! Maybe priorities shift / shift you‚Äôll find money there.

Also, refinance loans. Education loans getting super good rates now. agree won‚Äôt severe could see 2-3k cases average day reopening. sure expected threshold continue reopening. One intelligent comment ever seen threads like that. totally correct, US's number infections still rising fast (nearly 80k day now) Hats good doctor. man speaks like real live Aes Sedai. never says word knows untrue, yet truth speaks often different truth people think hear say. slip once, asked ""droplet vs aerosol, prevalent?"" immediately said ""mostly aerosol"" immediately correcting himself. 

It defintely appears western ruling bodies deliberately downplaying airborne spread vector, likely believe would make people panic. began downplaying day China confirmed aerosol transmission February (that whole ""aerosols generated procedures like intubation"" narrative), gradually introducing narrative, taking great care direct attention elsewhere - like way said obviously presymptomatic/asymptomatic asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission USS Roosevelt, started one index patient, spread quickly one guy coughing nearly 1000 sailors. 

In fact, almost seems like instructed downplay airborne transmission route, instead deliberately described situation aircraft carrier words ""asymptomatic presymptomatic transmission"" sounded like awkwardly swapped place ""airborne transmission"" last second. followed orders letter yet managed choose words put attention left unsaid. man certainly way words. /u/DreamSofie correct downvoted. several studies indicating HIV-like properties COVID-19 fact emphasis shifting towards cocktail. one study retracted mean theory dead-end; that's science works. 

Remember new ideas comes 3 stages: First ridiculed, vehemently denied, finally accepted obvious. I'm pretty sure I've seen people refer male Karens Kens - guys also Kyle Chad names predate Karen name (they mean slightly different things, obviously). think extremely odd people point more, right sense personality exclusive one gender. None are. amount impact measures taken Texas higher, still insufficient. would surprised Florida perform worse coming weeks. thinking along lines fine, violated parole etc etc read comment. Thanks pointing out. People say stuff clue current work done vaccines. assumption vaccines going face stringent testing borders antivaxx nonsense talk. 

Then mostly going herd think. People think way usually follow herd. soon favorite celebrity takes vaccine goes twitter saying got it, they'll follow. 

Follow science. can't interpret science. learn interpret science. Otherwise even taking vaccine help life. enforcing masks? /s growth rate suggests perhaps post-haste.  Target also requires mask üò∑ discussion lockdown skeptic. deaths would increasing lot mid July late July early August. said think bud. really feel good data trending way thought would. That's reasonable position. anti-vaccer position not. Well already passed 2 trillion bill months ago spent hundreds billions PPP, $ 600 weekly federal unemployment. can‚Äôt keep printing money forever velocity money goes back normal see face-ripping hyperinflation Funny Orwellian social manipulation kind way.

so ok government lying everyone else, ""get what's up"". since other's smart are, ""need"" lied to? must love Trump then. like explain think lied reason mask guidance.

Schools part government. they're dropping ball like rest government has. 4 months get everything together open safely, use time effectively. remember recently reading article watching video information details went head would unlikely. Lol Ah misread title, deaths good. cases isn‚Äôt! COVID infections sea shining sea mean literally like we're invade Canada kick land? risk really shouldn‚Äôt forced sacrifice life. applying jobs exclusively remote less risky environment. Trust me, swine flu back 2009 nearly killed 18 time. I‚Äôm going gamble COVID-19 lung condition. mother sister nurses know exactly virus entails. sub always shithole. Pretty sad considering pandemic actually serious. Go r/COVID19 real discussion. Similarly one issue cut it, besides, think saw source linked.  Stay safe wear mask going end dead it‚Äôs simple that. there‚Äôs bargaining discrimination virus. ever movie Covid, must played Brad Pitt! AZ, GA, TX FL need ventilators. It‚Äôs gotten point people need die new patient admitted hospitals states. new deaths.

Unfortunately number new cases increasing (average 114 July 7th July 13th, closer 80 lowest point). high schools universities closed early still closed. Athens hospitals forcing nurses submit wrong tests ensure negative results also fuuuucked up

Wait what? actual fuck? Holy shit, Florida. Or... wait it, recommendations FoHM time? Except travels recommended anymore, except unnecessary public transport travel).  responsible people common sense America teach us fight corona stay humble. Thanks doc Thanks kind sentiment. German however, grumbly one that, argued earlier stricter lockdown March.  
  
The US slipped far social standards expect citizens here, getting hard make rational comparisons.  
  
It seems like determined resurrect manifest destiny? Dude, clearly Fauci ObViOuSlY JoKInG That‚Äôs means told 2 day waiting period go drive testing, 7-10 days results.

Almost everyone getting back Stockholm feels crowded summers, less tourists, much locals. strategy work Sweden USA? wearing masks?  doesn‚Äôt care never never meet go Russia. ain‚Äôt deep.

This they're testing recoveries, anyone ever coronavirus labelled died it. may better wait - announcing prematurely probably increase mask wearing oh i'm sorry, health condition, think even anxiety qualifies? That's rich coming tool. intentional?

dense mf  Anecdotally speaking parents, healthcare professionals, tested positive relatively early (early April) 'recovered' relatively quickly, mum making near full recovery days. dad however, said last week started feeling 100%,and feeling absolutely exhausted physical activity, 3 months recovery. !RemindMe 6 months heck good news? catastrophe still aiming this. know still operating data lag, scandal own.

Every single country lag covid-19 death reporting. AFAIK, get sick, carry definitely stick fur (droplets). Washing soap water much easier compared washing dogs. say dog lover, owner, thankful adopt one, amount washing needed would drive dog crazy. would retrain him/her pee poop house would messy.

TL;DR: get sick, fomites. Also, imagine would happen spending people bit financial security 18k? definitely, 100% get ""trickle up"" economics. 

Consumer confidence extremely low. anyone buying car right now? That's rhetorical obviously are, imagine industry completely tanked past months. 

But give families bit security, peace mind, spending money? Better believe sold plenty cars (cars example.) Looks like comparing intramuscular shot vaccine vs intranasal dose.

USA: still want medals, watch us go! feel opposite. Trump presidency longest century lifetime Man, charts really tell story. Yes, we're used looking ""total new cases beginning"" curve, specifically Mobility Testing charts show what's really going on. 

For example:

- FL, see people basically stayed home 2 weeks, even total commitment. 
- then, look testing curve: # tests %positive following other. That's really fucking bad. 
- Compare MA: mobility near 0% almost entire month
- massive negative correlation # tests %positive: tests skyrocketed held, % positive went way down

I know hear stuff news etc think we'd living high tension fear state times, mostly day-to-day life maybe quarter people see wearing masks. everywhere go distancing templates strategies, mostly ignored one really seems mind.

The casual nature scares much. Kiddo's daycare closed mid-March May making motions repeat now, even though obviously much serious situation happening now.

for context.  would risk life extra cash need cash? See, make scenario mind make sense something physically happened. False positives rare tests. False negatives far common. writing wall months. problem people refuse ask one simple question; wrong? I'm wrong, nothing. wrong, ooohhh boy.  Ha, love understand poor behavior political rivals.... economy shrank freaking .3%.

This Q1 numbers, Covid hardly getting countries went lockdown looking 25% shrinkage.

This looking future.

Those two numbers comparable far soon judge effect countries economies. Especially using Q1 numbers. statistic professions affected, bad might seem. 

I looked Swedish report confirmed infected different professions. Swedish testing low, confirmed tested probably strong symtoms. school children young teens stayed open, interesting see dangerous closed room children day.

School teachers ""average risk"" getting corona (1.1 times average). Taxi public transport dangerous ones, 4-5 times average. Median age around 50 professions. 

Generally service professions deals adults dangerous, children safe, young children really safe (preschool 0.7 average).

Though pregnancy risk, babies toddlers extremely unlikely affected. 5000 dead Sweden, none 20, first child intensive care would make national news, far happened. sure looking forward August 2nd shit show over. yes, reinfection confirmed now.

Where? pickle it. I'm super familiar bit. stated part confronted information. get angry shout MAGA skies 4:17am? looks like chad poor nothing left eat, eat rich. lot tests often change anything. positive/negative test would change somebody lot cases. thoughts exactly. Congress needs pass something citizens rush Capital Hill. Holy crap. even possible.

Here France, girlfriend got tested yesterday 11:45 am, results 8pm. Free charge. Wait, trailing positive rate needs viewed together number tests conducted mean u saying (same guy u replying to). also need viewed testing method. dramatically lower positive rate going testing potential cases testing random population. none u really provided decent picture whether testing sufficient right now. Fauci good man. One first help patients AIDS Ebola. He's worked 6 presidents complaints reality TV star came picture.

So yeah I'm gonna call BS say lying. every statement factually wrong designed downplay effects SARS children. 

I honestly know drawer buried morality in, gone. Long gone. 

Stop spreading lies lead death children. Oh, absolutely bullshit. Athens hospitals forcing nurses submit wrong tests ensure negative results also fuuuucked up. think meant we're shunning-healthcare-workers levels crazy. think. we? yeah imagine may also still standing enclosed area waiting line places poor air movement. 

Personally, intentionally standing line 30 minutes next covid-19 positive person go amusement park ride sound like something would want do. Even mask, whatever expelling build air little air movement. point still stands, people alive Sweden, today, historical all-cause death numbers past 20 years flu seasons would predict, even include covid-19 deaths, 5600 them.

That true.

However, US reporting deaths Sweden need adjust number +30% comparable, real death tolls actually quite similar atm. Sweden epidemic control falling numbers since April. US hand spiralling me! One month. both? way possibly deny uptick deaths weeks COVID Sweden.

Never denied Deaths COVID entered weeks relevant discussing COVID deaths.

True, I'm specifcally discussing all-cause deaths. problem arguing something else think I'm claiming.

My point still stands, people alive Sweden, today, historical all-cause death numbers past 20 years flu seasons would predict, even include covid-19 deaths, 5600 them.

Because ever year, Sweden, 90000 people die, 5600 deaths year flu season extremely mild, simply enough bump cumulative total significantly average.

2020 likely significantly disastrous year Sweden, total deaths. disaster would total number deaths significantly average, look like that. disaster would significantly higher number dead children adults, leading massive loss QALY, happen either.

Is 5600 people dead covid-19 bad? Yes, absolutely. national disaster that's going re-shape society generations? Absolutely not. cards contactless payments too, dont need use phone. point makes even less sense means admit Trump wrong can‚Äôt upset Daddy minute, thought written nail *in* face mask.

And said, still higher mortality numbers peers staying home locking still safest option all.   kind happened got latent tuberculosis. crazy thing never spread lungs. immune system took care became contagious variety thank God. number body's systems. remember sometimes would lay ground body suddenly weighed 1000 pounds. bizarre. Took years feel back normal whatever closer normal. even know knew went another country came back sick. found years later.

Hang there! know latent TB Corona virus case eventually started feel better hope you. decision reversed. soon gonna great case covid  Imagine entire country afflicted chronic fatigue syndrome. NY 60% positivity rates days. enough bandwidth actually get real number, considering actually 1 million people infected NY based random sampling, real cases dramatically higher what's known. Admit it: thought handsome. Probably test gravity real not!? article available everywhere. Care share points? Yep. People forget vials syringes actually *give* people vaccine. already predicting shortages.

Governments pushing companies make stuff, way companies ramp production enough meet demand. Heck, still enough PPE, especially places surge time. Well certainly seems taken lead COVID-19 response leader. use reference POTUS states doing. Yeah - somehow determine vaccines aren‚Äôt possible, we‚Äôd obviously SOMETHING eventually meeting conclude rate...  mistake, Surgeon General said ‚Äú[you increase chance getting coronavirus wearing CDC measured said people sick didn‚Äôt need wear mask. least India excuse overpopulated underdeveloped infrastructure comes spread virus. Tip don‚Äôt want wear whole time hike. around neck pull whenever someone approaches. God damn Reginald Johnston, Duke Reddit, 1st Earl Cornwall-upon-Thames. fire today. actually went ""blind"" times. eyes working, like brain process information, makes sense.

I've also times like ""just woke up"", somewhere idea got there. One time grocery store weekly grocery shopping cart full items. happened maybe 4 5 times. stopped riding bike alone it, lately GF riding gravel trails.

Most though general fogginess, confusion. Also get angry lot stupid shit never bothered me. personality definitely changed bit.

Fortunately, seem long term. last serious effect like 2 weeks ago. like slowly subsided time, seemingly went away. sick March, never hospitalized. time, basically bad sore throat crazy headache heart shady things.

But, seem asthma now. Going back doctor get checked out. Pedantic Evidence assertions, also stupid. venn diagram people pro-life suddenly started using 'my body, choice' justification propogate plague circle.

This absolutely insane. know happen: transmission increase, people die, economy ruined. people truly think virus disappear close eyes think baseball something? ""If run asshole morning, ran asshole. run assholes day, ~~the asshole~~ working white house."" 

-Raylan Givins Really? see lot people wearing masks indoors outdoors close others, also see lot ""dick noses."" Close half people seen grocery stores worn mask nose. makes want scream. Republicans want dead.

This needs repeated over. message needs spread. give two fucks you. prevailing theory COVID-19 specifically pneumonia-prone virus seemingly airborne blood disease... possible latent effects lowered SpO2 levels? ambiguity many reopening plans frustrating. also offer details things like band, orchestra, chorus, extracurricular activities.

They Spring &amp; Summer plan clear School Boards nothing speak teachers &amp; parents, hoping things would okay. Compilation 70 studies metanalysis masks effectivness : Ha! I'm disagreeable yet started wear masks early on. whole there‚Äôs never better time alive 


Doesn‚Äôt help really point, whatever. experimental parts trials overly rushed, part rushed compressing paperwork (approval organization phase III trials normally take year more, Oxford team weeks), unprecedented move running trial production side side, research evidence comes good, hit shelves right away, fails everything would tossed.

(I've posted part before, people said helpful, I'm posting again:)

When people say vaccine really accelerated normally takes many years develop vaccines, correct, forget history. early vaccines like smallpox rabies easy doctor could work months make rudimentary vaccine. Jenner (smallpox) Pauster (rabies) succeeded basically first attempt, despite year 1800's knowledge. hard problems left over, like HIV, hard low hanging fruits picked centuries ago. Covid brand new virus, could easy smallpox hard HIV, far looks like got lucky going one easier ones (at least, way easier SARS1, animals suffered massive allergic reactions first vaccine candidate. animal experiment part Covid vaccine went really well.) vaccines talk recent years takes decades research toughest nuts crack, typical disease world.

The potential long term complications type vaccine extremely rare. One type influenza vaccine weakly linked type facial nerve problem, one type H1N1 vaccine linked sleep disorders, long term issues heard of. occurred 1 case per millions vaccinations, like longer Phase III would captured anyways (because enrolled 30000 volunteers) Live vaccine much risky, would hesitant get rushed live vaccine, Covid dangerous one trying make live vaccine it, especially looks like safe options going work. little morbid logistical challenge get people could perhaps make mask memory allows wearer write name every person know lost may change perspectives. Walking around outside seeing someone mask five names written might oh shit moment still denial. No, ranting, speaking something valid. unware it, something evil structure reality, evil structure greater reality, case mass consciousness. viewpoint viewpoint mass making assumptions based upon worldview correct possible possible. PSYCHOTIC so. alignment ACTUAL mass consciousness creation. seek help correct this, recognize it.

Sir/ma‚Äôam, please stop ranting get psychiatric help immediately. Yeah pro-virus anti-shutdown anti-mask protests definitely help. do? gotta let gun toting, unread rednecks stupid, senseless ideas march right. Ahh yes pure facts. Fuck Fauci. entire situation pisses degree. I've family members lot jobs first time life. seen certain older relatives year. I'll never forget never stop working expose bullshit. wishes circus. point completely made up. science clear - children spread virus much less non-children. 

Which whole problem propaganda. created narrative support anti-science agenda. 

And it‚Äôs pointed you, double ‚ÄúOh, thing using support point actually true, trust me, anti-science stance still correct.‚Äù mean, cant ban protests, court case would easily within day. add balance argument political party would done better pants. Oh know, one chance fuck up. literally *nothing.* largest cities areas Georgia plans get shit control.

And homicidal malice put kibosh that. 

Fuck forever ever. hope end this, ends prison rest shitty life. Wow, Trump right, tired winning much. That's get ghosts haunted ice skating drinks. OSHA real. real every factory/warehouse ive ever worked would shut saftey violations Damn myth got video proof capitalism death cult making shit go along. arn't heavy restrictions, either Sweden UK. places shops pubs open, swiming pools cinemas. 

In places people need go outside home work gone back work. fewer restrictions Brits Swedes New Yorkers Californians.

What changed work home so, hygiene public places improved. changes permanent - long continue, herd immunity. seem arguing changes permanent - give evidence it. wish way express disbelief could possibly even consider everything BACKWARDS.

We literally going fucking die. Brave too? Good question. Yeah, Mexico actually handling crisis worse US. guess that's happens entire government owned operated drug cartels. That's really sad naive. brand new virus know half do. We'll finding years. already know impact brain infect heart muscle. kid ""gets it"" quickly mean absolutely impacted. want developing brain infected virus? means cognitive issues rest life? heart? develop heart disease 20 infected 3? blood clots? simply know going long-term. Death negative outcome. people **JUST find it**? Stuff going **looong time**. One time life thought time protest. century highly contagious deadly pandemic. since found deadly originally thought. 

Now economy ruins still virus. lot people going home less **a lot people going die**. media politicized Virus. use cell phone data fine/imprison A-holes protesting lock manslaughter, reckless endangerment minimum white. Totally agree. Never embarrassed American. Thankfully live Massachusetts greatly improved *most* people common sense respect wear mask. Yeah wide reporting store shelves flour pasta. pushing dumb Americans angle. impossible know whats long lasting wide spread started March. July.

Yeah maybe sort fucking realization infecting tens millions people novel virus who's effect human body clear yet horrible shitty idea. I‚Äôd :) ""herd immunity"" relies never ending quarantine restrictions herd immunity.

Herd immunity applies unmitigated scenario. Yeah totally. guess go grocery store either since staters like stop too. argument there. Honestly cares football right now? bigger issues worry about. hand lockdown measures, social distancing masks also reduce death caused reasons: People staying home less likely involved accidents. everything limits spread COVID-19 infections also limits spread several infections. We‚Äôll probably never know true numbers. Right. guy votes oh boy. really need believe karma right now. It‚Äôs almost scientists use best available data given time guide decision-making? USA! USA! USA! USA! always easier blame vulnerable group people it.  clarify, $60Bn long term liabilities 2019 operating costs another $60Bn (likely less dramatically 2020) $70Bn fore Fox, that's say $150Bn liabilities limited income parks, ESPN, exploiting Fox catalogue, Disney+ launch, making content, etc. Since start lockdown added extra $20Bn borrowing credit lines, executives pay slashes, staff laid - they're nice position. Sorry say people dont care anymore. roommate 32 stopped paying attention everything re-opened. Gyms back business didnt care anymore, thats matters him. admits doesnt pay attention doesnt wear mask. I‚Äôd beg differ one. see 3/4 millennials wearing masks required, 1/3 boomers. mention fact it‚Äôs usually boomers don‚Äôt properly cover face using mask. I‚Äôve seen actually lift mask speak. could dense!? dunno, I've felt surrounded idiots nearly every job I've had. last months particularly illuminating every prediction made came true, coworkers thought would big deal forced admit fault. LIKE RAAAIIINNNNNNN WEDDIIIING DAY Well, live they're state. Yea put employers business. fix problems.


People need emergency fund blow money.

Back bought house supporting girlfriend back 08 45k still saved money. cut expenses made sure extend.

Both corporations citizens allowed massively extend government bails out.


It creates terrible behavior everyone. Care explain? question keep coming becomes answer ... schools open. Damn feels good gangster Seems like people would think ""Whoa, smart people cancelled. Maybe they're something."" 70 studies efficacy masks.  article goes that, percentage positive cases declined pretty steeply (from 20% around 9%) No, ranting, speaking something valid. unware it, something evil structure reality, evil structure greater reality, case mass consciousness. viewpoint viewpoint mass consciousness. 

You making assumptions based upon worldview correct possible possible. PSYCHOTIC so. alignment ACTUAL mass consciousness creation. seek help correct this, recognize it. I‚Äôm hoping you‚Äôre math teacher. I‚Äôm thinking confirmation bias likely case. I'm staying local area. Yep. Sadly way realize it‚Äôs serious family nearly die. That‚Äôs something wouldn‚Äôt wish anyone. Remember, america authoritarian country No, home worth 300k. Suburban neighborhood, 0.2 acre lot. 

This normal Jersey. right ugly. canceled Lunar New Year holiday! like saying giant meteor inbound. Everyone Korea went ""Oh, fuuu..."" Within week one going anything essentials. Post like simply prove vast majority people idea world works food, clothes energy comes from. Let fill blanks you. Food medicine clothes energy produced ""economic activity"". handing people fake, electronic money.

If people engaged productive economic activity, food, medicine, clothes, energy, etc. 

If could shut economy ad send people money nothing, would ages. Damn. rough then. Good luck. I'd agree, except income plays role risk. person afford self isolate significant amount time, risk lesser, matter risk factors otherwise are. definitely seeing huge factor who's getting sick. That's think jobs one major factors deciding gets when. Herd immunity means virus unlikely propagate naturally population. 20% immunity herd immunity virus R0 3. Pretty effective total fraud. mean, locked everything completely right now, absolutely essential people working, provided solid social safety net, would massively effective, unless Congress (or least states) made huge changes handle things like unemployment, would hurt people much getting virus. get sick go massive debt medical care, stay home, work, end homeless starving kids. Oh yes. familiar AZ, see that. üò£ Eventually genetic material would wiped away process elimination weak, case minded. problem many would take along them. feelings daddy Trump lies what, exactly? contagious. mostly spreading indoor gatherings people exposed 15+ minutes.

Passing someone store wearing masks going get infected. Teachers unions weakened much anything. strikes illegal us great majority states. guys see masks sold Amazon, Walmart retailers, file complaint. Amazon example link product page that. Tell rest us found item same.
Shut fuck Sweden, like Japan, follows government guidelines masks + social distancing also already introverted culture. also tend care fellow citizens instead themselves. many live single family households helps reduce second branch spread. Corona also spreads super spreaders culture introverted lot less them. Think like Sex City type people basically go every night constantly talking/singing/yelling bars/events.  


So works Sweden/Japan work cultures like Italy extroverted greet people close contact. US/UK trust governments, care family, also physical greetings. NJ considered normal, reason. awful. don‚Äôt think anyone believes 30% positive means 30% prevalence. issue positive rate controlling spread. Ideally track cases test contacts case track test contacts. positive rate above, would say 10%, getting enough people probably missing positive cases going spread disease without control. I‚Äôve heard opinions 5%. testing 10% likely lots community spread probably shelter place order. low positive rates confidence opening mixing cases caught tracking isn‚Äôt much community spread. 30% 60% testing diagnostic doctors know you‚Äôre sick. doesn‚Äôt much control spread. rate, GA FL going even worse within couple weeks. Forgot mention live parents still. didnt think said going.. could spread parents. ones planned dont think they'll stay home... makes sense. People getting sick virus discriminate. hits know blame. media? agree. dangerous oneself ones around you. Driving? Heavy machinery? Taking care others? Dizziness joke going make tasks either hard impossible. willing examine ideas. Without ability wrong enlightenment. 

I hope get point forced pay attention actually affecting them. wear masks public transport shops, quite major restriction.

Furthermore, number people England coronavirus estimated around 7% May.

In July, number people Scotland coronavirus estimated less 5%. said fine. Implying thousands people 60 dead fine. Yes, allow clarify correct myself. 

By saying uneconomical, meant, positively economically viable. ain't making money gut close it.

I know many residents unemployed due fault own, room empty cheaper landlord non-paying resident. used started out. standard Olson style facemask filter pockets see everywhere.

Then found mask design YouTube video respirator fit tested different homemade masks. masks failed, design passed. designed University Florida's College Medicine Anesthesiology Department (they used Halyard 600) pass respirator fit test. started making instead fabric combo recommended University Chicago (one layer 600 thread count 100% cotton two layers polyester-spandex chiffon).

This new design filter pocket. Thanks anyway offer.

How sanitizing Halyard 600? According UF webpage, can't wash it. masks making going autoclaved --- option people home unless got pressure cooker. heating oven? Good. need this. Enough bullshit. Wear mask get fucked up. good realize thread titled, responding comment, made mention loans. jump straight calling complete strangers racist. 

If try engage people, might change minds. scream ""racist!"" everyone perceive different you. America number one motherfuckers! ran want go more. use multiple masks day. Lol see let's test them. Sneaky white people. Bangladesh afford that? seems government cannot even help people. definitely decrease cases USA.

The real question wealthy people get priority access? say no, know real answer. remember press conference estimated 100,000 - 200,000 dead end summer. People flipped shit. next day revised estimate 60,000 dead people breathed sigh relief.

It reminded psychology price ~~200,000~~ 60,000 dead!

Now we're 150,000 dead significant portion country does. not. care. Thanks Captain Obvious CDC already tweet days ago. Man, case Cincinnati. could find bread, pasta, flour, yeast back March April. friends rural KY talked similar shortages there.

Even difficult find yeast flour starting reliably stocked. shown effect demographics seems utilitarian Trump allowing thousands die needlessly. saying nefarious reason behind this, know someone gets tested twice week want wear mask. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. people unnecessarily soaking resources.

They literally communication labs med school (and actually vet school now). start learning talk effectively patients without even practicing medicine. make patients feel heard like you‚Äôre process. learn practice medicine, incorporate communication. actors play patients practice them. It‚Äôs really intimidating first time it, especially haven‚Äôt taught communicate volatile situations. Maybe kind thing less important aspects people research, someone high position ends public eye, especially like Dr. Fauci, it‚Äôs extremely important effective communicator.

Tell grandma happy birthday, love you, want risk killing stay fuck home. America #1 ü•á highest affected group line work exposure this.

Ok, let's unpack little bit, kind understand coming from. assertion highly impacted racial group we'll take face value (I believe true based I've read, can't say sure case read enough it, let's go ahead assume case argument). determine appropriate course response, need understand impact. far tell, 4 options.

1) Genetics - possible virus dangerous Black Latino people something genes. case, absolutely 100% looking giving priority access since would good prevent adverse outcomes.

2) Comorbidity - also possible different populations different levels comorbidities them, would end looking like racial disparity actually health based one. case no, Black Latino people get priority access, maybe look giving priority access obese people diabetes, would give access Black Latino people, expense race comorbidities. 

3) Cultural - possibility cultural differences driving different infection rates. Different groups different traditions, traditions make groups less susceptible diseases (for example groups eat pork much less likely fall ill infected pork). difficult one, could argue either way. I'd suggest cultural differences, they're driven choice (and past choices, choices make going forward case) would give preferential vaccines reason.

4) Socio-economic - also possible state differences driven socio-economic differences. Black Latino people work front line jobs, they're exposed, therefor see group suffer larger impact. case, again, NO, give ""Black Latino"" people priority access vaccine. Again, give priority access front line workers. again, Black people Latino people might benefit greatly distribution method, based race, would based actual differentiating factor. opposing science.

What scientific solution problem- reduce death?

A. Lockdown 2 years, police/military enforced. (Saves 0.5% lives, assumes suicides home abuses go up)

B. Lockdown 2 months, open, lockdown another 2 months, open. (Saves 0% people)

C. lockdown, (Save 0% people)

So 'A' seems answer, know many people going kill develop alcoholism. But... A. B.

Now pick scientific solution, B C. though, many pro athletes Florida, many tests per day put aside them?

Considering NBA, MLS, WNBA running entire leagues Orlando that's pretty large list that's including coaches team support personnel Also dept handles patient privacy issues fines hospital violating patient privacy. Like, enforcement arm lol end comment... seems inappropriate. government trustworthy.  fact think man doesn‚Äôt deserve respect hes given think name brother important says lot you.  car broke nice middle aged couple offered ride next exit, literally seatbelts removed car! that? article said player ""tests positive"" miss 3 games like next month. R already 1, going continue gathering pace. might lizard person. Ping changes, ""Countries reopened schools passing peak epidemic show immediate spike new cases far."" Confused post. ""Chinese journalist"" mean journalist china someone Chinese decent? nothing he's done far, certainly best nothing he's responsible for. 

I think clear mask mandates needed get control, remove option contrarians trotting 'legitimate reasons' wear mask smirk face. guy said April know asymptomatic people could still transmit virus. Don‚Äôt blame morons. one moron particular refusing shut country properly 2-3 weeks kick good. problem knowledge time clear vulnerable children were. said argument, real reason probably inconvenient people keep children home. normal coming back really starting feel like officials judges actively trying kill people. article talking specifically one protest held one city (Melbourne, Australia), vast majority protesters wore masks instances infection already low. 

You cannot extrapolate say EVERY protest around world same.

ALSO saying protest 100% cause spread virus, evidence did. 

Don't read article actually saying. asked principal sick leave, recently planning department (we social distance) Tuesday. said work home, won‚Äôt count us. seriously ill hospital can‚Äôt teach remotely, will. shit not. So, get seriously ill working many kids people ICU (actually area room anyone, I‚Äôd probably left die). principal said sub would cover got sick, funny since subs best times nearly impossible am. So, department would probably expected cover kids, too, split them. Nice! 

Then got discussing administrator district gravely ill. Apparently, brilliant district administrators meet several people got COVID. district smaller, news never really leaked saw heard. Good Lord! can‚Äôt twenty adults meet safely, yet let‚Äôs pretend everything normal. terrifies proxy - imagine child time, say wether want go not, future health depends even normal times questionable hygiene skills kids. goes parents choice send children school. fucked situation in. Glad guys pond option home school, probably sufficient need most. Reply top comment says fudging data. Zoomers boomers kind ride wave, millennials black sheep. Shit. Stay safe. Imo say took corona-virus part seriously.My uncle got infected covid(fever,weight loss,difficulty breathing) forced home-quarantine hospital beds available(Karnataka),although also attributed fact India always piss- poor healthcare infrastructure.

My uncle ok now,but still worried especially things seem going Karnataka. heroes? get idolization? else look pandemic? I'll take Fauci mistakes Trump deliberate sabotage. Exactly. governor president fucking morons, mean one well. know Grace 15-year-old white girl would sitting juvenile detention right now,"" mother, Sheri Crawley, told local TV news station WDIV

Oh. black? Good lord. black *child*, say? Thrown prison handing homework. 

Well, surprise... doubt they‚Äôre getting rid stuff willy-nilly. American exceptionalism looks like, country produced curve like that. said need parents stay home kids year.

For clarification, look 68% figure 40-49 age group, number represents % people wearing masks *within* age group. they're highest contributors non-mask wearers. 68% smaller population (=12.9 million) vs. 26% higher population (=15.5 million). Trump human trash never elected. lying public large number blunders Fauci made tad much.

Fauci recommending healthy people go cruises company shutting entire office. Looks like HR team got right Yeah, doesnt deliver. Every time said he's increased testing, misses date cooks figures. test counted twice figures nose throat eyes that's 2 tests. also also promised nhs lots money before, untill look details see money already going nhs before, etc...

He's crook, believe word says go wrong. much like trump promise world deliver nothing. Remember back someone would say ""I think may flu symptoms"" everyone nearby would back away say ""Stay away me!"" ? That‚Äôs exactly want system working intended. actual credible reports Russia attacking elections putting bounties troops

Just Intelligence Agency says it, mean credible. groups also said Iraq WMD 2003. say serves agenda. 

Americans voted Trump solid majority dumb bricks, Russians made them. Troops dying Afghanistan Russian bounties ""They hate freedoms"" welcome Afghans always invaders. Russia need pay them. Afghans plenty able kill Americans reasons. 

Democrats want focus Russia Putin, Republicans want focus China Xi Jingping. advice would sort problems deal villains looking overseas bad guys deal with. Fauci icy took additional three weeks restrictions. ,100k per day soon kids people, never punished disciplined growing up, told jobs ‚Äòbeneath‚Äô them, don‚Äôt understand Black Friday deals aren‚Äôt available week later ZONDRA Haters gonna hate. either support Trump want prove Fauci much fuck up, isn't, find reason complain. Reschedule 16 days out. want skiing open we're part üòâ America land EMPEROR Sorry, inadvertently deleted Trump administration actually changed course today - since decision controversial - directed CDC put COVID-related hospital data back website.  Guess don‚Äôt understand science. yes? pushing government regulation. USA! USA! USA! We're world record holders, suck rest world! state certainly undercounting deaths. many excess ""pneumonia"" deaths time frame? People didn‚Äôt realize bad grifter sociopath fake business man would say anything could Considering poorly paid teachers r likely best quit tho sadly good options us now. Loved lady heads teachers union called trump vile DeVos creature tho. Hoping n people sense say NO. know it‚Äôs hard balancing things one day parent sending kid school basically allowing mass abuse/sacrifice situation. Nice name instance protecting employer lawsuits complaints state officials compliant... DeSantis something Trump suggests it. Dude absolutely fucking spineless That's frustrates much. lot north eastern united states gave normal life, job, etc. last 5 months get things control. sacrifice undone entitled (wo)manbabies south got way, know would say Probably like klan meeting something Reddits wet dream, getting paid sedentary lifestyle. Shit like makes regret voting Bernie primary. Nobody work we'll give money can't spend anywhere. economy made inflation recessions. far left. mean trackers never got data CDC anyways. long states stop reporting numbers still ok. it‚Äôs possible Donald Trump shit bed response. refused leader. refused listen experts. He‚Äôs made sure buddies got paid American public teeters brink financial ruin. bungled acquisition PPE. held little rally cases spiking. refused wear mask. demanding kids get sent back school plan it.

He‚Äôs ‚Äúscapegoated‚Äù mess. Narrator ""they didnt.""  Probably one last days real numbers. Yes mink human transmission Netherlands, look up. mink industry needs end sadly gone deep far long seems way. want see step forward end industry. banned Netherlands.  don‚Äôt need cover anything base eat crap ask foe seconds 1 day almost many confirmed cases China (total) since whole thing started?  states reporting todays numbers. money everyone ditching in-person model. There‚Äôs way anyone going feel good going ahead couple weeks, much less month. ImPoRtEd that's Florida cases countries world. Billionaires directly benefited corruption government likely wouldn‚Äôt wealthy without corruption. Think reparations paying fair share first place. first wave never stopped tho said speaking lawyer options I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs highly likely. get ride there? I‚Äôll give u $$$ Publix announce also proportion non-susceptible individuals required herd immunity get R &lt; 1 depends entirely R0, varies strongly based population density, cultural tendencies, etc.

The idea ""68% must antibodies herd immunity kick in"" ridiculous. sparsely populated rural town Sweden people tend keep may need 20% population form immunity virus burn out, somewhere like NYC may need 70%. actual proportion currently unknown there's lot evidence antibodies required‚Äîmany people cells coronaviruses cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 seem reduced susceptibility begin with.

Also virus tends high degree variability many secondary infections infected individual cause. people infect 1 even 0 people, small minority may infect 10+ people, likely specific kinds events conditions ideal transmission. Generally crowded indoor spaces well ventilated people singing, speaking, breathing heavily, coughing, etc. Night clubs, public transit, busy commercial gyms / group exercise classes, church services, etc. happen small towns. think would happened bad pandemic happened Obama‚Äôs tenure, would let CDC Fauci take center stage followed advice. Please don‚Äôt retire virus over. Please don‚Äôt get fired. Sorry getting rid trump make everything get better. There‚Äôs still time Election Day January he‚Äôll even damage. lot things need repaired fixing problem got trunk elected first place.  Lol lazy type words ""landlord"" ""reddit"" Google. PLEASE NEVER. he‚Äôs psychopath don‚Äôt matter him. matters him. Absolutely sick winning game. think people won‚Äôt die broken economies? virus scary angry, hungry people scarier.

Especially since it‚Äôs already proven countries masking social distancing removes need shut economy. Maybe afford house market crashes theres enough people fill houses. 

This worlds fucked up.   Best buy keeping curbside pickup too, though open store (which makes sense repairs such). come backlogs cases reported today estimated anywhere 0.2% 1% CDC's best guess 0.65 now. likely fall back testing increases mean tell me. I'm chemist. think would better less random shit everything general public weird notion somehow nature produces it, chemical.

What's even ridiculous, mind, that, bet you, antivaxxers would gladly take completely unfounded snake oil cure Joe Shmoe without sort background internal medicine.  Hmm see Johns Hopkins mentioned looks like good resource. I'll dig see compares I've using site pretty Make numbers fake Neither bullshit. Moderna pump dump money making machine. vaccine works? works. Russians care. 

Oxford, profitable Russians. literally happened NYC y‚Äôall acting surprised happening now. ignorance humiliating son wasn‚Äôt kid. Old enough go drinking, it‚Äôs implied.  article doesn‚Äôt list name refers young man. evening early June, young man went wishes, gathered friends removed mask eating drinking. them, I've known plenty intelligent reasonable people, enough voice influence make much difference, attempting become increasingly daunting What's gonna happen january? Awww...

Oh wait there's actual problems concerned about. Hmm maybe actually valued useful skills ability throw stupid ball situation country. really close down. states *very* marginal close outside New York/New England area--and even weeks most. What? How? Desantis still going schools opening &amp; whole ‚ÄúEverything ok, seeing cases bc testing.‚Äù believe new codes. get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's bit extrapolating believe every death falsely coded COVID spins head. Win win win

Can't stop winning bro! loud enough feels like majority. said. Masks already proven social distancing adequately slow virus without shut down.

So slow virus keep economy going  happening NYC. Time Square closed 3 months y‚Äôall think it‚Äôs joke? said things you‚Äôre saying now. ‚ÄúWe never seen anything like this‚Äù warned you. closed heart city months y‚Äôall wanna go beach? Y‚Äôall asking catch virus beg healthy doctors nurses come treat risk lives dumb stupid people barley contribute society tryna save like what? Stay ass home wear damn mask go outside like fuck. isn‚Äôt Texas Karen.  think owners care players getting smashing lose opportunity make millions dollars life? There‚Äôs big difference sending kid daycare class 10 students three classes sending elementary school 300 kids 10 classes aides rotate them. would feel absolutely incredible see crush Trump election. buddy process going pro March unemployed n fretting state ever come thru.. kind legal action taken? types ""legal action"" would leave public record reporters would jump on. Maybe consider evaluating likely ""what heard"" true repeating it? Oh re-read couple times. Yes, does.  speak state numbers clear. Age  20-30 rapidly become age group cases. Recent outbreaks traced gatherings people age groups well (a fraternity party. bachelor party exercise group). Maybe it‚Äôs different elsewhere, it‚Äôs case younger people driving sudden rise numbers. isn‚Äôt based see neighborhood numbers information released health department. United States masters domestic propaganda. shit failed state years They‚Äôre going get customers this. We‚Äôre going feel safer knowing store enforcing needed health issue. I'm happy hope goes well. know challenging I'm thankful safer. Good luck everything hope great school year! plan reopen schools universities? Wow. reporting would linked yesterday instead today 

Worldometer tries standardize day, still giving days numbers reported. usually find accurate helpful check yesterdays numbers first thing morning true far age increase risk according statistical inference Yeah, I'm Massachusetts resident myself. went similar measures. scares bit colleges schools open back Fall. Even limited capacity, still means hundreds thousands students state coming back, including states like Florida, Texas, etc. I'm also college student school (in Boston area) currently planning ""hybrid"" model (mix in-class online, choose mostly flexible), decent percentage people still choose come live campus wish. think shocking misunderstanding many people America substantial retirement accounts. Texan Oklahoma, hope pulls Gov Stitt soon. true, you‚Äôre dem bubble. coworker told ‚Äúall in‚Äù- happens life God‚Äôs plan. said she‚Äôll follow rules wear mask that- wants us go back ‚Äúall in‚Äù. feels way, others. could imagine guilt I'd live son killed parent rebellious. Fuck economics, people dying. know countries willingly shut months even though virus faked hurt Trump's campaign? Yeah, self-immolating economy months took get back firing cylinders now. half assed shut down, half people wearing masks school boards discussing person classes telecom meetings they're smart enough risk lives, kids'. I'm embarrassed American. knew us dumb never imagined many us fatally stupid. wore masks stopped going work month, economy would marvelously six months. Instead we're printing years worth monetary supply month giving banker-class people buy propaganda trick people going back work. nation 330 million people printed 6 trillion dollars virus. comes 18 million per citizen, see $1200.  hear that. I'm actually incredibly relieved. Thank you! Simon mall (northern NJ) requires masks recent case pop store reported sanitized staff quarantine might clear. BMI 30 (and putting lots muscle) would plenty obese. try reading Radical Gay Antifa Islamists  like football, compared everything else going right now, cares? huge deal season without college football. grocery store (Winn Dixie) ""soft-enforcing"" state finally mandated masks. mean put sign saying customers required wear mask saying anything anybody comes without one.

I'm glad see majority people complying order, definitely masks last week. really wish managers would enforce it. Person sounds like got severe mental illness. Imagine thinking would easier enforce lockdown masks. types people thinking three months ahead, matter plainly lay front them. That's problem. like drinking game. Take swig Corona, pass right. 

Oh wait, Texas right going passed drunk time get turn...

...uh... Sorry. job us coming 1-2 days week (granted we're NJ cases down) think every time go in. Especially lax people wearing masks desks offices. Kroger live... town either (very small) HEB Walmart. Closer towns Aldi, drive us stick Walmart mostly. love HEB would rather support go there, small town husband live in, Walmart better selection :( miss HEB Plus worry, women children *cough* wealthy lifeboats *cough* yachts Bring Karen's Ken's worried liberties concerned everyone else's.  See tomorrow folks 80K  weird thing Trump screwing people voted too, yet many stupid see imagine government lifted fucking finger slightest reduce infection rate lower fatality rate could actually mean anything believe science. file complaint Kaiser due workers coughing hands wearing masks handling prescriptions. 

The next week relieved see got board social distancing, masks, wiping counters. Well, unless worker 120 years old older, no, would likely seen anything like this. Still cheaper take Uber EMS kayaking considered safe activity? would obviously best stay away paddlers. idea 6 figures lot money something 70s. much money today's dollars especially places. unions!

Im really trying hard stay positive. one puts baby corner. trying say numbers inflated? Cleary...

*gestures vaguely everything*

I think effective right word, even though fault effective. Effectiveness based results. Let's that...in 14 days. think essential future stimulus unemployment entitlements must clause denying benefits defy mask mandates public safety orders. logic making political astounds me. could hero, getting way. Instead stuck cluster-f**ck next six months. word spelled ""ingrained"" novel context means never seen humans essentially. coronavirus seen coronaviruses humans before, however seen particular virus infect sicken humans. means lot know virus simply year study it.  

I doctor scientist whole lot subtleties considerations confident bringing basics. lol. Im watching australia (we got issues currently) mix horror, disbelief comedy crazy stuff done / said. truely don‚Äôt understand large portions population issues basic measures....... to.

Trump say, ""Those refigamatered trucks hamberders cafeteria horse- house- HOSHPITAL!"" supporters believe it.

Half country fucking brainwashed. Amen Pretty sad corporate America control virus federal
Goverment Correct. It‚Äôs people unemployed still employed reduced hours/pay. different Canada requirements. consider lucky. I'm attending first year boarding school fall. nutshell, they're bring us hold us. Testing prior arrival required. Social distancing masks required certain, times, things calm down.

Hopefully, pray god lock down. whose money? oh yeah. forgot 5,500 cases Bexar happened happen.

The report said influenced viewed election, directly manipulated. r/coronavirus get based? goes well Oxford vaccine, currently contracts place produce 2 billion year. first hundred million expected year, think USA gets 100. 1/3 population inoculated would drastically reduce transmission. Perfect time ban masks Georgia seems! still here? Tony Robbins book promote somewhere? already deleted insensitive, racist, ignorant comments, already feel ashamed enough delete them. think Tony Robbins would proud behaviors. What‚Äôs ideology?

And there‚Äôs mountain evidence says she‚Äôs saying isn‚Äôt possible. Let's get small business stimulus too. small businesses fail, big businesses remain fill void. values do? News me. haven‚Äôt basically ever. lot misinformation time.

America still battling first horribly losing. Sunglasses face mask use sun.

Prove wrong. umm don‚Äôt follow every American getting that. wish. Shocker. Alarm ringing awhile. Falls deaf ears. Canadian here. actually shiiit wear mask eating, drinking, worshipping, yada yada yada. close shit down. see light end tunnel...you'll dead cuz corona. Naw, political dissidents, journalists, whistleblowers, protestors, inmates test too. It‚Äôs extremely likely it‚Äôs Uigurs. Absolutely 100% would have. president stood said every single American doesn‚Äôt wear mask football year guarantee everyone would still one on. want president that‚Äôs going make Russia pay every last fucking thing they‚Äôve done world last 100 years. That‚Äôs busy local news pages saying cases 90 percent expounding masks kill CO2 flu WAY worse, thought trolls realized went high school two them. Like yeah, I‚Äôm going trust holler scholar schooling epidemiology. could give advice, would worry less republican vs democrat talking points sides. reason lot republican states trouble shut soon wore good will. honestly say live virus issue. shut great city state New York crippled. think New York would shut Orlando Atlanta hit hard first? Hard know, thoughts... unless vaccine makes way soon, places like live next... virulent virus seems be, matter time gets location point plan hunkering down... plan place... shut everything everywhere unfortunately won‚Äôt work. 
I‚Äôm mandatory masks etc... 

I also personally think hippa laws revoked TEMPORARILY Covid cases... it‚Äôs like freaking mystery novel... place shuts can‚Äôt tell tested positive... god almighty tell us know contact person get tested etc... nooo lets let people interact whole world spreading around üò§ I‚Äôm ready conversations around teachers, friends, parents friends passed away COVID them. Even much protecting family, worry may deal level survivors guilt. district doubled starting person August 3rd. don‚Äôt understand still move forward given current situation Georgia. ""It discrimination everybody OK enabling rewarding behavior,‚Äù told KGTV ""I get shortness breath, dizziness messes heartbeat,"" told local news station. ""And asthma well, get mask-acne. there‚Äôs several things going **but doesn‚Äôt even work.**‚Äù

I think safely ignore everything said ""but.""

*But*, yes do. Starbucks right refuse service. entitled anything except disregarding public private mandates within confines home. must new talking point headquarters No. I‚Äôm saying flew US Japan already told mask up. 

Everyone wearing masks March remember mask shortage referred to. Basically seeing China welding doors shut full Hazmat suits people wearing masks general based cues worldwide

It official mask orders people knew back then. still aren‚Äôt official mask orders states too. one wears masks doesn‚Äôt really social distance much live canada still many less cases, how? It‚Äôs like cult. happens watch propaganda channel every day hours time, Fox MSNBC. one wears masks doesn‚Äôt really social distance much live canada still many less cases, how? problem buddy. I‚Äôm voting I'm hard time finding info... know vaccine current state reconstituted? imagine probably something determined developing supply chain, I'm sure. tot little 2 years old. Earlier year (like January) discussed put daycare come fall classes + dad's work, decided go back school. classes online mine online semester. staying home. 

Personally, even school age, I'm comfortable unknowns point. I'm responsible right entirely. faced sort long term consequences put risk able live myself. like little known, dad count high risk anyway. Plus preemie who's done really well. Nothing worth risk. Yeah, too, many school districts, states, especially federal government done little help cases. Where's fucking funding question? work district many 1:1 schools, including mine, better prepared most, I'm prepping too. where's support need? beyond late this. US basically screwed. I. Have. No. Idea. Really. may sound like broken record think fucked. 

The time gain control pandemic April. still solid third country denying pandemic would Wuhan style enforced lockdown 1) impossible practical stand point US. It‚Äôs impossible. 2) would want current federal government enforcing lockdown like that. Like Jesus Christ clusterfuck would be.

I know can‚Äôt keep printing money would think government could allocate better. mean fuck, passed 200 billion military bill poured billions corporations last stimulus. money floating around. 

But yeah, point don‚Äôt see get pandemic control. I'm Ontario. 111 new cases today. rate positive overall might going down, expect hotspots cool off, enough states testing population get 10,000+ positives Look fatality rate case number. US fatality rate much lower countries, especially developed countries. us torture. talking mom(76) day. generation grew watching evening news somewhat reliable. believe anything see news, facebook, platforms, without ever checking see sharing plausible not. media said true, must be. Oh ok, thanks ""Treatment"" ""Vaccines"" different. Either way, progress progress hope saves lives. Italy NY shut WAY hitting ICU capacity. states still dicking around, trying bully virus. You‚Äôre spewing bullshit. 

Back early April, Fauci‚Äôs message was: Masks don‚Äôt offer great deal protection infected effective preventing sick people spreading virus, currently lack supply masks, please save medical professionals need more.

As supply chain issues got sorted danger shortages waned, started recommended everyone wear one, reason above, prevents spread sick person. Yet won‚Äôt even give USPS employees hazard pay. Fellow carrier here. May Rest Peace. Breaks heart know chances high won‚Äôt be/isn‚Äôt casualty virus. refuse give us kind hazard pay anything like that. Sad. 100% correct. 

You got [two [three half dime, [twenty certain gold coins, unofficially, half dollar dollar coin. Ahhh remember good old days teachers worry school shootings...pepperidge farms remembers!!!! Actually quite literally could change heart. 55% Covid patients showing ""abnormal changes"" involving heart. 6 weeks many kids needing masks. Sadly. thinking Chernobyl. alarm sounding? one that's since January 21st? could learned lesson easy way. that‚Äôs American. We‚Äôre going learn hard way millions dead, suffering starving. people stay homes. stupid spoiled shit whined feel like pathetic joke. actually read karens *Welcome Coca Cola-AT&amp;T-Daimler Chrysler Election 2020*  Fake News...WH Edition...cooked books straight executive suite...just time Goya commercial right campaign speech...  recommending get tested visiting mom? would like say view US response pandemic sad pathetic. live country 100x less infection rate. that? smart enough vote American rat Canadian election. 

Do favor get country control thinking come visit mine. People getting **angry** contempt others. Trying vacation completely disrespecting progress laws made protect ourselves. Dangerous ground.

I would want american decides wave flag front someone family die this. joke.

I hope pull neighbors. Take care stay backyard til eh? anyone know we, society, 1.6 million people died diarrhea 2017? seems like something prevent. called inflation. understand? point unnecessary tests testing dead people. too. hope rid gop government helps people, funds schools, believes science , etc. sad seems like silly daydream . party that‚Äôs killing American dream considered patriotic ? Ya movies filmed pre covid. problem filming shut since March anything wasn‚Äôt completed majorly delayed release still need wait even able film told people wear masks first place.

This help fight shortages lower number medical rpofessionals dying would make things worse. told everyone needed time shortage panic would worse, hospitals would much worse time.

Also know much it. Initially cleaning hands main focus masks.  Thank much this. really need right now. ""You're going sick winning "" care. Built money book make Damn. sugar daddy Instagram DM's sign it? Better sorry safe! we‚Äôre getting faster deadlier, three four months delayed. really hope there‚Äôs way vaccine, it‚Äôs looking bleaker bleaker. time period November-January Trump loses gonna nail biter. doesn‚Äôt lose well could see wanting damage like psycho ex boyfriend. ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è look total all-cause mortality Sweden per flu season instead calendar years (You start week 40 previous year), Sweden currently - covid-19 deaths included - still trending historical 20-year average.

So people alive Sweden, today, July 16th, historical average would predict, despite disastrous zombie apocalypse virus ravaging barbaric Swedes sacrificed elderly folks arrogance.

Disaster ass. Yeah Europe got public transport like trains shit. üòé Information face coverings early could saved thousands 10 thousands lives. extremely ineffective. Regular people wanted n95s got anyway, nobody wearing homemade masks early That‚Äôs right Dr. Fauci. Fight bastards. GOAT. He's planning comfortable retirement. would cause inflation poverty level $50k/yr. Genius. Donate time and/or money towards getting corrupt enablers office. It‚Äôs way out. never open schools again? .......... real? wrong Georgia????? name's Fauci, Anthony Fauci! Licensed heal! üòé Oh...OOOHHhh Seriously, you‚Äôre going ‚Äúhate‚Äù entire generation? Talk judgmental. can‚Äôt generalize entire generation. It‚Äôs illogical narrow-minded. Get yourself. shit doctor lacks basic understanding viral spread. stupid, half people arguing wear one can't coherently tell why. ones can, fail logic. literally good reason comply. (*if triggered im talking you) want to, enjoy proving to. Thank you. I'm glad. accurate now. we're broken beaters get run over... Well government AINT gonna pay unemployment better figure fuck situation, don‚Äôt choice. Yeah that's like actual euphemism. due respect thing, due modesty? something earn like respect say parent 3, two special needs severely impacted able back school... complete monster can't see point view teachers staff. 

They WANT back classrooms. WANT back kids. think want risk lives money? joke. care. care much. literally exploiting entire subset people caring. Think warped is. teachers make jack shit financially still considering going back, care. Despite fact many terrified making sure they've finished wills. even get place.... ""Age contagion""? diseases exist before. downvoted hundreds sources developed therapies formerly fatal diseases polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis polyangiitis, lymphomatoid 2003, Institute Scientific Information stated 1983 2002, ""Fauci 13th most-cited scientist among 2.5 3 million authors disciplines throughout world published articles scientific journals"" We've seen issue shutting down. starting back up. What's plan that? Definitely. us, parents love trump. Bitching masks real. like always say ""The Left gonna eat alive!"" Right going face first hurricane sneezing like wearing little cloth. 

 may eating themselves, they're letting natural selection  mean Trump? someone else put him? get people going ""SEE!!!! Theyre deleting dont want know!!! Wake sheeple hoax!!!!!! would make worse opinion originally said wouldn‚Äôt this, I‚Äôm glad decided to. Though I‚Äôve seen people wearing masks. Looks like America is...killing it.

*CSI Miami intro plays* testing fucking killing people now! Quick, stop testing people die! education, widespread, focused counts think better, get paycheck. Georgian here.... pleading Kemp make masks mandatory foreseeable future. Please thank you.  There's two USAs, one world leader social progress movements, earnings, invention, culture, etc, half lives couch screams better home owner... dude shut fast enough. Let limelight go head thinks he's celebrity. soon pandemic ever able hit high get desperate even pathetic. sweep covid patients rug. ...because there's beds put anyhow. 

- Texas What's + rate though? Yep, Fauci constantly said people shouldn‚Äôt interact spread virus. However yet say anything spread covid massive protests violate every single social distancing guideline. actually cared stoping covid would say something them. tired winning? Im Nunavut none, I‚Äôm allowed even leave here. since mid March NO: done F: know, that‚Äôs almost unanswerable question. many possibilities. don‚Äôt like phrase context we‚Äôve done wrong, opposed let‚Äôs take look happened maybe lessons learned. never got baseline number reasons. Perhaps lack compliance people country kinds restrictions felt would appropriate. look European curve, came essentially baseline, different us. So, [they] stomped infection pretty well. started open again, wasn‚Äôt much infection around. look European countries, shut 90 95 percent country. Whereas shut down, calculation shut 50 percent. So, put factors together, can‚Äôt say anything wrong, know, certainly we‚Äôve got better.

PRETTY EFFECTIVE TELLS LIKE GoFundMe Fauci gets take family expense paid vacation? 70 something years old shit he‚Äôs deal mind boggling. 

He‚Äôs paid dues. He‚Äôs kept us safe (well, he‚Äôs trying anybody). owe gratitude. living bitches heads rent free built manufacturing facility yet partnered company so? I'm one people likes insurance. that's essentially Medicare type policy. wife I, pay $170/month premiums. that's it. Full stop. deductible, co-pay, pocket costs all. go doctor, get whatever need never see bill. co-worker special needs kid. 35 hours week home assistance professional whose specializes daughter's form autism. cost zero dollars service. I'll getting wisdom teeth soon. cost dime. prescriptions usually free one instance cost $4. That's interesting indicator. think person? Specially early pandemic would know n95 is? People needed wear face coverings early kind, homemade whatever. information wasn‚Äôt relied fucked statement cares anymore? don't.. Ugh... people color keep antagonizing police?

If kneeled face dirt every time white person got scared, we'd stop murdering them.

Why rise change things?

Until then, police keep beating shit them, police step fuck up, tear gas shoot physical assault anyone threatens way conducting ""jobs"".

Yea, totally.

Tick tock old man. Tick tock. got month interviewing Trump show stroking got MOF. You...going...to...pay..? US lies, people die.  Past Disney too. major difference past Disney cared ton cultivating image cared. think people wise reaction hoping best preparing worst.

The covid19 pandemic new proper long term studies published, dangerous us wait settled science in.  covid19 studies information thrown open Open Source - like Open Source computer program. 

Scientists/doctors/statisticians writing data proper Pre-Prints, usually open public see, covid19.  

So we‚Äôre getting data, overall factual meaning data changing time.  (We haven‚Äôt time weed important, noise, new phenomena)

Thus it‚Äôs worth pushing latest information.  information held time? I'm fairly clueless comes history, among many things, really know much it. surprised history full leaders chose ignore expert advice crisis. 

Right now, think one person even inept Trump. dude Jair Bolsonaro. amazing really considering fucking inept Trump administration dealing pandemic. doesn‚Äôt look good here. Please refer [this hit paywall.  informed either tho lmao never left first. beautiful one. ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ Sick 20/20 hindsight. It‚Äôs also note that, unfortunate, China thats appropriate government response anything Sheldon Adelson to, giving Trump lots money. account perplexes me. Low karma, comments deleted, talking points regime? good faith user privacy focused little misguided, right? Yes, allows almost inside activities, seem main cause spread.

It's cool fixated somewhere can't afford live, obviously scale back numbers get worse, actually respond new information.  Dumbest country world. hope US come coronavirus crisis mid 2020s feel way. rare Republican support, Baker done god job possible circumstances. I‚Äôm grateful he‚Äôs leading us this. Nah don‚Äôt care that. he‚Äôs wildly unpopular seemingly losing mind chasing phantom political agendas. Brooklyn 99 references everywhere? God love life. Nine Nine!! man?  He's also one cited scientific authors: 2003, the¬†Institute Scientific Information¬†stated 1983 2002, ""Fauci 13th most-cited scientist among 2.5 3 million authors disciplines throughout world published articles scientific butt stuff. That's gathered post. Good. Make require masks. Kids definitely spread virus. usually asymptomatic carriers We're essentially 2 left dealing terrible leadership both. FTE also used determine unemployment eligibility. 
It also accreditation colleges universities.

Edit: add want try apply gov jobs ask FTE terms hours/years experience. money keep handing billionaires, corporations, Trump's family? Trump gave $700 million dollars stimulus money company worth $70 million. Sounds like quite waste money me. Well I've got get one too. chose ladys husband Lmao doubt type caps ? Yep, tests reserved likely sick candidates.

We ignore factors inflate numbers even account rise completely, otherwise give playground covid skeptics claim victory. 

Then going claim victory anyway whatever facts show mentally ill and/or braindead... what's point. üò£ forgot trillions stock market... Yo. Yes. ‚ÄúIn FY 2018, federal government set spend $3.076 billion DHS Custody Operations, $8.43 million per day immigrant detention. Given 40,520 detention bed quota FY 2018, amounts average daily cost $208 per immigrant detainee.‚Äù

$8.43M per day could save lot American families...   Yes. Yes, absolutely does. blew it. sounds like context

Are *sure* wanted that? going feel silly days even higher

how much want wager? second concept.

I worked NBC experience around small camera crews LA midwest.

I believe necessary [a risk] 

I wish could help . Except would home true countries closer equator, Italy, doesn't. seen increase cases temperature increases locally.  Cases keep rising, deaths follow hear Trump DeSantis right along, disappeared. tm He'll survive see vaccine created.

Once people become affected snap Twitter brainwashing, post-upcoming-tragedy, pandemic (hopefully?) ending via vaccine, he'll podium lecture us better future. it'll probably fairly effective, shell shock we're heading into.

I think event eventually become big turning point Americans feel overall health. something already trending younger generations. he's doctor everyone recognizes, whether current opinion strong. He'll get moment complete career I'm sure. think realizes lol. Fascists able blame somebody everything, tale old culture government good peacetime emergency well anymore got Covid-19 test back &amp; negative. told pneumonia luckily. However, one thing confusing. results, large disclaimer test saying FDA certified.

[The first page looks like [and second page looks like state already dodgy things testing, maybe bit suspicious. apologies seem like that, thought least Covid-19 tests FDA approved? not? guess I'm confused now. OMG. Make stop please. Fauci come say one way another risk large outdoor gatherings?!?! settle all. childish bullshit needs stop. public health safely approach pandemic. government officials would listen him... God. can‚Äôt escape idiots. Ingraham ugly cunt wouldn‚Äôt fuck hillbilly‚Äôs dick Reading made sad... Ok, little thing, fucked alphabetical order. Alaska first, Alabama. ""New"" states, Nevada, New York Nevada reason. Europe's active infections per capita way less US 7 day moving average cases decreasing. situation different. no, foolish. prepared shut changes. censored start likely censored tens thousands deaths. harsh lockdown everybody wore masks, reason suggest numbers false now. Anywhere virus taken seriously fairly covid free now. Oh look right. Again. *yah* /s   again. FFS think Fauci could whoop ass companies lying. make announcements, put ""masks required"" signs enforce it. Lowes, Walmart, Walgreens, Target signs single one stores area enforces it. say? mean admit, it‚Äôs pretty perfect middle finger Trump. Give Fauci cover Instyle look like bad mother fucker you‚Äôre it? That‚Äôs like Trump Kryptonite. hates much people like Fauci.  actually know situation China going preconceived bias? China like North Korea. population easy access internet. China US-level outbreaks right now, possible zero leaked footage evidences? Bear mind millions foreigners live China. kids staying home thank much. least school system actually gives us option. can‚Äôt believe many stupid assholes think it‚Äôs OK send kids back school. seven-year-old tested positive corona last Tuesday. Like fuck gonna send back wild already caught once. yes, reinfection confirmed now.

Edit: = Unreliable information Fox News, shock. Nothing terrible ever happened last 10 years due high competition people rely system highly efficient vulnerable. top whole system rely credits fluid cash flow. Without government funding company collapse due 0 cash flow. country huge government fund flooding markey others leave citizen rot. think US maintain #1 spot technicality. shit hits fan Brazil, think stop testing, official numbers stop going up. India. How? Oh no. college football. Well no, nothing keeping cycle going. Also inflation significantly manageable impact 28 million people become homeless month.

And direct payments UI benefits cheap, nearly expensive destabilize currency. like going turn dollar peso, would decade that. man literally scream top lungs years smoking doesn‚Äôt cause cancer insult countless people claiming it... get lung cancer pretty fucking funny. Probably concrete example higher power good sense humor. Nothing really 30 minute wait right now, plus they've marked 6 ft lines entire lines. see what's going Youtube. There's hardly anybody there. God damn, news treats like it‚Äôs marathon. medical condition (diabetic, high blood pressure, etc.), please consult doctors extreme (like OMAD 2 - 3 days fasting).

But, think 16:8, milder version like 14:10, could help start getting track control weight little complication.

And anyone start cutting snacks, lowering sugar carb intake, eat fill full. think there's medical complication occur stop drinking sodas eating sweets every 30 mins. Sadly useful people wear mask CDC still getting data. actually approved change.

It goes different database CDC exact access data.  baller didn‚Äôt lie. careful wording. said masks wouldn‚Äôt protect tbd wearer. don‚Äôt. However masks flown shelves warehouses like like toilet paper did, tbd medical community unable get adequate supply‚Äî we‚Äôd fucked. 

But guess there‚Äôs also times later Dr. Fauci suggested American public ask doctors possibly prescribe hydroxychloroquine preventative effective treatment COVID-19. **again**. almost every day would bring drug‚Äî- practically nowhere tout kind miracle treatment, even though wasn‚Äôt showing much actual promise trials, deemed ineffective effective. Dr. Fauci kind went rails weeks didn‚Äôt he? 

Oh course wasn‚Äôt him. Actually Dr. Falchi walk fine line stepping toes ego centric sensitive man child thought charge could see slowly losing control looking like fool‚Ä¶ Dr. Falchi walk back presidents erroneous predictions, suggestions, childish optimism. I‚Äôll give mask call‚Äî get it. understand disaster would‚Äôve likely happened medical community hadn‚Äôt access proper PPE we‚Äôre selfish assholes. appreciate work professionally individual responsibility taking private life. hope health safety. Many thoughts Austin, TX.  doctors saying this, besides poorly written Facebook memes?

The one thing true: cause death sometimes cannot determined. Say someone heart condition leaves vulnerable heart attack also covid. died heart attack, heart condition covid would listed contributing death cases, know killed person. That's deaths get tallied US though. lot times, know exact cause death.

Now person got accident died scene, counted covid death obvious killed them. Let musk Yes hello? sell body bags say ""fake news"" ""Maga 2020""? Oh excellent. Yes I'll take 10,000 XXXL sorry feeling bit sympathy literal comic book villain man wife never got checks.... Fauci goon Thanks mah dude There'd food production mass starvation

EDIT: Also nobody deliver shit door sit ass day We're still first wave, fool. economy something greatly fear waking one day discovering economy collapsed.

Look Lebanon, civil unrest, blackouts, food shortages, life necessity shortages pandemic. 

I'm already seeing many shops shutting England city: restaurants, novel shops, cafes, takeaways stores.

We're going hit eventually, start stocking tinned dry foods get ready winter, going brutal Christmas new years never again. That‚Äôs sad story. 20 yrs old, homeless sick Covid19. hope things get better him, poor kid! fucking insane. know that, right? also backlog reported worldometer tends distribute instead reporting day.  Okay... right that's TWO states safely send kids back school. Awesome. /s trump entire generation morally corrupt money hungry politicians. generation lazy refuse work. Refuse pay younger generations work demand top dollar pay deny science spread covid.

Nixon didnt senate enabling corruption. old generation much worse anything weve ever seen American history. jackass. He‚Äôs got sucka duckas on. what? aren‚Äôt many ‚Äúsafe‚Äù jobs don‚Äôt require education. quit teacher it‚Äôs dangerous, go work restaurant grocery store that‚Äôs equally unsafe. Yeah, fun choices there. Florida house. disgusting. Lets open schools mouse house. headache worrying. God help us all!!! limiting capacity 20ish % less showing up.  Idk issue is, bud. 

**DO THINK HEALTHY ADULTS GET VACCINE THINK PARENTS GOING VACCINATE NON SUSCEPTIBLE KIDS VACCINE FOUR MONTHS VACCINE RELEASED**

Good God. wanted kill bunch black people urban liberals help get re-elected, better way would letting get infected deadly virus hospitals overrun one get care? stupid working summer. gives peace mind prepare upcoming school year, it. taking entire time relax prepare school want do, that. It‚Äôs time need improve yourself, however need to.

I‚Äôm going 19th year teaching want improve digital learning space Fall. summer, I‚Äôm watching videos attending webinars learn apps tools help me. I‚Äôm also yoga reading pleasure. I‚Äôm taking care needs. Don‚Äôt worry others think time. idea exact situation is. Noone predicted ""a large chunk Sweden to.get wiped out"" jesus fucking christ.

They CORRECTLY predict Sweden would cases deaths countries. many goddamn articles studies need shit. know this. We‚Äôve known sometime doesn‚Äôt anything. Jesus christ. Honestly hope world wide get legislation limiting amount passengers 1 airplane. packed like sardines fucking terrible.

You spend 3-4K business class get seat actually made someone 130 pounds.

Things need happen:

Standered leg room. enough everyone way say 6Foot 8 enough leg room. everyone 4 foot 9, know real shocker.

Seats actually decent sized. mean accommodate someone 450 Pounds. least fit someone 200-240 pounds. standered width seats essentially. Also 2 arm wrests everyone. none sharing bullshit.

If budget airlines die, it. I'm willing make sacrifice. People want $2,000 month income. Nobody seems solid answer articles said herd immunity may possible apparently vaccine may annual thing like flu vaccine. already know cases people gotten twice many antibodies produced sign under.

i expect mask wearing places going bring numbers soon--if already underway. CDC given data hospitalization, current hospital capacity, etc. independent news sources still able get data number infections number deaths information still available everyone. He'll probably sell Vicodins dies. Cases starting increase across Europe. I‚Äôd say majority latter. reality, less 25% country voted in. Soooooooo many people didn‚Äôt care vote asshat result. Sueing what? basically Last Us fungal infection zombies? downplay something long treat joke - don‚Äôt surprised constituents believed trouble trusting you‚Äôre saying.

Abbott doubled dangerous ideology this.

He holds great amount responsibility. Firstly, I'm talking difficulties raising salaries global pandemic that's threatening businesses, whatever say typical trends irrelevant. Secondly, I'm sure live, article Canada, minimum wage increased recently, least provinces Where‚Äôs mask? sub really tries pretend like know people stopped giving shit.  sub along media, politicians health care ""experts"" cheered mass protests people stopped caring. I'm sure absolutely nothing fact half populice refuses wear mask stay home.   must took long admit everyone wear masks. That‚Äôs it. Shit award giving fat, bigoted, shit stirring piece trash. mean rush got it.....? voice reason sea bullshit wish full speedy recovery. Paola keep best inspiration others. Oooohhhh okay okay. makes much sense. Thank much clarifying!  Remember, every place somewhat dark place. scared, anxious, depressed, increasingly losing hope. 

Stop reading news keep mask wash hands regularly.  seems error. adds 1% positivity error.

The state also counting repeat negatives toward positivity rate. I.e. someone know lingering COVID issues 4 negatives 2 positives. counted. don‚Äôt know states way 2 separate stats new positivity rate vs overall testing positivity. shut anymore, country come back to...

Pay people? much? enough?

because people think survive $1,200 month stimulus check completely wrong.

We've already lost hundreds thousands small businesses 3 months we've shut now.

I'm arguing country need shut down.... we're already dying, economically. we're millions kindergartners school attend parents capable home schooling them. That's gonna wreck generation.  Online schooling works actually spend time kid make sure they're it... exactly online school work kindergartner can't read?  parents work home can't spend 8 hours day teaching kids?

I get sucks something needs done etc.. ever going okay reopen always going soon reopen. even think zero covid cases there's somebody tested always going start spreading again.

There two ways this:

Either vaccine ready use, everybody get sick. option c. never magically go away. Unless option C immunity children born covid parents kind herd immunity (pretty sure that's already debunked).

And people already survived able kind wristband something wear live like normal again? possible re-catch thing? people really still saying crap? It‚Äôs overused want pull stomach asshole suffocate it. comes hive mind impeached. Literally impeached con still charge country, causing chaos death. Jesus fk, trying gaslight photos? 

Look another one, another detail, put mask take selfies. 

Believing ""a great mayority"" ""most time"" people using mask protest lunacy. Dr. Fauci new Mr. Rogers Bob Ross. Wholesomeness reincarnated.  I'm Vegas shitshow too. They're already cutting 100 million ed budget, know many kids actually show might lose federal funding too. even union we're 5th largest district nation. 335,000 students. superintendent said masks required 4th grade, cleaning supplies teachers, safety precautions, fever check testing allowing employees students school grounds, students eating breakfast lunch classrooms. I'm terrified. solution. Something tells buried HIPAA violations regulation, even patients caring completely it. government sadly, learned lesson Vietnam knows million ways stonewall media really wants to. Ooooo Donny‚Äôs gonna like Sure, looking headline, still think reaching rationale. likely wrote headline get people actually click on/read article. believe full interview said people symptoms wear masks. quite bit knew asymptomatic presymptomatic transmission high. bet latter. literally never made effective vaccine caught lying once. Damn! hope hell much swag I‚Äôm 80!

#FauciForPresident anecdotal experience either. know anyone Sweden thinks Sweden's outcome huge success something celebrate something countries copy. Swedes know think Sweden somewhere bad okay-ish, nowhere near disaster foreign media portrays as. 1. I'm obviously using word nothing hyperbolically. ratio infection death rate absolutely vital, yet ignore it. 

2. Yeah, economic destruction people's livelihoods literally ended state completely irrelevant you. Telling think I'm another Karen brain, arrogance. 

Jesus, people fucked head. Sweden: 1

/r/coronavirus: 0

You love see tricky small businesses. work dog groomer make decent money. owner shop could give shit masks wear one himself. me, would require every single employee customer wear one live 68 year old diabetic mother. grin (underneath mask) bear it. feel state. I‚Äôve looking countries live. used want stay close family, realize type thing would actually easier separated (I‚Äôm one taking seriously), happened once, could happen lifetime. can‚Äôt country second round. Everyone around painfully stupid. generally fine. stupidity threatening health. want drug take make sure stays mild cause permanent long lasting effects. deal cold shitty cold even flu. terrified damage potential long term illness. line salad tossing medals? Never pay never would.. well, maybe Ranch hear there. seriously.. worn out. I'de desperate 100mg Cialis Yeah, pretty hard rule protests contributory factor. big concern protests contact information attendees, unlike pubs footy matches tracing simple way trace contacts.

Causing unknown spread surfaces generations something seemed quite big risk. Trader Joe‚Äôs know voice actors desperate extra cash con circut literally shut down, work slowed, worth life sign autographs hundred people couple thousand dollars?  none remember guy lied American citizens telling us need use masks work? Jesus Christ! goldfish. Side note, yeah, know masks work use them. Fauci telling us beginning. freaking hero is! GA really hit hard. long? Last year total salary income country $18T. confiscated every last pennies billionaires one time sum $300B. five days worth. keep printing hope nobody notice? What's rather shocking none newspapers cable news outlets anyone really talking psychologists terms helping nation stress this. Literally talk all. 

Fox covers Trump rages BLM. CNN slams Trump endlessly. one find 30 minutes 24 hour news cycle maybe talk psychologist people cope this. 

It's almost like want people go crazy point. I've staying home 100 days ffs people responsible go back work schools. Dr Fauci pretty cool guy. Eh talks pandemic doesn‚Äôt afraid anything mean safe go finally, relaxed enough actually learn. constant yelling around threat violence. schools constantly streaming. saying much KNOW person school option..I'm afraid kids need it
Edited say..your view seems really entitled. say schools can't 'change' homes abuse happens..that happens home...where kids experience life without abuse?? children need feel loved teachers classmates know abuse 'the norm' ugh like that‚Äôs gonna happen, there‚Äôs new car parked next place state license plate Keeping Yankees fans Fenway? good side all! ;) Like, really? WOW! H1N1 strain Spanish flu?  Infinitely effective criticizing him.  keep going bad ass mama! Calling people out, especially medical field, responsibility!

If don‚Äôt work together put end this, never ever end! ranking plastic bag? may seem numbers going keep going up, remember eventually enough people die enough test numbers rise more. rant. see Facebook feed families know going vacation Florida like normal. Pics wearing masks, crowded beaches...etc. 

I‚Äôm anxious idiots going bring Covid back small hometown family lives. Fuck you. required quarantine Florida rest fucking summer. bring shit back go take Instagram photos beach. 

My family love florida go every year guess fucking what? decided love other‚Äôs lives would rather safer knowing we‚Äôre staying home. live without beach vacation means keeping people safe! People allowed book vacation rentals right now. misstep pushing masks start. Otherwise put lot BS kept cool job. Yeah, think you‚Äôre right world paid for? Bet official numbers get better HHS, certain conflict interest, handling data reporting. course reality going really awfully yet here.

(edit: fixing typo) Doctor here. 

I think initial reasoning: point community prevalence presumed low masks weren‚Äôt really accomplishing anything worn public. (One tens thousands one hundreds thousands presumed infected.) Simultaneously mask shortage so:

Risk infection healthcare setting risk infection community. concern healthcare settings would bloom become disease clusters, melting medical system.

As risk infection community increased relative risk infection healthcare setting, mask supply increased, began worthwhile promote mask wearing.

This nuanced explain lay public went ‚Äúdon‚Äôt buy masks, don‚Äôt [currently] work public.‚Äù  worry, handwritten note chiropractor. 

He's real doctor.

Promise.  Look found wild says started may. october would 5 months. that‚Äôs great that‚Äôs personal choice. August 15th Oregon, State Department Education given recommended guidelines follow updated every two weeks giving say district implement. mean, no. That‚Äôs good idea point. live northeast, pretty fucked 2-3 months ago, we‚Äôve done pretty damn good job getting control. south Midwest completely ruining us, whereas instead could learned example. 

We already shut went BS came virus control. states need get shit together they‚Äôre ruining us right now.  governors I'm finding 50 states like 50 separate nations. case competent president know story.

Except mask distancing rules though really see notice much. like roads empty. know ""friend friend"" stories comes infections. many people, guarantee spread. Mask discipline terrible wearers  Thank much good madam sir (or anything between)! amended comment. Nothing remotely close happening going 2016.... Criminals dying like cockroaches, everyone else Oh, that's it? bet like 50 years people saw live offered one going pass. Anime mistake that‚Äôs worst thing deal right now, wish life damn message clear 

The White House clear pandemic virus March 13th. April message 16 days President Trump admitted problem (75 days told problem, Dec 31, 2019). Due Modesty. 

I working grey matter president f*cking idiot idiots elected. Wear mask. fault family members E. hurt soul see awarded that. hate spews. joking right can‚Äôt imagine like working orang babby actually think sub somewhat reasonable times there‚Äôs normal ppl want truth bigger posts there‚Äôs crazy doomers want everything lockdowned.

D614G: Manflesh agree -- also imagine approach shaped. may consciously subconsciously consider much time left make decision spend rest lives locked down. Whereas rest us may time wait pandemic years, may not. one hand, I'd say ok, like anything else, get decide amount risk like take. Understandable. this...this different. longer decision much risk taking, decision affects risk others around well. completely new situation guess starting understand older people may struggle it. government prioritized companies people. reports repeatedly asked couldn‚Äôt let go population. polling closures trump wins, BLM protests gonna look like nice family picnic compared violence destruction see December. Lol. original dude, certainly crime US. You‚Äôre dull little one Deaths usually follow delay weeks.

Florida man came burrow. Y‚Äôall make hunger games look like documentary. military's budget next year would go support this. joined cult.

It's they're bad people... they're people more. They're cultists.

They've entirely delegated parts thinking-about-the-world process people. matter people saying contradictory things; cultist notice challenged, change subject.

In role-playing game, cultists players, they're NPCs; happen upon ritually sacrificing people god. There's reason that. ‚ÄúbUt dIdN‚Äôt DiE‚Äù - anti-mask people still Kids unlikely spread disease, adults. Various studies pointed out. Re-opening schools lead increased spread various countries.

Having said that, virus omnipresent, probably best stay home much possible. Bringing kids school mean leaving house. 

You guys lockdown month. Then, September see makes sense open bit. Schools first open. (Restaurants/bars/theater/ last). Trump admin blaming science. Hopefully record prison sentence governor found guilty murdering citizens. 

Because else call faced much evidence still nothing prevent death? ....yes, proper research done. WASNT THING PRIOR. understand research works? know government something wrong billion dollar companies making policies COVID-19 faster better states federal government. people idolizing dr post odd there's enough money world. Even took money, enough.

Realistically, would pay. matter make fair. fuck is.. mean fuck get million dollar fucken stimulus check goddam idiots running shit. still people call skinny even though I'm 10 lbs considered overweight (at 6'2""). entire world done since march. fuck possible American businesses react 4 months (!) later, country problems since long time? stupidity mind blowing. the.... literally 90% old people anti maskers great. Thanks. say either, said want info. Yes have, new york, italy, china No, Doctors wore protects illnesses research behind them.

Here‚Äôs [an April showing weren‚Äôt taking seriously. warned us, CNN came near filmed weren‚Äôt taking seriously expected start spiking. Vacationers didn‚Äôt help, weren‚Äôt cause! legacy endure longer moron office. true, happens....Do think people going take serious going continue same? + joint = thug life Looks like People always post stories like reddit, whenever anyone suggests expose news provide evidence seemingly disappear. internet rumor spread around hear real proof. possible something like may happened handful time pandemic (either accident purpose) orchestrated grand scale would insurance fraud highest order federal crime, would many would high interest exposing going real fashion. anti maskers say ""I exposed aunt symptoms proves mask necessary"".

The way people repent, write paper ventilator mouth. south done anything good world? It‚Äôs one racist places world. Black men get hunted certain places. I've impression he's wanted ""thin herd"" since beginning. It‚Äôs like masks worked illnesses prior research anything.

God wrong people? fake ness photo really obvious, there‚Äôs nothing permanently mounted walls show hospital.

Anyone hospital knows don‚Äôt wall sconces look like 80 days? Unless insurance normal pocket max (2-6 thousand) absolutely medical bankruptcy. don‚Äôt think anyone wanted year! hope doesn‚Äôt affect family! Stay safe cuddle little one much spend one night hospital without insurance 30K... work trucker, turned 37 last month, masking since March.

 get tested contact someone. paid test ($200.00) clinic/high end doctor, confirmed result coming reputable lab first. 

Tested Monday afternoon, got results back 6:00 a.m. Wednesday. 

That turn around everyone needs. It‚Äôs hard tell going herd immunity dumb. Honestly, Trump really moron could go either way. Ain't America... We're starting reopen (Canada) long strict lockdown. COVID-19 infections low, hospitalizations manageable.

Locally, city council passed bylaw mandating masks fines non-compliance. that, city council also closed streets vehicles high-traffic 'market' area pedestrians could social-distance, restaurants could expand patios streets (at time, indoor dining prohibited).

Today, company work announced though cut hours 20% initially, later restored everyone full-time, company paying every employee bonus cover 20% wage loss. company also increasing minimum hourly wage.

How's economy doing? Yeah, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre winning‚Äù don‚Äôt care. long think lib got owned, they‚Äôre fine child murder. Military may unfortunate you, really needed. lot dictators (North Korea, Iran) governments would happy see US lose military. 

Ideally, we'd use defense only. That's something could get behind. world peaceful, needed, unfortunately, world peaceful. balance struck. way, would eliminated long ago. think true sadly. least Lima, Peru, sex. Basically jack shit. Finally someone common sense! Holy shit, found conservative thinks coronavirus hoax. Go watch Kemps campaign commercials. ridiculous feels satirical sadly not. damn irresponsible that? We‚Äôre going four full months good lockdown measures trying reopen some, assholes wanna come ruin us? Canadian here. ""We admit it, mixed message beginning, even though well meant allow masks available health workers, detrimental getting message across,"" Fauci said checking? exactly Trump doing? what? article reaffirming said. know case photo shoot exactly......?

How hard think put mask? even wear one? sure shit don‚Äôt money hospital stay! stay healthy would burden overworked doctors nurses would probably let fat ass die favor ventilating someone healthier chances survival? Yep. right office right time get away it. lovely little interview! know answer that, playing home, here‚Äôs not-actually-a-riddle riddle: B rain wash no. 1000 years ago though spelling probably different. K used Romans maybe used Britain either. Perhaps reason felt important protest (while taking safety precautions) knew dangers systemic racism creates, especially regards redlining housing discrimination Personally want get whole China statistics debate, whether numbers accurate not. Let's honest, none us really know. trust rumors/reports west little trust official Chinese reports.

I hope countries thorougly think evaluate deal similar situations future. prepared lot nations would surely allow less illiberal/draconian measures needed future pandemics, still securing situation.

Out curiosity though - employer? understand want tell, "" information came independent health experts hired employer"" rather vague claim can't back up. seems almost painfully diplomatic interview. Nothing done wrong, need better. :/ Playin‚Äô Reverse Uno, see! Fuck, I've begun calling fed-level representatives **beg press HEROES act, etc. through**. pitch young fine, older ppl risk worried, get you‚Äôre immune. Turns none pans out, I‚Äôm generally healthy 29 got ass kicked March. 

Americans generally don‚Äôt concept social welfare, throw stupid culture become incompetence government bending markets.... depressing. Looking forward getting again. liked say feel bad Russian people evil fuckhead leader giving bad name, America's basically boat point. I'm eligible mail-in vote Texas. I'm 65. mean, hate gets overboard. believe trope called ‚ÄúArson, Murder, Jaywalking.‚Äù like Pearl Jam concerts. work right ? said back February. definitely extinction level event us. I‚Äôve thinking official reported numbers make sense even though isn‚Äôt news want it‚Äôs need hear.
We help slow actually practise social distancing real social distancing soundbites media entice tourists visit.
Mask wearing enclosed spaces it‚Äôs wise wear mask city busy streets social distancing isn‚Äôt possible obviously hand hygiene. people live buildings communal areas need properly disinfected. NYC realised spreading buildings due elevators use communal areas.
Basically touch door handle use alcohol gel that‚Äôs 60% immediately hands.
Cafes restaurants shown super spreaders countries staff need act seriously stop wearing chin masks cover nose mouth disinfect hands every time go customers customers. It‚Äôs pain don‚Äôt stop virus jobs go ultimately we‚Äôve seen countries they‚Äôve gone second lockdown.
Israel looking like go back strict lockdown weekend due huge spike country.
We act wishful thinking help us. Enforcing rules leaving State businesses people join voluntarily keep economy running stay safe.
If bury heads sand shall pay price August fall predicted.
It‚Äôs end world make effort adapt that‚Äôs all. be. many poor people poor-adjacent people worship rich America need next month. Chile, (common people) also thought government hoax thus worst outbreak region. US tale ""anti-gov"" hoax. boring part culture dumb people. know way smarter cultures. social media fuck us up? TV? Many people knew thought hoax started hearing deaths people knew. much information still super dumb. Imagine Germans best schooling still voted Hitler. secretly often think actually deserve virus specie. wearing masks might contribute Exactly! Stop crackling jokes something make executive power get shit together. I'm seeing Americans posting snarky comments. fuck Trump still office, people understand bring corrupt inept government? Also Millions People Yep, one. need us trying kill lot us off. youre stupid cant take seriously listen üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ like think said piss Donald even ""We"" collectively did, hot-button possibility low income people paid significant amount taxes might helped. welcome. know aware, quarantined 3 months, elderly high risk still supposed be. shops, bars restaurants, theatres, cinemas, everything expect food shops bike shops petrol stations closed. brutal. frightening tbh, yea, 'falling deep end' covers perfectly.

Nothing lasts forever tho.

We outta woods yet either, far it.

But, peak guys too.

Take care, stay home much can, wash hands, wash shopping packages, wear mask.

Keep chin America. üí™ anus tart Oh, sounds cheap I'd say culture societal difference countries. Sweden naturally trusting government, better social security nets, prone social distance.

This corona argument I've seen interesting. Say ""We Sweden did"" covid lots people come agree, mention something like gun control suddenly ""Oh no, never work here, different cultures"" think 2977 deaths 9/11 impacted America. 3500 Texas alone enough even get people wear simple face mask. He's even ballot, he's 2022. He's kissing party's ass. due honesty, US posting record record then?

Don't gimme ""yea trump.."". effective expert would convince superiors right &amp; proposes unmistakably good advice. We've started edge 1000 deaths day again. Holy sexy hellboat

Stealing Thank you!!! really need spelled you? i'm going right source, find llama spit mouth.

what alpacas..? 79! it‚Äòs inefficient wasteful taxpayers' money spend money tests getting anywhere /s Free speech awesome losing lives ignorance isn‚Äôt. believe spreading miss-information shouldn‚Äôt allowed social media. I‚Äôm ideas ideas hurting others that‚Äôs different story. addition that, every social media it‚Äôs policy get decide policies part, aren‚Äôt talking government remember debating someone swore Florida see increase rates, 2 months ago. hassle search past posts, I'd follow-up argument see guy says now. One thing common though biggest boss still shitty. Also surprising optimism people able pay kind loan back 3 years reason taking can‚Äôt afford current bills. me, living CA, covid check covered 2/3 rent month. $1200 fucking bullshit.  Canadian here. city got first case around time NY did, I've wearing mask outside house *four* months now. Wear mask make version pandemic game none moves work virus gets America full-time minimum wage job California puts top global 1% earnings. fatcat McDonalds employees pay fair share society? ‚Ä™yet Fauci said 

Masks don‚Äôt work look science ‚Ä¨  ‚Ä™Masks symbolic according Fauci ‚Ä¨  genuinely curious hear response, trying stir drama wow father worked pretty much whole life pharmaceuticals he's met worked conjunction Fauci I've heard horrible things whole life. man necessarily YouTube shit put he's Saint either. Nothing held high regard that's sure. may smart lack morals ethics enough make despise sure. Texas state government literally said this. TBH actually even important things living never wanted year end badly lol. Public health policy includes ensuring cause panic buying certain materials.

In March community transmission far lower across USA masks seriously short supply.

To ensure doctors nurses front line staff got protection need first, they're priority pandemic, youre told they're effective.

We told thing Australia, PPE fully stocked, told masks worn everyone.

It sucks think government institutions lie you, sadly things would far far worse.

Fauci job. Stay safe y'all. Right/long click, ""open incognito"" hey, let‚Äôs reasonable bucko worth, I'm staying home part. suggest increasing costs Arizona patients guys afford sweet upgrades hospitals over. Ya'll deserve handling state's mess. governor following this. Well...nothing bad happen except us depend school help us make it. supposed work whole year someone kids? Let 90 year old dad nursing home watch me? Pay entire salary earnings daycare still exposed anyways? Or....? Essential healthcare worker zero WFH capability single mom family support.The government sure going pay home year üò© Keep going Fauci! ashamed many young people take seriously. Slightly get scales = I'm overweight

Don't check fuel gauge = run gas.

Don't check account balance = I'm millionaire. owner class bleeding us years. think every time hear, ""people need take health hands""

There lot guns fill hands. Lmao. enforcing shit Dollar Tree. Half employees either wear mask, improperly, even less customers wearing them. Stupid people stupid shit declaring ""it's hoax wreck elections, like flu, nothing""...you dead dumb fucks. blood hands, right. think instead trying change minds ne try open them. Tho think may ""wrong"" us, true them. need love listen everyone really you.

If want more, ask me. They're incredibly immature. That's scary thought. Last time happened Europe... Well called dark ages. live Georgia hospitals fine. hospital downtown Atlanta issues. entire state !! hope wind Netflix show seems like headed towards one specific thing really wondering going break rockets towards one specific event fucking explodes side told going.

Like first season Jessica Jones we're even fucked previously imaginable. Fauci every right boast damn wants. He‚Äôs man. american genocide Icelandic people huge though. DUde waTs bAglOG young people asked ""Can keep us dying Climate Change?"" told ignore science, told economical, told hoax, told personal problem. Nothing done. 

When older people ask ""can keep us dying Covid"" children parents taught them. 

But, last checked, government run young people. young people selling stock telling public worry.

This tragedy fully economic political elite, fair blame youth. majority family loved ones live Floyd County. wish safe bring weather whole storm.

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling way I‚Äôm really hoping find job home somehow gov deathsantis finds brain locks us down. Here's full twitter thread data: Specifically image: cumulative all-cause deaths per million, time periods week 40 previous year week 23 current every bar represents 35 weeks deaths, covering flu seasons instead calendar years, going back 20 years. covid-19 deaths included bars 2019/20 flu season, still statistical outlier.

YOU KIDDING ME. Get life troll. 100k dead Swedes going have? Oh, virus 95% smaller impact expected? Interesting. Republicans gonna Republican, freshly unemployed Indepedents fence getting evicted and/or extra $600/wk could easily swing election. Technically, start $0. 

My state still offering free tests anyone without insurance, refuses use insurance. ~~Downside it‚Äôs two-week wait test~~. That‚Äôs patently false. Many professionals recommended exact opposite banned speaking large outlets YouTube. Fauci going speaking every Teen Vogue event would tried become celebrity scientist. predicting many things horribly wrong led countless deaths country. praised. also know many thousands people survive, 50% lung function rest lives. USA incredibly sick country, several ways. Yeah, important part comment states counting probable covid-19 deaths. direct comparison. Also, earlier commenter pointed Sweden much older population, covid- 19 mortality skews heavily towards older folks. Upvote clever. 45's behavior, denial, inaction make perfect sense viewing Russian-installed agent designed cripple US every way possible cause maximum damage citizens. He's outside margin error sheer ineptitude accidental failing. *purpose. ""The cruelty point. feature, bug.""   Pretty good tbh, ever goes outside 100 people maybe 1 wear mask, add pay like 2000+USD outside using mask, even prison freaking amazing! Treatment...I mean sorta. there‚Äôs double edged sword there.

You might get treatment, could require overnight stay hospital could pill lessens symptoms prevents damage organs.

An overnight hospital roughly $10k. much trust insurance company pay? 

Can afford pay whatever insurance doesn‚Äôt pay?

Do family would infect afford stay too?

When said done, worry medical bankruptcies going roof. Reckless accent arrivals US all. comment attack post, saw s. attack actually think sarcastically. people use mask, get 120k day soon. got 7k 19M people wearing masks lol Ummm, immunity last three months. Americans least year vaccine implementation, *if* afford it. matter time exposure eventually hospitalized. DeSatan really actively absolutely nothing, huh? Like knew useless, didn‚Äôt realize going far way make absolutely zero decisions. Automod, serious issues, see someone help. fuck would use 9 million dollars gamble with? Watch video link. voice sounds like elderly. Wonder directly caused covid19  lot places let return work consecutive negative tests. They'll called crisis actors people need hear most. thing seems work people someone extremely close put ventilator die (and even then, always change mind). post yesterday funeral directors randomly assigning cause death people listing COVID19, they're ones that. absolutely ridiculous! People honestly think anyone died hospital show coronavirus death matter what. want smug right they're completely wrong.  keep waking hoping everyone get together right thing overcome this. Guess I‚Äôm headed back bed, Stay safe everyone! Well shit something dont want hear. all.  time year, 7100ish people die per day US. headed back least 1000/day COVID, number weeks anyway, push excess deaths trendline again. anything trailing ""excess death beat"" sad reminder could done things right. Instead buying new aircraft carrier replace one burned San Diego - print $4 Billion spend people, fucks sake. Probably. Massachusetts (MA) ahead Maryland (MD) followed Maine (ME). dashboard says ""Data incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more, depending jurisdiction cause death."" would normally go summer camp. friends willing patch us week without camp. summer camps closed friends saying ""no way. can't become full time care giver. week limit."" kids stuck home alone day, worry time. options suck eh disagree mandated vaccine could cause actual side effects certain groups, unlike mask.  fuck getting SARS numbers? They're complete lies. salary made primarily incentive pay, common amongst upper execs, especially sales, company facing bleak future, going start looking opportunity move elsewhere. Unfortunately, retention bonuses payment garauntee critical venders, real part getting company bankruptcy. 3 month old given birth peak, biggest fear parenthood far. lot people pressuring us meet people (friends family) long they're social distancing F off. Even mild symptoms there's knowing Covid-19 health road. I‚Äôm linking CDC data, would love see government data says otherwise. German study alone strong enough evidence. Swedish authorities insist reinventing wheel absurd. know situation US, somewhat true country. Hospitals get money COVID deaths, several actually caught that. I'm sure minority unscrupulous hospitals, cases families forming mobs reclaim dead family COVID corpses get proper Muslim burial. Think we're back either liberal hoax 5G wind turbines thousands articles world highlighting infected children... see Facebook increasing number tests laced virus ensure positive results. still figured Bill Gates got manufacturing facilities (or maybe labs) push liberal agenda, believe it. mean, nut-jobs barely passed high school introductory science must know something ""sO CaLled EXpeRtS"" don't. Let's forget idiots charge told us WEAR MASKS first vital couple months still mandatory. keep seeing articles blaming regular people following advice wear masks!! people would recommended beginning.

Exactly two weeks July 4th weekend Babies alone already face risk breathing suddenly needing emergency care, aka sids, catch COVID makes harder breathe? Yeah, risk them. cocaine Mitch anything say (Auto moderator want refer name).. know that. 3 weeks longer quarantines. would pesky tests You‚Äôre buying media clickbait. generational battle shit make papers money. wearing mask bad follow rules couch sneeze shirt arm. touch face wash hands frequently?

Because spread every breath exhale. sneezes coughs.


The thing people worried people touching faces forget is.... Covid19 getting people's hands originated someone else's lungs.



So everyone sneezing, coughing breathing everything everyone wearing mask, everyone's odds touching Covid19 hands drops.


Wear mask, block Covid19 source, follow safety guidelines. Avoid others unless necessary, disenfect things, wash sanitize hands. Imagine dumb enough let come mouth. Another Californian checking in, wife staying home since early March, immune system compromised taking chances whatsoever. go restock food supplies month.

- people Facebook joking bridge Sweden must closed - now. end ICU, get mesh hoses ventilators? SAN DIEGO‚ÄîWhen COVID-19 patients began pour Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista months ago, new coronavirus began ravage much state, shook medical team intensive care unit (ICU). ‚ÄúThe morale wasn‚Äôt good,‚Äù says Dennis Amundson, pulmonologist runs ICU. soon rallied, however, ‚Äúsmile going in‚Äù patient rooms, says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind like going war first,‚Äù Amundson adds. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre scared, sudden look left look right, people it, it, too. becomes kind native.‚Äù

Amundson, 2 years ago came hospital mere 16 kilometers border Mexico, knows speaks. 38-year career U.S. Navy clinician specialized disaster care, Amundson tours Iraq Afghanistan, responded tsunamis volcanoes Indonesia, treated Ebola patients Liberia, hanging captain‚Äôs hat 2010 ran ICU hospital ship coast earthquake-stricken Haiti. Amundson, fit ruddy 69 years old, says still wasn‚Äôt fully prepared pandemic thrown hospital staff. ‚ÄúThis certainly whole different animal used seeing disasters.‚Äù

Emergency room physician Juan Manuel Tovar, 20-year veteran hospital serves chief operating executive, says Amundson perfect person head ICU team crisis. ‚ÄúWho better prepared deal we‚Äôre dealing critical care standpoint Denny Amundson?‚Äù asks Tovar, still sees patients works side side Amundson. ‚ÄúWhen Denny‚Äôs I‚Äôm emergency department, I‚Äôm good. know matter hairy gets, got somebody who‚Äôs got back‚Äîand we‚Äôre battle ready.‚Äù

About half COVID-19 patients Amundson‚Äôs team handles likely became infected Mexico‚Äîmost U.S. citizens permanent U.S. residents live recently visited Baja California. They‚Äôre seeking treatment Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista shortcomings care Baja hospitals overwhelmed pandemic. busiest COVID-19 ICU city.

It‚Äôs early June Amundson stands outside one 24 isolation rooms ICU converted care desperately ill COVID-19 patients. hospital busted exterior window accommodate large ducts, snake pumps building‚Äôs roof create negative pressure suck aerosolized virus high-efficiency particulate air filters. isolation room also window facing ICU‚Äôs interior, allows Amundson team safely observe patients enter necessary. Right now, watches five members team prepare ‚Äúprone‚Äù 56-year-old, 110-kilogram, sedated man, rolling back stomach.

The man quickly deteriorated walked hospital 36 hours earlier, explaining become ill first sought care nearby Tijuana, Mexico, visiting daughter. But, Amundson‚Äôs team learned ICUs, COVID-19 patients labor breathe placed prone stomachs, lungs readjust, frequently improving oxygen levels flash. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost magical,‚Äù says.

Amundson bare handed short-sleeved, V-neck scrub shirt lightweight N-95 mask. five-woman team nurses respiratory therapists room donned cumbersome full personal protective equipment: heavy-duty N95s covered face shields, double gloves, bonnets, gowns. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre midst something could harm you, maybe kill you,‚Äù Amundson says. ‚ÄúYou work hard sudden, mask slips little bit, fog little bit, next thing know you‚Äôre breathing hard. There‚Äôs little bit pucker factor‚Äîand there‚Äôs excitement.‚Äù

The team puts two pillows man‚Äôs stomach, wraps bed sheets around looks like corpse, count three, quickly rotates body without dislodging massive ventilator apparatus jutting mouth. They‚Äôre room within 15 minutes‚Äîone-third time took prone first COVID-19 patients. ‚ÄúThey battle rhythm,‚Äù Amundson says. ‚ÄúEverybody know do, stand, it. first didn‚Äôt know that. We‚Äôre learning every day.‚Äù patient‚Äôs oxygen saturation jumps low 80s 98%.

Scripps five hospitals San Diego network, Chula Vista branch routinely transfers COVID-19 patients, thus far preventing overload ICU. Today, Amundson‚Äôs ICU enough staff handle 17 patients, they‚Äôre 15.

All patients get ‚Äúlines,‚Äù long, flexible tubing, put arteries veins team easily draw blood administer medications. also ventilators intubation is, ICU lingo, ‚Äúuncomfortable,‚Äù staff sedate COVID-19 patients fentanyl versed, opiate/benzodiazepine combo requires close monitoring. Taking drugs risks: 38-year-old man ICU 1 month ‚Äúweak kitten‚Äù became agitated yesterday regained consciousness tried rip lines, forcing mummy wrap hands.

But stopping meds good sign. ‚ÄúThis guy stood side bed yesterday 8 minutes,‚Äù Amundson says. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going survivor.‚Äù

When patients decline near death, there‚Äôs priest, chaplain, pastor always ICU offer bedside prayers bring in, virtually, family members‚Äîwho allowed visit‚Äîvia Zoom.

Hanna Sandor, nurse unit works three 12-hour shifts per week, says job wear down. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs lot,‚Äù Sandor says. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre together, best part.‚Äù

When Science checked Amundson recently, said 56-year-old man gravely ill walked hospital 3 weeks checked in. ‚ÄúA save!‚Äù Amundson said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting door.‚Äù San Diego caseload also started grow steadily mid-June city relaxed social distancing, one day filling 23 ICU‚Äôs 24 beds. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre war,‚Äù said, ‚Äúnot battle.‚Äù sign everybody know ASAP.

I feel smidge compassion he's victim pretty fucked disinformation war country. Imagine listen ""news"" sources like Rush Limbaugh keeps saying ""liberal media hoax"" find dying hospital bed. wish he'd lived long enough speak out.  Unfortunately we're going see growth longer. People caught 4th actually bothered get tested (denial powerful thing) probably still waiting test results, spreading around. people spreading probably even showing symptoms yet, transmission chain. takes see exponential growth show we're seeing likely Father's Day weekend slowly coming fruition. know do! üòÇ I've banned twice subreddit comments ""purely political"" yet feels like every comment thread purely political.

Wtf. people though never ever change matter what. Bolsonaro he's like thar matter guy never take seriously.

We know strains SARs. wrong people?

You say kids contract Covid certainly spread care less chance developing serious symptoms.

What think happens kids, admit get spread it, come back home? Think Covid jumps bodies driveway front door? Covid carrying, virus transmitting children good chance giving parents grandparents? happens sick parents go work? spread co-workers/bus drivers/taxis/in grocery stores?

It's ridiculous obvious points continually repeated. ""Kids contract Covid spread Covid."" country exploding virus many deniers idiots, blows mind. ""Masks help prevent spread Covid."" 

77 thousand positive test results country yesterday. Every State recording daily higher numbers Canada combined. rest world opening back successfully implementing measures stop/control pandemic. ignorant bastards keep spreading lies never shut ""opening back up"" country explodes cases.

I know people represent smaller percentage countries population, proud spread ignorant viewpoints strive discredit scientifically backed argument. needs build wall turn third world country. help stop illegal immigration. fox35 getting goddamn nerves What‚Äôs embarrassing outcry seatbelts. recently 1984, ~65% Americans opposed seatbelt laws. know many adults cram households?

Anyway, please provide one study linked claims. science settled whole transfers breathing thing, study found far 2018 flu half samples contained RNA even know enough pass virus. 

If transfer though breathing talking mask nothing. disagree please read link study, last guy thread argued brought facts proved wrong. mask slightly filter virus size particles ventless n95... I‚Äôve heard sex slaves never sex serfs. fuck they? people think children entirely different species something? case sad. Michigan Supreme Court said yesterday they‚Äôre looking case... local school board Tuesday also approved resolution asking local court reconsider, 200 members community kind drive-by protest around politics. bullshit.

Except part declaring masks effective, knowing science said otherwise, later saying crucial.

Or part speak BLM protests, advocated nonstop institute lockdowns encourage government enforcement them, non-BLM protesters. 

Or part publicly argued February 29th covid big deal shutdowns unnecessary, March 9th publicly said going cruises fine - later tried blame Trump administration shutting economy middle February.

No bullshit, politics. Easter feels like year ago much happened since then. likely explanation incompetence. However, one can't discount attempt bolster narrative almost one dying COVID sinister forces attributing deaths ulterior motives.  gave even slightest indication Sweden moving away herd immunity? leadership unwavering day 1.

Considering hospitalizations still dropping deaths approaching zero Earth would stop now? *""nose swab studies shown children amount viral load noses adults""*

Its government hospitals fault, can't make people appear thin air. individuals fault gave 'we together' mentality looking themselves. reminder everyone. PLEASE VOTE. conversations last election Hillary, that's got here.  Hahaha!!! even realize comment could hilarious. 

(Just case know talking about, meant Mayo Clinic) seem like US govt angling complete public transmission ‚Äúover with‚Äù. I‚Äôm looking outside that‚Äôs seems like, infect everyone survival fittest apply logic read, there's exactly 1 research paper says mask make worse, 70+ research paper says masks work work well. 

Which side going believe?

FYI:

1. spread poop, theoretically can, conditions optimal spread way. 

2. surface transmission rare.

3. virus airborne, travel miles condition allows. needs concentration effective. Distance matters, what's important number people certain area, enclosed vs outdoor setting. 10 unmasked people enclosed 100ftx100ft room, 5 constantly producing virus air talking/coughing etc..., 6 feet other, risk infection still high due sheer amount virus concentration air.

4. mask #1 method control transmission. NY hit hard early, international hub Except doesn‚Äôt explain without hard lockdown social distancing measure came peak almost normal. must virus gets weak region infection falls off. consider America fine without lockdown. done back January. fairness actually correct way track pandemic, problem using data agenda.

We really think birthplace pandemic populated country world 25th infected country?

And yes, wear mask everywhere don‚Äôt trust China. promising news also need right hoping panacea fix.

Edit: likely cause infections among healthcare providers (since ones trying transport otherwise make accommodations existing COVID patients need moved way hurricane), is, respects, even worse infections local population. Italy‚Äôs healthcare workers suffered large numbers infections reduced healthcare capacity. Yes. There's clear cutoff person stops shedding virus, CDC says likely longer 14 days symptoms appear, even cautious.

I've never seen anyone claim shedding possible 6 weeks out, regardless test positivity. course there's ton dont know virus, would unprecedented. reality already here, testing defunded federally need most, testing cases cost thousands dollars individuals. also federal governments interest fund testing ensure one avoids test fear cost? governments interest share data CDC stay WHO? need wait 6-8 months know happen. least got way riots don‚Äôt understand.

He got deserved. high schools thousands kids it. don‚Äôt available room, teachers ability that. Especially get older grades, classes become specialized students taking 5-7 different courses per day CDC folks well medical historians chance investigate it, it‚Äôll super interesting see complete detailed timeline things spread. \#1 &amp; \#2 far understand infectious person doesn‚Äôt shed virus anywhere airway tissue (sinuses, lungs, etc.) won‚Äôt shedding directly via hands. course might touched nose little cloud infectious exhalations, yep, they‚Äôre lightly covered it.

So anywhere directly touch going locally infected. probably much inch touched. virus inert won‚Äôt spread own. Bad attempts cleaning wiping (insufficient bleach example) might harm good spreading around though.

All said, even surface infected, it‚Äôs hard anyone get infected touching it. don‚Äôt get infected fingers, via airway passages. unless touch subsequently manage transfer mouth nose there‚Äôs little risk.

\#3 good luck touching face long.

\#4 seems improbable idea. That‚Äôs said need come close death survive order change opinions. It‚Äôs unfortunate. mass still valid. Also cares verbiage, understand point. don‚Äôt know people get hostile it‚Äôs pointed covid dangerous comparatively speaking Cuomo already writing praises talk greatness centuries. Even CNN like, Ok, nuts. said buying masks, healthcare workers struggling get own, isn‚Äôt good idea.

Healthcare workers prioritized told get masks. think short-term decision caused deaths healthcare workers weren‚Äôt prioritized? enough americans fall hook line sinker causing voted 4 years wins nov. used bad financial situation got well now. since I‚Äôve lived shit situation man, couldn‚Äôt imagine woman kids even consider kind sexual favor. ever since started better really well I‚Äôve decided plan apartment complex obviously rent out. it‚Äôs going completely different anything landlords do. going super nice place, it‚Äôs going cheaper rent I‚Äôm looking make killing anything this. pay employees break even that‚Äôs I‚Äôm looking for. someone issue paying rent, I‚Äôm going give week 2 weeks, I‚Äôm going throw back end. lease up, owe then. don‚Äôt know much apartment landlord scene works, I‚Äôm electrical engineer master electrician turned 30 truly want make difference. apartment complex won‚Äôt run affordable, nice affordable like always be. charge everyone 500 bucks month 2 3 bedroom, will.

Now Republicans get it. Yeah know science terms

Broken balls Everything said right. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying focusing solving kind problems rather preparing school instruction. schools shut again, guarantee it. many us still side unfortunately. That's China law actually enforced. like US wearing mask politicized police departments dont even enforce it. act exists prevent retaliation. Period.

If someone reported sort violation immediately fired, employer could definitely get slapped around Whistle-blower Act.

It matter blue collar job. mom also small business owner dog grooming facility. sole employee well. luxury meeting customers dogs outside. wears mask, expects customers well.

Most businesses don‚Äôt kind flexibility. fact dad feels though learn live disheartening. Especially he‚Äôs willing follow protocols safety around him. It‚Äôs people aren‚Äôt willing putting businesses unnecessary risk longer. 

I hope works dad stays healthy. also hope gets back better mental place. employer screw given slightest opportunity. Without someone bigger sue incidents like these,you'd already bare minimum/no safety equipment. Whichever cheapest them. 0.65% already ""tens millions undetected cases"" Wuhan ü§£ Made laugh. Thanks. good news would mean much lower fatality rate.

I can't think better news (other vaccine treatment breakthrough) found tomorrow half US already this. CNN lies much, way... It‚Äôs already gonna happen due tourism Spain...  Israeli economy much larger $3.8 billion USA gives Israel annually, statement false. annual GDP $387.717 billion.

Also, almost $3.8 billion Israel spent buying military weapons USA. grand majority money goes American companies lobbied deal.

It's completely fair argue Israel receive money that's believe, receive lot less, please get facts right. Yet preventative double mastectomy 2018 due BRCA mutation. So, science OK then.

Also, school age child, family unaffected. Afaik, hospital staff thumb. lose licence, job, even face lawsuits record footage inside facility. media allowed in. (This read anyway). 

We get testimonials via nurses doctors pleading everyone, enough. chaos needs broadcasted far wide convince lot people taking seriously.  official CFR 4%. estimated IFR 0.65%. Big difference two numbers, idea what's happening. They're different numbers measuring different things. Maybe certain ppl die, make sense Ummm duh boy facebook page got little salty! say area survey vastly optimistic seen firsthand. appreciate detailed response, numbers add up. 50 - 68% receiving extra stimulus money making working. looking household income, individual income, HCOL area. representative country. many people huge increase income. point bad thing, money put savings.

Especially person passing wearing mask. theres family 7 walking 2 unleashed dogs, without masks. turn around run way. Yeah, that‚Äôs feel. It‚Äôs bad feeling yes sick people get beds ... theres ‚Äúbut‚Äù. 

And federal leadership pushing us little guys blindly open schools full blast. mess.

And even article puts hospital bed status ‚Äúgood‚Äù. Literally quotes it‚Äôs temporarily good. It‚Äôs getting bad, even schools closed. wish they‚Äôd re-label regulatory capture is: corruption.

You re-label rust corruption like, use iron parts inevitable. Stop using things. cluster 2. mild can't imagine bad others were. ran fever 12 days draining. Yes, getting strangers car uninvited, favorite hobby, now, reach.. Many people including white ppl protesting wear mask. Black people actually risk NEED wear mask guys falling apart worlds eyes. dont see collapse US government improbable.  likely crisis fact. tbh hope vaccine ready November, vaccine election, Trump might win again, can't happen again.

and sars, reason vaccine, bc died could finish testing vaccines. mers, still working current virus. wanted free trade deal left one already had. No, evil henchman Behavior. need lot less dumb supervillain. One comments article says children fewer ACE receptors? thought more? That‚Äôs daily quota good news then... Honestly, set pre-negotiated line sand # new cases per million. stay line 2 weeks, reopen border. 

Concrete target, creates incentive achieve goal. 

IE never happen Cases deaths generally reported county residence. it‚Äôs hard imagine Arizona case could also New Mexico California hospitalization. Years ago employer barred using restroom bid ‚Äúincrease productivity.‚Äù 

Sounds like Amazon warehouse. OSHA complaints go die. complaints OSHA contact manager/owner business tell reported X look it. 

People seem think come stir shit up. Nah give phone call it‚Äôs pretty lax. Employers also know made phone call, time, process elimination. get universal heathcare think problem win. True true Actually unemployment state federal taxed 10%. option pay later receive full amount front pay back file next year 10% taken get check. cost treat covid patient? White purple attack minority asked this. stupid weird MSHA? afaf need ask much landlord pays property month. rent mortgage taxes, it‚Äôs problem.

If less, problem. soon evicted foreclosure.

If exact same, problem. means nothing spare fix inevitable problems occur living cheap rental unit. AC goes out? might legal responsibility fix it, fucked. Appliances? fit fucked. Etc.

The circumstance much pays *isn't* problem paying rent pays. wouldn‚Äôt surprised renters stop renting together. Get campers mini mobile homes watch landlords balk one using properties.

They stop, irrational desires little impetus changes complications lifestyles. could buy home reasonable price reasonable place, want ""live middle nowhere"". want ""tied one place"". ""so boomer even suggest it"". True, follow best practices. 

Which case means kids considered transmission vectors. ‚ÄúI wore mask designed protecting face paintball battle. easily breathe it. walked around store, talked employees, shoppers, every one could see mouth,"" said Florida man posted video showing wearing mesh mask Tampa Walmart. ""It almost like wearing mask all. Nobody cared. That's safety. compliance.""

No it‚Äôs one time lengthy conversation take place call selfish moronic prick politics ever lip service? expect people give lip service actually provide service functional? Wonder low-masks places common... ‚ÄúCan be‚Äù

So Trump-or-die police bother enforcing nothing change. Gotcha. I'm fine declaring ""war microbes"" invading HIV years covid. body bag end? I‚Äôm 25 kids.

The company hiring undocumented 16 year old kids safety training knowledge use dangerous machinery? sounds like safety violation - yes company fined that. someone claim otherwise? may innocent mistake kid, innocent mistake company hire put job. would never million years allow operate crane - least hope wouldn't, jobs unionized good reason (they'd probably let it, seems careless). guy almost lost hand, utterly dibilitating career-ending anyone industry. shit shut down, bosses held responsible allowed happen.

**And wonder another accident short time later? That's happens company unsafe!**


It reminds AMA guy pulverized rock crusher 2 years ago. Part job go crusher's conveyor belt clear jams hand, ""safety"" guy watching ensure machine turned back on, occasionally walks away smoke break. idiot nearly died kept saying ""it's fault, company's, even though horrible accidents accidents mine."" MoFo, absolutely company's fault, fault - blame employees following inherently unsafe procedure. there, would pulverized boss operation. I'm sure company would claim would go business things safely (it wouldn't, lazy adopt safe procedures actually far efficient) - honestly company cannot safe business anyway. Hey, I'm cool side pillow. :-) virus, along many others, spreads effectively indoors. summer getting hotter every year, people spending time indoors.

How many times deniers post low death rate! lot people confused false negatives. False negatives common virus lungs enough upper airway swab pick up. timelines infection, symptom onset, test reliability, infectiousness follows:

Timeline:

Day 0: Exposure.

Day 1: 100% false negatives get test.

Day 2: 85%-100% risk false negatives. people start become infectious.

Day 4-6: 67% risk false negatives, people experience symptoms onset, **infectiousness peaks.**

Day 8: Test accuracy peak 3 days post symptom onset, false negative risk falls 20% (this good tests get), mean get tested 8 days exposure, vary people different incubation period. best result, wait 3 days symptom onset, go date exposure.

Day 14: Incubation period effectively over, 99.5% people would symptom onset now. Tests grow less reliable, false negative rate 25%-50%.

The window infectiousness opens 2 days exposure close 11-19 days later, depending research read. Infectiousness tend peak 0.7 days symptom onset (note estimate). data mostly based people develop symptoms clear holds true people remain asymptomatic entire infection. People symptoms go get tested, test develop symptoms later.

Source: False negative timeline - note accuracy nasopharyngeal swabs (the 'brain tickle'), nasal swabs reported less accurate: window: ADHD symptoms things far worse ADHD.

You think understand that, quite ironic.

Getting covid needs global effort everyone get thing, anti-maskers/anti-coviders like guy spread lies (and covid itself) making things worse everyone. Especially even refuse quarantine/socially distance, least anti-masker could do.

That said, again, world better without him, would better without anyone else spreading covid lies purposely contributing covid crisis.

Think way: death results good things. results non-believers close potentially changing mind covid thinking ""maybe covid real threat take seriously"". results one less anti-masker spreading covid others. results human race whole one step closer getting past covid.

""words can't hurt shades gucci"" cross international borders....? bullshit excuse push kids back school. Kids school stand around texting 2 feet away. go home, online friends near constantly.

I seriously doubt many kids stuck home getting less socialization school going home meant middle nowhere nobody around. thanks! affected areas tajing measures. parts good. new cases city while, pro-mask area.

Another thing, like back march, mostly young asymtpmatic, hospitals far collapse, good. Back march stimate caught 10% real cases, thanks good contact tracing, almost new cases related family/contacts known cases. little community spread, lots tests. Arizona, March 26th, 889 ventilators available 233 use total 1,122.

As today, 945 ventilators available 1009 use (an time high) total 1,954.

That tell full story. [Interviews AMAs frontline health report they've run ""nice"" ventilators. increase ventilators necessarily mean quality ventilators.

Five days ago linked AMA Phoenix area ER nurse here. Morale generally low amongst staff floor. COVID patients pouring resources. Dept health services tell ICUs 90% full that's fantasy. ICU patients sitting ER 24 hours and, cases, sent ambulances different hospitals. Lung bypass units (ECMO) basically gone, machines continuously filter blood (CRRT) basically gone, **we're ""nice"" ventilators utilizing previously retired replaced ""surge"" ventilators transport ventilators.** rough.

If get July 4th spike, make mistake, we're fucked. powers report plenty ventilators frontline workers report sent shipment garden hoses, bellows, duct tape. Karen sex blind, call Keiths Actions consequences think numbers beg differ wife recently around someone tested positive. got tested, 100% asymptomatic isolated safe side. tested week ago still received results, reading local facebook pages people went place getting results 3 4 days others 2 weeks still havent heard anything. Contact person test positive made July 4 14 days Saturday. 14 days would safe stop isolating? stop isolating mean participating safely out, masks, social distance, stuff. 14 days safe assume longer? 14 days amount time would show symptoms still spread 14 days? Thanks! ~~It doesn‚Äôt say age.~~

Read cnn article colds rhino virus. Even minority corona viruses seem give level temporary immunity mitigation future infection. people know someone dies know deny information hidden. Oh. parents lose something. kind point?  Everyone half brain says Pack boys, we're done here! I'm still gonna kick see you. Weird, since article definitely shows people *at bar getting served alcohol*.

Here cant even go restaurant. restaurants patios open, cant go anywhere near bar. Sweet, sweet Karma.  exactly. Whatver say r/photoshopbattle please COVID care profits, Disney good news know getting lazier PPE it.

That's need reminded take one phone call screw entire organization over. Plus, enforcing PPE relatively easy: Use fired.

I used ops manager restoration company booted plenty people using proper PPE. bought shit reason, use it. keeps worker safe covers company's ass. Plus, *charge* using it...so use it. ain't hard. Drive main st Huntington Beach, nobody wearing mask... it‚Äôs scary ignorant people Daddy Russia probably told know want beat people, think possible understand (misguided) reasoning.

If believe child‚Äôs infection serious, believe convey measure least temporary immunity, believe prepared handle sickness medical care still available case serious outcome, believe vaccine far away, believe fall winter terrible time incredible numbers overflowing hospitals child likely catch anyway - idea onset may begin - think could lead conclusion. chain questionable assumptions.

Ultimately, think attempt try exert degree control uncontrollable life. Here's thing. Viral Scientists necessarily understand economy, testing logistics, human behavior, etc. mwans recommendations piece puzzle. 

What done everyone elect single leader create team Scientists, Economists, experts work plan works everyone, balancing safety, economy, national security. mechanism American public choose leader. They‚Äôve worked schedule virus. sure get death rate take conservative CFR/IFR 3% 70k cases day US already hit 58k death rate per month 2-3 week lag.

In fact, New York hit 2000 deaths per day (60k per month sustained) back April, believe. Sorry pedant word case siezed. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt happen me.‚Äù Get recked There's cognitive bias work. People assume young people take virus less seriously would make sense to, rather actually looking trends. see young person wearing mask, assume relatively low death rate, extrapolate conclude young people must like this. essentially idea everyone rationally self-interested.

Moral hysteria plays role, too. Images young people spring break easily spread among willfully ignorant help confirm age biases.

I've seen data mask use age group, imagine could surprise either way. selfish people every age group. anti-mask philosophy pushed older adults, whatever reasons. State house part prevents comparable scenario? 


I mean quite clearly yes!


Seeing Stone Mountain protestors invade government building barricade governor office guns... ever apologize things do. can't control stupid people. lol. place are. :/ blame them?

B. Maskless people turning customers, they've decided profitable right away people feel safer coming store. That‚Äôs good one I'm symptoms, go get test, come back negative list ""recovered"".

How know, happened me. asked posting ""recovered"" results came back negative said, ""because sick symptoms anymore"". back forth went came that's instructed put anyone stops displaying symptoms. Imagine winter we're going sheltered windows closed heat ventilating germs. really need get behind science change damn ways. would true? Came say this. Lots posts there. problem one much variability states jump around quickly useful. sort rolling average data qualifier would help. says quoted n95's p2's studied would likely used kind situation. Using anecdotal evidence, rarely see n95 better mask used. Maybe 1 50, 1 100.

Yes, think n95 would effective much better. n95's probably cuts airflow slipping sides maybe 60%. But, filter still larger virus particulates get through. breathed cold metal surface n95 got similar condensation surgical mask know water particles getting through. can't find research CDC demonstrates effectiveness use. it, I'd appreciate it. can't get people go back work make laid collecting $600 maybe try paying people living wage üòÇ lived too.

Knowing masks effective lying people criminal negligence. 

Sending recovering COVID patients back nursing homes passing laws nursing home owners never get prosecuted criminal negligence. 

Being aware entire country suffering pandemic shouting anti-science rhetoric criminal negligence. think true. Death rate seems range 2-4% cases, elderly unhealthy higher risk death, still significant risk younger, healthier people cause severe complications even one ultimately recovers virus. read many places US case long term residents care homes evicted make room coronavirus patients profitable treat people parroting, obviously original thought they're saying once. flu shot laziness anything else. two! Well kinda. 40k private loans another 16k subsidized loans received letter month ago indefinitely deferred right I'm gonna hope best lol Oregon, taking seriously. got OSHA mask complaint 2nd day mask mandate. complainer realize people allowed take masks tables eat/drink.

Deaths caused science denial:

Obama - 0

Trump - 141,000

Trump clear winner! Winning again! Always winning! whole Taiwan, connected deep state.?....those mask wearing infidels. said weakest point history. Stop moving goal posts, jackass. Agreed. honestly, even interpret blaming him. literally raising awareness others. hope dad pulls through. lot sympathy stepson hope able move constructively past guilt. anyone else absolutely freaked rash stores requiring masks week? assuming *all chains requiring masks whole time*. like trmp finally putting one week - it‚Äôs five months late! another rebranding Fujifilm drug favipiravir, two previous ones. Three state-backed pharma companies different corners country got rights produce drug speed production, one got come name it. Wow, competent leadership. rarity country. Good luck Florida. new it‚Äôs reported awhile now. Mr. Schwarzenegger would like talk possibly saying things donating plasma help crisis. would arrange that? Wow, looks 6 photo. worn mask... Yeah, normally data would sent CDC, managing disease outbreaks CDC's entire job. Trump changed go Whitehouse CDC. Whitehouse could make whatever numbers wants release true. competent administration problem(although would still unorthodox raise red flags), administration would straight lie case number. issue Trump administration shown time time they're willing lie reason Trump huge political incentive get covid sorted election, even sorted paper. Unless I‚Äôm missing something, don‚Äôt think people shed virus via skin clothes. know. Lol Mumbai, India big cities everyone wearing mask. area Mumbai, strict lock since last 3 week top 3 months lockdown before. Situation still worst, probably due high population density. True worse dumb ass idea. case, blame away. know good choice, either. know parents need go work, kids need lunches (and breakfasts, dinners), need speech pathologist friends games. 

Any way go, then, suffering. Russian Roulette virus hard judge path brings less. get kids school sure. I'm guessing many businesses make mandatory well. could arrested sheriffs failure follow lawful order cowered instead. many us get vaccine, DeAtHs it‚Äôll good! /s Well done! 100% design. Look positions Trump fired left vacant filled yes men. easier duties regulate stuff like. Fox News, CNN, MSNBC constantly lying us. They're complete utter trash point. work corporate data top tier Data Manager better boss That‚Äôs whole different issue. You‚Äôre good spot there. messy I‚Äôm sorry us position deal this. Unsarcastically: galaxy brain idea. Yeah, infuriating. 

I live apartment complex Orange County. lockdown, property management taking things super serious terms wearing face masks, social distancing, etc.

Now go office, face mask sight. ask wear one moving move checklist. Add top half people wearing one nonchalant see issue. 

People gave caring it. never cared begin with. I'm college student.

I online throughout highschool younger. Still am. hard.  Right it‚Äôs like ever backtracked approved drug before... couple people thousands scientists even saying things. I'm teacher group Facebook. poll posted recently asking would take vaccine. largest majority said no. disappointed them. always pushed preseason Overall hospitalization rate almost 22%. Fuck. She‚Äôs got Joker eyebrows tho Say Jar Jar, even Gungans understood that.  sick head. repeat. LEAVE STOP SPREADING LIES. It‚Äôs small lacks data/references mini review article.  couple theoretical problems this... young, less risk person lives at-risk people, like within multigenerational home? 

And, unknowns long term damage? instance, big if, say find there‚Äôs permanent damage age group. people residual health problems, different set problems. Desperate times. Imo kind safety net people get stimulus check. Like intrest free loan something till gets figured out, ever. government lets people fall cracks banks(any bank got bailed EESA/TARP) take government. People resort bank robbery $1,200... headline written pornhub mink army! do, I'm ICU nurse worked nothing COVID 19 patients months now.

Haven't seen actual reinfections.

We've plenty patients swabbed positive, negative, positive throughout stay hospital.

NONE patients shown sort deterioration despite swabbing positive negative. fact experience continued improving.

The likely explanation patients ""reinfected"" rather tests 100% reliable and/or person swabbing may swabbed properly.

Now, let's see evidence claims confirmed reinfections. evidence everyone facing direction, infection rates lower. Still probably worth risk though We're big country. states shit together others don't. New York Florida different spots right now. That's said places spiking think opening Would rather dead?

-Tyler Durden good start mask! big chunk saving time comes putting drugs vaccines hold review covid vaccine first.

Normally takes somewhere 2 5 months get turn. comment made, majority comments ""well, course"". I'm pretty sure that's responding to, comment responded to.

Instead asking get much asking get little.

Thoughts like one things keep us down. true. virus still viable surfaces days weeks time. Well opinion aged like milk debate. Kids get sick go school. Arguing level risk infecting teachers position ever even considered. fact 14 year old 6 year old got infected could carry schools enough. going get good information ""directionality"" next month, debating implicitly accepting terms opposite side debate. Start rejecting terms. know, risk unacceptable. even argument. clearly get virus, bring virus school, teachers get sick. ""directionality"" debate core around hundreds teachers die thousands die tens thousands die acceptable losses are. Fuck entire argument core. Meanwhile government could assist school districts distance learning exactly zero people need die. proves virtually nothing I've looked apparently Florida state law prohibits petitions recall governor. That's bad, lot people going die total disregard science realities pandemic he's office. Anecdotal, many teachers personally know taken extra life insurance. live place anything ""under control,"" schools open two weeks, 5 days week, full population every day, masks ""suggested.""

F Yup I‚Äôm guessing 2022 earliest. It‚Äôs also happened  Yeesh horrible situation.

Edit: Another thing consider wanting us clean, sanitize, kids keep masks on, enforce social distancing, create modified schedules, etc etc. going little learning going classroom everything state districts asking us moment. 

It‚Äôs frustrating me, teacher, turning babysitters. 

I fully understand parents need work order support family. absolutely denying point. feel like state needs come something better options given whole community. become teacher teach online, also didn‚Äôt become teacher die deadly virus students likely spread family. infant home, could imagine putting harms way. wish people felt children.

AG Cameron KY hellbent lawsuits nullify Governor Beshear's exec orders protect people. Thankfully KY Supreme Court let orders stay literally save lives.

GOP soul anymore literally trying get people killed. salut, mon nom est slim shady Yea :( Depressing. science standing way anything. **The virus** standing way life returning normal. Well whole state budget thing. would anyone doubt could? would say government becomes communist, worse dead Americans. Right, masks never 100%. fact, according CDC surgical masks significant impact transmission flu (nearly identical size covid methods transmissions).

The CDC says ineffective. I'm echoing research. Well without Walmart Target, shop lol? I'm sure mean here, quick jump conclusions based findings can't confirmed yet. papers suggest one thing, others suggesting opposite. even said 'thats possible', seem real trends evidence it. Yet. you‚Äôre admitting you‚Äôre skilled educated enough find another job....OR even looked?  could clear. think adequately testing many states, accurately measuring. think majority states sharing data obtaining tests. going friends healthcare say, certainly friends ever state. certainly individual states suppressed testing numbers, think mostly past disease continued kill people. point we'll take guy seriously. yet? went history 1 minute seem really angry. Sorry you. positive? Well, one less level taxes? guess. fun talk about. mayor vote sucks ways. means less meddling?

It odd. see slight negative overall. He's reluctant new orders, he's left choice. he's still yet even mention casinos run wild likely big part reason can't control thing yet. goes almost every country tbf They'd stop testing declare ""see... beat target"". you‚Äôre ok forgiving PPP loans large corporations didn‚Äôt need begin rather help college students? wow! learn US done South America actually feel relieved it‚Äôs collapsing world power. think might come next get depressed. used case manager severely mentally ill. job hard good day. I‚Äôll bet don‚Äôt get thanked enough. So, thank much working psychiatric hospital, especially pandemic. anything COVID-19 body?

I'm seriously asking point. Yeah, bother Probably 1000 guess. governor piece shit. truth shouldn‚Äôt stand way good lie. wish Governor never uttered exception. medical condition -- fucking crazy. think mean, ""their numbers"", think wrong.
NY numbers fluctuate, spike like 
Texas Florida. NY people annoyed, still willing mask, 
and shelter place need be. followed science, results speak themselves. Pools watered Clorox.  dumb. deaths we‚Äôre seeing announced today yesterday ‚Äî 100 ‚Äî people likely contracted COVID-19 late May.‚Äù   intent. prevent collapse economy. many motives play - re-election actual need collapse national economy.  harm extending level enhanced benefits would mean much slower difficult recovery. 

It‚Äôs easier restart economy businesses aren‚Äôt abandoned families destitute. *my* poor decision. College expensive, people can't afford pay pocket. think college available super-rich? pay taxes. fault college overpriced. interest going trade school that's specialty lies. Go troll somewhere else. God, wrong people? they‚Äôre supposed educators...scary. get sick, they'll crying hoax. üôÑ work one places. masks required here, frowned upon wear one. get constant abuse wearing mask work now. hate country sometimes. single person argued virus kill cells. Go spend energy learning instead babbling, sound like dipshit. Motorists. seat bealt laws introduced. forget stuff like buying 90% global remdesivir supply ago id say around 75,000 tops maybe even fewer worldometers reported.

Bexar County identical totals acrespoint worldometers...27,047. acrespoint booked 5,500 cases backlogged one day, whereas worldometers went back applied old totals.

when that, Texas appears *slowing down* accelerating. also reflected tested positive rate reported JHU, though still quite high. Classic! Yeah, better pay people everybody else stay home, honestly. Life cannot continue is. can't. need treatment vaccine. one contact workplace breaking covid rules speak, California matters?   First thought reading title, ""yeah that's true, science...

We're hoping lucrative career pay off. 200k+ doctor territory student loans.  possible well. key article understand tens thousands additional deaths top reported numbers secondary result pandemic, meaning even worse official results. key understand lots secondary deaths clustered hard hit areas. areas hard hit, secondary deaths likely happen higher numbers.

You totally neckbeard type aren‚Äôt you? coworker parent school aged children attest well. guys always getting us sick. could looking other, better cures reason people hung one... Testing incomplete inaccurate. invaluable whole community, statistics overwhelm inaccuracies, trustworthy individual level. Considering we‚Äôve heard anti bodies fading time, herd immunity realistic thing? gonna like China reporting 80 new cases per day satellites photos showing people sleeping/dying around hospitals waiting room.

I remember thought ""nobody else would this, inhumane obvious"" Well first I'd like see came numbers significantly lower what's suggest sources. Second chance actually relatively high consider 20 something US like .05% chance dying entire year every single cause death combined. adding covid chance death still like 20% increase chance someone age range die. may 'disaster' sure wish sub would stop praising them. likely going surpass Italy terms deaths per million, far great.

The effectiveness lockdowns whether necessary lot whole bunch factors. boil 'either lockdowns necessary they're not'. 

Population density matters. Social distancing matters. Mask wearing matters. Contact tracing isolation matters. Population compliance matters. policies like working home, hygiene stores - matter. going impact whether lockdown works, whether necessary much impact have. 

That's always nuanced conversation us, like me, get incredibly pissed people jump screech point Sweden evidence lockdowns necessary. a) Sweden well b) every country population different. people great discussing things nuanced fashion, someone elsewhere post saying 'Sweden vindicated!' though they've triumphed that's far truth. 

Also, jumping screeching pointing Sweden exactly they've dragged mud, governments need people understand Sweden's method one duplicated. I'd let someone skilled make call, can;t large number all. third it. comparing Canada thing going nowadays ? think anybody thinks Canada worse, managing worse anything. U.S. running lane. Comparing useless many deaths per day take Texas Governor implement safety measures? says won‚Äôt lock state people won‚Äôt follow order, many people businesses would lock down. lives could saved would take action. Jesus Christ Anti maskers need rethink priorities CLOSE SCHOOLS CANT MAKE US WEAR ER MASK !!!!!!!!11111one 4 years Trump office months pandemic mom suddenly anti-vaxx believes doctors lying help democrats don‚Äôt fucking know anymore lol misleading title labeled/flaired such. Come moderators... know. hypocrites. record. believe strategy.  think states/local government charge response that‚Äôs political belief everything.

Texas local control...until aren't. Local control great locals something like. State banned local governments plastic bag bans years ago, Gov. banned mask requirements (until rampant case spread made backtrack). Asthma too, really high rates juvenile asthma parts country (coal power plants, lax air particulate pollution refs, cough, cough). Daily reminder data bypassing CDC going directly White House according Los Angeles lol top 20 world deaths health care system allows people chronic illness survive much longer. vunerable virus. Hence death rate get facts straight talking death rate. side fucking amazing job beating virus ground. one thing ashamed of, long term elderly care facilities. getting funding sight. complain, I'm optimistic it.

The current POTUS seems basically indifferent student debt issue. challenger seems, reason, actually kind hate idea student loan forgiveness.

COVID-19's peak March April (the week ending April 11), diabetes deaths five states rose 96% expected number deaths compared weekly averages January February 2020. Deaths heart disease (89%), Alzheimer's disease (64%) stroke (35%) states also spiked.

Again, stop. 

You‚Äôre engaging propaganda. you‚Äôre good it. 

The son 21. You‚Äôre right, article didn‚Äôt say age. 

Which makes odd would make first comment then. mean, admittedly idea age, commenting people age spreading virus? Deaths COVID entered country. weeks relevant discussing COVID deaths. weeks disease country relevant. OBVIOUSLY.

No, fewer people die flu prior covid, left covid kill. Why? covid flu largely kill demographics.

But care course. covid matters you. 6 foot lines done much, I've people walk right past stand inch behind checkout lines (not Disney obvs grocery stores shit) Give us safety studies 72 vaccines giving children, stfu Real talk though: it‚Äôs awhile since I‚Äôve heard 5g/microchip/bill gates conspiracy theory. still thing? ""nice people.""

how ""reasonable human being"" return could get reality tv star president!! start calling Trumpvirus Donvid-19.

That might takes get actually want get rid it. Plus it'd hurt big ass ego lol Obviously Facebook says it, it‚Äôs true. idiots reddit talk ‚Äúscience‚Äù. anti-vax Facebook group way reliable. Obviously masks SPREAD Covid (just like 5g does), let bill gates microchip us . Looks good honest. compared intramuscular vs. intranasal application vaccine, whereas seem prevented disease, intranasal vaccine conferred sterilizing immunity. mice neither developed symptoms able spread it. Humoral immune response T/B cell responses detected.

It makes sense, since initial infection usually mucosal surface, would surprising see intramuscular vaccine preventing infection mucosal surfaces. think intranasal applications deserve place vaccination efforts.

Mice good model disease, normally affected virus. That's used genetically engineered mouse strain, expressing ACE2. enables virus infect mice show disease pathology, however model far perfect. would nice see additional studies using Syrian Hamsters, possible ferrets non-human primates (super hard do).

Duration protection would another question, happens challenge mice 3 months?

I hope data reliable continues show promising results studies. way military is? like can't leave service really want to, doctors also venerated people Cuba, communist society people treated exactly same(pretty fairly, considering little resources give citizens). 

Doctors also cornerstones community, fulfilling many duties including social services even housing safety. 

It annoys people shit other's way's lives thought much it. I'm saying that, know lot people like shit Cuba people gonna ignorant. virus wait face realize worse think.

The UK recently published report antibodies vanishing people several months.

You story another today doctor another country positive tested negative twice get virus thought hurts lungs cause death, lot that. want disappoint actually shit Show, shit festival lasting many many days. mean, pay bitched it. Sooooo things happen put village idiot charge. Well sure read anything conclusive antibodies provide immunity. Furthermore evidence showing production antibodies infection may last number weeks(1-2 months). Obviously new virus it‚Äôs difficult study things.... God doomers getting idiotic day.

Now extinction level told you.....and hear out....there 1 opinion coronavirus? sad situation old guard sacrifice try ensure govt crumble due sycophants installed. Never thought before. sure. Good thought though. Might worth looking into! Amazon Prime Guy, there's lot Prime shipping. /s lacks pickle it. bar set low opening churches phase 1, casinos phase 3 considered something proud of. GOP truly sight behold, we're great!

Meanwhile Vietnam laughs go 2-0 first world state look positive rate certain states ( Arkansas, MS, AZ) look volume testing. R.I.P USA... Lol Finally get use old gem saved speaking knowing know then, relied available established treatment Tamiflu underlying undiagnosed chronic respiratory chronic bacterial infection (I military back than, country military extremely slow diagnosis, treatment needed month cheap medications took forever get it). get vaccine early (I rightfully considered risk even though source issue unclear). would infected, could died. letting us savage Brits back keep economy going aswell pays cancel?

If mom/pop landlord deferring mortgage payments rent deferred, we'll wind foreclosures -- tenant anyway.

March 13, Evidence Supports Use Ivermectin Tool Malaria Elimination
The mosquito-killing drug shows effect one month according study performed clinical trial published Lancet Infectious Diseases shows multiple, high doses ivermectin well tolerated able kill mosquitoes feeding humans one month treatment. linked Comment, Regina Rabinovich, Harvard TH Chan School Public Health director Malaria Elimination Initiative ISGlobal ‚Äì center supported ‚Äúla Caixa‚Äù Foundation- says ‚Äúthis study sets stage progress development evaluation ivermectin vector control‚Äù. study funded Malaria Elimination Scientific Alliance (MESA), headquarters ISGlobal. trial conducted Kisumu, Kenya, led Liverpool School Tropical Medicine, researchers tested safety efficacy (in terms mosquito-killing capacity) higher doses ivermectin. treated 141 adults uncomplicated malaria antimalarial treatment plus either 3 days ivermectin (600 300 ¬µg/kg per day) placebo. Results show blood patients treated ivermectin doses induced high mosquito mortality, even 28 days treatment. Modelling analysis suggests adding 300 ¬µg/kg dose ivermectin mass antimalarial drug administration could significantly reduce malaria prevalence additional 44% low transmission settings aiming malaria comment, Rabinovich underlines ‚Äúgiven high variability vector parasite, likely take one approach confront challenge malaria elimination. Ivermectin would provide short-term option, new endectocides improved characteristics like longer duration action developed.‚Äù

Barcelona - 14 jul 2020 - 12:32 CEST

Magda Campins, 63, epidemiologist charge Catalonia‚Äôs biggest hospital. coronavirus pandemic, Barcelona‚Äôs Vall d‚ÄôHebron Covid-19 patients region also handled highest volume intensive care patients.

From experienced vantage point, expert says things looking good Catalonia. series recent uncontrolled outbreaks, notably Lleida province, led regional government try reintroduce home confinement bid prevent second big wave infections, even people businesses struggle recover effects three-month nationwide lockdown ended June.

Campins points shortcomings made current situation possible: lack foresight, underfunded public healthcare system.

Question. happened Lleida?

Answer. likely, nobody foresaw would number people coming abroad pick fruit unfavorable conditions, might infected. foreseen. preventive measure adopted, either health social point view. infections began detected, hard keep tabs cases contacts them, although isolation, got away needed earn money. It‚Äôs difficult terms early detection case follow-up. Lleida‚Äôs public healthcare resources insufficient.

Q. Catalan government insists took steps everything thought of.

A. don‚Äôt know did, situation right clearly gotten hand. done PCR tests beginning, able keep cases located.

Q. tracing system fail?

A. Lleida failed difficult cases follow healthcare professionals needed support social workers mediators explain situation individuals. Also, public healthcare‚Äôs tracing capacity failed. nine staffers assigned job, wholly insufficient number magnitude problem.

  Catalonia ready terms epidemiological monitoring: resources absolutely insufficient

Q. tracking system failing Barcelona well?

A. Right now, outbreaks rise, going prove absolutely insufficient. Germany calculated contact-tracing staff needs well. figured needs around 25 tracers every 100,000 inhabitants. Catalonia would need 1,500 2,000.

Q. Catalonia prepared second wave coronavirus?

A. ready terms primary healthcare ability perform early diagnosis, labs‚Äô capacity PCR tests, hospitals‚Äô resources deal incoming patients. shouldn‚Äôt come point. Catalonia ready terms epidemiological monitoring: resources absolutely insufficient important thing containment phase. order proper containment, essential strong epidemiological monitoring system place.

Q. second wave take place summer instead fall?

A. hard say. manage contain community outbreaks, won‚Äôt second wave. ability exist start see community transmission numerous areas, could second wave sooner thought. also seeing hot weather factor reduces transmission.

Q. home confinement way contain situation Lleida?

A. don‚Äôt know one, given situation, efficient measure stop transmission quickly.

  massive PCR testing seasonal laborers community general

Q. confinement failure terms pandemic management?

A. means previous measures working. Lleida, milder measures enforced 100%. Defining perimeter confinement aims prevent virus extending nearby comarcas [territorial divisions encompassing several municipalities], yet still seeing transmission there. good contact tracing. massive PCR testing seasonal laborers community general. things partially done.

Q. Could legal wrangle Lleida home-confinement order take toll public health?

A. Losing one day means lot. rise cases exponential right now. would like know arguments judges used say measure cannot adopted. We‚Äôre playing people‚Äôs health here.

Q. Barcelona registered 257 cases Friday alone, significantly week‚Äôs average. concerned?

A. Yes, fear Barcelona. find hard believe Friday figures one-off thing, week seen rise cases nearly every city district. fear Barcelona scared Barcelona may contact-tracing capacity, public health system could overwhelmed.

Q. take pull this?

A. need communicate better population, convey transparent understandable information every day happening, people aware problem Lleida. Information essential, seeing complacent citizen attitude toward protection measures. also pressing need increase number contact tracers, otherwise unable job come late it. main thing information public health resources.

Q. afraid what‚Äôs coming?

A. much scared concerned. concerned Spain, especially Lleida, besides outbreak, social issue needs addressed. also worried big cities, population density. situation Spain reassuring. Let‚Äôs hope prepare less optimistic scenario. that‚Äôs stated tho

You think saying shit makes true like one-eyed man kingdom blind. It‚Äôs mask. It‚Äôs part stream consciousness hat makes defiant since beginning. mask identifiable object point symbol agenda/political belief system. It‚Äôs representative. like slasher movie, billions tiny little slashers carve inside, slowly. split 50/50 right middle boomers zoomers experience far. Thats actually bad all. might wear mask see stat. think letting virus rip population won‚Äôt fuck economy worse 10 week draconian lockdown you‚Äôre delusional education system days lol... Pretty sure Target already requirement. Vacancy sometimes better tenants dont pay u.s india beef looked amount kids asking get vpn's able bypass firewall go douyin directly case banned would come logical conclusion tiktok current state much better millions american kids using vpn's bypass u.s surveillance connect directly china. way read makes sound like dog chronic health condition euthanized happened test virus find positive. actually state ""sick"" virus, carrying it. Unless I'm reading something wrong. Simple, shall blame

China, Russia, WHO, Dr Fauci, state governors, CDC, people wearing mask.... etc

Can't see , president working hard make USA magical, virus one day magically vanish, magically US great again, America First. (In way. US top top .... highest infection death counts) Sue them, endangering life spreading lethal disease pandemic. shut might country come back to, continue present course country collapse disintegrate faster Soviet Union Chernobyl  Yuh huh! saying even hated Halloween masks!!! 

Hydroxycloroquine. people calling cure. retailers require them, Karen‚Äôs starved out. Win-win. Guess ‚Äúnot warrant enough wear one‚Äù infectious disease isn‚Äôt enough you.

Someone born 1980 turning 40 2020. not? Money printer goes brrrr ok Judging zebra-cake anime binging neck beard days, guessing group might higher risk fo com Yes, Swedish police overwhelmed number problems recent years 

It still ranked 1/195! good argument mom risk group needs understand this. worse imagine. I'm noticing folks traveling Covid hotspots low case regions flaunting unwillingness social distance wear masks. reason cases. years treating Presidential tweets gospel Jesus Take Wheel approach everything helping muh freedoms crowd. Wait till start throwing dead homeless people mass graves... Yes. He‚Äôs blame stupidity... need government telling do?! treat hypochondria? I‚Äôve struggling year, hoping phase it‚Äôs torturous point. :/ believe still like ‚Äúbasket deplorables‚Äù things change fast days... would borrowed existence. could skimmed military budget. Doesn‚Äôt matter comes - even outright printed it, economic consequences would remotely bad continue present course. USA NUMBER ONE! supernova bullshit

Imagine sun exploded caked every celestial body solar system 60-mile-thick layer cow dung... mean, yeah? kind front proudly every evening remember?  think new 3 minutes test handle incoming tourists ‚ÄúAnyone wants test get one! It‚Äôs already there!‚Äù 

POTUS, March 2020 closed first time establish track, trace, quarantine infrastructure would made reopening safely possible. reopened without that. Unfortunately, realistic way contact tracing work country refusal cooperate contact tracers (or lying them) made felony.  test positive incubation bit risk false negatives (you virus, test failed detect virus multiplied enough reach upper airway yet) high, around 67%. get tested 3 days symptoms onset test reliable 20% false negatives, never perfect. People asymptomatic test positive, know often idea many people positive, asymptomatic test false negatives (they indistinguishable healthy people)

Timeline people develop symptoms: Omg. doesn‚Äôt require symptoms. That‚Äôs whole point, people damage without symptoms. Look up. thousand articles it, drs talking month more, clearly don‚Äôt want bother even see correct. Hot take: make open theme parks. ""HoW MaNY die FLu!??!""

Let politicians guinea pigs one. nothing nefarious, got it, straight stupidity incompetence. can't blame people live bigger terror COVID19. churches? White House's Fumbling Coronavirus Crisis Could Kill ~~the College Football Season~~ EVERYONE still kept job, stay home time, economy going back, people take safety precautions seriously before. good way I'm scared people leaving country spend holidays come back virus, spreading back according medias Sciensano (official stats Covid). Meanwhile governor blocking cities counties putting mask mandates place even suing Atlanta mayor choice mask mandate city Atlanta. I'm one office right wearing mask reasonable use state local resources sorted top/this hour basically stories countries taking precautions cases tick this. Care home tests go local testing centers, get collected courier national centers...please honest. Thank goodness paperwork needed order inflame popularity Mind spurs Fauci hero country needs imo Everyone asks opinion hears thing, even seen worst. stimulus ends also seeing numbers cases simultaneously exploding reinforcing opinion. Also add end rent, loan, forgiveness programs perfect storm brewing bad time. Consider first 4 months starting March least nationwide shutdown Trump actually giving daily briefings (useless least acknowledged virus). recent days makes think yanks never land moon.

They cant even manage wear masks, listen doctors....they didnt land moon. lol!!

ROFL!!!! PMSL!!!! I‚Äôm sure viewpoint post.

It seem thatSweden, like countries, recurring weekly peaks valleys due lags reporting weekend.

That said, it‚Äôs clear Sweden‚Äôs response failure compared neighbors. Even wsb approve post like Great. wonder many people killed carelessness many medical resources sucked up. wait everyone thing maybe take basic precautions known hundred years couple hundred thousand people dead. Yeah, doubt it. Why? Stay tuned find *who's getting fucked tonight?* sanctions North Korea prevent developing nuclear weapons. hurting peasantry. top that, hostile stance gives leaders perfect excuse anti American rhetorics. wear P100 mask doesn‚Äôt filter exhalations all. don‚Äôt covid wear mask religiously (and airtight giggles), contact people, shared unfiltered air, decontaminate everything exposed. sending to?

The president advised drink bleach? work home anyway, wife go work. kids 9 weeks without able even go outside bit different, we're good team. single argument house whole time. wife missed going coffee supermarket together, big deal. Drag fucker WH ankles. crap Yeah grim like 8 states 1500 cases everyday yeah grim conservatives place American lives less worthy lives people around world live countries keeping virus control? conservatives decide American lives aren‚Äôt worth effort? ‚ÄúHey guys! Guys! know child isn‚Äôt person article, don‚Äôt say anything! I‚Äôm sure everyone come educated conclusion reading articles full wary eye none us mention folly systems! don‚Äôt talk it, it‚Äôs sure get better!‚Äù Feel awful newborn, especially father baby anyone says oh cares it‚Äôs old people, let alone saying children can‚Äôt get it...

No one said children can‚Äôt get it, moron. left first wave yet. Probably realistic version happened. agree. statement statement identical minus unnecessary insult. Trump said it, going get tired winning Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Lol chiropractor worked doesn‚Äôt believe either. like death rates think we‚Äôll got high infection rates give time deaths happen. Hate healthcare providers misinformed. Also even don‚Äôt die aftermath doesn‚Äôt sound pretty (organ damage medical bills) stupid think entire planet 4 seasons? feel blessed. school district making sure every family high speed internet. Low income families get free.

There absolutely in-school instruction first quarter 2020-2021 school year. probably in-school instruction second quarter.

Our school district making best bad situation. Every school district handling crisis similar way, unfortunately not. Almost 0% 1% earned money. Serious question. MAGANs concerned individual ""freedoms"", protest seatbelts? Britain also showing signs second wave. Herd immunity works! Bullshit.

You 'users' (in derogatory sense programmer pronounce word) 'chosen' employ Microsoft O/Ss platforms. Riddled security flaws, easily hacked 8 year old Kali distro...yet whine like petulant children russia russia hacked that. running MS based systems...this 'is' self explanatory. willfully keep sensitive data machines tied internet, choose store said data web...which dumb fuck.

&amp;#x200B;

""The ruskies keep hacking WinXP server. They're evil!!"" Yeah...sure...coming society refuses listen top doctors, refuses wear masks, protests said masks carrying automatic weapons, rages screams haircuts, attends covid-19 parties spreading carriers like butter, oh...willfully promotes racial hatred constantly referring virus racial slur two instead proper name given scientific community (the assholes studied shit confuse you).

&amp;#x200B;

Its Russia bad...its nation incompetent things does. need tribunal judges bring murders account. Wondering cross-immunity going turn benefit people like teachers parents constantly-snotty young children, given higher chance recently encountered less serious coronavirus. Right? think welfare handout pandemic, imagine really feel someone normally loses job fault own. death cult denial. said West handle virus like China. Yes, it‚Äôs Obama‚Äôs fault. White House think controlling data hospitalizations stop?

They care hospitalizations. that's Sir Chad Sure. media trying propagandize virus. everyone knows make sure information opining things. 

Just agree propaganda doesn‚Äôt mean also engage it. [He says rally super big boy proud names think Good job Kemp... managed make Florida look better.

Wow. even mean? happened Obamagate? go anywhere? Yup. Fauci Alex Trebek infectious diseases, class. $400 per hour glorified Bouncer INSANE.

The average salary Bouncer $12.92 per hour United States. Maybe double high cost living states. I'm sorry legal system consequences assaulting innocent human beings...I guess. Cause they‚Äôre grifters looking 15 minutes? That‚Äôs thing worry‚Äôs subreddit. laser focus masks seemingly ignoring mitigation measures (some even effective). Masks help, part solution. Get shit wtf, wsb That's different outcome local testing centre, care home getting tested weekly, they've lost entire lot twice still waiting last 2 tests come back,. Trump sell ""MAGA"" ""Trump"" branded face mask we'd set he'd help fund campaign. anti-mask nutcases would probably even end spectrum getting violent people wearing mask. could even dealt inevitable ""my masks best masks, one creates better mask me, credited stopping corona"" would come. Yeah, cuz summer 90 north, need hotter! I, one, shocked. anyone know includes probable cases? article say. agree- could lot worse, let's wait see goes. isn‚Äôt valid reason assault someone follow around arguing provoke someone. Ask leave, call security deal wait police. absolutely fire employee, would shoplifter. Japanese culture 'swipe problem rug' bite asses hard time. available there's black people, I'll bet, Trump allow it. Yet Mississippi, numbers posted online, inevitably going brought every time, along recovered, fake deaths, flag.. it‚Äôs never ending cycle. reason shut new york down. regional thing point. Plus never going pay people stay home. fuck granny, right?!  First caravans south, caravans north. Human wannabe feel like days remind humanity gone situations like come it.

This end us one day memory hopefully reminder better one another. I've heard week he'd announce Friday like last time around. Newspeak consecquence Trump stupid speak. punishment assault, refusal school work. article's headline dishonest. Shocking.. /s Holy fuck thoughts. I‚Äôve literally told way get everyone months without financial consequences absolutely would. It‚Äôs possible PA spiral control Gov Wolf least responsive sometimes proactive reducing spread. Watching GA free fall terrifying though. mom sent half dozen cases knew personally like 36 hours Monday Tuesday. appears happening least little UK, [the story broke  cannot escaped anybody's attention ""less economically advantaged"" races dying far greater rates ""original settlers"" whose deserved destiny take land.
  
If COVID took millions deaths minorities would take comparatively massive hit. wondered could racist motive mask refusal, hard judge crazy people are. people also stand lose grandparents guess would care one jot fellows. chance screenshots post PM with? president believes lot shit, probably best example America. right article filled speculation. scientist unable look supportive data(which usually look reading article) don‚Äôt speak German. It‚Äôs understanding cells naturally occurring body one cannot simply assume role immunity could positive negative(immune dominant type response like dengue fever). quick google search seems like lot attention given cell responses right typical antibodies fade quickly. biggest proponent better 99 guilty go free one innocent put jail. legal system designed. doubt innocence project going take assault theft case. yeah, trump pretty fucking awful canada, rhetoric policy. lemmings follow happily, gonna hard regain respect americans get act together. strict really? Like walking around outside park downtown? Listening news conference Kemp right now. Lots talk increasing case rates plans increase hospital bed capacity free masks handed out, nothing requiring people wear masks keep people beds. (He recommend everyone wear one) also talks increasing testing, mention far contract tracing make use testing data. math infectious spread means putting blame societal problems feet individuals. exponential, every person infected potentially get 100s people sick degree two separation. 

I agree rent mortgage suspended March allow us choose work expose get evicted don't. Yep, we‚Äôve 2 cases work.. one cases lost family member people work still won‚Äôt wear mask scream it‚Äôs made up. It‚Äôs mind blowing. term ""en mass"", ""in mass"". Also, earlier wrote ""kills eons people"". Courts overall decided legitimacy laws. like U.S. Supreme Court. Seems correspond travel opened could explain Spain jumping high amount summer tourists Europe 1. lot deaths per capita
2. shut people working home, seeing many people, stores implementing protective barriers cashiers etc. Acting responsible smart going save us. Right now, neither happening. Again, doubting either.

But I'd rather Boris take seriously initially, get hit virus pull pants... opposed Trump never taking seriously digging heels in.

Bolsonaro's idiotic response also worst-case.

Some countries take seriously finally grip now, better late never imo. Sure. hospitals got overwhelmed first wave everyone needed care could get care. things don‚Äôt change really soon it‚Äôll story Texas, Florida, Arizona. They‚Äôre almost breaking point daily case numbers still rising.  Imagine protesting made way worse haha do. countries using masks good. happening everywhere spreads like USA Brezil people wear masks.

At point, know that, WANT know it. extremely easy find information. Thank stars Fauci S___ ! forgot World Cup! It‚Äôs Qatar 2022. US, Canada, Mexico 2026. hope don‚Äôt lose US failure.

Damn! take least 2-3 years change clean mess. Daddy Fauci trust help sites seem legitimate, ([aaps](aapsonline.org)) twisting information convince people go best interests it‚Äôs like NY NJ now. Testing way easier quicker, widely available. regions country watched us learned absolutely nothing. They‚Äôre going 4 months ago like surprised pikachu face meme. US could both, apparently, US poor invest adequate testing. However, trillions bailout corporations affordable. clear US politicians hiding ball enable corporate welfare steer bailouts donors. greed virus spreading throughout America cause reckoning. say makes sense. work cooperative it‚Äôs owned members live I‚Äôm almost certain would side boss managing agent. want us matter even tried force us come state‚Äôs stay home order. I‚Äôve contacted OSHA attorney general regards various hazards workplace. far nothing it‚Äôs week. pArTy LiNcOlN ü§£ believe actually represented others interests? Honestly people power petty selfish looking self interest. Medical professionals work Covid patients day every day months exposed. careful PPE process, done. Ordinary people seeking infected spend time little difficulty. ""all nothing"" thing, layers security. mask 100% effective prevention doesnt mean use it, add behaviors methods help improve odds. Like social distancing, improved hygiene to, lockdown.

Also, US, hold breath waiting around government save us. Nothing said political. large gatherings pandemic. remember months ago subreddit ok criticize large gatherings obvious dangerous behavior. political changing tune, based gatherings occur? person pointing obvious way March. can't spell virtue gave question critical writing skills I‚Äôm smart enough understand directly said wear masks Form union quit together till make online only. That's way, start reaching now... Well ypu aremt really mate. Effective would playing Trump useless fuck. 

Standing next dumpster fire worst case senario saying ""well...not fault I'm great."" qualify effective. Quite opposite. time reverse then: literally possible, politically not.

Total martial law 0 un-isolated/traceable cases 1-2weeks.

Should take 3-6 weeks.

Plenty time till Christmas.

One fucked things virus, we're collectively making *Zapp Brannigan* look like Sun ""You see, killbots preset kill limit. Knowing weakness, sent wave wave men reached limit shut down. Kif, show medal won."" Well, fight happened stole buds; suspect theft larger problem. *You‚Äôve always fucked, didn‚Äôt know yet 

Happy Friday! politics. bullshit. real talk. Fauci 2020.

He's excellent right is. good policymaker equate good politician, I'd 1000% comfortable Fauci current position (or higher one, exists) backing next president health policy would ticket.

I work policy government, trust say us like jobs consist paid give well-thought out, detailed fearless advice without sanitize public. give elected folks details matter, Comms makes understandable lay public. *That's* real smart people government are, trust institutions pay well, they're generally pretty good it. US pandemic Inc's ""very easy"" difficulty. Keisha Lance sure like bottom. least he's taking seriously initially. student due start first year uni (in UK, obviously), I'm really hoping worst behind us, time tell. yet get colds, sometimes exact virus, once. wish smurt enough make two studies play well head.

http://www.columbia.edu/~jls106/galanti_shaman_ms_supp.pdf Found another maskhole, they‚Äôre everywhere People 60 deserve die? lied make sure enough masks hospitals people could treated masks came. strat either lie hospitals fully staffed become less disease breeding ground among vulnerable orrr tell truth ans hoarders full send ans hospitals supplied. criticizing supply chains developed got us mess. whole thing joke come December itll vaccine forget....poof

I thought 15 cases would soon zero. would gone Easter. on.... advised risk people really careful exposure generally social distanced. [I'm sure made well-founded sound opinion reliable sources incident led current situation happened Nov. 6, someone called police hearing Charisse crying ‚ÄúHelp me!‚Äù honking car‚Äôs horn. Grace, upset couldn‚Äôt go friend‚Äôs house, reached inside car try get mother‚Äôs phone bitten mother‚Äôs finger pulled hair, according police report

""Biting somebody's finger. Blasphemous child!""

She's AHDH btw. know. Quite many european countries showing signs second wave, seems signs happening southern eastern europe. WHO's europe covid-19 dashboard handy checking figures. feel like could possible detach Florida series small nukes along border... Japan US different many ways. 25% teachers quit time, plans school re-opening going put shelf. 

You power stop decision. Also, would keep us alive, healthy, able return work get economy rolling disaster over.

Speaking someone contracted covid likely work still bed ridden four months later. rate blood vessels, organs, nerves repair themselves, team doctors I've seeing expect healing time line months ~ years, damage permanent. young healthy risk factors, too. 

There ton people needing disability done with. 

How handled federal level criminal. high school always got Friday detentions coming school late. 

BUT punishment skipping Friday detention school suspension following Tuesday, saw absolute win-win. 

I think missed every Tuesday semester personally made rethink policy that's lonely unloved, naturally options limited. try harder you, far options life. good luck! Give time. Florid gonna show NY done. take country back. January 1, 2021 see start fixing thats broke past 4 years. Govt role role begins safeguarding people. current leaders could give fuck problem staying home? I'm amazed confident admitting pedophile Problem mask isn‚Äôt going protect wearer people starting understand mask protects community. requires science education grasp vaccines.

So we‚Äôre trouble. forget 560000 tests/million yeah second wave here. like inaction Sunday - seeing private gatherings main catalyst, leaving decision weekend full parties good weather. Oh look another stupid garbage blog site. even actually funny. Another wsb wannabe. Hi. type masks wearing? Medical fabric? Kindly please specific (e.g. cotton 3 layers). Thanks advance. i've thinking, maybe guys get rid eagle replace karen. really suits guys lot better. purposefully infect healthy people mild cold caused coronavirus give immunity.

Pandora's box opened. partner lived 40 years 11 years. say almost daily selling house next year strictly based poor politics. People obsessed deaths.

""recovered"" Fauci jan-mid March: ‚Äúnothing worry Americans shouldn‚Äôt change habits, go cruise.‚Äù Whoever owns debt accept never get paid. many hospitals ""sell"" debt debt collectors reduced cost get paid within certain amount time. better get half instead nothing person declares bankruptcy. Debt collectors willing take risk small debts often get pay larger debts often convince courts give something.

As happens you, depends much money have. court determines eventually pay debt, they'll mandate that. court mandate sell things own. Like forced sell home car primary one. But... nothing, pay nothing. 

Bankruptcy court mandated negotiation honestly. debtors making case done court rules. credit even necessarily fall basically nothing. worst impacts bankruptcy goes away 3 years. can't get high quality ""full trust"" type loans credit. 7 years like never happens. 

It's possible live US crappy credit. friend declared bankruptcy young various reasons. bought car always safe places live. got credit cards year two.. pay upfront. Like might pay standard deposit rent apartment, would pay last month's rent advance top everything else. Yet apparently covid big concern media almost completely ended covid-19 coverage, threw support behinds hundreds thousands people gathering huge groups protest, breaking lockdowns, social distancing, infrequently improperly wearing unprotective masks, etc. Seriously fuck wrong americans thinking go living normally mask, live lebanon city less 5 cases quarantine wearing mask everyday limiting daily route from/to home work, Covid-19 big fuckin deal! disaster. It‚Äôs clear, bad leadership directly leads extreme spread virus. extent that's oversimplification, though.

Some governors (like Beshear) trying sorts things curb pandemic via executive order, blocked every step way state legislature.

Other governors (like DeWine) seem realized they're legislature opted repeatedly *ask* people things delegate mandates county/municipality level.

Do understand capitalism works? suck every cent populace, even means people die. work one companies. got email telling us enforce it. allowed tell people wear mask aren‚Äôt wearing one. It‚Äôs basically suggestion. funny one stops Republican Democrat stores like Costco Trader Joes enforce mask rule. 

All sudden, mandates ok! look it. see useful statistic article. Without number tests performed positivity rate said tests, total numbers mean anything. increased testing North East, finding many asymptomatic positive results, positivity rate testing around 1-2% Massachusetts, one densely populated US states. 

That said, aside North East, US definitely dumpster fire territory right now.

From tell, Canada national average 3-4% (compared 0.4% Vermont) positivity rate testing, yeah, original article click bait. Fauci confident Oh know. thing government side. Trump said inject disinfectants, rallied around wearing mask, henchmen repeat shout exact propaganda, many leaders around country joining in.

Mumbai city seems seeing decline rising cases. Delhi Chennai (These 3 cities major hotspots country). However, problem cities states seeing surge cases. even though Mumbai seems better, cities (Eg: Thane) close seeing rise infections well.

Basically, first major hotspots better, new hotspots emerged.
Testing also ramped quite highly, we're gonna seeing confirmed cases. I've completely lost patience people think left right issue. We're middle full blown national disaster, people need help. like within 2 weeks. entire country fall apart. 50 Million Americans 10% population.

They insisted children rarely got sick, spread efficiently it.

From statistic professions affected seems right. School teachers ""average risk"" getting corona. Taxi public transport dangerous ones, 4-5 times average.

Worldwide, hit 14 million cases tomorrow

U.S. break 4 million cases probably 4-5 days

Unless theres good evidence contrary, pinning behaviour attitude actually victim blaming cohorts pressured ""re-open economy"" strategy. would really attractive get like New Zealand (no cases community, quarantine hotels).

Nobody delivers food everywhere, people still going stores delivery workers still need deliver. time around people don‚Äôt live with, don‚Äôt wear mask, endangering them, could infected, could infected, might know could asymptomatic . heard before, actually? heard therapist's office. I'm basically repeating advice gave told anger rage centering around covid. orange, toxic agent orange insecure tiny seeds peel. Imagine indoors relatively close Joe Corona - Corona - mask

Joe Corona coughs. Droplets expel air. Microscopic viral particles easily enter respiratory system.

Result - high risk - Standard surgical Corona - mask

Joe Corona coughs. Droplets expel air. Microscopic viral particles breach mask easily enter respiratory system. 

Result - high risk contraction (maybe *slightly* better nothing evidence scarce - Corona - mask

Joe Corona coughs. Droplets ***blocked*** mask. Viral particles remain near face body. 

Result - Lowered risk contraction. - Corona - mask

Joe Corona coughs. Droplets ***blocked*** mask. Viral particles remain near face body. 

Result - Lowered risk contraction. is, however, critical component OANNanism. thank much that!!!! never seen jesus classic!  really supposed cry Deliverance? strong reaction, remember crying.

I recently caught movie Jon made early 70s played earnest liberal came small island South Carolina work school uneducated poor black kids insisted giving real education, fighting racist pushback. dated, great, deep, touching movie. (and make cry.) know hell happened him.  

I looked up: ""Conrack."" Unemployment insurance expire July 31. extra 600/week. What's gonna happen there? forklifts can't driven remotely.

If drone flown remotely, make remotely driven forklift. test sensitivity PCR Cycle Threshold (CT) cutoffs cheap test availability could worse checking TWiV 640 orange things, matter... first reaction irritation US still lashing Cuba events happened 60 years ago. US's accusations correct thought, Cuba trafficking doctors pocketing 80% pay, understand push blacklist prevent exploitation.

Rubio Cruz part party lying teeth right would want see proof claims. think bit optimistic this. paint picture happened here. point Netherlands cases really high ICUs full, start pandemic. worldwide shortage medical masks testing sites established now, combined shortage testing. worked care home facility time. point tested absolutely necessary. means, people coming ER people care facilities without doubt showing symptoms (low oxigen levels, combined fever). outbreak work place. clients got tested, many got negative results tested again, waiting period 24-48 hours. Many clients died first test second one. Luckily went hard lockdown little client client infections. could get tested first one half month since infections. testing capacity increased work force could get tested, would test people sick, others told come in. actually could get tested yet reasons, one colleagues situation got sick, never able go test. called every institution could help avail, luckily survived. coughing made stay home isolate. point infections control, people died rest full lockdown. Luckily weeks national lockdown cases died able test pretty much everyone.

In US, basically situation used in. enough testing sites, capacity labs reached. People waiting WEEKS results. we've seen early stages pandemic people average need 7 days start really feeling it, average 7 days start become critical. weeks wait result. think disastrous multiple reasons, one means clear grasp current amount cases, two lot positive people walking around waiting result. point two, clear people isolate moment type symptom could related covid, I've read reddit worker rights think safe assume many cases people allowed take time off, perhaps even realize believe isolating. Also many people die, without diagnosis, actual severity pandemic unclear fact, death statistics compared previous years.

I could pessimistic hope people realize gravity situation. wonder anyone help see COVID back febuary?

I sore throat, terrible fever, chest congestion, fatigue (couldn‚Äôt get bed days) wet/productive cough. wet cough(coughing mucus) makes doubt since I‚Äôve heard COVID dry cough. 
Can anyone relate? week's study may counter research. ""We showed multi-institutional study reason believe certain ABO blood type lead increased disease severity, defined requiring intubation leading death,"" said Dr. Anahita Dua Mass General, led study team.   course not. He's scientist. time that. keep he's always done can't decides time move on. hate countries would go nationwide lockdown fast even small fraction numbers, that‚Äôs even possibility US. It‚Äôs absolutely mind boggling MMR group ""Recommended adults meet age requirement, lack documentation vaccination, lack evidence past infection"" footnotes seems mostly talking people higher risk coming contact infection might received less potent vaccine past. So, looks like case ""just sure"", unlike Td requires boosters every 10 years known immunity wanes. Almost it?

To paraphrase Churchill, getting past peak new cases end. even beginning end. bit luck, might end beginning. Scary thought must be. Americans going infected, when. *200,000 years stroke thinking hospital bill. Absolutely everything want doctor, coworker patient perspective. honestly can‚Äôt recall last time inside grocery store. Order groceries online, peasant collects it‚Äôs ready arrival. even bring put vehicle, simply wonderful service around long COVID scare. Hell even get shipped house, believe there‚Äôs service called Shipt terrible reviews. Well, know that. Thanks info. Breaking bad season 4 spoilers _Anti-vaxxers entered chat_ could give you... 3.5 millions so. gets higher minute. They're busy bean parties. 

All say teachers especially many family well, hope enjoyed 3 months get ready experiencing private sector since reopening. 

Everyone enemy, every work place says practice safety, reality crap show elites laughing mansions hunkering down.  Jesus, read Macron first thought meant France sending patients Italy Next fucking level compared Navarro. I'm sorry hear that. brother also Covid 4 months ago gone hospital. got without going, still regrets going hospital. still suffering lot fears permanent damage could've avoided went hospital. regret taking him. easy dismiss someone phone, get hospital! Drive ER. wont take her, go next. YEP.. fearful fearful lives family members children.

I 5 months pregnant teacher scared. Even make whole pregnancy without getting infected also worry happen go back maternity leave. Would expose young infant without fully developed immune system? many questions.

Scuurrred. someone living country local transmission covid-19 month (Thailand), someone lived Minnesota 8 years, heartbreaking see happening country truly love. understand hard eat hands, wear mask observe social distancing. that's takes keep epidemic check. Good article. issue opening schools- opening schools absolutely plan.

This looking repeat lockdown reopenings. White House put somewhat reasonable reopening plan- proceeded absolutely ignore it. 

There's barely month schools supposed reopen.  going solid national guidelines implemented then?  going tell every state slap something together couple weeks? That's sickest. got worst it, vertigo weird electrical buzzing head moved around made dizzy second two. happened every time moved, sucked. Think you‚Äôre eating shitty ‚Äúenchiladas‚Äù pharma companies businesses? know businesses do? Profit. fail. may, still change young people primary drivers pandemic spreading thus far. ""reversed"" really read COVID instruction manual. again, nobody ever reads manual... hot, also unusually bad influenza. remember vaccine ""wrong"" year, lot people got REALLY sick. colleague 50ies gone 6 weeks, feel well months after.

Women supposed handle virus much better men, eases distress, all.  


Stay well safe. Even though cautious comes virus hoping way could level pro sports partly people's mental health home wanting something watch.

I reasoned players outside might dangerous activities. thinking much time players would indoors around like locker rooms such. really reasonable. hoping way could make work. :/ probably bad idea. Spot science based reopen not? Looks like running room Bring one island shall want pony. also age group likely work service/in-person industries would first asked back employers. Like said, good top-level data young people wearing masks/not social distancing worse age groups, higher asymptomatic prevalence young people + service sector re-opening align reasonably data. Except say time. downplayed necessity masks hospitals could them, rather truthful leveling people shortage, really need wear masks available. state running 20% positive day day.  want number increase?!?  Politicians making health decisions! hm, countries like US Sweden take route? Tsss heh!   Standing public street wonder case breakdowns North, Central, South Florida Can't handle regional Arizona communities  Put people television. Put billboards. Put radio. Put front ignorant fucks everywhere. Death cult. simple. already pay lol us lost high paying jobs fuuuuucked Yeah idk, like I'm sure reasons, would like explained official journalist kind expert. 

And maybe profits, would explain explain it. I'm hoping something innocent. Lowe's employee here. will, too. everything administration ridiculous. house senate blame well. ‚Äòthe bigger lie, people believe it‚Äô governments M.O. apparently.  never said didn't, well. yes, are. can't even find time fix little issues store, fact side building almost always 80 degrees. freezer broken almost month. Dollar tree care training new managers, care even slightly regular associates, list goes on. STOP KILLING CITIZENS!!!!

Being American fucking embarrassing. calm intubated last words spoke him, Ms. Garcia said.  Ms. Garcia, sick Covid herself, weathered deaths alone, husband young daughter quarantined elsewhere. 

I mess part :'( Best tell remdesivir research spearheaded US. that's one thing thought top head.

That US research seems like ""hurr durr America sucks"" narrative.   Insert Thug Life photoshop meme.  using Worldoneter since January check stats. Rarely see anything wrong. Thiel company Palantir bid contract this. good news except bottom line. straight cronyism honestly unexpected grifters. senate majority leader answered explaining support giving people paid sick leave pandemic. ""It would set bad prescient"".

The rich powerful built fortunes exploiting working people. course want give tiny amount profit common good.

It threatened total collapse money machine suddenly ok considering stuff claimed impossible decades. Oh yes forgot 3.15-7.35 hr great money pays bills. Smh üñïthe wait staff wants that. think people careful they‚Äôve seen bad gets. Unfortunately NY MI growing everyone else getting back 1000 cases day range suggesting don‚Äôt much immunity yet either some, certainly case. Here's excerpt news article.

""Video footage taken Mississauga, Ont., T&amp;T Supermarket uploaded Tuesday shows angry shopper refusing wear mask, per store‚Äôs policy, telling store clerk benefit masks ‚Äúa communist, socialist lie.‚Äù ""

Here's link news article case want verify it.  Asshole really intrigued Germany statistics whole country. western Europe. I‚Äôm American, I‚Äôm curious government trying force masks people opposed private business would hold court. Georgia's latest numbers governor right. cases spiking deaths followed yet. good! Measles ever reach herd immunity? (Clue:nope) It‚Äôs really sad public safety stuff like NEWS it‚Äôs really common sense keep everyone safer. America right joke. would deleted? overwhelming collapsing healthcare system. government could give shit die not. happen. best, it'll make news cycle, people go back snapchat filters. Nah like whole fucking landfill fire, firefighters playing fortnite eating lunchables workers landfill chasing butterflies. Sounds like Brazil. way president refusing lockdown. didnt Teeter also say enforce local mask mandates? July 20th, back ordered. 9.99 CDN FYI go Trader Joes without mask 'aren't allowed' say anything you. know 2 teens w/o masks asked checking out. also told 'allowed' touch bags go outside pack purchases myself, ok wear mask

Does make sense Also anti vaxxers infest Facebook dangerous anti maskers much likes France, Germany, Great Britain whatever democratic Asian country want pick putting federal coffers COVID-19 research? either totals per capita like. vaccine could approved October. near certainty approved distributed end school year. people sick enough hospitalized going sign trials. go hospital small tx town recently. gotten news hospital filling crazy deaths, refrigerated truck outside hospital covered makeshift path see loaded. That's point. use viruses say specifc one do. kill, don't. profit, sure. bother, type people think government needs print money. Texas. health insurance spend last $325 test get cleared job interview. likely permanent lung mental damage. 

And sure go ahead say ‚Äúnu uh‚Äù  employees fucked. I‚Äôm sad them. best fucking idea I've heard today. know, used feel like that. I've taken seriously, got prepared, made sure we're inside property much possible. kept hearing 'wait two weeks' beginning think might ok here. Lately, state government started lining refrigerated trucks, I'm pretty sure deliver fresh flowers ill well-wishers. Anyone want comment previous hard hit areas - eg michigan, NY ?

It looks like enough population enough exposure infer that‚Äôs bad gets (no second surge) classic. Sort like captain titanic suing lifeboat captains water pours in. mask prevent breathing toxins. Making one toxins makes sense.

I believe point better breathing Covid. New York testing capacity right first wave deaths coming... Pretty ironic comment, ""I wonder they'll learn censorship work"" deleted mods. pretty sad face pandemic, still put company profit lives.

The data public. Period. Ok mean going away. Politics little virus spread.

 What's plan?

Hop train remote learning privatizing public education corporate hands google classroom video conference providers? I'm Ecuador. Guayaquil frightened us enough extra careful. wearing off...we careless every day.  Utah young gullible.  Yep, I‚Äôm Augusta 2 hours Macon, tells Augusta must completely full too. rub hard, though! fellow Georgian current student alumni university, DONT claim get this, take years really know sure many factors involved Fewer people died today yesterday cheapest gas station near full service. wonder people go one across street money costs more. (I‚Äôm MA) Unfortunately long standing law policy built complacency federal government aids crisis 1980s Actually statistically likely live matter age. Yet they‚Äôll believe things absolutely proof employees wear them, didn't?

And DT corporate incompetent...? economic ripple effects likely last 2022. It‚Äôs also likely mask wearing precautionary measure, especially winter months, commonplace. think social distancing first thing go away vaccine widely available, though. People social nature big gatherings back soon they‚Äôre reasonably safe. Unfortunately, we‚Äôre seeing current surge places never really went away begin with... Customers refusing wear mask actually killed security guard enforcing store policy Michigan. sad. UAE, cinemas places worship open awhile haven‚Äôt sort spike instead great downward trend active cases. overtook Sweden deaths. Already gone way past two days. Reddit - nothing anyone's responsibility. Even raising protecting children someone else's problem, apparently. Oh absolutely. BLM protests/riots/looting definitively referendum Trump general big violent pressure cooker situation.

And pressure cooker building again. it‚Äôs probably going singular, semi-non Covid related event set again. Frankly, Putin says didn‚Äôt believe point. Masks actually protect virus. says box. Freaking months ago? Im glad longer student. think need go digital field. Given often (and extent) weekly deaths exceed presumed baseline years, maybe reconsider definition ‚Äúexcess deaths‚Äù Busy what? important tested? words. accept fact government thinks fucking moron. lying good. tells lied you, swallow bullshit explanation whole too. stay home. stay scared. stay stupid. anti-maskers black lives matter going realize team. Neither one breathe. stupid article precisely attitude that's root problem.

One's personal experience necessarily representative.

The lack imagination consider something outside direct, personal experience fueling pandemic.

[Edit: clear, intend excoriate you, apologize saying earlier. general observation humanity point time.] Replace Federal Government US Treasury you‚Äôd better analogy. somebody gonna tell him? Yeah get you‚Äôre saying. Hopefully trends continue ease y‚Äôall. hopefully rest country learns rub two brain cells together soon stats, five 59 people passed away age 40 younger, none underlying health conditions. Trump literally anti-christ  I'm 30lb since November (thanks slow weight loss, stubborn body) ... good thing another 60lb til BMI 34.9 - plague over... \*sigh\* Christ thick making reference old Nationwide ad. punch line get auto insurance ""Life Comes Fast."" assume that's also OP referring to. Unfortunately retailers probably viewed competitive disadvantage.  required masks Walmart (or retailers) not, would lose bunch business.  I'm certainly Walmart fan, Walmart nationwide big deal.  help normalize mask wearing. Absolutely this. accident work, totally fault. stupid. involved table saw, Osha.

$70,000 fine wanted. literally go Osha office demand punish boss stupidity. Cut fine $5k. months later vinyl guy cut finger deep, needed stitches.

Osha got $70,000 one.

From small business dozen employees.

If working unsafe conditions, call them. long huge corporation they'll quickly show up. expect anything take money end. think month ago, Pence saying media ringing ‚Äúalarm bells‚Äù six states increase 1,000. went say ‚Äúwinning fight invisible enemy.‚Äù winning, would hate see it‚Äôs like lose. winning. way ahead 2nd place. whole china conspiracy ist stupid anyways. China might lie not. might responsible fault pandemic not. matter now. pandemic exist every country deal it. 

How gonna help situation US somehow proven China lies virus? Even sparsely populated states like Montana seeing rapid growth cases. New cases Montana higher Ohio, per capita, growing R(t)=1.35. troubling.  looks like right published Trump Administration Strips CDC Control Coronavirus Data country really never shut down, different states different lockdown procedures. majority states Northeast shut part getting back normal (eating out, gyms, back work). open protesters really much anything, places like Detroit larger, majority really really organization. 

We also utter failure public health response confused shit load people gave ammo anti-vaccine &amp; mask crowd. first told top experts CDC masks needed, go cruises, substantial threat US. Fine, refuse put shoes, wear hands instead bludgeon grandma death them. post upvotes petition signatures even question..... fact many get covid, go along lives convinced right along. they'll smarmy too. Based what? fundamental property covid causes growth chart see R0 SARS-COV-2 around 3.

You can't application current heavy restrictions celebrate herd immunity reached. start fining corona infecting people, stop stop talking record breaking? We're achieving new top land speed making world's largest crepe. sick, dying, dead people. best ‚Äúcure‚Äù virus get first place, hence vaccines. You‚Äôre thinking better treatments place cure, happening. like disillusion legit cause hurting others.

Good job ignoring country &lt;30k cases talking messed country hitting 4million.

Guess one mass mask usage? Hmmm. Theyve averaged 3 deaths per day last week data dump anything also know long-term effects, yet.

Even kids ""lucky"" enough mild cases might end life-long life-shortening medical problems.

(And love username! üò∏) bad it‚Äôs airborne go public facing workers highest risk catching it, healthcare workers. hold greater risk complications general public, huge source spread, necessary keep America running, often position afford illness.

That's going vaccinate ton black latino workers default inequity US. beneficial once, great, though still larger problem overall. ones significant risk. get it, rather famous rich people may minorities afford self isolate. position capable keeping catching it, priority. Trump directed reporting sent Whitehouse instead CDC. 

Expect 0 cases within week. plan blame Joe Biden. like 2009 republicans decided 2008 recession Obamas fault. real I‚Äôm pretty well paid put shut Almost one wears masks Sweden, try keep several meters away people possible though. understand can't agree slowly reopen schools see goes? NJ getting uptick cases here. district going full open approach though parents' survey resulted parents wanted hybrid schedule. husband works another district hybrid schedule, today football team field huddled up. know. see schools staying open long all. Guess time tell though. opting keep daughter home year sucks, options. fully understand everyone does. Dumbasses gonna try paint stuff shower year. ""re-opening"" happened summer break, mean anything June/July/August (no classes happen regardless). fall schools open in-school classes (probably high schools), (more common universities). seems dumb. Like others said going wear thing complaining get benefits make stupid point? drag much longer places Fuck  dEy wAnT ComPlY!! CoNsPiRaCy!!




/s death rate shows huge drop since April

I would wait couple weeks taking comfort that. Teachers catch *everything* going around. used joke call kids ""disease vectors."" also: die, didn‚Äôt want save? hate God save argument reason, too.

Mission Accomplished!üëç!

Congration. Yer done et. Oh. leaving? homework assignment??? Right-O then. There's actually boatload scientific evidence now, showing work. There's way could actually looked body research currently exists, came conclusion. would cite numerous recent articles prove masks fact save lives, know read them.

Edit: people Exactly. Look much 9/11 televised. virus caused visceral reaction us yet. thats really key, reasonable men retract opinions turn mistaken.  Forget tv crews, put police lapel cams nurses doctors aides.

Picture quality would suck, least it‚Äôs real footage real people. friends casual social contact - three I‚Äôve talked depth (over zoom they‚Äôre pissed won‚Äôt hang out) never around severely sick/dying people hospital. frame reference awful dealing disease like be.

The simpler explanation Trump's small-minded narcissist initially thought Corona drummed attack deep admit wrong. meanwhile adult focused new rides Disneyworld lmfao. Yes, welcome new age.

I appreciate comment little snowflake ;-) money. Ha, that‚Äôs true. He‚Äôs elected actively make things worse, that‚Äôs considered competent standard expect folks like him. randomly picked 100 people Texas, Georgia, Arizona, Florida, etc, least 20 would say it‚Äôs hoax. may wanna invest muzzle prevent spewing utter bullshit.

Shit guys contact tracing? guess point get infection rate contact tracing would useful though. nation almost-vets. Trumps Gorkas place.

Lol. even war veterans...most living vets nothing mercenaries sent fight wars maintain global dominance...not ensure freedoms. *sad yeehaw noises* going happen. better chance hoping entire administration gets infected maybe the'll get shit together. bare minimum thing want point states infection rate control ban flights travel hotzone enforced self quarantine. 2nd wave could occuring Catalonia. seen spikes cases remind us first spikes March April. regional government already begun taking measures specific areas, asked us stay home costs. We're still actively learning virus practically scientists researchers dramatically changed views new information.

It reasonable downplay virus previously Fauci worked administrations active prepared anti pandemic teams detailed plans containment etc probably difficult Fauci learn stuff destroyed present folks. here. declared ""essential first responder."" hazard pay anything. hours never changed shutdowns started, still haven't. offered even hours. think Florida way way worse NY, waiting way long pump breaks. girl's original offence biting mum's finger.

Meanwhile, Amber Heard walking free.

Now you. go. turn. return with- oh, IDK- ""it's mum's fault filing charges""

And I'll come back ""the police authority charge, mum *blah-blah-blah-blah...""*

Don‚Äôt worry. They‚Äôre coming excuses numbers wrong.

In summary, thank God I'm Australian (even though Victoria currently pariah Aus...) way get companies take covid protections seriously sue them. think supermarkets go around putting signs warning slippery surface? supermarkets worried getting sued someone slipped fell. 

Start suing companies protecting covid. way change corporate behavior. really think lot people think virus virus act basically same. rest us learning untrue actually is.  ironic all. kind person refuses wear mask kind person also social distance, wash hands frequently, use hands sanitizer.  reported incivility like me. comment need go see psychiatrist mental health expert ASAP insulting post. attempting invalidate insult disregard opinion words. rage would misplaced. Yes, insurance companies take profit, they're reason see posts someone's hospital stay drug costs hitting mortgage price levels. fact, would probably quite pleased healthcare costs reasonable. better hurry. Trump would allow this, he‚Äôll gone soon. definitely get rid that. gotta creative. Imagine seeing product online that's basically sign face says ""I'm selfish asshole"" thinking take money! aren‚Äôt getting it. relationship number cases number deaths. isn‚Äôt always direct relationship. I'm not, family is. Part eating family ""hangs out"" without anyone put work. hung one person's place, that's suddenly one person feed 10 people point.

Another part tired cooking crave things never even knew make begin with. Like love sushi. used eat 2-3 times month, idea begin making it. I‚Äôm sorry expecting people understand they‚Äôre talking offensive you. 

Personally, don‚Äôt see option. don‚Äôt correct people, ever learn? Honestly, compared Florida beaches; glacier national park seems like pretty easy place keep distance. I‚Äôd pretty surprised really became issue. Yeah, that, too. actually serious?

Yes. formula calculate proportion population needs immune herd immunity follows:

1 - (1/r)

If R 2.5 need 60% population antibodies herd immunity.

If R 7, need 86% population antibodies herd immunity.

But R 1.15, need 13% population antibodies achieve herd immunity.

In UK, we've suppressed R 1 working home plus social distancing, masks improved public hygiene. % antibodies places like London 20%. 

So, herd immunity. goes New York City, goes Northern Italy, goes Sweden. CDC others days symptoms days since symptoms first appeared


Notice meet three criteria. totally explains increase deaths icu admissions /s Need Snickers? Wouldnt second best time 9.99 years ago? it'll definitely freak out.

I shithole country Going take longer implement Oracle find vaccine. Awful. Half Dade can't even brush teeth right. I'm skeptical. sounds like talking masks... yes.. no... yes.. blame rise cases (in days) testing.

I not, guess agree number active infections increasing dramatically.

The number positive tests hand scale significantly tests performed. pointed out.

If 5% population infected, 100 random tests would show 5 positives. 1M random tests would show 50K positives.

(When test people symptoms, ratio positive vs. negative tests pushed up.)

A better argument would be: number tests performed increasing linear fashion (more less), number positive tests grows exponentially. true sad state Divided States America.

This basically science intellectual population vs anti-science deplorables. explained pretty clearly well Also US, 400 healthcare professionals alone died? average 6 years schooling 2,400 years schooling. blows mind. 

I think often numbers, town live 40,000 people. 

It tragic people treating dead like ""oh well going die anyway"".

There smallish difference USA data media reports number cases deaths (e.g. CNN which, think relies CDC databases) posted worldometer.com. latter appears update slightly quicker also explicitly lays case numbers military, veterans affairs, federal prisons, Navajo Nation, repatriated folks cruises/Wuhan, plus Guam Puerto Rico, Marianas Islands, Virgin islands.These areas 2,600 deaths seems typical running difference number reported. anyone know whether numbers generally reported media include states? main reason difference? shit. fucking pandemic.

It's right. Hey, me, dad. Remember me? forget write taught play basketball! incorrect. Florida reports resident non resident deaths like states do.

The disagreement former web site maintainer state non resident deaths. antibody tests combined swab tests. 

At least get facts right ffs. Well you‚Äôre going correct also make sure know opening schools affects students parents also faculty staff families. mention, we‚Äôre fire, don‚Äôt focus virus fact infected shed virus 2-3 days prior symptoms (during timeframe highest rate) spreads air units indoor spaces. So, time cases discovered school system multiple school systems community get ready it‚Äôs going get ugly.....

I‚Äôm sorry, whole situation politicism enveloped pisses off. helps all, there's developing theory immuno-compromised patients may better outcomes (or least less mortality) due less chance cytokine storm (i.e., immune system overreaction) occurring. Cytokine storms hard manage easily fatal.

He's likely get it, (in theory) busted immune system less likely catch fire. Franklin Veaux put well.

""How disease 1% mortality shut United States?""

There two problems question.

1.	‚Å†It neglects law large numbers; and

2. assumes one two things happen: die you‚Äôre 100% fine.

.

The US population 328,200,000. one percent population dies, that‚Äôs 3,282,000 people dead.

Three million people dead would monkey wrench economy matter what. doubles number annual deaths once.

.

The second bit people keep talking deaths. Deaths, deaths, deaths. one percent die! one percent! One small number! big deal, right?

.

What people survive?

For every one person dies:

19 require hospitalization.

18 permanent heart damage rest lives.

10 permanent lung damage.

3 strokes.

2 neurological damage leads chronic weakness loss coordination.

2 neurological damage leads loss cognitive function.

.

So sudden, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs 1% fatal!‚Äù becomes:

3,282,000 people dead.

62,358,000 hospitalized.

59,076,000 people permanent heart damage.

32,820,000 people permanent lung damage.

9,846,000 people strokes.

6,564,000 people muscle weakness.

6,564,000 people loss cognitive function.

.

That's thing folks keep going ‚Äúonly 1% dead, what‚Äôs big deal?‚Äù don‚Äôt get.

.

The choice ‚Äúruin economy save 1%.‚Äù reopen economy, destroyed anyway. US economy cannot survive everyone getting COVID-19.  right, New south wales. see actual study, summary. known better.

""In study New South Wales, nine infected students nine staff across 15 schools exposed total 735 students 128 staff COVID-19. two secondary infections resulted, one transmitted adult  Plus goal young people sex. That's pretty disastrous pandemic. can't stand black man woman charge. States' rights states' whites. It‚Äôs great governor banned local laws masks then. /s make claim ""droplets may stay air"". test sarscov2 droplets. used generic droplets. tiny particles enough viral load even infectious dose? 

There's lot ifs speculation. 

Even study long sarscov2 lasts surfaces ""assisted"". used solution designed keep viruses alive. tested amount virus found, amount needed cause infection. 

These click bait science articles. He‚Äôs going make killing... petition, legally binding document. Anyway, see defending right government protects public health. it‚Äôs either ‚Äúrecord high coronavirus cases today‚Äù ‚Äúlarge number cases exposed unreported‚Äù. Choose headline. I'm trying wrap head deaths low are, realize could lagging.

Is possible March, TONS cases realize NY? positive test rates 50% times March, maybe deaths high daily cases actually much higher now. Positive test rates reached 20%+ certain places, never high 50% like NY. Americans coming conclusion pandemic response don‚Äôt like Americans?  seeds Trump, Trump elected alarming edge month

But since Jan 1, Congress taken [40 days recess, business usual even though we're middle worst tragedy since Spanish Flu. They're expected take Aug. 10-Sep. 7 off. People dying everywhere, industries, big small businesses collapsing, millions unemployed otherwise bankrupt. Congress taking recesses. care labor laws behind Congress are; that's atrocious. states, absolutely illegal deny medical care based residency (as be). 


Sick people victims failed government need care. pumping false positives  Wait ghetto federally funded 4 billion dollar giant first rest follow. 

GOTCHA really want know? going pretty. 

The Republican Party taken stance made mind. decided anti-intellectual party long time ago. such, pandemic really starting take off, go response deny misdirect. 

There course, true believers really think virus big deal, hoax. people genuinely think acting way policies seal vote them. in, pandering base downplaying virus acting like big deal. ""bucking"" science, ""sticking it"" Liberals. 

This tactic incredibly effective turns virus big deal, think ***hope*** start this. think banking fact virus going take off. going similar Swine Flu, H1N1 virus outbreaks years past. 

Now looking like stay, what's worse, attack truth made things even deadly rest Americans. 

Now Republican Party ***cannot*** admit wrong. feel like would major disaster party, would 100% right. decided best option try hide downplay what's happening hopes people notice. 

But course going notice, trick lie muddy waters much possible. way least ***some chance*** coming pandemic party intact. 

The Republican Party willing kill thousands citizens save face try maintain power US, rather admit wrong, set crafting policy save lies. 

The ultimate irony would done first place, would ***MUCH*** better stance politically now. Imagine Trump came Day 1, pointed Dr. Fauci said important figure topic, going let Fauci take control direction response pandemic. going adhere advice counsel others crafting policy legislation pandemic. 

It would easy political win Trump also saved lives.

This voting important. want competent administrators highest levels government. 

We still chance fix OK first went big rant actual flaw system. UI never pays 100%. fact paid 100%+ flaw. People capped 100% fully support like said, fault own.

Then criticized mad people made more, means read post.

Then talk fantasy literally never going happen US lifetimes. I'm debating merits it, matter-of-factly talk hop, skip jump away. Like ""oh, x, x x. TOTALLY DOABLE."" seem equating ""can"" ""want to"" ""will"", not.

I think I'm caught up. Think harder. wait watch it. happening right now. upcoming revolt televised. mean gonna sanitize bookstore  visual made scene peaceful. Butterflies nice touch. Thank you. better yet. long Trump says take stores continue require masks? Yeah, rubber-stamped lot papers grad students post-docs PI. Many actually benchtop, animal, *and* clinical trials antimicrobial agents.

But appear viruses. advocate HCQ least past 13 years, general advocate trying antibiotics viral diseases.

I think one spent career focused coronaviruses drug development useful insights. world short useful insights possible reuse already approved drugs January. idea chance, failed, hopefully ideas get chance. world going insane. cases rising testing more? deaths down. think is?

this matters election year leftists desperate. media manufactured hysteria. 844 total recorded covid deaths, according CDC age bracket. where? Japan? 32 teams = 3 sick players per team.

55 man roster = 5% roster sick

NFL made rule sick player sit 3 games. tough play key players and/or large percent roster forced games. 5 count eat fine. Houston problem. HIV wildly different virus though Since isn‚Äôt capitalized target? accountability. Make like job- dont get paid unless stay inside. none practical people dishonest. Lolllllll-
Texan here. Get ready suck dead toes! know someone Spain 3 months, body won‚Äôt recover making antibodies guess. She‚Äôs like 33 ish diabetes since childhood. Pretty fucked up. I‚Äôve saying while, countries experienced SARS/MERS social antibodies. societies remembered previous infection able recognize threat mount effective response protect host due previous exposure. rest us much. 24 agree. I‚Äôve gone twice see best friend since March. outside entire time opposite sides fire. dad going Home Depot everyday, going work, took flight pick new puppy. ones showing positives? Besides tragedy, it‚Äôs gonna expensive follow-up time US. Oh forgot, guys don‚Äôt health insurance! Well, guess that‚Äôs even worse then... looks like dont anyone working hospital family. Florida also state massive growth huge mobility. noticed hard hit states, matter politics, much less mobility. Good - people stupid. said, places like Iowa great back 100%. interesting see mobility indicates serious people region take threat (if stay home more, probably wear mask go don‚Äôt go indoor restaurants/gyms?) Jesus that's horrible 72 grand total people since started testing done already already is, signs massive underreporting due obvious corruption lack kits work someone whose one year old contacted virus sick two weeks entire family contacted virus including parents grandparents. scary situation children get virus spread virus. would many cases day cares. 

If teacher contracts COVID school required use sick leave? considered worker's compensation? teacher sent home 14 days due positive case classroom teacher use sick leave? teacher comes back quarantine two days later another student tests positive forcing class another 14 day quarantine teacher sick leave left teacher sitting home unpaid status? month later another student tests positive sending entire classroom another quarantine still paid leave teacher? 

Who pays tests? ensures testing done? long test results come back? 

What happens entire cafeteria work force school put quarantine? feed school? 

Who clean school 14 days longer janitors gets sick put quarantine? paid sick leave worker's compensation? 

Same questions bus drivers.......

Same questions principal vice principals put quarantine manage schools principals secretaries sick quarantine two weeks time since many work closely together? 

What working parents every time child sent home two week quarantine positive rest? 
So many parents pressing hard schools reopen due work yet plan place? Wouldn‚Äôt legal battle protestors would win case 24 hours less ..

People need realize condoning allowing protests choice ... big stop local police departments .

In NY way cops could stop massive ones without heavy force , violence , national guard .

Same thing goes reversing situation . every single store decides ignore orders staying closed cops wouldn‚Äôt able anything r/collapse hell drug Couldn‚Äôt said better myself! load double standard bullshit. want political though? Since politics driving insane unchecked outbreaks? like Trump admin listening advice anymore anyways. Seems like move would start openly criticizing Trump, gets fired go work Dem house Biden campaign. Yeah, stockholmers usual seem staying city summer. Anecdotally, people know taking less vacation time years order save weeks winter/next summer traveling easier again. swear every time hear full name chuckle. ""chimpanzee"" mean context? elaborate? kind annoying pretty well telegraphed election wasn‚Äôt going fair: voter registration purges prior election guy running election also charge running even though that‚Äôs never happened before. People screaming months advance verify still registered register early compensate. 

It‚Äôs alarming story shared wish done earlier. might susceptible autumn, might worse second time around due ADE. It‚Äôs sars1 vaccine didn‚Äôt work. may set majority population worse outcomes exposure second wave. ‚Äúthe biggest crash since Great Depression‚Äù happen. always bigger cuz economy always expanding always farther fall. I'm actually really surprised supply chain food necessities still holding up. rate spread south continues, there's way eventually affected significantly. lie? give us best analysis given little information had? I‚Äôm sure answer somewhere between, I‚Äôm genuinely asking. Netflix show called Lenox Hill released episode covering hospital New York dealing Covid-19. Sorry guys, could point Fauci made difference?
I know great guy, but... many stores boycott. Amazon going field day. Please research first don‚Äôt buy stocks based internet stranger‚Äôs comment.

AstraZeneca British-Swedish company. good track record 3 years stock price keeps climbing. it‚Äôs US company alternative (Moderna) much likely spike stock prices positive news due US company. That's umbrella's cabanas :-) Lol...experts know progress. Fauci warned pandemic 2017 mattered, played down. contact tracing supposed effective testing unreliable? I‚Äôve personally seen multiple examples spouses ran concurrent identical symptoms other, went testing, obviously continuous constant close contact throughout symptoms, one tests positive negative.

I understand false negative likely error, types testing issues, especially second test household confirming least one positive diagnosis, we‚Äôre turning people may infected back general population likely assume official confirmation COVID, many cases likely it. since beginning. 100k days getting close access numbers point 2 new clusters imported cases topic also fudge death numbers. Like assigning covid death person old another issue. Nah died ‚Äúsuffocation‚Äù covid. Interesting. Listing case numbers connections others. trump like ‚Äú gone Easter ‚Äú didn‚Äôt say 2020, 2021 year technically wrong . Banning protests gauranteed way encourage protests/riots. Please tell joke 2300 according evident countries younger children really spread virus, especially elementary schools fine.

However, knowledge time Sweden still irresponsible fuck. decided call ""spread love"" program. Lung damage ameliorate time. Wait hold on.

I'm Germany every official building that's frequented people (supermarkets, drugstores, banks, offices...) perspex shileds installed MONTHS ago (I first witnessed March went pharmacy pick something up) propect people working there.

WTF going there?! appear bad. checked count number confirmed cases Spain 259k death count 28,416. 
I'm U.S. overall count 13,516 251 deaths (and OR's population 2019 4.218 million). numbers really anything alarming. someone use make incredibly boring drive Detroit Toronto work every weeks, hope border status closed long time. miss drive one bit. point US simply cannot it. full shutdown requires unity support government. Who? How? comments annoying. It‚Äôs serious accusation zero evidence. sounds like it‚Äôs really insightful it‚Äôs actually totally vacuous. young people. mid thirties see many people well 50+ social distancing following mask requirements. people exposed covid, die it. Unless they're already dead. 

You get gold star. best troll all. start now, ca. 3.5 million Americans infected. 
Withing 30 days, ca. 2.5 3 million more. (80.000 new cases per day) 60 days could 12 even much infected. 
My guess November roughly 30 - 40 million even infected Americans. 
If death rate stays around 5%, something around 1.5 2 million deaths best unknown number invalids. 
But numbers without proportional increase, guess someone good math. 
  
That look good.

Than military. Social distancing running ship seems contradict itself. soldiers barracks? 
How long take, till military longer able operate?

Yes, Trump literally destroying nation. 
He changed MAGA DA (Destroy America) ""Conservatives"" simply ""death cultist"" 
If Trump get reelected nothing changes, could expect 10 20 million deaths less everyone get infected. 

No, absolutely good! Tory government consistently starved NHS last 10 years Lindsey graham. sub literally told ‚Äú2 weeks‚Äù cases start going state (in northeast) since early June. haven‚Äôt. feel like makes people almost disappointed. It‚Äôs pathetic disgusting many view cases deaths way feel validated. people use VPN connect networks outside China.

Extinction level? No.

You can‚Äôt call things truth. Thanks, 2 months then. It‚Äôs country. want. like, saying men pigs still kind bullshit no? remember month two ago comments removed criticizing Trump sub political. I'm happy see sub come around fact criticizing Trump political attack, he's huge part problem huge part Americans failure deal virus able discuss failrues ridiculous. literally premise flatten curve. yet people thought risk moment lockdown lifted, risk always going remain massive hospital surge. Hey real talk, on, hospitals must send data White House CDC, know actual numbers cases going forward? Well won‚Äôt go away (anymore). many countries failed initial responses, actually... almost except handful. contain world would agree total lockdown like month, completely unrealistic. still people talk bs apparently forgot ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù. European countries less successful approach, US 8/ totally fuckng right now. Wonder see pictures body bags piling again. forget kids die INFECT EVERYONE ENCOUNTER. vaccines proven work, need prove safety durability.

The illness kills 0.7% people infects massive skew old significant health issues.

Not extinction level. whole ‚Äúwear mask‚Äù thing lie. It‚Äôs good ol‚Äô individualism actually failures government put people. deserve lockdown stay home without fear debt evictions. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs really going save us. ""We home Christmas, boys!"" common saying recruit soldiers World War 1. mean, would like Trump bad, Fauci less bad. saying odd angry Fauci Trump. Course bothers guys want absolve Trump responsibility. Same. coworker traveling every state husband. Another one flown Nevada, California, Washington. Delaware Maryland end June. I‚Äôm leaving house except work going WTF? It‚Äôs like people living different worlds... Yet Drump gutted Obama regulations would demanded hospitals prepared infectious outbreaks regards PPE... skewed less nursing homes imploding? crazy thing ask economist - ""could solve recessions simply giving people money?"" - never get negative answer. Usually conversation devolves gabbing legal, organizational sociological topics - never say 'no'. whole field embarrassed admit hundreds years studying issue recessions, answer straightforward ""just send people money"".

Luckily, economists bringing topic public discourse, including heavy-weights, well central banks seriously considering it. 11 years ago? distance, contagious.  really lowest end concerns, somewhat line covid-19. 1 good chance, social upheaval great. using mainstream sources. specific, could really start splitting hairs. Could talk sorts things could make gain ""Better"" features. feel gotten far topic.

So gather everyone know lets go protest lock downs still going people **had been** pretty good overall. use cell phone data fine/imprison A-holes protesting lock manslaughter. mildly amusing facts ignoring real consequences. ignorance kill innocent people around :(  would also highlight simple truth...we need them, REQUIRE us. Fuck em live. Lmao someone meme photo please incredibly demoralizing, particularly think how, executed actual shutdown, great deal suffering could avoided. We're held hostage leadership many fellow citizens. *You eat pieces shit breakfast?* Oxford's safety trials passed long time ago I'm extremely hopeful blows mind US many tens thousands deaths India billion people compared 300 million. 2 year old son check everyone's masks going out. get anxious even cry finds one us forgotten mask. problem kids, parents. sorry hear man.....sounds like ny Pretty much. said takes months deaths show up. assume lag point case reported.

I got COVID, knowing reality helped focus healing, things actually help me. Like drinking fluids, rest, etc. *not* drinking fucking cleaning supplies. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Guessing‚Äù = you‚Äôre either lazy look up, afraid facts might disagree dismissive narrative (they do).

Dismissing publication sensational without research *just bad* posting unfounded sensationalist articles (this isn‚Äôt).

The rates Florida whole *way* national current 7 day average 8.5%. controlled outbreak people exercising precautions closer 5%, Florida whole testing 18.8% positive, 33% positive rate group fucking wild. 

There issue, hasn‚Äôt handled well, article aimed (justifiably) bring light. dismissive attitude zero research perpetuates perception nothing done everything ok. It‚Äôs dangerous selfish fuck.

A modicum research internet-connected device typed weirdly motivated comment could informed you, prevented misinforming others.

Science isn‚Äôt political stance. Wear mask, wash hands, stay away people. Everywhere that‚Äôs done success.

And looked around America recently? We've decline decades we've put foot accelerator since then.

Our federal state governments literally owned massive corporations special interests. elected borderline mentally handicapped reality TV star president. fucking senate refused even investigate whether president committed treason! law enforcement agencies responded accusations violence, even violence. even get started climate change.

I mean fuck. I'm rich white dude highly specialized skill set strong STEM background, whatever, I'm set regardless.

But seriously, fuck everything that's happening country right now. far, people I've seen strongly advocate deep meaningful change, either young people, old people pandering young people.

You math.

Fauci narcissism: **GAG** oh fauci **Cough** *gag* you‚Äôre big. Uhh *slurp* wow, nice glasses Tony. Important thing know: artificial record. Bexar County, Texas cleared backlog today reported multiple days worth cases one day. real total around 72-73k. Still extremely scary number. #MAGA Dude, deaths longer declining.  suspected. Anything make look like things normal. That‚Äôs testing needs stop. need show one it. Duh. It‚Äôs easy. Stop stupid. Open school. Economy. Big. Best. USA.

You act gets make decisions didnt influenced political factors.

Were blind task force press conferences man basically explode incompetence spewing undoing everyone's work daily.

Every question answered fine line publicly disagreeing getting fired serving duty public health expert. Pretty fucked right? mention man 80.

On masks.... political issue since day one. Nobody. Even second. Questioned effectiveness.

No medical professional would ever stupid enough realize filter Respiratory disease would helpful containment. buffoon caused mass hysteria fucked forms ppe months. response fact happening globally? Hundreds governments banded together decide political agenda? Lmao say? Scientists proven people ate mask wearing generally lower cognitive function comply mask requirements.that said low cognitive functions means masks America really screwed. Well deals money science Honestly, thought it'd higher.   Shit already hit fan Brazil, don‚Äôt think population big enough catch US (the country earth that‚Äôs handled pandemic poorly Brazil).

India worth watching though cases still rising they‚Äôre country realistic chance overtaking US total deaths. It‚Äôs 1000 day. US 200,000 Covid deaths far 140,000


Google Excess Deaths CDC- Theres 60,000 excess deaths Covid related. look many excess deaths Florida Texas, Georgia R states due pneumonia. Florida smashing pneumonia records. It‚Äôs really govenors directing health agencies report Covid deaths universal healthcare. subsidies teachers. Orange dumb dumb didn‚Äôt take action except banning couple flights china. Said go away 5 cases instead learning wuhan leading example wearing masks. Condraticted doctors, fired health officials, threw away obamas pandemic response plan eventhough plans all, infered virus democratic haox even though ravaging world, oh stupid people instead waiting wane online classes homeschooling decides protests without masks spread virus further. think part got majority stupidity. want lockdown? that's get lockdown. said most, also you‚Äôre club states outside parallel universe.

And nothing value lost. I'm kinda thankful injury 18 left (totally minor life altering, thank god) disability. good lord 26 feel invincible. see people America use logic claim universal health care bad idea (i.e. might help people ""don't deserve it"").

IMHO, time running business like business pretty questionable. need work together pull this. need prioritize tests, albeit due failure control virus, there's shortage ramped testing need we're every going contact tracing. community lots covid tested two weeks weeks ago surely guarantee somewhat less likely. around 100s years scientists still dont know much it

Single person states qualify like 200/wk regular UI, regardless previously made. millions lose job fault income goes 1600/mo 800/mo tax. Talk fucking nose dive economy.

The added six make sure pretty much everybody would least enough keep paying basic needs. fact people shat upon most, minimum wage workers, actually got paid better flaw. people kept economy flat lining last months SPENDING many us, included, not.

Also, pissed system allows employer pay poverty wage making millions/billions/trillions also providing proper healthcare sick time/paid leave.

Stop bitching poor schmuck worked 8/hr local diner washing dishes that's receiving more. 

All aside -- 2k monthly UBI everyone totally doable proper taxation wealthy wealthy corps - flat tax way get paying kind proper- would fact generate jobs, income growth overall.

What's sadder seeing rise deaths. weeks ago handful people like ""oh there's 200-300 COVID deaths day U.S, bad"". Well seems we're seeing anywhere 800-1000 deaths day country. far there's 900 today. Sad. NO:¬†What done F:¬†You know, that‚Äôs almost unanswerable question. many possibilities. don‚Äôt like phrase context we‚Äôve done wrong, opposed let‚Äôs take look happened maybe lessons learned. never got baseline number reasons. Perhaps lack compliance people country kinds restrictions felt would appropriate. look European curve, came essentially baseline, different us. So, [they] stomped infection pretty well. started open again, wasn‚Äôt much infection around. look European countries, shut 90 95 percent country. Whereas shut down, calculation shut 50 percent. So, put factors together, can‚Äôt say anything wrong, know, certainly we‚Äôve got better.

Yeah exactly real talk. He's sugarcoating inaction Gov. basically says: europe locked hard got virus managable numbers. US half lock inefective. sure, Dr. Fauci, ""I can't say anything wrong"" Number deaths though... huge factor average Swede obese average American. mortality numbers likely higher US reason alone. ""Board members voted unanimously re-open""

....wot. Funny news outlets blamed original lockdown protests spreading virus though. Can‚Äôt ways. Bias?  I‚Äôm rooting anything, I‚Äôm looking numbers... SCIENCE LIE SCIENCEINDUSTRY someone explains testing =/= cases (NOT per capita), yes. [http://archive.is/mulmS](http://archive.is/mulmS) Actually, [trailing 7 day positive trending 5 days now, we're still well half April positive rate despite fact we're way lax testing today. Granted reported positives lag actual infections week so, comment tad alarmist compared story data telling. 

If claim true, would seen positive rate skyrocket, increase 5% 8.5%. Positive rates also plateaued TX, FL started downtrend AZ. see reason believe we're missing cases today 2 weeks ago.  also include hospitalizations. know numbers though. Goya 

Well played, sir! President Xi pls  government still recommend people stay home everyone travel, Scanian agree, one for, one.
F Denmark ofc.  impression report COVID-19 cause underlying condition illness all.

In Sweden, deaths COVID-19 diagnos counted. Fauci obviously done great work, incompetent regards Covid-19.

Just WHO, CDC, Trump admin others also incompetent give pass. pushing policies would put US path Taiwan, Vietnam, etc. people listened him. America strange nation.

The country shut down, protests streets open things again.

You armed militia streets, demanding opening up.

You people spitting health-workers trying save lives.

There tons examples people simply ignore whole disease party, without interference police government.

&amp;#x200B;

You strong anti-mask ""movement"", going way president himself.

And -a lot- people refusing listen science. is, people government, well streets.

What kind nation you? want? 


Perhaps start marching Washington soon, majority disagree things run? silence fact answer....  Yeah, I‚Äôm Russian, total toll 120 million atm, I‚Äôve buried 15 members family myself. yet seems people US want move like business usual mean everybody else Belgium already (and recovered) ? gavethese people power, continue so. remember decade ago small businesses complaining Walmart, big companies consolidated way wealth power. Reminds dystopian films private corporation runs world. That's New Zealand, we've living life effectively normally nearly 2 months completely normally month bit. Yeah, let's blame advisor president's incompetence. 

The amount stretching blame guy beautiful. assume Fauci's fault elected blithering idiot thinks people know Lincoln republican. care. aren‚Äôt really abandoning him, cutting losses. When/if Trump finally loses, probably go rebranding. prediction something exponential growth always big margin error

Mate, predictions far off, would make sense calculate margin *accuracy*.

We know approached correctly we've gotten side. countries could delaying inevitable, end many deaths, relatively speaking, Sweden. soon say. hospitals start spilling street say matter personal responsibility 100 year old grandma fault. Okay! I'm trying reach people perhaps understand situation is. much disinformation there. Even government Netherlands guilty spreading wrong information. example, beginning best discourage people buying medical masks, frequently claimed wearing masks public would help all. Obviously true, lot people still believe this, distrust government anything says. difficult situation. never seen better drug, might even call perfect drug time. leaflet best words, trust me, know words! Yeah, literally every person says nonsense you‚Äôre repeating links video. says masks arent 100% effective thing, regular people use them. 

Again, say don‚Äôt work also people hospitals need them? Rights duties come together part society. Someone explain them. like Sweden evenly populated. half population lives three biggest cities. feel like Fauci Trump exchange? Thanks civil, enlightened discourse. They‚Äôre like heavy duty paper towels used you‚Äôre working cars, generally. Don‚Äôt tear easily, really absorbent, packaged big rolls, used wipe apply harsh chemicals surfaces.

I‚Äôve ever seen colored light blue, helps find them. buy auto parts store, hardware store, see sold gas stations time USA Canada. This. He's one best field, head federal agency 36 years, received number impressive awards like Medal Freedom, Lasker Award Ernst Jung Prize, worked 6 different presidents.

He's chance promoted higher positions, refused continue involved agencies works. guy 79 could comfortably retired, instead continues work keeping us safe. Yeah, killing people increase death rates, surprise there. Give days. wear mine office take route. put I‚Äôm going business talk someone. Sanitizer sanitizer sanitizer lol feel teachers unions need step Watch numbers start slowly going even though individual state numbers go up. relatively low death toll can't believe many Americans going die end this. r/confusedboners Hes got degree BS. Preach Well, definitely 7.4 billion. Give take. total Horatio Caine moment.

YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH another power play. want show control, something absolutely not. Still don‚Äôt understand Fauci hailed ‚Äúnational hero‚Äù ever since made faces Trump‚Äôs dumb press conference. 

This guy played threat till declared COVID pandemic. irresponsible statement masks. 

I think USA find better public health experts, preferably 40s 50s. That's capitalist way, blame victims. I've always learned Health class kids need develop overtime. Part learning process. yet know 10 year olds take pandemic seriously people 25. lord. number 1 Yeah, was. balls job call people spreading pandemic ya know, politics.

This weirdly lazy thing say, since rest post fairly cogent...

June 2nd: ""Pictures, photos TV clips people much congregated, masks together, closely congregated boardwalk, beach, pool, continues concern me""

June 5th: [""The protests are] perfect set-up spread virus sense creating blips might turn 10th: [""Masks help, it‚Äôs masks plus physical separation, get congregations like saw demonstrations... example kinds things concerned get Zombies? think capitalism socialism are? also said mid April it‚Äôs fine hook random strangers tinder figure NEED store. wear mask, get place quick possible. time loitering, wander around. big deal.

Shouldn‚Äôt obvious bc don‚Äôt care. know week‚Äôs right-with talking point. motivations pure. get it. 

So Fauci‚Äôs ‚Äúone job‚Äù fucked badly making one statement (made prevent medics running essential article PPE onset pandemic) exactly? juggling responsibilities of: director, front-facing PR, policy liaison, tiptoe around toddler wants burn throw rallies Easter.... Ok. want blame him. Go get sucker! Surely one else responsibility leadership situation.... Koronavir brand name Japanese drug favipiravir/avifavir. There's fairly limited research efficacy COVID-19. get list contact information people?  need list notify exposed, required quarantine themselves. 

Of course, think hoax, many comply quarantine order. Shut fuck lol **She‚Äôs ugly ass duck. hope son recovers, son adult similar mindset dad, take responsibility accepting medical advice someone who's expert medical field. thought thing protests like lost job social distanced yet social activism ever seen towards end lockdown. die desert. give water got oasis. Murica like "" force drink unboiled polluted water. get stomachache "". used wash leg instead. ...... understand mean says 60 minutes interview think time people start marching Washington honest.

You killed keep $$$ afloat.

You lied to, ridiculed trying protect yourself, family health-workers frontline this, every day. 


I amazed people putting crap there. flopping

It called *novel* virus reason. Highest seven day average deaths since June 14th. Kudos healthcare professionals keeping relatively control compared case/death ratio April. lessened hospital stay (due age patient) must holding up. read stupid statement day, it‚Äôs dumber headline suggests! Tell ‚Äúmental depressions‚Äù children experiencing school. First all, currently reads 2.8

It's 1.74 week 27. Which, remember first-grade math, Second all, even slightly 2 would still abnormally high deviation average.

Euromomo defines excess. Take disagree. talking say can't nuanced discussion school openings. Fauci told people hook tinder like two months ago, lockdown mode.

You really wish people listened him? Writing book takes time seriously doubt Fauci want spend Trump over. He's smart man.  770 people tested positive today die. UBI socialism, bandage keep capitalism alive longer. That's make sense, work long term. mean take UBI offer it. got stuff buy leftist groups donate to. ""news"" channel USA owned Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch. stickly propaganda Trump. give fuck anyone himself. manipulate gun toting idiots country. Pure gaslighting. get *Breaks world record every day*

We ""better"" publicly called girlfriend ""a tantrum"" upset able see mom, scared global pandemic, need friend. That's cruel. partner. reading amazed federal government thought put much funding testing also included funding child care working parents. read second paragraph, realized discussing Canada US live thought article about, reality slapped back down. 

Of course federal government us, especially ramping reopen schools control pandemic. :( ' fault! ' One person tests 3-4 times clearance return work = 3-4 ""cases""? that's issue report # tests conducted # individuals tested 1st time, 2nd time, etc.?

To say 30,000 1st time positive results today plus 20,000 2nd test still positive plus 10,000 3rd test still positive total 60,000 ""cases"".

If that's really happening time. research seems indicate least states reporting cases new individuals. Yeah, two lie easily breathe. give claim 1% chance truthful. Europe, slovakia specific (which known best politicians, organization skills etc...) seeing going US astonishing. big difference see countries is, incompetent politicians fuck up, ashamed, US seems like go point, even leave reality go full mental... 6 months pandemic seeing gouvernor suing mayor using masks quite interesting. asian (south korean, taiwaneese, vietnamese, HKners, etc...) reading this, wonder opinion news like one, please let know. Good post. I‚Äôd like add science data anyone claiming side science (and accusing others anti-science), go examine data yourself.  Donnie loves high score matter - stay fuck home get tested better monday. also act 2 weeks highly infectious even feel better unless negative test.

Cant wait hear conspiracy one finally happens.  Omg sounds rough.. hang there.... :( Eg New York definitely hundreds thousands infections Mar 26, 784 deaths total time. sufficiently expanded testing cases would reflect much death rate would looked low. April 10 10k deaths. Haha. Wow. Nice logic there. ""Hey, facial coverings effective, tell them?"" ""What, no, they'll seek better ones."" absolute bullshit. Think many lives cost that's true, face covering effective they're saying now. 

How bout saying, ""Hey, need save medical professionals, makeshift masks still effective save thousands lives?"" Either way, say that, would saved thousands. Covid doesn‚Äôt care...  issue is, say people ""masks work please buy them.. need stockpile medical staff""

The outcome would quite predictably hoarding public PPE. reason public health experts theyve done studies show happens.

Even mentioning scarf works face covering admission PPE would work, public smart enough know would work better!

So sadly real option try calm people's fears time advice given safely. need prove anything. There's reason multiple presidents parties. work explains it. imo, he's see things work him, cares people despite getting flack individual one supporters. friend makes better man Gonna fun college reopens fall... 20-30 days find test results helping accurate numbers either. weeks higher expected mortality rate ray sunshine ""SEE FINE!""

Not even remotely accurate reading said. wearing PPE masks. people wearing masks made cloth. *could have* beginning, Fauci insisted necessary, trusting then. says saying running low PPE. might saying *now* later excuse for? don‚Äôt get it... you‚Äôre worried man COVID spreading it. pepper spray causing cough spit place? it, certainly could spread area anyone near could risk. days going handhold like little toddler. research actual story. issue many young people prior covid already YOLO state mind. already bleak future outlook concerning environmentally, financially, politically.

Be afraid communism.
Be afraid collapsing economy.
Be afraid terrorism.

..... afraid COVID.

Just afraid tell I'm answers get vote. comeback. close schools.  contagion level nothing like america's. higher death rate neighbors higher mortality rate America.  nothing take away positive news way.

Sweden blanket closing schools high school University. points contradictory say Sweden worse hit (higher per capita death count) less hard hit (lower levels contagion).

Many asymptomatic people tested part mitigation coming positive.

Logically, use mask, maybe clerks motive call 'unrule'

To me, looks like man child crying 'I want eat asparagus!' food house. do, it'll ""pneumonia"" Covid deaths also down. Mission Accomplished! say I'm wearing mask? wear one everyday protect others.

Watch video. late... Spanish Flu literally massacred millions 18-40 year olds. live stream twitch YouTube then? Churches still make money way 

If asking Covid occupancy particular, aware Florida one four states report Covid hospitalization data. state isn‚Äôt willing mandate masks let foot bill. tax dollars spent state taking correct steps prevent infection? Fucking DP awful human come. wants sacrifice older people, start himself...  warnings back December Trump decided continuously ignore it. Yes, much larger state ignoring expert opinion (and even still ignoring expert opinion) caused massive prolonged outbreak.

Other first world countries suffered similarly, want look Europe whole, policy changes reduced rate infection. no.. America governors like Georgia actively prohibiting mask bans?? 

We could done more. done more. government set policies place encourage people stay home/wear masks. didn‚Äôt that, we‚Äôre still anything really slow spread. 

It‚Äôs maddening really. question can, rate. logic applied everything COVID. Speak rates idiotic absolutes I'm Nashville. Keep shit here. effective necessary mean outcome best. consider outcome. 

For instance, even combustion engine 100% efficiency, driving deflated tires lead fuel expenditure less efficient engine.

We see Europe start open US still first wave. Well, guess one people investigating reaction did: Army‚Äôs $122 billion budget, meant unsupported adjustments 54 times spending authorized Congress. Typically, adjustments public budgets small fraction authorized spending. Skidmore thought Fitts made mistake. ‚ÄúMaybe meant $6.5 billion $6.5 trillion,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúSo found report sure enough $6.5 trillion.‚Äù

So, feel vindicated.

It clarified really $21 Trillion ""spent"" rather poor accounting compliance practices resulted great deal messy record keeping Department Defense. New York Times clarified here:  care charge, wear masks TIL get incarcerated homework USA. Sounds little excessive. huh, would never guessed -5c cold side. real life, that's would work out.

Look JAMA Pediatrics study 46 pediatric hospitals North America said risk critical illness COVID far less children seasonal flu,"" said. ""The science side here, encourage localities states simply follow science, open schools. It‚Äôs damaging children: lack reporting abuse; there‚Äôs mental depressions addressed; suicidal ideations addressed students school. schools extremely important, they‚Äôre essential, must reopen.""

So using context, it‚Äôs clear conclusion ‚Äúthe science stand way this‚Äù meaning believes science supporting President‚Äôs claim, disregarding science is.

I fell media trick look draw clear conclusion. people shouldn‚Äôt children. Smh School bus driver delivering lunches. information given driver really .. specific virus kills cells described ""hiv-like"" properties. Great, nearly enough.

Antibodies small part immune system it‚Äôs test it‚Äôs possible test. test T-cells parts immune response expensive research settings.

The current hypothesis think som immunity likely last long SARS (years). question whether neutralizing immunity (preventing spread) protection illness.

Because antibodies wane immunity lasts, fraction protection always going larger seroprevalence. Possibly much twice large settings (was estimate from
Stockholm). would mean 40% 20% seroprevalence - quite close herd immunity heterogeneous group.

None say support for-profit healthscare industry, can't make pay front. treat go E.R. Urgent Care regardless ability pay. bill fact. 

Also, cost appear reason, though, would explain numbers staying rising, hospital workers talking saying, never seen dead before. Going hospital expensive fuck general, people still go, even things really require hospitalization (for instance poor/have primary care provider insurance), chances numbers changed drastically people afraid getting covid. covid really bad overwhelming hospitals, numbers would went up, down. even makeshift overflow covid hospital set national guard early city, ended tearing soon lack patients. Welp, it‚Äôs caught now. FREEEEEEDUMBZ BABYYYYY Right politicians abuse testing much anyone. leaders?????? wrong Americans????? basically focus one thing want dismiss everything else said done.

You colors showing. Unfortunately people find hard step back see forest trees. Despite votes completely right.

The people voting believe affirmative action racist. Fauci. want divert masks medical professionals, told people wear masks. 
 conclude moron math idiot. go willing wear mask. Don‚Äôt worry. people don‚Äôt think plot Bill Gates track them, fine. White person here, half thought well. Sounded like Guinea pig shit.  angle keep stoking race fires taking place US. Serious autism think new one fake positive cases. Know someone knows someone asked test came back positive without taking test kind stories wife got new house, need someone come walk house. precautions need take wearing mask? Unless never leaves. üò® South active cases highest daily incidence. anywhere else world. hate good news flair even exists sub. use completely arbitrary often used controversial, condescending, weird ways. Let reader decide themselves. long sarcastic apologies, guess I'm good then.

I can't say know went through, I'm going disrespect saying understand all. said, blaming gender something individual helpful anyone. would blaming race be, sexual orientation. Try 5 months Testing continues go 5 consecutive days least 700K tests yesterday 830K. yes, accounts rise course all. I've charting % positives 7 day moving average may peaked last Sunday 9.1% (nationally). Presently holding 8.9-9.0% range since then. Arizona, arguably state toughest time recent surge, seen 7 day moving average positivity rate fall 27.4% 22.8% last week. 

I've reading recent articles indicating virus may begin decelerate 20% people given area get infected. I'm taking gospel truth yet true, would good news sure.

To clear, I'm denier, wear mask public even say matter, think Trump administration's handling nothing abysmal, plans vote Republican November. However, also think virus end world like see valid positions concern turned overreaction. need study taken place throughout world follow data - political agenda. Wow seriously? Math science hard. Maybe disaster make us push math science little schools improve critical thinking skills people make intelligent decisions reach voting age. Mmhmmm literally go back university nine days. piece shit saying believes bottom leadership support decisions. EXACTLY type crisis someone position taking charge leading state consistent messaging people clear plan information provided public. twat nothing. logic, USA get Canada? Right we're maybe one eyed man kingdom blind willingly stabbed eye fork. people nothing contribute society. Quit listening entitled, dumb asses. forgot /s. 

I‚Äôll say prioritize races treatment towards Covid races, that‚Äôs fuckin racist shit. 

I guarantee route choose(they won‚Äôt) lot racists future already. Especially died due prioritization people based skin color. shields stores, took adopted though.

Life (in state anyways) pretty much normal, biggest variation really sometimes see someone mask. first soft lockdown, pretty much got rid indication virus focused efforts economy. coronavirus alert billboards replaced ‚ÄúGo shop!‚Äù (I‚Äôm paraphrasing there, much), used say ‚ÄúStay home‚Äù. state-sponsored level support gone they‚Äôre barely starting talk seriously cases start rise. Even then, doesn‚Äôt matter public backlash measures control virus amping up. angry local leaders audacity think could sweep entire pandemic rug, sympathize position virus become heated political issue battle fact vs. fiction. that‚Äôs also kinda fault allowing fester instead continuing deal it, cause well beginning area.  TGIF? Thank much this. flattened curve Texas' case numbers rising way are, would feel much better using opportunity teach infectious diseases &amp; community responsibility.

In addition many FTE hours brick mortar have, funding dependent attendance. students=more funding. means (on high end estimation) 70% students brick mortar schools 30% students exact work remotely online, lose funding 30% hours won‚Äôt count. lack testing probably crossed 6 figures time ago

Yeah, March. /r/peopleofwalmart/ bring popcorn üçø schools reopen see surge cases/deaths goes beyond worst fears.

If Trump shut actively dismantled pandemic teams, refuse listen warnings, continue sabotage efforts control virus maybe health figures might able something. 100% fault Trump, Fauci. weird, thought 99.74%

why keep going guys Well fair 2016 people realise bad reality TV star president could get yesterday one changed instead today one hard believe country thought inferior much better right?

Admit it, like children lol  Yeah true. taking account possibility see effects July 4th weekend starting next week, numbers could keep rising. even Texas, Florida Arizona. States like Nevada others also beginning set records see increases cases + deaths. Also positive test rate % Someone call press secretary idea.

Damn charts scary. ‚ÄúThis America‚Äù logic here, wouldn‚Äôt hospitals want keep patients ventilators long possible get money? doctors nurses killing patients get money reusing ventilators new patients?

Following that, doctors nurses purposely putting people ventilators don‚Äôt need (before kill them, is)? get cut money coming (since doctors obviously paid commission /s). talking about? unemployed Americans (and reduced work hours income) get $600 flat weekly unemployment check federal government. Plus get whatever state gives varies averages around $300/week. 

And Canadian payment $2000 ($1400 USD) month isn‚Äôt flat payment everybody like many Americans seem think. alternative unemployment, unemployed take bigger amount, (whereas Americans get stack $600/week payment top usual unemployment benefits). 

And ‚Äúbusiness loans‚Äù payroll grants go directly employees remain payroll instead furloughed/laid off. Many countries this. 

Facebook memes news source, that‚Äôs got false idea head. hope that's case, really hard pinpoint going on. 73,388 asymptomatic young people got tested abundance caution 963 people months away death, nothing see folks! National Guard turned convention center field hospital Chicago, even use there. can't places get help national guard? fucking hold up? 

God bless doctor working has, trying best patients.

Edit: looked up, smallish border town. Maybe priority. :(  lack face masks outside casinos well good paper corporations going enforce requirement. city almost big box stores mask requirements place nobody enforcing it. Every Walmart target I've across city plenty people without masks social distancing. claiming found asymptomatic people spread virus

I can't get past this. CDC miles office? moved central NJ TN cultural shock walk grocery store. one wearing mask. still get dirty looks even though they're ""mandatory"" here. No. Canada $2000 ($1400 USD) flat payment unemployed elect take LIEU unemployment (so basically take higher). WAY less Americans get flat $2400 ($3300 Canadian) federal PLUS whatever state gives you. Point made, compounded confirmed. Teachers hesitate address mask distancing violations fear enraging snowflake's Karen. grown ass adults refuse cooperate, know kids indoctrinated little sociopaths. :(  Black Plague corrected various sanitation practices infrastructure, covid spread people breathing without knowing they‚Äôre infected Note: According Worldometer, 50 states Washington D.C. reported numbers today.

Apparently, new infections younger. 

At start pandemic, ifr people 45 .03-.06. means 3-6 die every 10000 infected. 

Let‚Äôs say ifr hasn‚Äôt actually lowered like article says. 

That means hotspots getting 10,000 new infections day see addition 3-6 dead day infections. 

Obviously, older people get infected, number goes up. 

But think good explanation deaths aren‚Äôt skyrocketing. isn‚Äôt going huge increase deaths two weeks young people (the people apparently getting infected now) simply die virus except rare cases.

It's. OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!!!! interested comment. good life lessons adults. World Bank shelved plans second sale pandemic bonds first drew criticism slow pay aid poor nations suffering coronavirus outbreak. 

The supranational agency issued bonds three years ago, $320m deal intended help developing countries tackle serious outbreak infectious disease. mid-April, weeks virus started spreading around globe, conditions pay nearly $200m finally met ‚Äî though critics said little, late. 

A second iteration ‚Äúpandemic emergency financing facility‚Äù, PEF, expected launched year, World Bank said early 2019 making tweaks structure marketing new product around May 2020.

But spokesperson told FT ‚Äúno plans PEF 2.0‚Äù.

Clare Wenham, assistant professor global health policy London School Economics, said bonds ‚Äúan awful scheme‚Äù World Bank ‚Äúdraw line under‚Äù.

‚ÄúIn wake coronavirus outbreak need rethink financing pandemics,‚Äù added. ‚ÄúWe need somehow engage private money public money enough fast enough.‚Äù

The World Bank launched pandemic bond scheme following 2014 Ebola outbreak west Africa, aim finding way funnel private-sector money quickly poor countries faced large-scale, cross-border outbreak.

Investors paid double-digit interest rates, funded donor nations Japan, Australia Germany, set criteria ‚Äî including least 2,500 deaths ‚Äî met. investors would recoup portion investment, remainder went towards tackling health crisis.

Having wait outbreak widespread ‚Äúcounterproductive global health security‚Äù, said Ms Wenham. ‚ÄúThe sooner get intervene, smaller be.‚Äù

In paper published British Medical Journal last year, said scheme ‚Äúseems favour private sector investors global health security‚Äù.

The programme first drew fire bonds‚Äô criteria met Ebola crisis broke 2018 Democratic Republic Congo.

We desperately need grant funds available help countries early stages pandemics

Tim Jones, head policy advocacy group Jubilee Debt Campaign
In April 2019 agency said reviewing structure bonds ‚Äî due mature July year ‚Äî advertised risk modelling company work PEF 2.0 improve programme ‚Äúwhere necessary‚Äù.

After Covid-19 triggered payout year, World Bank announced allocated $195.8m ‚Äî included bonds related swaps ‚Äî 64 eligible countries. Allocations based population size, reported cases whether nations deemed particularly fragile conflict-affected. highest available sum, $15m, went Nigeria Pakistan.

Meanwhile, investors holding bonds ‚Äî including Baillie Gifford, Amundi Stone Ridge Asset Management ‚Äî received interest payments totalled almost $100m end February.

‚ÄúWe desperately need grant funds available help countries early stages pandemics,‚Äù said Tim Jones, head policy advocacy group Jubilee Debt Campaign, rather ‚Äúthese convoluted schemes seem set make money private sector‚Äù.

Olga Jonas, senior fellow Harvard‚Äôs Global Health Institute worked World Bank 33 years, said agency ‚Äúknows [the scheme] embarrassment quiet wrapping up‚Äù.

The bank‚Äôs independent evaluation group assess ‚Äúhow possible happened go wrong‚Äù, added. probably thought number would much worse.... Right track 100k cases day. fucking joke America HUH common version quote ‚ÄúWhen hammer, every problem starts look like nail‚Äù something like that. time cutoff reporting? It‚Äôs 10 eastern, sadly. honestly mind boggling me. That's way half Canada's total cases single day. Lol, yeah, system money buys political outcomes, money buys ads, money buys ground organizations, money buys candidate's way primaries, money needed even gather signatures put ballot, money needed professional staff, money buys pundits TV support cause, money buys ads news networks ensure pull punches covering you, money buys lawyers stifle opposition, police used violently put peaceful attempts force change, *it's ""voting"" that's problem.*

Every single organizational method, tool, apparatus owned operated people money: almost always older people. sure, fault young people able organize together system every tool organisation used owned ultra rich ultra old. 

Idk surprised people wealth free time vote higher numbers people two jobs, bus pass, almost zero candidates reflect values. 

Blaming young people America's political problems like blaming students schools fail. Blame rests people power change things refuse to. Blaming people without power taking power tools so, even violently, hands others ridiculous. Link study? Airborne AIDS really think Brazil reliable far numbers go? were/are burying bodies like crazy rate. see number high 125,000 died way another state. Maybe death counted either states. assume American.

We're 3rd world country lot ways, case noticed. Yeah u know science. need gif I'm suggesting laser focused, can't suggest they're idiots either distance learning can't work young kids one constantly check make sure kids stay focused.

Obviously distance learning going effective college age students manage responsibilities learning, can't rule younger students. done right, I'm sure effective students. There's ideal though. kids need extra help staying track going suffer. Thinking longer terms, things ever go back normal? US bearing inevitable heavier burden second wave earlier countries Oh what‚Äôs America? It‚Äôs getting worse we‚Äôre acting like it‚Äôs good? Cool cool cool. *Deal it.* want dr. fauci adopt me. CKO: Chief Karen Officer agree sentiment, now. would still cases. Hopefully small amount, go back normal. lock much possible reduce impact get vaccine better treatments. isolate wear masks then. fucking virus tricky contagious. Ditto. haven‚Äôt heard anyone paying test. Shitty insurance not. insurance provider also paying covid tests treatments related covid. seen practice, two tests I‚Äôve gone insurance I‚Äôve paid $0, seems legit. also partnered Labcorp Walmart provide free home tests free drive thru testing Walmart market places members. least end year. like multipolar world. see sanctions make world better place. Starving millions Iranians North Koreans going make respective regions stable. Airborne AIDS  dude, think healthy people susceptible negative affects covid gonna get vaccinated, parents gonna someone inject possibly rushed vaccine kids kids susceptible covid, got news you... gonna rush get vaccine gonna wait months see happens? Back adding hundred cases case counts something governors want... Now? embrace it, seems.. Silly woman ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Biden said issue national mask mandate elected. yes, getting Americans actually listen admittedly difficult, start. Or... not.

Sincerely, 

A terrified Florida resident  
A study earlier week found 90% recovered covid-19 patients still ‚Äúat least one symptom‚Äù three months recovery. don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll know severity &amp; real-world effect till year out. 

Also, asymptomatic people apparently lung opacities. It‚Äôs clear might subtly affecting lung function whether might lead anything.

It‚Äôs really pretty freaky virus going get full picture years. (I mean, can‚Äôt get solid data long-term complication rate hasn‚Äôt even studied single full year yet.) FWIW colleague mine studies lung fibrosis says whole field bracing deluge expect hit year.  article : ‚ÄúWhat employees Kaiser secret, according Amy Duaro, infectious disease specialist hospital: social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands touching mouths.‚Äù also understand feel empathy interprets non-praising questions attacks. Don‚Äôt think so. Well powerful man world told worry. press secretary repeats every day big deal young people (because want open schools election nears). Medal Freedom recipient Limbaugh says big deal. Celebrities era Great America, Reagan's 80's, like Chuck Woolery, say hype. 

Fauci done lot imploring anyone, wants start might want start source. place could changed. Sounds like also doesnt extreme case exactly expect us do? vast majority rich people dont *earn* money. got lucky. everybody drive, passion, ability CEO company would far 1% population owning majority wealth.

Every single company/business world structured like pyramid:

A bulk employees frontline workforce put rubber road. smaller fraction leading frontline workers small fraction leading leaders reach top. logically mathematically impossible everyone capable willing positions even opportunity apply.

Not mention vast majority wealthy people really produce anything instead reap benifits disproportionately.

So say ultra wealthy *earned* money, *anybody it* naive insulting get lucky unfairly denied opportunity.

-end rant- number people protesting order magnitude minimum smaller number people going business ppe. clusters protests, compared busy restaurants bars pretty small.

But believe whatever would like. got source accusation? smooth brain come one own. yep, **+73,388** thought could kicked better lower day shove in. Shows much understand what's going on. Would surprise me, Trump conservative, bully helped Republican party gain power obviously becoming liability.

Conservative values stand decency tradition, conservative would act like mention constructing largest bridge Russia connected still illegally annexed Crimea.  ""LAW ORDER!"" long pertain me. It‚Äôs possible quickly keep commit new life style don‚Äôt expect short period work going back old habits. going back want stay healthy. 

Sometimes hard maintain weight fluctuations normal. Don‚Äôt get discouraged period weight gain - use new motivation get back shape, don‚Äôt beat (I‚Äôm really bad that). get weight know works it‚Äôs much easier again. takes lifetime conscious effort stay good shape eating healthy grew poor dietary habits like did. good news start feeling better lot unhealthy foods look less appealing. Sometimes look pictures back can‚Äôt believe me. 

Sorry completely unrequested motivational speech. reminded since size was. I‚Äôm also 6‚Äô weighed 215 five years ago. decided wanted lose weight 180 within three months - weigh 165 see abs flex mirror (I‚Äôve working really hard stay shape quarantine). Good luck weight loss, know too! Yes, people live paycheck paycheck emergency fund! Florida man ... dies That‚Äôs exactly said.... poor person money spends money, rich person keeps it.... look responding to... indicated poor person spending dollar somehow creates growth rich person SPENDING dollar... make zero sense. last paragraph also makes absolute zero logic. rich person spends money goods services money takes path money spent. act like rich people don‚Äôt buy pizzas burgers shop general. Somehow rich people money stays rich people??? didn‚Äôt realize billionaire McDonald‚Äôs street .... provided documents pelvic exam proof need mask. actual fuck? Man, Fauci wasn‚Äôt lying. US could see 100k new cases day rate School germ factories best times. don‚Äôt understand would risk lives person learning. see signs hire subs. world would sub pandemic! could tonight. Aw look plan new strategy WIN!  Yeah, telling people masks ineffective great! actually good practice family months worth food. Two months lot, not? it, rotate never goes bad, ready food shortages. Kobe Bryant‚Äôs death also god damned tragedy. Right cusp whole ordeal. Didn‚Äôt think gonna get worse. wait? get someone yell raise much? everyone use say proud southern heritage means racist shit

Not everyone... *enough*.

And say many northerners look south, good reason.

I mean governor TODAY countermanded mask mandates cities counties Georgia... Atlanta told fuck off, they'd enforcing mask orders anyway, [he sued ""recommends"" wearing mask.

That's exactly something look to... LITERALLY represents state. 141,000 fellow citizens dead watch.... Effective exactly? made night, appreciate it! Hey don‚Äôt worry buddy, think 328 million Americans *didn‚Äôt* try cross border 0.003% aint bad eh. Unfortunately first day couple months ago security guard shot trying enforce someone wear mask, large retailers enforcing. least companies reason. Don‚Äôt like read huh? What‚Äôs disproven myth bond-buying programs (aka ‚Äúprinting money‚Äù) automatically leads inflation. lead inflation supply (currency) keeps demand (the need pay needed goods services doesn‚Äôt magically go away pandemic). **These bond-buying programs ALREADY done (2008) ALREADY lead inflation.**

The Fed isn‚Äôt ordinary bondholder: law, pay profits Treasury. means Treasury makes payments bonds held Fed ‚Äî either paying interest paying maturity ‚Äî almost money eventually moves back Treasury.

When government bond involved, cash moves one government pocket another. central bank buys them, it‚Äôs Treasury never issued first place. 

So yeah, government absolutely afford ‚Äúprint money‚Äù national emergency (which we‚Äôre right now!) take care citizens moves control pandemic. Republicans choosing to, earn political points. Fuck all. doubt r many articles praising Sweden recent days? needed 4 months ago. bit late there... Lol.


I barely catching financially last lock down, accomplish? Nothing.


Another lockdown anything half Americans want Coronavirus go away. 2019 John Hopkins ranked USA No.1 prepared nation pandemic response. everything dismantled, USA still bunch great plans act them. experience too. basically virus made attack brain make society docile? Dr. fellow kids Fauci. seriousness I‚Äôll take advice anyone‚Äôs. possible may wrong something before? course he‚Äôs human I‚Äôd willing bet knowledge gains around virus right is. Seeing tons people shirking personal responsibility like wearing masks dying, seeing families blame government opening early - like people forced go casinos bars wear masks take 0 precaution. 

I feel employees effectively forced hard feel sorry people willingly themselves. 

Personal responsibility thing. Even there‚Äôs mask mandate, it‚Äôs ensure health. Oh I'm know least two those. intelligent, well read people flipping degrees. Yikes like ideology refuses consider possibility would imply ""let spread"" strategy work. 1% total lack almost anyone know taking seriously mid-west taking toll me. I'm starting feel like I'm crazy person wearing mask mandated corporate even management sight. I'll wear store need get something can't get delivered might one two others one on. wife's co-workers shocked said staying home burned PTO days instead going vacation somewhere still socially isolating. would nice felt like together. many underlying conditions (shortness breath, dizziness, asthma mask-acne), perhaps limit excursions essentials only. Starbucks essential someone dire medical condition. Hope worth upsetting anti mask people. George Carlin‚Äôs dumb motherfuckers skit spot years ago... 1 Xinjiang , still tracing *not look bad polls.

I think agree give two shitz news Calm snowflake keyboard warrior guys mean ""precedent""? People shot stabbed Michigan masks. pandemic bringing worst humanity sunlight. r/hedidthemath ""We best numbers anywhere world, even close."" Bait Jesus. never going end. can't hide refrigeration trucks, coffins mass graves. We'll hearing social media least, situation gets bad enough. Deaths continue climb, sure, tracking case growth 3 - 4 week delay. cases finally peak, deaths 3 - 4 weeks later. Troll need get butts back seats. agree, also issue CERB pays minimum wage. people CERB receiving unreasonable amount money, means people putting health risk effectively losing money Sadly money power taking seriously. However encouraging poor lax it. Think Limbaugh Hannity DeVos TN nascar event w 30,000 people? way! y‚Äôall go demand freedom - don‚Äôt forget yer gun!! normal practice Asia wear masks, though, even non-COVID times. US actively told wear masks unless symptomatic save sort PPE healthcare essential workers back Feb/March. fact norm likely helped nations contain first wave. 

Here, pardon memory b/c everything blending together point, mask orders really start May think? God help us. no, honestly experience thus far opposition. teens twenty's know see around use masks religiously. boomers maga mid lifers anti masks. believe within 10 days hospitalization.  I‚Äôve always top I‚Äôd bottom Fauci. store owners, malls, chain store want appear ""the bad guys"" anti-mask lunatics. So, waited government mandate mask take heat them.

But guess can't wait longer. That's it? write down? love thread! ü§£ Texas trying get high score. true colors come out! Probably things said actually true yourself, lol. Add racist filth list. are, ""you people?"" couldnt possibly know anything me. cant spell, speak intellectually, yet said complete ass way, people emergency funds. ignorant asshole reason, someone intelligence refuted you, crumbled resorted petty name-calling... sorry clearly issues work out. Reading physical activity definitely help. hope find need, soon.

Edit: original comment said, "" wat r u even on, wonder u ppl r pour.""

Like WTF wrong dude. Nice try editing real quick, bad leave OG comment edit.. difficult enjoy freedom family ill. why?  General strike many deaths simply reporting? Expect big dump previously unreported deaths first Tuesday November. delusional idiot. Well least OC staying home... sorry basically everyone else Dude I'm totally boomer yah, like two vaccines, got fun diseases. must 30 masks 3 face shields. small bottle sanitizer purse larger bottle truck. even made bought masks two exhusbands, older think like ceiling (Russia) held pillar (Government). Putin comes holds ceiling destroying pillar. ceiling still supported, much unstable. unless another pillar put place Putin dies, ceiling could fall. Sweden's economy good right now. People would changed habits gone lot less own, like re-opening actually saw V-Shaped recovery occur wise people worried going nearly much. got laid off, since many making unemployment + stimulus check. simply want go would happened anyways. 

Since economy built rickety house cards, brutal deleveraging always going result, lockdown lockdown. Holy shit insane know safe even know 50% effective? Payments already delayed months case.. CFL could started later wanted to. Start September cut season 6-8 games I'm good r/coronavirus selfies. never said anything Fauci wrong. Quite contrary. think Fauci right. They're still taking statements. lucky #2/95. Agreed. frankly, what‚Äôs wrong handout? Particularly it‚Äôs going people need money spend basic necessities (food, shelter, utilities, etc). Clinical trial treatment, vaccine.

They much quicker rollouts timeline odd what's essentially lab engineered antibody Jesus terrible comment 
So terrible upvoted it‚Äôs probably spent lot time keyboard warrior fingers.

I truly sincerely hope someday, die, relinquish stupidity hatred deep heart, experience sweet release nothingness makes arguing pointless. Shit thoughts still stand.... ignore ethics lying ""a good reason"" want. fact lied ppl died lie. put link video admits lied mention source?! lmao

if reason officials advocating masks ensure health care workers sufficient stock, say without emphasizing masks useless preventing infection. pure contradiction, makes citizens trust government less say absoultely wear anything even home made covering lmao anti-COVID efforts happening? We've seen prominent figures mild asymptomatic cases, we've seen serious cases. seen yet leading figure joining ranks long haulers. would interesting terms reaction, happened--it would really bring attention potential covid outcome. long road testing capacity testing. We'd hit 100k rather easily scenario. 

Arizona can't really test 15,000 people time (they occasionally gone higher rare) \*stabilised\* positivity rate 24% - testing along lines Florida's 70k (which needs 100k) we'd see 17k cases alone - Florida's positivity 20 percent range 100k tests them...well get picture. 

The reason hit number b/c testing bottlenecks. guess - secondary states coming strong big 4 hotspots hitting plateaus (hopefully) could hit 80k max point next two weeks. They'll frame Democrats cowards pussies. IKR. Feels like it‚Äôs year already. checked decade. I‚Äôd like see Facebook, Twitter Fox News shut .. Yeah selfish young people need stay home ! Oh get damn job they‚Äôre ! surreal, warned. Yeah, Kaiser known great employer.  I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre trying sell hogwash to. decent American would never back someone acted like this, say Conservative party? asthma still wear mask. fibroids...that's it. stop breathing. skimpy article, sounds like refers Kaiser Permanente employees Colorado. Perhaps even one hospital That‚Äôs even argument since went there. second case COVID county guy New York traveling South I-95. pulled gas station called 911 breathing complications. late March.

My state opened early April. Plenty packed bars restaurants around Easter. Yet didn‚Äôt see issue June. tells issue doesn‚Äôt explode 30 days. sitting calling us state assholes people traveled South avoid hell speak of. got little problem want talk us? Trust me. aren‚Äôt going NY way came continue really care comes state elsewhere even care can‚Äôt stop it. Young people longer self quarantine fucking money left, get aid besides 1200$ 5 MONTHS. 

The slave class america left starve become homeless, America actively committing genocide citizens. basically like trying pick cleaner toilet like eat of... Already has, projections find (that counties used set polices) show expected deaths certain things, Like masks distance. see America followed sound sciance would 30k deaths abouts probably want lose insurance.

It's sad situation. terrible time unable pay insurance there's raging pandemic going on, government knows it. suggested million deaths (no timeframe). boss looked like said earth flat. Correct. I'm CERB I'm risk complications catch bastard. 

I would rather repay taxes (and happily will) next years go absolutely necessary risk getting this. would agree, town almost never see anyone outside without mask someone it‚Äôs dirty looks people yelling mask less person. Indoors it‚Äôs taken 11, Whole Foods work we‚Äôve 3 customers come without mask last 2 weeks $1200 barely covers real estate taxes one month (I'm NJ). Clearly it‚Äôs cool open schools.

To give states money, government would acknowledge pandemic getting worse.

This government still threatening defund schools open. you‚Äôd like Facebook censor free speech? That‚Äôs interesting expert experts know mask does? expert medicine, he‚Äôs expert communication. two things combine make someone insanely competent medical professional. smartest person world, doesn‚Äôt matter can‚Äôt communicate effectively wide audience. fact well respected previous administrations proves that. could hear spoke front Trump. obviously wanted say things knew wasn‚Äôt time place given audience. skirted around questions, risk answering fully truthfully outweighed benefits. expert it. somehow none mattered Trump vendetta anyone challenges ‚Äúalternative facts.‚Äù  Kemp must believe publicity good publicity, becauze rose top worst governor list.

Thank you. difficult wake feel like everything completely irreparably broken. get good head buzz GOP approved Koolaid? perfect. Think sitting top seatbelt. Yeah filled requirements: clicked belt. sitting somewhat uncomfortable. like mask. put wrong: uncomfortable still fulfilling ""requirement"" wearing it.

Long story short: wearing mask means wear mask LESS future. states document cities cannot overrule order. Savannah Atlanta way implementing mandates cities considering issued. Note state order says ""encouraged"" ""required"". enforceable. order went out, Kemp sued Atlanta issuing mandate. Kemp open think mask wearing required. wear masks public. he's attacked local officials suggesting required. Regret wrong word. Despair, maybe.  Totalitarian regimes fake numbers, Democracies cannot fake numbers function democracies. vote nullified voting fake information.  

Perhaps don‚Äôt know this, West known China types dictatorships regularly fake numbers anything everything decades. 70 years, China releases GDP - propaganda number - economists West try work number closer real GDP looking evidence, essentially Intelligence information.

So newspapers report China‚Äôs GDP, give ‚Äòofficial‚Äô GDP China reports, plus ‚Äòreal‚Äô (estimated) GDP.  

The fact China fakes numbers one reason democratic West looks Chinese government.

China faking Covid19 information ‚Äúok‚Äù it‚Äôs *expected* competent democracy digs real information using available statistics Intelligence information.

For example, back knew 14 people infected covid19 arrived countries travelling China, epidemiologist used statistics work likely *real* number infected inside China, 100 times higher official Chinese number reported time.   news report epidemiologist estimation back January.  gave West great picture fast epidemic spreading first case reported.  

(China welding Wuhan citizens shut inside flats was... perhaps... another clue? 

/s)

Any Western government response pandemic based China‚Äôs official pronouncements instead Intelligence pronouncements homicidally negligent. Fauci full shit deserves Behind pal. ‚ÄúThug life‚Äù. negative tests reasons people testing negative getting multiple test results. positives name captured once,‚Äù said.  means person multi

""May ask wearing mask?""

""I'm afraid die."" Navarro: I‚Äôm social scientist I‚Äôm basically qualified analyze medical data - says man made fake scholar quote book. goddamn clownshow. Let‚Äôs say deaths 5% 100 5. Fewer tests, say 50, deaths still 5. percentage 10%. anyone around Trump math? Absolutely, know testing causes COVID. Prez got people take tests school. get COVID school he? QED. increase 19% since last Thursday. tomorrow follows trend last Friday, 85,000 tomorrow. Yikes. singing gospel friend. pisses today USA. Scroll Map z-scores, hover Sweden. 

For week 27 z-score 2, means there's excess mortality.

But right, checking historical values, actually excess mortality already week 22, correct title would ""No excess mortality second time since week 12.""

So news even better title reflects. bad. Put numbers personal context see them. Almost 140,000 people died US, right? grew small coastal town, every single person town dead, along half dozen neighbouring towns. exes, old teachers, neighbours, friends people know least used seeing around dead now.

I find making personal makes realize horrifying actually is.

And, globally speaking, almost 600,000 people died. Again, speaking US terms, entire state Wyoming dead. Or, almost DC Vermont dead.  knew early on. knew type mask would help advised it. hero worship sadness. shortages hospitals medical employees companies willing pay keep employees safe. giant private hospital area doesnt enough money, even pay ppe, $5 BILLION buy new location.

At time Fauci made comment, 30+ research papers saying mask work, 1 says mask make worse.

Trump tripped practically nearly every political land mine possible still managed win (yay electoral college system). He's gotta troll. not, he's legitimately one brain-dead people I've ever seen Reddit. Last summer hotter. record breaking heat wave back July 2019. Well president trying funnel Covid Data WH instead CDC cook numbers something China we're becoming China..hate break ya  Nobody talking vaccinating whole world. Theoretically vaccinated even third US would pretty well off.

Same countries, much smaller populations. 

Unfortunately, unless big countries like India Brazil open pocketbooks see getting vaccine last (unless develop own) Huh, nifty. know would happen, imagine means large supply nearby people complain job with. That's underrated workplace perk. Multiply million get real amount. Stop fantasy. nowhere close vaccine prevents covid19. vaccine trial data suggests cherry picked patients successful results. sample sizes low, can‚Äôt generalize entire population it. people selected trial cherry picked likely people good health. obese people used, people underlying issues. Either way, it‚Äôs good representation society studies.

And I‚Äôve heard, antibodies die body 3-8 weeks getting vaccine.  me, that‚Äôs effective vaccine. that, wonder it‚Äôs really vaccine anything, like high dose vitamin c, d, zinc prescribe it, work vaccine nothing. wish people would stop doubling down. going LOSE like precious confederacy. owner something? imagine world easy fire cop fast food employee shitty customers won‚Äôt follow food safety standards?

That's problem. must open schools let science get way. help economy!!

Opening schools killing innocent teachers kids help great country! strong tests. strong. best tests world ever seen.

(SAID ONE EVER EXCEPT POWERFUL MAN PLANET) im 100% pro UBI. know average wage people? $40-50k depending state province. $2000 minimum wage workers (retail, fast food, etc) make. tax, $24k year close $40k salary taxed. 

I make quit job im confident mass quitting jobs. Employers would maybe even offer get people work crappy jobs people would continue work extra disposable income. downside prices would def increase guess would balance people money spending more.

If actually taxed rich could reality. studies UBI gives people better quality life, eat better go back school course nothing. Maybe content rent room play video games. would fine truthfully people want career, job feels good complete something. Ron Howard: was. must stroke.

Edit: I've rarely heard someone artificially bolstering argument X 1,000. like $18 thousand per citizen. first thing thought saw actually opening Disney Space Mountain. whole line, usually 2 hour wait, inside, lot enclosed tunnel. Good luck social distancing whole way that.

Letting people die, seems, fairly unpopular. absolutely cares news, tweets day protests cause worth dying for.  Football, much.  Especially watch televised it‚Äôs played empty stadium.

Be interesting know differently true called long time ago. don‚Äôt mandate lockdown control spread virus eventually people become scared crater economy need electrical work done tomorrow, specifically wire install ceiling fan son's room. Besides masks (which wear anyway) open windows, precautions taking?  Like boss piece missing employers taken precautions protect employees. Hospitals ppe, grocery stores installing plexiglass increasing cleaning. places like also allow reasonable social distancing shorter interactions. large offices still keeping employers home possible. profession like machinic can't done home, shops created guide lines protect employees, like one car time. 
In classroom, teacher asked spend 6 hours direct contact students, may may wearing masks. teachers asked wear mask still project voices loud enough hear 30 students. 
The districts schools might say try reduce class sizes, certainly funding allow it. Teachers asked clean classrooms, secondary schools, inbetween every class, typically time allowed use restroom. provided cleaner, funding available, gone, gone.
Education done online, technology. great, insurmountable. employers job done remotely, is, i.e. banking, customer service, etc. education become main source childcare every family America, pushing teachers physically classroom. 
Don't excuse need education need babysitter, 2 different things. Username checks someone explain people like conservative dad seem think fauci blame rise spread covid? excuse blame anyone isnt trump cant justify vote way. This, maybe give money anyone claims it.

I personally credit huge part indoctrinating dad nonsense.

There several people who's painful death delight me. Rush Limbaugh one them. Ah yes, suddenly it‚Äôs president charge country. Twent-EE Fauc-EE. 

You gotta put emphasis right syllables. research May. wonder like July. Remember flu bad send refrigerated trucks bodies?

Me neither Yea dad listens rush radio, rush shitting Fauci lately blows mind. need people make minor sacrifices. We're asking pack stuff, go mid-east, get shot Christ's sake. Holy freaking shit.  u/nightpanda893 wants fauci‚Äôs nuggets like sat next Mike Pence lied entire nation beginning pandemic. said ""you need mask already COVID19"". guy politician. Fuck him. Unpopular slightly tangential opinion here: elementary school kids, give much fuck risks ‚Äúnot learning‚Äù past spring coming fall even next year? It‚Äôs like potty training: matter badly it‚Äôs going, every pediatrician reassure fact stop pooping time leave college. far I‚Äôm concerned it‚Äôs elementary school curriculum...they eventually learn calculate perimeter rectangle put words alphabetical order - says now? designed rigid ass system literally life death learn shit immediately? best life lesson teach kids shit happens plans change feel scared sad pissed sucks take care yourself, family community survive. kids come resilient AF adults mindful what‚Äôs actually important bunch arbitrary hoops jumped later. Agreed. continue called sheep, religious, blind followers trump, fictitious character posts conspiracy web page. Yep. free thinkers....  No... countries Europe opening schools low caseloads low positivity rate tests. contact tracing isolation positives.

If similar position, also mask mandate schools (instead bunch conspiract theorists screaming freedom), would say yes, we've minimized risk--open schools.  canon. Maybe. see iceberg, we're heading right it, captain's idiot crew incompetent,half passengers suicidal half locked deck, lucky ones lifeboat. looking good. Sad Conservatives would rather worship believe someone doesn‚Äôt believe science nation‚Äôs top doctor. feeling everyone utilities, phone company, rent, etc would slowly ramp prices soak money Well think people wear masks, shooting ones don‚Äôt makes happy? ever dislike, dum think past decade truly shown broken society culture.

The fact asking question genuine question icing fucking cake.

No, no, icing that's leftover bottle. even looked cake yet. uhm, rhyme? maybe i'm pronouncing name wrong? I'm mistaken, Grand Union, pretty damn ubiquitous northeast, owned Big Star 80s early 90s.  Agreed, recent surge mostly caused youths gathering, parties, protests bars, thus median age infection dropped drastically. That‚Äôs next opening line bar 1 day 1k months.. said 3k day.. never happen. I‚Äôll count chickens.  Trumps medals dont really count though. They're like old reddit silver. reason interested announcing world idea talking about? deliberately lying?

Deaths spiking virtually spiking case states, it? moron spreading disinformation? American thing give money. ""Work money!""

Andrew Yang ran resistance UBI $1000 /mo Americans running president. Eventually 67 something percent people started supporting UBI. Huge considering support single percent digit beginning.

At times like money would help people tremendously. many people going public work bills pay. worst kind people. BS Georgetown, JD Harvard Law. Stupidity ignorance excuse here, intelligent *fucking evil*. It‚Äôs matter time China Russia militarize I've left house probably 12 times total. 10 groceries, 2 beer. MASKS everytime, including mid-march got weirdest looks ever Painters mask on.

Oh groceries, Pick-up every time. see inside store since March, liquor store, 2 times. self absorbed asshole. feel man, love US botched continue to.

I finally seeing light months staying home small space 5 people. sucked worst year life tried make best it. watches tons movies, lots good take finally starting go again, mask family social distance. feels together Canada. working home possible, masks mandatory stores people starting go masks. people realize end this. stupid virus damaged farms, buildings, factories, roads, etc, like war would, anything make clearer need band together humanity incredibly vulnerable, humans can't pass basic intelligence test sort things properly. He‚Äôs 79 cool üòé idea asking me. Grazie think announced culling minks IMHO could taken precautions let COVID-19 burn farms 2-3 weeks. Would good study too.

There one. Yeah 77 year old president 79 year old VP... Biden's already pushing luck, considering notoriously taxing presidency person's mental health. Fauci... would cruel make VP pandemic, let poor bastard enjoy rest life.

America's politicians *so* fucking old. Ginsberg like 87, McConnell's 78, Pelosi's 80, shit ridiculous. whole country's stability hinges health bunch geriatric patients mean sound disparaging either, kind reality. don‚Äôt want see point. There‚Äôs difference.. It‚Äôs Fauci time! Defund cut spending two different things. Stop moving goalposts 4 months.

March 15th everyone started shutting down. nominate Fauci president. Good luck! hope make full recovery!  going feel silly days even higher. putting houses straw. Well 2 weeks then. CDC getting actual data anymore going white house, predict announce Covid ""gone"" 2-3 weeks, time school start  government suppressing data cutting CDC out.   Fucking hell. hope look great I'm 60, much less 80. northeast must last place Kroger yet invade. never disclosed data now, unlike Pfizer.

So, hype there. quick count picture majority people wearing masks. You‚Äôre really lumping Biden Tom Hanks Rush Limbaugh? dad would listen younger. hateful going overboard speech could get away radio. Fuck man. sure. know long term damage cytokine storms cause people illnesses.  worst people produce little energy normal cell processes weak leave house, change bedding, laundry, cook. That‚Äôs worst case scenario, need *numbers* many affected stage energy production deficit.  

The internal organ scarring (not lungs) bad covid19 cases shown internal scans.

Generally speaking terms living things: death ‚Äúlagging‚Äù indicator? Fauci misled?

What changed mind? Deep dish state Seriously, think someone would say ""Donald, could like general leading us victory. could like Churchill rally Americans together..."" Nope, instead goes around circles like broken toy. I'm hard time really happy since told people wear masks first place. 

I get wanted PPE available medical professionals, ways go it. Medical professionals danger anyways public wear masks. I'm pretty big deal could try something different. 

Maybe drive Uber, revolt? realize speculation, I'm gathering statement potentially massive discrepancy numbers reported HHS CDC going forward. 

Is true? resources available help layman get easy access sets information digestible format? 

I know vast number reporting agencies created platforms aggregate data, I'm curious hear opinions knowledge. point def still stands, noted Rebecca Prevots head epidemiologist NIAID, Fauci Fellow Americans, shithole country whose lack hygiene failed epidemic response strikes fear developed world. remember low key worrying February... still going restaurants work. low key anxiety back though. truly hit home Italy, change lifestyle choices went self-quarantine March 11.

Wait bullshit plan could worked? Pick fucking country lie

Other countries sane political response. countries deal people panic hoarding. said theoretically would worked. could forgiven $50k every failed mortgage 2008 solved crisis derivatives market. Instead paid premium would cost bail people made derivatives blew world's economy, evicted victims good measure. astonishing much cheaper handle sorts crises correctly compassionately. actually better economy destructive among us claim primary focus. They're greedy transparently evil jackasses. Cancer, herpes, MERS, SARS, jock itch, allergies...no cure, eluding take longer November eradicate, treatment symptoms possibly. Hope you‚Äôre right though. part world catch in? LoL, truth is, China barely keep covid control..A welfare state democracies similar luck, they're islands, places slam border shut, nobody trying hard get out. 

The rest world, mostly capitalist centric economies MUST run minimally protected ""essential"" grunt labor, logistics, repair, food prep, emergency medical keep economic engines least low idle, going get many hundreds thousands killed. Certainly millions fall. ""maybe"" workable vaccine roll out, stay ahead mutation rate bit. Probably unless something really novel. 

Otherwise, 5-8% global population die inside 3 years. CDC safe bet. Test results getting reported directly White House, White House find ""error"" CDC making, numbers immediately drop. ""Like miracle, go away"" pay it. Fauci didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúWear facial covering public even it‚Äôs made cloth, don‚Äôt buy N95 masks needed healthcare workers‚Äù, said masks ineffective discouraged use. This, along many statements made February March proven false

It‚Äôs bizarre Trump gets criticised handling virus top infectious disease expert country advising White House Covid sucks it‚Äôs tragic it‚Äôs crucial kills people mass. data supports it‚Äôs younger age group. Show data treatment think it‚Äôs likely

I know people sent home nothing doctor ER. doctors let pass virus naturally OTC medicine. Everyone know corona basically even went hospitals pretty expensive security teams. Cancer, herpes, MERS, SARS, jock itch, allergies...no cure, eluding take longer November eradicate, treatment symptoms possibly. Hope you‚Äôre right though. 20% number still hold up? remember Wuhan days. Another quote people poor article.

In Sweden winter holiday schools closed. hardest hit region Sweden Stockholm. Stockholm winter holiday February 25 March 1. lot people went skiing countries like Italy Austria. People roots countries went visit. Austria Iran two countries people went visit brought back Covid-19 from. famous epidemiologist said. Let's pretend travel habits swedes big impact Covid-19 spread Sweden.

There also problems comparing death rates since countries classifying Covid-19 deaths way. looking excess deaths one see many countries official numbers low. Excess death count make small populations look worse comparison baseline imply good. everybody country dies heart diseases 50 Covid-19 may cause many excess deaths. still better measure death count.

Sweden war centuries. missing generations. know disease mainly kills old people. demography population weighted comparing countries.

Many sites Covid-19 number Sweden way low population number. official number 10 348 730. true number higher. countries though.

When using per capita comparison one careful. First, groups one comparing relevant groups big size differences. way disease works seems large outbreaks somewhat small regions specific communities. comparing country level seems pretty irrelevant science point view. Oddities evens outs larger groups. instance easier calculate much food drinks get party 100 guests 5.

The real problem Sweden preparation flaws system. lack gear beginning. People working elderly often low education work hour may able stay home feel bit sick. hand hygiene poor known years. elderly meet lot different persons within care system. elderly homes correlation many people meet death count. homes persons work larger groups number deaths higher. information people communities high number none native swedes late put information google translated made sense.

I also think travel ban within country 50 person limit gatherings could put place earlier.

5 593 dead swedes. horrible high number. US 141 118 deaths least states counting. Fucking. BALLER. LMAO, research? Guess doctors nurses wear fashion before... please stop spreading disinformation. That's good metric though, 140,000 population (roughly) city currently live in, Dayton, Ohio. state ‚Äúwe‚Äôd infected took handful‚Äù come ‚Äúeven small handful cases harmful‚Äù?

NY hotspot March April. willing accept travel state bad thing state. unwilling accept NYers traveling states could harmful us time. that?

Look don‚Äôt agree way Florida Georgia handled situation around here. hate long took everyone view masks life saver liberal conspiracy. promise idiots aren‚Äôt exactly running New York. Disney World opened back they‚Äôve got plenty things home keep busy. say coming NY argument coming hypocritical point view. watch video sounds looks like 88 year old. Still mood mock China, good you. don't. Provide evidence. Give week people still think mask wearing unconstitutional. Morons. donut hole one, please. part problem. Different areas different cost living. $1200.00 goes lot farther North Dakota California.

I've always thought area Cost Living multiplier make fair. fuck aren't! Well... Okay, except Florida. 'July' funny way spell 'April'. However insurance one setting price flight... hospital. agree health insurance take heat hospital charging price What's rather shocking none newspapers cable news outlets anyone really talking psychologists terms helping nation stress this. Literally talk all. 

America country going covid. bunch countries got lockdowns, even severe ours, fine. Nobody went crazy. needs inside body kill coronavirus.  think that's stupid measurement too, argument here. chance blows bad calls election fall. Best proverb Oh, sweet summer child. suggestions this? üéâüéâüéâNew recordüéâüéâüéâ


This try go outside Okay stop using 9/11 measurement then? Death death it‚Äôs tragic, downplay doesn‚Äôt hurt many people I‚Äôm forefront problems ignorant deliberately want virus spread. past 24 hours:

USA - + 73,338

China- +1 (seriously, reported 1 case)

Assuming China lying. assuming due testing rates (as China tests like crazy, done 90M tests far)...if knowledge either country would never assume USA first world nation. ‚ÄúGot nice county there. shame someone, corona‚Äôd it‚Äù- AZ probably. r/itcosinedinaflash Oh wow nobody ever thought geez, im sure took mask every 500+ photos taken multiple makeup light adjustments angle adjustments get made, according guidelines age, unlikely put mask amount times would put risk according CDC guidelines. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt hard come with‚Äù. Keep celebrating model hypocrite  Registered case count 2019/07/17, 13:49 local time.

^(Also something something US far bigger numbers etc. etc. etc.) nobody remember coronavirus started spread Fauci told Americans wear mask, doesn‚Äôt help stop spread virus insisted people acquire masks.  literally happened.  expect random dumb people oppose masks, it‚Äôs harder forgive experts giving us horribly negligent advice. agree open been. politics says page even situation business could choose stay open close, closed government would take care business employees choose reopen... We'd still screwed. virus spread unless follow roadmap laid countries seeing little cares reopening now.

The irony still hear people talk we're greatest country we're exact example handle pandemic we're headed second shutdown we're awesome.

As unemployment, probably right. working improving since March? friends family president that, shame \-Sweden close schools.  
\-Their contagion level nothing like america's. 
\-Sweden higher death rate neighbors higher mortality rate America.  
\-There nothing take away positive news way.

""The country's mortality rate coronavirus 30% higher United States, adjusted population like Lone Ranger, right? ü•¥ Yes - also waiting hospital whistleblowers emerge. don‚Äôt think believe things. think self indulgent prigs spoiled society allowed spread poison serve ends. bullshit real damage, undermines country. that‚Äôs want.

Let's arm guns though. /s Yes please want free money helped create anti-mask thruther culture though...

Fauci among several public officials wrongly stated evidence masks effective. However, plenty peer reviewed papers showed efficacy masks original SARS outbreak many respiratory diseases. saying technically since weren‚Äôt really studies Covid19 yet, couldn‚Äôt know certain masks could work. white lie buy time frontline workers get PPE. However, original deceit laid groundwork anti-mask truthers culture really think humble contributions pandemic. gas station day. Two guys walk employee says mask.

Eventually guy pulled shirt face said work. employee said sure. acknowledge sometimes private industry reasonable effective government?

Screaming reddit void helps haha. tbf husband seems chill striking. understand choice, rolling dice cities, counties states refusing enact proven harm reduction seems like abhorrent miscalculation.

all world, see active harm reduction worked. yet everyones like, welp, pittance means im looking create dead.  knew I‚Äôd get comments like this. point many people get (apparently) prestigious medal don‚Äôt deserve it. Sure Rush probably bottom list, many poor examples. See thing like that. Sowing division. Attacking personally. Clearly lying.

Heavily recommend giving Marshall Brain's read! People simply gone mad. We‚Äôre talking doctor fighting guy thinks finite amount energy that‚Äôs it. Yeah. KNOW one never fight. one maintain/repair electrical grids, internet infrastructure, HVAC system etc. Even Mitch said wear masks June 29 They're scrambling displace blame, Fauci gonna fall guy. Good too. 138,000+ deaths = ‚Äúfucking nothing‚Äù

Stay strong science!! hate say this, going get better soon. governor seems intent pretending happening european union lost  rant. see Facebook feed families going vacation Florida, nobody wearing masks, smiling crowded beaches...like normal. fucking irresponsible! I‚Äôm terrified bringing Covid back small hometown family lives. Fuck you. required quarantine Florida rest fucking summer.

Yeah idk either way that's terrible idea. People stopped caring media health care ""experts"" cheered mass protests. certain President that!  Cousin Georgia‚Äôs governor... Nothing wrong disparaging Pelosi 2% gang represent! oh okay Change r URL c. instead www.reddit... www.ceddit...

It crazy anti Fauci, looks like replied wrong post something. time get everyone wear masks spring time middle summer. Found gem CDC website, ""Psychology Crisis"". analysis psychology people That's true, I'd like add:

I remember really mean kids grade school, none would allowed 130,000+ people die personal gain. worst thing call kids gay slurs trade Yu Gi Oh cards (against rules reason). white house staff allows hundreds thousands people get killed. worse ""dictators"" Honestly can‚Äôt imagine going better even national mandate look people saying it‚Äôs hoax, created China, etc. think they‚Äôd saying actually good job numbers control. Instead hot spot world 138,000 deaths people saying it‚Äôs hoax. It‚Äôs fucked. November can‚Äôt come quick enough Interesting much varies, I‚Äôm seeing close 100% wearing masks stores Delaware

That said ... think mandates help even enforced. Even don‚Äôt reach every person always people convinces feel exact way  Nah multiple factors consider. believe large gathering people chanting 0 social distance ""very low risk"" according media health experts. 

And mask argument, watch live stream photos protest, ""everyone"" ""most"" protesters wear mask ""all time"" gigantic lie. 

Like BS. Could mod please delete this? 5 months old... know better now. kind huge news However, message always clear. times ran masks. 

Feb 20, 2020: William Schaffner, preventive medicine professor Vanderbilt University School Medicine, told CNN rush buy masks ""psychological coronavirus coming, feel rather helpless,"" said Saturday.

AK, AL; NH, NJ, NM, NV, NY; MO, MS person stole social security number forged signature 2018 taxes got mine.  I‚Äôm southern NH see people masks probably 95% time indoors, less outdoors. 

Anything central northern wouldn‚Äôt surprised people lax it‚Äôs basically whole different work there. boyfriend moron friends. Maybe deserve need ask others obvious decision is. Wow Orange dude Canadian Mexican built vehicles lawn. days ago someone used say ""USA actually handled covid situation pretty well"".

If look like situation completely spiraling control, delusional. He's ""effective"" something :) moved blaming Fauci. don‚Äôt care numbers anymore since can‚Äôt claim going down. They've attached position claiming hoax fit original statements, keep acting like serious, contrarian towards anything said smart people takes seriously. Unfortunately complicated that. I've planet enough decades know people world over. Incorrect. Pepper gel loud taser Yep rejected it. What's real estate tax?   time believe something evidence it. 

Personally, think mass gathering potentially risky happen all... evidence resulted transmission people suggesting ""just because"". Victorian opposition party trying use gotcha moment say ""see! right!"" Instead arguing basis potential existed. ""Don't wear masks, arent effective""

-Dr. Fauci True US divided smaller, manageable entities budgets resources.  past months sweden admit elderly care homes hospitals anymore.

So every bar represents 35 weeks deaths, covering flu seasons instead calendar years, going back 20 years. covid-19 deaths included bars 2019/20 flu season, still statistical Sweden's excess deaths year.

Compared last two years, yes. Compared historical 20-year average, April deadliest month Sweden 27 years.

Yes, specifically April bad. cumulatively, flu season simply look bad Swedes died neighbors mortality rates 30% higher America's

Of covid-19, yes, yes, bla, bla, bla. I'm talking all-cause deaths. look all-cause deaths eliminate differences countries report covid-19 deaths, Covid Sweden previous flu season, upcoming one.

Sure, that's true. flu season still become worse previous ones, still go historical average. happen, 10000 people would die covid-19 Sweden next three months. seems incredibly unlikely.

And sure, 2020/21 flu season become worse one historical average. happen Sweden would experience second wave winter that's larger wave year. think that's likely either. stupid, selfish irresponsible.

Bottom line, President Trump calls performance success. must is. misunderstand. saying people using declining death rate downplay virus say headed right direction false narrative. Fauci, Prada, Fendi No, China cHina china China /s demand, supply quickly fill void assuming government distort market.

School reopening concern 12 weeks now.

July 4th two weeks ago, impact close baked cake. 

Sitting lawn chair watching fireworks isn‚Äôt risky. think falling weekend impact. *We‚Äôre number 1! We‚Äôre number 1!*

*Murica! suck everything still think you‚Äôre best!* Maybe hide science behind needless intellectual property laws? Stick drug patents erection pills. like Jonas Salk instead. bad things are, terrible Trump is, think underestimate potential damage military coup would do, especially right tensions already sky high. say whatever want boost stock price, still LOT testing required confirm safety efficacy. time required make 7 billion doses distribute them.

Don‚Äôt forget, fastest vaccine developed mumps took 4 years. get mask-wearing data? Self-reported data notoriously bad, stronger outward image focus among selfie generations motive basic logic looking numbers. knee jerk reacting every little issue arises thousands miles away. Anyone makes blanket statement schools closed across nation clearly thinking rationally emoting reason want feelings validated.

As said, NY different places. lockdowns now, using advantages return level normal. outbreak occurs deal it. especially true poorer sections NYC reports neighborhoods seeing herd immunity levels outbreak. Religious protest? knows drive point home. effectively communicate masses need stay message repeat ad nauseum. states like New York similar numbers start pandemic. means testing people symptomatic contact someone tested positive. Basically testing people expect positive since testing capacity limited. case someone planning trip reads this. Coronavirus passes shit stays shit 30 days. want avoid touching surfaces shit ""flume"" could splatter flushes. means always shut lid try touch anything. Avoid public toilets clean ones must use. 
A good bet take spray disinfectant hotel spray tank inside lid, well wiping seat, wall etc. disinfectants need 10-15 minutes saturate area. Soap unlocks virus also.

Gotta protect capitalist interests lest experience negative side business god forbid spike cases started 6/13. 4 weeks. See kids, happens use much peroxide hair don‚Äôt stop Q-tip feel resistance! brain turns mush!

I know irony impaired, wonder listen talk. rank top 5 absolute stupid things ever heard! I‚Äôm deleting 2020 memory  Certain areas better others. I'm Indiana, know several people gotten same-day tests got results 12-24 hours. said, 6 surrounding counties, here, worst one ~1000 cases since March, 100 lower. certainly value work ethic. would trivial make cash relief contingent basic civil duties. example, could tie calling certain percentage neighbors day week, assisting elderly vulnerable chores keep safer, learning skills like first aid. amount fear anxiety parents getting sick worse worse every day. state doesn‚Äôt huge numbers reported yet, enough assholes could take day. guys dont fat kids though, kids fat. Time get Georgia Smart anything it. Plenty dumbass townies wearing masks too. decent person. thought reversed that? That‚Äôs Netherlands didn‚Äôt get overwhelmed it. also took precautionary measures like plastic shielding around desks (which I‚Äôm sure US won‚Äôt do) I‚Äôm assuming don‚Äôt population density schools US it‚Äôs 30-40 kids classroom matter much evidence public knowledge continue ask evidence. sea lioning trolls super obnoxious never engage discussions good faith. seems possibility--from decent sources--that children may 50% less likely spread covid adults.

Problems are:

1. WAY early factor way address this, much maybe, and

2. Even 100% dead accurate, much useful data places transmission low (schools, example, might considered safer bars nightclubs), meaningless transmission high, even 50% less likely still far likely safe. Yeah even bother listening authorities anymore. #Translation:


A Swede Little London Esbjerg [Denmark] Wednesday night tested positive corona Thursday. annoys owner Little London, sending employees quarantine. 

A Swedish guest visited bar Little London Wednesday night, Thursday tested positive corona.

The owner Little London, Carsten Prisfeldt says.

- first reaction annoying.. second reaction could happened sorts places, fault, good all, says.

We contacted authorities followed recommendations. already sent employees home quarantine, tested weekend.

Little London contacted Thursday morning Swede's employer, offshore company, told guest tested positive corona.

- Many offshore companies regularly test employees. probably someone who's symptoms, says.

- contacted authorities followed recommendations. already sent employees home quarantine, tested weekend, says.

He says 75 people bar connection watching football match Arsenal Liverpool, Swede sat hour table middle room good distance others. Swede sat 20.30 21.30.

- taken precautions hope spread.

Carsten Prisfeldt says bar told health authorities welcome stay open.

- follow situation keep eye whether become infected. followed procedures told must reopen today. course, encourage stay home symptoms, says Carsten Prisfeldt, also made Facebook post reach guests also present Wednesday night, tested.

He hopes people get nervous therefore refrain visiting bar, emphasizes could happened anywhere.

The bar surfaces disinfected, calmly get Little London, says owner Carsten Prisfeldt. 

- might well happened somewhere else taking precautions. whole bar disinfected, hand sanitizer available bar toilet, annoying happen here, says Carsten Prisfeldt. *Swat team rolls up, guns blazing.* Less people using A/C I'd imagine. fans/open windows. SHIT. mean kids human? alive? breathing sneezing coughing? immune death certain age? Ignorant questions like causing many ppl get sick infected. lack basic fucking common sense gone. You‚Äôre parent no? kids? Act grown don‚Äôt kids. Kids taking care kids joke. Y‚Äôall bouta add homeless population Wow, one case, better shut again. don‚Äôt. hate trump antics every fiber being. pandemic brought one thing glaringly light. sides same. Anyone truly believes point Hillary Clinton would done equally bad job trump presidency complete utter moron.

I hope cry babies either vote ""stomach"" one intelligent driven women politics happy. hope they're seeing dead dying happy. helped cause much administration did. due respect, no. they're going bars spreading thing like wildfire, that's them. they're wearing masks, that's them. anti vaxxers, that's them. get top priority vaccine cannot distributed cover ""herd."" commented link dump isnt biggest public health policy desaster European history then?

Here scientists actively adviced masks initially.

I'm sitting popcorn watch America burn. stupid attitudes anti-intellectualism combined egocentric society politics economically enslaving population gonna come hailing guys.

But yeah, best country world. Best healthcare world. Best education world too, right?

I'm sure that's Faucis fault, lol, entire government led fucktards predicting virus vanish April.

All virus basically demask USA's oligarch populist regime.

Good luck, fun. post source Mack truck me. Caterpillar road compactor. makes mess. Lol, that‚Äôs also relationship getting better way. Hope natural selection apply crucial supply chains WH literally said ignore science send kids school yesterday. administration would fall knees type gross negligence incompetence. [Current Hospital (updated Mondays, Wednesdays Fridays). exception Arizona, hospitals filling up, Covid-19 patients, put getting healthcare needs fulfilled. Zero 80% overall capacity. One, Georgia, 80% ICU beds. anything like last shutdown wont effective. Especially since people everything avoid actually staying quarantined, lockdown ends party time. actually interesting question, sure it‚Äôs downvoted. I‚Äôd curious see affect prevalence AC Covid transmission. 

Can‚Äôt find definitive numbers web, suggest 90% US homes AC versus around 5% Europe. Places like Italy Spain seem outpace neighbors (e.g. Spain apparently 33% homes/80% rentals.) 

That said, Japan Korea highest prevalence AC use outside US, they‚Äôre significantly better terms controlling spread. spread really can‚Äôt placed solely AC use wonder _absence_ AC helps give certain areas advantage? doctors able lie interest greater public health? Seems unethical me. nobody surprised. mention it, almost like I've heard visual effects migraines described. ""Tunnel vision"" almost - except tunnel blurry everything unrecognizable. find interesting people opine things clearly know nothing about. 

Admit it. scientific knowledge antibodies cells. opining it? could ever feel like know you‚Äôre talking clearly don‚Äôt? 

Like, know haven‚Äôt read actual scientific sources subject (if had, you‚Äôd understand way immune system works... clearly don‚Äôt), I‚Äôm wondering feel safe forming opinion all. 

And even shocking take incorrect opinion, debate side it, pass judgement people actually correct. 

I feel know better. Perhaps you‚Äôve gotten wrapped propaganda sub, you‚Äôve become anti-science. High risk based race. High risk elderly people chronic health problems compromise ability defend virus.

If turned black person cancer covid 19 vaccine I'd say would racist right?

Now person white still racist? trying start fight, wanted demonstrate race never deciding factor people treated people based healthcare needs are. understand least 1-8 week lag, correct? posted article German one showed Masks Reduce Covid Spread 40% http://archive.vn/yN2bL It‚Äôs hyperbolic say don‚Äôt know something. hyperbole dismissing something without knowing it. Unlike you, I‚Äôm willing dismiss even rare number people getting reinfected shedding virus. Research pointed stance time.

OK buddy call out, talking shit right now. That's absolutely true. People around world(except U.S. course) knew wear masks. knew one primary way virus spread recommended New research contradicted it.

Yea making shit now. I‚Äôm disgusted trump goons. Democratic socialism bread butter. It‚Äôs OSHA... every regulatory body hamstrung right big boys know it. amount times I‚Äôve tried ripped since start pandemic insane. con artists know there‚Äôs one watch they‚Äôre taking full advantage Fauci knocked-up RBG baby would probably able move things thoughts. opportunity whole nation paying attention lockdown. rest world, even professionals ""enemies"" China, telling us masks effective necessary. didnt listen instead sent opposite message. masks didnt work use them. 

Many people still believe truth. Many people trusting CDC similar authorities mixed messages. messed up, personally think acknowledgement failure necessary. hard people admit wrong? Instead act like never happened.

Not mention CDC completely botched testing early pandemic, therefore setting us months behind nations properly able identify cases isolate spread. Obviously 2 positive patients need 2 tests detect them. But, cases going down, number positive tests also going regardless number tests given. See NY's test tracker tests ever, cases continue fall [1].

If every time increase testing raw positives goes without positivity rate going (or many cases smh), actually worse means still behind testing. south behind testing, may lost cause point.

[1] mom parroting thing last night, also loyal Fox viewer. former nurse still thinks ""just like flu"". infuriating. Well, hopefully local news set film drama, sure some. Manhattan Beach take kindly this, past videos non-mask wearing folks shown.

There's ""shit"" there's ""*SHIT!!!*""... I'm referring hospitalization demands morbidly high, like 3x 20x hospital capacity. I'm referring maybe 70 million simultaneous active infections (official unofficial). 

Brazil probably 4 million 10 million active infections right now, could conceivably mid-August. Brazil's testing numbers incomplete, states provide all. Brazil's new cases since June 30th (600,000) larger reported active cases officially (571,000), states reporting zero tests, total number tests positive case percentage hard gauge. hospitals fill regions probably distance response, guess numbers dying home streets be... minimal? non-apocalyptic anyway.

I said ""some schools US have"" i.e. many under-funded schools poor neighborhoods. 

You also comparing countries whole Netherlands twice size NJ. limited population population density many cities US has. many classrooms Netherlands 30 students?

For example, [California averages 35 children per high school novel flu strain like Swine flu yes summer flu season would common. Regular flu strain vaccines great comparisons compare novel virus to. two articles last novel flu (Swine flu) spreading summertime one Spanish flu

 

 

 

Overall severe summertime flu season rare. mainly happens new strain flu one immunity to. COVID-19 also new virus many people immunity to. Yeah let drop tens thousands dollars pay legal fees case may even win

Not everyone afford sue whoever want 100% positive want misspeak say had. Appreciate info good news know even countries ready roll. trained, dog ""test"" metric fuckton cases nurse day Seriously, parent school aged children know rampant illnesses spread schools spread parents workplaces. Schools local epicenters spread illness communities. Opening schools probably worst idea anyone suggested yet pandemic, right along 'herd immunity' crowd. town advertised OSHA hotline could call businesses complying COVID regulations. called report local business publicly refusing serve anyone wearing mask, spoke woman redirected standard complaint procedure via website.

I confused apologized, saying impression hotline. sighed told ‚Äúit *was*‚Äù overloaded reports couldn‚Äôt juggle it. rarely see people mask go store USA testing 20x people every day Canada. That's good!

The USA recording 200x many positive cases every day Canada. That's bad!

But positive case comes free frozen yogurt, like call frogurt! media terrible, sides. highly suggest research, using media primary news source unreliable cards? cardstock? laminated? actually get one mail? think everyone knows total bullshit, get actual card bullshit it?

Thanks concern haha. mentioned make point people need get used it, that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs excuse wear one all. Besides, someone worried mask suffocate shouldn‚Äôt go outside all. virus definitely lot harder lungs mask ever will. Great. wear go volunteer hospital atleast paramedics? cases surging, need extra hands guys think hoax anyways.  sad part is, probably family members Coronavirus likes this... think republicans defund education every given opportunity? Smart people don‚Äôt vote them. believe, would wish, left free market.

Anyone wearing mask reported insurance company, risk re-evaluated, premiums raised insurance dropped. Simultaneously, denied public health assistance, helping adhere beliefs.

Bankruptcy courts remain available them, fee, nothing free. ask pope worked .... lol Right? I'll streak governor's lawn gets lockdown. think, truthfully, numbers look inconceivably big people understanding percentages hard folks don‚Äôt know many zeroes billion vs trillion.

Countries pretending low new cases weeks they're clear wrong, they've always wrong. re-open they're like ""should shut back down!!?!"" No, smart. issue US many places opening back intelligent manner precautions masks. Shutting going anything delay inevitable, select hotspots think shutting get cases control, country?

Stupid clich√© people realize situation like half measures bring partial results? Either go get Rt less 1, virus spreads wreaks havoc. population density deceiving 3/4 land unpopulated. Given context (February, post discussing differences media reports covid) believe means journalist China interviewing Chinese girl China safe, wear mask, wash hands often sanitize stuff bring home. exposed little little getting vaccine? never sick notice weeks little manic usual couldnt remember things well never got sick even point coughing fever. Maybe dodged maybe whole family exposed slowly developed antibodies. I've working since start convenience stores big chains there's way never exposed it. maybe I'm super careful. maybe state right thing kept (most) people home everyone else wearing masks. (Northeast) large, OSHA often show someone dies. *might* see severe injuries reported, absolutely guaranteed someone dies job.

There's handful - 5, max - OSHA inspectors state. such, businesses stay within guidelines...but likelihood one showing - even violations reported - relatively slim.

If someone falls ladder, splits head open dies, they'll like flies shit. death rate low soon, really low even. get whole lot worse

It's like standing train tracks see light coming yet say ""Look, standing train tracks safe!"" Sorry Mr_985. Stats don‚Äôt play well here, don‚Äôt fit people‚Äôs narratives half people either aren‚Äôt smart enough don‚Äôt take time understand them.

If deaths causes 44k expected number 52-54k... that‚Äôs large gap. I‚Äôm sure exactly what‚Äôs accounting gap since Covid recently went roughly 550 deaths per day (3850 per week) 760 per day (5320 per week) Covid deaths increased reasons deaths causes decreased even greater rate. 

That‚Äôs facts. Anyway I‚Äôll take downvotes breakfast move now. Woah elite libs called off, hoax! /s OSHA underfunded years. can't possibly handle COVID complaints too.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) crafted measure ahead negotiations Democrats next round coronavirus legislation. proposal, White House reviewing, temporarily offers schools, businesses, health-care providers nonprofit organizations legal protections people allegedly exposed coronavirus sue them, according summary seen Wall Street Journal,
Under proposal, defendants cases would held liable didn‚Äôt make reasonable efforts comply public-health guidelines instead demonstrated gross negligence intentional misconduct, according summary. defendants would right move case federal court choose, offering potentially favorable alternative state courts.
Why Another Coronavirus Stimulus Package May Tough Craft
Congress eager pass next phase coronavirus stimulus legislation, bipartisan spirit present months ago may frayed parties weigh differences. WSJ‚Äôs Gerald F. Seib explains. Photo: Eric Gay/Associated Press
For coronavirus-related personal injury medical liability cases, plan also sets clear-and-convincing-evidence burden proof, places cap damages, heightens pleading standards.
The protections would backdate December 2019 last 2024, expiration declaration Public Readiness Emergency Preparedness Act offers liability immunities.
Mr. McConnell months said expanded liability protections must included fifth coronavirus relief package, lawmakers begin negotiating next week return Washington. Republicans, Democrats, White House also need resolve differences enhanced unemployment benefits, another round stimulus checks reopening schools, among issues, talks.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going put bill floor Senate doesn‚Äôt liability protection it,‚Äù Mr. McConnell said event Kentucky Wednesday. ‚ÄúThis would protect hospitals, doctors, nurses, businesses, universities, colleges, K-12, everyone dealing coronavirus acted good faith.‚Äù
The legislation Messrs. McConnell Cornyn also shields employers lawsuits arising coronavirus testing workplace agency probes steps took comply stay-at-home orders. Republicans also want limit liability new types personal protective equipment equipment meets certain federal standards.
Business education groups, including School Superintendents Association, urged Congress pass new legal protections ease risk lawsuits schools businesses weigh whether reopen. U.S. Chamber Commerce lobbied temporary liability protections say ‚Äúwarrantless lawsuits‚Äù companies follow law reopening.
‚ÄúWithout temporary liability protections many American businesses face daunting choices closure, bankruptcy, reopening risking business-crippling lawsuit,‚Äù said Neil Bradley, executive vice president chief policy officer Chamber.
The proposal Messrs. McConnell Cornyn face Democrats skeptical expanding liability protections. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif) said Wednesday Congress bolster protections workers, employers. Democrats previously sought strengthen Occupational Safety Health Administration rules pandemic.
‚ÄúI think important way protect workers employers customers clients businesses, well, strong OSHA provision legislation,‚Äù Mrs. Pelosi said. unions also said oppose expanding liability protections businesses.
According litigation database kept law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, 3,500 lawsuits involving coronavirus filed across U.S. since January. Roughly 300 cases deal labor employment issues, 240 touch consumer issues, nearly 200 relate education, according firm‚Äôs database.
Several states adopted measures expanding legal protections health-care providers businesses pandemic. survey conducted June Public Opinion Strategies showed 80% respondents support new law shielding businesses, schools, organizations Covid-19 lawsuits.
The American Association Justice, lobbying arm U.S. trial lawyers, opposes plan give broad liability companies. Trial lawyers say state laws already shield companies lawsuits unless act ‚Äúunreasonably‚Äù operating.
‚ÄúThe reason don‚Äôt support corporate immunity current law already protects companies right thing,‚Äù Julie Duncan, director federal programs organization, said.

If recall, started experiencing huge surge deaths days realized community spread. poor testing time. also densely populated city entire country, spread took much quickly. taking much proactive approach many states experiencing current issues.

Florida bunch states (and still are) largely ignoring problem really started take month ago. percent positive total cases diagnosed trending upward long. appeared lower death rate. partly Florida catching cases much earlier due improved testing. also partly treatments improved. 

Despite fact improvements treatment testing, Florida still looking pretty bad. increased hospitalizations deaths. still squarely middle pandemic, hard compare death tolls two separate areas. 

You really wait see final outcome declaring New York bad compared rest country. would personally agree original poster's comment would better New York Florida time. Please provide source Japan‚Äôs healthcare workers trouble getting PPE Japan encouraging public buy masks. I‚Äôve never heard case.

I'm 21 taken seriously. Copied TLDR paper

# Conclusion

* Children appear significantly less likely acquire COVID-19 adults exposed
* reasonable evidence significantly fewer children infected community adults
* Children rarely index case household cluster literature date
* clear likely infected child pass infection compared infected adult, evidence infectious


The parsimonious explanation seems children less susceptible becoming infected, therefore fewer become infected, subsequently fewer infected individuals community, children therefore infrequently brought infection homes.

**Edit:**

Keep mind, _less-likely_ acquire transmit mean imply absence chance children acquire transmit Covid-19. get away First Amendment. shop towel heavy duty paper towel. lot skilled trade jobs would use them, like mechanics. get online, walmart, home depot, lowes, etc Im sure. google shop towels amazon, theyll look like heavy duty blue paper towels.

Fingers crossed. isn‚Äôt single coronavirus vaccine strain

This factually false. vaccines virus even passed small human trial stage. results extremely promising there's reason think we'll working vaccine within next year. I‚Äôve heard lot people saying high school college football moved spring, honestly makes sense. Let much lower-risk sports like golf tennis go sports you‚Äôre practically guaranteed come close contact someone pushed back. okay, ""kills people mass"" mean?  cares verbiage,  

I do. too. Misusing terms makes look like Cletus Slack Jawed Yokel.  

Oh shit! completely missed username. one well-known trolls sub. probably wrote ""in mass"" purpose suck people troll trap. got me. :-) read KW TripAdvisor forum, everyone insists coming vacation Florida, know safe, DGAF limited hospital resources residents's health. see couple posts cancelling, overwhelmingly coming vacation good time.

Stay fuck home! Going vacation global pandemic, epicenter, maybe Darwin really something! Respect admin lmao ooooh, related doctor must understand medicine. Come on, can't background degree IT. understand work complex information systems daily basis.

Yeah, there's difference professional Googler error messages understanding public health. one. Lmao

I'll point back [this Feel free use understanding complex information systems tell ways studies take account numbers adverse effects seen there. 

Or admit utterly ignorant field nothing masturbating pretending know talking about. Americans (and think English) German citizens around concentration camps come physically bury dead Dachau, etc. call hoax fucking buried dead. worked. call Covid hoax, bury dead. No, re-examining pneumonia deaths would sufficient. Please see addendum of: must disagree. think sort attitude built American psyche. sort 'screw I'm going want do' mentality.

If read history, see many examples kind behavior. late nineteenth century, Kurdish chieftains Anatolia raped Armenian brides wedding night (part known khafir hafir system).[39][40]

In Hawaiian Islands, marriage Western sense exist arrival Christian missionaries; word husband wife Hawaiian language.[citation needed] privilege chiefs often observed, according ""Sexual Behavior Pre Contact Hawai‚Äòi"" Milton Diamond.[41] young girl's parents viewed coupling favor.[42] lucky, might conceive offspring allowed keep it. 

The term also used describe sexual exploitation slaves United States.[43] (See Children plantation.) 

In modern times, Zaire's president Mobutu Sese Seko appropriated droit de cuissage traveling around country, local chiefs offered virgins; act considered great honor virgin's family.[44]

In Epic Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh described practiced similar custom: ""He king, whatever wants... takes girl mother uses her, warrior's daughter, young man's bride.""[6] first meeting friend Enkidu attempt one acts Enkidu manages stop great contest strength two champions. 

Herodotus mentions similar custom among Adyrmachidae ancient Libya: ""They also tribe custom obtains bringing women become brides king, may choose agreeable him.""[7]

When plebeians Etruscan city Volsinii rebelled aristocrats 280 BC, ""They took wives placed daughters nobles jus primae noctis, former masters could lay hands tortured death.""[8] Alternate headline : Stupid person falls cult kills self, world better sounds like read post. right homework criminalized. probation system keep people incarcerated even they've already done something criminal remanded there, like commit assault robbery. ""you juvenile detention crime committed, let stay long things: (homework, nice people, whatever)."" really depends cynical want get. comes fact there‚Äôs denying happening country last four months. There‚Äôs way Trump get away it, yet continually less nothing. cannot feign ignorance this. 

So question becomes (or doing) regards virus? Others already theorized. Mine based fact always angle Trump personally benefit; dictates actions inactions. 

He mentioned previously interviews wanted low coronavirus case counts. why, it‚Äôs theorized believed back Jan high case count would make look bad, hurt economy, threaten re-election chances. went path suppressing numbers, tying directly re-election. Now, may see as, virus spreads scared population is, lower turnout election, helps Republicans (also explains anti absentee/mail ballot, also trying exert control USPS.)

Another theory, probably one put weight on, stands financially benefit virus. way handled PPE situation - holding back public distribution product; seizing inbound PPE; handing no-bid contracts suppliers - indicates either family supporters made money corona continue so. Given inflated prices demand quickly outstripped supply things face masks respirators, HUGE money-making opportunity. 

Another theory Trump thrives chaos; chaos opportunity (see above). Taking bit further, dark, Trump may feel likely lose November, burning everything does. could also be, doesn‚Äôt care anyone except himself. narcissism extends country. cannot give fuck. 

Whatever reason may be, though, it‚Äôs clear inaction cannot chalked ignorance. Therefore, must kind intentionality behind inaction. people dubbed terrorists because? Oh, white. seems educated Americans poor comprehension. technically counts better public health guidance we're getting federal government least public health guidance. Numbers wrong. thing exponential. Given complete inability inconvenienced, I‚Äôm predicting best case scenario 500000. surprised see 1000000. 

At point, we‚Äôve completely inundated medical system, we‚Äôll leave usual numbers behind push 5 million. almost already this. Yeah. Based best understanding right now, seems like (in US) high schools particular stay remote. older ages studies suggest big spreaders, yet still lack frontal lobe development stay vigilant. fit office? suffered insanity?

I looking max cases per day EU hotspots, UK, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Florida surpassed all. fact, Europe whole, 446 Million inhabitants, currently 15,000 odd cases per day ... Florida alone nearly matching *whole region.* Aside socioeconomic causes increased cases mortality among people color, scientists theorizing levels something called von willebrand factor could indicator severe risk. Von willebrand factor typically higher people color people European descent. They're speculating also reason blood types susceptible. Von willebrand factor basically determines body responds COVID destroying blood vessels. Higher levels likely mean clotting higher risk thromboses. quote Step Brothers...

America's pandemic management problem nutshell. people top refuse lead appropriately. many bottom busy, uninformed, unempowered, liability-averse make right call own. 
It's truly ridiculous still debate. Dr. Drosten et al figured kids roughly viral loads back April loads PCR seen laboratories. significant difference children adults. Age categories: Kindergarten (KG), Grade school (GS), Highschool (HS), etc. age ranges (counts). thread ph student points - infected vs sickened. Kids *can* infected &amp;, clearly, similar levels viral RNA (no reason suspect *not* infectious virus) older ppl, likely sampled often become sick often older children adults

Yes. Duh. funny remotely intelligent person point face net face mask count all. Weren‚Äôt already aware this? official mortality rate USA 4%, estimated actual mortality rate .5% less... right would mean whatever official case count is... it‚Äôs minimally 1/8th actual number.

So it‚Äôs two part conclusion. 1. virus far contagious much widespread people realize backed clear fact it‚Äôs incredibly difficult track control. (Evidence it‚Äôs circled globe seems attack population moment make vulnerable) 2. virus isn‚Äôt deadly previously thought tho news long term effects still makes concerning.

So yes, it‚Äôs incredibly contagious disease. Fuck that. Isolate areas, restrict travel parts US keep areas get clear clear.

I'm we're pretty fine right now. fuckers elsewhere want give up, welcome to, want police enforced quarantine plague rat wandering quitter states. course it‚Äôs diverting capacity. think labs would nothing help pandemic didn‚Äôt work sports teams? course would working even solely motivated money. It‚Äôs hands deck testing. feel like one protecting workers whataboutism false-equivalence.

Also employer werw paying unemployment work money would case something happened.

What's reasonable waiting studies done prove masks help significantly, already many there. reasonable wait studies done climate change take action (and long time). 

In fact, really need new studies prove this, I've saying months now. enough evidence know masks help prior COVID ever erupting. even basically admitted [purposefully downplayed efficacy masks US order conserve exactly hypothesized case gilded post linked. 

But Sweden seems like they're downplaying efficacy masks part due cultural sclerosis (the Nordics generally rejected masks) perhaps also want stick herd immunity instead shifting TTI all. sex extortion?

At least, vaccine could prevent people getting severe COVID-19.

The fact violations come hefty fines typically enough spook bigger companies - rather, management teams charge sites could get fired rack many things like big fines - compliance.

For better worse, OSHA (again, state) spends time construction sites things nature. violations typically occur frequency, serious life-threatening mishaps occur often. fact one worst-kept secrets, companies worth salt act OSHA could pop time (and will, occasion) qualms holding manager(s) duty completely responsible violations. would stick peer reviewed journals.

Adults pretty stupid things, class 30 elementary school kids inherently chaotic likely mistakes. Maybe OSHA look Amazon force improve working conditions things like better air filtration PPE. certainly money. Title school, hand, holds fundraisers buy basic supplies kids. Different animals. Thought said humans... U seen pathetic turnout Good. Fake Covid news needs deplatformed ASAP. bad... Interestingly, Canada wearing masks noticeably less Yeah, really classy fact many fracking firms going bankrupt can't pay close holes. US emits additional methane like 1,5 million cars usual would drive US every year.

But still, firms seem pour bonuses shut down. Sweden lower death rate Michigan, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, obviously lower New York New Jersey.

/s could kissing booth somewhere else. beats me. amount useless articles throughout this, ugh. Yes that‚Äôs exponential growth works, infection counts going go daily til peak. Received: August 16, 1998

Old sources always makes sceptical. either case, state intensive care differ countries, thus can't see evidence this. Inadequate testing biggest problem. Republican Governor Hogan excellent OP-ed yesterday. unbelievable bad handled. recent coup Morales especially heinous. hard see organic one biggest points running platform ""I'm going stop CIA firebombing crops"".

Extremely online right people love Pinochet memes, know Henry Kissinger one pressured killing political dissidents. long term health issues due COVID. first rounds data came showing this, military right thing. something talked political reasons. Nope. Look Texas. I've heard waits month get tested Houston. length delay, what's point? 

Also, positivity rates increased nearly everywhere, real telling stat. Yes, testing = *known* cases, people getting tested, higher % testing positive. But...they could wear mask? would give control lives reduce personal risk catching Covid19 60%.... Stupid people spend money stupid shit. Whodathought? identify guy never sexist entire life earth today? 

What asking akin asking German people responsible Nazis even though didn‚Äôt directly kill others. Yet supported never stopped did.

Stanley milgram illustrated devastating realization Americans susceptible passing blame authority maintaining status quo even means killing someone. 

Every man every women alive today culpable live society hates women weaponizes femininity hate destroy men.

Feminists love men. Feminism core fights gender equality. Feminism fights end injustice men well women.

You get upset something someone posts online girls get death threats playing video games, going school standing sexual violence. know meant say job clarify things remove ambiguity big fail have. ""You build that"" moment anyone expect opposition media capitalize paying attention decade. Especially admin probably one worst twisting words others context.

When job remove doubt get less benefit it. childish. knows maybe they'll use guinea pigs make sure actually works.  six. I‚Äôd love sports come back man, would nice break. really don‚Äôt know long term impact people. Would rather everyone sit year make sure they‚Äôre exposed anything impact long term. Ultimately players, think league probably cautious. Sigh. article doesn‚Äôt explain pandemic mortality rate is. Also, nobody saying thousands people day dying. 24,000 - 60,000 per year according CDC. figures include excess mortality. maintain comparability inflate Covid deaths excess mortality also. gives past three months much death whole year worst influenza epidemic month, two years average influenza death per month.

This flu. 7/14 Dallas County(TX) 71% hospitalizations 34% deaths age 65. That's working age, often may choice whether exposed. what's June/July 2021 shaping look like? estimates/predictions future? ‚ÄúYEAAAAH!‚Äù fat gamer virologist fatwhale ! Yes don‚Äôt blame sports. Blame institutions ensuring everyone gets fast test results. Well dont think thats true all. That's fair, suppose. I'm OC people absolutely fucking psychotic masks. hospital saw daily drive-by screamers, way describe them. Yelling valet attendants they're ""hiding something,"" release ""the real data.""

If hiding anything, minimum wage front line workers going stay quiet pennies. security officer run place, I'd first whistleblow thought something fishy.

Nope. friends got sick instead. Fuck anti-mask assholes. Agreed, number couldve much lower theyd acted sooner.

However disabled unit coming criticism doesnt make whole lot sense given vulnerable people likely die common knowledge made clear start. LOL, ads many anti-maskers people scoffing social distancing Calgary. think headed real trouble get heads asses. Science says jump 150 tower concrete sidewalk below, hit said sidewalk 66 miles per hour likely die. science stand way testing theory. don‚Äôt need explain there‚Äôs video sympathy. asked it.  longer emotional energy try talk people preaching nonsense. Hey! I‚Äôll know read! mean, it‚Äôs FB scare posts, dammit, read! Why? thought pushing hydroxychloroquine narrative? enough get elderly cancer patient sick? so, hard pass house. complaints sub Solar panels trailer. *No laws not* poorly written article minimal citations back statements. That's opinion piece. 

""A pandemic defined ‚Äúan epidemic occurring worldwide, wide area, crossing international boundaries usually affecting large number people‚Äù. classical definition includes nothing population immunity, virology disease contradict said recommended masks understood people without clear symptoms could easily spread it, waited confirmed order avoid shortages. Presiders governent general men make money women, they‚Äôll continue work (and maybe even work harder they‚Äôre sole breadwinner house). 

Therefore dad‚Äôs careers continue grow mom‚Äôs careers take serious hits.

This isn‚Äôt feminism anything like that. It‚Äôs mostly like impact families really happening? Sorry :/ Good thing know like 30 people. Amber Turd going forward please. pet name dirty cow took shat next noggin sleeping. [The 7 day trend Arizona's deaths hit new time high we're nowhere near peak yet (probably 10-14 days out). Arizona 2-3 weeks ahead Texas Florida surge. Point being, much misery yet come article nonsense. experience personally don‚Äôt know anyone voted either one. I‚Äôm super popular person knows lot folks based sample size say it‚Äôs fault pretty good point share people still deliberately deluded enough like, ""Look can't total shutdown need isolate problem areas quickly shut contain virus. I'm Ohio Florida, kids go back school!""

Like fucking *everywhere* horrible. Every single US state danger zone. catastrophe levels others impending catastrophe levels. American, ‚Äúuntil notice‚Äù. don‚Äôt deserve privilege. don‚Äôt need risk. Ok, however CDC wrong revising downward since beginning this. overly conservative posted number truthfully, it‚Äôs accurate estimates.
I‚Äôve seen estimates low .25% honestly think may range.

For reason people WANT believe mortality rate 2% something, even .25% leads scary death tolls nationally worldwide. 

Anyway, saying CDCs posted number isn‚Äôt reality, it‚Äôs conservative estimate they‚Äôve continued revise month month. like while, Californians moved reporting it. niece turned one. love pieces. seen exactly since March - mask on, six feet away, hour. much wish could snuggle play her, could never live got sick. family members don‚Äôt feel same, clearly don‚Äôt understand serious and/or can‚Äôt put child‚Äôs wellbeing ahead emotional needs. Hah [FDA says . 

Ya find ‚Äústudy‚Äù huh? Show then. dude younger me. Every time see poor bastard die around late 30s early 40s, get even nervous. like sign says take fucking seriously. wear mask, ditto wife kids. see people high risk groups wearing giving fuck anyone else around them. There's going another round lockdowns. ship sailed coming back. Governors blew political capital first round lockdowns actual strategy. can't tell people put lives hold indefinitely expect still lockdown four months told ""YOU MUST STAY HOME CAN'T ANYTHING"" nothing's better off. Enforce non essentials still think entitled. feel way. wish one else would die Covid, they're going to, can't people like this? capable understanding self interests also interest included society live in. Expanding idea family include non-blood, non-familial humans would serve safety well being. Business owners seen mosquitoes capable understanding profit cash hand. one wants defeated.... Sure they're neurological problems, average person say, example, ""caffeine gives neurological problems"" they'd say ""caffeine gives headaches"". think deliberate fearmongering media's part.

I agree need emphasize dangers virus, misleading wording give credibility media. makes people distrust even more.

And yes, severe side effects coronavirus, extremely rare. chance getting one side effects statistically insignificant. Call is, though. refer headache insomnia ""neurological disorder"" clearly shows motivation: Causing needless fear panic. way. Cases stabilized going states. grow cases, going down, stabilized think getting murdered, okay fight back EVEN THOUGH covid. 

Which people photograph imminent danger killed?  Unfortunately dont fucking choice, black community ask targeted way soooo

I problems black community protesting. scientists, doctors, media types pretend protests effect spread covid, problem. Something something pizza vegetable kids eat enough vegetables. Wait HHS work magic numbers soon enough. first last play little game. Whenever see idiot posting check see subs post in, 99 times 100 post subs post in. must exhausting dumb are. It‚Äôs amazing it‚Äôs even possible. Nah, sorry. I‚Äôm trump defender looks like woman might poisoned husband fish tank cleaner think already received platelet enriched plasma antibodies?! ones I've seen contract tracing saying kids primary vector family (i.e. ones bringing home families). also, done children likely around bunch people without parents. I'm going go with, probably depends live. live predominately Hispanic neighborhood, see mostly Hispanics wear masks. go work yeah, white owner 60's mindset flu.

I think media highlights white folk anti-mask. fully believe anti-mask mentality stretches across races socio-economic levels. makes huge problem. Look many people wear seat belts even though law. 

The ""I want thrown clear"" fans. It‚Äôs bullshit. feel like point I‚Äôm sitting around waiting get it. it‚Äôs bad hope hospitals near aren‚Äôt overrun time. Walgreens? Starbucks? Winn Dixie? Albertson's? Vons? Piggly Wiggly? Yea unhealthy mindset it. sure care much people making unemployment. think friend really bad example skews me. fucking ADHD symptoms too.

Yes, difficult. point impossible manage least *attempt*. girl even attempt sounds it. literally race, community. Makes sense fight virus travels community-transmission focusing first hardly-hit communities first. happens America still heavily segregated community, unfortunately. luck though, guess somebody needs underpaid person can't find anything else somewhere something.

I clue sentence means. Rephrase. besides quite millions people ask, feel now? lasting symptoms/effects? long ago this? Faux News la! attitude! admitted downplayed safety impact masks early shortage available masks

Right. downplaying. valid reason. Worse, masks, US going panic buying phase buying role toilet impossible. Ozarks, Branson, Branson. But, really, Ozarks gorgeous. die for, it‚Äôs incredibly pretty area. pretty terrifying seeing nurses walmart masks, masks pulled nose. Lord help us all. agree. Obama‚Äôs greatest failure allowing full investigations imprisoning involved. No, Straits Times basically state media. Unofficially practically state media country low press freedom.

And no, CNN reliable source beat beat brunette... true, union tied contractors union shown scary stuff. Primarily wheel stop turning, dont try stop get run over. added U.S. ""outlier"" among western nations terms getting kids back school

Yah, we're also outlier among western nations terms 70k freaking cases yesterday. So. said interview people wore masks indicate disapproval him. 

It doesn‚Äôt get political that. 0.26% went 0.65% last week, better matches rest world saying obviously opinion, (again SITUATION) could name dozen reasons feel safer kids school limited basis self made group. 10-ish kids kids enforced rules, isn‚Äôt larger risk different 10ish people around without rules (with parents don‚Äôt trust) also structured educational environment/opportunity ask teacher questions. Again, conclusion come situation. close friends families felt could trust? would likely draw different conclusion. That‚Äôs reality us right though. Physical health wise would rather home 100% time, taking measured risk overall well something need get comfortable with. things change area cases start rise exponentially, clearly re-evaluation necessary. 


I don‚Äôt think takes rocket scientist realize year isn‚Äôt going much better last half last year regards learning new material, that‚Äôs point. School much book knowledge (and zero concerns kids level knowledge). social/emotional needs something currently better options fulfilling though. 


So yes, stand statement putting school one day week dangerous overall keeping home placing irresponsible parents. However, can‚Äôt imagine would work younger kids frankly, I‚Äôm jealous parents young elementary school children navigate educational decision making year. keep respond so... useless term.

Take special kind evil participate bullshit. You‚Äôd probably guaranteed enough violations keep inspector busy fraction numbers Fairly certain Americans allowed travel Mexico tourism whole system messed up.


We hear reason schools need open parents go work children's emotional well-being, valid points. 

However education seldomly even mentioned. Society abusing schools childcare pandemic exposing that. case white 15 year old jailed missed homework dozens hundreds people saying deserved it? One would call fair? Sure, absolutely make new post, post sub ,and lets see response be. Ill take notes 41, literally gen x, blaming people 5-10 years younger problems created boomers. business getting bailed boomers. happens every generation.

I'm 40 entered workforce right dotcom crash 9/11 recession, started getting recovered 2008 hit, slow recovery now. 100% great point AGMP

You need negative pressure room use NIV, either room house multiple people cpap sustain negative pressure, don't. fair there's many things disqualify service. Even anxiety can. Fair enough, much know virus transmission treatments vaccine development comes research hasn‚Äôt peer-reviewed. doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúconclusive‚Äù considered good news.  tie argument two? not, care elaborate? Well shi- reply censored. Alas. Anti-maskers may start care loved ones get sick die. Repeating ""i thought hoax"" get past first year says going take care property. Why? nice. shit floor re-opening schools? Going herd immunity rapidly mutating virus?  Oh yeah, news sources tend completely unbiased free politicizing, know. Oh Republicans don‚Äôt want take away *thier* freedoms, colored, gay, librul folk. I'm point I'm done discussing him. point logical argument, he'll say know going like make assumptions, tell worry much. Basically anything invalidate concerns have, really. unique situation gets exhausting I'm working engaging types conversations all. anything? closing things small businesses fighting *big time.* opened soon fast people willing shut again. clusterfuck here. rioting protesting going on, makes wonder.....

is virus weoponized certain people?

are people going practice safety measures CDC recommends nobody gets sick get vaccine/meds?
what risks taking walk getting popped drive skin color?
will president show goddam humility?

edit: downvote want, dont want city/town turning goddamn Wild West....already places like Portland etc making seem reality. purely political say vote republican coming election voting continue corona dumpster fire? Good OSHA joke. Unless personally know inspector. time companies get tipped come fix problem arrive. Yeah trust god/pastor heal doctors?

Jeebus save, not? politicians need lies feed base keep ignoring virus like liberal media hoax. Article week old aging well. post...they well. Lol agree entirely. Coddling people contributed illness death loved one undermines severity situation.

Yeah, tragic son may accidentally killed dad, tough feelings situation outweigh fact we're middle pandemic thousands infected hundreds killed TODAY. guy alone indifference, that's whole problem. totaly true numbers much worse, like 100 infections detection day get tested cough day. 

Our goverment time time said reason closed schools people wanted it. 
If would let open like sweden(to bad study school infections)

But even low numbers ex found hard dicide sent kid back. end turned fine luckely. 

Stay save there! follow idea, people must first believe virus real harmful. Republicans pushing anti-science misinformation propaganda ages now. outcome unavoidable mindblowing right wing party one strict. center right party strict good results absolutely crushed elections happened week ago. long term immunity know COVID even realistically expect COVID since it‚Äôs fucking coronavirus. 

SARS2 would coronavirus unlike every known coronavirus infection cause long term immunity.

For record, chicken pox parties pretty fucking stupid too. # F Ah makes lot sense. Thanks! forgot say this, either family donated millions certain person may maybe boss. I'm sorry, what? sure argument. Europe 740 million people managed get done afford one dad commission?

This people saying things like ""I'll go get exposed someone covid dont worry it"" brain thunderingly dumb. dont want this. Wait. CIA installed Hugo Chavez Nicholas Maduro Venezuela? we're saying here? America succeeded.

I'm going take issue that, give one reason disagree. successful, every swinging dick world desperately trying get here? We're build wall, cage kids, kinds stuff keep people OUT. take million legal immigrants year is. 

How reconcile America successful people every single part world desperately trying emigrate here? 

As contrast, socialism decimated Venezuela, see people flocking prosperous country. see people flocking China, Russia, India, Somalia....just US.  would people pick unsuccessful nation preferred destination? reading article impression got could tap internet all. woman explains driving around get signal. speed slow can't play video like dial days.

The word phenomenon postmodernism. bad news you: Denmark NEVER fully restricted country Swedes. entire course pandemic, people living Sweden job Denmark (10% workforce Malmo, city 300k people) free cross border back forth. Then, late april, people allowed enter Denmark see boyfriend girlfriend, use Copenhagen airport. 

Also, Danes free come Sweden, many did: holiday, queues 6 hours back border control point. Unless think virus tell swedish danish. OSHA doesn‚Äôt resources deal regular violations. OSHA defunded years doesn‚Äôt resources job.  Except Icu hospitals low numbers patients. know flu. Vietnam War either. using comparisons.

I feel like comparing COVID19 flu seems relevant comparing Vietnam war, unless intention 'shock' people.

Also, flu numbers definitely insigificant, people really bat eye. Looking forward ebola parties 2030s, except 30% kids die shutdown ages ago. Leaders? what, Death? Hey, know math! Watch:

How exactly article define ""internet signal""? sure that's actually valid technical term.

Guess got reinfected? 

I know, bad word. Reinfected. allowed according hive-mind.

**Edit**: Yep, instant votes. People around really like word. Reinfection. Hey people outside NYC struggling too. There‚Äôs still fucking Coke Zero vanilla anywhere. Recent olden times maybe. Standards dropping everywhere past 2-3 years. economy banging! virus become sentient knows infecting woke allies inappropriate. Biden wont help either.  Unless completely grid, privacy. really much hide, bother ton. California woman - arch enemy Florida man Okay, first, article talk two dogs. give lowdown accuracy works, consider following:

Say 10,000 people airport. Let‚Äôs assume percent population infected 5%. means 500 people actually positive want identify. 

A baseline would dogs predicted everyone negative, accuracy would correctly predict 9500 negative cases 0 positive cases yielding useless 95% accuracy. 

Maybe they‚Äôre little better that. Maybe correctly spot 200 500 actual cases, trade incorrectly predict 2000 negative cases positive. accuracy (200+7500)/10000 = 72% accuracy. actually useful 95% accuracy. 

What we‚Äôre missing metric matters more, precision. Accuracy useless without knowing many actual positive cases correctly identified dog ‚Äî difficult don‚Äôt know true positive rate population. 

The way article presented get funding training dogs research metrics reflected so. presence dogs also help people visually see government something giving allusion safety really want people fly again. doesn‚Äôt seem interested cost outcomes.

To add on, general phenomenon detecting diseases. Imagine you‚Äôre using machine detect cancer detects 2000 healthy individuals cancer. example above, means 2000 20% healthy people might go chemo didn‚Äôt actually cancer. important look specific metrics.

Anyways, hopes helps anyone interested performance metrics. dude moron. economy closer real back (dotcom bubble all), earth's environment still oh, say, two decades away beginning unravel completely. we've made modest social progress, yes, lot fundamentals way worse wear irrevocably so. Also, herd immunity pnademic fighting strategy used cows. smarter fucking cows?! really best America? Sure. USA, they'll figure charge 10 20 times much.

And avoid spreading virus lots people touching money taken offering days. start. lest fuel rage Karens anti maskers Lax view virus + varied population densities..

Seems right, though look Riverside County's numbers Riverside city Moreno Valley currently hit hardest. Corona right behind. Interestingly, Norco, Eastvale, westmost community county, Coronita, appear light confirmed cases. Hospitalization data available level though.

You would think areas OC (hotspot) Riverside city (hotspot) would hotspots, hunch people live Riverside proper getting infected work Orange County bringing back via toll road (or way around - both).

San Bernardino County unaccountable mess, difficult make guesses there. ever got around breaking cases cities, seen page - though, admittedly, gave area. Anecdotally, know/work people four counties, monitoring greater area closely can. already several comments referring child, shared adult. 

People trying figure transmission risks school-aged children, clickbait titles like taking advantage curiosity. 

I‚Äôm making argument reopening schools. I‚Äôm irritated poor journalism. 

Also, even student ‚Äúin college‚Äù it‚Äôs summer break right now. classes wouldn‚Äôt anything transmission. said got friend went drinking got sick. It‚Äôs abc news story. centrists means testing? like moths flame. probably lacks good judgment. 

And, honestly, can't imagine pain must right now. took trip 1-year-old see parents family. son throwing feeling great trip, figured childhood whatever. actuality, highly contagious virus, affect mother much, put father hospital acute kidney failure. weeks told lifelong dialysis strong possibility prognosis. Thankfully, dad took turn better, kidneys healed course months.

But let tell you. never felt devastated guilt thought carelessness could put dad permanent dialysis associated loss quality life. imagine kid going through. 

My heart goes him, hope dad recovers soon. fake news! /s made sound like alchohol sales *stores* stopped, isnt true (and would terrible idea). stopping sales restaurants, open serving people anyways places get 11k cases day.

The fact bars open still baffling. still cant sit restaurant here. find useful scale relative things know, people understand scale it. that's OK.

People know example: Reported US Covid deaths running two September 11 attacks per week. 2-3 Boeing 747 MAX8 crashes per day. 4 times deaths per day World War II. Benghazi attack every 8 minutes, 24 hours day.  might find metrics useful, appreciate them. promise: someone does.

I still think flu better metric use, seeing types viruses. I'm guessing reason people like compare flu beacuse create 'shock' value, prefer look data analytically, rather try use scare/shock people. problem set failure made terms probation. done way first place academic difficulties begin with. think falls mentioned unfair conditions probation, sure. read place time, physical place. COVID pandemic continues punish local businesses across America. appears averaging one million unemployment claims week. ‚Ä¶ naturally ‚Ä¶ GOP frantically demanding states open; without overarching strategy, ignoring science ‚Ä¶ damn torpedoes. shows. 

This strategy fail. Why? I‚Äôm guy used spend money local hardware store, restaurant, tavern, coffee shop, nightclub, florist, concert venue, butcher, farmer‚Äôs market, barber. I‚Äôm guy used vacation special corner. I‚Äôm guy hired local contractor upgrade home. 

Not now.

I lost confidence America. COVID surges feel choice hunker foreseeable future. ourselves. leaders bungled pandemic understatement, problem doesn‚Äôt end leadership. citizenry carries much blame, bewildering science-denying fervor, partisanship, reckless ‚ÄúI got rights‚Äù bravado - characteristics pleasing novel virus. are, living sobering version ‚ÄòGroundhog Day‚Äô, dreadful scenes unfolded New York short months ago repeating across nation. 

So regardless GOP demands reopen, reality economy remains closed long reckless people reckless business owners refuse make safety absolute top priority. rather helping local guy, I‚Äôm facilitating ascent Jeff Bezos honorary: World‚Äôs Richest Human. I‚Äôm using Walmart‚Äôs curbside pickup. I‚Äôm satisfied staying home NETFLIX solid. guess local businesses fail, people looking scapegoat, blame me. 

I hit pause button. mean, city ""graduation march"" unhappy school's social distancing graduation plan. around 800 high school seniors walked boardwalk, either social distancing wearing masks.

Crazy things work sometimes. Gotta thing anti masker, ideas I'm sure know, diseases generally effect young children. One well known example mononucleosis, awful disease adults get either mild completely asymptomatic young children.

I'm saying that's necessarily case here, unprecedented concept. temp job suspect something like this. Show up, move truck, place key designated box, go next truck. Supposedly moving construction stuff around would needed next day, never made sense me-- move themselves? isn‚Äôt bad people read title making it. video said mobile testing operation moving place place get spot checks different areas. real shame can‚Äôt get test everyone wants one, like Trump claimed first.  basically blew hammy going fron lock down-phase 4 days. definitely think takes cake. might well said ""you know what....fuck science!"" r/FuckYouKaren Another recent study: Ducks like water Quit giving loser media attention... got deserved. It‚Äôll probably take studies arise 6 month follow appointments people sick March April. start drop people haven‚Äôt taking seriously probably panic... wear masks experts recommended it. true Nordic countries.

What better data have? mean, definitely disability units fault Death disease belief. I'm youngest person work. 25. I've wearing mask since March last week work mandate masks. three people got sick week. We're municipality hundreds thousands employees. Meanwhile, coworkers like ""just visited Florida beaches Vegas man, fun"". üôÑ San Diego would swallowed Los Angeles Camp Pendleton, so, wrong. Masks on, social distancing, etc.

Obviously, know what's happening Sweden. Yes listen experts, experts continously downplayed epidemic considered masks recommendation ""unscientific"" mildly admitting could ""possibly"" ""recommended"" ""certain circumstances""    
This [amateur video swedish [another . recents none covid news.     
How many masks see? ‚ÄúRolling back‚Äù reopening late Texas, Florida, Arizona. They‚Äôre already approaching peak infections, peak deaths follow two weeks later.

We need make mask use mandatory indoors, large crowds outdoors. Reclosing businesses entirely causes unnecessary harm, clear voluntary social distancing important factor reducing spread.

Read thread. It‚Äôs alternate opinion conventional wisdom deserves  know wanst race him... piece shit regardless that.

Are actual racist? Yes.

Is every asshole racist? No. lot hate indiscriminately done purpose since beginning year. It‚Äôs form psychological warfare.

Sick fucks.  guess agree social distancing easier sober, right? wear masks whenever I'm out, still even though area much better, hard believe protects others. government definitely deserve blame extreme lack credibility. Even experts - Fauci, CDC, WHO, knowingly lied faces early telling us wear masks, help maybe even hurt. That's debate, find official statements videos 5 seconds.

That would *enormously* better now. mean ever perfect, think ""the same"" paying attention Trump GOP dismantle federal agencies last 3 1/2 years. Trump, OSHA lowest level inspections 50-year history economy grown, two point out.

Source: two bonus articles sides shit, Democrats lots flaws, lightyears better Republicans. vote November, VOTE DEMOCRAT. fuck, one guy video said requirement wear mask ""Hitler type ruling"".... many people stupid ? emailed OSHA question couple weeks ago. emailed within week letting know CalOSHA Enforcement would contact within two days.

Love brothers sisters come together kick thing‚Äôs butt. Go team purple?!? Yep came see/ask same. feel like long *most* people comply, still much better requiring masks.

Here's Orange county's case/death chart, running 7-day chart Los body get desensitized need higher higher dose quit cold turkey **Sets Wave Karens Threatening Boycott** 

Good, let them. highly doubt completely forgo shopping Walmart. Making less 30k full time jobs indentured servitude. Damn yall pay 0 taxes checks? yall file taxes all? article vague misleading, clearly political.

‚ÄúCan they‚Äù dramatically different question ‚Äúhow often‚Äù.

Asymptomatic spread remains unproven, fact alone end masks lockdowns. 

Finally data schools opening throughout rest western world without problems completely omitted. study even test everyone covid?

Edit : yep lol actually +2400 month. +600 week beyond unemployment. guys think family member flying home NY CA quarantine? brother returning home spending two weeks upstate NY move apartment (I know friends place time). flying LAX think completely reasonable ask get tested shelter airbnb days gets results since coming family's house 4 people strictly quarantining 4 months. parents seem think unreasonable/paranoid can't help feeling worried 4 months sacrifice stringent measures nothing brings COVID home. thoughts and/or sources supporting whether quarantine? Thanks. re-infection / immunity / latency questions important ones now. notice never claimed spread COVID. also say anything ""wealth"". yes, agree things could do, actually them.

Edit: clear, I'm talking ""experience"", I'm talking fact schools lot kids, stable environment have. Sometimes decent meals get. School nurses sometimes medical professionals see. School counslers sometimes mental health care get. We've made schools often social safety net kids get, without it, come real, physical harm. elimination person education going make pediatric healthcare disparities rooted racial economic inequalities worse. may well things outweighed community health risk COVID, very, real risks talking enough, talking them, nothing going done address them. lol. love evidence present. 

Edit: want shut ability rational discourse. willingness adapt come together solve problem rather die red blue hill.  top comment. think going prior events scale considerable public engagement eager participation. World War II transformed entire economy, put women work, redefined family, rationing, austerity, war bonds.

And can't get people wear masks.  Yep, admit dumb I'm lazy go MD shot trust grocery store tech sanitary enough put needles me. sign get Oxford shot? relax, dudebro? 
Americans what's needed. They've already proven it. feel free relax ventilator :) also get more.  It‚Äôs frightening lax Americans getting. seems like people know (not anti-mask MAGA folks) deluding thinking it‚Äôs going back normal life, despite faced overwhelming evidence contrary. 

It‚Äôs like sort mass psychotic episode. They‚Äôve decided can‚Äôt take social isolation anymore they‚Äôre going go back normal. It‚Äôs going effect us acknowledge pandemic too. Soon national viral load impossible dodge. We‚Äôll sick.

Sigh... **How many people see using n95's?** 

Water molecules probably order 1000x smaller virus. mention cannot get perfect seal n95..... like surgical mask me. Can‚Äôt wait open schools thrust lifetime trauma upon kids end infecting parents/grandparents. wear mask courtroom. 

  Judge permission approach bench. 

You're free go. It‚Äôs mask. It‚Äôs inability follow rules, simple directions. acted kids adults caved gave wanted. They‚Äôre grown, still use childish response hopes achieving want. I'll keep fingers crossed... Trump dismantling country again? Didn‚Äôt China this? phase three equivalent basically injecting military. shut Virginia early part April PPE became difficult find. got call last month see wanted back schedule (wrecked knee repair). politely declined. idea 8 weeks PT. CrINgE.  I've done people constantly sweating breathing, lol. Stand firm. They'll piss moan pitch fit, they're used told ""no."" reporters let in. understand saying. Also cannot flood hospitals news crews. Theres also patient confidentiality concerns. I'm sure done though. 

Also report outside hospital, show traffic coming in. Interview people leaving, workers leaving. Testing sites ground level instead articles saying ""lines long"" picture traffic. Interview people waiting cars 8+ hours, interview taking tests, bad feel. 

All really getting though felt like better coverage past wars happening foreign soil happening right home. really needs change. Whether Congress needs get involved get news crews access need inform public... idk. seems like lot could done. people waiting 18 weeks without payments Oh makes sense. thought meant deploying soldiers stand guard hospitals word shattering longer shocking. Obliterated? There‚Äôs way play wear mask time. might safe play practice outdoors far away one another, outdoor stages big enough accommodate setup.

Since virus fucks lungs, attempt try without vaccine could result never able play wind instrument again. One person infected considered outbreak. work hospital, would sign work 3 weeks on, two off, showing hours shift. Everyone wear PPE, protects patients best ability given circumstances. 

Again, ""outbreak"" declared, mean babies infected may find argument compelling, absolutely argument made individual risk child COVID outweighed health risks staying home, simply risks kept away school higher frequency based know. hospital we've 400% increase pediatric psych admits, we're seeing non accidental trauma usual we've completed pediatric suicides past three months 12 months prior that. And, exception completed suicides, kids reaching help someone cares enough seek medical treatment. lot kids fine can't go school person year two, lot kids stable homes might be. I'm saying answer send kids back school, I'm saying can't close schools without acknowledging going cause different kind harm least trying address it. Well incredibly fucked up. Optimistic. Cases maybe. deaths going skyrocket. Hospitals full cases control. Abbott said one week ago deaths reported late may. Cases 1-1.5k, we‚Äôre seeing consistently 10k now, today 15k. Congress flooding every home every non-millionaire family money.

How keep local food places open this? Give everybody stupid amount money get takeout delivery.

How keep people paying rent? Give rent checks stay home.

Etc. Michigan ways along, people understand data, choose understand it, misinterpret it. 

I would see FB ""The site says 10 cases today, thousands?"" people either symptoms know date onset got results today. Oh, that's unfair... took YEARS ban T_D. I‚Äôll take Cape Fear Valley see one Alamance Regional. Interesting. articles that? keep getting coronavirus information search. anyone ever even think kids *couldn't* spread it? falsehood even come from? Kids KNOWN disease vectors! there's kind virus bacteria all, assume kids rats spread it. Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'll say, r/coronavirus r/coronavirusUS riddled misinformation. 

Thank bot pointing out. Lol ;p don‚Äôt see find it. social security get $890.00 month people get unemployment plus $600.00 making sure consistent. I'm familiar enough say states

Take Connecticut, then. 3.5 million people, dense cities, Hartford metro area like half population Stockholm metro area. rich, liberal, New England state money better healthcare US average. hard lockdown, still locked Sweden is.

Their total death rate per capita **twice high** Sweden.

If Sweden newsworthy ""disastrous"" coronavirus strategy, hell Connecticut's? 

But get pass, numbers lower NY NYC, everyone simultaneously shits on, they're handwaving away numbers reference population density NYC. Connecticut's numbers always gets baked US national average, disappear news. Noone cares ""disaster"" unfolding New Haven. Florida's latest case/death second chart launch profile orbital rocket. graph 7-day running average deaths Florida. Makes sense. neighbors hardcore anti mask understand them. Several months ago report person Iceland. two distinct variants virus body. absolutely clear evidence multiple infection events. Yes want forgive 100% PPP loans too, ones meant small business mainly went big business.. rich ones benefit next round stimulus. Hire biker gangs security No. based science. STONKS mean guidelines buried political reasons. Science inconvenient. fine helps produce things like cell phones heart medicine, tells us uncomfortable things reality ruins everything. 

Gosh darn science! can't stick making new toys let us live short, miserable, brutal lives? know bad chronic illness be, know impact economy. economist working scientist would able grasp though. 

I mean disparage importance virologists, absolutely essential. point instead, whole picture, leadership needs incorporate array experts create good plan.

Here's example. Virologists course recommend people wear face mask. anticipated social rejection face masks. scientists experts would needed understand need specific message, media campaign, outreach, etc convince people masks solution need wear one. sympathy me. now. protested masks, shutting down, social distancing, etc. GameStop made mandatory I‚Äôm working TV production right now. know several studios, including animation studios, also resuming productions. considered essential workforce remain open. right wing party wants strict, Trump took over. November feeling see lot right leaning governors responsible thing contain virus. read comment thread care understand, like said above. I‚Äôd like imagine average subject considering it‚Äôs multiple degrees made great career of. one pressured killing political dissidents

SARS-CoV-2 tough gets cells. pretty sensitive that. know Problem US data integrity accuracy suspect.
Would like cautious thing keep border closed vaccine US actually get point masks.
However, I'm sure Agent Orange push open border shitty epidemiological data. Sure, called tongue cheek. pointing education equal common sense equal intelligence wisdom.

They're different things. 

A PhD tells educated, that's it. One thing note NY NJ wayyyyyyy cases Florida Arizona. testing. Would interesting see deaths hospitalizations consistent across time think things happening slowly people scared. like slow-moving tsunami, people looking Windows seeing coming commenting fucked neighbors realizing coming straight them. Valve masks dumb intended purpose (preventing inhaling dust, making exhaling easy). covid protection nothing like masks' intended purpose. Technically didn‚Äôt. lost popular vote nothing new tho, regardless wether blues reds white house.  ""...my bad"" really really hope they‚Äôre sarcastic...  pathetic yourself.      
Either seriously little bit both. case plain ignorant. People like real responsible pandemic. wish national guard could deployed everywhere enforce nation wide shelter place. essential workers could managed delivery food essential items. 2.5 weeks mess least brought greatly control. half ass measures waste time cost us much money jobs long run. need end pandemic. everything else bandaid buying time (or wasting time) us so. Thanks man, secret social distancing masks. Kids germ incubators can't keep hands themselves! thing legislation can't really blocked like that, signals intent pass relief funding legislation. relief legislation would need passed Congress. way around getting majority congress pass legislation.  spreads like wild fire camps,
Tx, Ga, AR, MO close camps 75 children counselors staff caught last weeks. realize that's Congress controlled Republicans. Also, .com bubble would say case. Let's clear here: USA taking things. Trump administration. like behavior, support regime change. can‚Äôt wait Katrina FEMA wealthy subdivisions. Maybe seeing angry pissed change things. I‚Äôm tired never getting help need it. Watching corporations get millions bailouts calling charities get bill paid. one bailing out. One important milestones recovery effort getting Iowa students back school 

No, getting virus control Iowa, assuredly, have. much energy go overcoming that? Fauci basically said masks useless unless hospital. Yes come compromise. Democrats ask continuing $600/mo Mitch come $400 $200+another stimulus check everyone something like that. Mitch said before, Trump practically begging something now. 


It would nice student loan forgiveness table, President shown zero interest helping them, thats probably non-starter. needs happen every single state tbh. US getting almost many cases per day Canada gotten total.

What's average IQ people looking ""cases"", highly arbitrary measurement based number people tested, instead solid numbers like hospitalizations, ICU admissions daily deaths, Reddit?  
 
I figure around 85 could even low 75.

I've seen heard pretty awful things, first-hand, others people held local mental facility transferring juvie. Somehow, though, got really lucky, spared courthouse failing probation. go juvie... *ahem* mean, *group home*. Sadly girl (I'm actually concerned unforeseen consequences years line). 

Seriously, sending away loving mother broke probation homework pandemic? Editing add, Judge Brennan live herself, call child threat community...? impersonal heartless judgment. like judge already itching send child away before. 

Lastly, y'all comments said girl brought herself, like fully understood every inch it, understand pure hell even ADHD, also suffering unorganized (as in, pieces yet) mental illness independent ADHD, finally, right environment stimulus wise. triple messiness girl needed actual structure succeed. new environment give needed, punished -- funnily enough, rigidly structured system.

*Edited make readable Good honey. Keep mom safe years together. point, even ""Economy vs. Lives"" argument hold up. economy fucked things back control. We'll big beautiful timeline well disingenuous, say least. What? Osha's caring safety? Haha. Wait, GOP fighting masks social distancing trying trash Hispanics claiming things? got it. notice ""hot zones"" right Cool! we‚Äôre page disagree minor things, totally fine. agree Kanye. wish great day! even states shut early...are getting new cases going :/ hot weather kills hurr durrr.

Also, travel state state freely without anything happening, that's what's going really fuck us HARD :/ people coming illinois florida shit ugh give quick explanation sars-cov-2 virus human cell.

Scientists even know humans different blood types beyond fact got point, **big** difference understanding virus destroy cells discover *how* provide evidence process. 

But sure sure, claim virus destroy cells *all day long* ....knock outüòè know, even everything goes perfectly, thinks average person get anywhere needle next summer? still testing right yet 4+ months! simple minded individual. can‚Äôt go back work industries completely shuttered. Take live entertainment music industry example. jobs won‚Äôt coming back long time. 17 million people still unemployed that‚Äôs counting people filed PUA. don‚Äôt cut benefit bad apples. worse recession recent history Covid cases time high states rolling back reopenings. time cut people off. unemployment rate lowered virus control sure. However virus keeps spreading, unemployment rate going go up. it‚Äôs worth company saw memo management said mask complaints OSHA still happening. small review article, summarizing peoples work data behind them. common. want judge merit review look sources list. Heh, live small farming community. first people saw wearing masks migrant farm workers. China caused problem. OSHA AWOL. made anonymous complaint addressing serious life threatening work conditions job. response? can‚Äôt anything unless give name identifying information. Which, at-will employment state, would almost lead termination. Blah blah know laws protecting exactly happening, pursuing avenues prohibitively time consuming and/or expensive. 

OSHA exist protect employees. exists protect employers employees. think sick tired horse shit. happening husbands family. really hope sakes recovers. Amazing numbers!

Thanks much. images fascinating. didn‚Äôt realise Rhode Island many cases one point. I‚Äôm glad see we‚Äôre better it‚Äôs frustrating Newport watch many people come state wear masks. residents think taking mask wearing seriously, idiots simply refusing wear one? looks numbers significant outbreak going (it's EU country higher value Sweden right now). said, small numbers skewed.

Here's uncomfortable truth: comes deaths per million, Brazil (360) worse performing SA country, worse one actually Chile (380), country strict lockdown barely mentioned international news ""Bolsonaro bad, Bolsonaro Latino Trump"". boomer funny. 

Not us crazy.

Just us. would listen person got COVID could go private island Bill Gates Clintons harvest adrenochrome somewhere pacific. Thats cover Tom Hanks making movie there! /s Yeah think deliberate. WH knack saying vague things double meanings. happens often accident. 

There crowd wants hear we'll taking faith based approach see science community adversary. crowd already predisposed suspect administration.

People saying CELL like proof great vaccines come, tried remind people virus destroy cells. 

People ordered find links pulled whatever top Google list, people strawman argued forgot virus indeed kill cells. 

You must pardon really care put much energy arguing virus kills cells. 

One thing know virus kills cells another discover prove specifically link provided failed peer review. 

But pointed CELL valid argument many scientists wrong saying vaccines might really provide people wanted to, virus actually kill cells, sorry do. ""Shouldn't based fear""

So based money??? thing scares 77,000 recorded. I'm entirely sure non-insignificant number cases go unreported untested. tell definitely it. first I‚Äôve heard Iowa while. Doesn‚Äôt sound promising.  they're scared getting vaccine, stay home. Yea know CT abnormalities now. know damage permanent studies maybe 5 - 10 years now.

I would assume everyone experiencing level fibrosis thus decreased lung function, especially damage severe enough picked CT scans. necessarily mean functionally detectable however. could example live normally end oxygen tank 60s 70s due prior COVID exposure. simply know evidence real possibility.

What's worse get control people accumulate damage time multiple exposures. No. Anyone joins Military exempted. 18-19 fighting two front war Taliban Jody.

Maybe faith humanity time low, . think something like 40-50% people least even get damn flu shot proven time time safe.

so many useful stooges. many they? thought backtracked new data collection policy. literally nobody praising Us‚Äôs response right now. 

Well, current narrative around US focused southern states seeing rising cases deaths, everyone screaming lockdown again.

But back Connecticut. lockdowns wonderful amazing, work there, compared Sweden? lockdown rich, healthy, liberal, democrat-run New England state still result twice many deaths per capita Sweden?

Now, I'm saying lockdowns useless nothing. something. absolutely questioning *how much* do. clearly, there's correlation severity lockdowns death rate outcomes.

Sweden story, news teams get sent Stockholm, reporters gasping people walk around seemingly uncaring zombie apocalypse apparently happened death rate catastrophic LOCK OMG OMG OMG DARE THEY.

Why news teams sent New report Connecticut lockdown still killed twice many per capita Sweden? Sweden dragged mud outcome, Connecticut ignored?

Oh, right, completely destroys narrative lockdowns Neither Sweden. like sub thinks two options 'disaster' 'awesome'.

I agree, think Sweden's outcome awesome. good. way shape form disaster. sorry genuinely can‚Äôt tell that‚Äôs serious sarcastic remark regards corporations. 

But either way, logic essentially stating ‚Äúwe wrong thing companies, continue wrong thing individuals.‚Äù 

Two wrongs don‚Äôt beget right, even second wrong provide temporary band-aid. 
I get millions folks bleeding, we‚Äôre arguing treat symptoms, cure problem. Company work lost 90% revenue since Feb., reasonable assume fine. Also ‚Äúthe data‚Äù shows aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdriving pandemic‚Äù children SHELTERED demographic since lockdowns occurred. 

One main studies China lockdown. study children Wuhan, recall reading schools China shut down. fucking course weren‚Äôt going see child-to-child spread Dick cheese hands favorite thing call someone sir fucking nailed one.

I‚Äôd like think grow lot person whole thing man...it‚Äôs hard &amp; idea things resemble normal again. called joke. Dark humor. understand confusion, add /s. exactly right. That's study suggesting, multiple factors contributed even deaths due pandemic actual deaths virus. People avoiding emergency rooms perhaps delays emergency response. cost, sadly, even higher Covid deaths. going start seeing places like Florida Texas. seem taking good precautions. doubt exposed monitor symptoms. No, weird. 

I watching Jersey Shore club scene like, ""omg, they're wearing masks!"" realized like, ya know, 11 years ago....ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Hopefully, they'll eventually boycott everything, deal smelly diseased lung snot spewing gaping holes. Wait, that's illegal! Impossible ended Easter comments fake news? think so.

It's entirely possible new cases UK declined next nothing November. Great Britain island screen incoming travellers. individuals still it, scenario could probably control individual cases using contact tracing testing. increased testing She‚Äôs one. Schwann, E-trade several online brokerages reported record new account openings month PUA started sent out. keep seeing people blame young people see videos online people wearing masks mostly older people... parent 2 young kids, really isn‚Äôt big deal. kid fever day two, got better. happened probably 100x two kids young.

BUT NOPE NOTHING SEE FOLKS LIE God, **garbage.**

Every death Georgia going forward criminal liability. 26 deaths Sweden like 853 deaths US.

Seems even(ly bad). doesn‚Äôt depend age. still kill .04% kids whatever made number guys using now. 1 death deaths. Good assumption. totally, otherwise ppl say made up. people morons ! Gov Legislature pass laws? TBH wants please Trump terrified angering him. FL - HOLD BEER - KIDS BACK SCHOOL - sigh. happen? China‚Äôs fault! Obama‚Äôs fault! WHO‚Äôs fault!

Could fun, who's in? America, planning buy China rest world can, complains anyone getting edge. Fuck country.

Good luck Britain Canada, though. made immune shown reduce transmission. Yup. Hanlon's Razor. Never attribute malice adequately explained stupidity US cohesive nation- might well 50 individual countries. That""s get strong state government. want? depends ask. varies lot based geographic location political party.

Part problem shutdowns, masks, testing, scientists, etc. politicized. is, people think danger exaggerated make president look bad.

Part people lost jobs can't pay bills, health insurance rent. Many small businesses (and large ones) means survive extended shutdown. Assistance unemployed set state level parts country enough survive.

And, there's meaningful federal leadership state setting policies. closed hard reopened slowly- others barely closed opened quickly. require masks, others don't. 

I'm NY state we're wearing masks, large gatherings banned, testing contact tracing robust. strong support systems place little protesting reopen. people half states required quarantine come here. 

Personally, I'll trust state govt keep right things vote Trump November. sure much matter- popular vote last time are. ""If science there'd virus""

- _Donaldhino Pumperino_ assume editing prior comment say something like, ""The juvy racist criminal justice system probably wrongly locked 15 year old girl cell, we're never going know sure independent organizations work free wrongly imprisoned people country resources look case""? No, absolutely consensus. even reinfected, rounding error. We're talking hundred cases 3 million confirmed, likely least 30 million actual cases. There's enough worry c19 without hyperbolizing it. No. homework. Says article.

""Sent prison homework""

That's context. Ironic decisive thing he's done coronavirus something. What's strange it? perfectly explainable found one characterized impulsivity tendency experience negative emotions including anxiety, worry, fear, anger, depression sadness, hostility, self-consciousness loneliness. trait associated wishful thinking disengagement order escape feelings distress. Presumably people high neuroticism would tend react pandemic avoidance denial.‚Äù

At first would assume someone high anxiety would careful obeying health warnings, since personality responds fear with, ‚Äúwishful thinking disengagement‚Äù, think we‚Äôve found good description average Fox viewer. Honestly, two people know schools opening masks shit really religious. think them, death isn‚Äôt big deal let everyone get it. would like US 107k cases. evidenced. Antibody tests indicative immune system whole. Unless see studies many people actually becoming symptomatic twice, course... Assuming you‚Äôre referring Trump‚Äôs behaviour. Yes, that‚Äôs think. There‚Äôs difference, truth matters. Trump called stupid incompetence, doesn‚Äôt everyone gets free pass dispense truth make deranged conspiracies. Wow, awesome fellow. going need vote mail fall pandemic keeps up, can‚Äôt go bankrupt yet! People family still saying flu... even though hometown site main hospital area. Facts matter reason (I blame Fox). I'm going assume referring Kemp. Shake hand probably likely Finally: America First! think blame insurance company company charging cost test.... everyone agree?? stonkmarket.com lol get outta When? Not! time wear masks go back work. Must nice. üôÅ thing is, money would flowed corporations anyway...

People would able spend money. herd immunity UK? data 14th buried notes getting updated points document states hospitals required send data rather somewhere CDC use add data sets.

So basically live state readily sharing information, absolutely idea what's going federal snapshot going useless moving forward. Even people think whole pandemic hyped raising eyebrow asking questions hide data?

To me, going states well end going back lock states without outbreaks restrictions place continue spread disease like wildfire.  I'm incredibly annoyed something could handle like good majority 1st 2nd world countries, we're going stretch thing 2021. FUCKIN FIRST PLACE! Yes dumbasses everywhere mate couldn‚Äôt find flour March here. catastrophe scale WWII maybe even Civil War. mobilize war coronavirus. Right now, we're getting murdered. Countries already flattened curve excess deaths last week (like Sweden) currently 99.9% entire population survive pandemic. AHDH.

And original 'crime' got fight iPhone buds, think. Nobody injured. Didn‚Äôt countries? saw Texas, right? Also, midwest checking in, masks rare now. realized haven‚Äôt hearing nightly fireworks anymore. I‚Äôm going start hearing nightly fireworks soon, aren‚Äôt I? Call crazy young adult I‚Äôve never understood mindset invulnerability Death definitely cure yeah, believe it. SPAM pushing website. five minutes since reopened pubs. Fingers crossed, I'm holding breath bit. People acting like exponential growth isn‚Äôt thing. Hopefully don‚Äôt see 2,000 deaths day do, yeah could see crazy shit happening. Sweden‚Äôs population 10,000,000 (.05% died) vs. US population 330,000,000 (.04% died). countries horrible job protecting people. didn‚Äôt shut two months. states attempt something close that. unless together shifts next hot spot around. 3 weeks actual, enforced shut down, virus would burn out. 

But it‚Äôll never happen. Yup watched extended editions least week. Someone give ""deal it"" 8bit sunglasses. I'm untalented incinerator. complete whole process protection. anyone seriously answer question? far tell, literally absolutely nothing. Early around March/April timeframe, clear involved this. could criticize disagree doing, obvious things. briefings, pressuring PPE ventilators, sending emergency personnel infrastructure NYC. 

And then... nothing. heard single thing months. seems reinforced fact every time he's forced talk coronavirus, always replays old shit months ago - banned travel there, made lot ventilators, increased testing. Never anything new, never anything recent (other ongoing support testing, clearly even favor of).

Seriously doing. someone tell me. That's valid reason, still represent me. Oh come *on* man! remember hit 77K cases. Total. whole world. *that* bad. we're *daily* *one country?!?!* watch tv anymore, lets start putting bodies news. Maybe morons fucking get clue. judge thrown jail made complete homework incompetent idiot. trying figure states would able play according rules right Great lesson reading directions, thanks. :) science aware negative results nearly important positive results. There's whole journal dedicated negative results yes, difficult publish, important. 20-30% NEJM trials published equivocal results statistically showing lack significance variables published all. the. time. 40% Americans never left country.

Bygones, reason good people South outclass outvote bad people South northerners can't without moving South. That's voting works. racist northerners besmirch north, work toward ousting bad people power office. overnight thing.

But hot damn, we've made strides. long ago State Mississippi literally ratify 13th Amendment, Amendment abolishes slavery? 2013. That's typo. black second-term President office Mississippi finally performed official process ratifying 13th Amendment legally pronouncing slavery abolished.

2013. maybe ""you"" problem, maybe friends problem, fuck let shit languish 2013? 2010? 2000? 1950? Who? I'll build time machine, need tell decade aim for, idea need talk to.

Mr. Rogers would want. i'm sure Donald Trump looking sell Florida anyone, perhaps trade Greenland. (and throw puerto rico sweeten deal). day, span time. 

Say test positive.

That day, count +1 case +1 test

Your employer needs two negatives come back work. 

They test week later. Still positive.

+0 cases (only count once) +1 test

Then test week later, 2 days that. negative. Congrats, go work!

+0 cases, + 2 tests.

4 tests, 2 positive, counts 4 tests, 1 positive. 25% positivity. one person fact (for purposes seeing many Floridians positive) positive. Thats outside jurisdiction deniers moved goalposts ‚Äúits bad say is‚Äù aren‚Äôt going scared. say hurts economy shut anything down&amp; arent going let affect way live lives That's really concerning.

 idea many deaths takes wake people up. feeling RATE TRAJECTORY scares people absolute number. Remember back March, Italy started reporting 400, 500, 700 days, everyone astounded? Well, long US recording 2,000+ days. couple weeks, people got used ""two 9/11s every three days"". deaths started dipping 1,000 per day, states began reopen. feel deaths rise slowly enough, people acclimatize new 'normal' look way. Texas 30 million people. comparison, Spain 46 million peaked 900 deaths per day. Given Texas, quite sure high number deaths per day needed becomes politically acceptable curtail people's ""freedoms"" rather accept deaths. seem spread much less, community spread low see lot outbreaks schools. there's enough community spread seems significant risk though.

Remember even Sweden, famous keeping everything open, closed high schools. say whether daughter abortion not? not? Gotta right wing judge, competent judge would force city hold convention pandemic.

There‚Äôs big sign local Walgreens says masks required saw 3 people walking without masks on. employees, however, masked. ... people think kids can‚Äôt spread diseases? Like ever seen elementary school? Kids get sick spread shit time think anyone disagreeing you. dudes attitude speaks itself, probably whatever wanted like 2019 again. Well luck, US information could ever want.

Unfortunately want info virus itself, unrelated word ""Trump""... well... know. get along daughter much, ask details. kids told Nana visiting spend 10 14 days isolating ...which really doubt going follow Good Bot. living rock something? whole SEC going red, don‚Äôt mean politics cuz they‚Äôre already red feel sorry them. like warned. Mask wearing compliance really, really low live, despite statewide order, pleasantly surprised today went Wal-Mart. enforcing door, two guys removed mask got inside asked put back on, didn't, asked leave. tried backtrack, associate asked security escort out. hope store leadership (whatever chain work for) starts taking seriously. meantime, thanks right thing, even others aren't. situation =/= everyone's situation. stick dihydrogen monoxide pal.

Like said, stopping spread. seems people Cuba (and lots countries successfully containing virus) higher regard life, respect fellow human beings, willingness make personal sacrifice society. Also, governments willing meet citizens basic needs helps lot. Like, whole lot.

He says paper suggests another mode action ivermectin

CD147 protein red blood cell

RBCs found blood clots
as well thrombin fibrin etc. (?)

CD147 entry point malaria red blood cell


CD147 also considered possible binding site covid19 spike protein

so like ACE2 receptors

however help virus enter RBCs nucleus RBCs

and nucleus, doesnt need ribosomes RBCs since protein synthesis occuring

if protein synthesis occurring, RBCs kind dead end

as virus cannot reproduce RBCs lack machinery virus reproduce ..


however theory goes virus binds CD147 tends make cells sticky

and cause thrombosis .. that's article suggests

article says behavior seen malaria - CD147 similarly ..

saying ivermectin shields covid19 spike protein


and ivermectin prevents happening

(has ivermectin studied malaria ?)


also potentially prevents spike protein binding ACE2 receptor

however huge number CD147 - article hypothesizes ""catch clump"" framework

ie virally mediated binding RBCs RBCs ..

(could reason widely reported ""thicker blood"" covid19 patients, due von Willebrand factor etc. proposed higher doses IVM could yield sharply greater clinical benefits. several clinical studies, IVM doses 2,000 ¬µg/kg, ten times used Florida study, well tolerated. potential major dose-response gains evaluated based upon studies indicating IVM shields SARS-CoV-2 spike protein spike protein binds CD147 transmembrane receptor well ACE2. abundant distribution CD147 red blood cells (RBCs) suggests hypothesized ‚Äúcatch‚Äù ‚Äúclump‚Äù framework whereby virally-mediated bindings RBCs RBCs, platelets, white blood cells capillary walls impede blood flow, turn may underlie key morbidities proposed catch clump scenario COVID-19 parallel malaria, CD147 central infectious process. core morbidity severe malaria caused similar clumps adhesions endothelium centering around infected RBCs. underlie much greater incidence severe malaria blood groups B vs. O, caused adhesive RBC membrane trisaccharides associated blood groups B. COVID-19 likewise much prevalent blood groups B vs. O. generally, hemagglutination, formation RBC-pathogen clusters, common enveloped viruses. hypothesized framework, significantly higher rate capillary flow younger people could explain corresponding decreased severity COIVD-19. proposed hypothesis associated potential major IVM dose-response gains could tested, example, monitoring blood flow COVID-19 patients IVM intake using nailfold capillaroscopy.

Wow. many people infect (and indirectly kill) it, wearing mask?

That seems like information could help encourage others wear mask public. early 20s right I'm counting lucky stars did. easy though, immigration costly difficult. much this.

Good luck sciencing.  American football guilty pleasure mine, home means opportunities catch game. 

I hope cancel season, sake. What, comment murderer? He's authority studies, he's experienced guy drew decades knowledge say masks necessary. There's re-writing history save PPE, bandanas, scarves old t-shirts fine, that's clearly case.

I wear one help panicked FB mom types return society without anxiety, there's visible difference surroundings makes feel safe. Fine, illusion control, it. I'm good guy helps people helps people.

But I'm head-in-sand science denier. Studies mask effectiveness mixed. argument 'hey, we're 100% sure, might help, please wear one', that'd much easier take many people 'the science turned head past three months, wear one scum'. nose test accurate, going you. Feel better soon! Seriously people, stop going test stations! plots look frightening! Enough Okey? want normal life back! could also stop talking that, would great! Oh shit, forgot add /s.... Maga, eat Goya more, please downvote :) feel like people actually watched listened whole thing. 

I found shocking needed see myself. may well bad seems (it surprising everything said done US), feel like may well taken context. 

They say medical experts support idea reopening schools. Now, may lie, I'd imagine medical experts would it, that's see connection quote. 

The phrasing poor, may something like ""the president really wants happen far science supports it"". 

Still dumb, still lie likely, completely different meaning. country probably collapse disintegrate faster Soviet Union Chernobyl... yeah, want know it. Perfect! Maybe finally cull nay sayers. ones fighting hard selfish ignorant, quickly change tune hits personally. Wait, parents? Obviously sane parent never considered this. Tracking epidemiological purposes tracking reporting public interest different matters. comes identifying containing virus transmission sources would absolutely best strategy. disservice public interest delay reporting positive case counts manner.  he‚Äôs onto something? herd immunity reached considerably faster think?

I find really hard believe NY keeping curve flat social distancing. numerous stories young people packing bars clubs. never spoke again, even mobility increasing, doesn‚Äôt least cause question whether guy onto something? Oh yeah sure, ""executive dysfunction"" sure trumps person heaps neurological CNS dysfunction. makes sense.

If that's case, think calibre dysfunction would widespread considering ADHD *everywhere*. bizarre people realize this. people blaming young people poor people think ""millennial"" means college-aged, guess. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get downvoted oblivion what. 

Everything damn county right spun political. Red vs blue. Right vs left. honestly I‚Äôm sick it. People sides damn terrified admitting wrong pull shit like this. 

Bipartisanship split country dang near half. isn‚Äôt much common ground use be. assumed outbreak started Italy.

Btw, get Covid flu time.

Now let's double covid fact lose immunity 3weeks 3months.

Gonna get rough shit ton hard lessons one shit states... we're drowning idiots here. fight masks Georgia nuts. governor actively trying get residents killed regard profits businesses shielding liability. keep insisting flu bro? one wears masks, people wear masks, covid controlled.  number die could reach millions. Fun experiment!! Great craving! think person wrote title already COVID brain Unfortunately, wearing mask probably reason got infected. He‚Äôs probably infected people around didn‚Äôt wear mask. fact didn‚Äôt wear mask even though know virus, means people infected.

This messaging got completely lost clear consistent public health education topic. still two clear facts lot country refuses acknowledge cases people still unaware of:

* carry spread virus without symptoms all.

* Wearing mask protecting yourself, it‚Äôs protecting others case infected. It‚Äôs fundamental political difference America. 

Republicans don‚Äôt see failure federal response don‚Äôt agree federal government control response. 

They think states/local government charge response that‚Äôs political belief everything. 

Republicans (mostly) believe federal government limited power local governments best equipped help local people. 

Therefore issue America cannot due lack federal response believe federal response. believe local/state responses, failure ones dealing it.  people refusing wear masks live people (which lot people CA expensive AF), expose people virus. difference sterilizing neutralizing immunity? I'm sorry WHAT? wonder people like Kemp party can't govern. believe *government*. They've done everything gut social welfare public health, cut taxes wealthy people neglect important government duties privatize indifferent corporations. Coronavirus disaster feature that, bug. Yet another reason I‚Äôm pro-union. individual, little value employer even less government agency. entire trade stands demands basic rights, denied. Texan here: totally cool hate freedumb idiots specifically Governor Abbott, AG Paxton especially Lt Gov Patrick. Well like anyone actually charge programs administration's lack leadership. Even roles filled departments, person chosen background field. symptoms sound awfully similar ""Cedar Fever"" experienced living Austin, TX couple years ago. hope come November people remember whose ideology fueling kind behavior vote it. Still many exceptions (and many folks talk to) liking. border tightened even further. people claiming routine business travel essential flying US isolating get back here. prime idiots there's resurgence, generally control here, they'll blame.

Surgical mask partition reduces risk non-contact transmission golden Syrian hamster model Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) worth studying more

does mask mean mild symptoms?

&amp;#x200B;

**Methods**

We used well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model. placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters na√Øve hamsters closed system units comprising two different cages separated polyvinyl chloride air porous partition unidirectional airflow within isolator. effect surgical mask partition placed cages investigated. **Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens tested viral load, histopathology, viral nucleocapsid antigen expression.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Results**

Non-contact transmission found 66.7% (10/15) exposed na√Øve hamsters. Surgical mask partition challenged index na√Øve hamsters significantly reduced transmission 25% (6/24, *P*=0.018). Surgical mask partition challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission 16.7% (2/12, *P=*0.019) exposed na√Øve hamsters. Unlike severe COVID-19 manifestations challenged hamsters, infected **na√Øve hamsters lower clinical scores, milder histopathological changes, lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression respiratory tract tissues.** True home G-Funk. debating somes friends this.

What do?  set people uneducated / willfully ignorant / belief systems based myths / plain ole dumb.

But infectious virus _that_ deadly certain ages. people ilk roll dice survive. even infect N people die, current laws really allow removed society.

Now sadly, set people decent percentage population. position power voting re-open schools.

Combine (if USA) current federal government filled probably corrupt, ignorant, anti-science, etc. people America's history.

So do? 

What even do?

You really going change minds. really can't force responsible humans. 

November 10s thousands (if more) deaths away. November 100s thousands people getting infected virus looks life long terrible effects.  even January voting November comes affect.

Just commenting silly turned it‚Äôs head completely trust public wearing masks properly asking even craft masks. ""And Oval talking that,"" said.

We've also treated pretty much every Central/South American country like garbage actively worked fuck over, there's also that. Neat! seem reliable news story me. Britain United States share many things, including intelligence, fairly even relationship, defence Britain certainly junior partner. agreement place long time ago giving United States preferential treatment vaccine developed here, not, they've helped us past we've needed it. personally would commonwealth countries top list favours United States behind that, think fair given United States helped us past countries. United States need take vaccine us: preferential treatment agreed months back.

The problem is, natives genetic immunity pathogens, much much MUCH worse cases european pathogens, although also lethal europeans. 

Our bodies never met sars-cov-2 pathogen before.
So develop normalised immunity it, need exposure generations first. Well porn standards she‚Äôs right. room temperature IQ westerners deliberately spreading infectious diseases medical practice Eleventy Billion, nowhere near zillion. unexpected....its even end July yet...

Somebody whip melatonin/cbd chews start making bank. I'm Europe official word here, too, children play limited role spreading corona virus.

 I'm assuming Sweden resources spread students out. even think compare what's going say, Baltimore city public schools. see deal with.

As far I'm concerned, even like 1.1 times likely get infected. I'm super cautious I'm everything power avoid it. Pregnant women 5 times likely hospitalized 1.5 times likely ICU 1.7 times likely ventilator.

That true, never claimed opposite. Seriously, can't fucking read I'm actually writing, could please make bunch straw-men attacks things I've never written claimed?

If look cumulative mortality per calendar year, going get weird numbers, contain deaths two different flu seasons, deaths two, more, different strains flu. know bad latest flu was, compared earlier flus. useful look cumulative mortality per flu season instead calendar year. instead looking deaths week 1 52 single year, look deaths week 40 last year week 39 current year. 

Here's CDC talking flu season deaths: Note they're talking calendar years, reasons describe above, flu season starts October = week 40.

So, going back originally wrote angry tirade straw-men attacks ad hominems inability read actually fucking write: count cumulative deaths Sweden starting week 40 2019, compare similar time periods going back time, Sweden tracking average historical mortality.

We data 2020 yet, can't calendar year comparisons yet, I'm willing bet pretty penny total mortality 2020 Sweden average either. We'll know January next year. I'll remember look message then.

Florida still require masks, even raging epidemic every county. actually surprising see quickly, debate anything outside. conservative government loves following US. hate say, would awesome EMTs take delegates stretchers boring conventions. Listen instead hyper filtering things want hear. read article?

The turnaround time exactly trying improve here. shitty situation, labs already capacity, makes sense think tests priority.

Ideally would massively expand testing capacity test everybody. can't done quickly, find ways make current system efficient. considered breaking kneecaps protect America? happens August 1st? Then, Taiwanese reporter asked Fauci comment Taiwan handling virus, ignored her, said ""we already discussed China,"" cut interview.

FYI, official Canada, Fauci. realize vaccines big pharmas #1 money makers right? Thats push many them, largely untested ineffective. literally spewing nonsense... one uses Cayman islands anymore, fyi... think ways truly effective treatment-one stops people becoming critically ill, helps recover faster- would even better vaccine short/medium term. sounds like monoclonal antibodies could treatment Fauci‚Äôs opinion.

It would reduce pressure hospitals weeks. would also easier manufacture million doses treatments billions doses vaccine months. wouldn‚Äôt anti-vaxxer problem- course people might refuse treatment, doubt would happen big scale people would mostly damaging themselves. also heard lot people anti-vaxxers say wouldn‚Äôt trust vaccine developed record time, that‚Äôs something consider.

reddit place that

reddit designed generate clicks emotions, inform public

don't pretend like choice consume information competent government would control 4-8 weeks ago Yeah, thought made sense long understood doing.

They've recently added ""Reported Today"" section site:

The mobility data thing nonsense. behavior averaged baseline well. lifetime, I'm 35, I've never seen US good guy. Survival fittest.

Without that, hard ally, prefer subservient people's ideas right wrong, would make bad ally you. Oh yeah definitely, meant virus issue more. minutes.

Who's say can't? Study lasted 3 months worried July, August September. 

They seem realize vaccine developed COVID-19 huge risk. 

If vaccine developed we'll wearing masks 2022 2023. fastest vaccine every developed took 5 years.

Correct. Somehow lead exactly wrong conclusion, though. Seriously. One time got home grocery felt little sick went paranoid ""OMG it?!"" mode, one first thoughts ""shit, grocery store, hell's gonna happen everyone store me??""

(I Covid-19, fine. edit: Also, wearing mask grocery people, still, paranoia mode thinking masks 100% effective.) realize much profit is, expensive eviction is. reality probably costs hundred month can't fill unit. Well shit. I'm ashamed American one dead too... Hoooooly fuck it‚Äôs sickness olympics! disorders shouldn‚Äôt used points win argument! Neurotypicals already tear communities, need support other!! know hard deal schooling, shit people problems?

Also regardless, none led **imprisonment child** Seems like China travel shutdown lot good saved many lives. much else could done stop outbreak currently hitting current hotspots. could... great national leadership. know else make sense?

Also every parent time school children day especially jobs busy. honestly think it‚Äôs turned large parties masks distancing. police domestic terrorists. terrible title. makes sound like cities oppose masks. opposite true. governor reversing mandatory mask orders enacted cities. Downvoted.

CNN article much better title: ""Georgia governor sues Atlanta mayor city's mask mandate."" Canada this. Dude, live NYC. cops fuck half time assault minorities hassle homeless people. They're basically military force oversight need put check piggy bank smashed. U.S. government trying facilitate transition away lab-based tests, longer turnaround times, point-of-care tests, provide results minutes conducted wider variety U.S. government expects 20 million point-of-care tests per month available September

Okay fair enough. Yup letter law provide education. 

Anyways, well society basically intrinsically linked presence person schools, let‚Äôs see fall goes. opposite one current conspiracy theories?

Yup. I‚Äôm 36 pregnant stop seeing parents cause absolutely must go lunch friends. I‚Äôm bad guy cutting pregnancy first grandchild. FFS ""Deaths going big deal."" 

Also, ""BLM causing rising rates coronavirus!"" Europe cops patrol warn/fine people social distancing. 

Your cops could try something mild like that, maybe bullet knee something. know article touched in-person babysitter/tutors, think best option terrible situation. Hopefully financial strain lessened government intervention stimulus checks. school days staggered use high school students help extra cash. Keeping exposures low way beat virus beating us every turn. generally avoid using word, woman could called said word - begins c ends unt.

The true answers questions appalling. I, everyone else employed here, terrified speaking corporate can't silence patients. virus killed 100x + people 5 months police one year Door door injections using national guard? Mobilize military help?

Though imagine would go well South. great city (everyone wears mask people work home). can't imagine like live places like Georgia Florida. Chilling think depends state live perception reality totally different. mind boggling. Now... wait theres greater need enough equipment, medication, staff. Bubonic plague caused bacteria Y. pestis, virus Menards early too. grocery shopping online Walmart go Menards buy stuff projects. They're pretty good enforcement too. mean Singapore it. send supplies home stay home. 

Why can't send stimulus everyone buy enough supplies 3 weeks keep home? fault individual dicks talk shit platform. fault creating platform .......why stop ? fault whoever invented internet creating something people like Zuc develop platform dicks scream rubbish ........  Yes florida. stop voting republicans.. literally never turns well always ruinous right majority. work interventional radiology, would impossible COVID test false Aladeen first-time tests 10% positive retests 10% daily new tests, cutting going huge impact test backlogs. know what? I'm somewhat glad country ugly light shining upon it.

Oh yeah. fucked either way. think sooner acknowledge fucked completely beyond repair better. don‚Äôt really know practical solutions could actually happen level government response now. yes, fucked. right. mean &amp; stop it. mailing people's homes letting self administer? Change delivery mechanism avoid crowds panic lines?  32 boat. convinced anyone age 55 want inconvenienced first time. Ya generally people pulling guns fight stupid things. piece shit. stupid taken long

Why though? job protect publics health. fucked private corporations ones taking measures local governments. Frump woman? seeing local target give wiping self checkouts, wearing masks even attempting enforce mask wearing (california) really doubt anyone going try make sure people wear keep get inside. hope though late good decision giant game ""chicken"" them. None major retailers wanted first implement this, soon feared customers would go elsewhere.

But soon first one flinched, wow, look that, they're requiring masks now!

This nothing game profits losses them. Please shower praise upon holier thou asses something rightfully done months ago. state room 1 more?  governor late stay-at-home orders party, finally claiming found asymptomatic people spread virus. I'll bet he'll issue mandatory mask order claiming found masks help prevent spread covid-19. guess one never will. Hobby Lobby. opposite likely happen... Yes.

Btw, Nice argument comparing unrelated subjects make sense together. even get from? army? Corona's spreading services like wildfire. can't put social contact genie way bottle, impossible. Yep. went Japan February told wear masks back then. March mask shortages happening. plenty knowledge back masks true naive poor. people dependent good leaders right? certain president certain governor certain hospital admins pushing wisdom top, poor mentioning would covered various infection points adapt leadership‚Äôs direction.

The horrible infection rates absolutely leadership failure. leaders almost universally richest among us. heard get reference. think look folks eye... Due loose skin post weight loss surgery, doctor told stuck overweight BMI category without skin removal surgery. Lost 156 pounds. Currently 14 pounds normal BMI really losing anymore BMI 54 27. worry say overweight high risk Covid19 obesity. doctor thrilled current improvement health frustrating able achieve normal especially people act like overweight bad obese countries level freedom press Sweden would able find equally much bad happening pandemic.

I heard swedes known arrogant condescending believe recently.    
And comment one confirmation Swedes view themselves.     
Just things right (education, ecology, healthcare - privatized) mean rest world bad. kid Arizona still hosting tournaments kids across country fly play front college scouts. month ago shit went crazy played big tournament surprise. conflicted going one hand really safety hazard, potential college prospects line well. going anymore things gotten bad definitely still held. Fake news = Truth You‚Äôre even discussing good faith anymore. good one. gotta love making pandemic political.  May souls rest peace.

The least do, Americans honour family members, fellow Americans lost loved one wearing damn mask. agree. people drool watching educational videos though. need utilize ""Sex sells"". Trump filled white house basement millions pills Kushner scalp hospitals, maybe evangelical TV too. rules. people could stay home, essential workers would like work still pass go collect $2,000 dollars addition regular pay. Doesn‚Äôt sound fair you? see trend among governors like ahole, DeSaveUs, etc. want let people die pursuit cool liked. fruitless. failing. People dying. constituents finally seeing real.

Do. Your. Damn. Jobs Honestly wouldn‚Äôt anything, want us die it‚Äôs less people pay think üôÉ  Turns Fallout right whole time. Dang. Cool.

Sooo stays home 6 year old? 

Somebody quit full-time job. pay bills now? Maybe need move.

But maybe group parents, need somebody watch bunch kids somebody's house pay them. Anyone experienced already high demand. exactly kids 8 hours day, short notice? good choice?

What going single parent?

""Keep home"" sounds great four months CA. situation worse. long kids going kept school? Years? Wtf wrong entitled idiots ""Do harm... members' insurance billings."" Maybe it‚Äôs coronavirus taken brain... truly hope catch rona! I'd really love eventually one higher ups snapped called everyone stupidity, arrogance, willful ignorance. 

I know get us anywhere better, possibly would serve make things worse. would sooooo cathartic. they're not. They're running next draft. War coming. probably permanent hospital bills that‚Äôll remind regret every time looks every month. 2025 Maybe give police job actually matters. absolutely persecuted. kinda disagree, guys iradicating covid, need shut states surge, like florida burn people lose chance I've seen WAAAAAY many Texas, Florida, Arizona plates near house effective state-by-state. people care stay shut in, people don't... nowhere go anyways. confused upvoted. missing? must never forgive fox news republican party brainwashing family members literally sentencing death believe it. say lot bad things state absolute best accent indignation.

ABSO-DAMN-LUTELY!!!!! vote (OR governor), rage indescribable. said, may old, still brain cells. research candidates, couldn't, good conscience, vote either them. think said conservatively-leaning Independent, identify neither party. guy might dumber evil Trump.

Its unbelievable he's this. bit time waste.

Go Google Maps, type Armand-Frappier Boulevard. look names companies popping street. Alot big players pharma industry, others, dunno we're grouped like eh. literally sign corner street saying (Cit√© de la Biotechnologie) translate ""Biotech City"". Extremely misleading post. Seems like 2/3rds folks replying fooled it. Curious florida parks mist sprayers keep cool? fact. words: Curve flattened, pandemic more, go back work plebs... Yes April 3-11C Practically beach weather Scandinavians. peaked turn season... 

Exactly I'm pointing out. likewise big practical health challenges face-to-face classes right now. US could handled like Europe, maybe. crabs-in-a-bucket individualism prevented it.

Children carriers. die themselves. infect families. infect teachers. 

Most us believe life sacred. 

Most us believe sacrifice teachers children grandparents upon Altar Mammon. Yeah, weird reading sorts articles, since I've come take granted people here, NYC, almost always wear masks stores indoor areas...and months. weird think places see almost 100% people indoors wearing masks.

A national mandate would definitely work, since mask enforcement worked cities states applied. Thank you. I‚Äôm saving name phone that‚Äôs really good know. keep telling kids journal people going interested experience whole lives. like interviewed Grandparents WWII great depression. parents came age cold war paranoia duck cover. kids interview 9/11 aftermath like. many friends joining military pay school, getting thrown brand new war.
This bigger faced parents. definitely affecting kids previous generational struggle, they're taking brunt it. interest group doctors, best interests members find new ways keep drumming business? COVID-19 patient billable insurance for, anyway? Hmm.... condom hole ""works"" standards. Dude u adopted can‚Äôt help wonder blocking Atlanta mask order new level racist fuckery. hope Georgia turns back blue. mean, parents defense, definition ""fairly"" successful? someones options say, go school pick career path needed potential make 60-80k annually, MUCH higher success rate becoming famous streamer (especially days streaming bloated people trying it). could spend years trying become streamer end fans youre still working shitty radio shack day job 6 years. completely get parents coming from. Congrats baby! welcome join us r/loseitbaby 

There lots November December 2019 bumpers :) Thank you. beginning lose hope. mean... 4 months late say best time start saving today... better late never... reason believe another wave Sweden?

A sufficient amount population infected recovered virus, combined pre-existing T-cell immunity means total community resistance virus high enough stop second wave.

That's reason.

With cases low enough testing high enough, Sweden move test-trace-isolate, would give exact chance avoiding second wave everyone else.

That's another reason. whoops 100% deaths? Sure. Enjoy freedom order shit online, champ.

Edit - Confused sentence. Apologies snarky hostility. makes much difference situation...

But right go steroid treat covid IV dexamethasone. It‚Äôs even stronger prednisone!

I‚Äôm sorry go back. sure find N95s haven‚Äôt already.

Be safe ‚ù§Ô∏è is, care Thats huge spike.... think keep Fauci ditch orange idiot &amp; horrible children. recommendations COVID contradictory, thats mostly due Trump constantly contradicting subject matter experts. He's far worst president I've seen lifetime. slightly click baity headline. understand anger responsible youth feel like they're lumped irresponsible ones. Hopefully see Dr. Fauci old grouch looking blame youth everything. 

Also help Fauci says this. boss exactly opposite trying push reopening schools without proper measures place, especially cases surging. rumours news buddy. Buy rumor, sell news. used think things heard rumors, turns time gets me... News. come numbers? everyone serious see change couple weeks. nice, wants people meet Jesus /s Theres punk song sentence. I've minimal contract everyone since March 17th. Left house month groceries. week work light paperwork 3 hours. Collecting UI it. Saving every penny UI runs end month. could waited tried hold two weeks bonus 600 want play cards like that.

So starting Monday two (hopefully) jobs make ends meet. One working 15 hours small store minimal traffic undetermined amount time. (if comes through) cleaning painting vacant apartments. seem relatively safe time tell. idea amount per hour cleaning job anything 11 would nice. Used make $20... make 11 + job work theory I'm willing stop eating healthy take chances covid19 obesity. 

Had everyone done many us could going back previous jobs. could low digit numbers almost normal like countries. unemployed, still form UBI helping people Add rehab. nearly 3 months, she'd atrophied she'd need assistance stand up. fucking travesty. People dying jacksss power trip. Walmart requires walk mask. that, half store maskless weren‚Äôt notifying state many negative. Also personally know couple signed testing site left tested received positive results even though never tested. I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre cooking books definitely lot mistakes made Florida coronavirus testing  order cities private corporations. Come everyone! banner year /r/leopardsatemyface! implication consumer grade mask would protect wearer questionable. Certainly inhibits wearer infecting others.  

If incorrect would appreciate links science.  still grappling issue. 

BTW wear mask whenever go public indoor space.  one thing help. Heyoh! accurate descriptive statistic would Sweden US among 200+ countries least top 10 worst cases. think accurately visualizing shit load political responsibility 140000 deaths. Sweden smaller NYC terms population. demagogues comparing pretending epidemiologists? Mfw upvoted comment complains voted :-o husband working home since second week March. stay in, hang kid, cook, keep busy. try big outside activity like hiking week.

Wait...so...no brunch? Oh, god...maybe bad here. üòÇ Glass half full? fine reading last paragraph. That‚Äôs rough. think Simon started requiring month ago? Change ugly FUCKED.   Meanwhile Georgia's governor Brian Kemp busy banning cities mandating masks Months.

ü•∫ get un tagged good news. Nothing changed data still HHS first  would like Thank Walmart first announce mandatory masks.

It looks like major retailers waiting someone go first Walmart rest followed. guy basic definition authoritarian leader. Really hope someone gives deserves day. Starts G, ends Uillotine Things like important young children.

I kid Watergate. remember scared adult would tell going on. got old enough seek answers, surprised angry gone bed scared adults want take couple minutes explain like I'm five (which was).

Obviously coloring book Watergate would inappropriate, whenever topic dominating evening news, kids hear it. see way adults react make fearful. may hide it, know something right imaginations come kinds things. 

Even young children taught dumbed-down version what's going on. ""There's bad sickness there, ways stay safe. order mask?

The cost dealing fallout bad Coronavirus situation hell lot cost paying benefits elderly.

The Office Budget Responsibility thinks UK spending around ¬£300 billion schemes furlough scheme (paying people can't go work) loans/grants companies can't operate shutdown.

That's direct cost Exchequer, including long term harm comes people losing jobs earning less throughout lives business going recovering.

The pension pay 45,000 60,000 people who've died make dent that. Speaking someone related people vehemently ubi, social programs, welfare. always get argument start giving people handouts, lazy people stop working use stimulus money drugs. concept apparently WORST possible outcome, leads decline society ultimately collapse civilization means parents can't trust kids something simple social distancing order protect themselves. kids cannot trusted that, taking care oneself hours way much expect them. know cousin pregnant luckily lives good distance away.

This pretty irrelevant since school age children live said, still higher mortality numbers peers staying home locking still safest option all.

There complete lack nuance school opening debate. tough question sure closing schools HUGE societal effects. Sweden [up 10% kids exposed violence someone removing school makes impossible teachers alert social services ongoing abuse. safest option them. [In US school closures lead growing racial class disparities educational policy measures weight side effects actions benefit. ample international research shows for, whatever reason, kids risk spread COVID like adults do. positive effects schools closing spread virus well established obvious negative effects are. Sat reading tears eyes flick see county county exponential growth. stopped Florida, 12 worst affected counties still accelerating rapidly signs they're levelling off.

I'm running words describe bad things are; energy many leaders treating threat sort giant public health game chicken, arranging populations road like skittles traffic speeds towards them, horns blaring. 77k Covid deaths yesterday testing ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù? US. Shameful. Meanwhile, local playgrounds reopening Friday, suffered strict soul economy crushing lockdown, mandated masks public spaces non-compliance fines, infections minimal manageable.

Best wishes speedy recovery. Lol, reversed course. They've testing isolating people large companies allowed work home.

People told work home since March Sweden. Yes, they've increased testing, nothing changing course. They've remarkably steady recommendations.

If anything, wish they'd change stubbornness recommending notable story Sweden initial aim herd immunity, failed occur, got lots people killed would otherwise.

God, many times need say herd immunity ""strategy""? said inevitable end state pandemic, everyone keeps saying getting quickly possible ""the plan"".

Sweden's plan flatten curve hospitals get overwhelmed, set recommendations constitutional could maintained 18+ months necessary.

That's it. save economy, get herd immunity quickly possible.

They utterly failed keeping residence homes old people. I'll fault that. Fool! fraudulently claimed $9 million gambled stock market like fraudsters. feel lot people general wanting non-capitalist system moment Imagine, corporations better standards governments... already barely test is, people getting results days, want reduce too. replies like can't take sub seriously.

Literal shitloads people pushing narrative described - certainly part hospitals collapsing weight infected patients. appear happening, least foregone conclusion avoiding lockdowns indeed unequivocally good news. 

But apparently, caught narrative acknowledge that. Nah, let's draw oversimplified, Manichean dichotomies ""functioning humanity"" (everyone agrees you) ""non-functioning humanity"" (everyone disagrees you). Surely that's intelligent, rational way us navigate crisis.  Formula 1 it. strict mask separation rules, even divide team multiple 'bubbles' isolate group one tests positive, without stopping entire team. checked least twice week; think go 5000 tests per week. Bulk testing extremely efficient results come negative, run many tests single batch thus actually consume much testing resources. entire F1 organization running separate world, practically physical contact anyone outside F1. races Austria, chartered jets buses, landed military airport near track ensure contact non-F1 public. they're Europe.

And they're holding races fans. winners receive trophies remote-controlled robot. They're 3rd week racing, AFAIK 0 tests come positive. 

THAT run sport pandemic. hate smug is. assume everyone wearing mask COVID? don‚Äôt think CDC reporting new numbers though, though July 15. So, data still shifting, know transparent data be.

Also registered Independent voter, might well change Democrat now. NEVER vote Republican (unless it‚Äôs Larry Hogan). Republicans allowing ridiculousness occur, never forget it. enabled continue enable Trump. Disgusting sad. Science real. 

This NPR: ‚ÄúIt surprising ‚Äî shocking even, would say ‚Äî many us realize yesterday would required report HHS [this new] platform,"" says Cassandra Pierre, acting hospital epidemiologist Boston Medical Center.

On Monday, email flagged ""Special Bulletin"" American Hospital Association obtained NPR, informed hospitals data reporting change, indicated distribution remdesivir, drug that's used treat hospitalized COVID patients, would tied daily data reported TeleTracking portal. ""The daily reporting mechanism used [remdesivir] calculations,"" email AHA reads.

HHS could immediately confirm failure switch new HHS system means hospital longer get key drug therapy federal government.‚Äù China ""science based policy"" folk selling weird animal parts half year ago maybe boat. 

Sure might eventually responded well initial lack response (I'm talking years) let happen first place. deserve praise. like MMR, diptheria, HPV, meningitis, etc probably scrape profit enough people get given talking big bucks here

FFS. effing money. Selfish greedy b@$t@rd$. America comes vaccine, one trusts released. Still easily better Trump. sucks right. Here's example French paper Science found 2.9% overall hospitalization rate 0.5% IFR. heavily dependent age (Fig 2 Table Assuming working since beginning pandemic, mask protected months inserted ventilators sickest sickest Coronavirus patients. 

From I‚Äôve heard masks aren‚Äôt 100%. Thy SIGNIFICANTLY reduce chances catching it. unfortunately lots health care workers died. 

I‚Äôve never worked hospital speculation‚Äî she‚Äôs inserting ventilators, must seconds taking mask patients inserting ventilator. 

We also don‚Äôt know supplied good mask, hospital resorting making staff reuse masks. people dying. yeah tell üôÑ Sorry, lost haha subject. hiking trail (that really narrow, definitely getting closer 6ft someone coming way) didn‚Äôt think grab mask. Whenever would approach someone coming opposite direction would hold breath turn head away everyone walk edge path, getting hit lots tree branches. nice hike, would‚Äôve better didn‚Äôt scratches tree sap arm. irony meter ... need insult children like that, kids generally smartest folks households... Nobody invest software. government required law provide Free Appropriate Public Education. pandemic, appropriate means remotely/online! need demand state federal government fund public. 100 less worry ‚ÄúA mask must worn gaps greater 1 mm design‚Äù

But dumbasses think they‚Äôre clever even smaller perforations. kind wording may help. said people symptoms wear masks, people sick help need reserve masks need them

You agreeing told people wear masks. pretty weak excuse IMO. People always hated facemasks seen sign oppression. brand stupidity isn‚Äôt new. wouldn‚Äôt incited hoax business, wouldn‚Äôt half country acting extremely morons. would huge plus sure exist around here. lazy work around trees Record number fake test results first Long lasting? impossible know whats long lasting wide spread started March. July. point examine 50 percent patients see contracted considered covid free determine long lasting symptoms. many underlying conditions like diabetes asthma? 

I've colds coughs lingered two months subsided.

Reddit sort zero logic rule. 50 percent! know nothing else people 50 percent! guys really love complain Spanish Flu lasted 4 years total seven eight month it. second wave already expected happen start purpose keeping first wave control prevent healthcare system dealing two wave time. reason coverage bad idiots keep thinking Sweden great model follow done everywhere. Sweden‚Äôs method would absolutely work lot places could argued didn‚Äôt even work them, even top scientists said didn‚Äôt go way expected. 

People also want black white ‚Äúthey won‚Äù ‚Äúit horrendous‚Äù rather acknowledging actually went pretty badly, even didn‚Äôt get bad feared. Seriously people camping, swimming lake, getting haircut, etc spreading large numbers, people congregating large indoor spaces, bars, etc. sick Covid police make think stay holed forever. biggest states deaccelerating growth meh confirmed cases states like LA SC MS GA.

 I‚Äôm *certain* right. people confident predict future think confidence unfounded. Reality isn‚Äôt predictable imagine Nah it'd fine. Cops wear masks here. Haha, oh dear Borris. end November, begins November. fire rises. following reddit groupthink, therefore, must downvoted.

At worse, New York 10k infections/1k deaths per day Florida bad death wise yet.

Florida's better ratio blamed greater testing experience.

The simple fact is, Florida reduce infections health system becomes overloaded mortality rates increase New York levels. think they're anywhere near peak yet. things like working home improved hygiene public places permanent.

Especially working home thing - many businesses already calculating much money save getting rid office space. (Going forward need meeting rooms).

So lot changes permanent. time shops pubs re-opened, they're taking trouble hygiene. hygiene improvements also permanent.

Here‚Äôs humbling fact scared folks . get virus , everyone . new flu ....ask wanna live wasteland bullshit get back normal life. vaccine way stop friends called USA ""Brazil north"" Brazil ""USA Latino""

Of course, covid.... knew prescient were.... B-b-b-b-Baby, ain‚Äôt seen nothin‚Äô yet! wake 250.000 Lmao love ‚Äúit‚Äôs Fauci‚Äôs fault‚Äù angle because. 

Trump may ambivalent masks, that‚Äôs meaningless context. severely downplayed virus kept, face absolutely supporting data, suggesting ‚Äúhoax‚Äù virus going evaporate despite wide-ranging actions taken. 

In word Fauci holding administration back. That‚Äôs laughable ends spectrum terms hot takes. take pandemic seriously, gonna take seriously?

Don't dare say war. war virus. Marginal herd immunity restrictions longer herd immunity restrictions relaxed, R jump back unrestricted value. already overrun many areas, head r/coronavirusaz direct evidence.

I‚Äôm betting it‚Äôs matter time bodies start stored ice skating rinks. american tumors didnt decide turn one guy rockstar even he's great. good way go Governor suing mayor?

Costco top shit covid. 

Also, hotdogs bomb still $1.50 drink. 

I‚Äôd elect Costco president could. crazy Karen's gonna go?

Without $600 get $89 week live on. industry completely decimated high risk, can‚Äôt exactly get job exposed people day. think removing unemployment going benefit many seats election fall? record unemployment, rising COVID cases, eviction moratoriums ending, top bunch sick kids schools open.

I think current plan keep enhanced benefits, cap made before. - too! Saying ""defund police"" ""abolish police"" pro 2a anything NRA could ever do. police, everyone Billy kid pistol hip. foreign country event went bar... thing going mind we‚Äôd dead fire broke out. Tiny stair basement whole place jammed packed. feel spikes gun sales past decade people already guns buying more. Back China   Yeah like someone gets elected second term. shudder think would happen person get reelected. They're people states taking virus seriously. state hit super hard, we're pretty well. want army walking chemical weapons taking resources hospitals near me. Ok point? That‚Äôs still lot positive tests.

Or matter? Probably mostly old going die soon anyway? You, like low IQ right-wing Americans, idea word 'communism' means.

I hope kept receipt shitty education, need get refund. Oh no. mean literally. aren‚Äôt available... y‚Äôall. Lol üòÜ happens country invaded troops. silly, assuage fear angry black people, shoot course Yeesh. 

New record. Wonder % positive is. We've hovering around 9% while.   True story. get downvotes. Hmmm pretty hard argue ""Everything factor"" also adds absolutely nothing discussion. :) yeah everything factor :)

I think favorable weather beneficial reducing spread influensa several decieses. would however argue rate transmission novel virus would completely drown effect (which arguably seeing instance Brazil now)

That leaves us either people abiding recommendations work and/or population building immunity.  43,351,945-39,802,297= 3,549,648

Which amount cases US. 

So I'm sure question there. Yeah, don‚Äôt know anything working there, can‚Äôt imagine retail chain size would treat employees well. Except China, France, Italy, New York, West Coast. never seen anything like this, weren‚Äôt paying attention. Glad governors Northeast sacks shit like Kemp. Masks mandatory across region we're hitting beaches, dining etc. keeping spread control. southerners need get shit together, especially unhealthy population is. 

Just wear fucking mask stop crying, weirdos. didn‚Äôt know ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt get them‚Äù meant someone else. maybe said ya‚Äôll something Really? global pandemic bad?

It‚Äôs always bad. Comparing government running business moronic  time thing done Courts Election come gone. Vote like life depends really does. Honestly though, *doesn't* spark increase gun sales? almost like NRA exists increase gun sales amongst scared white membership

/s obviously people stop able afford rent food, BLM protests gonna look like picnic.

I think lot rage protests directly related COVID. issue worth protesting, lot people came blow steam.

At least state, protests turned white anarchist property destruction pretty quickly. Black people would speak co-opting movement, asking stop destroying would get booed. Sweden exceptionalism failed Swedes, American exceptionalism failing Americans.

But Swedish policies applied US destined produce much worse outcome. obesity, overcrowded housing, inclination among public defy guidance, less access healthcare. assume everything 20 people hospitalised? also think numbers knew many people asymptomatic tested? yes still bad 1/5 people ill long term issues, would lot noise.

Also Sky news sucks ass ‚Äúrunning things‚Äù Protesting constitutional right. Getting shitfaced bar not. Now? Gowns, mask, face shield gloves required enter patients room. There's trasportation process get into. known covid+ people

The first month+ ppe little would hoarded employees.

Espero que tu presidente piense un poco en su gente vaya cuarentena la verdad, es muy importante aparte que realmente funciona dont take cheating voter suppression account. plan make November 4th, think actual plan needs Olympic keep winning like this? Totally disagree! states close down, think residents states likely go? That's right, states closed down, especially live near border open states relatives second house ielsewhere till opened. oh citizens family members die driving 800 miles hospital, go press. truth hidden. workers need speak out. important info missing piece: de-activating material? silver? nickel? safe breathing in? Yes, laws protect dumb too. However, wearing seatbelt doesn‚Äôt prevent entry establishments. It‚Äôs also provable fact save lives accidents. Masks, much. Getting false positive pcr test would like accidentally building airplane could fly. It‚Äôs extremely unlikely. Getting false negative pcr test, closer 20% chance.

PCR tests use diagnosis. case white house didnt want cdc whole numbers (this include deaths hospitalizations, etc). However decision cancelled, states continue report numbers (website) also cdc before. usually due another ailment occurs result dementia. best friend's mom eat end. like baby. frail weak. 

I never asked specifics, probably died due infection ravaged immune system since get enough nutrients feeding tube. 

It's extremely sad process witness. Y‚Äôall gotta pay shit?! void minecraft better leadership refurbished pieces twine. already round this, least live. mid-March shelter-in-place order went effect, people panic buying gun shops. I'm really looking forward waves proliferation lethal weapons flooding neighborhoods. everyone uses kind face cover virus load way low air. problem people really difficult time understanding this. Even worse, leaders political issue topic. But...... local control?... Honestly true tho. Seeing craziness makes cherish college college experience more.
Some elements college experience (possibly best ones) don‚Äôt translate well age. take online college classes 30 they‚Äôll call ‚Äúa future entrepreneur.‚Äù hook freshmen 30 you‚Äôre creep. I‚Äôll never 20 I‚Äôll never rising junior college again. Fuck grade want experiences. Tbh. read first comment. First thing said... buy liquor pretty much gas station. *Laughs Nebraskan*  live US I've started double masking- KN95 bottom surgical mask help hold snug face provide additional layer.

 shit scary. Looking data page, really tells need know what's going United States. stark contrast current situation states really something behold. I'm sure much evidence need comes figuring works fighting virus, absolutely doesn't....

 Manhattan McDonald‚Äôs today.. Manager tells woman kid indoor sitting allow.. goes crazy shouting scream mask don‚Äôt work gonna die. burst laughing humans important mink? Compared Orange cunt? 

Obvs barely shut long enough barely build ppe supplies running low. Testing never real priority. Well works bank age 25 parents health insurance health insurance, probably ok sucks think much hospital stay costs. tried flex seal? True, even so, still running things January. Okay, I'll read rest paragraph, said one pride culture rooted bigotry. pride that. Despite may believe, southerners pride many black people ancestors lynched. second half paragraph still implies there's nothing proud of.

Are problematic aspects southern culture? Yes, celebrate parts. actively work speak aspects southern culture celebrating appreciating good parts it. inViSiBlE hAnD MarKeT moment can't send someone else deal 8 hours per day, society breaks know it.

See, problem assuming people actual choice matter. happens let corporations stack deck workers get away paying shit wages work done. Previously businesses would pay enough single income could support family. jobs still exist they're orders magnitude rare used be. areas US, people need 2 incomes want able raise children, unfortunately means end needing childcare. 

It's unsustainable system couple decades now, actually anything stress badly. nearly came crashing 2008, somehow didn't. longer term stress it, directly hitting impacting peoples' ability work, whole house cards coming tumbling down. Fun fact, 0.35% USA million people. That's almost many deaths soldiers died American wars since revolutionary war. also higher percent casualty rate per population either world war.

People grossly underestimate devastating small percent deaths be. Yeah I'm strategy seems be, defund realize funded them. frustrating. Oh. I've saying since almost beginning. Surviving may leave wishing dead see bills. They‚Äôre out. REALLY get one? absolute villain. Wearing mask best way get economy back track.  lot people border states get expensive meds like Insulin Canada. wonder faring. US everything hide pandemic. 99% Politicians greedy devils seem want us dead even money know already. still part base. gotta lonely right now. mean know scream echo chambers, thats within circles. Whenever voice opinion elsewhere, ridiculed be. 

Facebook Twitter another cancer feeds base. firmly ‚Äúcorrelation causation‚Äù bucket proven otherwise. 

There lots reasons new account openings, massively devalued market set opportunities new investment. work ccp getting friend killed I‚Äôll upset, first week March. already locked month+ point. say see lot Florida plates too, due old job know many people snowbird thing register cars FL think it‚Äôs cheaper something, see long they‚Äôre wearing mask try extend grace live too.
But maybe I‚Äôm base side eyeing them. since mentioned Japanese news, kind hint I'm Japan.


Everyone wearing masks. usually winter due influenza/hay fever season anyways 'normal times'.

Japan bit rise cases, since pandemic started, still 30k confirmed cases less 1100 deaths.


Science shown over, over, many countries examples, masks help.

People like Japanese, countries, laughing us. people like we're faring better.


Oh fun fact, large cluster Japan currently? American military mishap judgment. Hmm. bad. majority. It‚Äôs become part fucked platform. true passed law withdraw pension funds also ? country political shit show around [Only 40% Oakland's 15% black know. could never get algebra homework time school... phase II results get published? already know disease spread much countries use masks.

BTW sure absolutely clue countries use masks don't, epidemic working countries.

And really amazing 6 months corona, many people still ignorant basic information. Unemployed get $600/week, plus regular unemployment payments. people, somewhere around $4,000/ month. notion US Government done anything regular people flat false. Now, could done more? Hell yes. they're going $600 payments end month. country back normal? portions still lock down? Spoiler: give better read continued pop denier bullshit. Yeah woman must raped stupidity selfishness infuriating. shit happening *in Georgia* initial first wave.

Source: live include headaches dizziness percentage, looked patients hospitalized. Yea anything requires sacrifice commitment large group count America out. Land me, me, me...while touting past sacrifices citizens war veterans like something it‚Äôs good enough never change adapt. 

Keep lying want, America anything great. Can‚Äôt even come together achieve common goal. crisis threatens health wellbeing everyone sizable chunk can‚Äôt bothered minor sacrifices. everyone pitched gave nights put discomfort mask, would add making huge impact. Sadly, isn‚Äôt case. Science public health voting issue, add another item list things nobody agree on. wedge certainly aided bad faith actors extreme polarization media, say that‚Äôs reason would dishonest. Big restaurants malls reopening nobody wearing masks. could literally throw party crowded area masks nothing would happen ridiculous. Geen goed. Immunity binary concept. Even among individuals. people higher levels immunity, immunity ‚Äúherd‚Äù has. 14 days three options (impeachment, 25th amendment election) first two failed republican party death cult wants us die agony. interesting argument Time let Covid clean gene pool. Trump visited violated city/ county mask law FL, know DeSantis would thing bend backwards cover Trump. 

I'm convinced Trump violating Atlanta mask law main reason Kemp it. Well that's depressing. exactly racist? Americans üòÇ terms unreasonable then. Every kid know struggling classwork pandemic. state shouldn‚Äôt allowed set arbitrary restrictions like this. violated probation didn‚Äôt hop one foot full hour one day, would still think reasonable? tremendous beans. Nobody ever seen beans like these. Obama wasn‚Äôt able bring beans country first president it. remarkable way. lot people talking great job was. democrats fought hard prevent beans coming country able get here. best beans ever saw it‚Äôs remarkable thing really look able do. People still looking say it‚Äôs amazing thing beans. Well, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau financial-related regulatory sense, intentionally *strangled bathtub* Mick Mulvaney. every regulatory non-wall/defense agency diminished eliminated GOP admin power. everyone wearing mask Republicans? think people photograph Republicans? criticism events spreading covid? Get politics science. Anything spreads covid criticized condemned **equally**.  expert biased lacks credibility. Especially way parts Georgia hit first wave. You‚Äôre right, things earlier even minimal. seems disappeared entirely. acted like NY NJ started improve, problem over. seems lot idiot states thought well. 

There isn‚Äôt much since states responses, way government works, imo get back TV tell people serious is, advise everyone wear masks indoors, keep socially distancing careful, advise governors implement closures methods limit spread, mask mandates. done March, encouraged states NY area cohesive response. said we‚Äôre together, states NY NJ CT length time, measures, actually slow nationwide, would even got bad it‚Äôs getting bad now. truly think could nipped bid states seeing crazy rises now.

But didn‚Äôt that. won‚Äôt. He‚Äôs divisive acting like it‚Äôs huge deal therefore R governors listening following lead like pathetic little puppies. encouraging ‚Äúmuh freedom, muh constitutional rights‚Äù morons words actions (or lack thereof). me. I‚Äôm NY *most* younger crowd good. There‚Äôs song stupid stuff people know age range home masked. riskiest seem 18-22 zone.. college kids. Why, it‚Äôs like mask would prevented illness. Hispanic probably played bigger role. regret that? really worried burden going put healthcare welfare system US. Yes. understand article says, I'm telling American justice system functions. go jail violating probation parole...its original crime. would take 10 seconds Google verify saying. 

But, no. I'm sure Brit better insight justice system works, especially since whining specific fuckup. even hear yourself? Lol

""This person wasnt charged domestic violence proves probation violations nothing initial crime.""

What? Lol must lied loan applications well order ‚Äúqualify‚Äù much money.  work buddy suggested idea, students stay 1 room teachers move classroom classroom. Worst thing Bolsonaro got virus still taking seriously. Boris took seriously Bolsonaro even (Boris) got virus (he imposed national lockdown testing positive). need start passing laws idiots get arrested spend serious time jail hefty fines.  Canada managed schooling home March end year. managed best could tried keep mind we're unprecedented situation, everyone lot stress, sometimes school top priority. one's falling behind, every student country boat. 

I think found work day really changed too. home, kids. still worked, people lot flexible when/how worked. 

We got it. got easier time. positive love . fucked America's leading expert: ""I'm effective"".  Oops. bit finger mum.

Meanwhile, Johnny Depp sue crazy ex London court cutting finger broken finger. black people vulnerable virus. state lot black people. racist. simple. Yeah, mom tested positive 53 days, negative total 74 Winter coming school start back up, restrictions planned seem inhumane kids. district considering day kids never leave desks except monitored bathroom breaks recess stay masked except eating lunch desks. awful think little kids. went tried setting desks appropriate distancing. room left teacher even kids, plan going forward relies large percentage families commit distance learning least first half school year. Teachers kids forced back space remain. 

What avoidable tragedy is, awful mess around. I‚Äôm hyperbolic. want skip mask outside, need stay 6 feet away everyone. So, pick quiet place quiet time, legally skip mask outside. Even walking around, people keep case pass another group meet people. Wise move. many different flu variations ‚Äúseasonal flu vaccine‚Äù protects common year. Unfortunately still get infected flu virus flu vaccine designed protect per CDC. sure it‚Äôs vaccine antibody preparation. Kemp: ""nah let people voted die."" Lmao that‚Äôs rhyme. It‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúdog‚Äù ‚Äúpig‚Äù rhyme end sound. wear damn mask. isn‚Äôt complicated. someone reported OSHA, care all. There's profit COVID, there's profit suing employers. come workplace whistleblew even though could've major story. even followed up. friends reported similar situations even get email call back. agency 100% abandoned entire reason existing. since virus Democrat hoax, give ventilators virus real US? But, rent-a-cops typically pay even like it. instance, might say ""sir know b******* store requires wear mask wear one I'll escort out."" I‚Äôm hyperbolic. want skip mask outside, need stay 6 feet away everyone. So, pick quiet place quiet time, legally skip mask outside. Even walking around, people keep case pass another group meet people. California northeast? Also, remember treating patients tent hospitals New York? wait couple weeks, brother. I‚Äôm sure numbers now, days ago, 50 hospitals Florida alone free ICU beds. locking 100% time avoiding contact altogether? 

Because not, odds getting infected lower odds infected dozen strangers interact daily.

No one wants say loud that's reality COVID: people 100% get step houses. parent 100% isolating visiting harmless. 
8000. Several US states daily cases, realizing depressing, ugh give *our* tax dollars back *us,* hell going steal tax dollars stack offshore accounts? Schroedinger's Tax Dollars, know! human. behavior model political party ideology.. 77000 new cases/day. great, terrible. Yeah... know definitely stupid young people stupid shit life (I‚Äôm 25), it‚Äôs mostly older crowd stupid shit. friends. American agree you,  Land free Home COVID-19 cases . God help us . lot countries copied even improved 

Agreed. name least dozen countries top head I'd rather citizen America.

America failed state reverting back developing nation status. total shit hole now. Larry Summers involved Clinton presidency. good years Americans. People also obsessed using specific cases read perpetuating fear.

Every person personally know got covid really bad flu week went back normal lingering symptoms.

I'm saying want get it, all. stop equating getting sick extremes that's completely false healthy people. Omg maybe cousin! I‚Äôm fortunate live RI, feel like leaders represented us others‚Äô interests. 

However, don‚Äôt think people Florida Georgia say same. patients lupus would would benefit cost distribution. Malaria still endemic much world. Probably Florida coming decades, though medication expires. next president donate HCQ WHO, MSF, and/or Gates Foundation. ""dude, group project, need hack us, ask join"" end -y.... I‚Äôm seeing legitimate rhyme? like 780. Yeah it‚Äôs surprising cuz surgical masks pretty non intrusive. N95 find try wear I‚Äôll end buying another mask store cuz pretty unbearable wear long time. ADHD. 

As someone years teaching experience, try remote teaching child learning difficulties.

Please children. even gunna waste time dumbass officially ""let eat cake"" moment. actually serious? think herd immunity 20% testing positive antibodies?  Alright sorry won‚Äôt encourage anti-vaxxers anymore. yes still aiming safety effectiveness, process still rushed long-term effects could still missed. mean guess time healthcare essential workers get let‚Äôs face important really getting there, even though might get vaccine four times faster current mumps record, good enough don‚Äôt antibodies it‚Äôs really going protect others. prickly heat rash, pink eye, sore throat April. Got tested 3 times, negative. Antibody test June negative. 

It likely seasonal allergy Money reason, think know now. special crowd, cuz freedom ofc...gotta freedoms. people‚Äôs lives never mattered conservatives. care individual wealth power. Hi. this? Kindly please advise. Thanks advance. safe. Stupid bullshit. even read moronic drivel? ""The primadonna Trump-hating reporter, long ago violated one cardinal sins journalism, making part story, cherry-picked comment White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany Thursday, presenting quote entirely context."" 

Really? see context watching unedited clip. exactly context.

Better yet, idiotic defense: ""The great irony comes cabal ignores science altogether insist man fancies woman indeed woman""

Are REALLY telling real news article? fake bullshit. Go back home ground troll, troll, go back anti science, completely random transphobic bullshit article stop trying pretend Trump blame press secretary lie, misstate facts, misrepresent data tragedy nonstop. 

If even BEGIN reading obvious propaganda bullshit immediately clear damaging dishonest crap they've spouting months. 
Go back theDonald... oh wait, got banned hateful, inaccurate, FAKE crap exactly like One important thing realize hurts make monthly trips border fill insulin meds due high costs insurance US. Whatever takes, guess. almost feel like standing outside store nicely offering people mask. berate like morons are, they're likely pull gun shit. hate I‚Äôve become hope assholes get very, sick. source already posted different comments though cause different, *same* health condition. fact previous coronavirus named condition way around incredibly prominent (sars stands - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). relevant right look icu admission suffering snake bite. figures scientific community want know discrepancy reports physician journalists treatment protocol (which globally requires least oxygen therapy, least simple oxygen mask) official strategy *any* study existing proving there's merit use least form oxygen therapy. scientific study claiming would like see it. said best case scenario elderly receive hospital care (which course includes extremely cheap extremely effective treatments oxygen therapy, antibiotics secondary infection, fluids, antiinflammatory sometimes anticoagulants). mortality hospitalisation rate, combined journalist sources claiming respirator use used elderly disconcerting best, medically ethically. seems three things really helped Japan keep cases low contained.

1. Everyone wears masks, wears correctly.

2. quickly established contact tracing.

3. implemented successful public awareness/didtancing protocal called ""3 C's"". 3 C's are: closed spaces, crowded places, close-contact settings.

This article good write overall response: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Based assumption Covid airborne disease, masks going prevent anything? 

They're gaps masks... spread explicitly droplets, masks may good. players association release many players tested. fuck talking Sorry small spike accurate term. Perhaps short spike, terms length. idea predicates idea Americans learn wear mask take seriously. conversation logic. well others. individualistic stubborn. take ""infringement"" freedom orwellian nightmare. understand getting water splashed face waking fuck up. that's real re-opening would be. Classic redditor. ""How dare people isolate, saw (when isolating)!"" Right hit lost 100 pounds quit smoking. BMI hovers around 29 now. I‚Äôm still losing, feeling lot better amidst pandemic anxiety making change. corroboration [Singapore infected people stop infectious 11 days? said there's absolutely reason person wear mask unless sick. I've never heard number anywhere record Sweden 7th highest death rate per capita Covid world. Hardly something want brag about? Probably not, unless Scott Manley Neebs Gaming.... Transgenderism mental disorder called gender dysphoria. lost credibility point due coronavirus 'studies' anything related pandering. ever notice shit 'non binary' crap started years ago? slipperly slope last 20 years since started ""accepting homosexualism"" everywhere. kid 20-25 years ago, gays existed everyone knew it, ok parades open it. started allowing men dancing front children BDSM clothing 'pride month'. came transgenders. came 'non-binaries' million genders. What's next step degeneracy? Normalization pedophilia. 

If accept homosexuality transgenderism, logic dictates accept pedophilia. homosexuals fault sexually attracted sex can't help it, pedophiles fault attracted children. zoophiles fault sexually attracted animals. two still considered abnormal? declare pedophilia mental disorder fact normal call pedosexuals? pedo pride parades starts?

The media already slowly starting refer pedosexuals. wait couple years. Walgreens tomorrow tell Refuse even tell people fucking opposite well obviously going effective.

Imagine one beer really really bad health. advice president tell people drink ONE beer dangerous proceeds tell people drinking beer fine better shows strong free country is. thats happening mask USA No. need to. vilified silenced. adults charge listened facts.

Literally thousands people living proof well politicizing science worked country.

But yea, I'm sure armchair doctorate spreading memes knows what's up. ‚ÄúNobody ever went broke underestimating taste American people.‚Äù Except American people. suppose triage school send nurse to, send student home, send hospital. Fauci never promoted treatment Covid. He's talked slow spread disease clinically proven treatment vaccine. Trump promoted drug caused clinical trial abruptly halt killing people. lot easier hire (or brainwash) one ""2nd amendment people"" Trump said liked much?

You need one marksman, like Trump small target. China smart hell. They‚Äôre stocking dirt cheap oil pandemic panic. fucking late. idiots wearing freedumbs instead. They're going spread shit far wide. interested comment

Hrm, heard line reasoning before. May ask old are? thanx stater bros Albertsons? see people go without masks constantly stores. Like hard wear damn thing duration time shopping?

Business want make money üí∞

You Wal-Mart. :) 1000+ people day walk store pick

30%+- mask upon entering.

The 70%+- don't.

What easier, making someone watch door make people put on, possibly ending violence nothing.

Unless forced, business's usually choose cheapest easiest thing get away with. Fair, next. ahahahahahaha. Ahahahaha. fucking south park. ahahahaha. fair don‚Äôt think get visitors places days Wtf? months ago said face masks effective coronavirus. guy clueless really thinks highly wrong 90% time. ‚ÄúStop fear mongering, there‚Äôs thing covid.‚Äù Fully 1/3 working population filed unemployment. much worse Great Depression worst. can‚Äôt learn teacher dead. Big red flag mate understand, Fauci yes man, he'd fired replaced yes man. yes men awful. except Fauci. he's, smartly, waiting moment help fellow Americans, break rank. he's 80 we're lifetime pandemic, specialty, time right yet. maybe next time. stop sports testing players constantly. I'd bet money morally bankrupt fucks going push shoddy limited safety efficacy data. results disastrous quick payday political clout. Interesting times. like nails coffin keep coming. mention one biggest contributers destroying planet ocean. question started enforcing three Mexican super stores street Cali since first week orders. moronic. guess skipped reviewing evidence again. Clever. honest it, least. ""We shortage masks right now, ideally, we'd wear them. get one store, wear ASAP.""

Dishonesty never pays. shit Sherlock complicated. Many people getting much conflicting information know actually true. one listening president ( shit show is) still large amounts people listening false things leaders spewing. blame rise cases (in days) testing. capacity test longer blame rise testing. simple logic many people cannot grasp. Well least gets summer off. numbers interesting, still show 40-49 largest percentage people wearing masks. oh someone like listening logic. ends justify means here. Let get sand ear then... jesus christ Cool. given $600 every person year. what? can‚Äôt shit vote time comes. Fuck off! Baitin'! would MASKS important VIRUS pandemic?

Take look Korea Vietnam, wore masks, GOVERNMENT DEMANDED, DAY ONE. compare U.S.

We got short stick government experts, obviously. would DISCOURAGE wearing masks? Unbelievable. worst work. Sweden isn‚Äôt really testing much tho, absolutely think done death rate high simply don‚Äôt really test unless sick haven‚Äôt seen data support assertion wishing best you.

If there's positive side, got hospitals full. can. Keeping people next cubicles misguided ‚Äúoptics‚Äù gets people killed, like refusing allow store employees wear masks ‚Äúbecause don‚Äôt want scare customers‚Äù gets people killed. Everyone deserves workplace safety.

I work major retailer (at corporate) company basically sent everyone WFH fast, people cups snacks shit left desks. went back couple months ago get equipment desk, like fucking Langoliers. Everything still there, people anywhere. Fortunately, they‚Äôre still cleaning maintaining building, it‚Äôs like 4-month-old ham sandwiches trash cans anything. There's profit made they'll never

Quarantine rotted brain. bring Trump it? He's supposed supreme expert, failed.  could people put t-shirts around face would better did.

Horrendous mistake, cost countless lives. Every 100 seconds someone dies covid US least last weeks figures! know families convinced can't wear masks think shutdown problem, virus. drive 40 minutes small towns shop stores make wear masks. get coming from, wealthy, conservative, much political issue now? see Fox news numbers inflated non covid deaths assume actually happening? That's fair. past couple days pardoned Roger Stone posed Goya Oval Office. scientific evidence races equal physically mentally bet consider though racissssss right? Holy shit. 140,000 deaths Monday. Last weekend nearing 135k mark. Yikes It‚Äôs amazing went masks increase virus risk masks end pandemic weeks.

They assumed public stupid know wear mask correctly begging wear mask correctly make own. Democrats need push harder, corporate donors answer to. like get downvotes, answer. hardcore oposition here, friend! literally posted government-hosted clinical trial page, disinformation? It‚Äôs clear experiment parameters. !remindme 10 days Tons countries already wearing masks. He's supposed supreme expert shit. failed. say MASKS know answer?

But, rUShIN bOt! dumb. Effective lying important masks are? He's #1 reason dumb people think perfectly fine avoid wearing masks. March COVID 19 already devasted Italy. Sure, came senses irresponsibility start pandemic claimed many lives. 

If Trump Cuomo ever end prison negligent homicide, Fauci right along them. also lot complete dumbasses make six figures. Half battle people skills, luck know Think that‚Äôs insane? Homeboys blue danger going bankrupt cuz GOP policies since Nixon Era.

So, even get sick, might know way late spread bunch people. 

This really showing fucked average American is. anyone better way deal this, I'm ears. work sales. go make sales, get paid. get paid, can't support people depend me. Like, seven year old daughter. point wear mask, use lot hand sanitizer. think we'll getting help government handle shaping historically bad virus. People read century wonder hell doing. answer? Nothing! [Fauci + Obama] would've better tag team [Fauci + Orange Lying Idiot] money? governments leveraged little tax revenue can‚Äôt type mass funding want lot local government budgets already fucked way people reacted ACA serious right now? Americans love fucking someone else can, even would ultimately help them, especially someone else look like them.  fall happening lot faster Roman Empire. work largest hospital provider U.S., excuse horse shit. Supply lines would literally fire message make kind sense. I'm guessing parent provides health insurance? bill couple hundred thousand instead million?  think might be. mother law voice still sounds funny couple months later. never vent. have* Remember - Clinton Foundation's main work Haiti, worked reduce HIV rates. 

Trump utterly incompetent this, Hillary real experience leading organizations managed infectious diseases. Yeah right, Coronavirus already finished Florida... wait minute, surge Florida started weeks ago shows signs slowing down. way people get sick die point on... much global power line here. alot companies benefiting. must happy handing worst worst crown another Governor. Simply promising take ridiculously cartoonish irresponsible action somehow makes look good now. Good. Deserved Masks virus pants farts. someone farts bare ass way particulates blasted area. pants/cloth blocking stink hole, less able permeate through. stick head next butt jeans let rip one. still getting microscopic doo doo face. 

The staunch anti maskers ridiculous, agree. masks nowhere near bulletproof social distancing still best practice. mask worship getting really creepy. ruling class probably laughing us easy turn us anything. Currently hot right vs left debate us is...beans. Fucking beans. think kemp missed memo GOP abandoning Trump week. Guess wants go ship Nobody invincible butt flu tho , shit killed easy E cases never going get zero.

The point change actually want mitigation policies. countries fine keeping cases manageable levels, lower others, necessarily trying eliminate every possible case could happen. think sort attitude rampant among Americans we're many out-of-control outbreaks, frankly could easily prevented, opinions swing full extreme. unfortunate drawback critical thinking logic really taught States.  One neighbors CA says happened friend's relatives. told make Facebook video link Twitter sue shit hospital it. went weirdly silent... Home Depot following whatever local government says Monday. Pretty sure anti vaxxers believe in. Seriously, fuck draw line? letting incompetent leaders literally kill people. general strike? answer bad get there‚Äôs change? don‚Äôt understand this. can‚Äôt find reason. free. 

It could optics. it‚Äôs kind evangelical group Texas usually loves. Details guidance still hammered would aimed partly **discouraging COVID-19 patients completed home quarantine getting retested returning work school**, said Brett Giroir, assistant secretary health U.S. Department Health Human Services.

Yeah. Convenient. like jobs **require** get another test come back. lose job someone else gets UI funded 'didn't come back'. Unemployment goes down. Last time went like 2 employees wearing them. feel safe behind divider thing Sometimes shit still happens people make good life choices. Dad! He's pretty fucking badass...and 79 years old! long-term health effects HCW, headaches, arising impeded breathing? 
‚Ä¢ negative social consequences masked society? ‚Ä¢ negative psychological consequences wearing mask, fear-based behavioural modification? ‚Ä¢ environmental consequences mask manufacturing disposal? 
‚Ä¢ masks shed fibres substances harmful inhaled?


The real questions lol US behaved OK compared British Empire, Romans, Spanish, French, etc. definitely black marks polices need change now. need reign many corrupt evil forces government. However, world controlled Soviets Chinese dark one. need hold America accountable, America stays true principles, world good. 
The US needs lead example fear. Unjust wars undermine American credibility. American people need change that. means could getting whole new wave maskless morons videoing videoed throwing full blown temper tantrums public That's oversimplification people wanting fewer chemicals lives. support efforts remove harmful chemicals daily lives they're found everything massive number plastics use (and consume internally, unfortunately) well insanely long ingredients list chock full petrochemicals.

A good example Round people use lawns specifically says let kids pets play lawn. People treat harmless company declare - essentially ""on you"" misuse product. happens constantly. open electronics store price TV $1 use Best Buy‚Äôs price match guarantee buy TVs resell. still eat inside restaurant NYC. allowed drink bars. Gyms/movie theaters/etc still closed. haven‚Äôt bar since March 8th gym since March 15th. We‚Äôve also mask mandate since mid April. Sports spending money it. new record via worldmeters. +72,000. That‚Äôs fucking awful, parrot comment: thank you, nonetheless, wearing it. proud responsible protecting others even mocked you. You‚Äôre fucking awesome. makes sense. thought could rural communities less resources available. sad see many dying this, really even fully understand virus capabilities Wow Kemp really out-florida man-ed DeSantis.  noticing current hot spot sun belt. look mobility data, best quantitative data lockdowns, compare worldometer‚Äôs daily new case curves, zero correlation. Even CDC said zero correlation easing lockdowns case numbers.

However, look month got hot sun belt, spike happened. got hotter northern states, like Ohio trend followed. look Ohio average temperatures July Florida June. Ohio didn‚Äôt see spike month Florida, look daily new cases per capita Florida June, looks similar Ohio‚Äôs time July.

Now getting hot even northern states, seeing go improvements daily new case rate, first 7 day average increases. know thousands medical staff treating covid patients around country small percentage getting infected?

Yeah, masks work.

 fun paper physics guy, expert relevant field. happened days stay home parent? one spouse could work didnt one salary enough entire family business closures didn‚Äôt work? seem ignore underlying health condition called obesity.

Not fat shaming anyone else, myself; obese (33 bmi) trying lose weight since started better chances catch thing. one certain party leader broke system.

I know country ever recover either. think average person self administer injection Trump actually repeal law allow states priorities residents others.

I absolutely livid comes family member state fool give stop pay taxes state. Mauschwitz open (mexican here) testing people might COVID positive, either symptoms someone close (like spouse) tested positive. Make one white house Feel pretty bad LATAM brethren seemed situation control early spring completely shit bed due many factors. Sounds...soggy. fun. Trump petty. goal create destruction spite he‚Äôs insolent child. less 9%... lower rents eventually. Things get really shitty landlords, lords land bought shitty building, can't pay bills.  diehard fan going numbers high are. mean like multiple tests NBA players getting Disney bubble? perhaps ones college football players coaches fall rather calling season? Nope. We're gonna let person Covid-19 go back work without making sure still shedding virus. coworkers mother covid works Walmart. crazy even everything protect people around without mask got sick. time stores enforce masks laws security anyone get rowdy.  larger chain. WBA stock market friend volunteered hospital covid patients see sleepover friend like wtf? Tell womans family hoax, non mask wearing motherfuckers. still don‚Äôt understand don‚Äôt mandatory two week stay home. certain areas state. test citizen within area covid. stay home. Mark person need medical attention ship hospital. next area etc etc. Allow infected ones contact anyone except ones live inside home. must quarantined too. sick anymore go out. Mandatory mask glasses everyone. feel like America collective effort United, Divided always split middle. like Trumpster fire... ""It's good sense, age, brings wisdom.""
-P. Syrus B&amp;N sign saying masks required. checked mentioned appreciated sign wished they‚Äôd enforce many people maskless. told required mandatory. Really? Cause worked 5 days week contracted hours even made available night parents worked. answered phone calls texts parents 10 pm nights help navigate online platform. took personal time uncontracted hours video chat struggling students. parents claimed kids couldn‚Äôt got cam worked fine. kids playing parents, it‚Äôs transparent avoidance behavior. worked weekend plan week ahead. still responsible attendance, progress monitoring, grading, attending PST/IEP meetings, faculty meetings, grade level meetings, parental communication, actually teaching lessons daily webcam, checking understanding, reteaching filling learning gaps. stay home nothing. pay taxes support community raises policemen, doctors, teachers continue raise community. clearly clue talking about. Shame belittling one professions important country, dreadfully underfunded, compensated (despite requiring high levels education), appreciated. TOUCHING 2-3 weeks.

Edit: opened mesures relaxing they‚Äôre back closed. Makes Trump look bad. Man stores start everyone would used wearing mask now. reason people wearing gov‚Äôment said first thought üòÇ totally see Newspeak result government trying hide idiocricy keep control people sh*t goes behind curtain ignorance. ‚ÄúAggressive minority US behaves like spoiled toddlers‚Äù Agreed, lost many followers/friends Instagram posted quote go party like we‚Äôre pandemic. wish people weren‚Äôt taking situation lightly. Canadian Club here....it's pretty bad whiskey.

Agree everything else said, though. How? kind shit get people coming together, one, refusing okay game? How?*

*Rhetorical obviously fuck ton situations like nobody ever seems realize organization refutation/rejection way fix stuff.

Sorry. Again, absolutely mean sound asshole-y I'm sure do. guess I'm way fed up, frustrated, anxiety-ridden. I'm standing middle street yelling, ""join me, fix together"" folks looking windows waving... Yeah, since American visas blocked almost everywhere they‚Äôre flocking territories vacation   blatant propaganda I've ever seen it. virus peaking Southeast, happens seat largest population college football fans, also ironically leans conservative far. Oh, shits giggles, folks happen majority ""anti-maskers,"" lets blame president support scapegoat college football may cancelled... 
Not true (just extremely simplified), geez... blatant propaganda gift keeps giving Enough what, police? old saying, careful wish you, might actually get it. Cops kill 1k people every year . going long time. killed white. ""distressed"" going cause harm others. America saw happens correct overpolicing underpolicing. happened Baltimore Freddy Grey. Murder crime went roof. take genius figure gets disproportionate brunt that. seeing start happen cities American now. Minneapolis, New York, etc. Watch crime numbers world underpolicing. Police often ill trained quick use forc, game always cops robbers. Pretending robbers exist reality. LOL. Kemp doesn‚Äôt look good here. dad called today ask want go birthday Saturday. told staying home isolating given case increase risk. said he's pretty sure they're making numbers up. We're Texas, he's teacher. People taking seriously yet. Hopefully take widespread teacher student deaths drive home. That‚Äôs sad. Teachers undervalued society. wonder average American fucking moron. hate country much times spend half much energy fighting virus... People world looking America like, ‚Äúare you, though??‚Äù got free test said beginning pandemic lot Redditers jumped it. hate right sometimes. Keep mind likely faced *ton* pressure WH say things. We‚Äôre winning! dude! Who's got $5-10 thousand dollars put pipedream like that? description mom adorable. I'm glad finding ways manage. NY NJ. wish made drugs people legal. That's previous statements masks helpful started getting rolled back. personally jumped straight maskmobile everyone enthusiastic well never used past three months build federal stockpile, dumped billions vax research treatments, technically never left march forget rash. yesterday. hypothetically achieve herd immunity country‚Äôs zero cases open borders? Weird time known precautions COVID flu Fauci downplaying COVID saying protect flu. restaurants PA exactly this. pretend, else people would flee state droves... possible March, TONS cases realize NY? 

maybe *you* realize. think general consensus real number 10 x official one. Also it‚Äôs illegal unions strike contract expired. It‚Äôs see strikes negotiating contracts. Number new cases gonna increase it‚Äôll less two weeks. astounding Lol... nice. saying awhile. Freeze rent mortgages. Freeze credit card bills (certainly pay want, would). Pay every adult (even dependents college) $3,000/$5,000/whatever amount done it. It‚Äôs global pandemic. don‚Äôt care Bill Gates gets $5000 month, pay everyone. Get people eat pay medical bills. knew already. really exposed people care enough took away distractions (sports, new tv shows/movies, celebrity news, etc.).  Yeah lol. dumbass questions middle pandemic. never gonna get shit contrarian assholes like keep spreading nonsense like this. didn‚Äôt think anyone could get worse DeDeathwish. goal sex! Gotta go parties...! Sounds like lot Hey. wear mask prevent transmission deadly covid 19 virus currently spreading around. Regardless government says. reading live Florida, question. enough enough? need general strike. leaders failed you. It‚Äôs ridiculous keep going road. Stand take state back!  alarm sounded Italy, Spain, NYC, Detroit, etc? keep hitting snooze button hoping it‚Äôs magically weekend sleep in. Southern states sleeping rest us dying surprised bad gets. Vote politicians November. ""Realistically, vaccine take 12 18 months longer develop test human clinical trials. know yet whether effective vaccine possible virus.

If vaccine approved, take time produce, distribute administer global population. people immunity the¬†COVID-19¬†virus, likely two vaccinations needed, three four weeks apart. People would likely start achieve immunity the¬†COVID-19¬†virus one two weeks second vaccination.""

That's Mayo Clinic. timeline first sentence assumption regulators reduce requirements move future phases testing, according earlier parts document. could little concerning means testing long term negative effects may thoroughly tested enough for.

Then get second paragraph, entirely reliant last sentence first paragraph: even know permanent immunity even possible yet. history known coronaviruses, none every permanent immunity. either ""died off"" like SARS MERS, mutate get people sick year like strains cause common colds.

I'd rather realistic cautiously optimistic overly optimistic. Several experts also warning still know permanent immunity even possible.

Mayo Clinic source: Yes. quickly make happen? said anything else, there‚Äôd mass exodus state...  surprise there. also schools closed parents sending kids retired grandparents. 15+ kids homes day.  Ha. Tenino today, confirm they're wearing masks. Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) name disease.  
The virus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). remember unfathomable us reach 1m cases! 

The good old days gone.. something tell child boost self-esteem. Trump supporters fucking toddlers know liability know sister Pre-K teacher tells time idiot parents follow rules keeping kids home sick. Kid fever? Give Tylenol send school anyway. Kid fever? keep home they've 24 hours fever free, go ahead send school. really sucks, worked teet 2011-2014 experience. loved place, great pay great management. studied coronavirus family part getting PhD. He‚Äôs side immunity lasts months. corona virus strains don‚Äôt prompt strong immune response hardly antibodies made. new strain said previous strains pretty bad getting body produce antibodies. boyfriend, atm? pissed you? issue currently have? good look him.

And supporter. Gov. Abbott: Watch screw state up

Gov. DeSantis: Hold beer

Gov. Kemp: i'll hold reverse decision end next week. I'm talking political aspects book people reacted saddening close real life is. book deniers people intentionally got infected try prove ""hoax"" whole crowd people saying vaccine conspiracy, Governments enough, etc.

The comment replied referring count people shoot zombies there'd deniers covid. vetted boss guess... 30,000?! Can't wait see UT opening fall pans out... Every single car manufacturer pulled shady shit like that, Tesla pretty good far go 100% agree. see younger people fun, sure shit see middle aged-older individuals either crying freedumb. ""Need taxi? ax me. I'm Fauci."" - Tyrone (TPB)  Democrats arent much better. long two party country never good politicians. Crazy days president seen mask Walmart, Kroger, CVS, Target make masks mandatory. We've begging four months now. right. wife kids made homeless restaurants closed. fair. got fucked, hate everyone didn't, they're real enemy! Whales sometimes shit shallow side coastal shelves. Think deeper. wear masks saw people die. Also longer lockdowns. Businesses fail time. 

DONALD TRUMP's businesses failed time! campaigned ""running country like businesses"" went bankrupt 4 times! Imagine bigger piece shit governor Florida. Well idiot staying there. Maybe that‚Äôs staring ‚Äúthis dude mask riskin hisself round us, idiot man‚Äù Shhhhhh, ""no big government...except I'm power."" think ever hold food again. reasoning discussed Minnesota bought refrigerated warehouse bodies. said would tear after.

(I think used yet.)  every saved Covid life worth many thousand evictions? Way. To. Go!  I.Da.Ho! covid19 came Russian lab used attack China Putin (who hidden vaccine cure), would try appear eager get vaccine. would also wear hazmat suit public world leader has, reinforce idea really scared it. religious school likely long waiting list. parent saw coming thier kids lined get school. way late. live city mask mandate. technically stores already ""required"" places wear mask. cracks also restaurants open (50% capacity), means people eating food, salivating, talking 1 1.5 hours, tables limited 6 people per table.

Why okay maskless restaurant, smaller space, people nothing talk (sometimes loudly), okay go maskless grocery store...which much bigger, one hardly talking?

I love stores board masks time...but need agree masks are, now, answer...and would mean restaurants dine-in thing yet.

Get carry food. city even carry pre-made liquor drinks. Take home, get *a few* friends together, eat drink outside, safe distance other, gathered around citronella candle. 

I've done times. really nice. ramped up. 

But virus imagine Trump hair... face.. 

Yep that's happened US. discovered meth Trump, streets.

Hope get checked Dr Fauci's rehab soon reverse damage they've done themselves. That's case ANYTHING healthcare. clicked second study, conclusion masks help stop spread illness others ill, protect becoming I'll wearing it. literally CDC every doctor saying past months. Masks work stop spread, can't expect safe wearing one. wear one people, yourself. everyone this, would work.  place people seem issue wearing masks right US, everyone see that's working out. Went local Kroger grocery store today (Fred Meyer) Oregon employee lurking inside front door waiting stop people. see anything fun though literally saw 100% compliance there. even nose showing. pretty nice. Absolutely true. does, people made good choices backup plans place fall on. Even immunology researchers starting open eyes fastest growing discipline biomed research - aging biology, field bound profound implications healthcare transform medicine.

In paper specificaled called use rapamycin senolytics address aging biology Covid-19. 

[By far greatest risk factor Covid-19 mortality cumulatively independent risk factor ~800x, putative risk factors diabetes lung disease mere 2x risk factors. 

Unsurprisingly, related immunosenescence - targeting aging immune system strategy reduce morbidity mortality? anyone can't afford eat right now, please PM me. feed people. +940 deaths today...which actually fewer amount day last week, previous 3 weeks. Ofc ppl rather stay home understand regulations run business. think ""business making money = successful"" really simple. remember time invaded country take oil, still ended additional $1 Trillion debt. help country people way. 
At least people got something, like life. lol? couple wants move California make better?! Hahahaha! California way worse NY right now. We're screwed here. Good lord, Gov DeathSentence looks good comparison, know really fucked up. Depends benefit get businesses. Doctors? Nah, stay open, people gotta get fixed many die. Grocery stores same. Schools same. higher NY county reported crisis right? think highest single county daily number reported far. LA record.  happening lots different levels government. lack consensus creates confusion frustration. government supposed operate good faith. Overall empathy decline, yeah, definitely overall mentality. Edit: removed paid article, plenty articles regarding empathy decline false modesty now, please... Fair, would even effective country government actively opposing head epidemiologist. mean etk.? socks, shirt? Lmao Jesus.... kind insanity we're against... freaking comments! People insane going keep spreading shit. don‚Äôt understand. Businesses better chance staying open mask mandate place. Plus it‚Äôs mandate it‚Äôs better small business ‚Äúfollowing rules‚Äù. 
I don‚Äôt understand Kemp‚Äôs logic all. dont really see end well govt give fuck, tons tons people country also dgaf anyone besides themselves. directly effects them. Maybe. hand, could face crisis devising demonstrate quality leadership. seems like sound strategy win vote people. kind warning... like know coming... happened somewhere else before... course, Georgia experience first kind. many states illegal teachers strike. could stripped licenses.  fact qualifies ‚Äúgood news‚Äù would funny weren‚Äôt depressing Listening talk video, sounded like 70 yr old chain smoker. really living Information Age?

Excuse me! ain't Kno nuthin Hanety tails true. Oh goodness thank this... Best idea I've read far: Stores hire bouncers bars closed...big guys tough women scare bejeezus drunks. Plus, typically know de-escalate situation rather shoot people dead. 

Do also need move metal detectors doorways closed airport terminals even schools newly necessary policy GUNS store? haven‚Äôt HEB month. hitting Kroger Walmart. They‚Äôre focused money reason place open. seems like odd claim. Like electrician saying better physician. judge physician metrics importance electrician physician likely lacking, vice versa. Similarly, judge mink human standards likely lacking, vice versa. 

So claim seems like, instance, Ashkenazi Jews claiming better West Africans ethnic group Nobel Prizes. ever run 100 meters 10 seconds? 

My point always decide given group superior metrics use determination specifically favor group. doubt want align racism, align analogous form relevant here, namely speciesism? Deaths reported ‚Äúnon Covid pneumonia‚Äù say otherwise. loony obstetrician top virologist country? difficult choice.

Ron Paul knows much viruses I. mention, you‚Äôre sick enough need ICU bed, generally need right now. lot patients won‚Äôt survive transfer it‚Äôs far away, takes long coordinate. wish well likely result nonchalant sex seeking partying pandemic. Right seeing people‚Äôs true colors.  strikes? Ja [Texas Arizona importing refrigerated mortuary Tell deaths adding up? elect Trump starters. mean us already knew Trump going ef presidency voted in. 

Are really surprised things going way today ?

Trump's going go one worst presidents, probably even worse Nixon. pay passing grade harvard law school. Ok. I'm sorry I'm reading article Dr ""in style"", going fact based article, probably written soundbites Fauci said outlets. (If I'm wrong, let know, I'll read it)

That said, love guy. 6 presidents. knows shit. US administration actually listened man, instead making covid political statement. 

Sure made missteps this, (such masks helping), hey health advisors country say exact things. thing anything new. Yes thought 1 time, turns scientific data wrong. 

I hope keeps giving administration giant middle finger, goes giving interviews reputable media sources. dont want see shut up. voice reason right now. Tuition $500 month. Also Navajo Nation Hey never late turn around. gained 12lbs quarantine sucked ass, figured better start later. Dropped 15lbs counting calories &amp; walking/jogging. before, :) **'impending disaster'** disaster Cool Well, best buys match retailers prices like Amazon go buy things person there. That's weird, guy silent 20 million people protesting Read comments. you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs stupidity toxicity GOP. Dem governor science backed plan state GOP sued overturned asshole GOP majority state Supreme Court. local officials haven‚Äôt able put mandates state GOP/Supreme Court call unconstitutional. checks balances Wisconsin GOP passed lame duck laws, insanely gerrymandered shameful Supreme Court justices carrying extreme right wing agenda.

So hurray you! sane politicians live. Fuck GOP negligence playing politics fucking pandemic. Stop spreading hysteria 

It‚Äôs bad enough think they‚Äôre invincible ‚Äúflu‚Äù, like many sub... bust phrase 'lower whale shit.' HEB already requires it. started couple weeks ago, great, Texas, force people wear masks.... source: live Texas mom works HEB.

Since schools never closed Sweden (even cases swelling), good argument opening fall US? Yeah jerks volunteer hospitals covid victims want ""strengthen"" immune systems! give man sarcastic slow clap applause Honestly people simply uber entitled days decades opulence. fucking love pandemic exposing people. Finally hearing ""No."" lives. Children brain damage? Brazoria county month two ago say country could probably guess someone's political affiliation based whether think masks work ideally, one other? 

Also, countries returning pre COVID lives U.S. not? WFH? Lots us still talk like this. angry jerks get attention. :) Back day, county lines made, county court house within certain travel distance point county. weren‚Äôt cars back then. That‚Äôs mountain counties small.

That‚Äôs story goes, way. Could urban legend. Yeah, he's playing full deck. time passed shutting country option. way past point that.

People gone thru savings government never pay everyone enough survive without working. also deal even 2K month everyone help people live higher cost areas. Cough California Cough.

At point time need federal mask mandate. step car put mask felony. Thats needs done. all: competent leadership... Yes please hurt economic situations millions folks even time suppressing liberties. Wear mask, go business. Give worker medal (and raise!) Thx local insight Infections slow 25-40% also amount CDC said could die anything. Pro life Christians changing LIVES MATTER, scoffing wearing masks. Jesus returns, one's getting Heaven. First all, we're talking vaccine, cure. Second all, HIV exactly representative viruses. plenty viral diseases successfully prevented vaccines, including smallpox, chickenpox, measles, mumps, polio, yellow fever, rubella, more. someone DFW say half people don‚Äôt give shit yea, going vacation state acting like nothing happening shocked country 70,000 cases total?

Nope us called ""doomers"" start. beyond time stamp Republican Plague existence. #Donald Trump inspires American people prioritize families assets lives. Truly great leader.

- OANN, probably Good luck opening schools fall... paywalled, memorandum expire? Maybe aerosolized pheromones processed nose cells similar way scent molecules... That's really unfortunate, could imagine losing enjoyment food sex simultaneously?  kind sad ""look forward"" higher numbers means maybe people start take seriously.

Of course that's thought cases hit like 1,000 day... husband one children got Covid, less. Hasn‚Äôt flip flopped nearly every major position he‚Äôs taken? can‚Äôt think anyone who‚Äôs directly responsible lack trust authority terms coronavirus fauci updates discussion? Well happened predictions? 
Man hope finally makes difference. Props corporations stepping governments failing. Florida coronavirus capital USA right now, I'm still seeing 50% mask wearing record cases deaths showing results. walmart today people masks one obvious woman mask wearing trump 2020 hat. Figures right? Thankfully she'll forced protect people soon.. 2020.

About .75%

No way everyone get it. would start slowing maybe 25-40% Fox News doesn‚Äòt remember though Really???? 
After 2 million cases LMAO Uhh, understand concept New York City vs New York State, right?

And think US better Sweden, fucking ludicrous. Salt wound:  weirdest thing swedes talked thinks everyone else wrong even though neighbours lot better. Who's ever disposed anything properly except Zealots. 

Improperly disposed solar panels raises environmental concerns. CDC:


Cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates since March 1, 2020, updated weekly. overall cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate 107.2 per 100,000, highest rates people aged 65 years older (316.9 per 100,000) 50-64 years (161.7 per 100,000). could predicted? Well, rock. Rocks smarter southern governors many residents big big Christmas miracle Military leaders know history, role within constitution, balances duty country, paticular leader day. part training, and, critical thinking beyond politicians - cause strategy winning battles stuff. think that's going problem. Christmas time 2nd wave, lol Except often innaccurate No. might extinction levels paranoia intelligence though. think that's *only* reason surge. people (nonessential) stayed homes AC matter. know right? ELI5:

So people accurately describing major point tested injection vaccine muscle versus intranasal administration, intramuscular injection good, intranasal administration gave better protection airway lungs. intramuscular injection prevented major symptoms, intranasal method completely prevented infection all. 

Here‚Äôs part people might miss. isn‚Äôt normal vaccine like people used getting injected with, even like internal flu vaccine, basically weakened flu virus. vaccine packages DNA needed make SARS-CoV2 spike protein another virus, originally found chimpanzees, that‚Äôs engineered replication-deficient. they‚Äôre administering virus shell get cells make part COVID-19 virus, mimicking infection certain degree. Cells animal make protein immune system train recognize it. 

This somewhat similar mRNA vaccines tested now, ultimate goal vaccine get body produce part COVID-19 virus learn recognize it. introduces extra immunological challenge exposing person shell unrelated virus, could negative consequences depending dose whether immune system seen virus like one before. People largely abandoned adenovirus gene therapy patient went multiple organ failure died receiving adenovirus vector. Obviously wouldn‚Äôt using didn‚Äôt think safe, studies like use adenoviruses people much less likely react negatively to, personally wouldn‚Äôt want get vaccine like tested years. I‚Äôd get traditional one, even mRNA-based vaccine, tomorrow offered me. would sketch little bit.

You're throwing scary doom words. joke.

I'd recommend it, especially around others outside. [Fauci Dr. Carson got Misled public... *effectively.* guys please not? Also remember seeing earlier 5,000 doubt. river number times years. Helped amphibian research back day. Went last summer first time half decade completely different experience. sad. imagine like Covid.

(I guess could different river, there's one really comes mind)  must seriously demoralizing much education experience spend everyday getting sidelined imbecile. wouldn‚Äôt blame Fauci one fucking bit came like one day. read every single line point Fauci‚Äôs voice head I‚Äôm concerned mental health stupid dichotomy contrived... Yes understand that. Call new wave new surge, doesn‚Äôt matter. Either way look New York example kicked C19. took time, discipline, sacrifice unfortunately whole lot death. 

Now NY looking reopening consider fact disease exploded country people refused learn experience NY locations initially saw surge infections. 


Just like US whole refused learn Italy, Spain China before. 


This whole thing slow moving train wreck. Hate break you, ask input. know specifically this, quick search shows couple years back started building $245 million manufacturing complex Quebec go along another one US. 

Mind you, know enough field know that's big complex type thing. I'd like think developed vaccine could shared, that's probably naive.

Mainly noticed text groundbreaking kind freakily ahead time:

""The Quebec City production factory complement one Durham, North Carolina. allow Medicago position quick responder case pandemic situation influenza virus emerging infectious diseases North America. 

In centennial anniversary Spanish flu, claimed 20 million victims, advantage particularly important public health authorities event emergence new pandemic. ""

Two years later, yikes. time shut shit wait better treatments keep us going ER......  Europe. Lol Quite honestly, maybe understand socialism, but. know got $2k month, would (very happily might add) stop working live middle nowhere Kansas, frugally, painting Bob Ross rest life. even question head.

That's say middle ground here, objections really absurd? still found good answer incentivize slums - also people like - even work.  Sorry length, hoping get outside perspective here. 

My boyfriend's roommate tested positive COVID-19 Monday, June 29th. contact roommate contact boyfriend Saturday, June 27th. boyfriend got tested Tuesday, June 30th. tested negative, however self isolating since last saw 27th safe, boyfriend close contact roommate since moved weekend.

His roommate longer experiencing symptoms plan us start hanging together weekend. However, boyfriend's friends staying boyfriend roommates tonight. friends West Coast roadtrip past weeks want believe practicing social distancing guidelines, can't sure. boyfriend even wants let stay room bed sleep in.

My boyfriend saying although tested negative Covid-19 likely anyway since close contact roommate it. never felt symptoms may well asymptomatic can't sure. says since probably it, likely he'll contract friends staying them, carrying it. told reservations thought best wait two weeks sees us hang again. want isolate thinks we'll fine.

I currently sinus/ear infection prescribed antibiotics for. also asthma weakened immune system, trying cautious possible. know could many different outcomes still much know virus, would safe us hang even he's hung friends town? boyfriend one point, possible get reinfected? damn right spread out. explain underneath ‚Äúupdates‚Äù:

‚ÄúNOTE: Texas: Bexar County reported 5,501 cases today, 691 represent new cases, 4,810 backlogged, result ‚Äòkinks communication process state, cases underreported past two weeks‚Äô according reports citing San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg. 21 reported deaths also backlogged [source] Worldometer redistributed 4,810 backlogged cases previous 14 days based existing pattern Bexar County daily case increases daily record today due backlog unfortunately. lie though, masks. Gotta love &amp; picture shows future bright. get it, swine flu. cool heat map... get wrong, still sure that's actual demonstrative evidence. Yes, would technically accurate say Spanish Flu pandemic ended suddenly. small p-p Done? spans across socioeconomic strata even bridges political divides.

That's interesting. Leaves hospital oxygen tank. Fuck. remember gamefaqs :) Work home. Fauci rare white person age. see one confesses others medicine knowingly misled public efficacy wearing masks?  I‚Äôm Tyrone. endorse dude Fauci don‚Äôt like smoking either. HEALTHY MOTHA FUCKA mean, speaking teacher, we're getting paid get paid like 65% work do. can't tear gas way one. know he's right administration went far writing childish hit piece try make look bad, wrong it'd easy point economy needs go full steam ahead! Shovel old people pile!! ‚ÄúBecky‚Äù even health insurance? type job this? Oops, forgot makes friends DC tried that. he's going prison. Hospital admins Georgia government covering up.

this going month Especially young people could say enough enough, forgoe masks social distancing, generally fine, watch entire older generations America burn.

That's actual, viable option.

Not one I'd like see, generally speaking, best idea double blaming people actually largely immune Covid, category risk.

Kind like telling fire fighter full protective gear gonna ""turn heat"" threat. mean, okay, want? gonna end way think will.

From I've seen, least northeast, millenial GenZ friends taking whole ""protect others"" thing lot seriously older folks. to, are. continuing blame insinuate outright accuse enough, especially given state country right now, kinda dangerous game... wanted see manager. due modesty....

YEEEEAAaAAAaaaaHHH  weight loss help enlarged heart, stand alone thing? weigh viewing - I'm trained physician could totally wrong I'm positive optimist so... irrefutable evidence otherwise?

Every portion pound much safer. Every step taken better. like, 5lbs lighter, needed 7lbs hit ""obese"" vs morbidly, still 5lbs lighter! Every action positive, keep awesome job! Keep healthier version!

If it, it. didnt, hopefully version get proportionally less severe would (or nothing all, cool too.) could also she‚Äôs trying avoid spotlight trusts Fauci handle better esp since Fauci seems handle Trump better people directly contradict dumb shit says Similar school district. teacher friends last week concerned remote learning challenges spring - told school admin prepare teaching person A/B schedule modifying curriculum accommodate less classroom time home assignments (we typically homework school). Never mind district released plan administration guessing prepare for. Also never mind fact district pay teachers summer 2 4 basically like ""we time idea need it"" (which really blame prepare something might happen). asked ""what remote again?"" agreed way would be. would like whatever smoking. Shame Andrew Yang go sold corporate dems Biden inserted. I'm sure Yang came along months later UBI, he'd win sure. downvotes? Lol what‚Äôs fuckin baglog?!! Well, educate us, *does* study say? opposed travel bans. said risk Americans miniscule. said wearing masks silly. get anything right? might lose base physical attrition. Contrast am. Live Hong Kong. Everyone wears masks. Schools practice social distancing, though closed right nearly 100 new cases. Work Shenzhen, again, everyone wears masks schools practice social distancing. people, completely different government styles social states understand responsibility behave way helps reduce threat Covid 19.

And see states, suddenly easily led trailer park brigade derailing every attempt slow this. would say someone needs slap sense them, would advocating violence, would take lot slapping even get stop shouting rights freedumbs. Karens gonna PISSED!! opposing science.

That statement legit cringe. *All* science? Really?

Bruh Best wishes, Indian friends. I'm sorry growing like country, top places hit hard.

Be strong hopefully side sooner rather later. Yah - Biden Hanks not. categories medals. Hanks received one Film &amp; Theater category. 100 actors could got - he's fine choice (2 Oscars, 8 Emmys, 4 Golden Globes, activist many great causes).

able afford give everone $$1200 checks like Trump Texas hospitalizations seems plateaued (so far) around 10,500 past days. Wonder things slowing hospitals running room? 5 eyes?

Yeah read comments I've made thread say mad people making more, happy them. I'm happy system people running it. would cite numerous recent articles prove masks fact save lives, know read them.

Edit: people imagine anyone capable self swab test, let alone j random tester medical training know far back edge brain is. Republican Government.

It's still important distinction always get flu shot there. Cheapest area insurance doesn‚Äôt cover it.  Fuck Chuck. Cheap would guess spent 80 days hospital, would regret wearing mask I'd spit republican. growing ? must admit looking hospitalisations makes reporting great (testing seems variable based policy settings )

No doubt experience making lot careful well Thats great news cause Target area wasnt shit masks even though city passed mask requirment. disagree. Social media pushed us different trajectory Disney wants money LOL. Oh man. It‚Äôs impact remdesivir dexamethasone Yeah, absolutely!

In case maybe instead direct payments instead gov act middle man: want pay rent landlord gov pay u 

Just spitballing since think levelled playing field worldwide country wewould lose lot luxuries Sadly, happen Biden White House. sure could done Executive Order. dumb ass Federal Judge would even block smh 20% hospitalization rate; 5% chronic illness; 1% death. 

No way hell children going school amount stupid people still thinking hoax going around. went take baby 15 month shots, receptionist medical assistant werent wearing masks, m.a. complaining one calling saying felt sick too. obviously walked out. im going expose family interviewing pedi practices time (texas). commenters say drive thru 100% right. division routine vax sick baby visits. you‚Äôre Spain don‚Äôt think so, least hope not! like captain ramming ship iceberg hoping doesn‚Äôt sink.

It‚Äôs like people excitedly getting high scores favorite video games something. get it, still quite sure why. setting good example, where's mask but, ""other people wear masks"" includes take look perspective?

you make sense, bro wear god damn mask. say ""Wear face covering,"" like we're now. they're effective, recommending back then? shortage bandannas makeshift masks too? post removed cannot verify reliable source.

^ brain Trump chode juice I'd rather people wear masks protect other. work way around (protecting contracting covid), *especially* 50%. does, provide source claim. hoping ask India, like right now? World-o-meter shows obvious ramp up, second one maybe US...and still maybe given obvious looks India. said, like 1.3 billion people so, meaning million infected entirely different thing say US. 

So above, someone india view something avoided (but still much control can), or, like US beginning horror movie? Would really appreciate ground stories it, course everyone going follow every rule! But, huge difference florida today italy worst, far people following rules goes. actually. said dont wear youll touch mask anyway. Risk rewards.... ;-) reckon cancel trip get money back. spent fortune understand, put price health around come home.... Never stated big business, never said PPP available fuck come percentage? lifetime crisis every 10-15 years.

Reddit hard Fauci man made huge mistakes, fits administration well. wonder Trump administration‚Äôs decision remove data collection CDC send ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù D.C. means one last days real numbers US see. isn‚Äôt joke fauci Source? wrong side history, friend. Putin know. dont get fawning guy. exactly right? Everything advised wrong. said caused harm use... Fauci say people shouldn‚Äôt wear masks ineffective? science socks really need research whether masks work not

Yes need research know something works. That‚Äôs research is.

No one said masks useless though. Establishing policy mean shit, enforced leave retailer. need police step enforce mask policies. crisis basically over. new daily numbers pure politics. Russian government-owned propaganda media organization. would wait other, reputable, reports believing article. Paupercide ~~IM NEVER SHOPPING AGAIN!~~

IM NEVER SHOPPING AGAIN! position dealings Fauci. Good luck, man, push fluids get low dose aspirin pulse oximeter. Rest much can. Testing flawed anyway. go assumption it. super easy get anything risky either thought safe mother coffee park. Hang there. Take deep (really deep) breaths nose cough really hard it'll bring pulse ox up. tell ""lost cause"" set. now, ones like making displaying statues literal traitors committed literal treason.

Not joke. Confederacy refuses die. die.  I‚Äôm symptoms what‚Äôs point tested vs self quarantining feel better plus two weeks? Serious question Let guess, excess deaths mostly: pneumonia, influenza, stroke Translation:

The reality going die, us COVID us something else. saying ""there time visit later blows over"" something might well true. *scratches nuts* jock itch say? Yeah bros, told back april working covid ward Spain. unlike anything else. hospital normally 350 beds, 12 ICU, medical specialties(trauma, etc). peak 550 ward, 55 ICU. covid, mean beds. 7% city antibodies weeks after.

Not fun facts: 

A total 1300 patients hospitalized city.

25% false negative test results.

35% died.

Most deaths 75 years. also worked Woburn find completely unsurprising Stop blaming inability understand clear language failure communicate part WHO.

You're arguing technicalities. Maybe scientists care technicalities, general public cares official recommendations. bottom line is: issue recommendation general public wear masks covid? That's make difference saving stands recommendation wear masks sick caring someone ""There specific evidence suggest wearing masks mass population potential benefit. **In fact, there's evidence suggest opposite** misuse wearing mask properly fitting properly,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director health emergencies program, said media briefing Geneva, Switzerland, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, infectious disease epidemiologist WHO, also said Monday's briefing ""In community, **we recommend use wearing masks unless sick** measure prevent onward spread June 5 issued recommendation general public wear masks. one interpreted way, that's fault, major news organizations reported thing, blame failure World Health Organization (WHO) changed advice face masks, saying worn public social distancing possible help stop spread director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Friday ""in light evolving evidence, advises governments encourage general public wear masks widespread transmission physical distancing difficult.""

Southerner Derangement Syndrome. must humidity something. effective? US us getting fucked virus. link CDC saying masks increase virus risk?

I remember individual idiots saying things, usually misinterpreting edge facts, CDC. main point businesses needing PPP still getting it. Chill out.. say is, ready prepared much family fall. Nobody coming help us, own.  Let's stop pretending neoliberal/corporate Democrats innocent here. Blocking cornavirus. /r/PlantBasedDiet 

....and watch Gamechangers Netflix.  anyone know Median age went up? impression mostly young people hell many get infected, cuddle breaks? golf course FFS. huge portion employees outside majority shift. aren't. took screenshot numbers reported deaths Google yesterday data changed.

But simply dismiss every single bit science favour political bullshit... dang. federal government implemented testing contact reaching program locked down. blasted ads masks mandated them. needed done lockdown reopening could done safely. None was. locked nothing make sure could reopen dishonest anyone say lockdowns work. work sacrificed government fuck take pandemic. Basically group self-serving imbeciles thrive conspiracy deny anything sciency. started research development worked way regulatory affairs/compliance went co founder 2 different pharmaceutical companies later life. He's retired industry.  profit person receiving money spending it? agree threat possible fine makes HUGE difference. Michigan Governor toughened mask mandate Monday, claiming wearing one mean $500 misdemeanor crime businesses enforce found complying face risk losing liquor licenses operating licenses. 100% people wearing masks local stores since Monday (except one person saw Walmart). public roads socialism mean Feudal empire Germany (or would become unified Germany) socialist public roads? so, socialists 1800's notice this?

Fucking joke. Overall, agree you. know reduce spread infected others. Everyone wear one. 

But OP claimed masks allow 65% reduction contracting virus wearer. seeming suggest 10-20%. Again, anyone around source average makeshift cloth surgical mask protects COVID-19 particles enough even matter? No, that's fake news. Certainly studies yet - personal guesses based experience university also parent babies born 27weeks 32weeks respectively? infant late preterm good lung function birth, *maybe* potentially like slightly fragile term baby (they crash faster things go wrong, less resilience systemically). infant early preterm micropreemie, *maybe* potentially terribly. Lung function number one concern infants likely already intubated CPaP etc. There‚Äôs pretty much wiggle room respiratory decline them, they‚Äôre already walking line needing ton support. 

PURE CONJECTURE, this. anyone evidence-based insight, experience thinks related research question, I‚Äôm ears. obvious underlying accusation blaming Fauci I'm Trump guy.

In reality, I'm blaming Fauci deserves it. one job, fucked up, badly. /r/everyfuckingthread

I think that's last one, done here? like 45% California actually Republicans?

My concern people cherry pick one overly hawkish opinion one group use imply everyone wrong overreacting. let's clear, one group seems gotten wrong kind evidence everyone concerned Sweden's approach wrong.

It still holds Sweden 7th highest Covid-19 death rate. 5th highest factor likely statistical anomalies presented low population countries Andorra San Marino. regardless opinion one group researchers, reality Sweden suffer disproportionately high death rate also nations shown disdain efforts minimise threat virus also appear high table deaths per capita. also, politicizing mask wear

wear not, give shit, stop spewing non sense Wearing mask won‚Äôt help, everyone wears mask helps fair, probably already food. know seen thr kitchen food insecure American, us casually keep weeks worth food houses, especially children. panic buying food pushing months instead month food idea I'd sending impoverished family. I'm gonna say I'd feel way worse accidentally infected parent died rather died see me.  next week Florida. Racist garbage? realize scientifically proven whites higher IQ blacks, blacks higher muscle mass, whites typically taller asians, different bone structure, etc. identify race bones alone. Races breeding groups, separated geographically, adapted environments. say races say poodle mastiff different. sure socialist particular opinion, ok. I‚Äôd say since became major right-wing talking point, Dr. Fauci began fall Caesar‚Äôs good graces, would probably suffice ‚Äúbeing called it.‚Äù go blood really want. point 2 ...

let's say, Joe expels 1 million virus particles

so saying, mask block would end respiratory system?

you realize *reduced chance* means? link article video, subtitles translate Text article - less spoken... youtube subtitles - 

I think best translate article. looks older maybe mix something fairly sure somewhere mentioned 35 36

Stay safe Meanwhile, **Foxnews one covid19 story webpage** No. You‚Äôre cutting middle man nobody thought asymptomatic transmission possible virus yet. Even so, even know surgical/cloth mask would make difference, N95s necessary. could advocated masks safe, *weren't enough masks* healthcare workers, much less general public.

They situation changed, stance changed it. can't ask anything better scientist. instincts say everyone else? Makes optimistic kids future leaders country. Almost always, bitching socialism understand it.

And almost always promoting socialism never grew socialist country. there, done that. instance, anti socialism, still drive public roads? send kids public schools?

Your logic make sense would prefer roads taxed per-use basis people actually use pay them. course I'm going use public roads government forces pay taxes them. never came said ‚Äú promise never lie you‚Äù

Annnnd [I‚Äôll leave agree 100% read comment intending diminish anything. things true equally important remember aware evaluating particular situation. arent going McConnell made clear. mind handled great, need reopen everything.

Hell, could go back time would happily pass first $1200. reason agreed thought would good photo op Trump effectively bribe people go trump2020. loved seeing mask requirement signs target today, alongside customers wearing mask! dropped mic hard lockdowns outbreaks. Sweden implement social distancing, closure schools closure large events well contact tracing outbreak occurred. 

Preemptive measures better reactive ones. Obviously. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! Sigh. People keep repeating half truth. never said one wear mask. said people symptoms wear masks, people sick help need reserve masks need like healthcare workers. actually wrong, except know lots people virus without showing symptoms still infectious. now- everyone wear mask know might infecting others. still effective protecting someone sick, someone sick wearing one, helpful. see difference? Revised recommendations new information. science works! get shit. comment definitely never gets old. life important.  *novel* virus going come lot unknowns. We're learning go. 

Not mention beginning trying maintain sense professional courtesy Trump, contradict him. interrupt vomit protruding violently anus boss spoke of. 

Now he's putting foot he's getting shit it.  A) CDC Oxford. 

B) say Vaccine, mean attempts make one trial one done. 


C) say 5 years, testing MERS vaccines while. massive amount protests/riots couldn‚Äôt helped. masks don‚Äôt work medical professionals would use them

How type without realizing obviously something anyone ever said lmao USA! USA! may socialist, ""they"" instance means people demonising health expert who, accounts, done nothing best. Literal shitloads people pushing narrative described

Stockholm approach herd immunity

UPDATED TODAY 09:21

PUBLISHED TODAY 07:47

Immunity covid-19 high 40 percent Stockholm. shown new calculations Swedish Public Health Agency, FHM. Thus, so-called herd immunity close.

Lately, signals people starting relax comes corona. Despite this, number patients increasing. According FHM, may indicate number immune systems Stockholm large means spread infection reduced.

According FHM's CEO Johan Carlson, proportion people antibodies so-called cells Stockholm 40 percent, twice high rest country.

- positive much suggest way, says DN.

If figures correct, Stockholm approaching flock immunity arises 40-45 percent population longer infected, according previous calculations Tom Britton, professor mathematics Stockholm University.

The entire world fell victim china

They ones reporting it

They imprisoned whistleblowers

They imprisoned doctors publicized virus

They literally sent announcement virus wasnt transmissible

THEN entire world announced it. 

Thats CHINAS FAULT fuckwit. 

China lied ENTIRE FUCKING WORLD think trump. 

My comment history isnt sexist racist. Youre mindlessly stupid piece shit lies cant accept truth.

Everyone agrees you- china virus chinas governments fault. 

Its funny care human rights protect china- number one violator human rights. 

Its also funny facts evidence china lied virus reported still blame US. Let‚Äôs look normalized generalizations women:

It‚Äôs rape it‚Äôs husband. 


How many women victims rape later gone rape murder men? sad reality women life sexually assaulted before. Ask mother, sister, aunts, friends. Ask man ever violated without consent.

You don‚Äôt get use imaginary hypothetical fears future world justify maintaining oppression women.

You realize women already live world like that? saying don‚Äôt want happens women happen you?

You know would combat fears? ally male feminist. Knowing male feminists exist help give women hope heal. shutting rant trauma exacerbates situation reinforces narrative. Again, rhetoric oppressor meant separate us.

Educate everyone spend ***1%*** effort Greatest Generation World War II, beat thing. Sadly, become real way idea true spread it‚Äôs becoming LOT harder get tested here... time White House getting control hospital data. blinding us, ultimately blinds state leaders scientists need data order make decisions.

They know what‚Äôs coming fall winter attempt hide real numbers political economical reasons. 2 cents anyway. else would dramatically slow testing take control data? owns website? secret? anti-maskers take strength people wearing mask. get people wear masks necessary, also means sometimes wearing unnecessary. 

At least, one around neck show mask put road crossing option. likely won‚Äôt. that‚Äôs issue. States rarely actually pursue charges. issue staked territory includes facts. Democrats believe science, education, critical thinking. Republicans staked opposite positions. can't agree basic facts situation, can't get along. say sky green, say blue, long keep insisting green there's simply way come accord.

The trap thinking impasse sides' fault. not. One side rejecting evidence, data, facts. side not. one party blame hyperpartisanship right now, party calls covid liberal lie. Yep, roughly 8,000 per day that's counting covid Texas school academic/sports league (UIL) allowing kids distance learn participate in-person extracurricular activities. Avoid virus classroom get packed dozens kids adults evening.

No, 'Europeans' didn't. us England know politics politics, politicians worse others, necessarily much sway days. Electing someone like magically turn nation something like something like. And, plenty politicians every country Europe really like.

This obsession United States politics embarrassing. event interested politics 'the right thing do', matter country hail Europe undoubtedly plenty doorstep get grips with. depends define ""false negative"", suppose.

If ""false negative"" means person virus takes test gets negative result false negative, yes, occur.

If ""false negative"" means cells actual virus swab test still returned negative, rare.

The trouble swabbing respiratory infection lot like swabbing skin fungal infection, can't see rash trying swab. instantly everywhere nasal passages. Lol touch√© say it, hypertension/obesity played larger role. Yep that's state dumbass governor. always look like he's wondering shit pants not? asshole. Anyone chose attend large wedding right likely infectious average likely taking risks too. People careful going. bride groom respectfully approached asked kind measures would feel safe comfortable with, making clear would respect decision matter what, would good opportunity share willing do, honestly anything would favour obligation. expect risk health sake big day without asking input pretty clear assholes are. Ads? removing search engine? idiots going kill people dis-information terrorist bomb. Rip üíî ‚ÄúPeople antibodies, antibodies waning quickly.‚Äù antibodies diminish, ‚Äúthen good chance immunity vaccine would wane too.‚Äù

I get it. much want good news hope 100+ potentials promises many vaccine coming spring... summer... fall... winter... early 2021, accept reality extremely low. 

Like article states, make sense move treatments (while still trying miracle vaccine). virus whole different monster anything humans modern history seen.

Herd immunity may possible obtainable. Vaccine may viable. end true, do? much besides treatments, guess.

Still hoping miracle vaccine... also understand may never happen 2021 2022 vaccine sustainable lasts (rather get vaccine every 3 months forever). would hurt everybody state, even reddish states lot us wearing masks trying survive. savvy move. think sheep yet awoken higher state understanding. one day will.

Then maybe sheep, parroting arguments neither us came with. us believe right just, end day, truth impossible actually find. Unfortunately dementia already huge amount medication she‚Äôs already supposed taking never remembers to. Might well try, I‚Äôm doubtful would.

Thanks advice tho never could good response. 40% population die rather let violate rights protect them, sort quarantine impossible. I'm sure news reporters know potential vaccine immunity researches working tirelessly get vaccine up. vaccine didnt provide immunity, short immunity, would researchers still working vaccine.


Maybe fading antibodies doesnt mean longer immune virus, body keeps antibodies around short while, body doesnt forget make antibodies. DUH hatred party, due part party spouting hatred large portion population. Also, think Democrats actually value you, conned well.  frogurt.  Protests actually cut transmission. Paradoxically, people stayed home scared. Whole foods starts monday Seriously. fucking cunt. 

Going around, swearing internet. fucking mother found reading SMUT. impossible figure own. Look comparable sales area, assume 30 year mortgage look annual tax burden. Also ever bought homeowners insurance idea much would cost per year. much. can‚Äôt imagine CA Arizona border gets lot traffic tbh It‚Äôs dumb. There‚Äôs pandemic months, country shut down, 100,000 Americans died, told father would susceptible yet went anyway. He‚Äôs selfish piece shit that‚Äôs it. They'll try hide numbers too. Hell, they'll probably try fuck census numbers hide many died.   sadly hispanics blacks statistically likely affected higher rates Yeah know, virtually impossible baby's todlers Mask = 6 ft 6 ft below, choice. Maybe???

Iran 30th place deaths per Iraq 40th. Yeah don‚Äôt understand ‚Äúlogic‚Äù all. later article quotes reaction, saying media took statements context.

‚ÄúI said: 'The science clear this...the science side here. encourage localities &amp; states simply follow science. Open schools,'"" McEnany wrote. ""But leave media deceptively suggest making opposite point!""

But doesn‚Äôt make sense... said ‚Äúthe science stand way of‚Äù schools fully reopening. quote stats peer nations whose schools reopening, without comparisons numbers cases; mentions studies COVID apparently less deadly kids flu (but bringing suit back parents?). IMO can‚Äôt really say media get her. science cherry picked data might side, doesn‚Äôt mean shit reality. that's design. people rightfully irritated fact OSHA *can't* care - problem OSHA can't better situation themselves, that's political overlords really care. 

Safe working conditions cost money prioritise those.  Well worst year time period Asian flu 1957-58 killed estimated 69,800 US average year half many quick math would say 698,000. current rate without growth, COVID would hit 10 months. R/nottheonion Ah, good question. much stock put intent vs outcome? run child accident, despite lacking intent, still cause (grievous) harm, need held accountable.

But emotional damage (if put way) kind trickier line walk. certain political party feels damaged serve gay people. So, even though intent, believe still damage done (even believe they're full shit). we're talking taking offense draw line intent outcome? 

I honestly know answer that. might end ""I can't define pornography, know see it"" situation, really sit well... LOL wtf problem? Honestly, unfortunate that, make worse.

If one people catches COVID, hospitalized, put critical condition, ventilator- ventilator works, come alive, leave hospital, they're cured: change opinion even come close death. They'll think ""See? COVID survived. proof COVID hoax worthless mask bullshit. survived COVID, anyone survive it. widdle cold, bother bullshit."" says need one feudal lord? brilliant democracy capitalism! Stupid ass kid..I'm sorry vote want listen parents know lived you.that kid going live fact brought home god forbid killed dad..im praying hard family  person observation resident California 10 years now. whole surfer/beach bum crowd small part population, people places extremely wealthy even remotely fit demographic. upper-middle class suburbanites see Houston, Austin, cities type people see around California.

I'm camp definitely thinks going cause lot harm fully open schools back fall, lot things consider outside Covid. keep schools closed, need find way pay parents stay home children, allow computer rentals families may able afford children complete online education, provide meals many low income children rely schools provide.

Not entirely same. r/Coronavirus makes anxiety skyrocket. Fast forward: ""US begins land assault invasion United Kingdom."" I'm right now. Friends invited times events like 4th ain't risking it. Plus mother suffered stroke open heart surgery past Canadian, believe border closed least end 2020.

State governments already caught red handed trying manipulate numbers downplay bad gotten. fully expect Texas things far worse numbers they're reporting. escalated quickly luxury hunker down. Big garden, 2.5 acres, play dawg, read, shit like that. But, I'm feeling bad local businesses. go - anywhere. many people wear masks right tolerate bullshit. many businesses requiring employees wear masks. Fine, people want reasonable, stay home send money community. We'll see things six months unemployment checks stop flowing. Hopefully get vaccine sooner later. Masks actually look cool though. 
You tell would make wedding unique stand pandemic. bride groom could show unwavering love one another truly challenging times wearing one. could also photos event select friends family right? entire wedding party exposed once. 


Plus, masks ugly. bride groom always customize masks get inspiration photos: know I'm son, pandemic wedding everyone wearing mask seems incredible would great story tell future generations. Listen science. Pretty fucking simple, right? fAuX nEwS oRaNgE fLu hOaX tRaIlErS!

Glad know lives worth promoting political agenda idea. 
As far national guard, mean situation getting bad many places once... 

But still. insane abbot turned offer help area clearly struggling. We're failing medical workers beyond belief. everyone could wear mask, would reason close stores down, millions people unemployed could become homeless!!! wonder over/ odds @ Vegas Weak! Low effort! oh unpaid football players!!! We've waiting point come still can't believe it... way, he‚Äôd admit attractive black woman scary city right. He‚Äôll sooner see 10k georgians die every day admit right.   Never thought see happen eh? too, genius compared them, feel good Mr. High IQ. step fuck run things

yeah, really amazing they‚Äôve stepped run things crisis

young people aren‚Äôt responsible fact dnc continually puts stale neoliberal candidates supported donors stakeholders. idea grassroots movements could immediately effect real change country tried harder completely ignores power dnc, media, institutions selecting candidates really need national convention. Biden can't beat Trump going right now, entire Democratic party disband.  Yes. Keep dismissing it. feel like monster thought slips wish worse maybe would wake-up call. turns questioning kind person am. Tomorrow: ""The White House pleased report ZERO COVID cases ZERO COVID-related deaths"" much paid insurance?

Yeah anyone thinks corporations care safety guests employees incredibly naive. want get cash flowing quickly possible. set account barista- otherwise WOULD control funds. thought public-shaming barista, someone else set go-fund-me tip him.

here's thought- two together get-go..? going need them. Honestly cases declining rapidly opened everything early. lockdown worked worked well - didn‚Äôt...finish like places did.  achieved small amount cases per day invested contact tracing would able truly get back normal (with masks) open schools soon. 8.5% hell lot closer 3.7% 24, 44%, 67%. saying call tell constituent would like voice opinion &lt;insert tell opinion hold it. Pessimistically speaking, Trump gets re-elected continues presidency, next four years Doctor Fauci would depicted incompetent official everything failure caused him. HHS Parent organization CDC. deal wide variety issues. CDC nominally branch focusses disease, research practical measures. data handling. Removing data flow routing rest department kind of... bewildering. private company, Teletracking, tasked datahandling, awarded no-bid contract according NPR. far aware, datasets open public, least found easy means access site.. Ok, read source. testing data confirm consumer mask blocks infective particles inhaled. evidence parties masked reduces infection. Eighty days hospital? COVID set prospects financial stability back least decade more. medical system beyond fucked up. ""Each day facts get worse,"" said. ""If slow disease quickly, hospitals get overrun, fear even inflict people I'm talking right now."" say now, November you‚Äôve seen dead bodies prison breakouts riots food shortages aren‚Äôt going want anything live another day whose president won‚Äôt something even radar.  He‚Äôs planning this. He‚Äôs forcing it. it‚Äôs already happening.  hope I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm mail ballot, knows. probably tell Biden skip don‚Äôt fuck many videos realistically watched?

That's exponential growth folks. 

Maybe week, certainly think we'll see 100K cases day next week. sadly, may also see records death count. Likely seeing anywhere 1,000 2,000 deaths day rate. Really sad. Could avoided.

Hmm ... dunno agree that. Sweden's 40% NY (state) popoulation, high point 1,800 cases (although also data dump day ... real peak probably around 1,500). NY bunch days 10k peaked almost 12k. point ""flattening curve"" keep peak low. I'd say Sweden much better job NY. Better U.S. states fact. seems excessive. Aldi Market Basket Whole Foods probably, one large grocery chains rest follow suit. show trends positivity rates. Data like important find hotspots get resources moved around. sample 5000 100% positivity rate city 500k would mean resources need allocated since majority population it. 5000 positive 10k tests outbreak widespread region. Smaller data sets used analyse trends larger population thing. Scary support data manipulation non reporting. 78,201 covid metrics right now. might break 80,000 tomorrow next week. damn advice mask-wearing changed lot, true. I‚Äôm inclined believe lies likely linked politics administration. It‚Äôs natural update medical recommendation based new evidence (and certainly evolving social contexts). Initially fear virus easily transmissible via airborne route versus droplet, would make homemade masks even plain surgical masks ineffective. still transmitted way (my hospital still mandates airborne precautions we‚Äôre caring suspected confirmed COVID patients), maybe (public health officials, scientists) underestimated good makeshift masks could average citizen socially distancing etc.

Nevertheless, don‚Äôt think Fauci ever intentionally said anything sinister intent, it‚Äôs understandable going back forth confuses upsets masses, bunch people spitefully refusing adhere latest recommendations. know, hospitals submitting data CDC anymore. goes directly White House sanitized.

So, claim article analyzing Florida‚Äôs death pneumonia count much higher right previously time year.

According Politifact, claim made drawing conclusion using two different sets data shouldn‚Äôt compared.

First, data 2013-2018: number people die due pneumonia around time year question usually around 900 Florida. deaths pneumonia ultimately killer counted dataset.

Second, data 2020: Politifact says data used complete claim Florida‚Äôs pneumonia deaths includes people died different cause (the flu COVID) happened pneumonia time.

The difference pieces data subtle important: around 918 people usually die time year question strictly pneumonia; 2020, time year, thousands people died pneumonia, pneumonia may underlying cause death.

At glance, CDC‚Äôs dataset aligns Politifact saying. haven‚Äôt done much digging, though.

Additionally, spoke chief CDC‚Äôs Mortality Statistics Branch.

The issue Politifact ranking claim ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù also note actual number deaths pneumonia period time 2020 won‚Äôt properly categorized months later - really don‚Äôt know deaths strictly pneumonia really not.

I hope helps! able go football games masks.  fire people Apprentice another room.

There debate things. happened. Immediately. Yeah, good point. read seem emphasize dining areas Sounds like also it‚Äôs wrong call out, also call story correct, it‚Äôs glossing facts.

Good mod. I‚Äôve heard argument sides, wether it‚Äôs forcing people lockdown forcing people lockdown mental ‚Äútorture‚Äù.

Either way, sides need seriously reevaluate consider torture frankly, it‚Äôs embarrassing even compare actual torture victims go through. Given obesity rates US unusually high south, states largely opened business early mandate masks (at least recently) likely lead many, many deaths.

The US uniquely ill-prepared pandemic. Everything rates obesity unique strain rebellion rejection expertise set us mass casualties.  Interview Norah Odonell true.

It‚Äôs almost absolutely zero clue infectious diseases work. Two questions whole thing. US hit 100K day end month? really hope not. think US would hit 70K last week.

Welcome exponential growth. always, conversation exculusively America hating leftists Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says ""there shutdown coming"" coronavirus cases wins irony! Right, exactly.

The article linked struck sort ambiguous. Maybe find source. Blue lives matter COVID WTF. Deja Vu here. that‚Äôs fucked man Anyone know yesterdays number updated? said worldometer 71.7k yesterday says hit 72k yesterday. (exposing nose mask) colorfully referred Dick Mask actually went Target Hawaii two hours ago.

I saw two women pulling masks laughing it...until security hit corner.

This guy look like mall security guard...he looked like night club bouncer.

He basically told put masks back gtfo.

They pleded heading out, notice still unpaid merchandise.

In short, put masks back escorted either check line took stuff kicked out.

This happened span 30 seconds. round us FEMA re-education camps. since incompetent, re-education cover properly wear masks. people engineering make 6 figures. Even bright ones.

Edit: changed 6 hope spread nonsense students look instagram stories you‚Äôd think virus eradicated. Honestly it‚Äôs like seen death toll case numbers Oh, covid come old white conservatives. Many old older white people aversion cleaning homes, managing pools, laundry, mowing lawns. There‚Äôs also really good chance grandkids watched nanny parents. 

No one country lives island away humans. We‚Äôre connected. well heeled hire people care them, sooner later help going exposed covid. 

Right covid common grocery store workers healthcare workers they‚Äôve working whole time. eventually virus spread office workers, people higher up, get past gates mansions.

I‚Äôll send good thoughts way, friend. I'm tears. can't believe Governor's idiocy. member! Ooh! 'member Russian bounties? 'member disinfectant injections? 'member! actually wasn‚Äôt silent.

There‚Äôs also difference protests, places vast majority people wore masks... people going business, masks social distancing indoors. sending children school- children, way, pretty much best possible vector spreading germs. 

The protests didn‚Äôt help, even good cause. There‚Äôs denying facilitate spread, mostly areas without mask orders. people decided protests worth risk, better worse, depending ask.

But doesn‚Äôt change fact virus serious problem, people like trying find anything fling pretend fake big deal. It‚Äôs fucking sad. know best time change is? It‚Äôs fucking now. Doesn‚Äôt matter protesting it‚Äôs for, what‚Äôs done done. Can‚Äôt change past, can‚Äôt change current reality right now, rather pointing fingers past nothing mitigate damage... stop fucking finding excuses start taking seriously now. This! 
Also nobody ever claimed masks protect covid19. protects others spreading droplets around infecting them. Wearing mask isn‚Äôt you, it‚Äôs everyone around you. First, explain ‚Äúpropagating‚Äù is.

So imagine people 

Will either get evicted home go foreclosure; 

Have credit card issuer demand money offer assistance more; 

Have power, gas, cable internet shut off; 

Have car repossessed; 

Have car, renters, life insurance policies canceled; 

And them, get hounded student loan debt collectors day night. 

Yeah, it‚Äôs going get ugly there. 

Have two ex roommates looking since March can‚Äôt even get target Starbucks hire them, many unemployed people.

If schools provided enough support funding may able open safely, schools rather half assed attempt security theatre completely collapse three six weeks new school year. took schools Israel two weeks collapse, Israel actually virus control.

Amazing works. Let's trumpets always interpret words. say misleading, say wrong lying. Ok, let's analyse!

The masks would silly / effective. masks referring n95 specifically effective means notably effective ordinary paper cloth mask us now. also referencing fact pandemic would play worse hospitals can't get hands needed equipment. 

There, completely reasonable need apology.  Science nothing trust. alone, good questions. remember everyone point moral/emotional journey. People need guidance others freedom make mistakes order grow, nobody teens early 20s dealing much uncertainty pressure time.

White House think controlling data hospitalizations stop? Bear mind I'm far advocating withholding medical treatment.

That said, I've heard hypothetical bandied lately makes interesting discussions. someone anti-masker, actively tries discourage others wearing masks, status anyone else age health beds come short hospital? possible know whether someone pro-mask anti-mask (it really short notice; thought experiment), would suppose doctors would justified showing preferential treatment pro-maskers them? case everyone's able get ventilator/bed, people invariably going go without. way tell people stood ""debate"" wearing masks, would think they'd morally ethically justified using data point deciding gets chance better medical care?

Personally, trust let bias overrule fairness here. vendetta anti-maskers, family member immune compromised, would literally die caught covid. reason, people refuse wear mask protect others disgust anger me. I'm glad I'm doctor, I'm worried able fair decisions like that, giving preferential treatment fair. :(  terrible.

Read article. shiva ayyadurai‚Äôs claim Fauci‚Äôs pocket big Pharma? get people see past gross accusations like that. Honest question, Fauci=GOAT humble motherfucker big ass dick. $600/week ""extra"" money. $600/wk additional unemployment payment equate someone's previous income plus $600/wk.

I know many people qualify maximum amount unemployment. I'm California, make least $48,000/year (or $4000/mo average past years) get max $450/week. best, additional $600 per week basically gets back someone makes $48,000/year.

The median incomes California $71,000 2018. median income earner California lost job, getting barely half living before. 

Besides, stop eating going outside? utility bills, rent/mortgage, etc. stop coming? Even staying home, people rent/mortgages, utilities, health insurance, car insurance, amenities (cell phone practically necessary days), home internet (also necessary), transportation costs, grocery/food. can't find median value, mean cost rent California $1381/mo. leaves $1000/mo groceries, health insurance (which, got laid pay COBRA get marketplace, expensive, like $300-400/mo up), car insurance, utilities, cell phone, internet, normal things I'm probably forgetting. Total up, $1000 go far. ignoring half population pays much median rent/mortgage loves higher cost living areas get penny unemployment benefits maxed.

TL;DR $600/week additional, unemployment I'm general, designed enough cover normal lives people unable work months. way whole thing handled citizens despicable. reason though never seen briefings, interviews regarding situation? simple googling can't find single occasion interviewed talked - neither now, pandemic. feels quite odd regarding prominent important role (although shadow Fauci White House) last months.

Maybe there's logical explanation it, still quite odd seen mentioned all. Bush plenty things good scientific disciplines, came real shit, didn‚Äôt fuck around. major flu outbreaks early 2000s. New forms chemical testing mail. Tbh probably cant see begin Give time. 35 crowd different set priorities even takes another decade two octogenarians power die, time come.

And propogate racism, hate, divisiveness, time coming. Tick tock. Tick tock. Lol blame white house...

Lumping pretty much anyone Limbaugh disrespectful super general way, even give reason.

You're basically arguing people matter Limbaugh got already meaningless.


Which many people gotten deserve it?

Tom Hanks absolutely deserved it. He's like walking record kind people giving to. Fox News needs drop ""news"" name call is, propaganda. Found Governor GA's reddit account here! US might actually survive thing. people smart enough Sweden lot better Belgium, UK, Italy. Sweden also lot better US. Compare Sweden NY state, example. 554 deaths/million vs 1672 death/million. 300% increase. top that, half US states count probable covid deaths. Southern states, Florida example, already exposed suppressing covid deaths infections. comparison joke. symptomatic asymptomatic, news report Chris Cuomo leading yesterday. actually talking patient using make point. theory deaths severe illnesses actually result re-infection, initial infection. Tying theory, believe sucker‚Äôs actually around while.

The reason think case, antibody load infection. people, especially asymptomatic, seem lower antibody load infection cleared. willing believe basis virus reinfecting, body hasn‚Äôt built enough immune response. Dr. Fauci President mean watched videos twitter China welding people apartment blocks. I‚Äôm doctor felt like pretty clear big problem January. Lmao really? That's sick numbers continue increase weeks even everyone started wearing masks today.

New York capped April 4ish, lockdown happened mid March. barely last weeks big number got fewer tests.

don't look now, arizona's percent positive coming down.

i doubt get 80k tomorrow. would need LOT things happen. like Georgia posting 5k.  need regulations ‚Äònews‚Äô Truth . Fauci fucking awesome may like it, several reasons.

- got spread wrong (too low), danger wrong (initially low, subcribed Imperial college's 1.2 million US deaths *with precautions taken* way high) 
- obvious got danger wrong, continued push restrictions. Even basic management says assumptions magnitude, revisit them
- indiscriminately pushing fear, focus risk people lost. lead spread deaths. Cuomo rightly gets blamed conservatives killing senior citizens forcing nursing homes take Covid positive people, Fauci, daily conferences time nothing. failure basic management - 80/20 rule followed.
- lied masks. reasons mentioning brought others lying time, reasons ignored time. Sure, get n95 masks restricted, difficult understand general face coverings discouraged height epidemic, mandatory now

The reason liked, people see bashing Trump, record pandemic terrible. 'Great! Let's send little rugrats school.' 

-Governor Ron DeathSentence Tulsa changed much since 1920 Guess toss textbooks, solved problem. need masks easy. I'm sure Trump get Medal Freedom day now. fuck texas burn, many idiots I‚Äôm amazed hasn‚Äôt vigilanty justice insurance CEOs decades ago. advocating violence I‚Äôm surprised one pushed beyond limit. Effective getting TV. Poor guy doesn‚Äôt know used push narrative. ""We biggest, beautiful virus. one virus. get calls time world leaders saying 'I've never seen virus like one there.' impressed, let tell you."" 71k day... long til herd immunity? I'll stay home away everyone waiting patiently. alone disgusting enough it‚Äôs lost ooze. need lot less partisan nonsense. According logic Democrats also control every country that‚Äôs shut economy control virus Never gonna happen. Sigh.....  would also decimate small businesses, already can't get employees nobody wants lose unemployment.

I'm one small town we've already lost half small businesses. Including like 3/4 mall...

Just saying there's going much left except big corporate.

If give everybody $2,000 month without unemployment qualifications straight get $2,000 month, country shut nobody go work avoid unless they're already working home.

People massively restructure lives figure live $2,000 month. It'll completely change economic infrastructure entire country.

Total systematic collapse.

Now get problem lots people die thing done. opinion point could saved things happening already passed.

It's beyond controllable there's easy way solve this.

You shut save lives totally wreck country, lots people die.

Neither decision ideal. 

You two options drink piss left eat shit right. point I'm gonna fake death, use remaining assets buy new ID papers move Montana (DMV Alexa Voice) serving salad tosser A-69 'rona sentient entity would laughing us. feel point, Newsom waiting Federal Gov get ass something.

We know problem children too. Yep, way old. Damn. spent whole segment last night ""covering"" study 2015 demonstrated masks safe. idea legit, could tell really banking hard one fucking study 5 years ago prove point gets people killed think anyone finds actually funny.

It's fucking travesty low point country. sometimes, gotta use little dark humor and/or satire, reality otherwise makes want cry. know said that? That's reasonable point. Seriously, everything I‚Äôve learned him, dude fucking legend. Unless he‚Äôs hiding dark secret, seems like goddamn saint Trump glad him.

Well, Idiot Idiot thinks right... Lunacy. Maybe delayed speed mask use adopted beginning... using March statement excuse today‚Äôs (lack of) mask implementation? .... nah. That‚Äôs weak cop-out. 

Until message comes top via clear concise order government leaders (federal, state, local; regardless political parties) hold outs still always hold out. Particularly hold outs diehard political cultists lack critical thinking self-responsible public health without hand held. 

The top-down message right wealth health facade ‚Äúliberties rights‚Äù, that‚Äôs mask holdouts blindly follow personally get hit harder heath wealth. home making usually would make. Lmao rather situation possible. thinking need UV detoxes bleach injections. work Target tell pretty much 100% certainty nothing. I'm San Diego city state mandate wear masks public now. managers straight say allowed enforce it. Today work talked said allowed enforce it. solution right government extend unemployment benefits. continue giving people making. They're creating weird situation people fight tooth nail go back work they'll making less sit around day.

You put savings I'd willing bet every person like 20 saving. weird stimulus designed spent like foresight doing.

Anyway, that's government's problem deal with. means we'll paying back even entitled benefits it. 150 updoots gets pulled incivility ü§£ Florida + Texas + South Carolina set brand new deaths records day. I'm sure coincidence sign deaths ticking *exactly experts predicted would.* effective? world renowned infectious disease specialist proven it. bunch yahoo's support ""ma freedom"" anti-vaxx change that. idiots. scourge upon earth. better virus humanity fighting. Living things dangerous need eradication. Yes, 165-170 degrees 30 minutes. basically putting together filters cloth masks....I can't sew worth damn.

You can't wash H600, 3 layers, melt-spun-melt. spun layer microscope looks like spaghetti. fibers electrostatic charge pulls particle holds like cat hair black sweater. Getting wet negates charge reduces filtration capacity.  touche So, circling back topic hand, he's *not* category Fauci, put Trump, reasonable people know really count. Dedicating entire professional life elevating public health.

Man's hero book.

Rock Fauci. 

## Abstract

**Objective:** Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fatal fast-spreading viral infection. date, number COVID-19 patients worldwide crossed six million three hundred seventy thousand deaths (according data World Health Organization; updated 2 June 2020). Although COVID-19 rapidly diagnosed, efficient clinical treatment COVID-19 remains unavailable, resulting high fatality. clinical trials identified vitamin C (VC) potent compound pneumonia management. addition, glycyrrhizic acid (GA) clinically anti-inflammatory medicine pneumonia-induced inflammatory stress. hypothesized combination VC GA potential option treating COVID-19.

**Methods:** aim study determine pharmacological targets molecular mechanisms VC + GA treatment COVID-19, using bioinformational network pharmacology.

**Results:** uncovered optimal targets, biological processes Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes Genomes (KEGG) pathways VC + GA COVID-19. findings suggested combinatorial VC GA treatment COVID-19 associated elevation immunity suppression inflammatory stress, including activation cell receptor signaling pathway, regulation Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, ErbB signaling pathway vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway. also identified 17 core targets VC + GA, suggest antimicrobial function.

**Conclusions:** first time, study uncovered pharmacological mechanism underlying combined VC GA treatment COVID-19. results benefit efforts address pressing problem currently facing world. criminal happening it? reporting positive tests (ie. 10 000 tests done 2000 positive reported 2000 number). impact total number positive cases. waste time, pretty incredible level blindness takes think protests didnt help spread virus. US started seeing massive increases protests started late May seems like people want put everything except protests. saying main cause cmon people... saying anything guy, typically big red flag people working close industry ghost writer problem science. (I idea tbh) cheat again? Russian interference, electoral college mechanism? said January US nothing worry about. article Fauci, Trump didn't. saw ""sweden"" looked way. I'm prepared cancelled think Sweden right approach. never actually went lockdown yeah numbers bad approached allowed obtain herd immunity death count 0 days cases dropping significantly. Trump giving stuff away ""hoax"" anyway?

Now SELLING maybe could admire low cunning getting dumbassses pay good money snake oil, guess.... /s People like keep reddit readable people like me. Thank you. gonna games including football games vaccine comes out. Hey guys, sorry hop top comment 

I created petition stop suppression Covid-19 data reinstate CDC primary handler said information. Please share send PMs improve petition.

http://chng.it/Wkz2tQ8C Zoomer here, genuinely loop ‚Äî Tom Hanks philanthropist?  No? People need wear masks. thought time decided extra time message something completely ridiculous? Nice. you‚Äôd read messages you‚Äôd see definitely think people need masks. use correctly work. use wrong may well bother. you‚Äôre around people sick sick need mask. Since can‚Äôt tell sick people aren‚Äôt able tell themselves, masks needed... wear mask literally everywhere go (as since day one thing) chill reddit harass people 100+ days ago. FYI I‚Äôm blocking you. guess respond you‚Äôll talking well. fellow 30 year old, think people 30's still MUCH ahead us. families young start them, much career, traveling, life experiences left do. think boomer parents reckless they've really done much life. However, feel fair us they're idiots. could hurt us going getting sick, contributes situation unsafe generation reasonable responsible. Idk explain it, picture big Obama vibes.  hospitals full medical personnel die late everyone else COVID related not. already tried that. People care. gonna try again, economy fucked.  guy thinks cant catch corona support BLM? Idk seem pretty ball science wise comes joint space operations such. Plus like US better recently science wise. president believes windmills cause cancer talk sh*t? I've heard runs streaks. Look face tell don‚Äôt think looks retarded. Cause dumbass. Please refer [this link archived copy hit paywall.

Illinois Governor tells like like wished was. Ellen Everywhere matters. Vote wherever are. always helps, morally, practically sown ballot stuff. rate, one American trying cross Canadian border non-essential reasons bad. feel defeated. anyone please explain Fauci said ‚Äúpeople shouldn‚Äôt walking around masks?‚Äù

I‚Äôve heard excuse wanted save masks medical professionals... killed many peoples opinion him.

It also contributed people refusing wear masks claiming guess did. Fuck it‚Äôs bad. half age hope look half good twice age current age. would think people go last people want line 30 minutes. Mitch McConnel cunt that's why. Chuck Huber spring chicken. He's certainly risk. propaganda. Yeah real hero. I'll make sure tell teacher wife got students back next strike comes. laugh. People like dime dozen make sick. Go complain taxes more, hearing horseshit last 30 years. USA No.1 !!  saying Americans consideration health others. coincidence obesity also chart there. Personal responsibility health poor. Lol 

It rough school ended. problems teaching things people kids teaching actual school stuff instead replace clutch certainly challenges. week good. top school work he's also learning wrench vehicles, also use chop saw/drill build things wood. 

Cant wait drag welder new research? masks prevent people spreading germs?  stop. article didn‚Äôt specifically say age.  cases nearly 330K tests fyi context.

Daily TPR hovering around 10% India 2.5% peak National Lockdown 2-3 months ago.

Overall Average TPR Tests conducted far ~7.7% now. ""due"" modesty make sense got food Kroger today mostly parents older folks wearing masks. I'm American friend supporting 2016 election. talking recently said never would made mistake 2016. okay. yup too. bugged supplies wasn't, saying regular people wearing masks, touch face more. Ah, Chinese government special. Please Fauci, don‚Äôt hurt em. Bolingbrook Understood article Fauci, Trump expecting comments, thank you. even close. like 35k time... Wear mask wash hands? article Fauci, Trump  Cheers, ninety ninth precinct mean said masks weren‚Äôt effective March ? Yes no. 
It‚Äôs almost certain without quarantine spread would much faster deadlier. Bud wasn‚Äôt pretending mine, said copied lmao. Glad stayed topic. please stop ""winning"" already; please? know well-functioning government moderately competent technocrat immediately spawns cult personality Exactly. worse Haters polarized lol Oh...I understand now. think shows minimum wage needs greatly increased, UBI become thing. read one report poor lady, fairly well-known one can‚Äôt remember name, infected symptomatic three months. can‚Äôt even imagine feel bad her! Whatever Trump supposed doing, utterly failed president. Damn effective decades literally protests month ago lmao thank you, fifth generation reptilia can't believe number people think going die.

If right they're wrong, feel feel revisit subreddit year give em good teasing

If wrong they're right, they're gonna busy trying live wrack huge hospital bill difference usually reporting site handles backlog cases. example, 5,500+ cases Bexar county, Texas today, insanely high. total number though, 691 officially today. rest cases delays reporting previous days. 

Worldinfometers noted counted 691 daily total Bexar county today. rest backlog cases, evenly distributed cases case counts, using historical averages county determine much redistribute. 

When look 7 day averages, sites fairly line. (Some count probable cases, others don't). think that's important. That's government. That's government chosen people there. democracy, makes government.

typo edit No, means Bene Gesserit ingesting much spice turning next Kwisatz Haderach. things hopeful including Resmedivir, plasma treatment improved ICU protocols.. states counting probable Covid deaths patient dies prior tested Covid. data excess annual deaths causes (diabetes, hypertension leading stroke heart attack, pneumonia, blood clots) **will recorded.** fall outside median range annual deaths diseases, know Covid deaths undercounted. okay people die chronic manageable conditions pandemic properly managed. 100,000s thousands deaths people could live decades acceptable. ""I think he's cool dude"" - Dr. Anthony Fauci god bro didnt even take edits. I'm going consider copypasta way I'm going hear opinion actually give substantial response. can‚Äôt beat fresh tortillas. bucket list item Canadians news does. love it. Check CBC coverage Covid I'm sure infer ""there's reason regular people wearing masks"". mention surgical masks cloth masks ok. original message pretty clear, regular people wearing masks, wearing masks worse since touch face more. Data support claim? great parent! Keep badass! One scientist lifetims experience field. real estate. Trump obviously didn‚Äôt lead well...but think reasonable people looking Fauci unfortunately blew little early on. dead I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm saying people making usually make bonus. Stay strong Fuck it, I'll actually wasn‚Äôt silent.

Yeah, was. balls job call people spreading pandemic ya know, also difference protests, places vast majority people wore masks... people going business, masks social distancing indoors. sending children school- children, way, pretty much best possible vector spreading germs.

Wrong many counts. [As see tons protestors wear masks. ""Most masks"" mean shit, especially CDC keep 6 feet others. cloth face cover substitute social distancing.

[The **not** protect COVID-19. 

Most people everywhere else *DID* wear masks, ultimately able follow social distancing protocols. Protestors street *thousands* packed together shoulder shoulder like sardines. far worst offenders violating safety doesn‚Äôt change fact virus serious problem, people like trying find anything fling pretend fake big deal.

Not sure fuck about? know best time change is? It‚Äôs fucking now. Doesn‚Äôt matter protesting it‚Äôs for, what‚Äôs done done. Can‚Äôt change past, can‚Äôt change current reality right now, rather pointing fingers past nothing mitigate damage... stop fucking finding excuses start taking seriously now.

The past **DOES** matter people broke safety protocol forced us situation we're right now. protests STILL going on, ignoring social distancing, swarms people yelling screaming spewing aerosols eachother going back hometowns spread disease more.

I think u/iMnotHiigh taking seriously, one's treat like political party people like somehow manage convince protestors either spread virus justify agree cause. while, 150,000 americans DEAD.


Most people taking seriously trying earn living live lives. Instead assholes sides spectrum-anti maskers protestors-blatantly disregarding everybody else's health safety.

He right call Fauci ignoring 400lb gorilla room. protestors need called major role spreading pandemic, assholes like want cover stick head sand people dying. Disgusting. CA LOT republicans. county might OK. It‚Äôs close call ‚ÄúHedgecock first tested positive coronavirus April 20. May 9, tested negative, said.

Nearly two weeks later, took oral nasal swab test. oral test came back negative, nasal came back positive.‚Äù

Sounds it‚Äôs she‚Äôs clearing damn thing rather reinfected. yeah that‚Äôs still concerning she‚Äôs hung long that‚Äôs unheard You‚Äôre wrong young people. see lot bare faced boomers masked millennials Tennessee yeah im fasting water couple days theory creates lot questions would answer.

1. sudden surge repeat infections Wuhan?

2. would able reconstruct sequences descended first identified Hubei virus already circulating place?

3. countries implemented test trace early known portion pandemic successful? South Korea Taiwan never locked down, successfully controlled virus contact tracing border control. virus already swept China twice well enough connected would find testing tracing isn‚Äôt viable since substantial community spread already.

There multitude reasons different people could see different outcomes studies identified risk factors like age, male sex, type blood, diabetes, obesity, smoking, etc. likely account differences outcomes. Keep mind factors vary greatly depending population looking at. EU, instance, much older population much world median age 43 compared 30 thinking young healthy people died, know could either factor haven‚Äôt identified yet, genetic susceptibility, it‚Äôs one times medicine can‚Äôt guarantee anything. instance know woman died 30s lung cancer despite never smoked anything life around anyone does. Crap happens people doctors can‚Äôt always figure why.  person awarded twice?  gas stations would best thing facebook news getting personalised them, micro targeted much insiduous. Donald Rumsfeld stated would thanking road starting wars, Realpolitik action. Strangely can't find within thank them. Nah, impossible. y'all remember? beat thing back Easter. miracle.

/s... incase.  Desantis' whole MO ""what require least amount short term effort me.""

He give shit either way, want *do* anything.  could also people dying home, uncounted victims virus tested hospital dying. Time tell.

It's negative... luxury complacent feel good things we'd like virus control. agree right? DeSantis got go next election. 

What incompetent joke. Dr Fauci: FACE! Mofo‚Äôs Maybe need find job GE? It‚Äôs truly horrifying imagine 4 years believe said weren‚Äôt enough masks medical workers, Fauci wanted masks hands general public masks could made hoax realz you‚Äôall Yeah. former soft core porn model gave State Union.

Imagine saying 4 years ago. tell Nothing response US proactive, start now?  awesome. Reminds Obama took opportunity state union honor acknowledge Michael Moore documentaries... remember GOP losing minds it. I've heard baaad rumours them. I‚Äôll get downvoted. 

I one them. 

I won‚Äôt again.

I‚Äôm ashamed myself. understand voted him. I‚Äôm way different then.

I‚Äôve got fan Fauci shirt prove it.

Edit: Fauci Yes  one held accountable. Ever. saying also amazes people can't figure guys think food shortages fall second wave? started conjecturing back March. Oddly, males affected. Yeah well stupid shit. lots others either. punished. punishes shut properly. Look Massachusetts example. close again? really should. Set similar paperwork ready Covid tests. Quick explanation vaccine side effects, quick wipe alcohol wipe, needle, signature, drive off. read r/covid_positive believe long haulers still positive tests. month seem long enough reinfection though. that‚Äôs what‚Äôs reported. barista sue half it. like ember landing lawn fanning it, complaining ember set house fire. NYC 8 million people, people state, densely packed yet kept control. We‚Äôd infected took handful people start it. It‚Äôs us blame states reopened suffered results exponential growth. Blame local governments taking seriously. Even NY visitors never showed up, matter time. ‚ÄúSlate making essential coronavirus coverage free readers. Subscribe support journalism. Start free trial.‚Äù nyt, washington post, etc would thing That's false. study South Africa found HIV patients higher mortality compared general population (I think factor 2 greater). Yep, effective getting people wear masks March. muscular singe digit body fat high BMI

LOL, take steroids, hit gym religiously last 5+ years may perfectly applicable. Actually, religiously, church usually per week whereas hit gym 3x 4x per week. 'overwieght' single-digit bodyfat, look like professional male model athlete. 99% people look like that.

So saying ""BMI doesnt mean anything"" saying something useless applies *only* 99% population. tell 1% apart looking them, really easy do. BMI great tool, easily identify tiny portion people apply to.

The people claim BMI mean anything ones like number gives them. fault them, BMI. Exactly. It‚Äôs going since March. watched real time Brooklyn. hell people back then?? internet?? I‚Äôm confused people talking this. feeling part string ""single day highs"" dad, dad, call dad genuinely reaction first (nerves already edge going world), least good sense take Xanax fucking get it. Legitimate question: receiving extra $600 week knowing benefit would end sooner rather later, money? Expenses minimal since theory spending due shutdown. would hope saved, although huge increase consumer sales past month promising sign. would ok that, could teach whoever maintain work did. think im mire upset next person able keep up. have! hospital worker watching news past 6 months? China, Italy, New York? yeah got friend whose father's neighbours pet dog frequently visited house neighbour street's kid's school teacher's relative's uncle also got result.

very convenient ? Shut up. adults talking. Can‚Äôt blow nose it? turning American Wuhan Thank expressing feel wonder organ damage. Lung heart damage occur even asymptomatics otherwise ‚Äúmild‚Äù cases. Boris Johnson comes mind guy wouldn‚Äôt shock learn CT scan revealed lung heart damage. know Fauci's fault, hard care Presidential medal freedom since Rush-tainted. love ""Just deal it"" photo. It‚Äôs unconstitutional stop movement states. clause thing.


I thought might illegal well it‚Äôs not.

The federal government derives authority isolation quarantine Commerce Clause U.S. Constitution.

Under section 361 Public Health Service Act (42 U.S. Code ¬ß 264), U.S. Secretary Health Human Services authorized take measures prevent entry spread communicable diseases foreign countries United States states.

As far man power location would make easier states. agree would difficult impossible.

Hopefully things get better. See, maybe that's problem. supposed wear ass. confusing understand despite litigious justice system world, US going assign liability companies cause COVID infections. Got awarded one Trump last State Union constantly licking asshole :/ lot people. Live single wide trailer sticks $1200 left rent utilities. One day, it‚Äôs like miracle, disappear.

That day happens day White House takes control distributing numbers! president made pandemic political.... Maybe go past 99999 rolls back 00000 report numbers like states do. Read GA DPH site, pretty pathetic. still controversy repeatable scientific fact. 

Every time see fauci see. appreciate even lies like that, praise goes far. Ok, perfectly safe vaccine 100% effective comes sept

Tell honestly think January healthy adults kids gonna injected vaccine country? republicans party. They‚Äôve absolutely lost minds. Guess gave lol wow. ‚ÄúBiden Obama stopped testing,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúThey stopped it. probably know that. I‚Äôm sure don‚Äôt want report it. stopped testing. Right middle, went, ‚ÄòNo testing.‚Äô‚Äù Yes has. 7day average deaths 500s start month. 700s ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty effective‚Äù - Every ineffective person ever think right begin with. bad read post red forman's voice?  Yeah Trump gave one long ago  Um, fucking old people too! easy reply ""I'm sorry hear that. Since can't wear mask, think safe shop here. offer delivery app, etc etc."" Full bob haircut karen lots Disneys running around Cal. hope wearing masks! Regarding vaccines, know long immunity lasts. like infection, perhaps 2 3 months. hope I'm wrong. That's opinion, happen. white people die hands police every year, doesnt ""happen""? fact almost double amount white people die hands police every year compared black people. narcissistic president everything power admit fucked up, happens, narcissist throw everyone bus get caught lies prove lying. see currently butfuckery opening schools. 

source: mother narcissist, pulled bullshit over. America turned one big monster truck rally. rofl going get uglier Things going change quickly there's outbreak kid's classroom. One thing say is, ""Oh Jason covid, that's exciting."" flip fuck happens. school send kids get tested, stop there. ""Oh Mrs. King's first grade class got sent sent home quarantine? expect send 8 year old daughter school? crazy??!??"" get point ""death surge"" real, instantly understood phrase? Oooh corporate drama. US I'm pretty sure allow airlines receive stupendous subsidies, rewrite labor contracts regulations regarding staffing cut costs, lay people rehire less money, go back turning pretty healthy profit late 2021 needs man tell bully Trump GET LOST face, MANO MANO - dont let bully Trump take little Fauci!! Something maybe explains this, 20-29 year olds arent less responsible, going back work economies reopen. Higher proportions age range work high risk jobs retail food service, closed lockdowns.

According statistics collected CDC, demographic lowest mask usage 40-49 age 74.9%

30-39: 84.4%

40-49: 68%

50-64: 79.2%

&amp;#x200B;

Blaming ""young"" people seeing statistical uptick silly. 30-39 age range highest mask usage adherence, 18-29 par 50-64 year olds.

&amp;#x200B;

I live red county washington, I'm VAST majority people wearing masks older men women, \~50+ years old. mask mandate helped lot, still stubborn dickheads there. One old man post office even berated USPS worker wearing mask, raising voice saying ""That mask unhealthy you, done tests show lowers oxygen levels. need tell manager wont wear it!"" - entirely unprompted responded employee, woman early 30's. said nothing handed package. guy would like Yes has. death rate rising every day. 1000 deaths today. couple weeks ago like 300 day. idea 1000 bigger 300 make sense tiny brain?

Additionally, fuck think gonna happen two three weeks? 77k motherfuckers today gonna recover fully? God damn man read fucking book.

And also we‚Äôre still first wave dumbass Total taxes collected U.S. per year: little 3 trillion. 210 million x 2000 dollars x 12 months: 5 trillion. Yeah, let's take taxes pay. Rush presidential medal? go page:    

Scroll graph beneath ""Daily New Deaths US""  

See lines shorter two weeks ago longer last week well week? That's beginning another lap Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. That's burns most.

Smart people. I'm talking math, finance, etc. ....but believe whacky ""out there"" stuff.

How intelligent believe nonsense? r/hedidthemonstermath never met white boy Georgia? hate every black person ever always. Atlanta cleared (insert racist epithets ever heard) good saved rope. actively work kill many non whites raciast. LOVE guy! And, yes, Dr. Fauci, pretty effective. fuck that, rush limbaugh getting cancer funny. foods spoil several months particularly good you. least kind people stock (junk foods). retailers realized onslaught anti-maskers headed way planned accordingly. Also hurt Kroger Walmart made announcements. Oh, know still suffering. shame, really feel people situation. Nope link Examiner one else wrote direct quote Fauci. That‚Äôs exactly power get ignore facts. modern country many people ‚Äúdo believe in‚Äù scientific findings. anti-science make free thinker... makes unintelligent. Americans dumb reality fine rush get vaccine already proved safe. passed safety trials. bestest numbers! Better China! Negative cases making economy strongest!  Fauci 67 cases one golf course?? live BC, population 5 million people, throughout whole pandemic we've days many new cases whole province... someone else mentioned, also thought masks weren‚Äôt necessary without COVID first research came saying otherwise lit joint? actually done pandemic, though? Asking seriously, looking serious answers. lol saw CNN's China based reporter journalist partying China's tropical island last month counterparts TIME Sky News Karen doubling Karenhood. It‚Äôs boomers refusing wear masks  Ah, sorry, get it! Fake news lets forget mask-free ""relaxation zones,"" indoors üôÑ  fuck? checked Twitter hour ago assumed 73,000 end-of-day number. depressing.  cannot possible try spin way continue lock downs Gap year elementary school. Found touch rich kid. Boy. screwed up. another post doesnt help found posted it: 

That article posted written Dennis Rancourt, knows Jack shit. ""tons conflicting scientific reports"" says masks work? normally post things actually read? wonder spreading misinformation. 

The person confused you. community low case load spread low risk kids

Very kids get sick dumb argument ""welfare queens"" bullshit recycled. won‚Äôt lie, confused deaths remain low.

‚ÄúLow‚Äù.... still. Relative total infections... people can't handle it. municipal building today dropping primary ballot old Karen walks starts bitching masks, can't live like this...etc. trying walk back car kept talking like going validate stupid rambling. remember reading article earlier week can't find reddit. sure link Would shop supermarket every 300th customer gets killed? Paying people money fed makes everyone poorer. Tell makes feel better. enjoy hell life. think Europe opened schools foolishly Plandemic video making rounds social media sure help. get it‚Äôs joke cancer isn‚Äôt funny. 

I‚Äôd rather live, constantly stub toes every 5 minutes rest life. Target masks since late february/early march Massachusetts live Dollar General required would help ton. sign door letting unnamed people help. ever played civ4? thats basic strategy man could still go roast duck tho feels like years ago :/ lied. Let's clear it. idea ""no politics, bullshit"" flat wrong. Wow surprising solve it.  Kids already car seat, makes sense think balance. things, including video games, creative activities.

I'm parent, can't say best implement kind balance, especially world overwhelmed technology.

My brother's kid Waldorf school essentially banned consuming kind media home. work either inevitably exposed (YouTube, Minecraft) became super addicted tear away it.

On end spectrum, letting kid watch Twitch Youtube day young age can't good.

Maybe typical nowadays, really spend time internet teenager. kid read fuck ton books. grew without TV, play video games occasionally, spent lot time playing outside. able get schoolwork done little involvement parents. idiot. pushing us toward herd immunity, truly way forward. Well 73k according Worldometers.

Holy shit. Based played them, would get stuck bill. Pass. work labor trade entire factory mandatory masks outside eating work areas proper distance others. smaller privately owned factory though  places COL low nothing going besides cheap. pay 1K/mo crappy studio apartment building full transients. That's steal New Jersey. people make profit collecting UBI boonies, good them. grew town like that. jobs besides Dollar Tree everyone addicted opiates. Hard pass really is! earth would listen Fauci. makes zero sense! whole reason hes position hes in, help times like this. feels like we're strange alternate dimension. I'm well aware explanation, bottom line knowingly told lie. said masks necessary knew were. do. wanted bit rare fun.

He sees news what's driving polls. I'll agree cares both. believe thinks news, twitter commentary news, drive polls exclusively.

We're right? US tested whole population Canada plus 6 million more. Canada tested 3.3 million people, order magnitude less. know, know, per capita shit, point, logistics shitting materials hundreds millions people starts bottleneck. supply chain isnt set that. empathy exactly thing realize merely surviving still horrible will/could negatively affect people rest lives? That's acceptable you? God hate that. gosh, course pandemic would happen big, overcrowded, dirty city like NYC beautiful state Texas? \*shocked pikachu face\* county live 28 confirmed cases deaths. TX AZ hell bent changing that. many died pneumonia? also need dead good thing US fuckton hospitals, systems place efficiently transfer patients them. States Hospital systems set protocols move overflow patients there‚Äôs room.

So individual hospitals hitting capacity, we‚Äôre still ways away outright denying ICU care need it. Abbott, dug pit here. dude, think healthy people susceptible negative affects covid gonna get vaccinated, parents gonna someone inject possibly rushed vaccine kids kids susceptible covid, got news you... gonna rush get vaccine gonna wait months see happens?

That first thing wrote response saying wait January. strawman, actual question. reality covid going long time, four months. polio vaccine made 50s. Polio eradicated 70s state matters? not, hopefully soothe conscience Haha thanks üòÑ I'll keep one day go beach over. Hope stay safe too!  Mitch, Rand, anything? actually help constituents instead blocking billed confirming judges? Wait see bill. shit outdated, know now. Steven Reed Montgomery, Alabama, describes executive order mask requirement mitigation measures constrained spread coronavirus city even state's numbers grew control. think everyone seen happened Wuhan, Italy NY. going every different seeing eyes, matter much prepared mentally I'm pretty sure dog would done better job also going regret medical bill  republicans board first one already agreed 2nd form. makes sense shutdown certain businesses stop spread highly contagious deadly virus.  Frozen 3: Grandparents think already could tell cunt He's busy mmmmmmm blockin' haters one group denying science driven simple steps take bring pandemic control. disagree assessment people enjoying watching numbers rise. know, things bad first time around trying hide lot leaked videos evidence. seeing anything time around suggests things bad again?

Obviously can't trust word, surely SOMETHING would bubbled channels ongoing disaster. probably trying get handsome customer behind vault. know young people days. Always think sex ü§ßü§§. Unless impacts personally Buffalonian here. weird place this, especially pop head Downstate grew up. got looks wearing mask OUTSIDE. Knowing we‚Äôre still waaaay better places feels incredibly sad. drove PA hour Memorial Day made face people basically humping line ice cream. yes, masks. need ask? Teachers get fired lot pre tenure get shuffled around quit post tenure. closed bars. finally time build wall make Americans pay Total crosses 1 million I've felt way years said, yes recent months really pushed edge. would genuinely love pursue getting family hell country eventually. Yeah, office planning open August, pushed back big wave. Seems ridiculous even making plans though. Work home fine. Like risk still seem worth it. 6 weeks. shut *everything* 6 weeks. groceries either delivered online pickup. Minimal contact. Everyone receives $6,000.

No virus.

But no. Trump even wear mask couple days ago. Hey, might want get cough checked out. hear something's going around. too, friend. too. real... think called cancerous, wished cancer upon him. least think LOL agree words hard one ever said UBI caused economic collapse. *would* cause economic collapse shutting economy. dead bring piled truck liberals, would probably cheer deaths, they‚Äôre disgusting trash. Oh whatever. Comments advocate refusing medical treatment people based political beliefs regularly get hundreds upvotes.

I would never advocate refusing medical treatment anyone. mean can't root cancer.  better give husband one too. 
Hey-o! ü§™ Nah, step Lego every minute rest days. article linked

'It concluded evidence votes changed actual voting machines, ‚ÄúRussian¬†cyberactors position delete change voter data‚Äù'¬†


The Russians hack election way media says did. looked votes, change them. would call looking election results early ""hacking election"".

You technically right, media paint like this.  People ask me, *""Tom, success achieved, hard staying humble?""*

I tell them, *""Not me. I'm pretty amazing humble.""*  God damn it. Hippocratic oath all, sure. docs refused treat patients states lockdown mask requirements. Biden walked back female VP picked Fauci, would applaud. ain‚Äôt worried chopping 200b budget... we‚Äôd still close double Sad fall back personal insults.

Perhaps assholes like could make masks. title. don‚Äôt think so? Maybe. Sometimes words hard.  point Wuhan USA China UBI leads economic collapse? People pay rent, bills, buy stuff need money. hoard buy nice vacation year now. likely thing households get spent immediately put back economy. 

If money hands consumers consumer economy leads collapse nothing going keep afloat. interesting refuse answer anything I've asked. obviously realize people free country able walk Dr's office approved vaccine injected system.  hate timeline  [fauci: haters gonna hate... hate... Maybe shouldn‚Äôt shut economy ? Gotta wear eye masks block hate Hold on, seriously arguing saving someone's life worth it, feel insulted by.... idea spit? 

What's next, going refusing use toilet paper, offends acknowledge shit stinks? mean Melania gave one. Based Republicans board 2nd round stimulus greater restrictions. Nobody board shutting country handing large sums money that'd dumb fuck. Trump fucked basically opposite Democrats want every turn. advocate mask use ASAP. really influenced South give shit Covid. California mess reasons I‚Äôm guessing test kids suspected close contact covid19 positive person. Im surprised percentage higher misleading title Yeah, still diminished exercise capacity, fatigue, brain fog, and, reason, post recovery depression. sad watch. He's clearly 100%. Lmao picture next level ""Masks work"" asshole like could disrupt supply chain health workers buy N95 masks yourselves? president ill prepared pandemic sends substantial amount PPE China hadn‚Äôt spent first three years bulking stocks PPE H1N1 pandemic, choice. He's writing book Trump President anymore let loose. question ""if get vaccine"". Treatment options hopefully help mortality rate, eradicating virus. pretty much vaccine nothing want wipe out. reduced ""critical community size"". viruses without animal reservior, easily identifiable. human history 2 total instances viral eradication. Smallpox rinderpest.

The others, basically ended still around. say, treatments help. big plagues history black plague bacterium. treatable antibiotics. Viruses not. Well... factor. factor... factor. 830k tests today. ever day u stop bringing politics everything? I‚Äôm even sure point even more. We‚Äôve kept infection rate low forcing people quarantine certain states threat massive fines. parts state give people dirty looks wearing mask outside. Anyone trying sneak states make 50% US population quarantine, acts like business usual asshole. one goes apeshit wearing mask here, either. Meet Aug 15 thereabouts? want start saying field work claim opinions viable, I'm putting thoughts see others think. 

For theory make sense start assumption discover indeed reinfected virus based recent studies question.

My theory reason seeing varying levels illness recent studies proven sewage tests dating way back 2019 virus us longer initially thought. knowing people saying well pandemic start sooner? Perhaps happening assuming reinfection possible depending number times infected dictates ill based infection slowly damaging body. Say ppl first infection generally asymptomatic mildly ill, clears confusion ppl get sick don't. reach third even possibly four time infected people ending hospital serious complications due prior damage last boughts fighting off. 

Again expert way claiming facts theory true would fill lot blanks including different countries seeing varying degrees illness death. Places like Italy others Europe perhaps tourists hot spots already population go first second infections ppl third fourth hence seeing hospitalization death.

Thank taking time read this, put thoughts hopes people knowledge viruses could explain theory even possible.

Frankly large *minority* suffices. problem regional problem, gerrymandered too. one town one comfortable group wearing masks. another next door, person entire block wearing mask. 

The lack national leaderpship incredibly important well, grassroots effort definitely matter gaining critical mass. Kinda like herd immunity :/ Yur mum Exploiting inept national leadership... photoshoot mask Later, dork Except proved face masks work people wore pandemic would sooner. didn't, paid everyone $1200 last end pandemic.

Also say anything eradication lol know related, Navicent CEO [announced today too. Mans watching US fail managing coronavirus people didn‚Äôt listen him.

Stealing ladies indefinitely, look china new zealand.. keep like ( without lockdown/ mask/ socail distancing) we‚Äôll see lot death perfect season plan diets skip restaurants. plan follow plan, lose weight even try (just ignore brief snacking throughout day).

AZ reporting even fewer tests last week though. think like 12000-ish per day last week. r/Coronavirus AZ saw comment one smaller labs got pulled offline test results backlogged getting 30+ days late. know true is, would help explain fewer test results shown last days. last week Ducey promised new testing machine would online week. believe would happen quickly I'm sad say wrong. would like believe incorrect future number cases US whole, highly suspect right. know AZ get act together comes testing. part whole pandemic response fiasco.  test positive ""incubation period"" virus *yet* showing symptoms? Also, test positive asymptomatic?

Sorry sound like obvious questions Google useless answering right going say technically rhyme, DO!! 

thanx bud, matt learned something: also called ‚Äúimperfect **rhyme**,‚Äù ‚Äú**slant rhyme**,‚Äù ‚Äúnear **rhyme**,‚Äù ‚Äúoblique **rhyme**.‚Äù **can** defined **rhyme** stressed syllables ending consonants match, however preceding vowel sounds **do** match. instance, words ‚Äúshape‚Äù ‚Äúkeep‚Äù consonance strong. Remember, reported cases! state government actively fighting cities counties instituting mask orders. couple weeks later, state mask order. Canadian, Canada government , even were, ask US government speak?   Let's punish people good. Twitter pretty much social media network left balls stock market time highs

Not all-time highs, Dow least basically back year ago. spot line vent tube. Another quote add Fauci's pile nonsense 2020. also man could conceive virus-related lockdown US, even 3 weeks China forced so.

Whatever Fauci says, exact opposite usually true. least he's exhausted incorrect answers, occasionally stumbles right one.

**Q. would never happen here, would it? Locking 50 million people?**

**A (Fauci).** No, chance. would never I'm convinced he'd let Puerto Rican doctors  Hello OnlyFans. soup, plan get frozen vegetables need new fridge that. fall bad warn might bad idea stay doors months. due modesty... üï∂ think I'm pretty effective.  else caused then? taking hydroxycholroquine cereal every morning know, lift twice weight feel better ever. Well said. Bravo. I'm optimistic government would willing shoulder costs vaccinations. Yeah, US normally big free healthcare, thing shut economy. nothing else, they'll benefit big businesses. Nothing going change minds now. Bless heart. probably 3% 5% population either infected recovered; maybe maybe less. going herd immunity need atleast 50% immunity *if* still mitigations; 70+% otherwise. 

There very, long way go want strategy. Dow futures up. G-D help us. important, young people make workforce getting relief stay home. Sure, problem irresponsibility, that's certainly it. Take gloves Fauci, ya throw hands I'll back lol. I'm man! exactly problem? challenge point single instance CCP tampering scientific publications COVID made citizens. case death totals obviously fabricated, constraint imposed peer reviewed research can‚Äôt publish studies sample size larger total number cases report.

Applying fact case totals government reports untrustworthy perceived veracity peer reviewed research scientists publish makes look stupid. Meanwhile New Zealand, kinda speaks itself. Lucky Kiwi bastards. start addressing medical masks flooding market. 3 layers melt blown layer/non-woven fabric, what's efficacy vs surgical masks? talking something like BYD masks buy cheaply office depot Costco. Awesome, cant counter argue anymore. fuck off.  think word looking ‚Äúdemocide‚Äù. discovered human race generally selfish, cruel short sighted. like, massively, not. enough deserve attention empathy anymore.  true. people want tested, prefer hide authorities. Death cult. 

This guy trying make sure Americans die without actually shooting like dictators. Time ban travel Georgia, Florida Texas. Yep, lot Texans likely go outside fall winter find weather tolerable. Uhh, easily 1k several months... didnt say 3k day. said semantics matter. Lots people still dying daily. ""prophecy"" came true. ...Whoooo blame? Who, who, who, (i really wanna know)... Trump blew early on, middle continues blow day. blaming everyone else. Fauci might perfect, he's least done best keep things getting worse opposed actively making worse. it‚Äôs intentional week alone, 6000 Americans perished Covid19.

We owe them, loved ones, wear mask memory remind us duty Americans stand one another look persons immediate community. No, research prove masks effective time. think lot people would mind taxes hell lot less weren‚Äôt living paycheck paycheck made living wage. went graduate school barely got living wage. Man, think want job. tried earlier year impeachment (seems like way longer that) GOP love power love Constitution wellbeing country. 

We're gonna try November, wish us luck. Wooooo U.S.A! U.S.A! I'm interested brag testing capabilities actually anything curb spread. think testing cures COVID? Poor people dont shove money mattresses . spend it. Immediately. Ludicrous Even recovered, lung damaged. enough time show badly damaged long term. bizarre. Every time look around, masks face. death count really low many cases. sounds like already made mind looking validation boyfriend trying convince otherwise. I'd stick gut stay away. likely fine went there, there's small chance could end horrible situation. also probably really anxious least days wait see feel sick really worth IMO. Without trying create multi-paragraphed argument - would suggested done different situation? Fauci follows data, data/reports flipped towards supporting masks, he. else could done? done swap, surely things would *even* worse, right?

How anyone deal maverick President? Well going say I'm culture grew alot us got along color going say grew saying everywhere. never like governer us dont match stereotype bingo like much. Northerns need look right people way say like southerns need looked like less like rich man poor person. plenty times time north say I'm people view much different didn't. good way either. say southern stop judging like said everyone......But enough act somehow better us. I'll see raise another 10K. already mask requirements stores live, dumbfucks wear mask nose pull whole thing chin enter store. Employees customers (myself included) correct morons one knows crazy anyone anymore. country stupid handle public health crisis. Covid wasn‚Äôt considered pandemic time. complacency might get kick pants evictions coming sports/entertainment distract middle class folks. hope things resolve peacefully, coup limited ballot box November, surprised violence escalates. crazy super strict 1-2 month lockdown would solved problem. Instead we're month number ...whatever fuck is...and we've made progress. jus Wuhan. means safety too. Meanwhile get happy 25 citations lol. Wait. Hold up. worried enough get tested....then, waiting results....you hanging mother...who recovering surgery? 

The fuck wrong you? He's talking shit internet. thought 50k, are. Nothing surprises anymore. Yeah everyone follows leader, common sense prevails sometimes. Lets hope happens near future winter. I'm surprised even able tell. They‚Äôre due liability dawning realization huge number people simply shop masks aren‚Äôt mandated. countries scientists correct beginning.  Fauci wrong something elementary?  mask preventing spread infectious disease really advanced concept.  ‚Äúnew information‚Äù.  It‚Äôs theory needed cutting edge research prove out. Furthermore, didn‚Äôt say needs information determine masks work, said masks didn‚Äôt work, enough information determine wearing mask doesn‚Äôt help.   

Fauci intentionally spread disinformation public fear would supply chain problem masks similar toilet paper/hand sanitizer.  wasn‚Äôt originally didn‚Äôt know masks helped stop spread covid, suggesting.  nation‚Äôs top scientists intentionally lied efficacy masks. Danes longer advised traveling Swedish regions Halland, Kalmar V√§rmland. 
The Ministry Foreign Affairs chosen adjust travel guideance, means unnecessary travel three Swedes regionsHalland, Kalmar V√§rmland longer discouraged.
The ministry informed press release .

The Ministry Foreign Affairs also allows Danes travel Tunisia, Uruguay Georgia. However, Uruguay Georgia entry restrictions quarantine requirements Danish travelers.

#Several regions open

The changes based weekly figures Statens Serum Institut, Ministry Foreign Affairs follows assess infection coronavirus falls.

The ministry already opened entry V√§sterbotton, Kronoberg, Sk√•ne Blekinge Sweden.

Unnecessary travel rest Sweden still discouraged. total 76,877 people confirmed infected coronavirus Sweden.

#Reopening Greenland

While large parts Sweden still kept closed Ministry Foreign Affairs' travel guides, soon even easier get Greenland.

From Tuesday, Greenland thus enter phase three country's reopening, writes media KNR.

That means restrictions many allowed travel country per week.
Since 15 June, maximum 600 people week access Greenland.

On Tuesday, requirement people come Greenland home quarantine five days arrival also removed. Yup. They‚Äôll say die punished God sins live spared piety. needs apocalypse? there‚Äôs nobody left infect won‚Äôt learned goddamn thing. Canadian, urge Canadians sign petition:

""The gist: government going anything help point. big kids now! Get behave yourselves. quit expecting support. enforcement. coming.""

It intended blame public, truth. government done helping. individuals now. keep asking hoping, expecting setting oneself disappointed. Maybe actually responsible thing EXPAND testing capability. states 20% positivity means testing rate low. Anyone thinks hoax forced ~~bear witness they~~ load these. blame parent ? kid raised better known schoolwork. parents start taking responsibility kids making dumb choices? Excuse me, 77k cases day? That's literally madness fact going get worse ... Yup, credit governor handling crisis well point (RI). governors left holding bag President hot potatoed them. Desantis FAILED point. Can't wait $350 fine getting vaccine. 

These anti-maskers never stop. Trump stand way science. It‚Äôs testing! /derp conditioned subliminally programmed without intelligence realize it. shortage slow learners topic. Swedish nurses speak ""general assessments"" gone elder care wherein many times patients given individual assessment given pallative care (aka morphine help die faster, oxygent IV drips try keep alive). thoughts this. Trump inflating numbers he'll drop slowly show world ""most"" cases ""is best president world bring cases down, elect joe cases trillions"" Equating social motivation event ability transmit disease even retarded people staying away US? Sounds like we‚Äôre quite pickle literally opposite. Young people listening wearing masks. Boomers getting together big groups refusing wear masks. sad discreetly report employer everyday enforced wear masks Yay beating Canada! We've proven great more. USA! USA! USA! still believe. attack Twitter. Crazy fools. Maybe don‚Äôt give fuck, tell Dutch still appreciate Canadian sacrifice WW2.  everywhere. Netherlands could barely handle load patients. lucky enough one big breakout virus, could spread patients country even Germany. I'm pretty sure winter another outbreak, common cold normal flu go around, people stay inside bad ventilated rooms. USA numba wan really partisan politics worst. Republicans nitpicking lawful orders make look good. end it‚Äôll cost lives.  evidence car accident fatalities actually decreased? increased March despite half month lockdown csnt find recent months data. People always claim cant find actual Walgreens announces following suit, lying. voluntary leadership whisper customers non-mask wearers case case basis. everyone allowed shop there, whether mask mandate place not. Pockets high immunity still herd immunity though. Herd immunity applies population large. school priority pandemic. People really want send kids school potentially get infected get older people sick. 

If nation properly socially distance wear masks since March, going work? different people wanting sports Man kept saying be, be. Hospitals be, staff be, morgue be. gonna see actual overflow? do, isnt going away. Panic always exacerbates situation, bud. He's wrong. see 50,000 cases means almost 10,000 hospitalisations.

No lmao. That‚Äôs true Arizona, Texas, Florida.  ordered 300 million doses oxford vaccine. doesnt work every country gonna screwed, that's current front runner, moderna next, still havent started phase 3 yet. Spain bought tickets crazy train air- conditioned public transport, bars restaurants open loads Russian tourists. surprised much card info stolen pumps too. give local guards give obese Uncle Red dies. Rural Florida prison counties hit hard Apparently Oxford/AstraZeneca missed memo. march towards 100k looking real getting bonus beans, beans beans wisdom. think everyone send tootin‚Äô. stupid live. We're longer united states, we're bunch states handcuffed other. That's certain political group done us. Came say - thank you!! Hello FL!

A co-worker's sister daughter tested Positive said co-worker regular babysitter, got tested well. scheduled test SIX (6) days confirmed contact report.  


It 11 days still test results back. SO's bff work also self quarantine confirmed contact waiting 10 days results. 

As aside.. handle reporting totals previous days test result return times vary, long - would happen know? wondering July 4th gatherings would impact numbers, reporting delayed, accurate? That's true, FDA set standards. Think 'good' things America could get fix local, domestic international level. --- People like make things impossible.  able find verifiable information I'm assuming already know answer... COVID back end March, still carry it? would assume yes know people say get it, think also applies carrying it? Germs everywhere time, can't imagine ""immune"" can't still carry place place. ""IS""? mean ""has decades""?
Over 20 years manufacturing restaurants, honestly say I've never seen safety health inspector address anything serious. inspectors worked paid dont care. everyone else said - broken system. Idiocracy. 29,000 cases city, hard believe ? ? plenty data showing majority 19-29 range. Expect change Trump full control CDC numbers. shamelessly lie many cases November. Pray sun killing shit. is, winter comes going *bad*. sister needs go hospital roght now. see 90 % pulse ox already 50% oxygen delivery blood air. drop precipitous. everyone feels low oxygen too. people called happy hypoxics. worked Covid patients get around 90 high likelihood get worse. #Translation:

[Sweden] IVO's review geriatric care corona crisis shows many medically responsible nurses demand better contact regions. 
The Health Care Inspectorate examined 1,700 special homes [care homes] see acted spring. these, 91 homes judged major deficiencies IVO investigate detail summer. Among things, journals must reviewed.

As part review, medically responsible nurses, mas, municipalities private care providers interviewed. answers show many think cooperation regions needs improved.

#Daily Skype meetings crisis

- know turn nurse municipality need doctor on, says Kerstin Carlsson, mas S√§vsj√∂ chairman National Association Medically Responsible Nurses.

- important municipal health care good routines responsible what. get touch doctors make assessments together?

*How contact work work?*

- region, good collaboration. many years, Skype meeting every week municipality, health center inpatient care hospital work adjust situation. look like, patients have, patient stay hospital another day municipality receive good patient-safe way on.
 
- pandemic, meetings expanded intense phase Skype meeting every morning reconciliations situation looks like.

#Difficult get doctors housing

But work well everywhere, according interviews medically responsible nurses around country. Kerstin Carlsson says link municipal regional care sometimes lacking.

- feeling discussions association problems getting information getting doctors homes. tough health centers, difficult work situations work us, even though shortage doctors places.

- feel medical time would needed homes. important health centers receive sufficient resources able support us. patients take care them, must support doctors prescribe make assessments.

#General assessments patients

According Kerstin Carlsson, pressure inpatient care regions make difficult get doctors visit also often means discharges speeded order get elderly patients hospitals. **IVO's review shows many cases elderly given individual assessment corona spring.**

- **Personally, think strange general assessments made, bit scary. talk time looking patient needs work time. nurses assess patient contact doctor worrying abandoned it,** says Kerstin Carlsson.

- made general assessments, municipalities health centers medical centers? really clear yet. Sometimes nurses stand doctors clear assessment needed here. makes want simultaneously spread virus? stfu. mouth, 99 percent job prevent asymptomatic spread. Based comment screaming, sounds like dont know shit Stop hyping vaccine development. Even looking promising still year away one. age social media - message health care worker know AZ. said really bad hospital. know people understand want to. people holding back rest society centuries. Kentucky AG wants kill people. Got it. Hell 30 million cvs patients would like losing civil war asshole thing Wuhan health care workers saying... Italy (Northern region), US (Northern region) US (Southern region) somebody lives south, think that's totally accurate. 

I think people think risks associated PPE worth death rate dropped much has. Yeah, there's factors there, they're hearing want hear. Spirit moves things

^^/s Oxford phase 3 trial months now? Hmmm, yeah true... America terminal decline exactly listened encouraged admin, either. #####By Zortan's Sword! like turtles. States like NJ NY fear travellers states coming causing second outbreak. would interesting see similar episodes history. think people dismissed warnings, like Stalin regarding invasion USSR WW2. I'm trouble thinking one dismissed expert advice crisis though. cover drug approvals work 'As long make elections' lol mean sporting events, mean beaches public places rallies protests  someone says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why...‚Äù answer question first sentence, it‚Äôs ad hominem. literally said doesn‚Äôt understand something doesn‚Äôt work. reason he/she doesn‚Äôt understand *because* don‚Äôt understand economics. case contracting chickenpox young kid(as did), getting smallpox, polio, TB vaccines kid (and dont remember ever getting booster shot, im 34 now), lifelong immunity coming T-cell memory? no. absolutely not. anyone examines data level detail knows probably exceeded 100,000 cases per day weeks ago. Hahahahaha. You‚Äôre national treasure. April 3, 2020:
 Trump said Friday Centers Disease Control Prevention urging Americans wear mask leave homes, immediately undercut message repeatedly calling recommendation voluntary promising would wear one himself.

[A Debate Masks Uncovers Deep White House masks, going really voluntary thing,‚Äù president said beginning daily coronavirus briefing White House. ‚ÄúYou it. don‚Äôt it. choosing it..."" Arizona Texas ordered refrigerative trailers.

Georgia calling surrounding states asking ship ICU patients them.

Florida running ICU beds.

The bubbles burst argument.

Mr. 2 day old disinformation account. Phase 3 trials take months started yet. see effective vaccine best next year certain we'll ever get one. Good buddy.

I've lived Hawaii NYC Oregon last 50 years. trust health departments California China now. 

Also fuck federal government. want California fail.

Good luck. read this, feels like common sense untested asymptomatic mild cases would account difference. Brain's exactly working full capacity today, thanks clear patient explanation! That‚Äôs bad news us, Moderna sketchy company Oxford doesn‚Äôt great track record coronaviruses United States America. issue state‚Äôs handling, take federal government. helped anyone far. =\ start, Fauci said need masks go daily lives? effective? GOP cite extend unemployment benefits... Learn read dumbass. Fauci told people worry masks, problem there? Something something I'm idiot something something!!1!!! interview cordial respectful. amazing much diplomacy interview current administration entire term.

I'm amazed name dragged mud, resort kind name calling petty statements. class act.  every fucking thread Al Capone first Yep. Tough put genie back bottle telling people wear masks months... smh Build wall? Dude *entire* interview get implication hasn‚Äôt gotten ‚Äúbasic dignity‚Äù?

I understand real lunatics majority. Additionally must‚Äôve missed part says like pitted president. 

A little bit deductive reasoning lead conclusion probably doesn‚Äôt want pitted anyone exactly you‚Äôre doing.

Just let get message across stop spitballing whatever exaggerated reality you‚Äôre perceiving. remember models predicted 100,000 dead Sweden back March.

These fuckers consistently adjusted predictions Sweden:  know it‚Äôs bad situation corporations something specifically help people I'm glad still tell tale! New York 3rd world? Required... But... Not... Mandatory...?

Do understand English well thought did? Florida Governor good news tag literally nothing, know really fucked up. Must less brained, brains leadership, still didn‚Äôt it. Deniers come dismiss 3,2,1... Trump one intentionally lied public, Dr fauci did. perfect. admit uninformed disinterested becoming informed :) walking home past areas lots bars restaurants. definitely be. confirm cause death, I'd assume It‚Äôs terrible numbers aren‚Äôt even alarming anymore. expect every day. 

If told back March we‚Äôd see point 100k new cases per day I‚Äôd shit pants. hardly blink. go beyond that. mom lives 10 miles REALLY rural river destination Arkansas. community tends earn bunch late spring-summer-early fall. big income being, well, couple Tyson‚Äôs factories either direction hospitals twice far either way: small town hospitals. resort area insanely overcrowded people come, make messes, spread shit head back big cities ‚Äúescaping‚Äù.

How apply actual daily live unclear tbd. Right now, I'm trying remain constructive, focus job, good family friends, donate heavily important groups. ‚ÄúDeal it‚Äù even know herd immunity possibility yet. CDC correct we've undercounted infections X10, best case scenario 10% America infected we've already got close 140K dead. herd immunity even table would take forever get would genocide. genuinely hope viable treatment vaccine then. aren‚Äôt killing anybody,‚Äù conservative host declared April 2015 segment ‚ÄúRush Limbaugh Show,‚Äù argued tobacco users thanked purchases generate tax dollars fund children‚Äôs health care saying ought little appreciation shown them, instead hated reviled,‚Äù Limbaugh said. ‚ÄúI would like medal smoking cigars, I‚Äôm saying.‚Äù

This begin disagreement. may disagree providing counterpoint directly aimed GP's main point fueled contradition post. Ad hominem unacceptable society.  Brain degradation extreme you? as? trial design suggests otherwise  mean, reason anyone voted trump. That's even close said. Where's money coming pay massive shut down? going celebrate jerk. take ID idea and...well...you know. Sounds good hold accountable? Trump done sorts law breaking stuff isn‚Äôt held accountable.


Same Kemp. mean basically stole election smh Urgh  think 10 million active cases China right now. know that's bullshit right. Insurance covered Many cold war things actually still on-going, like Reagan's Star Wars became NASA Mars exploring Ôºåthe cyber-war starting 19's / 20's became fear HUAWIE (By way, India also looks horrible me.... ) , might new direction medical/public hygiene war(Really want say bio-war, although virus, Genetic modification insect etc. )

Is really Russia anyone matter, politics , greater good, benefits. title read ""another health care worker killed wilful incompetence US leadership""? also caught off-guard Missouri came Mississippi; second there, thought going go back L's look ""Land Mass"" instead. live Okinawa situation dire. work (nothing military bases), around island rumors 4th July parties cause outbreak, far cab driver infected, thankfully. So, seems cluster contained inside bases. Maybe, remember huge differences Sweden US.

Primary schools open time, yes. recommendations keep kids home kind symptoms anything, keep home they've symptom-free two days. And, Sweden, kid sick, stay home sick pay sick yourself, there's incentive parents ""have work"" send sick kids school anyway.

Sick leave sick pay systems generally shit US, schools open US, lot likely parents send sick kids school anyway, parents options.

So that's argument opening schools US.

Then again, there's also reports children seem bad spreaders. Common sense dictates children ever-sick snotgoblins, spreading disease filthy hands touching everyone everything. Except virus. reason know yet, seem spread one around. super weird.

So opening schools might much less risky people think. Weird countries fine closing down. evidently, won‚Äôt it. anti-science cult. response reminds elementary school. always fire drills. Marched single file fields away buildings. Kindergarten class small fire actual fire, teachers took everyone cafeteria building...

Even 4th grade time like gotta kidding me. early March. early April suggesting people use masks. Masks recommended since pretty much late Jan/Feb. 

At least news following told get masks, since stocked time.

I live Canada though might different people saying iceberg lie demanding stay course increase speed. think he‚Äôs kind super genius instead person reacting predictably external stimuli. already want scale back ""wasteful testing""

So soon might even able blame tests know. I‚Äôve felt helpless since March, it‚Äôs gotten worse. NOTHING man. He‚Äôs office 2023. Every day wake remember what‚Äôs going shock hits again. part true though? 

Having someone pay $100,000 year mean special today. make smart. 

Someone bragging 6 figures looks special though different way. I'll let others judge counting expertise.

There strategy.

Trump manifestly incompetent. always dealt things ""over head"" bribing, threatening, mocking. work virus -- [he's tuned enjoys, rallies running system (congress) force -- voters deeply associate personally, punish Republican turncoats. Republican congressional members cowardly would rather negligently kill hundreds thousands lose seats congress.

This lesson end *The Lord Flies*. sub captain rescue boys island, real terror one rescue sub captain horrors humanity expressed war plan. power save us Trump's incompetence. failure.!&lt; Vote well fall. Thanks. Stay safe there. It‚Äôs rough time industry.   Basically *lot* developing nations actually facing similar crises USA's. Sometimes abysmal choices top. 


But news bad USA, news outlets focused domestic markets here, much news front pages web places like Peru South Africa. Wow. Sanitize hands touching that! semi arrogant thing I‚Äôve ever heard. Keep Fauci Deal I'm little confused conversation. confirm, say ""Trump gave one"", talking asshole licking, correct? I'm west coast Canada, we've done really well here. even little confused masks relatively recently. Fauci one giving mixed messages masks early on. PSA: went shopping inside store today. wear bandanna mask tie behind head high ponytail stays snugly place. got pixie haircut yesterday, ponytail. Long story short- mask slipped nose &amp; idea, used mask &amp; breathe fine. really wish someone told mask slipped down. know everyone wants wear mask correctly, I'm wondering many, whose masks nose unaware it. I'm talking people right lip chin. make matters worse, I'd complained management employees following wear mask. I'm amazed point wearing mask nose! needs Morpheus‚Äô Pince Nez They'll keep going regardless whether see going up. Yet Fauci said ‚ÄúThe system not, really geared need right ‚Ä¶ failing, let‚Äôs admit it.‚Äù reasonably claim he's effective past statements would suggest even possible. could reasonably suggest single government position, even POTUS responsible systemic failure dating back decades? 80 days? hope lose job she'd debt millions. 15? actually effective call Trump bullshit. wtf where's mine? Except lie masks. Truth! People said 2016 well... paycheck powerful thing, look scientific studies tobacco oil industries put years endorsed scientists. need eat too. really cheat way in, Hillary looking pretty good now.

.... Fauci one make claim lot information -- valid criticisms act fast enough give right answer first time compiled data. 

It's WHO, declare pandemic use CDC definitions epidemic pandemic needed see sufficient community spread enough distinct regions first. enough data make hypothesis, wait get information. 

Places originally saying BLM spread Covid, protesting ongoing deaths important quickly picked stories preliminary investigations outdoor events spread well. reports also exist anti lockdown protests, variably successful based masks. 

We know one way definitively, evidence suggests 1) masks massively help prevent spread, 2) outdoor air circulation better closed air circulation systems indoors, 3) never 0% risk. 

If risk massively mitigated masks outdoors still non zero chance exposure virus, people need make judgement valid protest time, that's lot journalism is. 

Any journalism claiming events superspreaders needs provide lot evidence since every model shows outdoor protests spreading less projected. 73388 :'( 

Is highest thus far? NM made masks mandatory pretty much everywhere, fine misdemeanor assault charge possible punishment non-compliance. addition banning non-residents (read:Texans) state parks mandatory 14 day quarantines anyone arriving state. fucking around now. yeah think people dont realize bad economy = deaths related Covid 

therefore, coronavirus control certain areas, make sense lockdown result deaths could avoided nothing coronavirus TLDR: is.  like haters can't see him.

üé∫üé∫üé∫üé∫ I‚Äôve always said they‚Äôll dump ass exactly one second decide he‚Äôs become liability. I‚Äôm surprised surgical mask effective is. guess it‚Äôs good got along N95s. wish people would wear them. Idiocracy: Future US.  No, got it. Especially election playing big factor. We‚Äôre talking president got NWS lie cover bullshit assertion hurricane path, man got Fauci lie masks sugarcoat situation we‚Äôre in. Trump literally touted completely bullshit therapy asked injecting disinfectant... course he‚Äôs going pressure FDA approve literally anything quickly possible. also perpetuates classism. Rich kids safe, poor kids get sick(er) dead parents.

We can‚Äôt rely system ends classism. Education supposed great equalizer. Nevada‚Äôs reporting suspect Wanted share got work today. Someone handed told educate myself. threw away dug decided little knowledge do, follow lot health scientists twitter read it. I'm even American.

The HHS CDC numbers come together end HHS closer President terms organizational charting 'technically' sway them. Whether tries get Cabinet Secretary fudge things, delay them, outright deny another story.

The CDC numbers easily accessible provided researchers quick dedicated information research. HHS kind speed access researchers. course isn‚Äôt. infectivity dictated effectiveness response. states infected point generally little response, allows coronavirus maximally spread there.

I still haven‚Äôt figured what‚Äôs going California, though. *laughs foreign interference aided Republicans* Except silenced let‚Äôs send kids back schools fall...   Maybe. maybe sign things come places, too. States seem act like children, yes. new reality terrible strain everyone, people everywhere stress, desperate live ""normally"" again. Even ""adult"" countries may snap goes long enough. What's ""other countries""? 

In order, following European countries currently higher death per million number Sweden: San Marino, Belgium, Andorra, UK, Spain, Italy. 

If someone said months ago start pandemic ""hey Belgian Government, even super strict hard lockdown, cases deaths Sweden anti-lockdown country"" people would laughed called guy idiot.

Yet are...

Saying ""other countries"" vague one get. Even strict super lockdown, New Zealand still deaths per million ""other countries"" never nation-wide lockdown like Syria. That's ""other countries"" real argument. uhhh... i'm religious, amen incredible think wasteful testing hordes people still can't get tests get tested, take upwards month get results. is, haters man simply showing ignorance context: got email saying going go ahead huge convention early august, whereas every anime convention rescheduled next year  much I‚Äôd love this, would wait till 2024 would 84 =\ Yeah, actually number 2 children‚Äôs hospital country, dipshit. future's bright, he's gotta wear shades. Good luck defend statewide lockdown next... I'm going Halloween house. cause community spread won‚Äôt even want go grocery store? close getting it. Eh nope. many others stage now. hit paywall, please refer [this archived link copy *Every licking thread  I'm glad someone else said it, feel like play pedant far often. harmful UV radiation.

Badass mofo üëå Didn‚Äôt Kentucky lots excess pneumonia deaths year? numbers garbage. like West Virginia. Victoria specifically traced outbreaks home visits relatives friends. Nobody knows cases uncertain origin. Likely dozens contributing causes. pretty hard stage rule gathering cases present contributing factor not.

I get multiple contributory factors something many people seem fail grasp. happens. get deaths demand comply.

Florida Texas pretty stubborn though. Maybe limit. fair, think we‚Äôre gonna look back Trump years reminisce batshit crazy were.  Since Fox News ever reliable source anything? ain‚Äôt Bonnie Henry 67 employees. many family members club members club members families spread too? Reckless . sure mask distancing like Fauci lot, hope there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing initial recommendation wear masks. understanding preserve front line workers, that‚Äôs excuse flat lie. ‚ÄúDeal it‚Äù

üòé guess die then, idk point even saying phase three successful story, hype. that's man take complement  mind-controlled virus,how scary! employees give shit, specifically told confront customers wearing one. 1000 deaths today.

Have got yet? extremely poor taste considering nation last four months. I'd call asshole, would insulting assholes. 

Hey doctor? masks goddamn important, many people kill told us need them? No. areas reduce testing high numbers are. They're using limit actually get tested. Whatever numbers are, definitely lower actual number cases. 

I work Mayo. incredibly frustrated.  see 23 people wearing masks six people wearing masks. count people see clearly. people wore masks. second picture people front wearing masks look crowd people wearing masks. third picture it‚Äôs fifty fifty. last picture see majority people wearing masks. four cherry picked examples, majority people wearing masks except one. 

Not sure you‚Äôre seeing. off, 65% number. Sorry right big fish hook covid19 USA. Nono source recently found intentionally lying American people knew needed masks help slow spread.

At start, think cause Fauci would told us wear masks public would completely dismantled already crippled hospital supply masks PPE.

They knowingly lied help keep hospital shortage bay untill enough supply mandate everyone wear one. (like what's happening across US)

This means knew masks helped slow spread ultimately limit death. I'm sure argument something like ""more people die hospitals reach max capacity must safeguard supplies future shipments hospitals, even means lying American people"" 

Did people die Fauci's initial statements telling American people wear masks go daily lives? must went lunch box Dr. Fauci would even effective Donald Trump defective. feeling India may worst hit time ends Worst part kids me, still clue long term effects disease might be... Earth would anyone risk child getting something cure could potentially life-changing/crippling effects road? city recently mandated masks public, boss (small restaurant business) requiring co-workers wear masks. do? contact local health department?

I want take action protect customers community, want restaurant get shut down, also need job. Dude class fucking act. Defends saying single iota negative trump anyone. guy pro literally SOLEY cares public health. u/undeleteparent cheating.

On plus side, Russian vaccine used fuel additive lower CO2 emissions coffee maker. wish could say employer already mandating masks customers, they're regional chain mandated home state Wal-Mart announcement. Even then, week ahead time.

Tomorrow, ""requiring"" masks customers entering premises. Managers stationed entry patrolling store ensure customers wearing masks. However, given power actually refuse entry simply refuse wear mask. script policy, ""medical reasons"" wear mask included script, that's it. 

No one actually turned away door. one physically removed store. Period.

Corporate really care. They're trying appease orders state government imposed, actively get involved enforcement policy. meantime, continue put health well-being risk playing political glad-handing game they've long since stopped paying us ""hero bonus"" many retailers giving hourly employees early weeks pandemic turned sideshow free ice cream days extra coupons discounts nonessential items.

Don't think one minute major retailer announcements actually mean damn thing. They're paying lip service giving shit communities continue profit loss smaller retailers areas driving people away doors.

I apologize right thread cut loose things, point everyone store reached wits end nonsense retailers acting like care what's going on.

I working Day 0 first shutdown wave (the moment announced state rushing hand sanitizer floor) worked 40 hours week every week since, turned overtime left wide open exhausted keep working, gone every length limit exposing loved ones process, put rude abrasive comments customers, watched good people lose jobs take worked half death appease corporate hoo-rah mindset said keep heads down, keep smiling, rise meet demand even demand wholly unreasonable driven greed, fear, paranoia.

I implore all; take sweeping statements retailers seriously see eyes actually ENFORCING policies, call bullshit loudly ones aren't.

I can't speak retailers, I'm naming place employment still work would like continue working there, please believe say whatever corporate tomfoolery going us really want help. want safe shopping experience, want get things need (even need something distract awful there), want able feel safe ourselves. 

None possible company puts statement saying they'll require masks. statements mean nothing enforced, enforced there's always another neighborhood open store one shuts down. There's always unemployed teacher willing work $9 hour replace ten year veteran employee making $13.

I could go days actually like working conditions call examples would care hear, I'm sure plenty people Reddit experiencing thing different banner, I'll end here.

Shenzhen side, 3 months buildings closed completely non residents non workers. temperature check even go outside, mask absolutely mandatory. Contact tracing major thing, even get bus train someone it, pinged tested cleared even use metro (subway) bus again.

I simply can't see types people dealing once. US never ending wave, places dealing recurring flare ups. much blame government (and man government US HUGE amount blame earned), people need display social responsibility well.

I've spent 17 years helping school, lunch, school buying supplies like pencils pocket kids need. draw line health family health. people pushing person learning going is:

1. Screw online learning. matter time shut districts invest quality (cost) programs online starting person. children get sub-par instruction compared quality online program administered teacher time train said program.
2.

3. Put disadvantaged children risk. children often times access health care many african american higher risk comorbidities worse outcomes. Disadvantaged parents education also often times pay attention news understand science math. means really understand risks tempted treat like flu. also means might know symptoms key indicators necessary hospital trips.
4. Screw online learning. district knew going online learning could work find need devices connectivity. district least that. districts would invest items know going online. matter prioritizing cost since school district get much money. university study properly provide sanitation PPE would cost small district 1.3 million year. buy whole bunch devices that. local cable company also student special Covid here.

The decision based assumption summer travelers would primarily families smaller groups would still sit together. Without business commuting business travel, single travelers expected could still separated.

It‚Äôs hilarious Trump doesn‚Äôt read briefings. doesn‚Äôt listen experts. He‚Äôs uneducated buffoon. Trump actually listened Fauci, I‚Äôd understand insistence Fauci‚Äôs complicity little more. Fauci would full control executive response, would extremely different situation right now.

Is perfect? No. one saying is. make tactical errors? Yes. What‚Äôs hilariously though apologists right cling hard nitpicks Fauci use broad forgiving brush rest admin. higher risks catching dying virus ? so, yes. Right front line healthcare workers, front line essential services workers elderly. ...but force supermarket employees restaurants workers go work let collect unemployment even afraid, susceptible, elderly high risk, because...too bad. They're biggest losers world. That's experiencing Trump's victory vicariously, even technicality Constitution, important them. regret wearing mask too.

Chill bro northwest part Finland large number people Swedish descent still connected Sweden. Vaasa really hub part Finland. That‚Äôs part there‚Äôs many cases traced Sweden real reason everyone came anti-mask beginning. employer trying say masks send wrong message patients getting ready send staff home wear work. Fortunately Gov. Murphy came rescue mask mandate. Otherwise ready get fired it. employer still sketchy masks, everything lip service policies paper prevent lawsuits enforcement. I'm still minority job wearing mask entire shift. Employers need 3rd party oversight surprise audits mask compliance. can't depend employers enforce employee mask mandates. labor intensive many indifferent pandemic. glad live NJ wish task force audit mask compliance. friend told day doesnt know anyone seriously ill disease, doesnt really think problem. 

I also know one ever seriously ill *most* diseases. guess arent problem either. Florida putting covid patients nursing homes... possible know broadly extrapolated, nice note least survey shows overwhelming majority couples Denmark actually seen benefit partnerships crisis. makes sense Denmark, lockdown moderate debatable whether term applies, people time together encourage go things ""fresh air"" they'd happier generally, inclu. other. Cool! Open schools! course traits would lead flouting social distancing, many people really like this? author states error formula, like political ideology. would interesting see factors common majority flouting guidelines. would guess people narcissistic socio psychopaths, least US. one gets news seems biggest predictor here. Maybe written ""good ol' boy"". help. got know exactly group referring to. proudly wear, paste, hang fly rebel flag. bosses construction sites, local mechanic, high school teacher, local mayor, state representative, governor that, behind closed doors sometimes not, say, do, activity undermine worse work black person. good ol' boy network south calling generalization ""white boy"" also racist understandable. term used colloquialism does, south, call mind specific subgroup. right, sure white boys fall ""White Boy"" category. Well... yeah. course are. 

The US getting almost many cases *per day* Canada **has gotten total**. 

Think that. Canada handled situation particularly well either (Though obviously better USA) we're shining star, we're still top 20 world deaths despite smaller population. imagine buying Cleveland Browns.....twice. Ew...... ‚ÄúQuick, take money we‚Äôre forced pay creditors!‚Äù Guess CNBC probably reuse article multiple times minor modification. dumbest thing ever read. I'm sure that's frustrating, hope regret it. He's good job bad circumstances that's something proud of. Sweden‚Äôs society seems lot capacity social distancing US. people live alone due higher average salary. Population density relatively low. lot random factors seem work favor.

They basically enough shit that, combined summer that‚Äôs warm hot, allowed r0 drop 1. US sort passive response government enough given different structure society. Republican majority. would never pass governor called special session. would also long process committees readings votes.... committees readings votes again. That's great Round 2 battle debate besides wearing mask: ""Are kids virus transmission covid-19 adult people?"" can‚Äôt believe reached new low, administration knows low really go. sure going find real soon. adamant ""facts"" keep ejaculating to, provide link support point.

Well, seek information yourself. father obliged teach would waste time looking I'm ""ignorant"",

Well looked up, would ignorant anymore. Google countries used masks beginning look stats worldofmeters. I'm day five. people experience months. USA shattering records. USA #1 cost lot nothing compared untold economic damage cause.

It's even radical, exactly countries done. almost like entire government sabotaged inside. 100% right virus causing death due affects blood lungs. saw scary report eve asymptomatic people micro clots every organ. mean awful virus. fuck homework something go jail for? know many shitbrains high school didn‚Äôt homework ever?

However, think communication aspect extremely important way communicate dense science denier different communicate someone understands science. years field, start lose sight that. hasn‚Äôt.

We said like flu overreacting.

*I cut pasted writer. MASK CASKET. Oh completely see point. I'm saying happen. saw many close together major points interest. I'm sure folks trails fine. ones mainly drive around. 
 local area limited stores going see huge numbers folks. 
 Good news day glacier opened nearby community started mask order indoor space. Hopefully helps see tourists refusing that's another issue.

Stay safe. say it? makes perfect sense; creates context statement, redefining scale comparison.

Yes, ""with due"" related amount given, no, ""with due modesty"" make sense redefine scale comparison. focusing wrong part makes make sense. 

The actual common phrase ""[with due makes sense, *respect* something given, preface ""with due"" means amount respect given due (appropriate) amount; means ""the amount respect given deserved amount."" 

Here's modesty can't used phrase:

1) ""Modesty"" given anyone. behavior, attitude oneself. Modesty ""due"" sense whatsoever. 

2) ""due"" *amount* modesty. standard deserved amount. Yes, modesty exist varying degrees, one owed particular amount (because even make sense) amount expected owed shown anyone. 

It make sense say ""the amount modesty deserved amount,"" that's phrase grammatically means. 

The best approximation meant ""with due modesty"" would ""I'm showing appropriate amount modesty,"" 1) that's actually meaning actually said 2) corrected phrasing completely contradictory claim ""redefining scale comparison,"" completely irrelevant. fact Fauci invent brilliant throw-away remark off-the-cuff, also demonstrates clever is.

He invent phrase. changed *one word* *already common phrase* way make sense.

I agree he's brilliant. He's professional empathetic person. 

But he's perfect, explanation defending remark makes even less sense said. NYC - Deep State Fake - hospitals empty!! mean, walk emergency room empty!!! 

Yeah, jackass, that's COVID patients quarantined already. I'm done conspiracy theories. Fingers crossed it‚Äôs less increasing rate increasing last week also started hoarding numbers federal level may trustworthy.

Deaths aren‚Äôt much higher rate starting correlate recent case spikes still slightly higher last weeks death spike.

Experiment see masks entertainment venues closing plateau bring down. It‚Äôll hurricane fucks them. Hurricane season likely coincide second wave, need one bad hurricane send bunch people hospital, render bunch people homeless, exacerbate outbreak. Better talk probation first place. like that's good, usual thing fifteen year old ^^  talked guy day....that ""doesnt think big deal"" 200,000 dead summers end. ""we many people anyway""

O.o becoming? well people dying today causes born, place would negative population growth rate. wait required. Even people bleeding bullet wounds? would rather workers union hospital OSHA. level stupidity happen own. takes decades government lying people people get point matter government says believe it. fact, often believe exact opposite assuming government lying. matter proof provided, ignore also assume manipulated false. 

Don't get wrong, insane wear mask pandemic. Even gov lying, costs nothing wear mask. mention, whole world lying... know virus real. 

But level disconnect reality many showing, believe, large part result governments lost trust citizens. hope keeping maintenance house! money = happy. Probably statistically makes little difference. positive cases go another state that‚Äôs already reporting 500+ new cases day, it‚Äôs going change handling it.

We completely failed contact tracing, can‚Äôt even get people prompt test results, unless states step positive people isn‚Äôt going change things big picture. That's getting at. post responded using raw numbers instead per capita...the per capita numbers still look bad bad. [Highly type ass backward logic this? cares supporting bum office people Georgia. UK we‚Äôve flipped negative # deaths vs 5-year average couple weeks now. Fewer people dying regular flu due distancing measures probably + reducing COVID cases. one data point. Science work able cite data point favor position. needs consideration data available systematic study done. Science headline leads politicization talking past one another. Idiots shoud stand way human progression (science) survival (common sense). knew discussing coworkers coworkers due Trump loyalty (Obama lame duck time) ratted out. MIL lives texas. Took us month get mask up. 3 months good MIL masking. happens abuse Temporary Foreign Worker program get staff really want get Canada shot residency. Sorry language


Oh god said ""fuck"". Give NSFW tag next time. Agreed. shit makes blood boil. can‚Äôt attribute kind behavior pure ignorance - it‚Äôs straight malice point.  never said things bad US...I even said defending US, using raw numbers compare 2 extremely different population groups flawed. Mandated vaccine without exemption given medical doctor then. like ~~we~~ places schools. cretin poses canned beans screams inanity. 2 separate groups. Group 1 goes M&amp;Th, group 2 goes T&amp;F. Nah, non-sheep people understand data collection human-error nightmare, errors data collection \*always\*. also understand anecdotal evidence misreporting incident indication humans still involved screw up, larger dataset still valid.

It's common tactic American right call anyone believes something true leaders right say false. comical thing, people right herded idea. Whereas Bible clearly predicted we're gonna die! Hail Jeebus! feel bit bad, mean kick anyone lying down, it‚Äôs upsetting watch mayhem here.

Crossing fingers speedy effective vaccine, rest globe. Speaking anecdotally people see working jobs last confrontation lunatics definitely get saying worth it. often retirees big stores. certainly could hire bouncer types that's probably undesirable job moment. 

The problem really mindset got people afraid beyond us solving. would take years restructuring media people consuming drive tribal groups. Imagine speed too. line people walk past dog. Unfortunately, winter, testing may moot point. starts spreading exponentially, would seem point testing rather pointless. see article lazy reporting rushed article clicks. seems unlikely someone going go asked put mask full assaulting someone response. article‚Äôs witnesses statements. initially estimate least 3 people around victim time incident. worker, women allegedly assaulted another random women tried push according witnesses. also conclude witness statements commotion continued, people kept coming aisle surrounding him.

‚ÄúThe witness said man continued screaming woman pushed cart her. also said saw another woman try push man way.‚Äù

Clearly argument turned physical people coming aisle. initial argument started employee another customer allegedly rammed man cart. immediately pushed another women response according witness statements. aisle, man surrounded least one employee, two female customers two witnesses. incident turned physical.

""I coming end aisle sudden heard commotion people getting aisle,"" witness said. ""I looked guy yelling someone, sudden see him, know, take handles cart try ram woman."" also reside NorCal.

The people want wear masks already wearing them. people don‚Äôt continue go stores bypass ‚Äúmedical reasons‚Äù wear mask. That's reasonable explanation. yet, odd heard even one single time regarding situation throughout last seven months, especially declared epidemic.

Don‚Äôt overestimate impact ‚Äútreatments‚Äù. found remdesivir works... get rid symptoms bit faster. effect mortality (though *might* one, would modest *if* exists). Steroids work reducing mortality. already knew ARDS, good hospitals already that. Prone positioning might impact. Early identification thrombosis, prophylactic anticoagulation prevent thrombosis, might help. places already that. 

I would estimate reduced mortality (so long ventilator skilled worker availability never issue) since began, maybe 0.8% 0.7%. Yes, it‚Äôll make huge difference population scale, it‚Äôs modest best. treatments either 1) impact death someone would died anyway without treatment, 2) prolong interval death someone would died anyway, 3) change anything someone would lived anyway, 4) cause harm someone would harmed without treatment (bleeding anticoagulation, liver failure remdesivir), 5) prevented death. 1-3 definitely likely 4 5. got babe  1 case many, especially unit. kind screening control allows anyone positive even get close ward? Unacceptable incompetence. result electing c n e r v v e ... gotten checked out? havent Id say go safe. could seen coming? Okay what‚Äôs point though. gonna wearing one either way Fucks sake, even studies this? common sense. Kids run around snot-nosed, touching everything, yelling screaming face, can't expected cognizant spreading germs.

*Of fucking course* spread shit. There's 300 million people US, I'm supposed believe literally half nation disabled now? disagree virus dangerous, numbers clearly wrong. That's specifically Republicans operate , via budget cuts unnecessary rules.

Now pure antithetical leadership corrupt admins think it‚Äôs important investigate deaths reported Covid. crucial good understanding thing kills tackle better. 

I‚Äôm excited deaths investigated everywhere, even U.K. let‚Äôs see ends happening death rate. actual empirical studies suggest covid presents differently young children, far less likely spread covid air. order spread air, need lot respiratory tract. 

I still think can't open schools unless levels really low surrounding communities adults working still spread vulnerable, kids catch like anyone else. best understanding right kids much less likely spread it.

My understanding studies regarding schools shut schools business usual. WATCH COME - Covid, probably speak way much logic common sense adult disney fans able comprehend want fact remains many places hard lockdowns seeing new cases per day go again, Sweden‚Äôs still going hard.

All nordic countries going hard, need compare completely different countries.

And lockdowns work perfectly get initial numbers continue light measures that. Look germany, perfectly. economy employment numbers looking hella better sweden's :) like 970 US today. sad  kakistocracy, combination thereof. young eager Covid-parties... Fuck them, despise them. They‚Äôre scum. Whiny, entitled, fucking scum. elaborate way asking moron using it?

How hard wear loose fitting clothing gloves use push stick? sad pathetic become country....people dont care 140,000 dead rising? o.O take?! people dont go ""meh"". 500,000? BioNTech also plans available December, Imperial College early next year (their vaccine aims reach ‚Äòall billions people around world), it‚Äôs exactly long timescale One physician friends COVID patient ICU right believe COVID real. Imagine trying treat someone disease think exists. See following: successfully prohibited competitor importing safety technology. $1,200. Yup don‚Äôt trust government get things done efficiently well. Dismantle politician‚Äôs salaries. Ok, bot. lol kids human? yes? ok spread virus.

Who even started rumor kids dont spread it? dumb be? kids germ spreaders society. People enough. Sorry said per capita . Also hundreds thousands New Yorkers fled state nyc us ghost town. New York failed Florida failing . Protests conclusively didn‚Äôt make worse. Everyone wore masks.

The people protesting mask wearing, hand.... Crazy amount winning, nearing od levels winning all. chest felt really tight reason breathless. took break felt better 30 seconds. do, however, friends family asthma fine long take break need (and inhaler). make sure appropriately safely. past track record prominent government response recently. 

But point public track record handling virus well. track record bad, mask episode shows acted bad faith.

The right recognizes track record well. left shockingly ignores track record anti-Trump. tried report company selling rotten food. nobody cares. Experiment Went Wrong. 

Now get die DeSucker admit idiotic experiment went wrong. Schools places learning. Hell, even daycares. low-income students also light medical centers, conditions diabetes managed, screening common childhood diseases happen, vision tests administered. kids get 2 3 meals day school reduced cost. 

Another overlooked aspect modern schooling in-person attendance help teachers students identify report physical sexual abuse outside school, well suicidal ideation. Schools often frontline defense catching small medical problems get bigger. 

Here's pretty good rundown things schools people often think about. solutions problems one size fits approach going work anybody. Agreed, petition giving us much credit. 

It‚Äôs showing Texas Florida little 5,000 new cases. Twice Texas 3 times Florida daily. worse SARS.

It's thing earlier strains SARs lethal get far share everyone.

Took knees healthy young person.

COVID19 less lethal successful similar things internal organs.

Autoimmune disorders also attack internal organs, even teeth.

Sars-cov-2 make autoimmune causes chronic fatigue syndrome. looked like rough 55. guy look young healthy even Ohio standards. Reported deaths per also considered. Florida currently less fifth NY. No, want civil unrest. ""No no, sister died *with* Covid, *of* Covid."" Exactly, although think he‚Äôs talking AstraZeneca. It‚Äôs university developing vaccine. Imperial College London partnered VacEquity Global example think article might helpful.

And plus.

- S. Korea, TTI program institutionalized, backed law.

- law, major local governments ( provinces metropolitan cities ) hire epidemic investigators. Last month, law revised every municipality larger hundred thousand residents hire epidemic investigators. Currently Gyeonggi Province 60 investigators, biggest army among local governments. KCDC army investigators dispatch necessary.

- Epidemic investigators direct contact tracing jurisdiction also fieldwork wearing hazmat suits buildings places outbreaks occurred. authority judge 'close contacts' order self-quarantine two weeks. interview patients contact tracing cooperating giving false info may lead legal punishment. also access surveillance records public/private sectors, phone gps logs, credit card transactions, CCTV records, etc., without search warrant emergency.

- qualification job medical license, dental license, least master's degree epidemiology. Actually postions filled public health doctors, form compulsory service. service time, become sergeon doctor working public health center. also work epidemic investigator. somewhat flexible. Reason followed comment stating source erroneous, yes. gave some, gave (in order reopen economy prove virus hoax)

Thanks sacrifice brother, appreciate seeing 401k balance tick wee bit. Right, don‚Äôt 4 states making numbers. ton states climbed to, above, 1k mark. would think states testing capability hit 2k day mark. alone would put us 100k day. probably won‚Äôt come states close maxed out. could predicted except everyone outright banning cigarettes despite killing thousands every year catering individualism.

Asking friend.  science identify risk without us race variable, then, obviously, race taken account. race independent predictive variable, raises uncomfortable questions. next question would degree race independent predictive variable, feasibility arriving precise risk estimates based inherent biological characteristics may associated race, race-variables themselves.

So, sum - race independent risk variable considerable magnitude, better indicators (even correlate heavily race) identified, yes - would proper consider race circumstances. doubt come pass, since race dubious scientific classification reliably meaningful biological concept, typically much better analyzing genetic markers biological variables - may correlate highly socially constructed ideas race, nonetheless rest steadier scientific ground.

So I'd say unlikely circumstance arise using race prioritize vaccine distribution would appropriate. better close border Sweden keep people safe least try something infection rate Sweden. says otherwise? Covid-19.... first entity successfully take world modern era. ü§Ø Makes China look like rookies. k Thanks replying.  live NY every major people attraction closed. people wears masks public numbers keep creeping upwards too.  

I‚Äôm bracing economic disaster state. I‚Äôm expecting many restaurants, gyms, feeder companies, movie theaters, hospitality/tourism businesses close within next 6 months. Wow you‚Äôre quick judge eh? 

1) mother home seven siblings time. can‚Äôt assume places could separately. 

2) exposed time brother whose friend tested positive. (This brother lived own). 

3) Luckily, everyone family takes precautions wears masks idiots. didn‚Äôt end getting virus even though exposed. Soon....soon. Uh oh. Cognitive dissonance incoming 3, 2, 1... why... interesting TBIs witnessed? Yes, already vaccine swine flu making several years prior. thousandth. visualize, eraser standard pencil ~5 mm.

Which still seems big. Like mesh mask isn‚Äôt helpful (unless you‚Äôre wearing something like cotton it). give contact information upon entering pub, makes tracing lot easier. Try America people would physically assaulted asking name address phone number. people would post social media location services turned everything sign credit card receipts. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è get sentiment. Things awful. vaccine. Things get better. new normal. normal now.

Things change. Businesses feel empowered make employees wear masks flu season. Good thing. Fewer people shake hands. Good thing. companies embrace flexible work arrangements. Good thing. vaccine(s) end pandemic push back anti science anti Vax sentiment anything. Good thing. Governments far vigilant pandemics. Good thing. 

I think we're probably halfway things. Maybe slightly less that.

I think spring 2021 we'll mostly back normal. Germany split classes 2 groups everyone beeing different times order prevent spread(and masks entire time). noteworthy time Germany way less active cases state US infects daily. Prima nocta oh boy! Look z score means kids go bring home COVID Unfortunately there's chance false negative even skewed local subreddit focus, keep pressure boost investigations cases. understanding New Zealand never mask mandate still part higher alert tiers, they've alert level 1 due full containment country still close borders continue watch new outbreaks within country.

While 25 active cases last count, within managed isolation thus pose threat general population. old coworker wife got it. classic symptoms. Took 2 weeks test negative. wife still can‚Äôt smell taste. know someone gotten it. countries like Australia Germany, exactly 200 negative people testing positive case?

Obviously people symptoms illnesses. contact tracing? Seems like huge number that.

I guess I'm asking US suddenly got 12x number tests, would used effectively reduce spread?

Aside rough places thry pulled back testing, im wondering states alreasy mid low single digits. thry testing front? people expend 1000 times energy trying get work would work. Americans accept shit work conditions, ""normal""

In countries normal (by law, like mine):

- Sick leave pay job security
- Holiday leave pay
- Maternity pay (both parents)
- pay minimum wage allowed (all ""servers"" livable wage, tips necessary)

You could argue slaves better modern American workers.

Now brainwashed Americans holy duty fucking downvote! Everything Florida done wrong. ‚Äúmandatory lock down‚Äù 2 weeks never got enforced, ignorant people refuse wear masks. can‚Äôt wait mask mandate COMPANIES enforce government isn‚Äôt right thing. 

I hope everyone brain stays safe, know smart people die other‚Äôs poor decisions. it‚Äôs bullshit, we‚Äôre outside 2 standard deviations according Z score OP seems think Z score 1.79 ‚Äúgood‚Äù despite fact figure puts week question around top 10% deadliest weeks Sweden‚Äôs history. 


Guys, basic statistics, z score measures distance average standard deviations. 1 standard deviation = deaths greater 68% outcomes, 2 v deaths greater 95% outcomes. z score 1 pretty terrible referencing deaths given country. tragedy measure. Charles Koch would rather pay fine someone dying pay repair degrading facility killed them. 

How would OSHA stand someone like Koch much money? Especially since every time Koch ""sticks man"" gets boner. Happy cake day Cringe! English first language I'm pretty sure shoulda regular who. right? always highlight otherwise, highlight ""**Given spread people, greater risk**"" ""gives letter writers, **to certain extent**, right point view spread infection""? translated part ""is opening rules could changed"" also sounds like happen, read might discuss it.

But real put 200 miles day truck. I'm far away anything, stuff really far apart South Oregon. need get work supplies 80 miles. need sandwich 20. let's open disney world! \o/ SPORTS :D could crime

It is. hospitals get COVID money, hurt Trump, Gates, Fauci, conspiracy, blah blah blah. prime example they'll citing proof.

Co-worker explained yesterday COVID magically go away election this. originally believed virus real, since become *woke*... Environmental racism made laugh good bait Yeah, high risk, unimportant activities. headline... Fauci said.

However... cytokine storm disorder (thought triggered strep scarlet fever childhood), immune response malfunction happens, there's good way (yet) shut faucet. People disorder take immunosupressing drugs target overproduction IL-1, IL-6, IL-18 (types interleukin) fight fatigue, daily fevers, muscles joint pain, rashes, organ failure. drugs stop process immune malfunction--they try block vacuum extra cells. Wait, Canadians fighting Netherlands WW2? Please click read article. Yes, title messed up. Fauci‚Äôs warning real: take years understand long term chronic illnesses young people left with.

I got ‚Äúa flu bug‚Äù child - 25 years ago - never fully got better. It‚Äôs completely redefined trajectory life. CFS terribly named, still poorly understood, least finally recognized serious science real terrible disease.

*No one* take dice roll this. rooting hard ‚Äúlong haulers‚Äù prolonged eventual recoveries. upsetting think getting better. know exactly looks like. Trump Republicans: ‚ÄúSoooo... working intended?‚Äù Fuck, I'm old week! everyone wore n95s correctly 2 weeks, virus would likely gone. happen, least, want protect could. Testing unfortunately limited value right uncontrolled spread seeing. actually probably sadly correct assuming people even quarantine testing positive. America, time defense. N95+ eye protection defense aside true distancing encouraging inaction something someone might do. helping? ORLY? War lost ? look could high youre breath..

I dont think normally can.

So thats amazing.

Side note, add topic, wear mask work every day, hot, dusty, cramped trailers, running ass off, never issues.

The issues start take mask breath lung full dust. dont stop coughing days minimum. Believe potential downsides. Check document published Ontario public health April discussing evidence: scaring much. make public announcement say that:
-only wealthy need wear mask
-or men penises greater 4‚Äù need wear mask I'm real hard time mad people ""regret wearing mask"" minimize pandemic someone know come it. Actually pretty standard American thing do. Skirt lines play dumb people get angry you....and I'm pretty sure Karen invented this. whole reason didn‚Äôt choose full lockdown Swedish CDC thought virus isn‚Äôt going disappear society shuts infection rates lowered enough. countries started opening weeks/months lockdown, technically decided try Swedish approach open businesses, schools gyms imposed rules social distancing, infection rates starts going governments decides lock don‚Äôt think people would stand second time. might evil cycle repeats there‚Äôs vaccine knows happen. show us fox news said children cannot spread virus? saying wear mask conscious ends course day . usually happens street vendors . 

You ask wear mask properly u approach distance adjust mask hunch Americans think sunlight heat kill virus outdoors without risk,‚Äù Carlson said, you‚Äôre group, even outside, spread contract virus. ""It's true confined space better protective."" fights punished school, wasn‚Äôt charges filed legal action. You‚Äôre ok someone locked self defense? 14 might impulse control developed enough stop even know difference. kids develop way, treating kid criminal fastest way make criminal. Maybe protests riots triggered outbreaks maybe didn't, fact politicians supported definitely sent message public upholding rules longer necessary -- likely leading lot people get planes, visit bars, host parties home. Yeah, typed nothing  month ago, parents told wait Labor Day visit think we'd pandemic control then.

I went 4th July weekend, taking proper precautions.

That's little faith America right now. rate, might see 2021 2022. Real life super hero. find study proves otherwise. People starting lose fear. LET'S FUCKING GO!  saw comment YouTube yesterday, saying never wear mask infected, also know anyone infected, hoax. CAL/OSHA, California state plan? Mods, characterized better it‚Äôs coming Disease Epidemiologists? lying opened door considered untrustworthy. blame people wanting follow flip flopping lying company. 

Masks form social pressure based control believe in. accept risk pose others wearing mask. anyone convince wear mask without repeating spoon fed talking points would genuinely consider wearing time. 
I first hand experience tells believe. make stronger argument experience + new angle argue from. impossible must use force. 

Its ok, heading towards authoritarianism. asthma something along lines? completely agree. sad, since silly sibling rivalry genuine upset Sweden choosing dangerous herd immunity strategy aside, Danes love Swedes like siblings end day one *wants* closed borders-- closed borders forced happen due situation. 

But yeah, Sweden gets act together brings caseload really *dumb* idea Danes partial reopening. Something many Danish experts warned bad idea, numbers may showing (we can't know sure yet, quite coincidence uptick coincides exactly one might see one cauesd partial reopening Sweden) bad idea.  Color surprised, multiply incident tens thousand every day... Here's went wrong: FLORIDA Yes would, sub rules prevent us wishing covid anyone Ducey press conference yesterday showing graphs stats show AZ capacity yet, says we've even tapped surge beds yet. sending AZ residents NM? 

""It unclear many patients transferred Arizona New Mexico, out-of-state patients states. Out-of-state patients added state‚Äôs case count, included hospitalization numbers. ""

Or folks even AZ residents? Headlines starting get control. Im saying totally support Ducey's handling situation provide interesting data yesterday, cited sources, certainly paints different picture headlines last 1.5 weeks. actually like Disney. Find stimulate imagination.

But WTF corporate!!! COVID-19 flu? it‚Äôs question dishonest. similar thoughts well course today day zero wind cross-breeze, breezing like crazy yesterday. blacks hispanics work front lines? Something like black engineer hispanic manager? get anything priority? Nope, welded inside yet. What‚Äôs answer though? heart believe distance learning remote learning safest adequate way continue minimize risks. However, parents cannot so. happened young would way hotel cleaning mother waiter father could‚Äôve pulled without us eventually homeless. could barely make ends meet minimum wage job income. Since it‚Äôs impossible please everyone, What‚Äôs solution would benefit most?! Might well change White House Propaganda Minister point. I'm guessing BLM Bureau Land Management. staked mean context? messed long term care facilities US too. several dumb governors force facilities take Covid positive patients. Dumbest idea ever considering elderly vulnerable. many deaths result this.  theory emerged University Singapore- prestigious Singaporean University February. study claimed heat humidity (especially humidity) slowed transmission SARS-COV-2 similarly slowed transmission SARS.

For reason humidity part lost masses (they stuck heat part???), hilarious study‚Äôs main hypothesis humidity slowed movement water droplets virys particles exhale.

There evidence disprove theory it‚Äôs irrelevant everyone hot climates developped countries stays AC day. Well, judge tried another option. something supposed anyway. Didn‚Äôt work. TV actually channel that's constantly devoted Covid News 24/7 trouble wearing five-ish hours one day, wear hour. happened went empty corner far away people, took quick breather, put back on. seen people straight remove casually continue speaking people. What‚Äôs point??

I started working wear day, it‚Äôs definitely easier. people takes getting used to. refusal baffles hell me. people act like they‚Äôre strangled death. table saw properly equipped required safeguards reduce likelihood finger contacting blade? Obvious troll, sad people actually think way vent really really rough body. Mental health health. much better ways address child's mental health schools fall. contained pod one two families would allow children actually socialize time together.

Time classroom going utilitarian year. instruction poor attempt prevent backsliding. Schools going fun places socialize. Dr. Fauci president? Probably it‚Äôs overwhelmingly American we‚Äôre busy freaking Texas Florida record, Trump never said Easter. gonna see actual overflow?

We already did. CNN Texas hospital back, talking doctor said three beds open, ten people need them, now. exaggerating, hyperbolic, footage even see open bed. Several hospitals past overflow. 

Heck, speaking seeing it, back NYC getting slammed, corpse handler companies desperate workers paying $70/hour, paid day's wage start day, many people would work one day never come back. That's coming surge states, bodies magically disappear. 

If looking wanting footage bodies, hold breath, privacy laws, heck, even common decency. money works though. Pissed away fucking trillion dollars got nothing it. OSAH sucks always have. Especially fined standing high ladder. FWIW Coronavirus data change endorsed CDC streamline data make combating virus effective: Dude, that's really heartless. kill people (or lett die) retire longer perceived useful society? Like live society worked murders they're done you. kind life purpose churn profit. 

I really hope trolling.  It‚Äôs Flavoraid. summer flu seasons common places? Pathetic Jokes aside, gone guy's credentials work he's done? Alot European countries kinda handled shit many worse deaths per capita US. one things sure matter shit initial response countries virus atleast control now. Yet US one that's major surge cases initial peak situation seems getting much worse. Honestly assuming countries Europe another major outbreak like US probably end much higher deaths per capita. Deaths already seem increasing again. best US hope surge cases spread states like NY NJ virus control Teachers need time make child care plans sent back s/ Yeah staff walked care centres inadequate protective equipment overwork, call military help out. guesses would benefit reporting covid deaths FL? Anyone? Bueller? true, alot increase seems states texas such, florida/texas high, arizona/california lower. belief needed narrative ‚Äújust like flu‚Äù
Which obviously wasn‚Äôt/isn‚Äôt. Didn‚Äôt answer question. Also, teens allowed assault parents consequences?

But, mom calling cops daughter, can‚Äôt imagine bad teen‚Äôs behavior day day basis. It‚Äôs generally last resort parent can‚Äôt get teen way. Could sign herd immunity? God drowned whole Earth one time. This. like long remember OSHA. chronically understaffed underfunded decades. able investigate claims 10 years ago, I'd genuinely surprised able now. salesman generally make several thousand day employer.

&amp;#x200B;

I get paid chipotle burritos exchange, every day, slap ass 'attaboy. money there. everyone. one would even notice it. Im joking. speaking mind wonderful dear leader Donald Trump many still support, even unemployed. listen actual doctors basically scoff notion say want proud/happy helping people.

US propaganda, basically. Years ago 2016, fired instead coerced quitting, due reporting workplace safety violations (someone previous year suffered serious injury could fatal projectile went slightly different direction).

The coercion instead direct firing able collect unemployment, great job convincing state voluntarily quit. Red meats and, generally, meats high saturated fats. Covid make killing this... Quite relevant: Thanks, experts. Try looking CFIDS/CFS japan suicides went lockdown. forced relax definitely helps people escape stress. good states accurately account death causes. far, states found several hundred deaths inaccurately classified covid, several thousand deaths covid inaccurately classified something else. human interest, investigative piece like journalist *have to* explain accurate accounting covid deaths probably make number higher, since become political football guess someone should.

Personally, make guests pay things. it! Governor Abbott resigned reading comment! Sounds like logical explanation. Australia one federal several state level Chief Medical Officers co-ordinate expert advice frequent public briefings. Thankfully politicians put aside partisanship little we've 100 deaths country 25 million people.

Maybe Biden administration would similarly competent response also hear CDC, Surgeon-General, maybe even Secretary Health people supposed charge? victim blaming. Lots physically different people really abuse survivors shape body affected coping mechanism, key part coping mechanism (a skinny/obese body drives away sexual predators).

You really idea talking about, clue. 

You really question feel need vocal subject bring mental health professional. players effecting Covid situation Trump Fauci, though Trump deplorable, Fauci, well we‚Äôd shut listen we‚Äôd better chance this. 

You must really simple way trying make sense things. I‚Äôll help. Fauci can‚Äôt control governors handle things example. doesn‚Äôt powers demand handle way doesn‚Äôt get tons people killed, even smarter logical immature narcissistic child. governors aren‚Äôt much better POTUS. No, doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúmake deaths fault.‚Äù 30% children tested, 30% children total...those two vastly different things. estimated 10% 20% cases tested all. current daily new cases US probably 350 000 700 000. Well imagine that! surprise. Never million years could anyone predicted April deaths peaked. Yeah.. talks risky stock investments going Vegas, answer real question... How'd do? least he's bare fucking minimum leader guess. want add 80% figure wrong testing capacity hitting real close actual cases. testing increased testing really important. I'm Orlando area teacher. terrifying. feel like I've given weeks live, I'm desperately trying find job work home. lying gaslighting driving insane.

Probably successful person come podunk Kansas town ~500 became NY lawyer currently married doctor. telling people Facebook bad there, tell overblown hoax. I‚Äôm American living Torino.

Conte unified us gave us hope speeches. feel relieved place competent leader throughout mess. even went extra mile middle crisis named Salvini Meloni called nonsense, nothing short legendary. took control situation. 

Trump, hand, can‚Äôt even fucked put mask lead example. shirked responsibility onto individual states. And, unsurprisingly, he‚Äôs source half dissent masks quarantine measures. 

Anecdotally, Facebook filled US friends family questioning masks stating won‚Äôt wear masks. Meanwhile, Italian friends family wearing still‚Äî we‚Äôre enjoying life mostly getting back normal.

Watching happen Italy American crazy. It‚Äôs stark contrast countries many levels.

Personally, get camping much. basically safe vacation. family cancelled trip Jersey Shore camp 1000 Islands summer- camp regular year. stay state, 3 hours home.

Obviously, I'm Canadian happy share become concern due strain puts drug supply. Exactly someone suffers anxiety, insomnia, dizziness, would say pretty concerning.

I stop riding bicycle cause dizziness caused blackouts fainting.

I take medication daily insomnia.

When anxiety bad, get fever, throw up, need take anti anxiety medication.

None mine coronavirus, ot cause those, definitely still life altering.

3. 23727 lives 64 total months

4. growing contagious deadly virus, we're MONTHS THIS. stupid like ""LOL 130,000 died thats big deal"" going stop growing tomorrow something

what gain downplaying seriousness virus? Another victim republican culture would never downvote admit learn mistakes. That's commendable. Thank due diligence. See November. talking lag infection death, they're talking lag deaths occurring reported cdc. last weeks cdc death reporting means complete real value time higher.

Check see week gets revised upwards course next month so. fair, British calling anyone right thing pretty egregious case hipocrasy considering history. They'd corona free report it.

I call 'belt suspenders' method disease prevention. test test tell anyone. Good god, still arguing semantic?

Okay, sure. I'll bite. yesterday, number people died US: 141,118 
Divided 150 days(roughly 5 months)=940.78/day
Now, considering 150 days ago Febuary 18th, would say, yeah, 1k deaths months. trash makes sick. Seeing gloves masks EVERYWHERE.

Lol must feel blessed born land free!  hard tell, tbh. work healthcare experience skewed: family friends take seriously, far I'm aware. one pt come in, however, insisted masks control government cabal, worry bc disappear suddenly election, coronavirus, covid scare tactic. one hundreds insistent, vocal. also many scared leave homes love video visits thing.

To answer question, really depends consider ""average"". drink Trump/Fox News Kool aid loud, still plenty simply dislike inconvenience, take things step ""anything inconveniences affront freedom!"". also strong distrust science, really understand, two attitudes combined honestly terrifying global pandemic thing... ""climate change real"" flat earth believers vocal first place.

It's disheartening, tbh. want believe vocal minority, said: hard tell. Whatever did, people treated European country treats kids way, even something criminal. People also getting tired. lot coworkers went 5 days working home 1 2. fucked idiot ignored social distancing recommendations wear mask.  Praising? like, we're finally seeing positive development shitstorm, people writing articles sharing articles. Congratulations America, number one something! It‚Äôs hard discussion disagreement called names it‚Äôs usually first blow Early pandemic everyone worried contracting virus touching surfaces. still possible seems like main culprit close proximity people. see source outbreaks bars, churches, parties generally indoors. 


In Northern States tend best outside weather May October late July late August time year head indoors heat. Southern States best weather November April May October average 80 degrees higher start peaking summer months. Thus driving everyone indoors.


However, Southern states start experience nice weather Northern states start experience brutal winters drive us back indoors. even though Northern states relatively well right could see resurgence come fall weather drives us indoors flu/cold season picks up.


I honestly see us getting mess either start wearing masks workable treatment high success rate vaccine. combination those. needed mannequins loaded mortuary trucks. /s happens monetize incarceration. Everybody wants turn feeding trough. don‚Äôt either able read it. send screen shots would like. Theres ""no way"" testing enough people find numbers, trust me, getting infections daily. What? Come on, that‚Äôs terrible example. Box truck company logo. Hmmmmm....
You could also pay guy park every night walk away. would come back morning drive around corner, get unseen. city rent, prime locations, price outfitting box truck, paying overnight parking spot, hiring driver hour day. could business setting stealth box trucks major cities.  They're open yet. plans school districts vary greatly. district, they're starting online only. another district, 10 minutes away, using hospital resources, they're going full person. Another district borders one going hybrid. reinforces importance local elections. First all, almost half Dutch population de Randstad Metropolitan area, includes cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam Den Haag, similar densities big cities US.

Secondly, average class size in, Netherlands also high, problem solved partitioning classes smaller classes, smaller classes would go school times per week. Class size something can't change... literally scroll like four inches post find report Spain ~50% patients suffered long lasting neurological symptoms.

You literally need read see wasnt talking ""long lasting"".

What read 57% Covid patients reported neurological symptoms (this includes headaches, dizziness, loss smell). That's hospital&lt;. nothing telling permanent symptoms. got headaches hospitalized Covid fine afterwards would 57%.

[Over half coronavirus patients Spain developed neurological problems, studies neurological spectrum wide,‚Äù says Tom√°s Segura, head neurology University Hospital Albacete, one two medical centers participate paper. **According Segura, co-authored study, common symptoms experienced coronavirus patients myalgia, headaches dizziness.** points nearly 20% also presented disorders consciousness, although symptoms concentrated among elderly patients. Yep. Trump caught virus died COVID-19, would conspiracy theory actually murdered Deep State. fair enough might harsh judgement part family getting one ""for cheap"". might lesson buy barely working one 70s. real research like seem smarter choices made Wow. mistake though. Common sense made think it'd allowed everywhere 12 hours driving means need least 8 hours rest. Wild case every state. FeelsBadMan That's nifty I'm still waiting 30000000 day covid test good ol USA Hostile entities totally misinforming public. misinformation seems relate pandemic created undermine trump presidency. ‚ÄúAll lives matter.‚Äù

‚ÄúPro Life‚Äù

Uh. idiot. course they‚Äôre fake go online buy one lol context legal debate would mention ADHD unless thought mattered? tell height weight too?

Just clear taking something without permission theft. Would like someone take items home without permission. 

The Governor President call National Guard, mother decided call police. live place call emergency number, person gun badge going first responder. People need move place different response mechanism, change dynamic politically, call police want police.

The mother involved member community, teacher, religious leader, Girl Scout leader, neighbor, friend, aunt, uncle, cousin, librarian, social worker......

Probation absolutely works signed court order. Defendant acknowledges, minor also involves parent. back poor lady, taken responsibility child sad see juvy, perhaps ounce prevention would better pound cure found family in.

I second hand experience many people convicted misdemeanors felonies. Probation, although never fun, almost always better incarceration. 

What would rather do? Homework Juvy? even debate. countries barely get along keep helping Democrats Bill Gates perpetrate hoax!?!?  


/s idea biggest mistake pandemic. 500k dead people after. That‚Äôs US video saying replayed countless times argument loones Hanging friends beach... welp that‚Äôs lie Get buck get buck, get buck get buck get buck! Buckle up, time cases ever recorded daily, far greater majority people either denial, scared, bored, sick all. rich fucks decided money worth lives. people beed charged terrorism. knowingly placing others danger stoking growing fear-based conflict eventually lead widespread violence. Yeah guess social distancing recommendations remains. 

But honest sounds like fact seeing upswing typical tourist destination Sweden casuaing debate weather least part attributed growing immunity... guess time tell. No, that's true along. recorded death rate estimated 10% actual death rate, 90% cases tested. means virus deadly far contagious, way worse less contagious virus deadlier (like Ebola, example). confirmed cases US 3.3 mln actual people contracted virus estimated 20 30 mln. still way less 330 mln population. goes countries - estimated France 6% population Covid, recorded cases far lower.

Specifically US, deaths dramatically increase cases dramatically increased - guys catching 20K cases per day month ago, means 100 200K actual cases, led 1000 deaths per day. catching 70K now, that's 350-700K actual, means 3000 deaths daily (and even system overloads). rough calculations, course. says ignore science quotes scientific studies support opening schools? 
Very cherry picked suspect scientific studies course... Looking forward exact level competence deadly pandemic inevitably hits. Grocery shopping hungry always rife bad decisions. They‚Äôre probably getting orders ignore COVID boss shares 80% RNA sars. yeah, pretty close sars. also better adaptation/immune cloaking/infectivity sars successful. Never said (I used manage pizza delivery company), observing jobs posted thousands us unemployed Austin can't deliver pizza. us afford rent/bills food delivery salary. little smaller lot peaceful ones turned riots Imagine telling someone exact headline year ago. It‚Äôs health safety children, schools already major vector seasonal flu every parent knows kids regularly bring diseases home school them. dangerous whole country. stupid man becomes viral stupid booing him? He's right.

This guy showed crowd thinking wearing masks consequence might literally death. let's hope enough stupid people die ""freedom"" tips vote get Trump out. Americans acting like widespread infection inevitable yet also hoax, refusing bare minimum (wear effing mask public), demanding businesses open up, acting nonchalant people dying hallways hospitals ICU beds capacity.

In working class, mix learned helplessness fear. Regarding whether hoax inevitable, really know believe believe effect anyone else. especially want get back shit jobs, want evicted starve, getting back work least misery know. control life used control, thing want miserable thing get with‚Äî used chance preventing it.

In higher social classes, plain entitlement. people care many people die long stock portfolios OK. takes one damage know marines thought article said 103k tests conducted?

Edit: I‚Äôm match I‚Äôve seen multiple Florida news outlets post...103k new tests...11,500 positive. 11.5 percent positive rate. Yeah, take rest money evict us billionaire gods get cheap investment properties. make us send kids school get sick make buck. Revolution time? Wrong.

1. Companies still laying people hundreds, meanwhile 10 job openings day doesnt come close millions unemployment.

2. great lost benefits insurance. pay like double health insurance now.

3. There's pandemic raging control, people staying home good thing.

4. money often times goes back economy. I‚Äôm talking physically building. I‚Äôm talking raising child. People want automatically blame schools teachers first way person becomes reality people think parents doesn‚Äôt take much putting mask stop exponential growth 

What hell states like Florida, Texas Arizona done lead believe people magically start wearing masks soon. building fire. landlord tells fine safely evacuate cares most. realize fire engulfed house landlord lying. changes course people safely house house engulfed fire. even personally admits lied camera.

What do? reddit, celebrate landlord pay tributes him.

""Oh Trump...."" Trump human trash save ""but Trump"" diatribe.

Some us knew believe Fauci, mainstream western media, sheep reddit early crises. paid attention science warnings coming China, Taiwan, South Korea.

My company closed offices day Fauci advising people safe go cruises. HR team better sense him. Forgive putting crown man. far concerned lucky still job. Great username btw! cracks up. I'm gonna start calling US North American Brazil. We're large, charge incredibly dysfunctional. Data valuable. testing ‚Äútheory‚Äú lives stake inane logic. rhetoric touted schools need open economy. Newsflah, pandemic. disease still confounds doctors researchers. Maybe people willing sacrifice children, well caretakers educators, find cost one life high prove wrong. Considering we‚Äôve seen respect long antibodies seem last attitudes vaccine even existence virus country, vaccine never viable solution end disaster US. vaccine 60-70% effective you‚Äôd still need nearly 100% population receive order achieve herd immunity. 30-50% population simply won‚Äôt get vaccinated, possibly ever, means need nearly 100% effective vaccine even shot herd immunity, that‚Äôs pretty big ask. 

So yeah, need treatment we‚Äôre going get control. Maybe generations cousin marriage good something all? Like what? know: lot us angry average Texan.. even average American. Many us adhering social distancing guidance wearing masks, washing sanitizing hands surfaces general *trying* keep spread low.

Most us *are* angry complete ineptitude lack human decency governments seem showing citizens. portrayed state federal government behaved? become quite obvious many us see Americans expendable resource people.

Please stay safe can. know that's easy live state government seems fail citizens every turn. &lt;3 Seriously, little one? weep creativity youth. awful. feel like got video game. must bullied mercilessly. know attempt insult cry help. 

Serious question, bed-wetter? there's shame that's case, made side-bet girlfriend. great question. According Cali Dept Public Health's guidance use face coverings (06/18/20), exempt wearing mask: ""Persons engaged outdoor work recreation swimming, walking, hiking, bicycling, running, alone household members, able maintain distance least six feet others."" HOWEVER, written guidance MB expects. nearby cities, seems masks required times public regardless distance activity. city requirements apparently none widely published. I'd love comment instantly attacked refuted folks published mask requirements south bay LA cities. Thank posting that. brought tear eye reading it. suffered lot NJ. however implying occurrence causes lose immunity quickly likely isn‚Äôt true new reports lately. Spain, change anything letter  say invalid. first reply response attributing outcomes completely interventions, studies pointing young kids spreading less that.

I concerned 'false sense security' discussing here. definitely subreddit frequented people prone that. explicitly discussing science, busy worrying someone might spin data go all-in one conclusion try suppress data points.

The reality studies hear yet peer reviewed replicated. small sample size. take time get fleshed out. 

Of course, none matters many states complete shit-show. Schools reasonable option there. Massachusetts though, handle schools bit complicated. agree part feels still rebuttal denial Yeah, college football fall total pipe dream. I'm required stop red lights sober drive public roads.

There's 'right' endanger others. natural rights *at all*, existing rights created law. law exist make prosperous society possible, protect sociopaths care others. Lol chance. Sort shit People unnecessarily concerned people making much unemployment people making significantly less unemployment? I'm much lower middle class max unemployment state would pay 50% regular salary. 

If want people making ""too much,"" could least compensate everyone regular salary. Otherwise, houses, cars everything else go unpaid. funny thing is, can't imagine that's good economy. They're completely blinded hate. read thing linked to? That's scientific study, pseudoscience ""commentary"" someone looking numbers unrelated studies pulling conclusions asses. Hell, that.       
   
Looked first example used, study says this:   
""This study limitations. study sample likely represent total number pediatric SARS-CoV-2 cases time period. Indeed, patients milder atypical presentation might sought medical attention. ""   
   
Yeah, shit.   
Also, there's certainty infection routes study report 8% infected children still. infected adults says nothing contagion children, that's works. That's like saying bottles rarely contain water counting random shelf coke.         
If going produce bullshit conclusion, maybe studies referred study children sudden magically would stop able spread diseases/viruses instead? step 1 making conclusion like this? they'd able pull they'd get nobel price, that's groundbreaking earthshaking science. Might hold key eliminating contagious diseases forever, digress.       
     
In mean while, every time disease goes certain kindergardens whole work place turns ghost town parents get infected bring diseases work. Infected children, infected children. noOoOo, virus. virus special children shield, here's 4 studies guesstimate many children got infected adults. studying anything though, counting something else comparing. would need scientific studies pseudoscience? needs PhD medicine need PhD bullshit. incorrect understand it. screening sniff done mobile dog good sense smell, like beagle. first screening passes second test done dog perfect sense smell: basset hound. look day death ignore last 10 days though probably nowhere near completely yet. curve heading right direction though. 

This page shows quite clear, although ""forecast"" really forecast. ...the title link? It‚Äôs orange medal gold one. get win!

And get win!

Everybody gets win!!! don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really accurate. dogs work absolutely scale training. There‚Äôs shortage dogs. we‚Äôre dealing huge global crisis. Lol well first all, anyone thinks flu doesn‚Äôt exist summer probably shouldn‚Äôt taken seriously comes intelligence type stuff :) Hover text ""First prize free ticket kissing booth"". frustrating! tried nothing it‚Äôs working. focusing wrong thing.

But need. problem plan allow fact virus would spiral control everywhere once. 

Now I'm hearing need 3 4 million tests day. can't imagine well versed literature. question becomes advise home made masks? think virtually public health agencies around world advise everyone wear homemade masks?

Aggressive anti-maskers need publicly named shamed. Contact employers, get fired, burst entitlement bubble.

The United States unique position right - corporations responding public pressure bad behaviour part employees (racism, anti-mask tantrums). Make assholes pay public displays ignorance losing job. Eventually, might start stop people publicly spreading anti-mask lies would even read insignificant morons opinion piece anyways? He‚Äôs even good trade rep, let alone fucking medical expert. Every person administration plucked bottom barrel. Literally worst people country offer. don‚Äôt even try. spend time bitching moaning good American people. Quite pathetic. guess people refusing vaccinate vaccine becomes available? Trump wants give appearance everything fine go spend money Disney world target. ? economy rebounds use chip get re-elected November

300 million people fed virus fucking senile 70 year old win presidency again. don‚Äôt understand we‚Äôre accepting fate built black scar earth commemorate Vietnam, it‚Äôs price getting haircut. may still extent many people catching indoors air conditioned spaces? first assumption. Anxiety meds haven‚Äôt helped yet. job, I'm 30+ feet ground hanging concrete heavy winds platform. harness anything. guy fall side it, die. (Severely f'd rest list, lived.) 

I hear OSHA stopping strip. :/ There's inconvenience wearing mask. Everything.

Everything went wrong. Agreed people exaggerating implications studies safety level confidence. may also legitimate interpretations supports opening schools places virus decently control. US polarized right seems like people feel need one side 100%. pay attention idiots. health maybe life, life beloved ones might line. strong think right take measures protect yourself. 

I'm similar situation here. months working home, forced back offices days per week, coworkers mostly playing risk following rules distance, masks avoiding gatherings enclosed spaces. crazy cases spiking again, many people given say catch point. I'm lot pressure want join gatherings go lunch. difficult none us wants excluded group, see labelled asocial paranoic knows, made decision avoid want cry later think possible avoid catching disease dumb scared going flow. Ok, exposure opportunities cumulative. Sure, chance spreading infection one exposure infected child might lower, kids one classroom 8 hours day close proximity family rest time rolling dice day eventually hit natural 1.

Even 1/4 chance infection compared adults makes normal in-person schooling terrible idea cases spiking country. lot eu schools open, healthcare experts saying ""we seen cases kids infected parents, always parents infecting kids.""

I dont know believe netherlands kids till 18 dont social distance eachother seems since schools opend (kid)infections. 

Ofc schools opened peak guys still climbing peak wave 1. What's point mentioning total population we're discussing density. Total population influence fast virus spreads, many people could get infected. 

The entirety Netherlands average 24 students one classroom (elementary school), high considering every village surrounds big cities elementary school. villages thousand inhabitants schools relatively empty. , Randstad average even higher.

If could bring kids back school relatively safe manner, guys. excuses. idiot read joint report Feb 28 I'm seeing anything separating families. I'm also sure exactly referring to. elaborate think recommending compared actually are? cool Germany do! I'm really glad hear that. bet got back. :) friend nurse sick loss taste smell, horrible aches, fatigue, etc. tested negative. Twice.  Climate change denial laid groundwork assault American rights. Nice going boys, playing yesterday's tape Misleading, refers hospital admissions overall cases. can't people honest, need play numbers scare people? wonder many Uighurs ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù lockdown. Fuck it, lets re-open Schools see makes difference. oh sure, 5 different antibody studies conducted NYC estimated 2-2.5M real infections.

And need remember 1M people NJ CT also caught NYC, thus making part outbreak.

So around 3M infections 48k deaths whole NYC metropolis outbreak. after.... Governor need beg Federal Assistance/Bailout (assuming Trump good mood RNC nomination party), state go bankrupt eminent shutdown (during lucrative tourism High Season) get shit control hopefully make viable place tourism again... state heavily relies tourism collect state income tax... Problem Nevada also rising infection/hospitalization rate. anti-vaxxers, majority privileged white people, taking advantage that. Disgusting. good measure, I'm Dutch highschool around 3500 students total. timetable system used, would 6-8 different courses day individual student would specific timetable. cousins still go now. classes somehow partitioned student go school 1-2 days week. students would stay classroom day, teachers subbed out. Obviously, system flawless student would sit classes courses take, much better school definitely lot safer opening school fully. think agree schools opened fully immediately, since happened either. I'm trying show situation much different US important look nuance handled this, US media definitely lacking far tell. guess I'm trying tell end fully opening schools bad, mean opening option stop hating stop electing people like Ted Cruz Donald Trump.

Deal? bright side die maybe second wave won‚Äôt bad since left smart people what? Another season? happens spring you‚Äôre football basketball, 90% universities resources stretched nothing, keep employees employed Ofcourse. 

Just much pipe dream want football spring want fall. died putting Americans danger. Fuck guy, parasite unfortunate wasnt aborted. Treating social problems things criminalized working great anyone society for-profit prison system.

Kid homework, maybe get better academic resources, tutors, counselors? guarantee putting behind bars going get hit books anymore definitely going improve trajectory life.  No. society decided value athletes more. unamerican, infringements freedommmmmm /s also assuming current deaths, iirc can't actually say death certificate done testing/hospitals bad shape imagine paperwork exactly priority one.   ""Despite White House document encouraging states, specifically red zone, slow pull back reopening plans, President Donald Trump pushed states continue reopening.""

Things continue get worse mixed messages. Probably ppl know effectiveness different types masks tbh dealing wife type1? Mine well I'm finding difficult. Well I'm already wearing mask social distancing Dr. Fauci, want? means Republican voters. wonder want COVID diffuse thoroughly possible.  short answer surfaces unlikely cause infections, way surface-lead infections theoretically possible infectious person cough surface, come along short time later (1-2 hours), touched surface immediately put finger mouth. See paper below.

1. infectious person probably lot virus hands unless coughed it. spot touched could contain virus. virus cannot move expand cover wall.
2. sick person cannot contaminate surface clean hands. Even infectious, washed hands, everything touch remain clean. may tiny bit transfer person speak near surface breath heavily amount would near impossible enough infect anyone else even licked it.
3. Yes fine. get infected breathing close wearing masks, can't get infected handshake. Even touched mouth afterward unlikely result infection.
4. cannot get infected genitalia. virus enter body ACE2 receptors, present skin. nose mouths receptors recommended avoid touching face hands may contaminated, practice nose mouth receptors, even get virus likely get cells infect you. lungs HUGE number ACE2 receptors, inhaled sick person's droplets, chances much higher one virus find receptor successfully infect "" opinion, chance transmission inanimate surfaces small, instances infected person coughs sneezes surface, someone else touches surface soon cough sneeze (within 1‚Äì2 h). disagree erring side caution, go extremes justified data. Although periodically disinfecting surfaces use gloves reasonable precautions especially hospitals, believe fomites contact infected carrier many hours pose measurable risk transmission non-hospital settings. balanced perspective needed curb excesses become counterproductive. "" opinion piece, backed evidence review article: ""There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature. "" go describe possible cases, nothing surface definitely culprit. Now, surface lead transmission really hard track, reasonably common seen least one confirmed case now. also couple hospital researches swabbed surface around positive patients, found viral material, failed grow viable virus lab. California closing Arizona border yet? Fucking vultures. something learned school....and literally watching eyes....and nobody cares. point, really isnt anyone else blame ourselves. thing prevent corruption strong culture unified it. we're stupid know NEVER happen. Happens way place. sham! look virus handled.zero fucks given, OSHA? There‚Äôs several people work gotten sick, nothing done, mask there...but business usual. Trump ushered era reverse (sort of) regulatory capture. Instead agencies slowly capturing regulators, agency heads still part former industry melded them, making regulators impotent. Experts estimate tens millions Americans contracted coronavirus included official tallies testing errors, misdiagnoses, sluggish public health response, ignorance disease early days United States.

Holy fuck. scary part all. functionally flying blind bad was, bad continues be. truly fucking clue many people shit. subreddit attempting remove politics discussion fucking farce.

Sorry mods, one side politicized pandemic they're stopping. Trying ignore dishonest denying reality anti-maskers. Grow snowflake Well yah, I'm public health professional. leave analysis colleagues. don‚Äôt care guess bet HHS follow great example invent new ones! lack care. purposeful malevolence. Lack care would line wearing mask letting fall immediately putting back on.

Intentions important. one thing ignorant, entirely different thing try force ignorance others. intent purpose. keep mind 2,100 inspectors entire country 130 million workers 8 million locations. easy feels good blame say care stretched **extremely** thin. Utterly insane. 

Social distancing masks. That's fucking takes. That's Canada we're back 80% normal life. 

And boils Donald fucking Trump wanting wear mask public. had, start, know followers would militantly pro-mask spike could almost entirely avoided. 

Donald Trump's concern looks TV pictures going literally death untold thousands Americans.  context legal debate would mention ADHD unless thought mattered? 

I would legal debate sending child jail their, funnily enough actual context OP. know, right?

If drive crowd car discovered brake line cut, would use defence charges manslaughter?

Will lead example, clear taking something without permission theft. Would like someone take items home without permission.

Again, never said Governor President call National Guard, mother decided call police. 

Did she? then? live place call emergency number, person gun badge going first responder. 

This child sent prison school homework, need move place different response mechanism, change dynamic politically, call police want police.

Good lord! nobody let's run country. must maddening nobody ever listens mother involved member community, teacher, religious leader, Girl Scout leader, neighbor, friend, aunt, uncle, cousin, librarian, social worker......

You mean teacher set remote classes child? friend took child respite mother?

Gosh, know much. charge. Guess we'll never Probation absolutely works signed court order. Defendant acknowledges, minor also involves parent. back poor lady, taken responsibility child sad see juvy, perhaps ounce prevention would better pound cure found family in.

You send thesis Oakland authorities. somebody like second hand experience many people convicted misdemeanors felonies. Probation, although never fun, almost always better incarceration.

She probation. Says article. I'll person supposed read flogged, m' would rather do? Homework Juvy? even debate.

And yet, are....

Now go. Say funny stuff. Go on. You. go. Make jokes.... American really want America well, place sucks is, riots, gun violence, fast food cheap, healthy food expensive, public schools suck, almost everyone's stupid tell dick stick ground. People way selfish, racist, stupid rude. Yeah get guns? guess creates problems. conclusion America sucks. Thanks coming Ted talk. That‚Äôs think! Kids weren‚Äôt infected kids weren‚Äôt going anywhere! So, giving opportunity? 

Now school sports activities allowed resume area, teens ‚Äòmysteriously‚Äô starting test positive! Duh! Ohioan here. I‚Äôm missing lung lobes blood clots. husband heart issues. went local hardware store toilet valve. 2 cashiers masked excited hug-and-kiss clinch bare faced visitor who‚Äôd apparently flown Florida couldn‚Äôt wait work see them. used self-serve (politely) told need immediately wash hands faces change masks. appreciate advice. Let's assume Swedish outcome would strict lockdown similar neighbors.

Why might true, America gets pummeled? guess, based data, obesity multi-generational households. 

It altogether possible virus going roll country pleases, strict lockdown delays inevitable. true, best response avoid local/regional spikes overwhelm health systems, lock elderly obese. That's lot easier countries like Sweden nearly many obese people. overlay average IQ areas US.... concubine ? It‚Äôs marshmallow test writ large. ‚ÄúCan patient short amount time get reward?‚Äù notable fraction American test takers ate marshmallow immediately making eye contact test giver, demanded whole bag marshmallows.  Probably overwhelming number complaints. parents republican hell even disappointed people complaining wear mask half measures attempts contain spread. fox news watch amazed agree subject. say none us understanding situation, owners abused that. also regularly committed fraud (telling mark ""extra"" heavy items counting errors damaged products could get money corporate without send anything proof). two close friends rely franchise income I'd report them.

Though one time try report (for, opening new store, lying fire commissioner whether conducting business without license, telling us same, continuing sell shit half-finished building) corporate guy got like ""well Ron nice guy can't see something like that"" refused shit.

But experience OSHA fact asshole owner knew name address also want get clear federal agencies problem letting someone unstable know one reported them.  News coverage huge problem. many reporting numbers social media posts. I'm stocked little real reporting been. bit better lately verse March, dont understand seeing grim images news constantly. covered New York better, maybe states wasted prep time implemented better protocols.

... still though dont see much great reporting. Finally saw Houston vid day conditions, course smuggled hospital posted Twitter. news orgs need stepping show real story. know numbers accurate due process, mistakes, non-testing, intentional manipulation. stop showing total infected/death numbers. Focus showing GD front lines; hospitals, ER traffic, food banks, closed businesses, test sites.. etc. sounds like state could contracting lab right busy I'm Kansas. single thing **can't** right now. orders nothing. got shut everything down. Like real, half ass shit again. actually enforce it. That's key. 

You saw masks jump ~5% people 80% days recent mask order. almost everywhere back 50% best. lot people putting t-shirt face run gas station. see places like grocery stores got coverage early. something like QuikTrip thousands people day go see nothing lot people. 

Unfortunately, job social place, outdoors. upwards 10,000 patrons day coming through, maybe see 20-30 masks day social distancing.

I'm pickle right now, feel safe, everyone handling this, I'm 98% sure lose job take time off. Yeah, talking family member last night telling friends moved Northeast, planning moving back home. Basically, point pandemic really exposed neighbors are. Even true it‚Äôs hypocritical. American companies asia ‚ÄúWent viral‚Äù indeed. They‚Äôre sending hospital patients New Mexico though, get waaaay underwater financially. Tpo roofing #1 deal breaker now. cost like $300-$500 replace day. interior stays dry gets used things tend break. #naturalselection reached 25% NY/NJ yet? let alone 50% 75% (Deaths / Million) 

FL 15% NY/NJ (or NY/NJ 6x higher)

TX 7% NY/NJ (or NY/NJ 14x higher)

We even talking order magnitude nothing value lost. deserved this. trying find polite name ""fucking dumb, clueless, ignorance, racist, cunt"". Help out. see irritated here?

The post specifically clear Fauci pocket big pharma benefiting financially promoting vaccines way could benefiting promoting new patented medicines. 

I happen agree system work is. *is* system moment. governments researching creating drugs used population sold cost others. money. need corporations make them.

In capitalism, job business make money. That's it. Pharma businesses make drugs make money, goal money. what's magical age consent covid wait for? ask ID? Perhaps instinctively knows? Could charged corruption minor lie age? may lose lot go around infecting people asked nothing. comment removed talking politics literally political post, missing here? Stop censoring people. said, go listen press conference see say this. media pretty obviously twisted one guys. OSHA? busy busting small time construction guys beer lunch care major companies to. get sick often adults still become significant spreaders. like lot friends, didn‚Äôt feel need wear mask young healthy,‚Äù Conley wrote post, shared three days Rose's death.

Nah dude fucked went around without mask spreading deadly virus bought fox news anti-science idiots told covid hoax carry nothing happening. hate think many people exposed. really get choose? would know? Excluding California parts florida, states worst outbreaks wearing masks. one hard understand: (not peer reviewed study, commentary) Christ, UK *country* topped 6,000 cases per day, 3 times population Florida ... locked entire country down.

Florida going hellish place couple weeks, considering full lockdown all? one reason First Past Post voting must die. think MAGA hats are? bunch patients abandoned staff several facilities, right? 

A lot care homes privatized, many workers part-time. work multiple facilities get equivalent full-time hours.

With outbreak risk spread stopped working multiple facilities. choose...and large chose stop working facilities good, made problem worse places. workers also quit altogether think safe since PPE short supply, ridiculously overworked staff shortages pay pretty poor. probably towards young extroverted people like go lot party he's talking wonder shutdown before, after, Republican convention ? I‚Äôm telling you, working NCAA D1 admin spot, it‚Äôs not. physically staff pull off.

We‚Äôve ran countless models. Sometimes feel like CDC IRL Internet Explorer. World says masks good, takes CDC 2-3 months say masks ""may"" good idea. Cuomo saying virus came Europe since May(I think), CDC confirms July. feeling bit better, still cleared work yet sick pay gone. That‚Äôs true too, there‚Äôs lot political pressure approve anything looks like won‚Äôt harmful virus excuse ‚Äúreopen economy,‚Äù whatever that‚Äôs supposed actually mean. guess refer vaccine mean one properly tested proven effective. don‚Äôt know much apartment landlord scene works,

LOL! actually follow plan, here's go. get mortgage complex, buy it, almost immediately go default. property foreclosed bank, bank eventually sell loss, sue recover lost, meaning lose house, too.

You idea world works. bullshit. story government wants. Multiple studies coming conclusion children transmit COVID. got numb sirens going time. hope never spikes again. Arizona one needs purple af. it‚Äôs light unfortunately That's think sunbelt outbreaks happening now.

Further north Europe rest US we're spending time outside, Texas Arizona Florida everybody retreats inside heat.  Thats happens share political views power. Osha always reactionary organization. Seeing US already 138,000 deaths even lockdown, 180,000 sound like much worse we're already at. saying Sweden's method failures maybe would beneficial society allow virus spread obtain herd immunity. know ‚Äúacting bad faith‚Äù means? completely disagree analysis that. also disagree Fauci overall ‚Äúbad‚Äù track record virus overall. He‚Äôs operating within context admin denies science, promotes ignorance, actively worked play scope necessary response pandemic very, late. Acting like sort unilateral operating freedom silly.

So you‚Äôre eager overrate impact mistakes (which people admit mistakes), wonder you‚Äôre Trump apologist contrarian. keep saying we‚Äôre going mental health pandemic viral one healthcare people. videos I‚Äôve seen devastation patients dying alone, PTSD damn near inevitable. wasn‚Äôt guard blade, hit leading edge? people coping mechanism negative. surround news new cases easy get depressed, follow news vaccine research made quite hopeful. guy, expert, saying need stay ready case deal another pandemic future. That's much productive realistic thinking we'll dealing specifically Covid 19 entire lives. important focus current situation, also important think beyond it. pandemic last forever, try caught unprepared either. Abolish OSHA put new organization place. Hmm, almost like Capitalism issue needs rejected violence uses project itself. Exactly right. Compliance key; either violence shame. won't. lockdown protests pretty small number people compared many people going restaurants, hanging friends/family, travelling, going gym, etc raise money NHS, raised money charities associated NHS. ‚ÄúUntil notice‚Äù Imagine one top 50 cited researchers *in world*, someone field says, ""... yeah... lets listen him"". actual insanity. claimed anything specific. comparing states small countries according valid entire US. States strategies like EU countries, comparable populations. Definitely feel environmental protection agency. see Flint, MI still clean water issues, oil spills, oceanic garbage islands, improperly stored nuclear waste leaking soil ocean...It‚Äôs crazy huge budget seemingly sitting hands. see stoners r/trees picking trash environment weed budget...maybe Doritos too.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Like researchers complains OSHA? scares me. I'm best stay away people limit store grocery shopping. small town provide curbside. Sucks going one idiots ends killing me. I'm really high risk.

 buddy active covid-19 symptoms he's telling Court wants appear person traffic ticket versus phone appearance. He's got bad symptoms says. Funny Court wants go governor's directive, State public health county health feel safe though.

 Hope get sick.

Lunacy every turn man.

Stay safe read linked article basically testimonials people numbers. Saying freezer truck morgues showing different things people. us safe cautious since March dont need visuals, suspect lot others do. course still people dont get hits them, I'm sure could ever provide evidence would resonate them.  career mess ever since. ""The incident led current situation happened Nov. 6, someone called police hearing Charisse crying ‚ÄúHelp me!‚Äù honking car‚Äôs horn. Grace, upset couldn‚Äôt go friend‚Äôs house, reached inside car try get mother‚Äôs phone bitten mother‚Äôs finger pulled hair, according police report.""
Weeks later, picked another charge, larceny, caught surveillance video stealing another student‚Äôs cellphone school locker room.


If article correct, jailed homework, jailed assault, theft. get jail card... homework. didn't.......................
I think jail time (or time detention house) necessarily appropriate, think 15 year old violated social norms like face sort consequences. idea home sentenced live positive influence life, though doubtful.... Unfortunately, US done good job building institutions help people kind problems. Hopefully recent debates lead better support system troubled teens....... big issue schools going face kids spend large amount time close proximity one another closed environment circulated air (the easiest environment spread covid in).

We're going trust kids break rules staying away other, wearing masks applicable (should everywhere, know happen), also sick first place.

Even show respiratory symptoms, mean breath virus-free. Dental cleaning Tinder Date...

Hue hue hue need show fucking body bags trucks filled dead bodies. need show America harm virus causing. always think fake need get normal people realize serious. still don‚Äôt even understand point dancing around conclusion without supporting anyway. 

Saying ‚Äúif could it. excuses‚Äù makes zero sense it‚Äôs apples apples comparison you‚Äôre making false equivalence chance. specifically said another lockdown, rather governor has. well, can't speak Italy real knowledge, imagine trust government tanked 2008 crisis whole PIIGS drama. least Greece, became clear rule law irrelevant pertained elites, banks, IMF.... austerity people, stimulus rich. 

Distrust government worldwide, large part 2008 crash. 

I'd love see someone plot correlation rate covid spread trust/distrust government. surprised find trust government high, rate covid spread lower. distrust high, rate spread higher. See blame much. nurses like get hospital ordinary people vary little way medical training knowledge, mostly know give elderly pills clean *accident* (that true care homes grandparents wife's grandmother anyway) probably cpr training would extent it

Suddenly asking people like deal highly infections disease knowledge fight without giving correct PPE equipment meaning might risking lives big ask. cute, means propagating need China tell what's going on, China highest manufacturing sector world. easily see what's happening watching supply chains commerce coming country. 

In January/February/March huge decline ports, electronic availability, raw materials. Since April slowly got back normal. 

Not saying areas issues say downright lying trying speculate anywhere near problem like us make sense economic standpoint. saw Pornhub Obviously anecdotal, know guy COVID-19 symptoms, got tested test came back negative. symptoms continued get worse go hospital point tested came back positive. 

His first test almost certainly false negative. doubt experienced uncommon. Hey, fuck you. went fucked girl, rightfully go jail pedophia. child. purpose juvenile system rehabilitate children, mess further. Sticking child jail writing homework pandemic definitely rehabilitate them.  title true also misleading, since article even points Alberta 12x worse Canada overall, i.e. 3x worse NY example. yes, every individual state worse Canada total, Canadian provinces. fifteen, medical condition makes unstructured learning difficult best circumstances. Maybe instead throwing detention center, could evaluated needs made sure getting support needs successful. say ""that's life works"", exactly supposed work US schools. medicated? provided synchronous learning opportunities (which tend engaging easier people ADHD stay focused on)?

Edit: oh look, article discusses IEP, initially getting support needed school, time went court, special education teacher said plan better. special ed teacher able testify class teach. hospitalizations number new hospitalizations? 366 people admitted hospital result COVID infection? largest one. know many others are, sorry. article Florida paper, Florida. regulatory body nearly 30 states, OSHA passes responsibility state agencies. Health Department, provides ‚Äúsurveillance work-related injuries‚Äù shares findings, Florida agency. ‚ÄúFlorida state OSHA program would able set inspections enforce emergency standards,‚Äù Michaels said. ‚ÄúThey power make employers protect employees.‚Äù ""Years ago 2016"", golly-bum, 4 years really feel like eternity. people make news. Many people helping others even aren‚Äôt healthcare essential workers - getting groceries, errands, cooking, etc. course OSHA virtually non-existent.

This voting vote deregulation. one things--you also voting pollution.

Dangerous workplaces + pollution = profits. anyone owner big business would vote somewhat mystery. I've given much thought concluded idiots. get leniency due age, 15 years old! beyond time know right wrong. told Judge stay jail online class work, yet failed it, especially important Judge stick his/her decision. consequences actions wound front Judge willing show leniency providing follows rules. (Which really designed help future). didn‚Äôt leniency removed.  sympathy here!  Bad parenting maybe got here, bad choices got judge, another bad choice landed jail.   problem?  Also, continues bad things life, people would yelling- systems fault let jail! jail given leniency!  winners here. No, common sense outlook and, IMHO, it. Jail! That‚Äôs exactly people suggesting basis abstract despite fact readers sub lack scientific literacy understand said. seem understand means also recognize article doesn‚Äôt reveal anything promising new wrt know virus. We‚Äôve known months there‚Äôs activation CD4+ CD8+ cells idea kind protection confer, any. Context:

Indian cases rising fast, they're track becoming next Brazil/US soon. despite this, EU countries somehow decided would good idea restart flights, even though hardly-hit countries facing similar situation obviously still no-no? like leaders want second european wave happen. reap sow....

To judgmentally speak compassion... compassion anyone else, certainly would put narcissistic need attention aside potentially passed death pain others. It‚Äôs perfectly doable spring dude Fayetteville tried month ago. Glad rest state finally onboard could tube shoved throat ventilate them. uncle helped raise niece bunch nephews, definitely tell kids sure spread pretty much every disease catch (I clobbered many times bugs). hell would anyone expect different covid-19? level stupidity lead US becoming epicenter. case anybody ever wondering.. 75 year old high risk person told ""people tired locked up"" story bars news. Exactly. critical actions lead person's death without critical person themselves. 

When mom died drinking death lots talk alcoholism taken young even thought setting charitable donation thing funeral. also talked wonderful person was. 

In man's case family still talk knew wonderful person still spread news dangers believing public health officials pandemic people wear masks. ‚ÄúI turn car around kids don‚Äôt stop going businesses opened!‚Äù report concedes, however, much evidence ‚Äúis low quality‚Äù due speed gathered 

Looks like another clickbait article me. report based ""low quality"" data pretty much worthless. summary work Dutch medical authorities research consulted. conclude (primary-school) children infect people, infection rate small - certainly far less 25%. one contact-tracing study managed identify 693 routes, couple children aged 10 under. likely. symptoms? SOB consistent, come go?

You might want see get antibody test too, though know issues accuracy there. election year, really doubt going choice. ignore delay anything surge, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll able recover time re-election. OSHA? Considering originally arrested assaulting mother probation, think relationship already many layers play. probably bigger example busted relationship homework mishap itself. would great teachers get tested, thoroughly, athletes. want schools opened, need really good testing plan place people. exactly point trying hack deal made...? seems younger less risk. I‚Äôve got 4 6 y/o don‚Äôt play older neighborhood kids yet. WANT fucking Russian vaccine. CANNOT trusted. Basically, virus got here, entire spread virus state state. South wanted blame North North wants blame South. People need get bs realize put risk others actions inactions. talking advisor this. Frenk committed opening really early (he telling public UM would open early May), they‚Äôve come far rescind statement. 

They keep telling everyone part keep everyone safe, isn‚Äôt going happen frat houses dorms. won‚Äôt happen you‚Äôre close much night life. 

Thank kind words. Canes look other, they‚Äôre giving entirely much credit responsibility kids going excited Miami. many labs there? largest one? sorry - disappointed. think perhaps disappointed vaccine available. witnessing Darwinism massive scale, weak (in case idiots) die strong (smart) prosper. know. must hard work places like Onion days. crazy stupid real news is. I'd hard pressed make satire better. Everyone's saying data CDC back, according site data updated July dark, yet funny. Thank laugh, kind stranger! US barred travel ok.... Look, hope become educated. isn‚Äôt hard. life better it. 

Actually knowing you‚Äôre talking about, despite Americans 2020 may tell you, isn‚Äôt negative personality trait. 

It‚Äôs actually good thing. anybody know Denmark keeps track gets sick inflammation phase (meningitis &amp; encephalitis) get sick enough need treatment viral phase (difficulties breathing, coughing, low blood oxygen)? Tragic Kingdom. bizarre response. ever wonder separate doctors kids called 'pediatricians'? 

Why ingesting aspirin dangerous sick kids adults? aspirin look birth certificate? aspirin ask ID?

I'm pediatrician, seems significant biological differences 5 year old bodies work 25 year old bodies work. increase positive results disproportionately higher increase tests. Basic statistics tells us means virus still spreading despite testing infrastructure bolstered. research instead believing everything hear TV. Make conclusion own. better.  I‚Äôll check out, thanks tip. Thailand scores terribly low press freedom. can‚Äôt trust Fuck ain't problem! athletes perform absolutely essential service. ensure proletariat continue spending exorbitant dollars sit arenas paid taxpayers funnel money upward billionaire class! Get chase balls! Get hole! Score fuckin' goal! Kids probably get faster, window infectiousness smaller. Cramming together classroom still create viral bomb likely. Considering already handful physician suicides (that we‚Äôve heard of) direct result pandemic, I‚Äôd say mental health crisis already here. wants talk mental health population busy adding active case index?  pic Brad Pitt here? healthcare system designed provide healthcare. designed profit.  administration full imbeciles. joined union looked back realized hard work really years employers 'friends' taking advantage me. 

PPE signs workers comp signs need displayed rights workplaces us. 

Also, unionize. Together bargain, divided beg! compassion may inadvertently spread asymptomatic. sick weaponized stupid. Yep subtracting totals everything today yesterday get numbers. So, 366 new hospitalizations, 128 death according subtractions totals. IKR? ONE needs billion dollars survive. could 90% taken away STILL $100 million. could 90% $100 million taken away still rich $10 million. $10 million still 5,000 times money currently bank account. I'll hazard guess they're working 5,000 (or 500,000 case billionaire) times harder me, life worth 5,000 mine. It‚Äôs amazing almost every time see comment like guy‚Äôs it‚Äôs account less week old. Funny works... Embalming fluid? Sure, multi-faceted approach exactly we‚Äôre doesn‚Äôt discount fact vaccine isn‚Äôt realistic option unless it‚Äôs nearly 100% effective (and it‚Äôs kind weird would downvote stating basic vaccine math). big part managing public health managing expectations non-medical justifications keeling people upbeat vaccine even vaccine unlikely viable solution. 

Remember, Fauci also told people masks didn‚Äôt help knew well did. effort conserve supplies front line workers. like respect Fauci, understand hasn‚Äôt 100% transparent knows it‚Äôs important stay grounded facts science you‚Äôre capable so. I‚Äôm afraid lot happy horseshit sub encouraging riskier behavior little panic recognition exactly fucked situation is. much worse now! Make done homework. difficult. What‚Äôs story work? Yes OSHA basically meter attendant steroids. give shit you, give shit rules designed serve become inflexible yoke real understanding bigger safety picture. masks ‚ÄúDid become best friends?‚Äù New York shut gradually reopening. Yeah eat shit too. recall anyone China beaten wearing mask. Unlike US met violence wearing mask asking someone wear mask. reading comment made realise MAGA stands make america great again.... 5yrs.... 5yrs looking word thought it‚Äôs like Mega, wanna edgy/cant spell saying maga...... Native Americans aren‚Äôt minority? You‚Äôre good reading comprehension actually easy see, take trip Walmart. 99% material used make products comes China.. packaging, cloth, plastics. shelves arent empty know folded yet. Fur farms disgusting first place, perpetuating horrifically cruel practices harboring methods raising handling animals completely barbaric. Shut let‚Äôs move towards compassionate world. Wake up, It‚Äôs 2020.. don‚Äôt need skin animal jacket. mask, maybe forgot, weren‚Äôt planning going inside. Mesh mask? Ugh. Get out. Jesus Christ. daughter elementary school two years ago, refused get substitute teacher two weeks. Instead, put two classes together. That's one teacher watching nearly 50 students. Either due lack funds hire one lack subs hire.

What makes different year? fact, situation far worse? (Teachers/subs coming back teach due health concerns, plus getting sick several weeks testing positive). mass=on large scale. point words understand message. understand it? Okay great. cares specifics. don‚Äôt need police language. FaceBook - user name God mess. Poor kid. grew fucked home structure struggled homework assignments regular school year. can't even imagine dealing living broken/abusive home trying school work global pandemic going increasing stress potentially keeping children abusers 24/7. use context. Propagating process leaves used spread breed new full plants. similar process spreading ideas/theories/virus. reason word used interchangeably two definitions relate other. response cute too. Beefaroni It‚Äôs broken. There‚Äôs legal way go everything. That‚Äôs super big leap judgement. US attempted moves thus far monopolize vaccine. 

Don‚Äôt trust leadership ensure safe free distribution vaccine. Yeah youre right, fucking honework. hard.

It's literally thing chose to. knew would happen didnt yet chose anyways. Fuck osha. predatory government agency is. Nothing makes osha happier killing small businesses. sympathy. Stop letting people guilt feeling sorry people. never cared anybody else, likely infected many went effect others. people killing innocent people.

These people deserve nothing disdain remembered example deliberate willful ignorance results in.

You every right feel deserved got. sad come this. I've heard nothing hoax kills small percentage. become us Americans think deaths mean nothing? mean one person could die, still concerned. hope senior citizens younger generations actually care live die. Humanity supposed advanced this. It‚Äôs absurd don‚Äôt testing, PCR tests aren‚Äôt complicated.  Feels good validated. August? Sorry break due economic bubble burst going go away soon. want riot. Fear would draw elderly back Leader. way win November (without cheating). country can't coordinate slow spread, earth coordinate vaccinate quarter billion people? Especially without public health system. keep asking show. it. to. me.

No one can.  hospitals masks?

What Kool-Aid drinking? Hospital mask supply disappear storage day pandemic hit. hospital masks, purchase masks. Hospitals account level emergency supply, emergency supply never exceeded outside negligence.

They're condoms lollipops, last fucking day, sanitized re-used, etc. people honestly think hospitals keep masks inventory year round? first respiratory virus existence.

You can't point shitty hospital administration say, ""See! crisis!"" hospital network building additional supply back January, never came close falling short, 180-450 day supply various ppe. 

Any hospital waited end March account lack inventory negligent, best. Hospitals preparing pandemic potential well general public, get news CNN/Fox ffs.  Exactly. year two ago report came cal state University system bunch violations research labs areas campus. CalOSHA major inspections campuses, tweaked lot procedures lab build safety controls processes. changes chemical storage, changes PPE requirements, changes labeling requirements, instituted weekly self safety audits, bunch small things. 

There lots controls put place lower chances incidents happening. change people's work flow, improve safety. fucking point drag politicians houses manslaughter thru neglect sworn duty!?  honest, yes? Easily self-righteous thing I've read day. 

Most America made exact sacrifices back March. us live areas touched Covid yet, we're going first wave. Many us STILL lockdown making terrible sacrifices. Mental health many people deteriorating. 

Yet every time log onto social media watch news, there's another person scolding us actions handful idiots caught cell phone camera. bunch know-it-alls tri-state area scolding us bad boys girls.

Hey bud! wave already! rolled wiped thousands fellow citizens (the ones susceptible it...the ones eventually going get anyway). say again: yet! We're experiencing now, death rates FAR lower NYC experienced. Thank God stupid things like force Covid patients nursing homes like beloved idiot Governor. Yes, people making worse. lot people locked four months incorrectly assured save ""reopen"". many us still holding line need shaking finger us. take stupid letter go straight hell! used work OSHA state plan state. sucked. one end you‚Äôre EHS professional cares protecting workers, end (particularly red leaning state) face pressure higher ups write many citations state would come around cut budget piss off.

It‚Äôs much real issue, lot OSHA offices high turn over, low pay, way many complaints referrals incidents staff handling efficiently. unexplored combinations left open. axe-throwing rented scooter? axe-catching mask eyes? And: would outcome better worse, hospital? - many questions... Stfu dude ashamed Georgian today. never thought I'd say that.  comment removed talking politics literally political post, missing here?

You missed ability read rules sub. entire thread removed matter hours.

Ignoring that, yea right. one actually listened her. misspoke. Yeah pandemic would ding us closing sani wipes correctly plastic covers pieces paper, reusing PPE, cleaning guidelines patients nowhere safe eat drink take breaks (sharing small break room 50 people isn‚Äôt best idea right now). useless actually need them. It‚Äôs you. say trial. Like legal rights defense. 

Governors sworn duties protect like law enforcement does. 

You neglect duties without penalty, hence trial. suspect much larger problem admitted beginning year, takes alot cripple size workforce. help also time Chinese new year basically closes everything month. 

I think problem end year, atleast scale. easy way see computer parts, majority silicon manufacturing China. January everything fine, suddenly availability dropped cliff prices went crazy.. Even started anything here. alternative facts again. buddy bringing home $1600 every week unemployment thing bring home making $61,000 year. complete overkill unemployment. dad texted yesterday told watch he's much camp bs lady feeding audience want hear. know, guys special kind stupid. kill criticism, killed ignorance. People learn that. wish explained photo exactly. Coronavirus what? mother slipped fell broke arm puddle frozen aisle. lawyers contacted said would fruitless sue state ended settling medical expenses essentially.

Haven‚Äôt seen otherwise. probably true happening already. work, one managers 3 weeks now. chest &amp; leg xrays, physical therapy. covid experience apparently created large amounts blood clotting went legs.  
Terrifying. 

It starting hearing progress ... degress ... hartiest no-mask-ers suddenly going full mask. Finally. nothing trans people, correlation equal causation. another strain SARS.

We currently recognize approximately 7-10 strains.

It's virus endemic Wuhan region. built lab almost 20yrs ago.

Ebola endemic certain regions Africa too. LMAO smarty pants thread. say article PCR test article? first test back April, maybe early April testing CA still clusterf\*ck, maybe got antibody test maybe used shitty Chinese test work right. Maybe PCR test person test know back swab got contaminated.

The point maybe double infection covid possible, really basing science poorly written articles Fox news LA? scientific community actual studies indicate double infections real I'll first change mind, I'm going skeptical. Flights might going, *should* carrying passengers travelling essential business. According Government Canada discretionary travel US currently banned August 21, 2020. Examples discretionary/optional travel include:

* tourism
* recreation
* entertainment

All Canadians travelling outside Canada required self-quarantine 14 days upon returning.

How rigorous checks departure gate, percentage people deliberately lying get around restrictions, can't say. I'm sure airlines super-grateful income, therefore particularly motivated great job weeding liars idiots, Canada fair share. broke sick people nothing lose. much dangerous arm chair patriot wear mask (unless required want pay $50 fine) Read article post Total cumulative tests Canada June? Less 2 million. summer tourist season FL beyond me. shit time state correct, comparing India usa case. She‚Äôs jail assault larceny, homework. given opportunity reduced sentence conditional probation, chose comply conditions. 

Further, never said *agreed* it. offered opinion whatsoever, fact. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs life works‚Äù opinion. broke rules, received consequences, *is* works. want opinion, school work never part conditions probation first place.  member US military past former US embassy employee, going China would probably unwise me. deny Chinese oppress people, ESPECIALLY Muslim population, idiot.

They're lazy research whether hear true. extent will, go affiliated websites simplify reinforce lie.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well said! Yes people like getting paid making unemployed. argument people making more, sometimes twice much before. wife risking life nurse everyday paid someone unemployed making minimum wage. Oh buddy Gov got already preparing worst. bad don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs going away making situations much worse.

I honestly believe more. I'm convinced Republicans acting malicious intent make things worse increase power. story OSHA bad? colossal fuck ups company think using American reaction 9/11 model good idea lol. Like probably worst possible model use. There's definitely jellyfish attack risk there. 1% 5% neurological problems include headaches. 

No wonder Americans don‚Äôt trust media tells them. still serious, phrased deceptively it‚Äôs outright lie. pathetic...smh Mississippi Alabama, we‚Äôd ranked last everything. I'm sure, tell someone still believes stuff now, True Believer likely nothing going convince otherwise. sympathies. ""Got sunglasses m'futures bright"" could get highly effective vaccine manage get population actually get inoculated, would thrilled. 

I would also thrilled find $1M hidden refrigerator. level thrilled. 

The respective probabilities either two events occurring maybe single order magnitude misplaced $1M somewhere house. bad thing? Means millions went without requiring medical intervention. Also means death rate significantly lower currently reported. NY claim ""leader."" That's crap TX SC got started again. Crazy think Trump administration made US ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù.

Never would expected UK treat US villain past. thing makes different wearing mask puts others greater risk yourself. act ignorance, act selfishness people critical person. People supposed wear mask necessarily protect themselves, ensure protection others. Masks course help prevent wearer catching virus, main benefit limiting wearer's spread others. 

To use alcoholism example would like someone habitual drunk driver dying alone car accident caused inebriation. Yes sicks see someone die actively kill someone, also must realize continually selfish putting lives risk bad decisions. 128 new deaths

Imagine mass shooting building collapse killed 128 people yesterday. It‚Äôd top story every global news outlet. 

Instead, another Florida day time COVID. comments separating families came around start April.

WHO proclaimed (several times btw.) without response ccp, one could stop virus spreading. gonna go done besides praising ccp. Right? Lol. OSHA Joint Commission worthless, ineffective use tax dollars. really matter 'most US has' talking individual states school districts. I'm Massachussets. would care R FL talking schools?

As far citations general go, reason trust sites see aggressive headlines I'm going re-post anything trust. believe see reputable source discussing this, need find later. I'm Georgian too, way whole year gone I'm embarrassed American general. impressed happened though. social stigma wearing mask, surprised exact opposite US happened. Though fair stigmatize people wear masks. Roger that, Mr. Troll :-) think childishly jealous oppressed people attention get. It‚Äôs like teenage girls pretending they‚Äôre anorexic girls crowd around beg eat. one saying ‚Äúhey, check Karen friends tough times‚Äù want attention too. say went supermarket *discriminated against*.  Yeah think agree. kind got put assumption classrooms big/dense, since they're actually pretty close worked solution haha better. healthy. dont give fuck. easy though. Block roads florida. flights put florida grounded.

Boom know risks proceed anyway. life short, follow dreams! things pointed true. Schools important great variety reasons, children kept school increased risk. 

Sadly, emphatically \_not\_ Trump administration arguing vociferously reopening them. care. 1000 cases.  Two people injured table saw within months, hope business got big ol fine.

Heyyy ooohhhh. Patricide Thankfully courts take time won‚Äôt huge cliff. Hopefully January get fix haven‚Äôt cases go court system yet. probably correct view point I'm far SF Bay Area 2 hrs drive get there. Well, right I'm actually bay dog sitting. live outside it. legitimately less people Bay semi rural farmtown, comparison.

At home outdoor dining packed, grocery stores rednecks wearing masks, people get huffy roll eyes stomp feet told need flat ignore parks packed despite services closed cities counties able enforce without backing sheriff police saying enforce shutdowns encourages people well... sheriff said kick barbecue park! Time party! closed parts physically locked parks rec. parking 'closed' people ignore go city gates.

SF LA part well. counties badly Newsom scold redneck dumbass parts, like live! We're 'y'all need behave' list right now. I'm currently watching healthcare equivalent cutting nose spite face every conference Gavin swallowed rocks he's gone hoarse telling people stupid.

California get pat back dumb. metros like SF, LA San Diego, yep! Newsom, yep! Rest us surrounded idiots. Get 80 year old ladies ass line grocery store- mask, six feet. Like closer normally would stand like act defiance violate personal space lines.

Hour outside metros Texas Lite. They're kinda shit Arkansas positivity rate. governor always reports lower really day of, goes back updates actual higher rate next days never mentioning new rate. wish national news investigator would get case cause they're definitely massaging numbers one calling governor out. Ah yes. Jail 15 year olds. Let guess, white? money 5 seconds fame. First, schools set provide online education forced close, different taking class designed online learning, teacher experience online education. Second, school case worker pointed above, IEP means already struggling realtively structured school environment, took time adjust even less structured environment. 

The fact *you* struggle something mean ""easy"". means difficult *for you*, true true everyone. actual teacher said track given special needs. social worker violated probation even talking teacher. bother all?  morbidly ironic February, Trump tweeted Nero. though, use rates per capita. hard.  seems like lifetime ago, now. Yes scold daddy. Scold harder til achieve absolution thought, word deed. ever achieve thought-communism wouldn‚Äôt get delicious scoldings anymore. yummy pickle find in. Good see percentage people wearing masks growing, happy 100%. Trump used say diseases personal Vietnam... Tons deniers claiming children immune COVID19. 

Think evil horrid is... willing sacrifice children President look bad. 

It's bad enough can't rely government, people actively pushing oppressing truth reality COVID19. 

Truly deplorable. states labeled hoax follow President's orders behave deserving fate. I'm stranger internet, know what's best child.

Still, can't see classroom 10 students safer pod 2 families. pod get pick parents families allowed. school idiot parents children teachers (because teachers people too, fallible) mixed in. also Catalan trial, also got published yesterday and[ even exception? every 30 year old country got Covid 3 100 needed put ventilator would still exception. increase positive results disproportionately higher increase tests. Basic statistics tells us means virus still spreading despite testing infrastructure bolstered.

What another reason high positivity exclusion negatives potential skew key statistic known positivity rate, percentage total tests positive, indicator community spread. It‚Äôs unclear significantly incomplete reporting may altered state‚Äôs COVID-19 tracking That‚Äôs fantastic idea. Might anything muh rights! maskholes, reminder even us take every precaution stay vigilant. literally wants hill dies 'but freeedumbbb!' Absolutely, directly financially benefitting violations would unethical hell. Huh. get tested without breaking quarantine?

I see CDC fact note healthcare providers might recommend two negative tests, also say isolated minimum 10 days testing positive, maybe two negative tests isolated? person perpetually bullied made miserable people levels school, managed become functional physician (albeit introverted), always get puzzled people put much weight 'socialization' point accepting avoidable potentially fatal (indirect) risk. 

Almost like foreign concept adapt flexible coming across challenge. reliable source US aircraft carriers stand sail place first working vaccine.

It's surprise Chinese ones dared start distribution (to military). Everything come maintaining vehicle. Oil changes, spark plugs, filters, belts, hoses, fixing oil leaks, transmission flush, tire rotation, alignments.   hell? Florida active COVID hospitalizations CA does? pretty much saying China functional government original comment said 'defect' New plan: Defund ICE, send funding OSHA I'm lucky furbabies even care credit card debt Laurel's severe environmental allergies. family taken good care shown really important life.

Dogs new toilet paper, kitten season spay neuter clinics closed long time. rule pocket pets landlord allow cats. body's immune system response generally thought voluntary process. lie isn‚Äôt true. you‚Äôre going declare things, probably make sure know you‚Äôre talking first, you‚Äôre spreading misinformation. 

And another preprint. Again, authors pulled original preprint wasn‚Äôt accurate. 

They fucked up. 

Again, let clear. virus attack cells. absolutely proof this. entire conspiracy talking point paper came months ago paper pulled. reason know right-wing conspiracy theorists early latched onto it, claimed means virus version lab-created hiv sent Chinese. 

Why know don‚Äôt know retraction authors makes wonder you‚Äôre right-wing conspiracy theorist they‚Äôre literally ones still think true. you‚Äôre solution poverty would cause deaths? Winter coming. cracked up. sub gave crazy anxiety beginning fear mongering. tune look important news wonder online classes work? Parents need work. many questions yet answered One study included loss taste/smell neurological problem. hit point produce whatever fear-inducing headline want. 

Not saying information isn‚Äôt important useful. people shouldn‚Äôt taking precautions don‚Äôt know long term effects. however saying media (and sub) like write headlines make everything gloom doom. Kinda like reports I‚Äôve seen every major source bubonic plague squirrel brain eating amoeba cases occur yearly. Starting around 1776 assume? Lol Alberta basically Texas Canada... it‚Äôs really surprise. Standard media sensationalism.. specify electric scooter Hopefully blue team releases retroactive correct numbers showing never got better. would change red team supporter's minds. care facts reality. yelling 2

because dad tube throat. Every statistic far shows direct correlation income level risk factor (aka. afford remain safe exposure, did).

Statistics also indicate besides *individual* comorbidities, risk might directly connected blood type. people might get prioritised according actual ABO bloodgroup.

There support specific groups poor based parents looked like.  India 751 cases per million population moment. US 11 240. Right now, US significantly worse India. Germany also higher case incidence per million population India. 

Do personally think good idea? Nope. logic behind allowing travellers India, US. everyone get covid defeated soon herd immunity work swiftly. Gotcha. piece past blade reached contacted spinning blade? Lol bro China already WW3. Thank much ""speech"" unfortunately stolen. 

It like joke/meme english speakers interacted germans.

I hope get point level. try improve it... (I already dreamed twice english) US still pushing starting sports teams can‚Äôt even figure open schools slow spread disease? I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm one thinking this. probably better way, helps prevent corruption. produced US would full corn syrup anyway. Remember said masks uneffective don‚Äôt either. british vaccine. saw postal worker standing 2 feet away neighbor talking other, neither wearing mask. I'm NV reported OSHA (this governor said do), OSHA actually called back tell anything USPS federal state mask mandate apply. wasted time telling pound sand could working actual problem. Like shouldn‚Äôt people ballot campaign people write liked best first second third choose based popular. states list article aren‚Äôt exactly huge vacation spots. mean seriously ‚Äì Alabama? Blame outsiders want, residents drove surge. ÔøºÔøºÔøº state currently plans test teachers/school staff 100% opening 5 days week... teacher friends nervous. would cool Trump let Cuban doctors in. We've waging propaganda war them. hoax defeat orange thing. take away freedoms!
















/s remember living AZ hearing ads like: ‚ÄúNow summer tackle outdoor projects like painting house‚Äù. Summer isn‚Äôt north. people refused use seat belts motorcycle helmets hurt most. know United States isn‚Äôt traditionally mask culture, people need step back realize masks saving lives. know it‚Äôs that, stigma definitely factor believe. reopen schools fall... word think applies, context little bit different here. people fucking kruges! Kruges named dunning-kruger effect, people think lot intelligent actually are, overestimate knowledge abilities understanding. Irony harsh mistress.

It‚Äôs specific topic.

Whatever do, read comments Americans can't name single Canadian province distinction important. ""One death tragedy, million deaths statistic."" - Stalin

Our expectations collapsing level blunt, heartless cynicism. understand Americans locking something virus... Maybe vaccine ready? think it‚Äôs ‚Äúdo should, *have* to‚Äù.

Edit: views. believe Kemp believes. party want mandatory masks think cares appeasing base following public health guidelines. I've heard many anecdotal stories like this. almost like know least one person telltale symptoms, tested negative, get test. mom terrible cough three weeks, symptoms, antibody test negative. 

So stories, think people asymptomatic, probably already exposed it. I'm hopeful spread much realize. problem every science article contradicted every week

That's problem. 

The problem people incapable understanding science fucking works. continually update views based upon new information


For example, data saying ""kids get often"" based testing severely rationed, restricted people severe symptoms. Well - guess what? know kids get severe symptoms often. therefore previous data suspect draw conclusions it. 

Now, know improved understanding kids certainly get spread That‚Äôs re-infections hard confirm... That's first intelligent remark I've heard you. That's exactly point made original comment. upvote. Dude fucked already started electric shutoffs town live in, per outcries local FB page. Many large companies extending deferments, city buys large company ""resells"" us, thing. middle large heat wave. feel bad folks. Yeah see comparison completely add up. obviously give full details mom's alcoholism absolutely affected people sometimes abusive/neglectful sister well basically driving drunk every day life many many years put people danger. comparison came mind read comment agree people wearing mask selfishly putting others risk well.  Voting. Yep, city stated masks must least two layers material. Two layers mesh isn‚Äôt great, it‚Äôs better one. problem governor initiated mask order bite enforcement. don‚Äôt know illness takes sense taste smell   Pardon ignorance important distinction? Science made nuclear bomb.

Politics allowed us use nuclear bomb.

What good either one?

Its better dumb.

BURN SCHOOLS DOWN, EDUCATION MISTAKE.

NINTENDO 64 NEED. Well, kids smaller human beings, I'm gonna say, yes. Yes can. spread every single thing, huge stretch think could maybe possibly spread new thing too. Rocket surgery. Yep. obviously written someone doesn‚Äôt live somewhere hot. someone lives AZ without doubt tell don‚Äôt go outdoors 117 degrees (actual temperature past weekend) fact cater things indoors. mean that? Well, example AZ things like indoor playgrounds children. Why? 3rd degree burns playing aluminum slide outdoors aren‚Äôt pleasant. entire city built around indoors, AC summer long, reason indoor stadiums NFL, MLB, etc, it‚Äôs keep snow like folks north it‚Äôs turn AC on. Couple governor who‚Äôs pretty much everything wrong see disaster AZ. again, virus might die shut AC‚Äôs roast houses heat stroke real thing, lead hospitalization quick quicker COVID. 

Ya know call people walking around outdoors places like Old Town Scottsdale July? towners. people scream loudest personal responsibility can‚Äôt seem themselves. course is. hoping NFL NBA (contact sports) would disappear 2021. full awful people don‚Äôt care China holocaust. easier doomsayer optimist. doomsayer wrong, claim especially cautious everyone forgets. optimist wrong, look best like idiot worst like negligent.

There's lot ""told so"" potential taking doomy view. point stop reading sub forever live one purple areas Florida map. think survey wrong least half people see daily basis wearing them. Even still fly ~~ignore quarantine~~ carry usual... vigilantes Christopher dorner guy flew plane irs high-rise San Antonio high schools first 3 weeks distance learning making in-school start week September 7th. One district come plan afterwards, 2 days in, 3 days out, staggering lower upper grades . others ‚Äòwait see‚Äô. 

With high school sports, know allowing volleyball practice district. Football, Texas multi-billion dollar business, scheduled start beginning August, pushed 1 week UIL. possible reason masks needed every srtain flu, simple fact particular disease much contagious flu we've ever seen, fact killed millions people 6 months.
As far what's open what's not?
That's easy.
That's politicians work.
They give damn live die. mean can't anything manbearpig ...........you win round. see lol. 

I realize states actually tax income, thought made exempt need sports. meant better better giving fuck people. Let's look fog claims reverse.

* finalized results British RECOVERY trial (the one released preliminary report HCQ's failure month ago), US pharma involvement here.
* enough early claims would work hospitalized patients, refuted trial (plus many observational studies it.)
* [RCT shown work even given early possible.
* Hydroxychloroquine **a** zinc ionophore. **the** zinc ionophore evidence suggests would better [nearly zinc ionophores treating - least, enough evidence justify testing zinc, none ionophores.
* early adopter claimed needs zinc work NY's Zelenko. France's Raoult much influential pushing drug, consider zinc necessary. Find ""everyone oppressed white people"" guy. really - mean, excluded covid data... move one might expect pocket. terrifying part fact antibodies (NOT immunity, see &amp; B memory cells) fade three months. amount cases must missed Jan/Feb-April??? one really serological studies late April/May. Tons people could‚Äôve just. Didn‚Äôt show up. That‚Äôs terrifying. That‚Äôs fast thing move. seem like willfully ignorant, uncompassionate maskholes veterans told truth, CDC guidelines federally enforceable law. OSHA utilizes federal courts enforcement can‚Äôt anything unless it‚Äôs backed law. It‚Äôs government agency that‚Äôs desperately underfunded employees can‚Äôt act independently, follow procedure won‚Äôt hold anyway. think job doesn‚Äôt mean is. 

Document everything work. Call county/state health department, county/state labor board, local news. Okay word, get productive brah Butthole Serfers person hook up? Aircraft Carriers ineffective crews get coronavirus Makes sense surface you‚Äôre asking us spend overhead run events 90% sure fans. Ticket sales, alcohol, food etc money makers. Digging bigger hole sake players playing half asses season hard sell. Covid 38 like way think. Wow story anti masker low key inspiring, great job him! think 2 days worth data show 0.1% change enough make argument? People aren‚Äôt known smart around here. Haha exactly country mess. get stuff allowed. average class comparable. 

My point classes like 40 kids US. schools add trailers fit kids. neighborhoods, small old school buildings basically gotten turned Frankenstein monsters try squeeze many kids possible.

[Here‚Äôs explaining them. 

[Another detailing overcrowded schools are. Francis Lewis High School capacity 2400 4600 students.

As far understand, please correct wrong, Netherlands pretty much capping class sizes 30 kids most. hate American impulse punish instead empathize. We're interested revenge schadenfreude actually improving things.

Narcissism. pathological narcissism bred century consumer advertising propaganda.  They‚Äôre cute AF. local high school town (central IL) held football practice last night, fucking maroons.. doubt it... apparently good given limited experience can't see anyone else wanting take chance them. MLB already contract PED testing natural extension competition testing. Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea low death rates similar China's , let see come excuse one want see reverse map Meanwhile mile away Hermosa there‚Äôs jackasses everywhere packing outdoor dining areas pier masks Con men often get marks distrust everyone them. that's thing boggles mind. 

If ""just like flu"" - kids get spread like fucking crazy!!! know wearing mask outside health care facilities offers little, any, protection infection....again, quote medical professionals. Median viral loads differ significantly comparing coughing samples COVID-19 patients without mask, surgical mask, cloth mask, suggesting masks ineffective filtering SARS-CoV-2....again medical professional quote. went testing failures riots mask failures sprinkled hospital capacity issues baseline 85% capacity. Excess mortality accelerating greater pace covid alone. got 30% Americans unable pay rent now. Since .5% IFR rate according CDC stir hypochondriacs .15% .4% next time? doctor leaders deem acceptable laughingly falsely claim lying us protect own? .15% .3% .4%? know 2 people got covid sick 2 days. ran 4 miles one guy 3 weeks later. know 15 people laid work. I'm well aware risks. IFR continue trending month year. fun, every winter? would save lives. shut every winter save lives. Ohio here. around Cleveland Columbus problem smaller cities pretty much forced go ED place accept it. Better shut Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yep Atlanta engine state. go back normal economy, matter governor Atlanta board. far? Like expect Florida‚Äôs numbers climb days end? end Fox News election . Sickening Y‚Äôall would need temporarily hire staff.

I don‚Äôt know probable is, doesn‚Äôt seem impossible? state doesn‚Äôt yet need additional mortuary trucks, said Seth Christensen, spokesman Texas Division Emergency Management. standby case local municipalities get overrun Covid-19 deaths. that's case probably covid since 80's. Economic fallout last decades. Never mind hundreds thousands people died.

Historical perspective helps though. isnt black death. Spanish flu. global famine. world War. awful, cataclysmic.

Except military. military always solution. hate government love military, dumb. part government like one specialized killing people **very** expensive ways.  Wonder low-mask regions common... I'm opposed that, really want see perp walk handcuffs.  True, see hit women harder. know couple considering quoting jobs scaling back hours home school come fall. Old friend asking online since special education teacher.

What happens get flu like symptoms need get tested? streamlined access teachers g get tested get results back? labs week long delays.

It's minimum three day quarantine testing. extended additional sick leave testing times?

During testing times, teachers need away class. districts procuring additional substitutes cover days?

If teacher tests positive, minimum two weeks out. districts handle leave pay quarantine times? districts handle additional substitutes extended times considering already shortage available substitutes?

There requirements wear masks, distance, additional cleaning sanitizing. charge additional cleaning? janitorial staff brought in? teachers, given hazard pay exposure new chemicals potentially COVID 19 cleaning? district getting additional funding substitutes, masks, sanitizer cleaning supplies? funding cut areas? providing masks sanitizer students expected bring own? teachers either provide forced send students home?

Classrooms already crowded is. students expected keep six feet distance desks? hybrid model split online/ class teaching, district provide instruction maintain class online environment? district provide aides manage room teacher focuses online class expected manage spaces simultaneously? hybrid becomes normal, substitutes handle split learning environment?

There answers none questions. would prefer go back, many know it'll mess. mean, handle COVID positive cases campus. student family test positive? can't say class. student campus tested positive, child potential exposure? sending 'potential exposure' letters emails year decide send none all.

In areas expanding spread can't it. I'm one 1st quarter online only.  Yeah, protesters protesting wearing mask also mix - Don‚Äôt forget them. 

Look get it, everybody wants serviced unfortunately lives can‚Äôt shouldn‚Äôt spared sake someone getting sammich on.

Milena Holdert Renee van Hest

The RIVM Ministry Health, Welfare Sport (VWS) got mixed much corona crisis. good development politics science. That's chairman Jet Bussemaker Council Public Health &amp; Society says New Year's Eve.



Professor Public Administration Michiel de Vries also concerns believes RIVM become independent administrative body. ""You ask yourself: independent much allow influenced people ministry would like hear something?



Apart politics?



At beginning crisis, cabinet gave RIVM great deal authority body gave scientific advice independently politics. practice RIVM ministry close other.



The ministry involved drawing certain guidelines, example use mouth masks elder care, according research Nieuwsuur. Nurses administrators critical guidelines, partly wanted use mouth masks often quickly. guidelines made difficult.



How could corona guidelines led unsafe situations? Nieuwsuur conducted months research corona crisis elderly care. Watch video:



RIVM guidelines elderly care meagre scientific basis

Care domes wanted report criticism RIVM. 'intermediary', ministry would convey criticism, practice guidelines hardly changed all. Mouth masks remained ""unnecessary"" many situations.



Documents Nieuwsuur's disposal show scarcity decisive government's distribution system protective equipment. Care domes suspect guidelines remained unchanged match scarcity. ""And much safety care worker taken starting point, apparently existing political choice,"" says Hans Buijing, director Zorgthuisnl branch association.



Christina Vandenbroucke, former chairman Working Group Infection Prevention, previously drew guidelines mouth masks elder care, says understand ministry role discussion scientific guidelines, even ""intermediary"".



When wrote guidelines, direct contact elder care. ""If make guidelines particular group, involve people professional group advisors practice. ministry different knowledge different role.""



Political consideration



President Bussemaker RVS, independent advisory body government parliament, also believes science politics corona crisis ""have become much obscured"".



For example, RIVM top executive Jaap van Dissel said last month altimeter rule would ""more complicated"" apply aircraft, ""in order still able fly reasonable prices"". Bussemaker calls question expensive something ""a political consideration. That's director RIVM.""



""It science good people could think RIVM uses arguments actually based political expediency. harmful science, ultimately also politics, keep running behind facts"".



Professor Michiel de Vries: ""RIVM say safest. able determine want say basis scientific evidence completely independently"".

Pasta marinara sprinkled parmesan cheese. mention Pandemic status determined spread, mortality. author whole imbecile. Per capita*

That's big thing note. Canada getting way cases total states, obvious title implies otherwise.

I've seen lot demonstrably misleading information making Canada vs US seem much worse is. really bad, bad sold headlines.

I suppose thats nature headlines age though.

I track state's (NH) numbers daily 24 new cases yesterday. 24. clearly retarded ""Oops.""

\-god Without social media coronavirus, bad choices didn‚Äôt consequences. Happy I‚Äôm adult days. new album coming out!!! Yay!!!

When Shaun Morgan lived NH, Seether used play tiny little venue called Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom. Saw many times there. (Fangirl fainting. LOL.) even care anymore yeah, look florida wildly fluctuating cases, numbesr probably going randomness many tests day heh. Went Target get essentials saw several mothers (wearing masks) pushing baby strollers. almost seems people understand virus transmission works. Sure, might protected unmasked baby isn't... Hell, infants small children even public right now... WTF!? Trump wants kids school full time parents get work boost economy November.

Therefore, ""kids get coronavirus."" Wait till get bill. Feel free think return bad idea. act like six positive tests 10,000 bad thing. That's ignorance. nowhere close herd immunity, that's suggesting. California's rise also coinsided beaches opening &amp; general lack social distancing amongst population.

Portland, Seattle, DC, &amp; Minneapolis seen consistent protests also seen type dramatic surges seen states pushed fast reopen. least Aztecs front human sacrifice.

I hate articles try minimize death hundreds thousands. virus killed morons. Calm bro. Wait till one Disney employees gets pregnant mask order FHM thinks would make people sick prone going outside potentially spread infection. Now, good social security, people go work sick (many used due misplaced work ethics, anymore though).

The US, far tell, wear masks stay home sick. ‚ÄúBoycott crayola! They‚Äôre trying save kids!!‚Äù surely train it. drink tape water, play dirt, stuff... fuck downvoted?! analysis looks exactly use per capita, U.S almost 10 times many people every metric counting virus' impact lot worse 10x. meds bills must millions, covered insurance she'll get complications result Corona later life. fucking mask.

I‚Äôm afraid lung issues long term issues. sympathy. hope didnt kill anyone else. I'm glad say friends I've seen cool pandemic we're ravers festival goers. sad see attitude lot oc residents. think recovering COVID patients treated TBI since experiencing similar symptoms post COVID someone severe concussion. ""just like flu"" - kids get spread like fucking crazy!!!

Exactly. Flu spreads like wildfire schools. people flu go school work, house flu invite people over, flu parties. 

It's *nothing* like flu, even *exactly* like flu, **still like flu** **even people screaming ""it's like flu"" even treating differently flu.** 

It's fucking maddening. great source. history reporting things fail fact checking efforts, ""extreme right"" side bias spectrum. Well, I'd think mist would help settle particles air. Similar pollen counts go rain. read article apparently online courses dont work students teachers, according students, responsive all. lot parents phone district open schools fall. dont know think tbh.

The institutions supposed keep us safe failing us. always knew holy fuck. Zero risk. Think like this:

The air water. Outdoors air = lake fresh river water constantly flowing in, indoors air = bucket stale water.

A person coronavirus breathing/coughing = person pissing veery slowly said water.

If someone pisses bucket hour, water disgusting, want taste that. regular 21 year old cuts ways. virus gets cracks mutating every additional host. However strain spread extremely widely nigh-impossible mutant replace. new strain starts one person needs find *susceptible* people faster widespread one does.

Most new variants virus killed either host's immune system (they sick symptoms stay home) main virus strain (no available new hosts). OC heavily conservative. mocking claiming protests. WE'VE WARNING YOU, WTF Hm. would assume opposite. today doesn‚Äôt include counts past days needed matching.

Why?

Same Reason - God wills number up, keep safe?

Same goes seat belts, child safety locks, airbags, pollution control, lead paint leaded gas, mercury use, radium use asbestos, name few.

They believe buyer beware - know best - let market decide. market vertical integration limits choices too. definitely risk children (apart children much need parents alive).

I remember twitter video February, nurses collecting bodies two girls hospital Wuhan. Zipping black body bags. probably heartbreaking thing I've seen life.

And people might say fake seen worst thinkable case became reality. Antivaxxers bioterrorists Based. stick actual real reasons people wear masks.

They care those. wear masks seasonal flu, bother flu?

The ""No shirt, shoes"" argument hits reasoning can't forced wear masks. place strike thry gave shit science helping others, they'd already wear them.

A ""freedom"" argument change whether accustomed not. One may grown telling black folks drink another fountain, give one freedom continue it. social worker actually verify school whether she'd done work required do. missed deadlines, making progress, according school, difficult see actually broke terms probation. social worker based decision one statement mother, reevaluate got conflicting information. would feel sent back detetion actually violated terms probation? upset? worry friend.. sarcasm lost me.

Since pandemic began we‚Äôve visited inspectors least 4 times. show unannounced street clothes walk around shop taking pictures. introduce they‚Äôre done.

With schools closed, parents less likely work, spending money. hits economy hard.


With schools closed, parents struggle work makes hard get money survive.


Plus, sadly, there's lot parents need schools take children babysit them, cause can't stand around children.

All combines people wanting believe schools reopen, even logic flawed.

There seem 5 scenarios Cells could interact Coronavirus, supporters (some scenarios supporters others).

1.	Best case scenario- cells prevent symptomatic reinfection prevent becoming contagious.
2.	T Cells prevent symptomatic reinfection, prevent becoming contagious. scenario, people got second time would asymptomatic carriers.
3.	T Cells prevent symptomatic reinfection, cause milder symptoms.
4.	T Cells affect symptoms reinfected. reinfection scenario would first time.
5.	Worst case scenario- Cells whatever antibodies left respond Coronavirus incorrectly, making symptoms worse time get la Dengue Fever. sure can‚Äôt figure good for! 15 issues. fact, that's worst. point?

I've since birth. man every women alive today culpable live society hates women weaponizes femininity hate destroy men.

I agreed point got society hating women part, suspect argument end. understand worldview starts basic truth, able convince otherwise. agree every man woman culpability failures weaknesses get upset something someone posts online girls get death threats playing video games, going school standing sexual violence.

See, made jump supported anything I've said. right, get upset people treat group source problems, see ever ending positive light. Telling men completely fault society going good way move right direction society, see fomenting division. also upset girls get death threats playing game, going school, standing sexual violence. Yeah possible. extremely mild case probably enough antibodies floating around. Antibodies diminish viral infections. Yes spread it.  spreading make trump look bad?  decide yourself.... ain't first, last.

We're ***shit*** nursing homes. go nursing home NH. issue COVID. He'll probably win another term governor lol Lol. Literally best thing disease say ban counties mandating masks. puts Kemp that's it.

Florida global epicenter infections mask mandate Disney open. DeSantis asleep wheel. Yeah anxiety following January taking precautions immediately. many people didn‚Äôt believe even obviously taking off. I‚Äôm sure study makes 100% sense... Yeah affording one that. got petty revenge quit. That's shills sycophants, top intrusion science based political ideology. feelings  trust government team charge. love America!  even Singaporean press can't trusted ?

is reliable  Thanks selfish jerks making us suffer longer British please explain pays maskers haters get virus. health insurance.!! I'm assuming wrongly course mask haters afraid dying!!! brains work? Yep. compare ""stars"" 600-lb Life, yeah, sure - healthier them, means nothing. Overton window health keeps shifting... Raw data: 

Graph data:   True... Oh countries said ""no"" italy banned flights china january asked extend ban entire EU. bigger reason trump downplays virus ridiculed people wearing masks. taken political statement legion morons follow him. recently. Overall Ontario (37k cases) Quebec (57k cases) worst first months due mismanaged privatized long term care homes. OSHA going receiving lawsuit two, imagine Nothing surprising team effort. looks like fetal alcohol syndrome. I'm tempted write: ""Open - God know own"" probably helpful constructive.

Don't open churches without stringent safety place followed. Otherwise decline Christianity get unexpected boost. Don‚Äôt already test covid? one favorite Subreddits. Hi I‚Äôm virologist. Skeptical vaccines I‚Äôm skeptical therapeutic data out. 

Of vaccine candidates there, let‚Äôs say 5, approach 50% efficacy, alone, adjuvants work boost vaccine alone. 

The shingrix vaccine alone major improvement zostavax addition several adjuvants increase efficacy raising 45-50 90-98 so. 

Even seniors zostavax vaccine loses durability efficacy age increases, gsks version adjuvants think 60 % points higher zostavax. 

I believe adjuvants viable vaccine soon enough. 

It‚Äôs gonna fuckin nightmare southern states want sit asses listening ilk. Fine whatfuckinever. Hell probably Easter 2022 Oh? private corporation oversees workplace saftey regulations?

Theyre job *at all* Keep printing money giving away see plenty death. Mark words. Oh, quit putting words mouth, say anything wanting watch people die. tough spot in... fellow EHS professional, can‚Äôt even imagine bad lot stories hear reddit. know bad employers there, haven‚Äôt personally worked yet.

The companies I‚Äôve worked sent letters inspected state ran programs federal both. sounds like exception rule though. Since whites dwindling population, racist yet?  Probably parents give children bleach enemas autism. Actually says attempt got overwhelmed really quickly. someone actual ADHD diagnosis, absolutely see happened. lucky enough good support system taught good coping mechanisms, ""being lazy"" ""not trying"" something lot people ADHD get accused of, despite case. Even ADHD symptoms, clearly understand role executive functions play motivation, organization, etc. Again, challenges actually make qualified judge people, especually people never even met. fact feel need says much young lady. Maybe think that's case.

I suspect conversation going productive I'll end wish best luck going forward. there's limited amount resources, creating resources requires labor. working boss takes labor value make sense? one person reap rewards everyone else's hard work?

America succeeded. Like said last comment, people dying direct results capitalism. Look state country today, look like success?

The American middle class already decimated. Wages stagnated everything else goes up. terrifying future bread lines subsistence one many Americans already live in.

I'm actually sure desire politically, I'm still working out. think ideal looks something like nation worker owned communes share profits labor trade communes.

Is happened? constitutional right severe health risk community? 1A though.. post shows uninformed reddit is. I'm left leaning, holy fuck make look like idiots. work state office state OSHA; realize literally thousands people called protest literally everything workplace Walmart worker smoking outside without mask local office?

These everyday workers like yourself. limited policy procedures like yourself. say quit protest - fuck then. mad people making rules, everyday wage slave shit harrassed COVID Karen's. literally shooting foot criticizing workers. people Trumps ilk. thought America hit rock bottom, wrong. Buckle up, going get worse. would helpful know February March.   Didier Raoult style. HBCB (was? lived NH decade) great venue! Easy get to/from, good sound, always awesome bands booked.

Yeah, we're still democracy, move China want that, though. I'm tired every news story ""excuse fuck?"" moment. Sounds like Governer, Pete ""dipshit fuckface"" Ricketts.

Now let's trace see *where* 65+ caught virus *from*. Time remove parenting privileges. Apparently pulled straps reminder: preliminary reports peer-reviewed. regarded conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, reported news media established information. America, one fact matters, there. 24-64 means non-schooling, working age. feel guilty. recount family's story helps save least one life changing someone's mind distancing + masks, story worth telling. Ok accountability Karen think there's enough info time take seriously. hard virus spread people already immune. Plenty anti-trump comments here. see even though purely political. kids dont go school, probably revert woman housewife man goes work. Since parents cant work 9-5 job take care kids. never masturbated porn online ever saying.

Never said that, fact admitted perfect regard.
 take implicit bias test online see part problem. helps us remind need constantly work fix things.

I agree I'm part problem, though suspect disagree problem actually is. would suggest also part problem though. 

For points, agree much racism argument sexism argument, I'll try go far it. agree society lot problems racism historically currently, though may may agree solutions that. new slogan ""Come meth, leave covid!"" loooove I, two random nobodies internet, would managed outbreak better government. Looooove original person, google search best/worst states work US. Georgia 50 (looked first 3 stopped). generally 46 47 always Alabama Mississippi. People also much compliant. know what's stupid? care make masks mandatory. long leaves individual mayors handle City would literally absolve blame could possibly keep credibility. stupid part comes in. suing mayor Atlanta enforcing mask rule. would sue one mayors taken burden bad guy put themselves? That's level stupidity at. sat plane time too. know flew ? never going end, it? not.
If say something¬†should not¬†happen, mean  happened, wish did.

So wishing happen. 
So Science ignored wish schools reopen. factual statement long stretch th imagination. even saying open schools. wish. 
So grant wishes. Well know there‚Äôs lot us better way thin us out? never transmission rate one. Close one, sure, well one? Never. Anyone thought reopening without mask mandate was/is idiot, applies governor unfortunately.  course going burn out. can't put kind responsibility kid already problems, know it. Yes old famous study. chose prominence still widely cited. insist here's recent overview ARDS. There's plenty bother must insist seeing sources make accepting dubious journalist reports sceptical scientific community consensus. unearth think exists data supporting lack oxygen treated? mom anti mask, asked crochet one her. politely declined.

None means perfect state, racism real today, would idiot think world better place 20 years ago. idiotic thinking. easy (stupid) argue need laws murder, it. Sure, works people, reason laws. Actually, üò£ Trump heard Boris say ""heard immunity"" thought great idea Oh cool - state house Georgia stone mountain? thoughts exactly... go again: science way of........(foggy thoughts happening.......) freedom guess? /s Well, infectivity virus children would shed. low enough levels, even positive PCR, labs can‚Äôt grow virus idea infectious possibly sensitivity tests high. pressured open-up idiots would never vote first place.

\*my son, busy licking doorknob ""as joke""\* mom took press.

Wear damned masks! stops business buying safe model? Money. thought others whatsoever, winning imaginary dispute.

That's costco karens see videos screaming ""i'm american citizen"" ""i right shop here"". want feel like they've ""won"" exerted power people. speaks volumes type life have. FYI journalists British sky News TIME dat video

can trusted No. Don‚Äôt bring bath salts this, know innocent ! Without requiring masks too, right?

I know added mask mandate believe reopening started hiring? Ok dude. Quit blaming others problems never reach peak dumb. keep peaking even further! #Pogger Champion white kid wouldnt jailed. topic way I've able get people refuse wear masks bluntly call ""patriotism"", ask able make tiny sacrifice sake country. almost guarantee see American flag social media profile picture virulent anti-masker hiding behind it. Regardless warped sense patriotism is, calling lack seems strike chord them. Granted few, logic, facts, science work crowd ... need appeal something much base. 25 percent schools open next month, USA total collapse September October. Kids going spread family like wildfire. symptoms people ADHD often have, actual ADHD diagnosis? thing. mentioned anxiety depression eslewhere, lot overlap symptoms conditions ADHD, mean actually ADHD. sources garbage yougov link says 60% people usa wearing mask april demonstrably true whatsoever.

It also says us mask currently 74% straight wrong. Also says us mask use higher canada canada mandates wear masks, true.

Bad sourcing. Data inaccurate around. Maybe yougov asked total 50 people New York 38 said yes, data obviously doesnt jive reality.

Downvote want, saying 74% us wears masks lies.

Ah, see. poster discovered misleading link week ago trying spread show us really well. Wish could part phase 3, sign already 1. Yeah, dudes scary, look NFAC, they're clearly racist, heavily armed black nationalist organization.
2. also disciplined well organized. vandalize anything violate laws action.
3. wore masks, outdoors, 500 count, i.e. significantly increase spread COVID. entitled opinion! Maybe try contributing conversation next time.  Murder homework Tide works service center.

/s think people going flow, sure entitled.  governments many countries actively encouraging tourism, prices lower normal, people go?

Unless follow pandemic extremely closely, imagine people see governments opening up, reassuring measures put place, assume fine travel within Europe now. I‚Äôve heard reports measles parties too, herd immunity measles it‚Äôs still BAD IDEA intentionally infect people misleading. [Ontario Alberta number cases per Quebec (the least culturally ""American"" province, surely) 3x cases per capita both. Alberta also done per capita testing province. person could easily white still think he'd hold opinion. everyone bases everything race. fact says lot him. even understand would question.  practically means could murder without consequences mind, since know age. think care kids, ones committing violent crimes mind you. care myself, believe me. Wow, capitalism.

Has pros cons. efficient economic system, fair. Socialism fair, least efficient economic system. Reason US economy strong. son getting married Atlanta October.  doesn‚Äôt want anyone wear masks since would ruin photos. 


I legitimately terrified. wanna prove good guy, start rather complaining

Don't anything prove front anyone internet especially. prove time, money, etc. prove hate puppies going kill shelters adopting many possible. female posters vent abuse trauma they‚Äôve through. Rather say, men, ask better ally? men care women change world make safer you

No. man said hated women woman raped him, say ""how help overcome trauma?"" I'd say ""that sucks, feel you, saying shit help"".

I ally much me. means happy conversation you, respect opinions, see ally.  wouldn‚Äôt assume overcounting, using misclassified death push narrative deaths aren‚Äôt counted properly can‚Äôt trusted. lol, what? couldn‚Äôt count many times article said ‚Äòthere‚Äôs data support‚Äô &lt; Judge Mary Ellen Brennan found girl ""guilty failure submit schoolwork getting school""

One assignment balance school year? every person dies, 19 survived. 
 
Out 19, 18 suffer long-term heart damage.

Out 19, 2 suffer long-term neurological damage.  
 
Focusing solely deaths missing large part horrific damage virus cause decades. Survivors deal after-effects rest lives.  
 
I fear year's flu season starts ramp towards end year, survivors ""ground glass"" lungs handle it.... saying states virus contained (ex: NJ, CT), would safe reopen schools, states ongoing outbreaks (ex: FL, CA)? Even newer cars today tracking service built in. wife noticed disclaimer RAV Camry says location data monitored transmitted ""research purposes"" feel way you. use phone give directions. shopping phone. government wants know lot different ways small chip mask. Yeah, reading state guidelines OSHA back March realizing going much help rate going. Shame still way too.

Has anyone read CDC guidelines cleaning shared vehicles like cabs? would consider well thought OSHA even enforce that.

Hell, pre-covid way too. least certain states financially conservative policy wise businesses. shut socialization argument down. limited infection control measures schools able mean responsible teachers‚Äô classrooms silent study halls. Since COVID airborne, it‚Äôs higher risk students teachers talk. It‚Äôs also difficult project layers PPE teachers need wear chance contracting mild case. lowest risk in-person model would students working online platform watching recorded video lectures. productivity, productivity expense consideration humanity. Every department manager wishes could replace employees robot slaves. could predict future would become rich man.

Personally, believe sometime next spring, vaccines start available life slowly go back normal. going extremely high demand low supply, believe people US fully vaccinated fall so. 

But then, going keep seeing long wave coronavirus hit country. 3 million cases many cases caught detected, estimate 20 30 million infected far, means coronavirus could keep finding victims time come. ? anyone jumps in, nothing like ""pox parties"" parents chicken pox vaccine existed. fucking around highly contagious disease unknown side effects. TSA.. mean guess.. use gloves full cavity search. You‚Äôre missing one major inconvenience: breathing Supporting jailing black child missed homework seems little bit Klanny maybe wait till jail arab kid white kid homework check response 

Wait sorry, half Arab white kid. Maybe he'll care point, presume everyone send tests states? Welcome America Sure, I'm gonna sit anywhere front chit chat meandering cul de sac. systematically dismantled past years. plan privatize them. Real big brain energy one since even know immunity exists. 

Also recent piece doctor saying started observing lung damage children total asymptomatics.  Orange beach huge vacation spot. Residents certainly help, recent experience, seeing ""out towners"" ""in towners"" parking lots jam packed restaurants. Yeah, need ""bite"". city max $1000 fine it. 99.999% people wearing them. effective. Death isn‚Äôt negative outcome. I‚Äôll interested see morbidity rates, especially information emerges long term effects virus  LOL

I love it. important reminder guilt could carry life may take inadvertently. Killy Mouse overall death rate useless stat. $$$$ try Huntington.

Hell, probably double money amount dumbassed jackasses arrest taking drunken swipes cops trying enforce it. I'm taking away BLM march, opposed graduation procession, likelihood infection would lower?  


Just trying understand medical difference here. definitely *looks* exactly would expect herd immunity look like. NY. "" Science education make country thrive."" -Chinese grade 7 textbook. Apparently science stand way anything Chinese. look dumbwits tourists Mallorca local Spanish government close bars Germans people UK partying like Corona locals frankly scared become quarantine zone that. limit grow up, result early deaths 30's 40's.

Okay look, disease problem children going back school, statement baseless fearmongering. Long term effects, far know right now, seem correlated severity, severity COVID-19 correlated age.

While absolutely may effects development, nowhere near enough evidence make claim, ""It limit grow up, result early deaths 30's 40's."" read ago someone said started evolution contradicting religion got control there. sure exactly happened makes sense. lot going on. guy '30' posted social media hoax actually late 30s according obituary.

I mind scares people behaving hopefully also feels like attempt dramatise pushing age down. Like Obama called ""man Chicago"" Michael Jordan documentary post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Another thing super annoying lists western countries opening schools right issues. open ours. Uh, countries global epicenter virus, scale data collected going lead mistakes. inevitable. best hope provide accurate snapshot time possible. find mistakes young man's case need correct transparent possible. Unfortunately, deniers use story try extrapolate cause doubt entire dataset. going ignore attractive chick thumbnail is?! troll. want people admit isnt law, care kids really wait know immune systems (antibodies, Cells, B Cells) interact Coronavirus talk herd immunity viable scenario.

Also, it‚Äôs never good idea intentionally infect people pandemic virus reason. Hopefully back normal part. vaccine hopefully well better treatments. really isnt test paid NBA private lab. want premium pay premium.  long he's making money it, president ever, money base figure cesspool let in.

Fuck anti science pieces shit accuse racist? dont agree doesnt make racist. never said anything would imply racist. growing lockdowns excessive also forged tools cheap point-scoring politicians, rather tools necessity administered impartially public-health experts. 

I don‚Äôt know anyone say straight face US went far lockdowns. We‚Äôve watching evidence pile real time half assed ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù lot states nowhere near enough. This, unprecedented times country looking best interests short-term long. Murderers. True, dont know yet. thing ridiculous Trump could taken hard line making sure states stay closed, rigorous testing, everyone required wear masks. supports would largely fine follow whatever says anyway. detractors would hard time criticizing since would following lead doctors countries successful. understand world wide tragedy, world leader doesn‚Äôt care anything getting re-elected, it‚Äôs kind softball far national emergencies go. Soylent Green flavored hummus lot people even realize live neighborhood LA City ""City"" Van Nuys something. posted last week. share again? world thinks Americans assholes. 

Not us like this, loudest obnoxious certainly are. Tell friend. moment trying keep employees employed. rent office use. Customers paying time. think going get raise? I'm busting ass keep employed. I'm scum right. huge disconnect. true. Maybe shut office lay employees? better solution. Played Russian roulette . Lost! course, probably going say ""those REAL socialists""...right? Well, ask you, people started blank slate followed directions, REAL socialism?

Answer question. highly doubt mask. could touching something anything else outdoor transmission happen easily indoor transmission? protesters wore masks?

That said, say protests led people congregating contexts though. There's also fact really correct stat. tested 100% population factoring people tested positive died. numbers would surely smaller factor asymptomatic carriers never even get sick enough need tested get sick enough felt needed anything get tested. endpoint seriously would .... Ring, ring, bring dead filled body bags streets mass graves. hospital system crashes game over, seriously. people saying reopen schools still zoom calls work home. I'm tired seeing ""It 99% survival rate! Stop living fear, sheep!"" comments state's Facebook posts masks essentially that, except insulting half time.

People survive necessarily make full recovery. People make full recovery necessarily without pain suffering.

Ugh. true they'll anything clicks found case lighter they're used to, even though understand agree added info headline still article. That's what's backwards this. hired execs massive compensation packages lead company success. execs failed, company paying even try fix mistakes.

It almost feels like hiring dentist fix teeth instead eff teeth know extent messed pay even salvage what's left. dentist go thing others reap $$$. attendee chicken pox party, confirm pretty fucking stupid. industry deals particle containment would ""better nothing"" acceptable OSHA.

On job site deals this, someone wearing passes 90% masks worn would fined tossed site. 

This OSHA getting involved. *did* get involved, one would happy cloth $2 paper masks would required replaced $100 p100 mask. 40% refuse take disappointing. isn‚Äôt chicken pox. trump's America. That's problem young brain. real happens you. might register close friends, acquaintances. Umm... pretty simple, culture respect, wearing masks already acceptable way even started, course gonna able get hold virus, US always individualism, working hard leads american dream. That's 1,111 cases comma countries. repeatedly stated sign coronavirus relief bill include blanket immunity coronavirus lawsuits businesses. recently even hinted ""gross negligence"" sort would allow business sued damages. stupidly high bar set workers receive compensation put harm's way. Mitch owned special interests, domestic, foreign, representing people elected him. people Kentucky see now, good riddance Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn working measure included GOP-only virus relief package could released next week. opening negotiations Democrats legislation bolster economy, hobbled continuing spread coronavirus.

The legislation, top priority Senate GOP leader, would temporarily give businesses, schools, colleges, charities organizations shield lawsuits long make ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù efforts follow public health guidelines didn‚Äôt commit act ‚Äúgross negligence‚Äù ‚Äúintentional misconduct,‚Äù according summary."" poor old minority groups also suceptible.... therein lies confusion Unions got greedy corrupt.  Yup. like climate change, gun control, universal healthcare. 

These ideas engrained dna. head? whole epidemic costly. Maybe stop insulting people seem eager conversations with. crazy numbers. Michigan starting see uptick 600 800 days people panicking numbers. 11,000 cases one day entire state would completely locked hardcore. Florida business usual? Yeah osha untidy work spaces though  Teens don‚Äôt political convictions üôÑ

This virus preys stupid. So, no, diagnosed ADHD. There's lot overlap anxiety depression symptoms ADHD, mean ADHD. Even did, still able say ADHD manifests way girl article's symptoms do. rest piss, shitbag State house part prevents comparable scenario? 

You see hundreds heavily armed protestors government land protesting see injustice police allowed peacefully demonstrate similar? Seems oddly alike Covid19 spreads aerosolized microscopic droplets water produce, virus particles them. droplets created breathe, talk, eat, sneeze, cough, etc. one else around, droplets suspended air time eventually fall ground harmlessly.

The masks physical barrier prevents droplets traveling far fall. about. increases chance droplets produce fall harmlessly around you, rather traveling far enough go someone else's lungs eyes.

Your mask protect much, people wearing masks protects limiting far propel droplets.

When multiply impact hundreds millions adults wearing them, makes big difference severity spread.

That's man, conspiracy. physical barrier limit distance droplets travel. anybody read article? ""Headache"" included list neurological problems. think title bit stretch. Sounds like rest family taking seriously begged same, wanted went friends later tested positive.

This level Scooby Doo mystery. crashing feature bug. 20 years? states forgot soon New York's numbers stopped trending Lol exactly well shit looks like new york city fucked real solution global workers' union. need group that's bigger wealth inheritors sabotaging governments. union go every government fix them. can't inheritors global multi-ethnic working together. 

the whole bringing multi-regional applications really prevent people different backgrounds interacting possibly forming global multi-ethnic workers' union. 

until group bigger multi-ethnic group inheritors controlling everything, always mercy. live heavily red area first time I've seen sort dissent anything within ranks. Two months ago nothing nonsense election year hoax flu. pretty much everybody knows somebody bad one well known docs 40's life support people started come around. still anti mask true believers saner ones finally getting board we're hit hard. read article? ADHD. Maybe neurotypical simple choosing whether not, someone executive function problems becomes matter choice matter much support have. support cut matters outside control, predictably slipped, punished it. like blaming diabetic high blood sugar taking away insulin. 100% happened California. need start focusing large percentage seem recovering long term issues rather simply deaths. message young people need get. far invulnerable. may die, may become chronically sick long long time. NC man insects bigger average beer belly need invest educations. Americans getting dumber dumber generation. Density nothing many deaths they‚Äôll see end. It‚Äôll spread slower less dense areas, it‚Äôll still get every corner US fine. lot areas aren‚Äôt taking stop getting hand. Satan gets bad wrap, churches following Jesus half decent others church Satan, world would much better place everyone. see NBA much luck season. Close contact indoors recipe COVID. Reinfections happen diseases people generally immunity (eg chickenpox)

If you‚Äôre trying say immunity chickenpox, you‚Äôre objectively wrong.  depends side political aisle fall. too. can't figure places biggest protests smallest numbers right now. agree wear mask sign, covid one pointing dead deer make sense. would better sign like ""death everywhere"" next dead deer (since can't use human corpses.) along wear mask sign might trigger good psychological response morons heads. Death motivator. 

Actually, schools reopen month, maybe actual human corpses piling side road october. time horrifying Halloween yet. That's really even enough either, people making 15/hr pull double shifts make rent feed themselves. that's kids, they're screwed. Minimum wage needs livable wage without work unhealthy amounts hours homeless. Brian Kemp wants constituents die Wear condom holes. screen door submarine. administrations entire MO shutting squeezing regulations make easier corporations make money fast easy. obvious cost everything else sun.

Your Feudal Lord takes cut get business Dianne Fienstein.

And Im sadly impass.

On one hand, fuck shit states refuse push mandatory mask.

On hand, plenty people best safe live said shit states.. way spins things kind think sort evil genius happen know answer first question, whether known pathogens thay spread adults children? I'm curious also. Well couple weeks 100k days we‚Äôll herd immunity Darwin work. depends.

 may need driver. may able park walk away, change security uniform, walk back hop in. Maybe nobody watching all, know? guess knowing consequences caught could help determine precautions feel need take.

Trucks could outfitted quickly vans buses everyone using. keep dirty outside, worn, company logo company exist it. Yeah, 40% probably fair, department store breakeven price. love clearance racks 60-90% deals, point like shopping Ross/TJ Maxx place, might well go actual Ross/TJ Maxx place stuff. shopped Kohl's years finally closed unused credit card. refreshing feeling, like closing book putting back shelf, haha. yet still opening schools CA, woman?

How witchy warn people? happened. Young people need wary decisions carry affect people lives. course OSHA AWOL. OSHA can't enforce workplace COVID standards, federal standard requirements COVID prevention workplace. were, OSHA would still enforce it, would undermine Trumps insistence everything open go back normal.  Moving along Gompertz curve like NY, Lombardy, Sweden, People often hard time admit serious mistakes. Help understand reasoning

 - assessment individual risk level?
 - assessment perceived tribe?

Or get wrong?

The virus hits poor people (and specific types jobs) harder, cannot avoid exposure.

Minorities higher percentage poor comparison population numbers. US ""latinas"" 31% poor, ""blacks"" (if politically correct term days) 35% poor ""whites"" 11% poor. 

That means US, approx:

 - 16 million poor ""latinas""
 - 12.9mil poor ""blacks""
 - 21.5 mil poor ""whites""

Giving 50million poor help ...would costly. 

If one could turn two groups biggest group pay help two groups, one would save TON cash, literally, TON üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏

Ya know US always willing jump country's affairs help fix them?

I think time rest world turn begin descent new Trump era economic depression.

For every person virus kills, cripple several. majority severe cases never rejoining work forces, still fed, clothed, sheltered. 

When studies based upon 6 12 month follow appointments people ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù March April published, discover absolutely terrifying percentage mild cases endowed kinds lifelong health problems, accompanying absolutely catastrophic reductions quality life.

The economic fallout orders magnitude worse effects paying county stay home order contain outbreak. healthy, fit, young dude late 20s, Ima going say ""no thanks"" virus matter what.

Besides fact selfish asshole going wear mask and/or take precautions going spread others. still little data take virus seriously. First all, Dr. Fauci said, always outliers. cases healthy person would react badly virus ended dropping dead. healthy young 100% guaranteed survive. Second, recovering process extremely draining painful even healthy. That's gonna dawg. Lastly, pertaining thread, know long-lasting health issues virus might cause even recovered. Again, know little even year yet. Cancer develop years later, knows virus cause road. find useful scale relative things know, people understand scale it. that's OK.

For example: Reported US Covid deaths running two September 11 attacks per week. 2-3 Boeing 747 MAX8 crashes per day. 4 times deaths per day World War II. Benghazi attack every 8 minutes, 24 hours day.

You might find metrics useful, appreciate them. promise: someone does. as? know symptoms manifest way symptoms, exactly? Colorado it? per capita, Alaska got 52 cases, per capita that's still 8x worse canada

So, one stylist infected even though wore masks!


**So, one stylist infected even though wore masks!** assumption, co-workers wore masks around customers, 100% time (and again, ignoring time together aspect masks 100%). used assumption say CDC piece contradicted itself. 

Masks never 100%. one trying push use reducing infection spread directly contrary experts know you.

We know don‚Äôt one.  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial symptomatic outpatient adults probable confirmed early COVID-19, 5-day course hydroxychloroquine **failed show substantial clinical benefit** improving rate resolution COVID-19 symptoms enrolled clinical trial participants. receiving placebo, 70% reported COVID-19 symptoms day 14 study, 96% hospitalized, 99.6% survived. change symptom severity statistically significant: **12% relative improvement placebo**. comparison, oseltamivir influenza showed 25% 35% relative reduction symptom severity score clinical trials Therefore, modest clinical effect practitioners ascribe oseltamivir still twofold greater observed hydroxychloroquine.

The author's describe failure HCQ significant clinical benefit non-hospitalized patients early COVID-19, mention 12% ""relative"" improvement placebo. Whether that's clinically relevant hard say given significant toxicities HCQ. 1/10 people subjectively helped, risks taking drug high, worth it? I'll leave opinions guys!

Well dang already taking Vitamin melatonin due normal american mess! Sweet! seven year old üòÇüòÇüòÇ 14.7% March 11.7% June. It‚Äôs fact unemployment rates dropping. 

Try please. argument benefit extended.  HAIIYOOO!! trump gets reelected Exactly. described government. government gives it. really wish Good you. I‚Äôve never seen that. Maybe get first. people thinking distancing measures pointless 128 people died. think it‚Äôs low number shouldn‚Äôt anything. It‚Äôs illogical - didn‚Äôt anything number would much higher. 128 number doesn‚Äôt apply situation didn‚Äôt anything distancing measures. It‚Äôs crazy keep thinking way. serious- generally decision would need made relatives care deceased. there's process death country involves investigations, determining cause death, issuing death certificates needed close departed's estate.

In lot cases influx bodies well disruption normal systems things causes large backlog. would course disrespectful leave bodies sitting heat decompose rot waiting funeral home able take body, forensic pathologist examine it, etc. body preserved things respect. School Boards can't planning. get ask administration plan try figure pay it. can't. can't pay socially distant busing. can't pay socially distant classes. nothing done stop student teachers getting infected school, minimize spread much afford to. school, turns much. 

So I'm going blame boards. I'm going blame administrators understand science asked solve puzzle solution. I'm going blame teachers faced impossible choices.

I instead blame government unwilling pay short, sharp price lockdown. I'll blame states allowed thing resurge knew better. United stand, divided fall. 

If people want schools able reopen, stay home. can't, wear mask. solution. judge must autistic boomer , though nowadays thing. imagine sarcastic. changing anything better. dragging feet yet every step way. words little actual action. 

She's upgrade Brandstadt man POS. You‚Äôre angry death cult fantasies aren‚Äôt coming true. You‚Äôre reported. baseline truth study fake news! 
/s Hes already likely process cooking books Nope, accurate it‚Äôs thinking trying do...

""And Oval talking that,"" said. ""When says open, means open full, kids able attend every day school. science stand way this."" guys compassion others moved virus about? means point infectious , openly defying mask orders. dangerous state. 
In Midwest still don‚Äôt wear masks all. I'm fully supportive unemployment. understand pandemic extra $600/week granted? I'm hoping ensure families could reasonably pay rent, medical, food, etc.

This also tells need $600/week realized, temporary? Doctors? Fake news! /s  Muh roads. standards practice governemt codified them. like government discovered make make structurally sound buildings, private market. someone refuses wear mask call cops tell want trespassed. gets around cop trying say don‚Äôt want enforce it. Yes do.

Just like private restaurants follow public health regulations.

Government laws apply private citizens, otherwise laws, they're internal policies. Thank pictures head face eaters would explain lot... village near hometown killed ate wheat mushroom (same lsd) thought possesd devil (in medieval times) explanation makes sense. That‚Äôs right. Whooooooooosh. bit clever me! Thank  It‚Äôs 1000% sure happening people actually know things saying statements. can't believe country come to. I'm legitimately embarrassed living US... Russian confirm, country authoritarian forced wear masks gloves go store.

Oh wait, laws exist paper, literally one follows literally one gives shit. authoritarian country are, able willing enforce basic pandemic laws. Literally less authoritarian puritan holier-than-thou western liberals (and case, bad way).

Also something something London US cities surveillance per capita Chinese metropolises... do? Honestly, teachers change rooms every period. Keep kids room day. That‚Äôs basically goes Japanese schools. It‚Äôs still putting teachers risk, WOULD lessen it. 

Ideally wouldn‚Äôt going back November, but... I‚Äôm aware process works. Haha sorry yeah ment miles. I'm reading thousand smiles way trying figure means. 

I miss lot lately handle risk getting sick. Hey millennials! YOLO also means YODO. south finally people really matter, made name. 'USA',' China', ever.

no, regardless, see people - forget made name. Looking other, terrorizing, throwing cell forgotten. Forcing people adhere unquestionably. sane.

Look others, care - look terrorize hope people suffer. Life world terrible. Luxembourg banned? cells!! Gotta love one Damn nice read. 

If replaced US references European ones, could tell exact story European country. 

Wearing mask seems trivial compared everybody go several months ago, won‚Äôt people understand extremely reasonable price pay maintain kind normalcy save lives. US weird sometimes. Felon That's fucked tho also nationwide [55mph speed passed 70s (tying compliance federal funding highways). course tyrants still thinking force poverty police state us. administration would ride local authority think defunding schools open person threat. It‚Äôll extended lower payment. ruling class cares much get away immiserating workers There‚Äôs many ways measure COVID deaths. 

The UK (England specifically) definitely foolish counting deaths people hit buses died totally unrelated causes months positive test COVID deaths. 

Many people suggest using Excess Deaths. It‚Äôs useful way compare countries see real impact virus nation directly indirectly. comes issue, stop counting them. last 3 weeks UK seen weekly deaths drop 5 year average. mean start counting backwards? many people gleefully claiming UK suffered 65,000 deaths one point, excess deaths 60,000 year. number might well continue drop people would died say August don‚Äôt die, died March. Think it, everyone must die changing week death registered in. 

So better? Deaths directly caused COVID? Deaths feature COVID cause directly indirectly? excess deaths? one either flawed, fails paint complete picture. Cognitive dissonance. I‚Äôve meds regularly since 2016 things notice different life meds long term CRAZY. Learned couple months ago reason massive sweet tooth faded craving sweets dopamine, got meds long term brain didn‚Äôt need boost stopped eating sweets almost entirely ü•¥

Missing day meds like brain death sentence cuz withdrawals bad, even without withdrawals barely recognize person meds. much louder Olympic level hyperfocus sessions lmao. cannot IMAGINE ever going meds knowing much mess life them

Meds something walk lot knowledge imo, def aren‚Äôt everyone personally trade dry mouth increased heart rate vs flunking college contest. even see people taking meds cuz HARD anything pharmacies doctors offices. moved Texas call 3 different places multiple times day half week could get records transferred prescription sent pharmacy.

... SARS (as SARS 1) infected less 10k killed less 1k worldwide? getting confused swine flu?  Yes no. state relies both, California cities counties starving right rely sales taxes. lol recommended Nah pres said testin' Unemployment dropping, people wont go back work make laid collecting 600$. That's fact.

Needs end, never going go forever. That's impossible, never end solution. federal government parents supporting us throughout lives neither tax paying citizens. I'm afraid going get whole lot worse gets better.  well numbers said, like afraid take decisive action. nursing home near live fully half residents positive now, staff afraid come work board directors put call office guidance. dont know thought going do--but done nothing help situation nursing home still thinks okay schedule show exactly half hour short hours they'd need qualify heroes/hardship bonus. supposed fifty dollars every four hours worked. friend told they've scheduling 3.5 hours weeks end now.  mean, much lower sink? Physics merely mathematics applied real world, shapes involved QUADRUPLE JENGA, INTEGRATIONIST Ah yes Reddit consensus tons white conservatives would love vote Democrats supported shitty positions Republicans. works! Shred documents. known ways stimulate melatonin production, none dramatic smoking marijuana.*

Amazing news. condone smoking sick, vaporizing edibles healthier alternative live legal state. still substantially better US. Even per 1m. saying something. wrong. making sure kids got diseases young unlikely serious side-effects, get adults. Chicken pox dangerous adults.

The big difference corona probably give life long immunity really know kids okay long-term side-effects. Texas: hot cool! Torronoto Montreal Vancouver 24% Canadian population. Vancouver 600k people. three Toronto remotely serious mass transit system.

Most Canadians live near us boarder, quite rural spaced out. Calgary Edmonton larger populations Vancouver, pretty dispersed. Alberta massive. Put fire first.  Yes bc men say kind shit time women understand men say actually mean ""all women"" empathetic experience. 

Also, I'm pretty sure several subreddits publish women slaves be, posting pretty gnarly images tied violently abused women men masturbate yet go unpunished so... *shrugs*

I think handle little constructive criticism feminist rant respond incorrectly victim. 


Also, pretty sure guy see responded example respond female victims. many people Texas die year flu? always someone else's fault bad things happen Everything's bigger Texas! understand decision based preliminary data cases absolute lowest worldwide among children 7 under. also phonics instruction, behavioral/maturity ability so. make good points. don‚Äôt think mentioned many parents work cannot home supervise young and/or special needs student day. kindergartener alone 8 hours day needs hands supervision complete school work. Special needs students ages may also need supervision school work.

Some kids also shitty home environments.

No one answer questions. solutions issues school virtual. Last heard big counties full, overall state 70 percent absolutely terrifying realize US slammed brakes today, cases would continue increase current pace least 2 weeks, deaths would continue least 4 weeks. even terrifying realize 0% chance US actually slamming brakes time soon. starting look like high school math problem. flew FL Disney week closed. Prior going much talk state side cases, blew next week. Cases reporting single digits decided still go. ones practically whole park wearing masks using hand sanitizer touching anything. consistently stupid. prefer countries downplayed first change strategy thereafter. God knows many deaths would UK (and rest Europe) without lockdown. Crazy ground zero get *one* island. 

We ones! wholesome response ‚ù§Ô∏è truly confirmed either way. Notes going dormant theory **reactivation.** Also says 'days later'. want see evidence someone clearing virus, getting sick say 3-5 months later.... Probably trumps first choice then. local Illinois Walgreens requiring masks now, though may state, county, and/or local orders. Tell people make decisions need wear mask outside near anyone. even possibility encountering others would keep one around neck though case anyone started get close. would probably keep mask whole time place like busy park woods like hiking trail. ~~brain~~ mask police? week alone, 6000 Americans perished Covid19.

We owe them, loved ones, wear mask memory remind us duty Americans stand one another look persons immediate community.

You don‚Äôt enforce rules, ask every American can, simple thing wearing mask, make great deal difference American haven‚Äôt yet met. People legit pulling guns mask thing crazy curious, Arizonagreg...do wear mask? teacher, sad laugh this.  That‚Äôs legal system laws operate.

You receive citation(s). 30 days pay fine(s) contest citation(s). contest hearing day/time set. Sometimes person, sometimes online. choice. dissatisfied ruling file appeal within 30 days ruling issued. Paying fine admission guilt. guilty must contest court. 

So that‚Äôs proper, responsible way handle it. don‚Äôt pay contest it, ignore it, get bench warrant arrest. Typically go radar multiple citations add it‚Äôs worth time/effort bring in. judge issues bench warrant issuing warrant arrest appear front courts. arresting citations, arrested failing appear start. arrest ordered court lifted court. LEOs obligated arrest anyone knowingly come contact bench warrant issued arrest. 

So doesn‚Äôt sound like Texas arresting people using masks.  oh yes...""that"" time year again...

For lot folks lots fun! Go Scuba 11:30pm, Surface earlier 12:01 catch. Celebrate catch fellow divers within close confines boat...party friends family relatively close confines keys offer --- got yerself nice petri dish...  would've thought? stop stuff going kill people first. Finally! Right mouth por favor. would nice student loan forgiveness 

I'm hoping address point. I'm 40k debt attending university got *one* full semester in-person education. Shit sucks man. ""With press button, guests misted 10-secconds chlorine-based disinfectant Vale says safe skin. Customers choose use portal asked keep mouths eyes closed misting.

Zepeda says portal ""kills germs even come in."" said he's seen guests getting quick cleaning way out, too."" that.... functioning society. Insomnia finally useful. Trump started one war: war American People Constitution Unitied States. 

That one war plenty. pretty massive manufacturing distribution deals made preparation vaccines approved

Can't grab links second easily googlable 

The nice thing point need EVERYONE vaccinated stop hurting us. Mith moderate social distancing mask wearing crowded / indoor areas, R value seem really go 1.3 tops (using places mask mandates *real* closings example)
50% people vaccinated cuts *effective* R probably closer 0.7 would mean virus dies slowly probably never see sustained increase cases

I #believe
Gonna suck till tho
I miss going places probably happened US too. facility hit HARD couple times shit fucking grim. actually resources too, can‚Äôt imagine smaller places. People like Kemp DeSantis prison this.  really, say numbers consistent allegations, although think allegations somehow germane, also know irrelevant data supports Jones. Swedish government let pioneered path death. way. choice. No, much proud all. Meta analysis double blind, randomized control trials published peer-reviewed journals outweighs non-peer reviewed letters editor. 

It's theoretical paper. actual meta-analysis would get data, i.e. ""In 1000 pts receiving melatonin viral infections, 80% improved faster compared receiving placebo"" like. 
 
Your argument akin saying blog post state legislation. Again, check wreck yourself. mean, 15k 11.5k isn‚Äôt outside normal bounds variability take account availability taking swabs testing swabs. 

I think takeaway we‚Äôre debating whether 11,500 cases Florida ‚Äúgood news‚Äù compared 15,000 cases. I'm talking degree protection simple cloth mask offers wearer. also social distance, wash hands etc. Ideally we'd n95s equivalent actually effective protecting wearer well others around them. real fucking shame too. idiot convene team experts drive policy, create plan, coordinate resources. 

If Trump offloaded panel experts shut fuck up, response would perfect (or least good experts panel).

Instead, narcissistic ego, input middle fuck up. Nobody expects president answers, expect get people one room (err... zoom call lol). afraid understand we're dealing with. least sort cure.

I mean, let kids school without vaccines diseases. Yet disease cure, understand well, let's put kids together see happens. WTF. 

Using schools science experiment really really really (did say really?) bad idea. take two brain cells figure out. Thanks, helpful. Even normal day, scientific studies exercise nuance context. ability vet data lot work itself.

The pandemic made less less tolerant conspiracy theories, disinformation alt facts. politicization nowadays, comes that. still poke head spaces check latest narrative is. Often, granule truth mountain bullshit. Goddamn incredibly sad. feel defeated individual knowing call reps.. feeling won‚Äôt see true devastation decisions way virus passed. really hope make November vote Reynolds out. decision strip unemployment benefits people choosing go back lower paying job also gross revelation thinks working class people. won‚Äôt let us protect ourselves, nothing help us. Oh, right!!!!

Thank correction, I'll update comment edit. rigged election. I‚Äôm local police already said they‚Äôre going enforce that. somewhere report specific local business following state wide mask mandate goes effect like two days? report local police station anyone?? hope town?  Oh exposing child freezing temperatures inconvenience assumingly taking shoes young know back on. hey good job man karen. Knowledge stand way ignorance. else would expect announce release state-affiliated pharma company media agency state? reason came mind mayor said: ""Hospitals ability add hundreds ICU beds,"" says discontinuing elective surgeries converting recovery rooms ICU rooms.

I guess wondering whether line people waiting electives turn away. Brave folk. Hire bouncers furloughed bars. Oida, versteht di' kanna. People say ‚Äúend pandemic‚Äù ever totally go away. We‚Äôre going live forever. new normal. NEVER ‚Äúokay cool everything cool go back exactly pre pandemic.‚Äù obvious. People killing wearing/not wearing face masks. honestly think point everyone joking going remove face masks shake hands? 

Also fact LOT people making unemployed 600$ benefit compared made pre pandemic. inject Belgian beer. Look social media playing violin. It‚Äôs filled horse shit like transphobic. contribution you‚Äôre going miss? stores considered private businesses private property, pull guns antimaskers trespassing? Well, I'd assume surges Jul 4th needed celebrations. So, keep fingers crossed numbers soon go little. parent believes kid EVER grown up. I'm 32, 30,000 savings account, investing some, 1,000 ""every day"" fund times...paid dream car, 2004 audi a6 2.7t outright cash, seriously well...have debt, loans, responsible manage life well...and still treat like child lol.

it never stops California reopen schools fall. fear economic consequences?

Make mistake, cowardly move judge issues bench warrant. one actively come looking you. next traffic stop run law enforcement agency within state take custody. post bail get new court date remain jail court date. appears Texas, according arrest someone refuse can‚Äôt pay excessive fine face mask.

Most likely states would send collections and/or suspend driver‚Äôs licenses. can‚Äôt see states waisting resources issue, even anything. make claim, go ahead back up. completely agree. feel endangered living neighboring state. Lots visitors GA every day. ‚ÄúYou either put mask get fuck out, choice.‚Äù

These giant companies don‚Äôt need business loser won‚Äôt wear mask upon request. They‚Äôll fine. yes security armed. Checks balances... balanced fair system... could never get hand /s First one's almost free, kid. heard non-union shoots happening vast majority shoots either moving States working. network told us work likely resuming year. Cool thing. I'm going say something depressing. ever proof there's point data people incapable action, right now. Yeah did! impressive! move italy? coffee Interesting point, yeah. token could tie mask mandate law onto relief funding bill, entire bill blocked senate small item. People congress want pass relief bill know need economy collapse, ones really care problem holding entire thing hostage small item like ""masks"" ""not able sue anyone actions causing death relative"". I‚Äôm third world citizen, too. U.S. citizen. study effectiveness reducing particulates air cough/sneeze using masks, hand, tissue sleeve. 

The sleeve least effective. Right behind mask showing little difference. Pulling ahead coughing hand (wash please!!). effective particulate blocker tissue.

Unfortunately, study used surgical masks N95 better. Cloths face would fare much worse due larger openings filter.

I'm saying wearing mask NOTHING agreeing CDC's research NOTHING SIGNIFICANT. Again, interchange flu virus Covid-19 virus similar size transmission methods. She‚Äôs making claims, she‚Äôs questioning people aren‚Äôt following advice given medical experts / CDC. you‚Äôre going attack celebrity culture, example make. better vaccine chicken pox though getting chicken pox childhood puts risk shingles adulthood spent last four months actually working control spread virus would fine how! ain't gonna let virus tell us ya see? virus destroy cells ?

*suppressed laughter*

There thousands scientists saying real chance good vaccine redditors say CELL that's choice. 

I full right point virus destroy cells, literally do. 

People asked post links prove happened google pull first link Google list.

So mean wrong virus destroy cells?

You go take cold shower. Want cheese whine? thats ""fact"" please tell us many people turned jobs still collecting unemployment... I'll wait.  


In case want work, here's light reading you.  Sounds like douchebag begin with. Instructions unclear, boofed burns. Also, part (yeah part) stuck peroxide bottle. *could* write thought-out post forms neurodivergence treated various character flaws throughout history better understood learn, try nice day instead. üëç Including fear losing next election. I‚Äôd love get $600 week plus state benefits backpack west US run out. Could come home buy new Tacoma Oh yes, thought that? parents going back work. states poorly comparison us curse ways ""americans coming fucking shit up""

Thankfully havent noticed much antimask sentiment city, theres definitely bit ""oh well look bad US doing, relax bit arent inept""

Then sudden, we're level. right, fixed it. tried home energy assistance program? definitely help used past.  happen live city Corona, California, you? Corona TV local public access station there. Otherwise, I'm unable find search. still pay back student loans lmao fuck gay earth. think scientists guilty that, media. always question impact protests would have. Turns out, much outdoors, many people masked. Weird long California wasn‚Äôt even list. per capita numbers really put perspective. That's lot. I'm going blame administrators understand science asked solve puzzle solution.

I think that's problem SD, Admin seems ones ignorant science. Unless literally pay attention anything medical, would know masks always effective prevent spread disease. wrong sir..  much alcohol probably bad...

But signs CBD might helpful reasons melatonin. wait til FL gets headline

shit....  Yeah really fucked long term care facilities Canada (most deaths come facilities)

That seems case countries. old weak die first death rates starts dropping radically. surprising really shows fallacy looking spread virus (or virus, really) magnifying glass. temporary federal government thought virus would control economy would V shape recovery. That‚Äôs clearly happening planned though. mean, put fire, think keep learning online, right? improve curriculum? solve problem supervision? grading attendance?  I‚Äôm sick tired people celebrating mans death claiming motivated empathy.

No, you‚Äôre fucking sociopaths Rolling sleeves, eh? That‚Äôll show crummy virus for! place discussion, pretty much r/politics covid articles. Anyone healthcare industry understands ton non covid deaths ate recorded covid, one cares. Pop another thread, say nothing noteworthy except blame things Republicans 40 upvotes instead downvotes. 

The Corona virus subreddits much informative open discussion. science side. false equivalency compare united states, averaging around 170 new coronavus cases day, per million, much densely populated EU, averaging 9 new cases per day, per million.

It's also fair compare Trump administration's wish every child school, 5 days week EU model reduced class sizes kids going school twice week.

The science clearly Trump administration's plane open schools execution plan would allow virus spread even currently is. much obvious Trump Administration's failed attempt get CDC change assessment schools reopen Trump's administration's decision bypass CDC reporting coronavirus cases. 

The science clearly Trump administration simply saying make statement reasonable. actually source study showing masks reduce COVID-19 transmission? months research coming I've seen one study supports claim, quite support opposite.

Even early pandemic lots studies indicating even basic masks reduce viral transmission, example [here materials used make homemade masks, shows even cotton fabric cut t-shirts (top row table) filters bacteriophage MS-2 particles (size ~25nm) least half, SARS-CoV-2 virions 2-4x size MS-2 (50-200nm). plenty research filtration efficiency large population studies backing claim masks reduce viral transmission. employing already?0 ^^^ Yep, right here. ^^^ really sucks Bay Area pretty good job first time, LA rest sunbelt let run wild everyone admirable job fucked everyone else. boss's niece's classmates school covid didnt listen hungout together went parties shit. tested positive. impression fake news ""when kid can't get it"". 

she smart one laying low playing safe...but 2 kids it, spread 40 others. 42 school :/ government actually reversed law previous year ""decriminalized"" domestic violence - outcry conservative groups, many judges simply enforce law acquitted people, whereas revised law enforced lot automatic jail sentence.

It's screwed-up situation, Western headlines.  Employees don‚Äôt pay tax. Employers do. call shutdowns reactions virus ‚Äúthe pandemic‚Äù sure, sounds correct. lot people conflate two. reason politician pander people... **wrong** ‚Äúwith much line,‚Äù hold ineptitude accountable means elective process‚Äî you‚Äôre overlooking fact misstatements, dismissive rhetoric, focus economy, failure support quarantine measures, lack basing policy *on advise expert you‚Äôre blaming* . 

The President didn‚Äôt give Dr. Fauci wheel. gave Pence. Eventually Trump reluctantly let Fauci keep influence committee prescience national stage all. became appearance opinions weren‚Äôt adopted administration. Yes people dumb, I'm tired articles deflecting blame away crappy leadership. fuck kind message supposed take government opening economy, refusing shut issue Statewide mask requirements? Instead, we're getting article article young people feel invincible want party.

How this. stop focussing people fully developed executive function, start focussing people supposed function executives. 40 year old neighbor went away ambulance today 4th July party.

Also:

‚ÄúMelatonin inexpensive, non-toxic wide dose range, long shelf-life **can self-administered** major advantage large numbers individuals involved. Thus, use melatonin mitigate COVID-19 pandemic would feasible socially-responsible measure attempt.‚Äù

Because low oral bioavailability, could one take larger dose? would actually easy affordable, money given need it. republicans want give billions away corporations sponsors giving pittance struggling Americans.

I would add trouble breathing. Speculation: they're trying count now, places, means they're testing deaths counting probables older deaths. 

This happened Colorado May - spike hundreds extra deaths actually happened April.  even that, excess mortality says there's lot deaths know cause of. Excess mortality Texas indicates they're probably undercounting deaths factor two more. Setting fix that, count deaths instead hiding them, one important steps handling pandemic. 17 whoever adult house needs fucking something...... ya winning son? Hey, stop fucking fur farming?

Is safe strike band time coronavirus?

Science's COVID-19 reporting supported Pulitzer Center Heising-Simons Foundation.

As U.S. schools colleges debate reopen amid novel coronavirus pandemic, band directors musicians wondering when‚Äîor whether‚Äîmusic played safely. new study finds musical instruments generate airborne particles could carry SARS-CoV-2, risks performers audience may manageable.

There almost research whether musical instruments produce airborne particles‚Äîor aerosols‚Äîthat transmit novel coronavirus. it‚Äôs impossible know whether keeping 2 meters away enough stay safe trumpet full blast.

Without data, schools already cutting band rehearsals ‚Äúout fear,‚Äù said Mark Spede, president College Band Directors National Association. Given potential threat music education livelihoods musicians around globe, Spede‚Äôs group National Federation High School State Associations raised $275,000 100 arts groups study safety performing pandemic. 

Researchers University Colorado, Boulder, five student musicians‚Äìa soprano singer clarinet, flute, French horn, trumpet players‚Äîenter clean room one time. room normally used indoor air pollution research, outfitted tight seals, multiple high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters remove almost particles air.

The participants performed short solo piece wide range high low notes different styles playing, including smooth chorale staccato march. players angled instruments‚Äô openings toward series tubes feed trio particle monitors detected aerosols different sizes. imaging system also captured airflow around musicians visualize particles moved.

The initial results‚Äîwhich released online week without peer review‚Äîshowed first time instruments produce aerosols range sizes carry COVID-19 virus. aerosols also stay airborne long periods time, different instruments produced different amounts. instance, trumpet clarinet, run straighter mouthpiece instrument opening, higher concentrations aerosols.

To reduce spread aerosols, researchers tested instrument covers, cloth covering opening sack covering entire clarinet; effectively reduced aerosols, cases half, without deadening sound.

Another team University Maryland, College Park, used computer models examine whether infected musician might spread virus different conditions. modeling confirmed importance distancing avoid infected plumes. also suggested conventional ventilation systems, air supply exhaust ceiling, less effective exhaust floor.

The results add recent work airflow instruments. study May Vienna Philharmonic wind string musicians play inhaling mist illuminated headlights exhaled. Another study, conducted spring Germany, tracked air flow wind instruments. found instruments produced less airflow singing (although flutes produced wind instruments).

Bernhard Richter, otolaryngology specialist co-director Freiburg Institute Musicians' Medicine, led German study, says team‚Äôs initial results could inform safety recommendations. says new aerosol work offer even sophisticated data. ‚ÄúWe know enough aerosols ‚Ä¶ critical issue spreading.‚Äù

The researchers behind aerosol study gather data additional instruments, singers, dancers, actors. could give fuller picture potential risks performance improve computer modeling effectiveness distancing air circulation, says Shelly Miller, engineering professor University Colorado, Boulder, helped run study.

Based initial findings, organizations funded study recommend indoor rehearsal rooms performance venues use HEPA filters increase circulation, musicians use instrument covers. also recommend 2 meters distancing performers face direction, could limit band orchestra size.

Miller says hopes data recommendations let band play on. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs heartbreaking halt activities don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre hazardous not.‚Äù  pay consult type lawyer would handle type case. Lawyers take cases commission time. least, America getting started yo Next week 20k cases 300 dead every day? 

It‚Äôs hard believe. actual question, fucking douchebags huntington beach surfers skaters racists believe False. Either reinfections, virus lies dormant re-emerges, leading second illness. assertion ‚Äúwe proven cases reinfection‚Äù misleading best. People getting sick second time, cases, getting much much sicker second time around. damage body appears accumulative patients. go spout feel good fairy tales reddit. anyone read far? guy peddling bullshit soothe anxiety. big molecule H2O compared viruses?

You believe water vapor getting mask ""means something"" covid-19 context. go look difference size make think guesses *just might good* guidance CDC. know that's going go. No! America likes cheap shit! makes great, dammit! shut down. 

This going ugly... It‚Äôs also people like don‚Äôt qualify anything get approved would get 600 Bro rough, im 26 seriously considering filing bankruptcy lost job havent found another one 3 month looking. going hurt lot fucking people. LOL former OC resident really spoke surprise all. DAY ONE!!! link report? time though, we'll *really* give'em fer...just soon we're ventilators, back feet. give minute catch breath. Link working don‚Äôt support schools opened. friends teachers well. 

I didn‚Äôt say *anything* support schools opened. 

I said **this article** didn‚Äôt add information debate. 

I want **good information** support teachers. bullshit incorrect headlines undermine argument lead ‚Äúgotcha!‚Äù soundbites inaccurately quoted. 

You really assumptive. Looking like least 80,000 cases states today now. works? misunderstood issue. 


If vaccine physically made USA think strong chance Trump blocks leaving country insist goes americans first. countries like Britain making Britain elsewhere (not US) run issue. Yep, got turned OCS highschool wrestling injury. Doesn‚Äôt help majority south Leroy Jenkins‚Äôd opening plan. sub really like talk Massachusetts, we're well. Yikes. still cannot fathom people locked accord. area Illinois bad Chicago full throws back April May, still terrified go anywhere. Explain Lawful evil bad look, guy. want say little disappointed someone voted shared facts mostly facts data.

It seems like soon sort feeling issue let cause us incredulous facts less convenient cause. see many conservatives. want economy open reject facts show virus dangerous. someone like wear masks reject facts masks effective reducing transmission.

 want schools open mean would reject data shows Sweden done somewhat successfully. can't allow feelings concerns blind cause biased studies embrace ones reject. 

Sigh.. patrons sit flash light dildo ‚Äúintroduce light body‚Äù ones take live ones refuse die? Sounds like natural selection me. Oh, 'they' again! right, 'they' screwed last time well. Thank God 'we' anything it. Ding ding ding recall earlier pandemic dog confirmed virus. dog sniffing infected people, would reasonable dog could become infected it? infected dog could spread presumably... Gosh, hope thought one through! amount people probably infinitesimally small. trash, stay away  could followed leadership we‚Äôve seen NY! It‚Äôs gonna both. four congresspeople Democrats. sent facility run county. fair, think person hasn‚Äôt said ‚Äújust flu‚Äù all. saying comparing deaths flu seems relevant comparing war events, etc. 

Both comparisons place. 

Comparing deaths flu makes sense another virus, actually shows ‚Äújust flu‚Äù like many people believe. (This something frustrated end beginning people compared yearly flu deaths covid month pandemic, makes intelligent sense all). 

On hand, situation hand pandemic new virus, different existing virus level herd immunity. ‚Äúevent‚Äù sorts understand comparing deaths event events past. 

I guess perhaps best comparison would Spanish flu, also pandemic new virus. would interesting see data different times pandemic restrictions preventative measures place time. saying that, people today weren‚Äôt around Spanish flu less connection compared current events viruses. guys ridiculous.

I fond memories prison. tough first, meeting others locked failing professors' assigned readings, really felt home. wealthy people get bailed out. Look fema paradise fires handled. Time time poor always looked boss also propagating speaking plainly clearly anti-mask idiocy stop Lol what? That‚Äôs narrative came narrative believe? basically factual numbers mean nothing constantly find excuse behind false narrative? God help come winter time. I'd love hear local medical staff get thoughts selfish people are. god smallest class 30 students roster. state stable 50% cases last week wild. bad management america general... CA republican... NY republican... NY sent covid patients nursing homes... fucktard realize children infect families home even lower risk getting seriously ill? outlier among nations ignored science several months, even cherry picking little snippets support absolute ignorance. disgrace humanity.

Edit: whoops, see comment copy-pasted everywhere. Probably russian misinformation troll. Either way US fucked... think natural selection bad? Food already getting expensive people go homeless foodless, there's gonna riots. Wow, quickly normally clear backlog like that? Days? Business Roundtable lobbying federal government since April implement nationwide enforceable policies. never happened, they're own.

Never thought I'd thankful leadership Walmart CEO. trumpateer governor gave speech like pep rally. listening would heard ICU up, ventilator use up, refrigerated trucks coming hold dead.

Instead go history president destroyed country. fear Russian political scientists correct late 90s - said 2030 US fractured 4 5 separate countries. likelihood coming pass skyrocketed first half year...

Post articles Brazil find interesting current ones aren‚Äôt Portuguese. Users upvote content find relevant. Since users US, they‚Äôre likely post content US. 140 thousand deaths are, 100 percent, fault. He's done nothing stop best move killing American children. vaccine didnt provide immunity, short immunity, would researchers still working vaccine.

Because everybody works vaccines around world throwing whatever virus they‚Äôre starting find vaccines work not.

I researcher viral immunology assure vaccine doesn‚Äôt promote long lasting antibodies basically trash. I'm sorry. That's got incredibly frustrating scary. Please know majority people, nationwide, worldwide, wearing masks. right thing, I'm sorry surrounded level ignorance. say this. say, ‚Äúthe science side‚Äù, it‚Äôs quite factually side, you‚Äôre saying science doesn‚Äôt matter. You‚Äôre knowingly lying science... science shouldn‚Äôt stand way. I'm sorry mom dead. Sabatini criticized ‚Äúcareer politicians‚Äù seven-member commission, supporters shouted: ‚ÄúVote out.

I live red district traditionally leaned right, think ones going voted time around anti-maskers. Blue wave happen naturally since none constituents left alive. keeps saying kids cant spread virus? Masks mandated countries Europe. Take look Netherlands, prime minister literally advised called useless, Belgium. Fact remains Covid-19 died countries mask usage never touted mandated (aside public transport). 

Outdoor transmission risk low evidenced indoors faciliating major transmission almost (1300 cases, 1 got ton studies shown outdoor environmental factors bottlenecking transmission, hand find easily google new COVID-19 hospitalizations New York people stayed home, 96% also underlying health issues,""

IFR calculated age taken account: basically 0 Sweden mask wearing never mandated strict lockdown ever occured. Good job bamboozled local news sources despite literature. call others deluded even believe stuff see eyes. Curbside pickup? Walmart, target, large grocers offer it.

Guess that‚Äôs option though reality. look death rates America incredibly stable around 58k month. easily see spike pandemic starts. difference reported covid-19 deaths 58k likely secondary result pandemic. know early studies exact reason. underreported virus cases, sick people's fear hospitals, delays emergency services, due covid calls, worse medical care due overcrowded hospitals, exhausted medical workers, bad medical decisions ( need clear beds Covid send sickly people back home earlier). What?

Tell know coronavirus vaccines rushing production skipping clinical phases. 

It fairly straightforward questions. claimed something, I'm asking prove it. read testosterone effect, higher = deaths, think also happens w/ baldness IIRC... Hey good point. kids love YouTube garbage videos too, think do. Somebody make some. Governor stonewalling... Government silencing... raging pandemic gaining momentum inch closer fall winter potentially 100X see covid, flu, covidflu... could go wrong? remember gran kind thing embarrassing hell family back 30 years+ ago.

It always there, everyone camera record aware common is, might common people seem less shame always there. Ding-ding-ding!

This fragments data, disrupts it, abused pain lesser picture.

The goal lies, deception, corruption. cant believe stupid admin is. amount money lost versus much could've saved nationwide lockdown, monthly payments, rampant testing tracing able one best summers ever. Thats gone now. Winter coming. afraid. general strike means jobs refuse work conditions improve. thing talks money. everyone strike, corporations don‚Äôt make money. owns politicians? Corporations. There‚Äôs power numbers. majority people country middle lower classes hold modestly paying jobs essential corporations making money. yep. 

But people shit getting $3,300/year (not typo, three thousand three-hundred) paying paycheck, giant, profitable corporations get gifted trillions. staggered plans days person days online - holding classes outside etc. Things countries doing. 1.5 million new cases last 30 days US. Almost 1 million new cases Brazil last 30 days too. two countries common happened last 30 days? rarely go walmart would sure hell nicer company. tweet picture playing fiddle, drawing comparison Nero.

i cannot:( wide range, deaths skewed towards upper side age ranges death rate exponential relationship age. 65 plus isn‚Äôt really useful age range median age death Covid-19 80.

Here recently update one precise age brackets: compare actuary tables corresponding age ranges, see odds dying Covid-19 lower odds dying cause within year think party calling Covid liberal lie. projecting. majority conspiracy theory turkeys definitely Republican, mean everyone says Republican conspiracy theory turkey.

This current impasse humanity's fault. human condition admit wrong. Gonna edit. Definitely misleading! b

*were cases late May What's ""actress star?"" clear young people trying get infected Florida, plan mitigate let 30-90% population catch it. Young people prevent deaths best getting infected ASAP making sure pass anyone old. get back working sooner way too. downside, course, (and far elderly relatives) die lifetime disabilities. that's job charge prevent, instead simply ignoring it. okay back original question then... Ahh. pretty good handle want I've working part-time field time college. I'm pretty confident end want although COVID definitely changing things now. I'm mathematics major/stats minor jobs I'm qualified done remotely quite easily. could finished college without going debt would spent 4 years community college *save* money. unable continue working full time started uni, hence loans. lot leaders imprisoned worst.

honestly, why? know why. Stop coy. California 28th per capita COVID-19 deaths, yeah, we‚Äôre pretty damn good things considered. Definitely could better, bad considering current administration everything good day is. makes 19 hour, also type 1 diabetic child even decent insurance pump supplies CGM stuff takes big chunk money monthly. Never fear, Jared there. $800 UAE. fines everything COVID. Hospitals much done.

Tons could done, would way easier federal gift wasn‚Äôt useless. universal basic income place example effective lockdown would much easier do. everyone else says, ‚Äúthe full quote shows different context,‚Äù ignorant is. saying, ‚Äúthe science shouldn‚Äôt stand way kids going back school, SCIENCE SIDE,‚Äù science is, without shadow doubt side, saying, ‚Äúthe science shouldn‚Äôt stand way.‚Äù psycho. Sports over. Shut pie hole quit bragging yourself. Nobody cares.  Put mask keep mouth shut. No, yet evidence cells alone protect reinfection. wouldn‚Äôt unusual couldn‚Äôt. Twitter I'm seeing folks Texas post data links. ask link respond. Saw one person post false data deaths down. manually typed like 20 weeks false data. asked link source either post graph screenshot link? obvious numbers cooked.

It retweeted 100s times. 

You want wear mask, fine (well fine, right idiot). fudge numbers people see way. pandemic handled well would've possibly record landslide AFK sure testimony denied, questions asked anyway, absence answer interpreted confirmed answer worst possible light administration. Worldometers think pulls directly counties. BNO different source, guess BNO took 10,256 [Texas reporting added 5501 total cases Bexar County, subtracted actual total reported yesterday. gets 15,066...so exact match.... hit right nose. I, 30yr old woman, feel like youth stolen me. way back graduating high school 2008 now. fuck gonna enjoy *living* instead merely *surviving*? can't remember time worrying money. think maybe I've taken less five vacations since adult too? actual fuck? I'm fighting best community minority, educating people, protesting, etc, godDAMN exhausting. want that. want care. want enjoy time godforsaken planet still physical/mental health. feel like I'll never get live way. literally worst fucking timeline 21st century. Ha. Good luck boycotting store demographic let crush local competition. unfortunately might, least lives continually get miserable... see way out, without drastic change, seem likely anytime soon. Private security and/or off-duty police. US, prepare possibility knucklehead armed. Walmart/Target 'bouncers' therefore need armed well. zdogg youtube says wearing mask may prevent 100% chance infection, amount viral load get may determine severity. therefore, mask up. lower chances high load.... embarrassment (and putting nicely). I've showed similar terms spreading them

If could show RCT studies showing masks highly effective would appreciate Covidoble  dashboard donation tab. Nope. HHS ordered CDC continue show old increasingly incomplete data since longer new data.  Wow, quote taken brutally context. Well done media, slimey bucket hagfish *applauds*.

Here‚Äôs actual quote;

‚ÄúThe science clear this. That, know, instance, look Journal American Medical Association‚Äôs pediatric study 46 hospitals North America said risk critical illness COVID far less children seasonal flu. science side here. encourage localities states simply FOLLOW SCIENCE. open schools.‚Äù

The media TRASH! love father death, he's stubborn SOB. man seat belts made mandatory, despite thrown car whilst driving drunk (I never said smartest) surviving complications, refused wear them. pulled three times wearing one, finally third one, threatened take away license permanently. worn every day since. 

Pretty sure riddled Alzheimer's home making tell do, would walking around without mask constantly too. personal freedom, would annoy him. People like reason need freaking law, people right thing till tell too. ""poor choice""?

I wen gold-mind industry. wife (same industry) went pushed parents traditional (100 years) high-paying industry. 

It ""safe"" choice. practical, high-paying industry. 

We got top-tier school. One last century, definition making money. graduated 2008. Firms started rescinding offers. None us got track big-firm, high-paying jobs. 

We went sure thing. went practical option, make money. stable industry. worked hard school get there. 

The bottom fell Great Recession. never fully recovered, definitely us starting careers (there many studies showing bad recession graduate means lowered income life.). 

We supposed - excelled school, went practical profession rather fanciful academic one, matter. choices practical, based century data situation time started it. junkies give wallyworld.

I would fine living well stocked bunker rest life long fat internet pipe. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è fair, cited science support position, really make sense immediately saying science stand way. reflect cherry-picking *some* science agrees position, ignoring points disagreement. example, kids might get critically ill often, means little parents, relatives, teachers may infect severe illness. context, still reflects position. don‚Äôt, people pretty much guarantees they‚Äôll infect others. There‚Äôs gotta something else show people awful they‚Äôre being. I‚Äôm actually pro mask pro quarantine people traveling active hotspots.

Reasonable request imo went far twitter **SHARE CLIP SAYING EXACTLY THIS** saying **DIDN'T SAY** they're claiming said. gaslighting unbelievable. defended saying ""I said science side!"" except science fucking side, narcissistic gas-lighter. cause probably anti vaxxers too. wondering badly deaths going surge two weeks since fourth July weekend cases spiking much see this? true? expecting kind statement. refreshing greatly appreciate it. wonderful weekend try get sick! thirty women come forward allegations Donald Trump. admitted sexual assault tape paid pron star.

Best alternative make people lose sense self-preservation, caring neighbors. much people would like that, fucking happen.

They're greedy, they're fucking retarded.

I'm greedy next man, hence GET RID COVID. update every Thursday believe. :-) recognize aggravating factors anti-maskers . . . exact thing people wearing lightweight, breathable, stretchy polyester masks.

Charter schools also tuition free 50% don‚Äôt require teachers experience, education, certification teaching. receive government funding funding impacted amount students enrolled online program. 
Public schools ones suffer matter can‚Äôt get state government count virtual hours towards attendance FTE fund us distance learning. Let put bluntly:

Also fact advocating incarcerating child diagnosed mental issues, major shift educational platform, we're releasing adult offenders due danger? Makes asshole.... You‚Äôre absolutely right! think read recently inflation actual minimum wage closer $20/hour. Wow

So smart. Actually Right, record helping us AIDS pandemic praised every single president except recent one counts nothing. Guess what, public health experts agree Fauci, countered ""better"" fit narrative? call state data fake news, different state federal medical departments attack middle America says ""both sides partisan."" end, America accept medical information partisan therefore discredited.

He's already isolated US WHO, accurate numbers America going forward spotty best. dogs also getting tested positive? Remember people scared martial law mandating home quarantine back thousand cases? four worst countries regards Covid USA, Brazil, India Mexico. four populist leaders deny science. ever could predicted this.  also ask source people mention magnetism?

Like look Oxford vaccine manufactured Astra-Zeneca, US contract hundreds millions doses produced years end. Right? dumb kid too, always cared family anything else. Even angry teen want necessarily spend time still cared deeply safety. Putting mortal danger night friends never acceptable risk. nice job, kid. hope meeting worth it. 

MAN gonna live trauma..... amazing went masks increase virus risk masks end pandemic weeks.

That really true. read awhile back possibility - may need every 3 months. Big pharma approves that. company crack code trillion-dollar company. $1000 Two words: LOW BAR. pesky white legged shrimp Ecuador. live Sweden. follow local stuff. Mask use minimal scandinavia. Neurological symptoms add/adhd, etc caused Celiac disease regularly misdiagnosed doctors run proper full panel tests suggesting pharmaceuticals. 80% Celiac undiagnosed, 300+ symptoms, many Neurological. Yeah, wish Brazil Mexico much better testing could get closer reality. cousin way much power. I‚Äôm sorry. Masks really small part this. Behavior much much much important. still evidence well work community settings. suspect over-confidence mask efficacy, partly pushed misappropriated info effective attempt get mask wearing higher, leading misguided risk assessments, hence countries adopt masks, like Denmark, adopted much lower rates, like Canada, much better.

It easy judge person doesn‚Äôt wear mask visible, non mask wearer may prevent spread mask wearer. used think politic fight disaster-time happen fiction. see live quite new experience though. movie hero fight villain building collapse. Kill villain time escape safely. reality buried cause washing time fight instead running away ( English bad, feel ... ) Rephrase. Joe Budden this? pumping numbers? specific study retracted authors use correct type T-cells That‚Äôs.... good statistics. Also Iowa, going back work university 12th August. looking forward I‚Äôm mostly concerned high-risk coworkers teachers. 

I astounded lack action Gov Reynolds. Forbidding cities make mask mandate, refusing update policies based CDC‚Äôs recommendations. 

I saw tweet said ‚ÄòLiving Iowa like grounded God‚Äô honestly feels like grounded Satan. point view numbers big masks enough.

There situations masks use. Family spread example.
Patients hospitals wear mask. People calling ambulance emergency might wearing mask.
There workers might spend 8 hours day people simple non-ffp2 mask might enough long exposure.
There workers contact customers.
There businesses like bars restaurants.

My guess masks always help get situation control many daily infected need lockdown.

Would happy case masks would enough. wear mask people.

how many examples one need? WHO: going send full team China find came from?

China: Ah, that, he's couple, full, unmarked bags full cash, we'll leave outside door...

WHO: Update, taking us awhile get team together, but, travel China find came from.

China: Oh, forgot, there's unmarked bags full cash left back trunk, let get we'll leave back. Nah it‚Äôs ultimately trying strongarm one person (governors) obvious mandating masks. feel like scare tactic continue refuse listen yeah say withhold funds ""No country guess applies US? Tbh think point government actively trying kill many people possible save money give people medicare social security anything else like that. Nothing else explains sheer lack competence almost every single notable U.S politician showing since started. Well, mean time period, time span.

But yeah, think makes sense compare flu Vietnam War, point. Wow, thought lost faith people before, already checked friends Australia, Malaysia, south Korea, half joking Ty proof 100% young people survive end either permanent wheezing, need lung transplant, brain damage, number things? remember correctly, threatened highway/road funding budgets one. 3 weeks barely enough time new case numbers begin reflecting shutdown. would take 10-12 weeks strict lockdown bring numbers test, trace, isolate way outbreaks. contact tracing work country, refusal cooperate contact tracers lying would probably made felony. It‚Äôs confusing taken orders whole career I‚Äôd gamble lot morally grey say least. inability follow order bizarre, literally would‚Äôve zero negative effect him. See, can‚Äôt even read. Sad! can‚Äôt even leave state hate üòÇ Must suck poor! Good, Tennessee southern states please follow :) petty cruel. Wow, said try defend anything? 

I think things one sided

Also, since people try divide countries sub it‚Äôs good show still feel love neighbors found comment surprising, quick google. Found news report, seems cite several experts/studies suggesting quotes:

‚ÄúRecent studies show recovered patients tested negative coronavirus antibodies develop cells response COVID-19 infection. studies small yet reviewed outside experts, scientists say people experience mild illness, symptoms all, new coronavirus, may eliminating infection cell response.‚Äù


‚ÄúThere mounting evidence people exposed virus transient (short-lived) antibody response, cell response spite minor absent antibody response,‚Äù Dr Alessandro Sette, professor member La Jolla Institute‚Äôs Infectious Disease Vaccine Center California, told Reuters.‚Äù

‚ÄúT cells often important controlling viral infections. seeing evidence that,‚Äù John Wherry, director University Pennsylvania‚Äôs Institute Immunology, told Reuters.‚Äù

‚ÄúA Swedish study 200 people found strong cell response individuals mild illness symptoms following coronavirus infection, regardless whether showed antibody response. finding suggests coronavirus infection rates may higher studied using antibody tests alone, researchers said.‚Äù correlation non mask wearers islamaphobia? know stating constitution rights seems like discrimination involved well. Every gym gotten city higher intensity group fitness classes. Fans also big concern spread around aerosol particles. It‚Äôs party die want to. Die want to. Still waiting source information - yet cannot see individuals, wild. literally tried \*juvenile\* court \*juvenile\* detention thanks input. MAH FREEDUMBS?!? Yikes, guys cold first phase trials finished vaccine, they're moving second phase expected finish August. Another vaccine begin clinical trails soon.

However, options better, can't know ones hundred vaccine candidates currently developed tried work. So, even developing makes sense also license production promising drugs countries. anything feel optimistic moment? hard see. understand there's good news potential vaccine development even seems like 'best case still early 2021'. *want* doom gloom doing? Everything seems like we're careening toward even staggering disaster. ‚Äò[Spock]: ‚ÄúInteresting. Earth people glorify organized violence 40 centuries, imprison employ privately.‚Äù second this, another American  believe WILDLY unrealistic ideas effective masks are. big problem post glossed lot story like said ""The man made billions "" 

How make billions? Sure, worst billionaire history make mistake he's good guy. He's got enough sense realize left create legacy. literally like 3 ‚ÄúGood news‚Äù posts YESTERDAY vaccines... fact every single day every single thing changes people given ‚Äújust gone back normal‚Äù  OoOo. block letters front: **This Mask Cost $100** all. sat side table life. many times gonna repost article guy. RIP man sheesh let rest piece. I‚Äôve seeing article week straight Definitely! keep study mind try make decision whether go back yoga studio not. certainly extremely indoors - especially poorly ventilated area. Thanks help! many states, found way around virus imposing curfew bars. 11 pm? danger. can't get coronavirus. 11 pm? DANGER! I'm glad government smart enough discover true limitations virus. seems unaware relief ends several days. one worst Congresses ever. everywherep  looking like Koala bear tbh. thinking know would got dad sick died COVID. would really fucked mentally guilt one got sick

I see though lives thousand smiles away.. Shoot virus. It‚Äôs Texas. 31 58 counties currently monitored. 80% students. additional $5.3 Billion funds provided equity (making sure students available device, internet connectivity). Counties resume person learning getting monitored list 14 days straight lowering spread rates. Requirements providing robust curriculum distance learning part mandates (one largest complaints distance learning uneven children, probably largely due schools small window time develop systems).

I cannot speak districts obviously, know district started working distance curriculum since March now, running 2 pilots right make distance learning even better students. busiest department ever staff support summer since worked (since working creating distance curriculum). Normally normal summer projects renewing labs, upgrading refreshing systems, new construction needs.

They made mandates yet UC system (apparently new UC president starting). guidelines state region allowed outside gatherings. preaching camera meeting zoom quite thing actually around person. Yes multiple tests each. deliberately using tests vs. people tested lowers positive %. national state numbers daily one per person people make assumption rates apples apples. sure intent make numbers look artificially lower way makes numbers artificially lower are. believe they‚Äôre talking 2 vaccines UK, Oxford Imperial College ones Chances covid19 actually killed them. know kill multiple ways right? Pretty much, yep. One choose Sweden's neighbors undoubtedly find comparison makes look next Zombieland, well.

That's kinda feel one get good assessment simply making comparisons - far easy manipulate due choice comparison. Animal Crossing* Raise hand think US complete shit show Covid struck?

...

Contagion (2011) great bringing forth issue would happen virulent infection struck US/World US gong show there. 

You remember state effect, country, viewed way.  People probably numbed seeing almost 1k deaths per day New York back April. certain point, 'only 100' seem like big deal, treating numbers people.  Hey, 

Regarding kid IEP: law, district must provide services birth age 21. Check [Child teacher parent kid IEP. She‚Äôs five. might able provide services school, help. 

This one trickier things opening schools. provide services law, it‚Äôs really hard coordinate everything. (I‚Äôm opening it‚Äôs in-person five days week. There‚Äôs lot alternatives feel haven‚Äôt explored.) Read quote put context. used think whole ""fake news"" thing idiotic meme. no, media really bunch lying, click-bait generating science stand way this,‚Äù McEnany continued. ‚ÄúAnd Dr. Scott Atlas said ‚Äî thought good quote ‚Äî ‚ÄòOf course it.

Found cheering ny drops. Kept waiting Florida Arizona. climbed fast. Good job making this. mention great leader sending federal agents cities protests ongoing without personal governors mayors. Read thread. It‚Äôs alternate opinion conventional wisdom deserves discussion. 

That thread based Michael Levitt's predictions consistently wrong. He's backpedaling point. Two things article worth mentioning:

1. ‚ÄúThey infected older son, Zymet's stepson, became ill learned friend hung infected virus, mother said.‚Äù

Who dumb fucks tell someone coronavirus hang them? Shouldn‚Äôt considered form assault? It‚Äôs punishable withhold HIV status sexual partner, can‚Äôt punish Typhoid Mary‚Äôs?

2. ‚ÄúHer husband risk becoming seriously ill coronavirus diabetes, said. Doctors also said obese, additional risk factor.‚Äù

I feel bad guy hope recovers, sentence weird. wife needs doctor tell he‚Äôs obese? 

CDC needs get business telling people go exercise. long they‚Äôre sitting home lock down, get drop pounds. Cool healthy food yourself. virus likes heavy people! Yep. Unfortunately I‚Äôm surrounded right now. don‚Äôt even want know pissed he‚Äôs gonna get close gym again. US less deaths per capita EU, EU lot tests peak much testing explains ""great' numbers. Lucky kids! sounds lot fun enriching regular school day even normal times. many sides mouth person have? masks, made clear,but corona-mercialism 10,000 tests include staff like coaches trainers know right? side effect social distancing masks solves problems bad breath. expect UK countries use lot Imperial College one instead time progresses. aim ‚Äòreach billions people around world‚Äô use booster shots. Oxford‚Äôs use booster shots, Moderna US would transition Moderna‚Äôs bunch people going Valhalla /serious True, I'll give ;)

Surgical masks designed filter influenza thus significant effect transmission virus. So, force everyone wear it? full face mask proper seal effective. 

Forced frequent hand washing far effective reducing transmission virus mask. mandate law everyone wash hands every x minutes upon certain events?  pass senate either way ""t cells win yay"" comments proof anything nomatter patronise 

Instead, take retracted study proof? media mastered art ‚Äúmay‚Äù ‚Äúsome fear‚Äù write scary headlines technically true mostly drive unreasonable fear Sounds like it‚Äôs per location. one Twin Cities super strict $100? Whatever do? all. like saying man fell taken hospital said died gun shot wound. sounds equally strange. startling way see play out. guess whole state board pressuring idiot governors adopt policy resign. funding thrown states keep making problem worse anything rectify reason funding needed first place? This. matter steps taken prevent spread misinformation, nutjobs find way spin it. wasn‚Äôt detrimental public health, would impressed. article misleading. total 882 players opening day rosters last year. 

Eighty tested positive far. Good. Karens part. 
Sounds harsh people don‚Äôt connect virus actual deaths. LOT people dying! Wear stupid mask, nobody likes it. Don‚Äôt forget Georgia Arizona! Nope. Can‚Äôt provide enough information you. Every single health agency every single country recommends wearing mask prevent incidence infection also severity infection. hundreds scientific studies saying thing. much evidence it‚Äôs overwhelming. people like you. point really need rip people office, actively letting American citizens die, already massive corporations get drones back. yes, horrible shutdowns decimate small business. shit, times tough. suffering, soon be.

Why Fauci say March necessary?

And give crap 'saving PPE' bandanas, scarves old t-shirts good enough. able admit wrong make moves become better hallmark maturity. guess conservatives read bible all. election Nov.3 yank, damning indictment far fallen. - page list well map counties monitored list PetCo (at least ones Minnesota) Stop reading news. read data. good thus far. going vaccine, many people already year's end, regardless like case. even seem realize EUAs used vaccinate literally millions people prior official regulatory approval. anyone expect anything different Texas? hear they're considering prima nocta trying times. imagine safer could happen wear mask probably raging alcoholic beat wife kids.

(Found guidelines Yes uncounted cases magnitude higher uncounted deaths, even count excess deaths COVID. [CDC's best IFR 0.26% 0.65% (well ""bottom number BC).

I live condo building hundreds residents we've confirmed cases. can't ever feel sure it. risk high, even elevator ride. Beyond that, grocery visit area.  True keeping mind PPE shortages. best defense currently social distancing, next would facial coverings since primary spread virus droplets (and HIGHLY LIKELY aerosols). Therefore, hand washing much attack vectors. wish simple hand washing, unfortunately even public bathroom, shit plumes evade hand washing escape nostrils. Indian testing capacity right 300,000 = 0.3 million per day. Indian population 1.3 billion = 1300 million. 

So tests = 0.3 per 1300 nearly equal 1 per 4k, 25 per 100k, 1 per 100k..

Bye, thanks chat stranger. think stores need type security enforce this. I‚Äôm small upstate NY town, Home Depot place regularly see people wearing masks. would be...one issue literal orders magnitude difference number pro athletes teachers country.

Even support staff many people need tested major sports? 10,000? 20,000? 

How many millions teachers school workers need tested? 

I wish could test school staff daily basis...but tough. good point. I'm teacher realizing chance safely see family, live different state, visit summer (after two week self-quarantine, course). probably able see next summer. Kids disgusting. ever truely believe wernt getting spreading covid?! maybe berlin wall communism fell? granted like 5 years old. without kids MIGHT live. creating problems necessarily even exist levels we're discussing.

Whistleblowing does, fact, work. Antibodies (IgG) help NK cell response (bind CD16)! means antibodies sole mechanism immunity. right cell mediated immunity might important humoral immunity. course, antibodies important cellular response vice versa. unhinged Sadly, way ""kid"" learn Daddy dies. seems accurate, darth_tonic. 

The cells kill virus. opposite way. Mother virus touch go right now. Please know real. choice wash hands use toilet good hygiene. Wear mask! must love Trump then.

No that's dude - forget shilling for? matter explanation, credibility public leader ruined

No not. actually heightened. long keep watching CNN adverts, they'll love you

See even hate CNN like good little job. lost cuz lockdown

Sucks man - maybe gone college. exact struggle US having. data inconsistent delayed. Republican Florida voters didn‚Äôt seem issues voting Rick Scott multiple times despite small documented issues past. still get charged adult crimes juvenile court, separate section devoted specifically underage individuals things like make sure go back school behave. Grown-up courts time resources deal type thing.

I'm real sure understand works. keeps coming up. true uncounted cases would reduce IFR CFR. However, also true uncounted deaths would increase IFR CFR. tricky part calculating exactly numbers are.

And without muh freedoms can't watch NASCAR; likely, funding tied directly citizens businesses together. Louisiana last state change drink-age 21, otherwise receive Federal Funding construction (specifically relationship road-development) didn't.

It much money lose comparison lower drinking age. using evidence-based, ‚Äúshow money!‚Äù approach grounds continue doubling position despite fact evidence initially used support position disproven.

Do see contradiction there? don‚Äôt call someone prove negative unless already sufficient reason believe notion disproven may true. 

For example: shouldn‚Äôt prove coronavirus DOESN‚ÄôT predominantly kill people don‚Äôt floss. want believe that, burden proof you. never 100% stop virus infecting everyone possibly can. ~~SARS~~ Swine Flu infected 60 million USA alone, killed estimated 12k.

Covid-19 deaths consistently falling since week April 18. Check chart CDC (Provisional Death Counts COVID-19 1/4 way page): approximate 2 week lag death reports, look trend vs case count chart. personally think virus killed people possibly could (mostly elderly medical conditions).

I research total USA death counts month compared 2020 vs 2019 February May 2020 59k less 2019. I'm sure lockdowns reduced counts things like fewer car accidents, etc. think future bump deaths due people missing critical preventative care visits doctors diseases became harder stop due advanced stage. But, that's opinion. No. What‚Äôs callous attitude towards protecting others wearing mask. many people man infect? many infected someone else? many people hospital dead well choices. get give. Axis Covid Doubletalk, cater sides. Yes two sides wearing mask Oh feel that, sometimes thoughts head loud/ moving fast blasting music helps lol music choice pop tho :) usually end singing work lol
Lambda calc! That‚Äôs crazy stuff! always hit conservative relatives ""We courage convictions!"" without saying convictions come from.

Personally prefer people courage convictions.  gave mild seizure news another data point, that‚Äôs using justify assertion would results fall. data clinical trial information posted referenced saying won‚Äôt see results next year. data support claims vaccine available fall? sounds like answer ‚Äúunfounded hope‚Äù think agree doesn‚Äôt count data. 

Believe actually degree chemistry analyze drug trials professionally, I‚Äôm well aware EUA works I‚Äôm also aware challenges producing distributing medicine scale. rewatching Hunger Games recently thought would great could round narcissistic, selfish idiots world stick island away everyone else. way responsible people pay price mistakes. spam continues need ‚Äúsecond amendment people‚Äù Trump calls go virus. That‚Äôs works right? Sure, get it... many children actually live people? 2, maybe 3%? think risk willing take. Trump used Democrat Putin centrism far Russian politics concerned. Enough think he's way long done lot wrong, disagree exactly done wrong, Soviet revanchists, religious conservatives, ethnic nationalists Westernist liberals (groups necessarily mutually exclusive) cancelling afraid status quo.

As example, main C0mmunist party generally gathers largest percentage non-government vote overall, deprived regions, nationalist, anti-immigrant ""L1beral Democrat1c"" party prominent governors there. co-opted federally, though: time, prominent ""true"" opposition, Nava1ny, beloved foreign media Western-friendly rhetoric, basically Aung Sang Suu Kyi wearing pants, ethnic minorities justifiably despise him. 

I could keep going, think point clear. Chances are, post-Putin ruler genuinely popular support appeal West even less Putin vice versa; leader West may like propped corrupt elite represent pro-Western interests despised people way Yeltsin was. blame em Fried

""the risk critical illness COVID far less children seasonal flu.‚Äù

Aka cherry picked misinterpreted information.

Yes. risk *critical illness* *for children* less..

- mean spreaders.

- Also mean family members critical illness cause. 
- Also nowhere quote reference science suggesting open schools mislead.  Oh, right, he's 21 mock totally clear conscience dad dies ICU.

RISE stage 1 finished. Stage finished next month, go limited production, first adopters acting phase 3. 

Even optimistic plans, capacity make 70 million doses vaccine coming months - i.e. half population. Covid taking notes speak... numbers claim seem dubious.

Not chances aren‚Äôt getting higher think it‚Äôs likely would true like 6-9 months. yes. too. (also sorry asshole voting you, real human discussion wildly stupid bother downvote that, benefited personally hearing out) one aware COVID causing lung neurological abnormalities children well??

The public needs made aware fucking ramifications virus!?

Fed up. care.

If loved one gets ill, could see s.o. child die arms they'd numb- THEM, ""the other"", matter.

Okay, government said 'the sky blue' would argue they're wrong simply 'the government said it'? 


You're committing logical fallacy that's basically opposite appeal authority. Simply authority says something, make false. make true necessarily either, also necessarily false. rogue state strikes again. hate stands much anyone else, context clearly misspoke.

She's trying say science supports reopening, therefore stand way, ignore science.

We disagree science supports, saying ""fuck science, let's kill kids"". people though.  H1N1 gave permanent muscle twitches body various vague neurological symptoms I've carried past ten half years. joke, folks. nothing prove, matter say post? feel need respond doesn‚Äôt matter?

NEW YORK - recent autopsy study coronavirus patients revealed blood clotting present lungs ‚Äî organs throughout body.

In study published June 25 Lancet's eClinicalMedicine, autopsies seven COVID-19 patients revealed clotting small blood vessels ‚Äúmultiple organs.‚Äù

Dr. Amy Rapkiewicz, chair department pathology NYU Langone Medical Center, said COVID-19 patients known develop blood clotting issues. Doctors previously reported blood clots larger blood vessels people virus, also ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt quite clear directly related COVID,‚Äù Rapkiewicz said.

In Rapkiewicz‚Äôs study, published June 25 Lancet's eClinicalMedicine, autopsies COVID-19 patients revealed clotting small blood vessels ‚Äúmultiple organs.‚Äù

Rapkiewicz said observed blood clotting large veins coronavirus patients died quickly arriving hospital, also clotting ‚Äúin small veins, microscopic veins, would see microscope.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd doesn‚Äôt sound like big distinction, physiologically, takes different things happen clot large veins small veins. seems clotting system body really thrown whack certain populations COVID patients develop severe, fatal infections,‚Äù said.

The autopsy study also revealed higher usual number large bone-marrow cells called megakaryocytes multiple organs, including lungs heart. Rapkiewicz said cells ‚Äúusually don‚Äôt circulate blood, really shouldn‚Äôt find heart.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe finding larger numbers heart, abnormal,‚Äù added. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know reason why, connection clotting megakaryocytes produce platelets, platelets one things responsible clotting.‚Äù

Rapkiewicz said research needed determine connection relates novel coronavirus, ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt seem circumstantial.‚Äù

Some patients autopsy study received blood thinners, anticoagulant medications like heparin. findings suggest clinicians may need consider additional treatments anti-platelet therapies COVID patients target smaller blood vessels.

‚ÄúI think still need drugs patients autopsied received anticoagulation really less clotting big vessels, still clotting small vessels. need target small vessels,‚Äù said.

Scientists around world racing better understand SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, impacts body. Worrying reports indicated virus may capable inflicting long-lasting damage many areas, including lungs, nervous system kidneys.

A recent study led researchers University College London described 40 patients COVID-19 experienced multitude different brain effects, including severe neurological complications delirium, brain inflammation, stroke nerve damage.

In another study published June, half COVID-19 patients involved found form cardiovascular damage.

‚ÄúI think still needs basic science studies biology COVID,‚Äù Rapkiewicz said, added aim study others like researchers better understand prevent severe complications reported patients.

‚ÄúI lot phone calls people Johns Hopkins people (Massachusetts) General could underlying thing that's causing clotting, that‚Äôs really important sense it‚Äôs going prevent COVID. We're trying prevent complications cause people die.‚Äù

Here lancet study go work get sick die, economy matter much anyway. gotta use facial recognition catch them. wearing mask, can't catch you. bonkers. Kids school. aren‚Äôt going school going daycare programs like girls boys club. what‚Äôs difference?

Have kids school teachers teach remotely zoom. younger teachers aide classroom. Trader Joes? least one city does. even whether could've prevented it, risky things individual would still compassion die. really sets apart put others risk idiocy, little compassion. like race car driver dying sanctioned race vs moron street racing busy area...this guy knowingly went put people danger, wonder many people gave (and they're now) realizing it. Dark ages truly dark. Mother effer trying figure out/remember called AGES..

Have updoot would need signed president fuckwad, would need veto proof majority.

That applies legislation they're going pass. current regime would veto mask mandate pass senate first place, would certainly legislation takes money away party's states.

This ""proposal"" political warning, IMO. Saying word ""relief"", ""funding"", etc far certain get people's attention. public places outdoors like parks sidewalks possible social distancing? wear masks indoors public areas, fair, doesn‚Äôt explicitly mention whether would allowed (or least couldn‚Äôt decipher legal language did). Everyone limited amount compassion afford different people get burnt out. Withholding compassion man refused follow simple guidelines actively rallied perfectly reasonable.

Maybe compassion family, Darwin Award winners deserve themselves. Well it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre simple minded. see friend send video claiming 5G x think it‚Äôs research warning warn everyone about. yeah thank goodness nobody ever anything bad happen them. we're lucky that, kid, stay level financial readiness times. nothing unforseen ever happens eats anyone's savings.


you fucking idiot. don‚Äôt know that. I‚Äôve definitely struggled smelling tasting I‚Äôve sick past. 62,000 test backlog, hmmm entire thread completely insane
There perfectly good reasons slow school openings without resorting level hyperbole 

Evidence multiple countries shown children much harder time spreading virus much fewer symptomatic presentations, yet 

People claiming kids going intentionally infect en mass suffer lifetime breathing problems?
How much extremism get system... already approaching peak infections, peak deaths follow two weeks later.

Things nowhere near peak. like 1% US population infected, hospitals already overflowing. worst yet come *actually* shut things down. argument ""COVID-19 doomsday"" people follows: cases currently increasing rapidly huge fraction US may get COVID vaccine available. doomsday people, aggregate, want people take virus seriously now, vaccine irrelevant. cousin 17 lives grandma, whose 87. cousin, since start, partying friends, coming home grandma. We‚Äôve begged either stop going out, move one friends, refuses listen yells us life can‚Äôt stop living it. point, we‚Äôre waiting bring back infect (and likely kill) grandma. There‚Äôs nothing stop her, grandma also refusing leave house. It‚Äôs fucked. Mask mandate BARELY couple weeks ago believe clarified later sentence ‚Äúscience side‚Äù kids aren‚Äôt dying go back school. 

But basically disregards impact literally everyone else. Maybe they‚Äôre plan kill old people, let kids figure Lord Flies style. It‚Äôs dead link. Husband means ""Breadmaker"" early title Lords.  Poo poo hits vertical air mover. isn‚Äôt fucking chicken pox. people getting idea? Fox? I‚Äôm absolute disbelief. sociopaths üò£ Yes! hate suggesting yes it‚Äôs needed studies suggesting herd immunity level could reached around 50%. However that's likely he's onto something cases still popping places mentioned. find really hard believe NY keeping curve flat social distancing

Social distancing best method virus. That's *only* thing happening UK. really mandated masks all.

They also reopened cases low. matter many people crammed bar none it. can't catch something there. elected guy worthy title idiot-in-chief... Declining economic activity mean declining standards living.

Since started also hunkered down, become self-reliant. taken free time develop skills acquire tools need take care myself. planted large garden got getter fishing. Got better cooking, learned fix car got tools, built home gym... etc..Now almost third food plate something harvested foraged myself. 

But despite economic activity far lower, standard living actually rose. 

But worry without time, money, space done. 

Also, heard NPR guys like norm. People spending higher percentage unemployment checks usually despite uncertainty, economy ‚Äúwell‚Äù despite unemployment mass business failures. people like monsters. Willing kill people around obvious data. Even kills 1/100 actively chose it. Good riddance. resign recently USPS. kept sending fill different facilities, people sick. high risk wife forcing go 3 different facilities 1 weeks, take chances anymore. ""lysol"" available facilities they've ordered it..... That's fucked up. shitty hear, probably havent even hit peak wave, mention slow decline Texas July? 

I‚Äôd take offer. lol WHAT? Thank you. couldn‚Äôt find this.

This one cell guess. I‚Äôve seen image like before. also go around every flu season getting flu shot, 

Every year, 2/3rds US adults mask, social distancing, 

This flu. flu almost never contagious symptoms. stay home sick, avoid sick, take recommended precautions. Sanitizer telling people flu kills many people Vietnam war? 

I said that, used similar scale comparisons time Covid. people close, know well enough I'm going touch personal trauma. sensitive.

But currently unmitigated public health crisis people denial. consequences tragic clear present danger overrides sensitivity issue, least me. fail mitigate epidemic outcome dire.  worked cheese factory rhymes Taputo couple years ago. supervisors tried telling us could longer take bathroom breaks. even hour shift coworker raised hand let line bathroom. ignored. shrugged peed herself. entire line shut hours tried finding someone clean up. Yeah - supervisors ended cleaning workers sat break room. 

Why companies allow stupid stuff happen? Haha saw day couldn‚Äôt help nervous laugh expected nothing less Way dredge 2 month old post \*slow Run course? 

Yes, run course. still dealing (social distancing, global shut down, etc...) literally every epidemic that's happened several hundred years history? run course, however may be. commonality disease disappears becomes something think day day basis - happens without major protective measures. bodies develop antibodies similar spanish flu? knows, test them. mean bugger herd immunity theory, continued uncertainty.

I'm saying US handled well, also can't directly compare NZ &amp; US. NZ 1.5% US's total population US wingdings go way actively protest measures self protection (masks, social distancing, ect...) thinking infringing perceive freedom. Moreover NZ still eradicated it, unfortunately due Covid's behavior think shy call level 4 alert level literally possible due global economic structure.

Regardless Covid handled, eventually pass run course. 

Here's base opinion on: 
\- IFR still presently converging around 0.5%-1.0%: 

\- Spanish flu popped \~1918 (and handled similarly) burnt around 1919/1920: 

\- Anti-body responses among recovered persons varied individual individual relatively small sample size, pretty hard draw inference this: 

\- Social distancing &amp; isolation eradicating virus, self-protection relieving medical system enough deal cases come in. Eradication pipe dream, sprint marathon. 

Moving on, let's say sake discussion end status Corona akin seasonal flu. big deal? Well whats seasonal flu pandemic/epidemic?

 

1) level immunity within population

2) Healthcare ready meet patient needs

3) Vaccine available

4) Antivirals available

5) scale hospitalizations &amp; societal impact

So seasonal flu, another thing get's wrapped stats 140,000 710,000 people get hospitalized flu symptoms every year US one pays attention to. sound bad me.

My conclusion: Doom gloom resolve anything. easy hindsight present day see mistakes, act individuals try find silver lining shit sandwich we've given. caved exact people stand outside Target Walmart asking people sign petition ‚ÄúRecall Newsom‚Äù lmfao ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è course, can't blame safely reopen there‚Äôs vaccine people it.

There‚Äôs way could add travel time houses unless you‚Äôre willing spend several hundred dollars privilege. dislike Trump think damning, genuinely puts reelection ongoing deaths innocent Americans. exploding infection rate south directly trying get country return normal could get back campaign rallies cheering sycophants.

Hey, might find helpful: mean that‚Äôs great - google isn‚Äôt really issue remember one leader TV day basically laying like implied preference towards letting people get sick. Basically laying like, 'It's going life savings stranger's life lines. would pick?'  wonder WH fucked, people say things please President. would explain lot. Kim Jung Un runs NK. good look country. Something working 15 old enough go juvenile prison. like age 17 364 days old whatever want get punished ""you're child lol"". Got it. three smaller countries overwhelmingly healthy population big sense personal social responsibility. also happen ""free"" healthcare.

The part argument we're ignoring time. successfully fighting virus without mandated mask use... right now...

If roll back time two months, could said thing Texas. masks, low case numbers, R0 1. Yet are. first left home, 3 roomates 2 bedroom, older apartment eventually got torn down. Later, rented old, shitty, one bedroom apartment working save money.  started business, one time, 5 people living one bedroom, shitty apartment, also stored work equipment inside. made enough money rent mini storage put equipment in. people worked got back feet, moved places, one one. Eventually, back me, living one bedroom shitty apartment, owning home. stayed school, kids afford, studied, worked hard, worked LONGER many friends. delayed gratification. friends drinking Saturday afternoon, working. Sunday? Working. could live comfortably now. 

Anyone did. I'm multi millionaire, reasonably comfortable. immigrant US thing. many convenience stores, tailor shops, small businesses see run first gen immigrants, many times came little? worked hard whatever shitty jobs could get, saved pooled money, started bought business, used business pay kids go college, buy cars things parents children.

The problem is, many Americans feel like owed something. one owes you, me, shit. entitled opportunity.  We're entitled opportunity learn, work hard, take risks, succeed. everyone succeed? NO. 

What's phrase? Life, liberty, PURSUIT happiness? country opportunity, equality outcome.

Vote - long shot. Maybe knew something Fauci know... /s anti-maskers wearing masks. people think it‚Äôs hoax. can‚Äôt tell anything.

Some think it‚Äôs end world. can‚Äôt tell anything either. 

I‚Äôd wear mask stay away large groups; especially crazy/super annoying know-it-alls. Inflated what? Raw death statistics? completely unassigned death. Covid related deaths. simply death statistics. started finding much higher average deaths occurring Feb now.. strange. could figure happening period time would cause increase raw death totals?

In tiny study --before pandemic-- population adults children tested 4 strains coronaviruses HKU1, 229E, NL63 28and OC43.  study provides evidence re-infections endemic coronavirus atypical time window shorter 1 year genetic basis innate immune response maybe greater determinant infection severity immune memory acquired previous infection. 

I'm trying, way, say anything definitive human immunity Covid. corona family seem behave like viruses tend learn about. true. estimated 20% New York contracted Covid-19. large majority infections also came NYC Long Island; Upstate largely left untouched. Go bar near university. People don‚Äôt give shit. There‚Äôs still lot young entitled people missing unlike anti-mask sentiments spread perpetuate harm misinformation, example, sentiments hoping someone gets sick, pleasant hear about, can't actually hurt people. can't make someone sick hoping get sick; wearing mask heartless things anti-science gang doing. Right now, much world, especially US, undergoing literal psychological trauma virus, think need give leeway thoughts feelings cannot harm anyone else, even thoughts feelings negative punitive. because, trauma recovery, vent thoughts let someone understands, going able heal. Yea California sucks, that‚Äôs everyone moving West Virginia, Alabama Mississippi./s going sound elitist lot poor people dont follow news, probably little clue what's really going give shit.

I'm starting think makes sense chicken pox parties again, kids going sent schools. least would diminish chance spreading it, minimal step take dont want family infected. That's wonderful employer plan foresight. adhd focus better comfort home without people around me, different strokes guess.

But technogy... mean.. Pretty much everybody smartphone days.

But yes, funding physical schools could diverted grant every student cheap laptop. Ireland reported liberally, e.g. every suspected case, suspected covid death, deaths outside hospitals etc. countries do. reason Belgium looks bad paper well never bad there.

Belgium report liberally, i.e. 'if know something else', Covid. That's numbers looks grim, not, really, correct.

Ireland that, though. countries EU point started including nursing homes deaths. We're still worse report last week stating number records covid deaths far greater excess mortality compared average we've likely overcounted quite bit

We're curve _now_, people still mostly avoiding dangerous activities driving. well back April/May, _in spite_ people nothing dangerous twiddling thumbs. know said uncivil. attacking going people. merely brought rural NE Colorado masks. cities Wow. heck.

Long Beach great precisely it‚Äôs like LA it‚Äôs like OC. It‚Äôs thing. Los Angles County though. sure. get downvotes. wear mask every possible situation even deemed useless. Even open air none around me.

But afraid masks enough. there's millions dead never end even virus longer threat. ramifications living society millions people allowed die muh freedom going lead decades civil unrest economic turmoil. she‚Äôs really saying morality decency shouldn‚Äôt prevent schools opening. like either. I'm pretty sure smelling breath reason wear masks. comes mouth bull shit. Nightmare fuel every kid homework. Parents pull article say ""I post bail, start learning times tables"" help fat too. Definitely free prior health conditions. I'm dead yet.

Well, can't take ER capacity. So, AC. Thank friend- hope you! Happy worked better end, example competent government! Idk see people say ‚Äúeat rich‚Äù I‚Äôm assuming we‚Äôre talking bezos rich. want one. link seller? White people, course orange country getting worse surplus Karen's. ‚ÄúCalifornia come, right back started from‚Äù mean wont people stay home so.... possibility virus transmitted drinking water? 

Currently, I'm watching cousin's 7 month old baby running errands, make bottle him. bottled water available refrigerator, one drinking course morning. rush get bottle milk prepared, wound using bottled water drinking from.

I think virus, worth mentioning I've consistent (yet mild) cough course two weeks. feel little warm, think I've fever. still, I'm getting pretty paranoid thinking might virus symptoms showing, passed baby. hope kid scarred life. Dad sure is. last two mouth pieces needed someone straight give fuck doesn‚Äôt single moral fiber being. yea she‚Äôll literally say anything matter evil moronic. No....

We must‚Äôve watched different video. That's ok. numbers suppressed anyway. Looks like bad idea No, paying full would one hospital bed. completely agree. kids, did, would going school right now. Unfortunately, 10s millions people get thier guidance WH. see good solution. .....this welcome development cannot put minimum wage employees enforce going get nasty. Maryland built lab specifically private labs swamped.

Hmmm... what's private enterprise efficient?  Times like brings leaders spineless. I'm still disbelief governor's decision. Canadian, thank rooting NYC! Good. dies? feel sorry her. lives, perhaps set better path. spread people actually listening  people saying dont feel sympathy, saying stupid people deserve die? making dumb decisions worthy death now? Eleventeen Good news antibodies well. immune responses well. 37 that's still think true, seems like gotta decide whether gotta risk health make money. guess thats decision lot people make, seems kinda screwed up. 3 months... huge victory. read twice see message.  lie lose credibility trust. 

Dude... can‚Äôt say stuff like STILL suppprt politicians support.... study mount Sinai NYC. They‚Äôre probably still following patients late March (or April) virus blew NYC. Since it‚Äôs mid July (4 months?) may wait spell get data. problem able get past paywall typing ‚Äúnewsom schools‚Äù Google clicking SacBee article came there. strange. couple weeks ago friend mine called OSHA employer showed next day took care situation. 

A staff member confirmed case covid-19. employer tried tell everyone ignore refused test let anyone go self-isolation. OSHA showed forced test covid-19 antibodies, close business cleaning, etc. mess Wife coworker tested positive covid. now?
 
About week ago (7/9), coworker's wife feeling good, fever, called doctor, doctor told get covid test. Coworker said felt bad Monday (7/13), felt great rest week. Well, today (7/17) said wife's test came back positive. 
Masks week. interacted couple times day, separate offices majority time. doctor told stay away job another week, everybody office distance, wear masks sanitize everything. 

So question is, now? Stay away everybody week two? go get groceries? elderly parents friends asthma. need avoid weeks? Greatest American genocide, gonna YUUUUUUGE, China virus Mexico gonna pay it. It‚Äôs called style magazine. Probably why. propagate bars restaurants; propagate groceries ubers; shut us way propagate homes; infect friends family; shall never surrender!

Edit: always loved churchill‚Äôs speech essentially paints picture brits losing pushed back further, landing grounds cities hills, yet somehow speech becomes inspiring inverse proportion defeatism. Rhetorical genius. read article? that's discussed detail. Norway, denmark, finland. *COUGH! COUGH! COUGH!* ü§ò Yes Gotcha, makes sense, thought math off.

So also go around every flu season getting flu shot, wearing mask, social distancing, telling people flu kills many people Vietnam war? not, plan going forward? source? telling government care COVID safety? met man raped woman? 

Have met woman raped man? 

If nothing prove, matter say post? feel need respond doesn‚Äôt matter? issue permanent damage needs first foremost. people need see even live, life 

No, he's saying right people usa care everyone gets infected. That's outcome 300 million people get virus. know symptoms present? start gradually get worse they‚Äôre better? generally strength whole time? different person? dumb? He‚Äôs director NIAID since 1984. He‚Äôs working protect worthless, sorry ass DECADES. He‚Äôs advised 6 PRESIDENTS saved millions lives helping create PEPFAR. stupidity showing; research. Source: read it. people done. level lockdown. Also slowdown lockdowns implemented often started around time *they mentioned*. people preparing lockdown, naturally less stuff.

But like said last comment, dudes ""revelation"" virus hits level infection tapers off. literally herd immunity. Wow it‚Äôs almost like America failed state Woah, world going shit! aware that, thank sharing. look it. hate can't rescue every single one trafficked people! There's many truly villainous people, enough heroes keep check. Unemployment, grants small business... literally anything besides encouraging people spread COVID would great. think would happier threw money big pile lit fire. guarantee nothing, enough. Oh lawdy there's enough popcorn planet! Hey, whatever think best kids. Easter 2222 [21 trillion trump numbers in, could probably hit 28 said top head. Forgot those. Seems like costco required long ago forgot. Menard (regional hardware mega store) started requiring early too. Good news especially Sweden. giving us free cloth mask monthly initial two. required worn. six foot markers floor everywhere. morning meetings/gatherings. Breaks staggered avoid clustering. Sanitizer stationed place along disinfectant wipes machines. job left business usual. Deliberately infecting kids diseases like mumps chicken pox make immune used standard practice vaccination option. familiar children's book Great Brain written 1960's, depicts measles party. concept Covid mixers kids out-of-line historical medical practice. Precisely. 31, want wake hospital 2 months admittance 1) go PT reacquaint finer motor skills 2) live rest life body ravaged weeks kept barely alive various machines, 3) shoulder crippling debt extended hospital stay got $1.5 million. Catholic Church got $1.5 **billion**. Let's punish 1/1000 much punished church. Look, arguing entire criminal justice system exist, arguing wrong person, need overhaul completely. comment section saying reality is, whether works best way. Stupid blonde????? ROFL!!!!!

Good joke. press secretary opened mouth. LOL!

I ashamed US think drastic pretty good word level increase, which, yeah, completely nuts, though realize gotten extreme. Figures don‚Äôt lie liars figure... you‚Äôve illustrated point perfectly right here. Socially young person expectation Pro-BLM feminist. That‚Äôs pretty much observed. business affected selectively viewing listening want hear support livelihood. It‚Äôs desperate get even though they‚Äôre wrong Imagine much effective could cohesion employer going see disinvestment foreign companies U.S. boon Mexico Canada.  

Any company wanting open factory U.S. would mind. Needing pay healthcare, monumentally stupid government, worth hassle. hope he's tried treason murder every single Georgian dies due total complete ignorance.

This man deserves dance end rope he's people. Yay natural selection back! OK Guv..... here's minutes thinking gets me:
1. Use part budget fund every child age-appropriate Montessori math materials plus 
 providing parents information used.

2. Make sure every child computer free internet access 

3. Incentivize development new teaching protocols teach reading using internet.

4. higher grades put textbooks internet provide practice tests students check learning levels.

5. Reddit anticipate dozens better suggestions.  newest rhetoric seems shifting ‚ÄúI know friend friend friend didn‚Äôt even get tested got positive result!‚Äù ask information kind confirmation, magically never appears! Funny works. Here's thing.. 

In southeast Kansas, actual mask mandate, saw least 6 7 people walking around Walmart without mask. gonna enforce stuff say ""well, required it...""?? Absolutely. would earned respect people. 

I watched lot press briefings Dr. Fauci (ah, good old days) beginning thought, wow Trump taking seriously Pence working closely experts. relief it‚Äôs going get handled, finally break WWIII madness. 

Next thing know starts rambling treatments top head, thinking loud going rocker. Complaining unfair media, complaining person that. presents pillow company guy starts talking, like virus. went straight hell. America, need retailers step enforce mask wearing nationwide ü§£ No. Yes are. Online. time back March ok. Tyrant Trump bite whole administration could chew yet despite studies, FDA still determined risk outweighs benefits may exist, providing approval HCQ treatment COVID-19 infections.

Why think is? FDA director another Deep State stooge letting people die intentionally stick Trump? Or, perhaps, think might information ignorant would change opinion?

Of course, I'm sure PhD biochemistry enough make opinion actually informed.

You PhD biochemistry, spent hundreds hours studying stuff.

So antivaxxers study impact vaccines hundreds, thousands hours. make opinions worth paying attention lol. Im actually fucking shocked news 4 months ago today? dumb. Yeah Mom aggressive lung cancer half lung removed, COPD Emphysema, heart disease, severe scoliosis blocked kidney moved organs, well skin cancer removed lung surgery, cancerous thyroid come back 3 surgeries, 80% blocked femoral artery. wish making up, reality right now. 

Anyway, worn mask every appointment, sometimes hours, also lung surgery nurses respiratory therapists occupational therapists coming change bandages assessments.

I find hard believe someone tells can't breathe wearing mask 7-eleven buy cigarettes.

At end day people need try best right thing, pretty hard see others making excuses wear scrap fabric. 

There many options available can't wear mask, accommodations made, struggle. people ones causing problem. politician championing ""business usual"" gets virus mild moderate symptoms literally bragging virus really bad, guarantee used ammo defend position. ""See? got it, I'm fine, overblown"". would take put ventilator spending week near death say anything different. Florida live state now. fucking weird seeing people insta facebook still like... Pretending happening live GA elections me, mother (both us political moderate), dad (at time republican) filled voter registration time, three weeks elections. dad got approved time voting. Anti-maskers going ""do fly, hire, banned premises"" list would kind, honest, given amount blood hands. Lmao would probably burst laughing happened. People ridiculous tldr: Prez wants payroll tax cut one understand wants tax cut people employed vs extending unemployment benefits. agree OP, know anything woman, various evil people die feel need respect life even afterwards. Hitler, Osama bin Laden, etc. easy low hanging examples, though principle still applies people deeply grey moral stature. CDC also added language website saying data would updated past July 14.

Nothing changed existing data (removed site earlier) back up. Hospitals still required report HHS CDC. Let preface saying wife planning keeping 3 kids home virtual schooling. 

Having said large downside respect social/emotional development kids get interacting children. Additionally, many parents simply going incapable teaching adequately instruct kids. trust virtual teaching likely good classroom teaching. really bottom ignorance literally ludicrous thing ever heard entire life. world wearing thin cloth mask 15-20 minutes running store, restaurant, ect., equivalent starved death, shot, forced gas chamber. statement completely utterly moronic extreme. wear mask day without issues. Even N95s bad couple face shield. business controls law quickly becomes mafia. possible make model estimates rate people become infected, symptomatic, dead, operating school business. 

If possible say, ""in district 10,000 students 200 staff, expect X deaths hospitalized school year"" people might slow roll bit. think literally believe numbers fake. least that‚Äôs covid denying relatives seem peddling. local Home Depot signs went today. 2 tough guys without walking around store. Much better couple weeks ago. counties sheriffs police said enforce mask policies dragging us (Washington) bit. magic underwear protect them. updates weird living state already required mask buildings acting behalf people coronavirus? defending this... decision deadline made back March... kinda feel like forgot going happen thought Covid would non-factor now. Even beating heart human DNA linked severe COVID-19. 

(fixed you) math probably going prevent another record day. I‚Äôm similar boat rising senior too. I‚Äôm willing sacrifice senior expernaces even though it‚Äôs going suck. Good. ninny ass republican dumbass leaders won‚Äôt make people, preventing going useful establishment unless comply good fallback. feel bad underpaid employees enforce though. talking network news? reach younger audience. explained interview. really informative recommend giving watch. Yet CVS home infusion provide masks employees office, staff access accurate thermometers take temperature employees. No, referring delivery method vaccine. delivered body using modified (so can't reproduce) adenovirus laced spike protein coronavirus. adenovirus kind virus causes cold chimpanzees. 


You wrong vaccine modified MERS vaccine though. taking 2 different things Now, not. trying best let virus control us. moment.

I optimistic much money effort put finding vaccine, first success stories. know plays out.   neighbors don‚Äôt like practice social distancing outside wear masks work doors lol. 

Unless crowded location, still possible go walk far away anyone. Even late day early morning less people out. feel like getting outside getting exercise healthy, guess everyone different needs different things. Take care. means let‚Äôs spread virus far wide possible. dummies don‚Äôt understand due long term effects (not death) related virus likely collapse US insurance healthcare system. can't cover you? Like something big huge human rights violation right?  hell said need million?? extremely uninformed. Maybe instead whining, educate yourself. people Atlanta wear masks even Governor advises otherwise. Virus real killing people, killing loved ones. 

Fuck Governor Georgia put mask. small price pay helping save lives
. also first emperor Qin (China) went mad search immortality (mercury poisoning) one point literally tried fight tide (according legends) see get democrats elected Freedom recklessly kill fellow citizens? 

Fuck toddler ""freedom"". Peoples lives important comfortable face is. would ask good people Georgia voted Kemp Governor, can't blamed. There's alot young people still ignorant 

Remember fratboy dipshit months ago started? said something like ""if get corona get corona, I'm still gonna party""

Ya there's tons around I‚Äôm Florida see wide range people wearing masks. Old people, people 25, it‚Äôs mind numbing. Hahaha, made audibly chuckle *exhales loudly*

You guys ready? median age Florida test positive 40. feel like government ‚Äúcorona party‚Äù. Opening schools bars restaurants. Trying expose many people possible get done. It‚Äôs disgusting Coronavirus‚Äô favorite governor... funny started behaving Trump wore mask. Aside lizard tail, course. could ask police it. May lead disbanding Blue Lives Matter tho. can't wait childish Republican temper tantrums. But... flip side would none positive test results adults, would mean despite high rates kids, passing caregivers.

How would draw conclusion headlines? people read headlines move one. small minority read actual article. even smaller minority would think read. giving large number headlines desired effect. confirm: stomach uneasy. Fuck turmoil though. think that's might start here, feel fear people say keep symptoms long after. limit fever might sick people there. Anywho, trust admin haha nasa related family well CDC website updating hospital numbers Well, one way beat sense people. Cops.  dEAtHs dOwN... Better late never guess committed transparent American public information collecting coronavirus. Therefore, HHS directed CDC re-establish coronavirus dashboards withdrew public Wednesday

Lol. Fuck you! mean government agency funded tax dollars actually going tell bad coronavirus United States? Oh thank fucking much. nice you. great bunch lads... comment response statement thr choice die behind school huge gray area distance education puts children danger dying. specific situation nothing fact statement ridiculous Get ready bunch new content /r/PublicFreakout  American would hard move UK Canada?

Considering leaving Looking forward seeing Aflac Duck roasted alive. K silent. Yup. rather, they're training fall sports. 

I live St. Louis last week bike trail came across assume high school track team. group probably 20 standing huddle end run, breathing heavily expect. another 20-30 still coming finish run huddle up.

It puzzling seems like easiest sport earth train isolation. run alone like every runner trails day. Lol guess guy spin like top. Hey Zuck, go jail, helped cause shitty misinformation world wade thru Oh shut fuck ü•∞   72 players likely many come already. Alot lost careers. chronic fatigue loss lung capacity wont able continue play. may may best decision plenty downsides
-not kids computer/ access internet home
-what 3+ kids share one computer? 
-online learning, time, inferior in-person learning. kids learn well online, classes like band, arts, science labs, cooking classes, etc almost impossible. 
-parents likely still work means either parent quits job take care kids(which means less money coming in) pays daycare(which means virus exposure)


I personally think good option would schools provide extra learning material students whatever basically cancel whole year. least elementary students. one left behind kids class everyone skips year. childcare problems still exist gets rid issue trying help child learn may access useful tools like internet access feel moment, one shining example bureaucracy complex cheat through, may saved country. 

That reversal, obvious, hard fake, easy notice, saved us?

Folks, know going tits up. least know now, arent simply questioning sudden loss balance.

Oh, also, I'm hopeful may represent growing trend positive possibility. may make fall election okay. Daycare option us working. sucks. \s!

/s I'm lucky I've employed entire crisis even managed start much higher paying job previously. I've inconvenienced able enjoy normal leisure activities, doff PPE hospital. 

I'm sorry hundreds thousands / millions people let politicians wait relief. Nah, let‚Äôsee guys kill enough first. atm don‚Äôt need foreigners kill Americans. Coronavirus‚Äô favorite governor... Even it‚Äôs good reason, it‚Äôs insane corporations rule country politics.  Shithole countries, amirite?! Ask southern governors blame bars pointed example bunk, fact were, keep moving goalposts. Screaming ""sheeple"" throwing shoes worker asking put mask? risky? SARS CoV-2 positive share tests, last 7 days data:

  New Zealand  &lt;0.1%

So, US *just slightly* better testing developing nations. Encouraging self harm violation reddit's ToS depending live, crime. also kind shit thing do. You‚Äôre 4 hours slow, mate. Publix made mandatory. Effective next Tuesday. referring specifically paying people stay home part (CERB), yes!! time even felt reaction bit slow!! horrific. Wonder DeSantis Abbott follow suit next? much winning. Smh. probably spread anyone else, good you! 

Also, sorry, sucks. hope recover(ed) nicely one immediately family suffered. They‚Äôre learning CCP... guess larger chains afford balls right given much traffic see everyday regardless. catch working? son autism actually germaphobe. OCD regards hygiene properly washing hands much since elementary school. got trouble many time yelling even fighting kids wash hands going bathroom. 

So yeah, follow proper hand washing. know dang sure. thought too. Math? worry, man. Reddit hoard stupid people idea upvoting downvoting. see upvotes, upvote too. See downvotes, too. Unfortunately first voters turned downvoters. plateau testing hit capacity. They're overwhelmed.

This 14th - Arizona‚Äôs data muddled. Testing capacity maxed, affects case count, see similarity shape charts. looking metrics, today state reported record hospitalizations 2nd-highest number deaths.

The Covid Tracking Project I‚Äôm 17 I‚Äôve staying home day wearing mask every time go public. It‚Äôs crazy somehow common sense wear mask people older mature me.

Also it‚Äôs generations people wearing masks. It‚Äôs one single generation. mean charged 250 called contested it, insurance company confirmed coded incorrectly, got taken off. signed away rights. Good you. government, like every first world country did. Putting money economy helps everyone time like this. propose without humans well? Humans much better vectors mink confined farm. Culling infected humans take priority attempting limit spread virus. flag good news? might retarded. 9. recall study China housed sick people close quarters didnt much. AFAIK sick sick, immune system already battling it. Initial viral load really matters time set up, already detected immune system. idea high initial viral load = severe symptoms also definitively proven. already point? restrictions AZ place protect people? Trump eats beans America burns European I'm blinking article. Supermarket masks enforced ever since March still are! likely solely

 any...evidence? ~~god‚Äôs~~ Covid‚Äôs work... Deathsentence looks like hes weeeee stressed.. wait lawsuits start flying again. Incase alot unaware day florida shutdown went court sued shutting down. watches summer?

School never babysitting anyway. Treating babysitting detriment education, gathered looking US fairs global education rankings.

Honestly Federal State governments providing assistance. tax dollars for, benefit nation? like AIDS? /s yet. wait long register? Im true patriot here. rest bitching me. starts mask. Next forced vaccinations enter every building. forced chipping bodies. going lay one too? America gone, Im depressed see many fellow Americans already letting get pulled right beneath without fight. well that's good least. people cap around 8k  giving taking 2k either way. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* government regulation businesses gave us minimum wage, days off, removal child labor, health restrictions, fire restrictions, etc. can't believe people think running government like unregulated business anything good. question who‚Äôs going enforce this? people barely get paid living wage probably don‚Äôt care jobs begin with? needs done regardless going make happen  unfathomable many governors US, absolute fucking imbeciles... Let's hope moron gets voted out, like assholes Florida, Arizona, Texas. I'm sure enormous irony lost all

/s know pulled mask sneeze made sure elbow aimed away everyone. worried would phlegmy still needed wear mask rest work day.

Not sure totally right choice. Illinois mandated agree. wording awful. huge moral shift. Regular people got left behind seeing it. pointing south made contributions science country. You‚Äôre one saying south nothing proud of. Talk bad-faith Given case number crowd casinos think effective contact tracing done. Good. deserve it. Honestly?  People need governor mandate masks point. Frankly, compliant masks continue it, believe won‚Äôt would even mandated card carrying ‚ÄúMental health‚Äù problems wearing masks.  So, everyone information need make mask decision point. live areas apparently separate insurance could get would cover med flight needed it, FYI I‚Äôll sitting you!


.... what‚Äôs dinner? whole country. certainly New York, opened businesses today. Wrong. Shut down. r/peopleofwalmart also juicy tech research institutes.

Revered Invader, please dont pay attention Florida Georgia moment, governors HULU brain eating microbes eating brains. Perhaps try push Oxford vaccine released September know say early. CVS pharmacist here. got notice stores would requiring masks couple weeks ago. signs posted entrance. person/patient walks without mask, there's nothing terms making purchase one kick out. essentially cannot even enforce rule, according last contact received district leader. Good know, bother trying teach son anything let know hippydipster going send money every month already shut down, lowest infection rates country. even think talking about.  hem/onc doc told today telehealth appointment, he's never seen anything like it. said hospital consults 70% covid. San Antonio, Texas. rings bell. It‚Äôs almost like 2 weeks assumption would work Proud you. üòâ 

You know say, never argue idiot they'll bring level.

A lot venom there, what, really?! think assumption dont need negative test ""clear"" virus shedding doesnt occur indefinitely. Getting negative test 3 weeks doesnt change anything practical perspective. still feeling sick, may test negative anyway (this happened friend mine, happens often) thats one less test someone doesnt know whether they're infected yet.

Its ideal, none ideal. vote weekends only? sympathies. suffered long time ""I can't believe keeping grandchildren me"" mother. committed going church right grocery shopping mask etc, started letting see kids everyone masked. kids little older, would absolutely keeping everyone away baby! Target implement policy Aug 1. Let's fooled pushing policy hopes goverment action requires it. dont argue customers point government bad guy. like along. However, reason cant implement policy sooner. ....Then say whole country. making sense. sick back teeth trying lose weight. got great routine back losing loads, whoops, knee dislocates, can't walk week can't exercise three months. came back fatter started. try again, eating moderate portions, losing bit weight develop mental health problems regress back eating I'm sad, I'm fattest I've ever been, 263lbs. im super cycling, least half hour constant cycling every day, weight come off, even miss breakfast. I'm definitely toning feel even fatter started. gives fuck wins, need vaccine needed three months ago! last decade....way more... video awhile back NJers yelling lady store wasn‚Äôt wearing mask. yelling Jersey accents made even better. COVID got y‚Äôall hard early on. probably lost wall posts, someone knowledgeable explain something me, I‚Äôd much obliged. Please correct misunderstandings may below, everything doesn‚Äôt add me. 

My understandings;
-Hospitals supposed send data HHS.
-Hospitals supposed send data CDC.
-CDC operates division beneath larger umbrella HHS. 
-Today, without data posted, HHS directs CDC post today‚Äôs data. 
-CDC posts today‚Äôs data along disclaimer data inclusive (which supposed reason shifting HHS) since reflects reporting hospitals sent data CDC (as hospitals told do).
-Having COVID reports go HHS supposed streamline data, making easier access use government offices. 
-Transparency regarding data supposed paramount, public supposed anticipate access accurate information soon. 

My questions:
In interim unveiling ‚Äúnew‚Äù access point hospital-reported COVID data, (the public-at-large) getting incomplete information division longer supposed receiving information let alone releasing it?
Has HHS said anywhere would find data ready shared?
Has HHS even released supposed take place?
Are data get individual state reporting less accurate CDC getting/reporting?

TIA! So... that's Trump sanctioned Russia, that's Trump armed Ukrainian rebels eastern Ukraine, that's Trump demanded Germany pull put Gas deal Russia. That's Trump moved troops Russia's borders. Also bombed ally Syria stationed taking control oil fields.

Trust hate trump, stupid Russia narrative grinds gears. shit like gets Potus aggressive hawkish could start war. Seriously, people attacking trump hawkish point view? Baffles fucking brains.  wonder never got tighty whities $.35 . Strangely, television news tonight.

Yes, live Germany. College kid here. know it‚Äôs REALLY classes. supposed get laid online? /s know would happen? poor disadvantaged people would get cited rich people would get that‚Äôs way works practice. end? would better society handed masks. everything needs fine. current law, insurance can't coverage limits. long insurance owe maximum pocket year. much depends good insurance is. mean swig diabetic meds what‚Äôs brown back? speaking pandemic always best get close people speaking remove masks. Even ask 3 people pictured Exponential growth destroyer worlds. industry buys governor, BUYS governor!!! Oh oh know one! California.... Dumbass ok though rough week didn‚Äôt hospitalized anything like u saying? survived covid left oher illnessess result virus, die? kill themselves? let die icu? argument lol constitutional? power would law enforced? Yeah gonna say lol one wearing required law educate children states allowed homeschool. go jail send kid school. Weird criticize people making life choices depend practice often compulsory many cases almost universal cultural norm... 

There time send kids school... also hunted/gathered/grew food, made clothes and...you may get chance stuff things get bad enough...even 100% self-sufficient live grid still weird criticize people normal participants modern life... title terrible, mentioned. read like ""Ignorant anti-mask Governor sues cities requiring masks listening science""

Another absolute imbecile elected office governor. kind stupidity would expect see small town 50 people. governor state almost 11 million people. moron realize asymptomatic carriers COVID, could spread virus.... pandemic.

Things normal.

The longer pretend normal, worse get. Evidently check clear. Sorry Karen ya can't come ! said:

Virus Politics attempting deny ignore it

Politics accepts science answer fighting pandemic much better. Well, expect help state leadership. What's 
your mayor's strategy? I'm seeing 66k cases worldometer even 8pm est, near end day reporting big jump? use site often. understand coming from, hospitals safer schools. hospital safety protocols, don‚Äôt see 300 different patients day, patients wear masks, leadership looks you. 

Right now, teachers many states none things. There‚Äôs shortage tests testing facilities drastic increases infections. That‚Äôs they‚Äôre prioritizing. people getting results week testing. Hoping so. Looks like there‚Äôs new thread showing change got squashed due public blowback. dumb question... able get information CDC ... still rely data shown website ? Quite spike deaths July 25th US

I think 1500+ per day foreseeable future

Edit: meant July 15th you, friend. TX one southern states, feel terrible guys every day. getting crushed MA, least doubt local government safety prioritized, even question. would explode legally follow Ron DeSantis telling lots versions name depending time place. GOP become totally reliant lying way truth; say something true, want true, people begin think true, therefore becomes truth. 

That going right now, trying propagandize virus oblivion repeating lies numbers, mortality, etc. always worked past; worked well, fact, lost way keeping supporters. 

COVID awful strange way might positive come this: knows trump GOP would've done struck? virus one things cannot lie general populace outbreak started....which exactly seeing happen. 

People ardently masks, fervently believe COVID hoax, whatever, GOP telling directly via right-wing media, doubt continue believe see virus directly impact lives. 

This Hillary's emails, could lie much wanted supporter would ever able verify veracity statements, Obama's birth certificate, could produced still denied - cost nothing deny it, realistically matter either way. 

But lie cost something, almost one willing pay price loved one's life sake denying COVID. get hit reality, back quickly, like TV host simply deleted twitter account son diagnosed. hurts even betrayal, one tangible many, fatal. 

Why GOP take stance COVID? healthier population means healthier economy, can't it. Could simply forced follow trump's lead this, following someone else's? 

Mysteries abound... teachers r/teachers talking using full go back class. Maybe would work give little extra protection? Unfortunately means problem. stay inside another month Florida herd immunity soon  Citation needed. Ignorance bliss. Head sand mentality designed create engagement , specifically controversy though. argue turned like . separate two?! pandemic due politics ... way really fix get traitors White House senate never vote gop. anti mask, sacrifice children elders holy economy , pro virus , pro Putin party .. long ago stood noble things clearly good vast majority us. Medicare.gov stats various hospitals, believe. #LAYMENS TERMS: DUMB FUCK. EDUCATE THEM! Sure, kids better learning, sure, timeline short. know details, one damn year hindered education going destroy young ones. School perhaps dangerous vector transmission. Stop madness. People suddenly stop learning things hit certain age. Hell, i'm 30's i've learned quite lot past months - i've learned many, many people quite evil. 1% pay anything, also worked money don‚Äôt get people assume foot bill earned cash rest. hate Putin much anyone here, 1/2 cases/1M US less 1/5 deaths per 1M, would say US trying find Russia's secret dealing COVID is.

Canada, joke, every 11 people found positive 1 died. good Canada Canadians using people?

140K people died US within 4 months president calls ""flu"" fact lie. political responsibilities US scoring among worst entire developed industrialized world. DAILY new case load US getting much cases found China 7 months China's population 5 times bigger US. 

What pathetic low life political bullshit propaganda trying transfer blame mass murdering tens thousands people country trying steal big secret. vaccine? vaccinated? vaccine, vaccine, even vaccine would probably take years significant part population would vaccinated. vaccine ever long term effective strains virus labeled flu? 

If hope remedy effects virus, probably coming Russian labs likely handed open free patent anyone manufacture, private industrial secret sold profit. trust Putin, trust Russian scientists right thing done several times past. indoor???

What hell wrong us. Strictly speaking old Norse would Kn√∫tr old English would Cnut. many spellings name depending when, would used King Cnut/Kn√∫tr's day. NYC open. That's numbers low.

The guy promoted admiral Trump nominated position HHS Trump. Karen‚Äôs like lies Sally. Died unsafe nostrils.

Some causes worth dying others. think article saw well. concern was, get 50%, vaccine may get us masks either. R values higher number states, summer, outside flue season still ditching masks social distancing brought 2, 50% better placebo vaccine (sidenote, placebo vaccination thing?) bring new value 1. Obviously, we're hoping vaccine better that. think optimism button broken, sort thing noticed math presenting. means you‚Äôre less likely spread illness good reason angry. making libellious insinuations here. Scientific espionage ‚â† harming patients doctors, trying make sound like. Still, I'm one yelling capitals essentially specific reason. know, kinda late try reasonable person.

Maybe we'll get goddamn single payer healthcare Companies dont give fuck people, theyre balancing costs sick employees/closures employee outbreaks potentially fewer customers. Pharmacies didnt originally fear losing business Walmart dont need worry that. Dont worry hes Republican-ing. eventually locks Texas, say ""Its fault, told would happen didnt listen"" go full circle blaming Democrats spreading virus.  belief hot weather stops spread

The CEI praised [destruction Net say anything want, feel free link. many years?

Because literally timeline ending. Everyone expecting perfect vaccine faster ever type virus never able stop. unlikely yet everyone seems assume going happen overnight?

And yet dipshit country arguing masks locking ineffective spurts. four months figure done nothing productive. blame parents manage virus risk real risk going broke safety net?

I would bet world parent. stupid enough create account. Plus feedback loop implant satellites would gnarly. HHS attempts doctor, manipulate, hide data regarding COVID, obvious. Hospitals report data MANY, MANY sources. start seeing massive discrepancies reported CDC/HHS, compared individual states, organizations affiliated administration, actions extremely transparent.

Karenhood traveling corona formula calculate proportion population needs antibodies herd immunity follows:

1 - (1/R)

If R 2.5 need 60% population antibodies herd immunity.

If R 7, need 86% population antibodies herd immunity.

But R 1.15, need 13% population antibodies achieve herd immunity.

In UK, even though shops pubs open, we've suppressed R 1 people still working home plus social distancing, masks improved public hygiene. % antibodies places like London 20%.

So, herd immunity. goes New York City, goes Northern Italy, goes Sweden. Well, amount daily covid deaths hospitalizations gone since beginning April. like going much faster rate now. happen ""greatest country earth""?

For different reasons it‚Äôs also good compare viruses given virus, like said, comparing seasonal flu flaws flu seasonal therefore doesn‚Äôt impact pandemic.

I can‚Äôt understand whole wearing mask thing. I‚Äôm Australia zero community transmission (issues another part country moment though) don‚Äôt wear masks - life pretty much close normal people moment. imagine change if/when community transmission comes back hopefully lot people complying mask wearing it‚Äôs brought in.

DeSantis claims he's following science, made impossible health directors follow science. ensuring schools open unsafely. Fauci isn‚Äôt CDC director. He‚Äôs head National Institute Allergy Infectious Disease (NIAID) department NIH also HHS Ah, true staple retort American idiot. point say build Mexican wall one along 49th well. Hell, let's even pay it. Blink twice need help, CDC. Question, see kinds numbers time, ever feasibly pay back continue life screwed life?

Because 240k cost house Netherlands people struggle even pay mortgage entire lifetime. (40+ years working)

Now know salaries US triple Europe still, that's shocking amount money. (A ""good"" salary would start around 3000 EUR month, tax around 2100 remains) gets 36k/25k per year.  Birth control exists. particles mostly attached much larger droplets, masks helpful. Vaccine happen begin with. Itll fail final phase One reason people anything right still choice. They're completely bled dry yet. still money, food bank, hope... 

But... 

Any sentient organism, backed wall, instinctively go survival mode. Reptilian brain kicks boom. Lol, two college towns AL? need study figure That's want think. spend untold amounts money boosting social media accounts/pages ""dumb"" Americans, make seem common popular due unearned social clout.

People spend day internet realize this, get stuck alternate reality claims like ""40% Americans utter idiots"" spread. Again, want. fabricate demoralize. Stop falling it.

Plus 3 asymptomatic cases, still trying trace came . Leading questions asked maybe. Spoke friends seem worried. know AIDS like 30 years ago, right? entire point article commenting Sweden excess deaths every week year since week 12, week. 

Since COVID first entered country, deaths every.single.week.

There way possibly deny uptick deaths weeks COVID Sweden. 

Deaths COVID entered country. weeks relevant discussing COVID deaths. weeks disease country relevant. OBVIOUSLY. 

An unsourced graph twitter link support troll move. purposefully shared trolls. go back troll hole cancer society. No, read title article, misunderstood that. guy told article actually means, thank instead doubling stupidity. Let's honest, none us really know.

All say people ground China whose job ensure safe business travelers. latest news China basically 100% contained Beijing back normal. sent people public hospitals several different provinces make sure overwhelmed get Covid China, even American, required go public hospital private one. even showed us photos took know we'd getting caught Covid, looked like normal hospitals signs government cover-up. people sick China, they're certainly going hospitals, really make sense.

There's also strict set rules return China right now. need special visa (all visas China currently void). need make health declaration province flying to. land, get PCR test taken hotel government agent quarantine 14 days. hotel, temperature taken twice day. end quarantine, receive one test basically free travel domestically within China restrictions.

I say also several hundred employees Chinese nationals know single one gotten Covid. business purposes, health information considered confidential pretty good personal relationship lot people China none ever got Covid know anyone got Covid. even know one person Wuhan couple months lockdown know anyone got it.

Buddy, fatality rate high healthcare system overloaded. ten times system overloaded - tests tests. system overloads Florida ten times die daily currently, fucking matter they're tested not.

There's natural R0 social distancing requirements. seems much higher inside weather months. factor everything throw it, including acquired immunity get R0 1. single magic bullet requirements vary significantly depending outbreaks occur.

Probably point trying get Sweden's still long way herd immunity, R0 remains 1, social distancing times year lot people arguing.  anti-maskers (notoriously republican) complain wearing masks ‚Äúrestricts freedom‚Äù + ‚Äúwe dont want like China!@@@‚Äú blame sports leagues able pay access. blame federal government making sure response plan place scale testing cover everyone first place.

Hey, too! time I've gotten better handling them, spend longer time usual wearing one little back.

At point, noticed haze half-coherent panic fingertips blue. terribly unusual I'm cold, occurred much wasn't. dawned issue was. I'd holding breath breathe very, *very* shallowly.

So thought ""Ohhh. actually stupid breathe.""

That bit self-deprecating humor first step calming bit. sat focused taking steady, deliberate, deep breaths despite discomfort everything quickly pinked back up. I'm sure lack breathing anxiety/panic favors either, really.

I anxiety disorder, issue masks combination claustrophobia deep discomfort warm air face I've never entirely understood. can't stand car heater vent pointed face I've always loathed anything covering lower face. can't even put head least lower face covers bitingly cold (old, old house) feels like drowning.

Anybody things people going hole homes delusional. Yes, help people financially shut essential businesses, nobody isolating.

I went camping last weekend spot normally quiet empty; totally packed. got place camp knew area well enough know hidden spot was. watched literally dozens people hike trail little lake, I'm sure felt worse people going find overcrowded there, sensitive area around lake destroyed level visitation. He‚Äôs suing make wear masks? senior U.S. health official

I really doubt Trump lackey, wont know details.

The fact fuckload new cases states getting way behind testing. Since didnt shit order hit ideal testing capacity, makes sense prioritize new cases. It‚Äôs kinda wild watching happen never coming common denominator situation. Weird Universal flying radar. know they're lot smaller Disney World, still huge resort. 3 parks, bunch hotels.

Like servers going physically ignite within Reddit server area. Lmao mandate people back seat (if vehicle even one)? think proportion injury due hit another person even situation?

Again, poor analogy. idiot driving without seat belt (let's say themselves) presenting risk others. stupid selfish. wearing mask right stupid selfish. better analogy might people smoking inside crowded space non-smokers. simply drinking driving. city announced mask mandate weeks ago bunch people went next city counil meeting maskless claimed ""medical exemption"". went meeting could spread conspiracy theories virus, course.

Well according British Empire law 1770s guess makes sense. I'll paste wrote threads down, bid stupid, played rightist talking March, NY losing hundreds people term ""social distancing"" even floated around, let alone mask shitshow. Mistakes made, adjust fly, densely populated city country reporting 10 (or 0) covid deaths daily. excuse southern good ol' boys? They're posting new case totals higher NY's peak daily basis, that's juked stats, thousands dying. saw NY, NJ, MA, etc. got hit turned around, COMPLETELY IGNORED it. yeah, people died New York, fuck South's excuse ignoring it? think answer interchangeable couple others, think it. Everyone gets participation trophy though! would never thought CVS Target would followers Walmart leader...what weird world today confirm. CVS required everyone mask currently higher per capita death toll. 

Have followed Sweden death toll last 5 months? constantly increased higher neighbour, higher lockdown countries even higher harddest hit country (They death per capita France they're far Italy) become 5th country world.     
How could rest Scandinavia possibly catch 5-10 times inferior ratio daily deaths decreasing?!     
The way Sweden could stop 5th country world Brazil, India, Mexico overtook good news none countries.         
Seriously, proof need?     
You think proven ineffective 6 months (when *supposed be* effective) suddenly get inverted? make sense all. Sweden failed, rest world right, period. Yeah New York seeing much good police cuts now. Trying best murders catch covid rates. land border, people still fly ~~behave like twats~~ obey quarantine... Except using southern pride point. talking northern pride, fact even think that's thing degree southern pride is.

Stop moving goalposts, start discussing good faith. Right? Like come onnnnn you‚Äôre one wants go out. everyone would stay inside still wouldn‚Äôt happening. lot thinks it‚Äôs fake.

I've hospital several times less day, bill time $4000. can't imagine 79 days hospital might cost, article shed light financial aspect.

I hope figure pay medical bills. Even insurance, usually cover 100%.

If healthcare corporations collect pandemic billings, sector going profitable. sir, 20 young, quit lungs recover pretty quickly. older get longer smoke, longer takes recover, less recover. Asking forgiveness, permission. Hopefully, hurts industry enough cease exist. antiquated disgusting.

Americans want told everything political agenda idiotic conspiracy theory. mom many places left shop guess. almost we're nation achievements come everywhere completely stupid shit one geographic region Romney said warns businesspeople run politics this, gets brushed off. smarter ones come back months later tell right. 5 months ago real life became interesting fiction. Trump convention worst possible time place. carnage he'll 5,000 voters left, guys loyal death. fact leading epidemiologist country, fathom could spread asymptomatically seems pretty shortsighted. even say ""Well, even though know sure, possible could spread asymptomatically, possible, because, well respiratory illnesses, like flu, example, do."" said ""Nope! need! wear 'em."" Really? Damn though spending 4 months home made catch virus Stubborn idiots surprisingly stubborn. may well keep it. crazy designer virus remains dormant weeks strategically spread every state.

If pandemic shown anything, bioterrorist, really need fancy designer pathogen, old flu dialled lethal well enough given incompetent governments respective citizens seem. dude biggest armchair quarterback history. Captain fuckin obvious God damn dude, clever one.

*Golf Clap*. literally proof, people going paranoid. problem either scenario ends poverty. trying brain storm solutions avoid death *and* mass poverty. 30,000 40,000 people die year lack healthcare access US. income inequality levels seen since robber barron era. US seen avg lifespans drop years healthcare costs skyrocket. US legalized bribery. Worker rights seen evil communism. Corporate welfare celebrated anyone speaks called lazy jealous moocher hates America. police full corruption white supremacists even FBI warned us above. Etc

Yeesh, Faust issues. Fauci really cool dude. Wish someone like country. why? What's logic comparison ""they're neighboring"" countries? simple math this.

With amount new death daily reaching 1k per day, given death lag 2 - 3 weeks, assume mortality rate 0.5%, actual amount new infected cases 2 - 3 weeks ago is:

1000 / 0.005 = 200k new cases per day. way person classes happening classes 30-40 kids get split groups 6-8, group assigned week day go school person classes. Districts right away certain wind go back 100% remote learning due outbreaks. take hospital bills consideration. Otherwise that's two hours care I'd guess (maybe less). like common cold. /s 2 weeks, right? Sweet looking forward videos dealing crackpots! America- Comedy Central  die covid volunteer corpse flung streets demonstration. (As long family ok it) Latest report :

July 16 0:00 -July 17 12:00ÔºàBeijing Time) 5 cases confirmed besides 8 asymptomatic carriers Urumqi, Xinjiang . 

All cases among ppl medical observation blatant greed.

So character Walt Disney's dream.  bring Juno beach lol, actually think anyone would care today's world? Fauci using scientific method, obviously. scientific consensus masks work. contrarian case. made statements backed science, and, *shocker*, came bit ass.  still PPP money available. Today. Stop spreading disinformation. business still apply PPP loan get money day two. Agreed never thought open incognito! Thank Oh don‚Äôt know.  Maybe might catch rona flight get there? üòú seen reported CNN. Everyday. Unfortunately easy get stats police deaths narrowed age range. going work lot less 2 per 1000 people.

You might fairly respond that's odds everyone, opposed stats people get infected. may track people get COVID. Occupy Capitol, everyone gets evicted moves state capitol. 

Or Occupy Capital everyone moves office building. even read meta analysis article riding on? place say masks reduce chance contracting virus 65%. place news report idea he's referencing know kind mask he's talking about: ‚ÄúSo don‚Äôt know might spread it,‚Äù Blumberg said. ‚ÄúWe know social distancing reduces risk transmitting virus 90 percent, wearing masks decreases risk 65 percent.""

To he's clearly talking decrease spreading it, catching it.

The review besically says masks could reduce risk low certainty, bit wear N95 similar respirator. still really vague direct research COVID-19 needed (a huge majority studies review dealt MERS SARS).

In words, summary doesn‚Äôt make claim, also doesn‚Äôt support claim. I'm able work either, forklifts can't driven remotely. sovereign citizens shop now? I'm waiting Vlad host first Amway party.

Anyways, China Russia busy asymmetrical warfare years. Advanced nations care money flowing China could keep western makeup on.

Most people still think war means lead brass propelled barrel. Exactly! effect exaggerated expensive areas.

This issue federal poverty limits. poverty line everywhere, even within state.

I could probably get house 60,000 wanted live desert. metro area California, going least 500,000. many us could even qualify mortgage amount.

And get started rent prices! outrageous! Something something communism helping average citizens something something Venezuela we're handing endless corporate welfare. Last time licked llama kicked head... mean, okay. it'll save corona! Yes that's normally true - state's leadership handling horribly (like Arizona's), overflowing hospitals powerful force make address issue. push patients states, ignore longer create worse problem everyone, particularly themselves. ""You lead horse water, can't make drink."" will, like magic they'll transform back closed. close Nov 4th, pending new information.  vote based ""How make feel?"" vs ""How make think?"" schools closed first don‚Äôt value money, value life.

Even normal working conditions it‚Äôs common office call ask cover class prep period another teacher out.

Most sub teachers country retired old teachers absolutely work conditions.

There arnt enough educated old people death wishes.

Fuck America, embarrassing country is, we‚Äôre still debating climate change real too. saw post someone know fellow, felt bad mocked since really bad guy. I'm going view glass half full suggest death story might help woefully unaware people understand gravity situation. Maybe could even help beguiled fans current government understand badly they've deceived them.  means let's celebrate sacrifice **not did**. attack her. flippant, yes. flippant flippant comment saying ""men trash"". disagreed statement intent behind statement. meeting Chancellor NYC DOE yesterday open parents. site crashed meeting. mess. mean DeSantis attended Yale. let certifications fool you. There's lot systemic loopholes supposed meritocracy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember people saying Trump ""smarter think"" well. He's smart, uses negotiation clout lies deception. Failed casinos, Trump University, every tweet comes egomaniac mouth. real depressing president. Thank you! hoping someone would this.
It's unfortunate today's internet, many articles may well disappear couple years. ""If going hell... keep going.""
-- also Churchill, also relevant here! Walmart seem following. shopping Walmart Putnam CT earlier week. greeter outside thanking mask. Inside, least dozen different shoppers wearing parading around.

The worst, walking (not near) one bakery employees (heavily bearded dude), mask, told female co-worker ""I getting yelled mask"" Saw bearded dude 20 minutes shocking baked goods without mask.

Our state reporting companies violation requires identification person making complaint, may make identity public. So.... ... whistle blower protection either.

If shopping Walmart, advice, skip bakery. Personally, I'm going store help it. called stupid toddler say there's sand ear. Fine, go ahead assume thing true. reality good opportunity prove view Trump wrong view news media wrong. far see, news stories noise.   I'd vote her. like Con DeSatan.

He never said ‚Äúit fact harmful anyone,‚Äù rather ‚Äúthe data suggests.‚Äù mask advisories orgs, preserve masks temporarily frontline workers.

Masks, course, effective reducing spread nearly viruses assuming micron rating sufficient. enough what? wear mask reduces risk spreading 70%. everyone wearing mask percentage people getting infected would 70% less. would way sufficient get things control. admire optimism, pal. Combined anti-mask protests, reopening soon, categorizing non-essential businesses essential, yeah, surprising. trumpets same. keep pointing finger China it‚Äôs way easier holding cult leader accountable catastrophic failure. Also took brief look post history you‚Äôre racist sexist well. surprised. Fox News Viewer new Florida man 10,000 tests, fantastic news High blood pressure genetics.

I see reason issue would different.

Honestly, pretty good value results versus cost may best rapidly changing circumstances like right now. don‚Äôt get dictate discuss process trauma.

You're right, absolutely get tell people process trauma. think healthy unhealthy ways process trauma, say even that? 

I'll tell fear. know world view puts us place oppressor oppressed, know share fear, I'll say anyway. I'm afraid normalize negative points view towards entire groups people based actions individuals road ultimately tear us apart, leading factions decrease size start hate other. 

I'm afraid normalize response, moralize response, we'll start war none us stop. women gets raped starts hating men, lashes man enemy. nothing trauma, traumatized, hates women, lashing women life. black person shot white cop, family holds white people, dehumanizing them. brother shoots white kid reminds cop. white kids cousin decides black people violent criminals, beats another black kid death.

Where end? we're willing assign blame groups, violence hate beget violence hate.

But yes, right, right try censor voice person dealing trauma. belief normalizing response lead dark path. surprised all. 

This nation full serial killers spreading disease willingly reason pure evil. Yup best give up. even try wearing masks. It‚Äôs probably like 5-10% given number undetected cases based serology studies, I‚Äôd agree, nothing done nowhere near peak. last part defies logic. states spiking right also reopened cases low. Go look charts cases per day. places flatlined leading ‚Äúreopening‚Äù. Yet NY still reports hundreds cases day. 

Missouri freaking reported 500-1000 cases every day week. NY reported many cases EVERY day last month. hasn‚Äôt disappeared. friend works TOSHA said like 3 months try work helping people unemployment finally getting back normal job. Biden wins wonder hold people accountable. Kemp Georgia viewed treason.  kids human? Yes! virus spread quickly via host like human? Yes! Yep. still can't call IRS....  Looks like went viral twice Schools countries reopened seen large scale outbreaks schools. happened older students. experience showing might colleges worry person classes yonger people. state like mine Michigan good job person class probably doable . Florida, Texas hotspot even thinking it.

Arnaud Fontanet, head Epidemiology Emerging Diseases unit Institut Pasteur Paris, said ‚Äúgladly‚Äù sent four teenagers back French schools reopened voluntary basis mid-May. emphasized ‚Äúthe virus much circulating France.‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh schoolers still contagious primary school students less contagious zero-risk,‚Äù said. ... Fontanet, Institut Pasteur, lead author twin studies found virus spread high school one French town six primary schools country‚Äôs March fact that's we're stupid fucking headlines like ""coronavirus may airborne"" late pandemic baffling. Several cases anything irrelevant.

Several cases caused number underlying causes sudden total immune system failure, example.

There literally millions COVID-19 infections. those, appears overwhelming majority recover well. fact even question months virus means fucked people fucking retarded, apologise people special needs people think hoax It‚Äôs propublica article. author stance. purpose report ‚Äúabuses power.‚Äù
My point nobody Reddit reading actual transcripts, knows people involved. 
Let‚Äôs judge 15-year-old online based one source.  Especially one has, article, language specifically identifying biased perceived abuses power. I‚Äôm sure judge didn‚Äôt see way teenager did. 
I‚Äôm sure said prisoners. 

I‚Äôm asking people judge here. 
Seems fair stance take universally. Dude again, I‚Äôll talk shit things are, exact second don‚Äôt live pandemic times. I‚Äôll even willingly talk personally overreacting. want whole mess don‚Äôt feel like informed discussion happen happens. sure youre singling hotbed hippie liberal homeo/naturopathic antivax, anti-science, anti-medical beliefs that's fair share damage. Obviously tests done, dragging random people street testing. Read post again. loses election. think he's going try rig it? like anyone would try stop him. Nobody's tried far... filed OSHA complaint employer mid-March. investigated 4 month later, JULY. violations corrected, OSHA said would nothing violations (lack safety equipment, cleaning supplies, exposure COVID). presented five page document proving employer LIED OSHA, investigator said, ‚ÄúWe police, won‚Äôt anything that‚Äù. 

They absent protecting us COVID. live Las Vegas essentially largest COVID exporter world lax following rules Casinos. 

It‚Äôs fucking shame. Truly. CDC OSHA AWOL. I've already forgotten Trump OK Putin killing American soldiers. you? tend think OSHA immediate threats occupation. Employer making drill concrete providing PPE (respirators) role. Employer making work around chemicals allowing know said chemicals hazards them. executive branch majority cabinet. know many 60+ men way less mature 11 year old. Good husband No, conduct studies applicable current situation. US far case per capita Germany also handled situation differently.

Just know multitude studies mask wearing across multiple types environments. That's know effectiveness. Here's review studies: mean, new. Yes. real sure people diminishing long lasting effects. sure hell want spend rest life state vertigo terror.  According nasty manager, lunch. break. need pee that, surprise, you‚Äôre hydrating like be, will, you‚Äôre SOL. simple comparison two discrete situations, correct, they're exactly same. 

Doesn't change fact narrative armed white protestors treated differently armed black protestors afforded rights gonna struggle explaining one. Ah Trump administration taken control corona virus numbers. long til virus 'gone'. Canada would better saying step one re-opening border non-Republican president white house. start thinking next step. Save us papa musk! Yeah tracks. Cruises safe. Fill room, store, bus douche-bags getting collective benefit inconveniences. That's point. Sorry specific enough there. hear that, *Karen*? yea, forfukingever... #buildthatwall republicans pass, try pass, bill hold companies liable workers contracted Coronavirus cut unemployment benefits refused work risky conditions? counties Central Valley starting defy orders months back. Newsom one point threatened close state beaches walk back several county sheriffs refused keep people going beach.

Once saw numbers come projected revenue loss, even realized needed loosen things bit. OSHA rarely proactive agency first place.

Their enforcement power mostly comes ability levy fines fact produce regulations open employers civil suits accident. practice means enforcement mostly goes companies insurers make sure opening liability risk.

I see reason issue would different. perfection Here's thread 70 studies efficacy masks. Muslim countries half population already wearing face coverings better virus? soon? basically, price rich people pay wear mask. human immune system evolving 550 million years. human 550 million years ago. kids get 2 3 meals day school reduced cost.

NYC continued provide kids meals closed schools. Please, stop defending broken system that's exploitative blame business.

You assume that's huge problem, since taking account **human error OSHA still shit except strongarm $75K.**

Edit: Accidents happen time larger corporations, exponential growth, say shit that. We're friends family whose 8-year old got even vaccine. told us vaccine 100%, guess good got young. Oh know it, that's asked it. kind like trying speak women's reproductive rights man, shouldnt it. ZERO say Well like they're anything stop dead bodies piling in. 21? Lmao Slowing spread help drug companies make money. Getting vaccine make money. Since profit involved, pretty well, imaging. Completely understandable pissed. insanely different farm workers rural California forced shoulder-to-shoulder plant spreading within family. 

People ABLE stay-at-home SHOULD. Depends them, part.

A ski mask really good coverage, ski mask mask help prevent regular mask slipping off. It‚Äôs Florida. mature slower something. 5 second ad shows whole meeting. suspicion exercising intensely pre-symptomatic infection. deadly deep intense breathing transmit higher dosage virus delicate lung tissue. want virus start throat/upper airway, alveoli. ‚ÄúI got mine, fuck you‚Äù Teens don‚Äôt political convictions üôÑ

Yeah actually do, might much depth certainly do. 21 year old. normalized? see normalization said above. never heard anyone argue husband rape wife. never heard anyone argue ""she enjoyed it"". anything, see deadly serious rape crime is. I've never heard single person trying normalize rape outside male prisons. 

So again, agree worldview, least society currently live (I'm suggesting parts world many/most happens). believe toxic expectations men women could fight together, believe start fighting together revolve around blaming one gender problems society.

I believe feminism puts lot stock word choice, decided name everything bad world men. believe intended divide us, believe working.

And clarify, shut rape victim support group. group, desire there. responded someone posting message public forum without context saying men pigs, stand by. Yeah, open Disney World too. keep corporate offices closed. lot thread (from gummibear handle Twitter) claims social distancing effective stay home order. great maybe does, say people willing naive fuck plain wrong.

Edit:. ALSO keeps saying virus burbs 15-20% infection rate contradicts later saying places high 43. 

And another thing, dude saying thoughts research done easily manipulated cause like published verified. find neck gaiters perfect hikes. Since outdoors risk less outside, need heavy duty mask, cover face talk maybe, haha. awesome, put around neck pull needed. article‚Äôs title bit misleading though, mostly poll asking border remain closed LEAST end 2020.

Florida continue see least three weeks rises (on 7 day average deaths) though, probably taking real evasive action, State Mecca holidaymakers now.

I think next three weeks bad Florida, following 3 weeks worse. decision made immediately schools open in-person instruction fall. would give us another month plan effectively reach vulnerable kids.

I need get helped now. do? I've suspecting while. Google ""adult add symptoms"". sounds like you, see psychologist. Millions people visit Alabama beaches every year.

Seems like see nowhere else world. Infection scale due large gathering. activities like bar hopping, restaurants, concerts parties. Economic pressure nothing it. Honestly I've never looked forward monday life, sure upcoming one. Mandate masks start nip butt.

AB well while, reason cases spiking like is. know calculated risk given province opened expected. still worrisome see. 

The mask mandate can't come soon enough. TFW Reddit admins ban places like T_D leave subreddits edicated actual life threatening false info alone. paywall. mouth nose openings  I'm sure Florida accept kids. But, comparing per-capita cases US San Marino, population size small US town (34K), would ridiculously unfair.

You're telling San Marino's roughly 1200 deaths per million compare USA's roughly 425 deaths per million San Marino total 49 deaths USA 141,000?

That's crazy, San Marino obviously terribly US best. /s

Honestly though, great point important also acknowledge country's population density urban healthcare infrastructure start comparing ""how we're doing"" compared others. Thank you. drives nuts they're saying ""shattered"" almost every day. would say increase 25% 50% previous record would ""shatter"". like 8% increase.

PPE Basic mask (&lt;n95) wear goggles, typically protective enough complete protection indoor long periods time (aerosol) without fresh air.

Massachusetts, test costs around $160 showing immediate symptoms (coughing, mostly. Fever count unless 101 something). showing symptoms, think test free, provided insurance willing cover it.

My whole gripe I'm sick point I'm coughing lung, there's point getting test already know there's problem. test catch asymptotic people stop spread sooner. So, guys, fucked? Also, someone feels ill long quarantine themselves? Also, point go hospital? Okay thanks. Yeah. personally mind coming campus maybe week staying home four days online. like friends online many show in-class anyways, I'd stay online 100% too. Also think best professors older employees higher risk. 

And frankly, parents think would also force stay online whole time lmao. prefer still use train time being, even well COVID right now. 

I live fairly nearby college planning commuting senior year anyways save money, even COVID hit. Financial report going interesting. Looks like going win win Amazon. Lucky Bezos.  SuperKaren justify Faucis weak spine want. even LOOKS like chinese DNC sellout. resigned instead face US pandemic. main job handle this. failed. FULL STOP number pretty close useless, take age account, huge factor. healthy male 30s, higher chance survival that. senior 80 years old though, might 85% chance survival get infected. Kids would something like 99.975% chance survival.

An interesting thing noticed data day, 100,00 deaths America, 26 age 15. wonder competent Democrat could done whole everything Trump, I'm sure answer ""a damn sight better"" alas Electoral College chose worst person GOP ever floated.

A competent leader, Democrat Republican (like Gov. Hogan Maryland) would‚Äôve humble enough know don‚Äôt know everything, consulted do, make policy decisions based experts say.

They wouldn‚Äôt small fragile ego couldn‚Äôt admit didn‚Äôt know everything try lead response without listening experts feelings accurate science experience, get bored things starting get really bad promote checks notes beans? li bs? THANK YOU!!! Young people vested interest future world, living whatever world create, majority us 18-35 range good wearing masks. I‚Äôm concerned Karen‚Äôs Keith‚Äôs world want send children back school immediately next month. soon IMO number children receiving special education services primarily general education classes almost single digits. It‚Äôs something like 13%. means 87% SpEd students spend least half time general education settings, 63% spend 80% time general education classrooms.

I concede schooling better SpEd students (because universally true almost students currently US), absolutely refute idea ‚Äúbarely retain information.‚Äù absolute majority SpEd students function perfectly fine general education classroom teachers provide appropriate accommodations needs disabilities. Businesses private property. ""Don't Tread me"" types treading people. expect change 4 months? It‚Äôs like Biden starts giving Presidential press conferences (which 4 months), Americans start listening. that‚Äôs call fat cunt. Gonna awesome son's future mental health gets read news stories mom said killed dad. Getting fired bad job? Sorry, sounds like everyone except cops, teachers, priests. Cops get fired unless murder someone camera (not camera) San Antonio anyone familiar. we'd done Yeah, knows he's fucked.

He able win general tens thousands Texans die. able get (R) primary ever takes steps prevent deaths, (R) primaries controlled people Batshit World. There's sidewalk one side street. like said, protesting constitutional right. Btw didnt protest. article says they‚Äôll giving disposable ones entrance sakes, hopefully fluke initial false positive case immunodeficiency. sucks got despite wearing mask, though people said helps protect others protect yourself. Hope pulls through. /r/askhistorians banned genocide denialism.

Gonna butt hurt Americans 20 years article refers young man. *shrug*

Many people reading headline would assume photo young daughter actually son. even know Canadians vaccine. Last read testing Chinese vaccine: vaccine proven effective, Trump et al might claim China stole Moderna; would brand Canada co-conspirator case?! Imagine thinking measly 2K/month enough quit job  Karen‚Äôs application become regional manager Karens.   going down. 0.65% recent revision CDC's earlier 0.26%. indeed premature, people seeing outbreaks  Catalonia moment? mourning advance? last boat sail back Charleston South Carolina March. boarded, Charleston typical. People everywhere. Hustle bustle. Awesome place never been. Sail. 4 days zero internet cell service. Come back. Ghost town. one out. Half places closed ones open, could stay. like indeed went twilight zone. I‚Äôm going real honest you. people probably stayed home. However, thousands New Yorkers headed South spring hung Florida. I‚Äôm seeing lot less car 95 days NY plates compared months ago. I‚Äôd look people skipped town months. us Southerners aren‚Äôt going north right now. least numbers saw back April here. Nope, recommend masks people infected. cases time need recommend masks everyone. Americans got stupid change recommendations. Fucking Karen Hey guys need help here, parents refuse wear masks, can‚Äôt convince wear one. say don‚Äôt wear they‚Äôve done ‚Äúresearch‚Äù clearly don‚Äôt support fact masks work either spreading contracting disease. research links could use evidence guys know of? Tony ‚ÄúBrad Pitt‚Äù Fauci usual, people thinking they're smart tiny bit research nowhere near enough actually educated.

I generally assume know enough truly expert something. stronger convictions, challenge prove they're right search dissenting opinions see change me. Sometimes often don't.

What seems vast majority people latch onto something read tweet Instagrammer *boom* that's them. take gospel close doors mind anything would shake it. read comment hit 3 million cases hit 4 million around July 27th, looks like we‚Äôre gonna hit around Tuesday. No, really. boy office died Fox New storm troopers listen to.  Tell ""looks like forgot something"". probably wrist parking lot shopping autopilot. ‚ÄúWe negative deaths!‚Äù  much Mitch McConnell made mind new bills going Senate. Remember New York reported 1,000 deaths one day sub said nothing? Rockefeller donated five years publicity gave up. husband pretty thin college mother kept complaining looked like holocaust victim.

He tad lean maybe sense could put muscle, dang lost like 60 pounds freshman year. know /supposed/ look like. teenage kids eat drink? doesn‚Äôt specify don‚Äôt know. Still someone relatively young. mention anything protesters? Trump's winning issue recently economy. He's resisted shutdowns start opening things again. 

 reason tried bypass CDC hospital COVID information. way, spin data make things look better economy start again.

Look changes data people dying pneumonia COVID. sycophant (DeSantis) FL already tried it. Thank service country. crucial USPS delivering pandemic lost life service others. RIP data points fucking place. literally post one saying set record 71k, world meter 74k America, rely billion dollar corporations create health mandates. allowed CDC put data already back website. They're giving new data. believe Harris Teeter part Kroger group. believe heard report along Smith‚Äôs Dillons. Unless get prompt results, doesn‚Äôt matter. wait 1-4 weeks test results, useless contain spread virus, doesn‚Äôt even matter test 100k unless give results within 24-48 hours. (not all) fellow newly 30 year old social circle chilling home. worried summer rolled around would decline invitations hang out, barbecues ""because outside"" such, immediate friend group pretty surprisingly good. sure. don‚Äôt send school don‚Äôt. endangering kids. want hair kids probably don‚Äôt many resources.  don‚Äôt think choice, think school vaccine pay whoever caregiver child stay home. this, doesn‚Äôt grand stressful thing. Things stressful enough. Okay read little, math, computer game, laughs kids online. basics. Nothing make kids/or parents unnecessary stress. lost year. focus keep kids safe.  govt hurting people stick together. Keep kids home protect kids. Well I'm making usually make. I'm getting far less unemployment. still know point trying make. state governor suing mayor Atlanta mandating mask. hate break you, one cares I‚Äôll go ahead copy timeline Trump‚Äôs failures.

Edit spelling

Edit added defense production act china travel restrictions things

Edit - Thanks awards first. Instead awarding though donate local races need won. know another redditor probably nice list great people donate to. mean... sucks? Young people considerate, old, cause frankly owe anything (other basic darwinian success), consideration young people compromised immune systems. We‚Äôve falling since us born. It‚Äôs outwardly visible coming head current presidency. Sorry man. know shit ton virus research. sister covid, obvious symptoms smack dab middle international hot spot (Phoenix AZ). told 2 day waiting period go drive testing, 7-10 days results.

She's sick 8 days (yes, stubborn) rapidly declining.

And also told bother showing ER unless oxygen levels consistently 90...they absolutely are, unless sitting resting.

This horrifying. 

And around family. father law hospice care Covid Phoenix. They've given treating he's 97. 

I get that, that's right decision medical workers point. completely mentally sound good life strong relationships right bullshit. family taken visiting hospital trying say goodbye outside hospital window. He's far gone know there...what complete bullshit way die lifetime serving country loving family. 

Jesus christ, horrifying. White‚Äôs daughter, Shalisa, died Tuesday falling California home. boyfriend rushed hospital, matter hours, gone doctors say caused COVID-19""

huh? really need info. dont care trump thinks, speaks superlatives anyway. I'm talking actually happened, contradicting tweet 2013. responsible many deaths Dem watch probably either. Ngl album pretty good article Fauci, Trump know people see question assume dismiss seriousness virus, 26 year old pre-existing conditions, like know young people hospitalized match mine. So, anyone know preexisting conditions? Yes 'no GOP'. According Joseph Atwill, Christianity used Romans purposes psychological manipulation pacify poor justify slavery.  point use religion manipulate populace goes back Christianity's founding years, roughly two millennia ago. 

A big problem us power marketing, ability money polish turd well enough looks desirable. God damn, believe karma probably compelling evidence I've ever seen. Peaking implies start going down. There's reason think happen. Hardly states taken measures would cause cases go down, going happen naturally. faithfully served

denouncing known effective coronavirus treatment time peak pandemic fear

sounds like ""national hero"" would do... protect profits invested different drug... budget airlines die, it. I'm willing make sacrifice

I'm sure one. Budget airlines account millions jobs. I'm ready suffer little flight discomfort means millions get keep employment. Yea but....are honestly surprised it‚Äôs turning way? white house version numbers real ones? buried look good Donald Trump. People dying stay jail. vote thing standing us lifelong hell. Dude LA like 59. That‚Äôs nothing Use brain, bud. Even knew understood said that: low supplies. want people stockpile masks first allocated medical professionals. science also understood. think telling Americans wear masks one failures pandemic, biggest one comes person sitting oval office. It‚Äôs ‚Äúhis watch‚Äù though. We‚Äôre watch sociopathic moron POTUS minions couldn‚Äôt make harder Fauci tried. He‚Äôs effective kick ass job, job, despite them. blowback heartless greed reopening spreading virus $$$ open week two could end costing company lot next year later. (removing scientific data) EPA website day Trump inaugurated. couldn‚Äôt fucking believe it.

Fuck Scott Pruitt. Again, Fox news exists there‚Äôs audience it. catering folks made minds long time ago. That‚Äôs there‚Äôs critical discourse. Make mistake. Old people want hear already believe. dad one em. Thanks friend model, even highest end, predicted would seeing number deaths per day now. insane. think toilet paper hand sanitizer hoarders harmed whole mask debate. Let‚Äôs send kids back school. WCGW think issue (if I'm understanding article correctly) insight hospital capacity missing. States/local govts reporting Covid19+ hospitalizations CDC provided info total %ICU capacity example. extremely important determining reach tipping point hospitals overrun actually happens. lol dad? social media wanted blogger dad super idea that. high school started blogging seriously starting make money still understand. Now, 11 years graduating high school he's wondering start Youtube lol Fatality rate guide anything meaningful. Still got 1000 dead yesterday, nearly another 1000 today. country worse Brazil.

How many dead people OK *rate* you?

And case, rate getting worse, better. proportionally gaining deaths faster cases now. expect continue exceed records set NY/NJ know everyone wants this, don‚Äôt think possible POTUS issue national mandate. zero supply available anywhere like week 1, believe bad call. Regardless, thats bad call thats bad. End day, insignificant part population refuses wear anyway. like recommending would helped more. goal protect people front line ones capable helping rest us. Fact is, time, one better information. failure guy refusing listen updated recommendations new information arrived. People expect science correct first time thats works like *think* bible does. issue morons go sake going sticking rest us. 

If weren‚Äôt around, we‚Äôd done. Trump far worse. Kemp real SOB made business keep low I'm surprised Georgia lasted long reopen stole ? Iceland bit unfair comparison. 350,000 people compared 330 million ish USA. Stay safe, I‚Äôm PA entire family back home Georgia. THEYRE GOOD GEESE BRANT!!!

Now trainers, hand Along every disease expert around globe. America pea tree dish Treatment trials usually go pretty fast since it‚Äôs obvious it‚Äôs working side effects manifest quickly mother got pneumonia cruise Northern Europe July 2006. take heat - supposedly hottest summer record ended hospital Copenhagen. treated wonderfully, little pay end 4 day stay lived another 7 years age 82. 

That's learned extreme heat dangerous extreme cold. Check family neighbors, please. would good thing, unrealistic happen without government supplementation. Small businesses struggling, lot verge closing doors. can't raise employee salaries  Okay, bot. go away now. thick pandemic hospitals afraid overrun deprioritizing many types patients, including elective surgery, one main sources income hospitals.

Hospitals specifically paid reported Covid-19 cases make lost income.

Hospital administration concerned making hospitals money.

Doctors across country saying pressured report Covid-19 cause death detected even determined cause death.

I'm sure adds according math. Remember fatass said 12 cases gonna turn number 0. Yeah look aged. several years Trump, knowing thin-skinned tantrum babies, unfortunately waiting start, especially Fauci hide ridiculous Trump's rants deep state were. wrong subreddit? Something positive regarding Sweden? says guy whose country worst hit pandemic. People want economy going strong, want wear masks limit cases? Go turtle! 4th July another major event country willing bend knee....

It going massive spike loss life start ringing infections. believe looking states completely collapsing financially destabilization state governments. get pandemic made hate America revealed shittiness , planning move US Speaking ~~outside~~ inside America, it‚Äôs weirdest fucking thing politicized. Right opposing sides reach across aisle, clasp hands get work.

Like there‚Äôs neighbour hate petty neighbour things. kid goes missing. put aside petty shit roll sleeves join search. day-to-day, extraordinary travesty. time act like human beings. clicked link reread it, took sickle... legit don‚Äôt get oh mighty movement people thinking better everyone.  People someone please show number two months ago numbers now. Look north East numbers going dramatically cause used brains everyone wears masks working together get shit taken care it‚Äôs working . yet good chunk country acts like one found ways control Perfect Numbers! Ok. What‚Äôs ideology? Yeah...petitions really work leader reasonable person. Cost?!? guys pay? WTF. wonder it‚Äôs exploding way is. Something maybe explains this, 20-29 year olds arent less responsible, going back work economies reopen. Higher proportions age range work high risk jobs retail food service.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'll raise 100K 50K /s again. Economics. 

Their best interests keep costs relatively high cost labor place tax concessions doesn‚Äôt bode well jobs. 

Again you‚Äôve seen raising minimum wage automation taking jobs. speak ideals don‚Äôt work practice what. 

And take exec pay divide amount workers. Congrats ‚Äî you‚Äôve given everyone marginal raise. execs provide immense value business worth price. Yeah, unemployment runs end July, unfortunately I'll likely still family, means likely I'll still havento support them. 

Most likely. people admit people like right something. Even things trivially provable ""MOUTH COVER BLOCK GERM DUST"". It‚Äôs good Boston I‚Äôm there. south shore....it‚Äôs okay compliance. People wear masks going store people outside Ive seen good chunk wearing masks. whole good. Gotta stay vigilant. Hopefully outbreaks south keep way.

Give credit Governor Baker. Republicans attacking month two ago eat shit done terrific job. Seriously proud Gov. often you‚Äôll hear say Republican. Dennis Rancourt? that? like push? I've never even heard person dont ""push"" anything lol u must confused someone else First never ended USA.. European, Korean and. . . .Walmart? Come on. . . .dont reduce already shitty America even shittier walmart. . . please? One word Trump, quote Mary Trump: ""Resign!"" Scientists probably answers, incompetent leadership preventing right actions taken. Listen tests scientists talking school morning child could spit piece paper find within minutes infected not.

Millions people this, daily, tests could cost one dollar each. tests little less accurate edges, yes, matter, they're accurate enough really matters.

This coming autumn *does be* disaster! attitude, individualism, selfishness, arrogance &amp; lack trust information failed US, Asian societies based values Confucius, work group, make sacrifice greater good, western societies members emphasize one's-self center. US far end spectrum this.  learn days. number goes down, might due backlog. goes up, oh well üòî Better Brad Pitt. Cover TIME next! love man poor reaction much US containing virus leading indicator US decline world power come. result failings public education system proliferation right wing extremist echo chambers traditional media social media discourage intellectual critical thought substituting conspiracy theories skepticism field-leading experts scientists.

Mask-acne? Let get violin... mask (if N95) really protects around wearer wearer unfortunately.  He's 79 years old! would never guessed! Off-topic, still important. Space force! Probably someone projecting White House concealing data pay workers read studies UBI, like program Ontario going on. Participants eating better, going back school, getting medication needed able work getting jobs.

The current system cost ton maintain. 100s welfare programs people low income. need ton resources determine much person get EI, welfare, disability, housing etc. take money use give every person make $250k something $2000 month. enough rent room, buy groceries, pay bill, survive. want extras work it. 

The billionaires paying little taxes great place start increasing taxes pay program well. Bullshit. Worker productivity increased exponentially wages stagnant since 1970s. We've always means pay people more. Given taken well week get results back, confirm effing majorly. 

By time get result back, could either spread others get negative back exposed intervening days waiting test... it‚Äôs ridiculous turns everybody circled wrong day. problem July 31 Friday, states pay unemployment benefits based weeks end Saturday Sunday. result, last week month won‚Äôt actually covered $600 top off. extra cash disappear July 26 every single state.

Yea, I'm sure mistake ... /s Better late never, better early late. can't let guy hook, he's still responsible far many deaths. I'll throw congrats :) yeah alcohol makes big contribution.

My friends made fun factoring alcohol diet, realized: 1: alcohol effect I've eaten less day make room it, 2: sweet bod look after. Unblock man Alright let‚Äôs blame ‚Äúout state assholes‚Äù. matter time..right? Oh look accept apology. also needed actual policies help people like rent forgiveness. 20 million plus facing possibility eviction. People got one $1200 check 3 months ago. proven pushing agenda facts science. Tbh nervous hypochondriac 20s, turned okay I've become way blase 30s. Like basically stopped exercising months back keep thinking I'm somebody exercises regularly I'm not, time passes quickly suddenly long time since remotely fit. Haha. Dont worry wont need it. 90% optimistic. Dude literally waived away first hand evidence said. one disengenous you. feels bad last four months quarantine meant... basically nothing. City makes law, governor makes law city law, city says law applies anyway, governor sues city...

Hey Einstein, look chart smallpox, polio, mumps, varicella, literally vaccine have...look date vaccine created, notice four months later virus still prevalent...it takes years, decades eradicated. 

But dopes r/coronavirus keep saying can't wait year, cant wait til January? Well exact conversation whether there's vaccine mean he's truly responsible for, beyond effective. bullshit filter goes moderately effective. 

Its incredible he's able use president's prized soap box week week convey safe ( least half country) people like sleep night?

/s 31, Arizona. I‚Äôm one one friends staying home. 100% know people bars sick. 

I feel like read folks age blaming boomers (and won‚Äôt say they‚Äôre perfect either) definitely see majority cases Arizona come young it‚Äôs essential workers. lockdown? I'm summer job left house month march April may. non-essential businesses closed cerfews riots Reminds title question much, see states continues devolve, plus town officially still covid does, would easily shut town while. poo poo mask thing long time? want gamble dignity skill learn technical analysis trade options. still go buy hookers afterwards. Make sure use digital thermometer make sure wears mask. kidding. get idolization. many people died shitty, possibly corrupt, advice? girlfriend really wants go across state lines mom birthday. mom many illnesses, would danger her. recommended FaceTime, order gift flowers. time visit later blows over. She‚Äôs throwing tantrum like hour mean am. 

I wish people would try inform severe pandemic is. :( mean, fuck it, everyone else making facts days. reading several articles like watching videos, think within 4-6 weeks NYC flooded cases. Reddit learned stop putting moderately charismatic people oppose Trump pedestals? usually bites back later Still seeing consistent decreases 7 day average new cases Arizona. Hang guys youre almost going put supporting stance like? google ""cei economist attitude poll minimum wage"". pop up. Also acknowledged source refutation, minimum wages actually address poverty. Honestly. one deserves cancer. rest country set new wave

*Narrator:* never second wave...because first wave never ended.  mentality life value needs stop. 

Who knows much damage he, people like him, done? Hopefully dies quickly. L.A. County going take Fl TX alone. get idolization guy. admit essentially lying mask usage early on? many deaths attributed people listening wearing masks months?

My heroes lie bail going gets tough. Nah, company always scum including Walt running it. current directors even think shutting parks, Walt's frozen head lurch cryonic chamber sunken city R'Lyeh, rocket Disney boardroom, butt stomach decide keep things open all.  Kindly plead stupid family, determined get sick least u/undeleteparent race bottom largest nations Americas really stop. 

It's sad happening. utterly appealing leaderpship Team Fauci next day is... Tennessee. 40 minutes outside Nashville. double checked math right, made honest mistake. admit still offensive discrepancy. like late April. then, definitely enough info whether one wear mask not. would understand March negligence. strive power go without compromise! like can't shortness breath. goes full Karen 5 health reasons can't wear mask. Never history mankind troubled soul ever plagued problems covering mouth thin material. I'd certainly rather calling shots Trump made many missteps. lost mother cancer, horror wish anyone.

But Rush Limbaugh anyone. 

I hope doctors keep alive long possible order keep suffering.

Death good so-called man. Keith received presidential medal freedom last republican administration, highest honor bestowed civilian

For though?

They claim respected person field.

My actual brother doctor commander 10th medical wing fo USAF - charge 80,000 - direct flight surgeon joint chiefs staff pentagon 9/11 head entire VA Alaska... 

Im kinda familiar such... (albeit familiar... brother thing) -- never literally heard guy prior.

I understand insturmental within aides epidemic... Ill look that...

But brothers record colonel, joint chiefs, pentagon, Irag/afgh deployments VA head.... - dunno... guy reveared???

I doubting... want actual info. worked medicine (only tech side) long time... can't judge - evaluate data provided.... doubt it. 

5,500 cases one time add.

i think struggle get 75k tomorrow. still enormous number but.......im sure testing keep up. good thing healthcare system going improve next election /s could get arrested this? 21. one claims 21 year olds don‚Äôt spread virus. 

Stop it. Correct, atleast probably correct
A months ago CDC discouraging average people wearing masks ya probably public inside people u live 2020 late. Fauci '24. Make happen Why? Hes world renowned epidemiologist. Even said understatement. want smart people trust themselves. Especially trump. super confident wither trumps abuse. time, need smart people speak up. dumbfucks like trump Republicans Looks like Dewey grown _ Malcolm Middle I‚Äôm NYC felt like April sure. Things may fabulous now, drastically better. Hang there. Seriously though testing keeping pace cases? Things possibly get worse keeping things open. said takes weeks see results mask bar order. already 3 weeks bars 2 weeks masks things improving all. many weeks dumbass need realize lockdown thing work. Lol Thanks we've hardly coronavirus cases No. would never stay him. mostly hospitals tiny regional centers, caring small towns. 3-4 true hospitals whole state. barely 2 million people covering 121k Sq Mi. that's 17 people per sq mile. true area least. hospitals Central Valley dad sees patients seeing rise cases, shuffling patients alternative branches, cancelling non-essential surgeries  August 14th.... 100k cases day. Who's got under? warned people may sports foreseeable future? going years months. even left first wave. fucked flattening curve completely, we're experiencing resulting surge. 

[And death rate INCREASING actually preparing spike...again...just expected, rise cases. Read ""lag time bias"". 

The second wave going hit us least Winter. Lol there's little doubt regardless many cases direct result protests(anti maskers blm), protests pandemic doctors pleading people stay home generally good idea. 

Im finding hard find anything argue here. Guy's got saw roof, rightfully Upvoting feels gross. hate agree you. can't believe situation in. husband hitting you? new Stimulus plan needed now. 2500 month per adult paid 2018-2019 taxes (that rule, dont get angry me) December (with new strain talked about)

seriously..maybe 250 month per person aid Foodstamps EBC cards good grocery stores. cash refunds. Yeah HE‚ÄôS one ego. don‚Äôt know people sometimes something numbers. hiding them? saying done 830k tests month ago outcome would same? 

I rest case really need Facebook step plate stop crazy ‚Äúanti-maskers it‚Äôs hoax‚Äù bullshit posts. would start! fantastic!

That's modest thing think. Let alone say. Gave benefit doubt reread original comment. mentioned one person. know wasn‚Äôt already one asymptomatic person heading home? person layover airport gave local airport employee spread further? You‚Äôre going get Coronavirus cases inevitably, even admit opened April. didn‚Äôt explode months later, means wasn‚Äôt much begin spread without mitigated lockdown stricter social distancing measures, again, states. fuck, dont look forward next flu..i super careful washing hands ridiculous amount times, home time, social distancing, wearing mask showering undressing clothes covid.

Reality worse, government hospital CEOs actively suppressing facts. system turned us. two cents people valuable economy consumers producers. Old people still spend money gov programs supplement long term care. Possibility pandemic Medicare program need less money everyone already dead would receiving care otherwise. Gov‚Äôs Medicare surplus wider economy‚Äôs loss (speaking US perspective). Early inheritances also lead wider racial wealth gap.

Obviously requirement massive consumption sustain economy bad numerous reasons, really current reality. live Florida.

That's interesting claim one frankly suspect correct. want source show skeptical friends. looks like link got buried. Y'all get ready 2021.. futures bright Fauci's gotta wear shades!  Hey it‚Äôs kind weird stagnating wages, unaffordable housing, unaffordable medical care, loss millions good jobs replaced gig economy, record student loan debt made young people go starve get evicted. know got downvoted since bad theory imo.
that said, think hotspots going cool soon, imho take longer time radical local gov. reaction must occur trigger (there nothing yet). also - waiting 4th july effect.
I bet 100k per day end next week, unless testing significantly reduced.

after that, even people start wearing masks (thank Walmart, target others!) reopen schools end August sure go bad (it seems schools ignore fact virus PROBABLY spreads via areozol), flu season kicking off...

‚Äã good bad news like often days (which better old standard bad news time). 

**Good news**: considering expanding use masks. 

**Bad news**: damn reason want waste millions kroner reinvent wheel. **That makes sense**. There‚Äôs already tons papers showing masks work, even [than linkdump]( Germany pretty much definitively proven masks work](http://archive.vn/yN2bL). also means Swedes won‚Äôt change masking regulations fall earliest. Ridiculous. Another article support clickbait yet hard data prove asymptomatic spread¬†‚Äì¬†transmitting virus without displaying symptoms¬†‚Äì Shekerdemian said there‚Äôs nothing suggest ‚Äúthe lack symptoms doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt transmit it.‚Äù


The data consistently shown weaker symptoms strongly correlate less virus spread.

While child transmission certainly possible common we'd data support now. Ohhhh lmao nevermind  20 percent testing antibodies, antibodies wane detectable levels bit time, form immunity. levels natural immunity... whatever label put it, higher number immune individuals population, slower spread. Rona DeathSentence? There's great many factors went wrong, start blame game *somewhere*. took Florida becoming global epicenter virus. still actually pass statewide mask order, pretend get way local leaders actually job his. Swing Florida get too... I'm specialist realm, probably misspoke. absolutely airborne coronavirus absolutely starts lungs. 

However, least I've read, people show hospital SpO2 levels 80s zero signs pneumonia. textbook ""happy hypoxia"" least understand.

I wonder neurological problems linked sustained low SpO2 levels *specifically* virus, makes sense. virus may directly attacking brain, another side-effect lowered blood oxygenation long period time. Takes one bad seed ruin rest us ugh........... even worry it, poster magically know everybody else. They're spitballing. Happy cake day D'uh! actually good speller. However one mistake likely Covid candidate make! rhyme well too! ü§≠  There‚Äôs LOT money backed top vaccines. It‚Äôs already produced stockpiled hazard guess~ there‚Äôs way it‚Äôs going rolled out..

China already giving military vaccine, effectiveness unknown. response cultists declare numbers fake hospitals getting money, hypothesis evidence. Manhattan Beach name town.

Not saying I'm smarter Harvard hot shot, anecdotal evidence tends agree CDC head.

Flyin' SARS BARS! shit Sherlock. tell experts check Reddit, we'll save ton time. crisis actors going full method-acting. Depends mean effective. seasonal influenza virus prevent infections 30%-40% cases, reduces symptom severity 80% rest. think Covid vaccine ballpark would still enough restore life know (assuming large portion population get vaccinated protective measures remain place vulnerable). personally think Covid vaccine effective influenza need predictive multiple strains problem now, would still get wasn't. Nordstrom, Macys clothing retailers probably next Working Texas. Blue Flame Medical, sells medical items. popped around March so, supplies seized FEMA mysteriously going states. think Kushner ties BFM?

To say least, suspicious. aren‚Äôt. White House seized data spoon feeding narrative. CDCs hands tied here. government seizes control info like this, get really really scared. ask chuds, they'll say bodily autonomy limiting state control, even begin scratch find \^ underneath.

Republicans feeding bodies capitalistic growth machine. Companies literally willing kill millions people order keep profit margins growing (not flatlining, slightly decreasing...growing). Honestly, want played.

Imagine fans would feel player like Patrick Mahomes Lamar Jackson catch virus, deal career altering effects like scarred lungs. beloved coach like Andy Reid caught passed away.

The real way would confine players staff training centers. Nobody in, nobody out. would agree that? something somewhat good? Yes, courts use current laws justify positions. laws changed might come different conclusion. Although know, might protest. We're opting cull people instead. really think fair states taking seriously keeping numbers low forced shut states? Johnballlin..

The majority couples experienced corona crisis positive effect relationship, new study shows. lot couples learn recent months, experts say.


The fear great country [Denmark] closed four months ago.

Parents sent home work, children allowed go school kindergarten, several predicted would marked increase number divorces couples going apart.



But case.


In new survey conducted Gallup Berlingske among 486 representatively selected adult Danes relationship, 87 percent answer corona crisis predominantly positive effect relationship.


The remaining 13 percent answer crisis predominantly negative effect.


""It's really interesting. really, really many gotten better corona crisis, ¬´says Neela Maria Sris, psychologist psychology house Encounter external associate professor psychology University Copenhagen.


The figures confirm psychologist couple therapist Thomas Markersen's experiences. several couples therapy corona crisis, crisis close divorce, decided stay together.


""I seen several couples gotten much better talked things everyday life hits again,"" says.


An equal number women men answer study corona crisis positive effect relationship.


13 percent answer time corona positive, three percent answer negative.


Most couples aged 60 experienced positive effect result corona crisis.


Here, 95 percent answer crisis positive effect.


For couples ages 36 59, 87 percent answer experienced positive effect, applies 79 percent 18 35-year-olds.


At time, new statement Family Court shows corona period immediately led divorces.


In March, April May year, fewer divorce cases compared months last four years.


In June, slight increase 1,706 cases 2019 1,718 cases 2020, number still lower 2016, 2017 2018.


""There continuous decline applications separation divorce recent years, immediately nothing special figures first months 2020,"" says S√∏ren Aakj√¶r Gam, office manager marriage Family Court, press release.


According two psychologists, overriding reason many couples experienced positive effect corona crisis spent time together.


‚ÄúSpeed high everyday life slowed corona crisis. may sound banal, time together important. may gone several trips together, maybe got know different way spent quality time together. conversations taken place one dishes sitting front computer.


You actually time look eyes, ""says Neela Maria Sris.


Thomas Markersen adds: ‚ÄúWe live society competes much attention forget give love attention. One actually quantify love. requires x number hours together, otherwise withers. think due everything else. Quarrels one fit together, woman give sex. attribute everything fact spend enough time together. '



Remember stick positive things


The couple therapist says several couples therapy said number things everyday life hits again.


""It done now, see difficult hold good things learned corona crisis, important try,"" says, adding: ""Many men spoken say spend time children. example, coached man crisis slightly strained relationship son, excellent relationship agreed spend least hour half quality time son without mobile phone computer.


As rule, also good relationship, woman often think bad relationship rift relationships family. ""The advice Neela Maria Sris couples sit talk , good. already vaccines another strain coronavirus, thats taken fast develop vaccine covid. remember correctly situation applied swine flu back 2009/2010.

There's also something called mra vaccines work entirely different dead DNA vaccines. 1 case? Wow. Good news Exactly. interpreted differently meant. Still, ways interpreting untrue. Capitalism entered chat. It‚Äôs okay! Like president said, test less, less new cases! Adhd go away get older. People need quit making excuses kids getting many young people ignoring masks rules right now. kid knew get thrown there. still ? Probably judge job. People making excuses kid probably plenty free time lockdown homework ridiculous. link dump, couple articles showing masks work corona large effect. Unless point one shows large effect. No. blow blow everyone's flu infection? Psychologically American people, probably right. think economy would fare better half assed closures unenforced mask policies vaccine developed vs. militantly enforced 4 6 week lock down, clue talking about. I'm envious people make policies enforce this. 


I simply want point people complying common sense measures stop virus claiming reason they're taking seriously need get back work jump start economy. Well, Goldman Sachs analysts right, enforcing mask mandates cause additional 5% shrinkage economy top inevitable recession that's horizon. Fixing economy stopping virus aggressively possible, ignoring hoping go away. reason countries get reopen start economy virus gone. I'm region hospitals starting send people show back homes die beds full - hallmark healthy economy ever saw one.


Did countries really ""immediately"" reopen 1-2 months people got bored quarantine? wait caseload manageable contact tracing infrastructure set reopen? basically focus one thing want dismiss everything else said done.

It single biggest public health policy disaster history. Lying public masks ineffective directly responsible people STILL refusing wear now, continue result deaths. Yes. dumbass? US(or place really) legally require people get shot? people willing wear mask months think take shot?

I asking serious question. read weeks ago might need get times year keep us safe trust people enough work. Someone needs take one team end piece shit. Scaled fines adjusted income. way it‚Äôs merely tax rich douchebags pay keep offending actually effective. Reported dangerous hospital behavior OSHA, refused anything used wrong name form. I've felt way whole time. get sick, it'll likely never get reported unless start trouble breathing. Thank you. Hey, that‚Äôs true, Border Patrol ICE putting final touches full brownshirt organisations always wanted be. talking Indonesia. think part evidence virus may able cross blood/brain barrier scariest part. 5% patients severe neurological issues also pretty damn scary. Thank goodness came senses. Better embarrassed guilt-ridden crying mom‚Äôs grave later. Exactly thought. I‚Äôd rather dead get stuck bill. let science stand way, it'll pile dead teachers students standing way. ‚ÄúWe must throw overboard achieved. Viruses still here‚Äù
I couldn‚Äôt agree more.

So I‚Äôm getting bit worried Denmark here. article doesn‚Äôt mention it‚Äôs *few* days around 30 new cases per day today there‚Äôs **49** reported, double average last week. math couple days ago regions increases:

Copenhagen 4070 4007 == 1.57 %

Central Jut 1258 1252 == 0.48 %

Northern Jut 1003 973 == 3.08 %

Zealand 2457 2430 == 1.11 %

South DK 886 858 == 3.26 %

It‚Äôs probably related tourism would guess, Germans south Swedes Zealand/Copenaghen. Northern Jutland one may outbreak Hj√∏rring still spreading. seems pretty clear Denmark walk back staged reopening regions [Europe‚Äôs worst hotspot: Sweden]( it‚Äôs late. guess ban Luxemborgians that‚Äôs tiny nation nearby etc. Usually city provided surfaces like water/trash tied home used put lien home unpaid. Things like TV/internet/electricity tied person - landlord worry those.

Probably varies location.... people scum. Like record baby, right round round round. Name checks out. Thanks science. Yup. feeling like stranger strange land. taught land land, manipulation Guthrie's anti-fascist theme land everyone's land (in sense one really owns it). 10,000 years (recorded history wise) Native Tribes fished sustainably, never overpopulation problems. might reached great heights quickly like industrialization effectively sterilized natural progressions tribal societies advent colonization large.

I refuse call society know natural evolution, amount artificial, deliberate, decisions cause mass suffering denial reality behest thousand nepotistic rich white families, running shit long decided paper metal worth time energy.

Did say otherwise? Herd immunity specific term threshold immunity whereby virus grow spread naturally.

Pockets immunity herd immunity. Halfway threshold herd immunity immunity. It‚Äôs accurate quote. 

‚ÄúWhen says open, means open full, kids able attend every day school. science stand way this."" highest risk get it, identified scientific data. believe data says go essential workers, nurses, nursing homes.

Yes, statistically estimate true number cases accurately better testing. fair comparing timelines tech processes 1967 2020 agree next year probably realistic release anytime year hardly think it‚Äôs accurate expect long time production negatives authoritarian regime none positives. People get revenge Karens everywhere. dude science hard. drink it, coats tummy. I'd say smoking it, probably free basing easiest way get lungs. Read science book, pal. Hahaha fuck people still wanting vote people. Smh  gonna give time, corona catch covid probably even know lol  Congrats commas buddy. Since adamant ""facts"" keep ejaculating to, provide link support point.

Not would waste time looking I'm ""ignorant"", may beneficial future reddit endeavours. much effective tactic rather saying look lol Giant swab nose v sniffed pup? Easy decision.

Seriously though crowd situations like sporting events? big ones canned tuna chicken, canned soup chili, spaghetti + sauce, peanut butter, crackers, bunch canned fruits veggies, unsweetened applesauce, oatmeal, dehydrated milk, protein powder, canned beans, ramen, salsa, jars jalape√±os, tortillas, boxed mac cheese, trail mix, assortment spices sauces, 10lbs rice. also filled 5 gallon water containers take camping every year; probably unnecessary, harm so.

I'm sorry can't see friends family. hope everyone know stay safe healthy this. evidence assertions?

Kids get Covid. Kids less likely major symptoms/complications adults Covid. Kids spread Covid. Kids bring Covid home parents/grandparents. They, turn, likely suffer major symptoms/complications also spread Covid co-workers.

The evidence assertions like ""kids can't spread Covid"" ""kids can't get Covid"". Kids died Covid already negates second assertion. Schools opened shut breakouts, parties led breakouts evidence negates first assertion.

I'm hoping completely misunderstood side calling stupid typed nothing. annoying reading thing every day ""Kids spread Covid-19."" ""Masks help prevent spread"". many lies spread Covid (even straight Whitehouse) educated keep repeating obvious help negate lies. per-capita rate new cases nearly double country whole.

Thats sidelined? axe catching contests risky covid even point anymore? There's actually term called post-viral anosmia explains this. tend see viral respiratory infections may caused influenza strains, rhinoviruses, coronavirus strains. wholly unique covid-19   saw day fox news stated states double counting cases. dont believe one bit. However, Virginia acknowledged something back May 4. Fox news made claim Florida might thing. 

 dont know fox news would mention something two months later. one know anything situation? would like mention dont watch fox news all. hear clips people house watching it.  Even though dislike politics ways, i¬¥m happy Merkel chancellor now, really good job leading Germany crisis. founded patent attorney. Trump killing base lol Check post history.

Come again? Finally. late though Another fake frivolous whistleblower! maybe wait totals gloating?

we +62,000 worldometers 6 pm east coast. yesterday worldometers posted +73,388 yesterday, deciding include backlog Bexar County. 

5 states yet report in. nearly 18,000 short 80,000.

California probably 7-9k cases yet report in. Texas probably short thousand well. lets say 3k.



that 12,000 cases. really think Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, Idaho, Hawaii going combine 6k?

edit: 2 states + texas cali left. 16k short 80,000. unfortunate position rooting way cases expected win argument internet.

the counties missing Cali's total *right now* yesterday contributed 5,000. 

the ones missing Texas maybe 2,000. lets generous concede 4,000 there.

16,000 -5000-4000 = 7000.

The US testing rate 18x Canada: 

Canada \~1/10 population US.

Most cases early outbreak, probably vast majority them, never counted testing limited (in countries).

A better metric look deaths per capita. Canada currently 234, comparable Florida (224, although may certainly go higher), Virginia (236), South Carolina (213).

Texas 133 California 190. Typical parent: Karen's kid special COVID-free; everyone else go hell.

People make choices based whatever reasons value. want to, make choices ultimately so. using government crutch bad choices disingenuous absolve consequences choices.

Personally, believe would call something ""society"" even ""societal norms"" (if guess correctly, please correct I'm wrong) would label ""Patriarchy"". think societal norms directions much harder pin simplifying ""Pen power"". see ""Men"" group power general statement see oppressed. Historically true individual men filled positions power much greater numbers (almost exclusively recent history) women, individual men lives carelessly thrown away much women history. Personally see society one that's engineered benefit men whole, rather engineered benefit powerful top % people, norms expectations product crazy complex history can't begin unravel.

Anyway, understand that's worldview, looking debate particular thing, cool. let's say individuals culpability actions inactions, including example masturbating raped child. pretend excuse people's behavior, claim blameless failings society. take issue though assigning blame solely based group membership (but suspect lies different opinions collectivism vs individualism).

That's anecdotal prove anything! selfish asshole even sharing dangerous propaganda! People DYING!

Ha! see idiots! kinds young people dying proves it! genetic herd thinning need, people wear mask mentally inferior! I'm sure allowed link here, BBC site article called ""In pictures: coronavirus swept Brazil."" pretty powerful stuff. Someone close OSHA Director, back 70s 80s. busted asses protect workers risk, even hamstrung corporate lobbyists quietly watering authority. common scenario OSHA inspecting massive worksite, finding dozens willful violations exposed workers maimed killed, fining company millions, judge lower fine $50K.

One things OSHA friend loved issue ""Imminent Danger"" citations could adjudicated away. Unfortunately, OSHA fines safely ignored government neutralized OSHA's ability enforce laws.

If anyone wants OSHA intervene, help documenting, enlisting witnesses, taking pics. injured, get copies medical paperwork can, get doctor write something. Take notes every danger workplace, regardless whether affects directly. aware POV future court case, cause corporations know anything serious end up. that's invalid argument. Pandemic status relates spread, NOTHING mortality. poorly written useless piece right wing nonsense. Bad analogy; prioritizing profits end likely prioritize personal interests safety, including health family. employees likely afterthought Curious, human-spread pathogens proven spreadable children? understand would possible. Masks slow spread bit even come close stopping US outmasking lot countries lower per capita case rates even higher per capita death. 


For record, wear mask. Same. don‚Äôt know anyone hasn‚Äôt touched. lost two elderly family members almost family friend‚Äôs child go inflammation syndrome caused. Luckily didn‚Äôt take him. many lost wages,time, experiences worth lives.

We lose 24,000 - 60,000 flu every single year nobody bats eye, point I'm making. COVID killing much more, flu numbers definitely insignificant.  Yeah got tested doctors office took 8 days get results, unacceptable. option go private lab pay $125 would get results 24 hours. know anyone would issue professional sports teams going route impact public tests. No, Jorge, we've though this, that's meats deli section. looks cute tho say SARS like illness, exactly have? sounds like walking case study infected SARS virus twice. documented? Trump cant even spell science. people see social distancing white age.  already wear masks shut down. going see generation people lung scarring.

I'd like also point attempted undermine experience detailed two stylists. Yet addressed either, made assumptions one stylist infecting ignored amount time two spent together,

This makes pretty clear goal solid information. goal finding things back anti-mask assessment (ignoring different virus, ignoring aspects mask use link) seeking undermine information runs counter stance. Even information coming source.

I expect change mind see dishonest person are. anyone else unfortunate enough read posts. There's also ton political pressure get faster. vaccine development testing timeline reason. actually comes faster expected, sure it'd warrant closer look shortcuts taken. like scheduled driven development production, delays tend made back end (i.e. testing). vaccine, consequences bad product could severe, course. I'm saying impossible, makes sense people wary investigate risks, especially end ""fast tracked"" version. clear, I'm generally pro vaccination. Meanwhile, worthless governor (Kim Reynolds Iowa) mandated K-12 schools in-person least 50% time.... despite fact biggest school districts state announced plans weeks ago. Teachers absolutely pissed (and seems many parents too).

It genuinely seems like Republicans trying kill people. Meds changed life. love sometimes literally need able adult. nuerotypical world there. Yeah, relieved.

My wife groaning PITA teaching year, relieved, too. rather WH next....can't wait... caved Musk... it‚Äôs time pay price *think* February, either H1N1.

New Zealand Australia close producing vaccine. many others. receive nationwide free all. I'm certain share knowledge country know unite common threats. never understand selfish people aren‚Äôt worried health. Wearing mask protection well. going get much worse. reasons why:

1. Hospitals overrun... Unavailable medical care
2. Supplies run low important drugs
3. Extended wait times emergency services, people die home waiting ambulances like happened new York nation wide.
4. Diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, increased risk serious illness death covid-19, guess country leads world conditions, United States. 40 something's significant obesity ( almost 50% Americans 40 59) instead .5% chance dying 6 15%. Especially delayed limited medical care. also sucks probably kick sick 70 year old ICU bed better chance survival.
5. Everyone thinks someone else. real percentage Americans met family ( household) friends without wearing mask last month? casual observations circle greater 75%. Yes big protests restaurant bar openings bad, fact many people stopped social distancing personal lives continue spread. rural areas bad shape. Early county 20k half amount cases Polk County (500+k). go Des Moines see like 80-90% masks.

So background yet still reject CDC guidelines. quote loose fitting surgical masks mention things like N95 masks **even cloth masks we're talking people typically lower-income settings, likely reusable cloth masks used rather disposable medical masks cost availability (38). still uncertainties practice face mask use, wear mask long used for. theory, transmission reduced infected members contacts wear masks, compliance uninfected close contacts could problem (12,34). Proper use face masks essential improper use might increase risk transmission (39). Thus, education proper use disposal used face masks, including hand hygiene, also needed.

Fast forward mid June, classes start turn up. different Texas county figures Abbot didn‚Äôt say anything businesses. multiple counties start implementing mask mandates/citations business regard employees patrons. Abbot congratulates counties ‚Äúsolving riddle‚Äù regard loophole. 

Fast forward right Fourth July weekend. Texas cases, % positive, deaths start turn exponential scale. Abbot issues new order, reversing opening bars restaurants different degrees. Also adds state wide mask mandate says individuals fined. 

Move forward another week (about week ago). Abbot says get control learn execute proper mask use. berates young people main cause spread (valid, fuck Abbot.. opened bars... think would happen.) Also plays blame game local governments responsible managing local communities. communities that‚Äôs anted mask mandates individuals since back late April.... 

Fuck Abbot. may fair share idiots Texas, you‚Äôre ass leading lemmings edge cliff. local governments. Mask use simplest easiest measure enforce would bolster health wealth (aka economy).

The article slyly suggesting 128 deaths occurred one day without saying Jail? mean COVID-19 focus group?

Hmm, like way think. wait schools reopen thought triple secret Covid lockdown? probably due poor following first infected people. first cases Catalunya Arag√≥n around time. Arag√≥n followed cases closely isolated anyone contact them, Catalonia started already dozens positives, late. they're starting get control Arag√≥n many regions, following first cases obviously perfect, really helps. guess Italy better job Honest question, nurse... point bag say signed first wave second wave. nope. me, well manage online work/education really depends set up. situation things large chunks work pace (which, fair, usually means things once, usually near deadline) I'm okay, bunch busy work, ton small deadlines keep task logs, etc, really, really struggle. think schools excellent intentions intentions mean success. purely anecdotal, kid's school wash hands arrive lunch. Also, obviously, bathroom time. industrial sized hand sanitizer every room. PTA provides many clorox wipes cleaning products need (when things readily available). stop constant colds, stomach virus, hand foot mouth, Flu run class matter months. No, Patrick!

The source saw fivethirtyeight says 68% employed *could eligible* *up to* 138% previous employment payments. wording garbage ""could eligible for."" mean get it. got normal employment, could anywhere 101% 138%.

I used California that's luve I'm familiar it. Regarding cost living, unemployment insurance system accounts that; generally paying less lower cost living areas, places like Massachusetts going direction more.

Regardless, idea many people actually taking home getting before, seen numbers reported that. I'm sure are.

So let's math. I'll use California I'm familiar numbers. Max benefit $1050/wk, I'll call $4200/mo order monthly math. someone making 138% normal pay enhanced unemployment getting max, normal pay would $4200/1.38 = $3043/mo.

So per month, could save $1156 (that generous, assumption pay full health insurance used get employer). 3 months enhanced unemployment time period, could save, best, 3*$1156 = $3468. basically one month normal pay becoming unemployed. given huge number people already lived paycheck-to-paycheck, much left over.

One month best savings able float expenses. big money going around unemployed lived long time. mean, know there's really dumb people serve. majority they're definitely there, maybe dealt less medic. know lot guy could've dumbest guy platoon dies dumb decision, news report gonna highlight one thing: ""veteran"" I'm sure young people likely wear masks, they're definitely supportive mask mandates.

Texas de Brazil drinks w/ friends isnt worth it. there's few, depends size comfortably conceal purse get one big ones want gravy train federal moolah stop rolling way ya? missed mentioned hospitalised patients already. apologize. still think needs pointing addition written, we're talking statistics serious cases only. M√°s prueba entonces que sirve pa' ni mierda. Bueno, pues. Eso se ve√≠a venir. Pero Trump Bolsonaro insistian. Cows humans millions &amp; millions ancestors also fought pathogens one pathogen DNA never fought before. 

Perhaps expect grow horns, new enemy starts falling us try something actively it. Worldometers, Apple, part CDC? work Redfield you‚Äôre reddit offering data told to?

You make claim. 

But I‚Äôm saying Redfield offered nothing support claim. 

Cases went things opened up. went states opened faster. Mobility data less accurate gauging reactions states restrictions rural areas. instance, Apple Google would shown ‚Äútraveling far home‚Äù early far travel get closest grocery store. San Francisco, would left city limits drove far. Bring yer dead, Trumptrailers collect obesity

It's bug, feature Florida. Pornhub spoken. Welcome MIC Bathroom breaks state issue. OSHA cares bathrooms themselves. aren‚Äôt CDC FDA. 2020 feels like groundhog day... Oh God. rich control things profit ups downs. Costco, Apple, Starbucks, Best Buy, Verizon, Dollar Tree, Family Dollar

EDIT: Also, Kohl's, Panera Bread, Sam's Club, Publix They're saying advanced, places advanced faster we're #1 Murica anymore. Post WW2 Europe rebuild two major wars inside 50 years. US fought wars waged home turf. Like 3 planes went Alaska's arm islands sticking Pearl Harbor. That's it. Entire swaths London bombed out. Railyards blown, ports destroyed, bridges burned, roads bombed out. took while. fields active landmines still pop France.

America skipped rested laurels. higher crime, lower literacy, average high school college grads less prepared workforce pay worse educations. students see dollars per student spent less effective educations use 50 year old teaching models. infant mother mortality rates highest first world country prenatal care sucks. Routine healthcare exist way elsewhere. math skills lower, rates bilingual education atrocious global economics inability operate globally haunt us shift that.

Sure, legalized sex marriage safer trans thirty years ago. places moved faster. We're falling behind fact outnumber countries oil nukes keeps us power-wise. economy bigger virtue population oil. military industrial complex massive, proportional population overall size.

Bar that? slowly failing. police kill citizens per capita, jail citizens per capita, people leave high school worse educations, adequate healthcare across board let children die childbirth rates double nations oil fields! agree you. See? difficult understant. important. culture approach certainly start Trump. He's smart enough envision something like this, let's face it.

Rather, continuation Grover Norquist doctrine wanting able drown government bathtub. That's paraphrase, pretty damn close.

The systematic dismantling regulatory state provided needed checks balances corporate welfare versus social welfare going decades. said, demonstrably sped Trump. may Russia's useful idiot, he's McConnell's useful idiot well. None ends well.

My husband asked thought would ever able come back damage done 4 years. Given I'm early 50s he's early 60s, answer stark. think see return healthy democracy lifetime, resolve fight return sake son wife children forth on. done, took 200 plus years build easily dismantled 20 years, take exponentially longer put back together. Canadian flexes subtle. Many us miss opportunity demonstrate entitled &amp; irritating sense superiority southern neighbours... self awareness seek therapy. stupidity family. 

Choose one. Let's put economic logistics this:

""The States make largest percentages US GDP want continue giving money states use federal aid yearly basis""

Looked frame, starts make sense. wanna force mask mandate? Fine, sounds like purposely ignoring science *still* asking federal aid purposely ignoring science, *while already relying heavily federal government subsidize already shit economies*. 

I feel people states mandates. state governments suffer consequences shit jobs.

Can't ways. allowed complain ""recommended"" federal mandates, still ask federal aid.  They‚Äôre justifying decision using one logical point completely ignoring another. 

Are children less likely serious reactions covid, near-zero chance death? Yes. information, right screaming get back schools, they‚Äôre immune, they‚Äôll fine!

What ignore - they‚Äôre uneducated easily manipulated - kids still pass parents. It‚Äôs ridiculous. child broken home. Reading article, mother daughter good relationship early teens, changed. assaulted mother multiple times stolen electronics others twice. police called multiple times arguments mother daughter? many times ever argument somebody got hand police called?

Are going say completely innocent ADHD? history causing problems. ‚ÄúI told thin ice told going hold letter, order, probation.‚Äù 

Both mother daughter knew circumstances. terms probation included GPS tether, regular check-ins court caseworker, counseling, phone use school laptop educational purposes only. Grace also required schoolwork. ‚ÄúI hope upholds end bargain,‚Äù Brennan said end hearing.

These difficult terms follow. peddling propaganda. Political people don‚Äôt like facts unless support case We'll look that, offering free mask people show without one one that's actually practical. take time money put fake one much effort put actual mask? wait, mind control? Stupid. evidence immunity (antibodies produced human body) COVID-19 short lived - three months. mention mutated appears reason spike Arizona... know mine manifest way do, know looks much worse yet academically I'm relatively alright.

Respectfully, none things primarily executive function disorders. They're serious, create multitude challenges, executive function disorders specifically make difficult succeed academically without structure. 

You may worse does, overall, likely *in different ways*. suspect would appreciate people challenges telling able do, maybe could offer others courtesy? Literally graduated harvest law. üòí We've really 14 weeks Covid. April 1 propagated enough yet going do. Influenza permanently endemic strains overlap. prorated make somewhat comparable. they're swedes? need study know mask efficient.

It gives idea strategy Sweden. infect kids Ebola... Saw CNN corespondent front restaurant least half full outdoor diners.

I think really quite amusing people far better can't arsed work even though continue issues worse theirs.  better someone's dead, wear something mixed scientific evidence.

You may feel righteous, monster. Literally every day. Every single day, wake up, check news articles see White House Administration (trump, really) fucked up. every single day worse. Free AC though places extensive contact tracing, never found cases kid spread another member family. one case kid contact think 100 people two sick? know catch carry it, typically expect spread it. data suggested might not, don‚Äôt know sure don‚Äôt know why.

Heh. No, within miles. thing think want trust people keys truck door back, never figured would be-- like driven away gotten lock leisure.

Where's Dr. Chase need him? Ontario Alberta number cases per capita

Yes, overall. issue that, *in last days*, Alberta started resurgence COVID-19 cases, Ontario continued reduce numbers. Even though Ontario triple population, almost number reported cases per day last also done per capita testing province.

This still something proud of. Really hoping gets people mobilized defending medical system planned UCP cuts. ally? raped? report great! made available general public people better informed situation communities. officially published? Covid new college Maybe tell people protesting mask protects you. mask protects me. 

These narcissists enjoying benefits everyone else wearing masks, giving society collective lead world cemeteries grave digging Well, let stupid ones kids go back school. month, we'll see many dead kids need trucks hold bodies. so, wrong. like need dead kids, want dead kids.

When opened states could see train coming tracks, anyway. hundreds thousands sick dying. still pointing fingers blaming. Look now. multiply oh many times. dead kids without futures. think California budget relies sales tax revenue. Congrats, one person. claim represent everyone ADHD kay? experiences universal sort like US ship manufacturers WWII saying ""well gosh, we're building yachts paying customers, they're paying customers all."" national emergency, every ounce testing capacity aimed bringing down, necessary testing (healthcare sick people) prioritized rapid processing. Exactly. work retirement home, makes sad seeing ‚Äúretirement home workers don‚Äôt care residents intentionally neglect them‚Äù narratives reality, they‚Äôre understaffed there‚Äôs literally nothing do. time it'll different ...

The protests safe ...

Deja vu stupidity. wear mask I'd like remain young healthy. Restrooms exist operational accessible facility? Work center compliance. OSHA federal; breaks handled state. person needs get touch labor law specialist. dont want to, delicate situation.  Hard tell wont there. Absolutely, headline wrong too. Well that‚Äôs terrifying. 

What horrific fucking summer. It‚Äôs going worsen. It‚Äôs full quote. Kroger Nil understand saying here, generally would agree, right pandemic times lot people seem taking seriously. It‚Äôs time avoid reading news even critique news. It‚Äôs time get pandemic control go back regularly scheduled criticism debate media it‚Äôs agenda. What's consensus her? DeathSentence defenders (ie Republicans) claim unreliable due documented issues past. Personally, even past I'll believe DeathSentence. Give month Ah get it! dead herd animal!! look lens geed stupidity, begins makes sense. 

You also research CDC website come best estimate flu burden year. swear virus ears hear talking shout it. There's mask mandate Texas. Even Abbott see obvious. Mobility studies suggest people reduced activities lockdowns. talks thread. Go check out. I'm doubtful vaccine coming calendar year, even minimally effective would make useful people

Hopefully multiple options across globe find one especially helpful Everything fine, ignore refrigerated trucks. Commarade* build wall make Americans pay it. They're sending best. Walmart, Target, Lowe's, Home Depot, Menards, CVS, Walgreens. Anyone else? 

You love see it. people thinking livelihoods businesses.

üò± players free opt out, quite already have. Meanwhile people Huntington Beach, CA actively fighting masks mask mandates school, cases rising higher LA.

[COVID-19 rising faster O.C. area Los assume graduate students read. Also, best students self-selection. Students struggle go college let alone grad school. selection bias. mention current antibodies studies popping bad news quarantined minimum time doesnt mean can't still contagious become infectious soon leave quarantine. people actually involved conspiracy getting away accusing others part conspiracy. common gas lighting tactic used con artists. slight hand make think enemies everywhere except right front you. target near MI sign front saying ""require"" masks past months. nobody enforce people would enter without mask...  I‚Äôm discussing law.

I‚Äôm discussing big practical social/economic challenges remote education. addressed. disease nuts man...and know certain states get bad rap, live one (arizona) everywhere go see person wearing mask.

Just goes show crazy disease unpredictable. Would nice Florida honest shit cause confused fuck people contributed people thinking conspiracy, Texas.

Now state getting hammered. anyone believes testing insane. Sure. Every time put mask smell 5g. keep sinking new lows foresight take seriously since February, hope come realization much disaster president's response pandemic been. thankful run rail everywhere. think.....when loop back around flu season see difference made....that yeah, places may quick go back way were.

that said, pretty engrained cultural DNA hard completely mutate :)

edit: hate engrained comes spelling mistake. Bigly

/s People can't go back work know whether contagious make tests slower, means folks can't get back work fast. little help economy working people. Twenty percent Sweden's population age 65 versus 15 percent US. ratio 33% older people Sweden US.

Since 90% Covid-attributed deaths age demographic 65 older, math works Sweden's age-adjusted mortality rate US. Maybe terrible thing. would benefit (including US economy) disease eradicated. impact biotech companies‚Äô bottom lines, that‚Äôs also mitigated tax payer dollars receiving. Curious everyone's thoughts going back work. company slated bring everyone back Labor Day. thought working home working, rush everyone back instead waiting out. bring ""culture"" reason everyone office, think take year ""culture"" health. Yup. Herd immunity stupid shit, going complete failure. Right self defence ‚â† right shoot someone following proper guidelines, like telling wear mask. Guns allowed mentally stable only. Even job police needs kind counseling keep loons away firepower.

Politicians part populace one point. Captain bone spurs too. Besides, generally self-aware public elect person lesser two evils. enough people sound mind voted correctly, twitter toddler sitting WH right now.

The problem people choosing wrong person persists throughout world. Even general stupidity nothing unique US. look protests going England(?) right now. people suddenly felt like protesting administration middle pandemic. Also, people enlist defence services forget citizens nation first attendants leaders later. But, history shows that's apparently case.

Politics ugly mess since ancient days. Leaders seldom right people job guiding nation. also remain power long. do, likely get lost power struggle. self entitled bastards give two shits nation people. public sound mind willing trample government needed important.

**TL;DR: keep scary toys death away mentally challenged. Allow people common sense make decisions make vote.** Mildly obese still obese...

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Lol true real question hell US good enough testing infrastructure yet. 5000 Americans perished COVID19 week.

May souls rest peace.

The least do, Americans honour support family members, fellow Americans lost loved one, wearing damn mask.

As symbol respect dead.

As symbol unity. ‚ÄúIm Brian Kemp. I‚Äôm stupid, I‚Äôll sue cities I‚Äôm bootlicking conservative‚Äù Trust me, he's meltdowns time. rational man would. Heaven help gain access data could perhaps _end single biggest problem world right now_.

What pity.

The whole effort open source.

This anti-russian nonsense... Bounty soldiers! stealing vaccine data! wonder nonsense next... game dominos starts half board fire, maybe. flu! They're actually bringing ice limearita daiquiris celebration defeating Covid Isis. Mission Accomplished boys. made like design. made neutral users creator........ hope get thru elect better leader seriously address things like oversight limits executive power. It‚Äôs shocking elected game show host influence things like CDC science based institutions leader like merkle would right opinion all. Yeah. meant flying US Japan, distinctly told wear mask prepared. got back home March quarantined weeks couldn‚Äôt even find masks bought Japan trip stock anywhere. wearing mask doesn‚Äôt mean anything. Isnt freedom fighters want? ""You can't take away freedoms forcing us wear masks"" okay wear masks. get choice of: wear mask feed family, wear mask catch corona starve death. Checkmate hope next actually start ENFORCING it. far literally every time I've walked Wegmans Walmart least one person wearing mask. I'm guessing neither likely succeed convincing point view. Maybe time hug? lol say that, yeah whole...our mentality good. Good, waste lemon starburst. /s used indicate sarcasm. went Lowe‚Äôs day masks made mandatory saw 2 people wearing mask. Even mandatory pretty good compliance least Lowe‚Äôs feel like it‚Äôs easier social distance grocery store. someone aisle want something find empty aisle wait they‚Äôre done. Spill da tea! former doctor probably one them. New Mexico must nervous hell sandwiched Coronazona, Texvid, Mexirona. I‚Äôm going go surge US protests, much people don‚Äôt like said. second this!!  changes nothing!

The administration still redirecting data new source hidden manipulated. CDC get limited subset fit lies nothing.

We *still* seeing brand new phase lies corruption. 


The CDC data become useless **still it.**

&amp;#x200B;

There's reason directed hospitals ***stop*** reporting data CDC. changed, whether CDC willing show permanently incomplete data. HHS ordered keep showing garbage data. 


This still Trump trying hide bodies, disaster, failures. $$$$$$ money come from? According ""official"" count, yup. there's good bit data suggest figure much  easy careless, especially intimate settings friends. someone uneducated enough virus ask wear mask friends positive, would argue someone removes mask point touches touches cards. another sub here, said Johns Hopkins reporting would unaffected... fingers crossed. 343 covid-19 programming related. UBI likely put place $20-40B annually net depending design compared current non-covid-19 related programs. Current total government expenditures levels (federal, provincial/territorial local) $760B typical year. $2.4 Trillion economy (2019) bucks UBI actually pretty easy accommodate. Since economic recovery take least two years, several industrial sectors devastated (hospitality, travel, etc) time, current social protection programs need reworked. rebuttal explained ""listen pinhead, moon get there?"" least somewhere like parking lot... Washington Redzones retailers requiring customers wash hands entering stores? setting washing stations make sure people aren‚Äôt spreading Covid-19? It‚Äôs new ABC‚Äôs song people trying avoiding death! mean, it‚Äôs situation essential workers. Education essential hospital grocery store. don‚Äôt want essential quit.  God forbid simply fund enough testing fight thing right.... Ah well, least Kanye Ruth's Chris got paid! Facebook created maintained engage outrage fed misinformation. neutral platform. Well fun 70s 80s New York coming back strong. Lol, reversed course.

That's news me. Sweden significantly change coronavirus They're relying social distancing testing tracing.

Distancing restrictions Sweden strictest end March, successively loosened since. People also adhering less less restrictions. Testing lagging significantly, last couple weeks testing widespread enough TTI strategy could implemented.

And yet, Sweden's death rate falling linearly since mid-April. claim makes absolutely sense. words Admiral Akbar ""it's trap!"" problem labs listed multiple PHYSICIANS GROUP 
MILLENNIUM LAB SERVICES 
MILLENNIUM PATHOLOGY 
MILLENNIUM PATHOLOGY/MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY 
**MILLENNIUM PHYSICIAN GROUP** 
MILLENNIUM PHYSICIAN GROUP LCC  bolded one results (4,243 negative, 831 positive). others 466 results them, they're positive. Poor guy. absolutely terrifying. hell admitted 104* temperature ?! One second check financials again. still doubts, country can't get asses give fuck fucking pandemic killing 130k+ people infecting tons more. trust country anything anymore. Gonna turn everyone fighting rather govt fucked us, major media spins idiots saying hoax bro.

Though guess certain point people becoming homeless starving cause can't buy food jobs, probably riots. I'd bit surprised see nothing happen. anywhere NY know either never someone lived Bumfucksville, USA, wrong. 100% watch news follow happens. also follow Red party like follow crimson team give shit happens long ""team"" wins. 

That literally know: makes team look bad, can't true. makes team look good, gospel truth anyone saying anything different enemy, traitor, put death. 

A friend mine one point said agree guy's (completely ill-informed opinion) woke car smashed. Here, part **right** party might well swear allegiance Satan. Hell, least Satan wears red football season, though. True true, One day 3d Printed nurses. everyone personalized nurse. Kemp.  Suing cities prevent trying control virus beyond pale. COVID-19 pandemic created public health crisis. SARS-CoV-2 spread individuals pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, asymptomatic infections, re-opening societies control virus spread facilitated robust surveillance, virus testing often central. infection, individuals undergo period incubation viral titers usually low detect, followed exponential growth virus, leading peak viral load infectiousness, ending declining viral levels clearance. Given pattern viral load kinetics, model surveillance effectiveness considering test sensitivities, frequency, sample-to-answer reporting time. results demonstrate effective surveillance, including time first detection outbreak control, depends largely frequency testing speed reporting, marginally improved high test sensitivity. therefore conclude surveillance prioritize accessibility, frequency, sample-to-answer time; analytical limits detection secondary. all. UK vaccine already contracts produce 2billion doses world yep, feel situation too... everybody freaking 3 months ago, people care anymore lets see name them:

Fl, AZ, Texas, Georgia, SC, MS, AL, ~~Tenn~~, ~~Utah~~, Nevada, ~~Montana~~

EDIT: Louisiana, Idaho, Washington State. do'h. must vary location, lot Target stores required since beginning, mid May area kicking around mandate, store particular requiring bit early even. whatever hell think best! I‚Äôm shocked heartbroken witnessing country. friends neighbors pitted one another, government playing power politics lives money. 
I line behind teacher Staples yesterday, least 50 notebooks 30 colored pencil packs, buying supplies! paying asked would like donate 5-10-15$ school supply basket need. Gave teacher staples gift card company work donated basket, thinks ok?! heartbroken, become? Thank teacher, deserve much more. knew eventually protests would blamed.

I see higher percentage protesters wearing masks people supermarket coughing talking produce.

Nasty. Yay fascism ""Hey Dick-nose, tuck in!"" totally 

...except not. 


My state gov states rights blah blah blah petitioned MMJ rec mj. fought tooth nail citing federal law. try look everything different sources kinda take develop realistic picture happened. believe CNN said news recently CDC reporting numbers CNN going hospital report numbers public. said came would go back same. way gave comfort knowing. Correct know correct news station reported that. No, karma idiots pandemic. something never measured, I'd love know actual death disability rate covid19. 
As paramedic treating sick patients past weeks. serious medical issues, unrelated covid, however waiting days, week, even call ambulance they're scared go hospital they're mild moderately ill. Living Tokyo.

Yeah, masks norm quite time. issues shortages (better now, prices jacked up) discomfort (or even risk heatstroke) hot days. Friday biggest day normally, right? True. thought Chinese govt fake numbers. Florida entered game. brought extra lawn chair want get line me. so, bring chips? developed scratch

There others believe, like Inovio restrictions AZ place protect people?

Thoughts prayers. see one troll here... Btw, visited therapist yet? I'm 36. Home since March, everything delivered. Called 60 year old parent indoor dining called acts like good job wearing mask home improvement store. Grandparents going church again. 60+ relative planning visiting Florida next month already told visiting them. 70 year old church coordinator person decided need confirmation ceremony weeks also audacity ask partner volunteer teach elementary religious education year. point feel like people forgot explain we're still home. 5000 Americans perished COVID19 week.

May souls rest peace.

The least do, Americans honour support family members, fellow Americans lost loved one, wearing damn mask.

As symbol respect dead.

As symbol unity. UK, US Canada trying keep Covid vaccine data themselves, say Russia rest world people tested notified false? great. extended family Miami Dade denying severity get killed. run church still operating... think I‚Äôll become doctor.

I‚Äôm gonna open practice next week. 

Idk it‚Äôs something new, I‚Äôll try it! april average 5 degrees Stockholm.

Some photos know happened time?
- People adviced avoid social gatherings see quite impact. Yet governor state (GA) refuses mandate masks. know bad even VOA cant spin positively. People believe Earth flat. We‚Äôre doomed. I'm jealous. required here, masks doors &amp; people still ignore it, wear mask &amp; approached.  Yeah well hospitals continue fill people wont get stay long. may see lot deaths. One reasons Vasa well preserved waters heavily polluted. That‚Äôs something climate undenialist you? deaths take months report tests instant? Can‚Äôt wait 200 page bill that‚Äôs fed ex pallet  Good. mask entry. deserve shop safely. Oh, they'll probably claim crisis actor stupid shit. y‚Äôall can‚Äôt get them. 

And ear loop masks don‚Äôt seal. yes, great catching surface still wide openings.

And again, can‚Äôt get em. surprising. I'm heavily Republican Chicago suburb following guidelines. clear picture many people actually infected NYC pandemic started. likely many people infected NYC numbers show. Now, testing better picture infections occurring.

Add 3-4 weeks initial infection rise Florida start see deaths follow. Fauci‚Äôs wrong, unfortunately. He‚Äôs appealing young old already decided listen. We're lucky people still going church here, proven super effective convincing God keep virus away  Everyone take cover brace yourselves. Fourth July first push, back school going mother super spreader events. Children cannot expected properly wear mask, social distance, put things mouths noses, way adults. going happen, fault. Thank wonderful elected ""leaders"" neighbors take pandemic seriously. last thing us want lock Texas back again,"" said virtual convention.

Hmm sure acting like it, wonder he'd act opposed something hel... defended coronavirus response Texas GOP convention acknowledging widespread discontent among party members. Several Republican officials voiced criticism Abbott‚Äôs statewide mask order. Even end testing negative odds high false negative, complete loss smell taste rarely seen diseases, see separate study reported half people reported complete recovery smell/taste inside month, 40% report parital recovery 10% report recovery. mindful mental health - loss smell taste isolation linked increased risk depression. Take care! Nope. 

They stupid. Fuck let run rampart. keep fucking states. That's sort feel too. Let pieces fall may. 

Hopefully idiots cause many innocents killed goddamed virus. would limit fuckers respect is. they're increasing amount dollars artificially. #1 way produce inflation. would enforced. not. People afraid confront people refuse masks, even sign door required. Ridiculous, state competent emergency management structure necessity. Aflac supplemental. helps pick person's primary plan won't. pay directly policyholder, doctor hospital.

The real travesty need service like Aflac all. sheriffs sure minority sheriffs there. already actively making plans help keep peace here. retail workers trespassing customers, leads physical violence sheriffs respond risk jobs. doesn‚Äôt matter don‚Äôt want property. right ask leave property, comply consequences enforced law enforcement like dress code stealing. house, rules. resulting cases? Maybe, maybe not. It‚Äôs important actually find assume ""you""?  Well said, Major Poopy. thank service death rate LOWER England (which lockdown) Stockholm FEWER deaths Manchester (a similar-sized city England). think like that. Many family units rely parents working full time pay rent, bills, insurance, food, etc. One parent quitting job stay home full time means may able pay bills. family could lose home, health insurance, electricity. could go hungry. act like parents can't stay home take care children lazy. Texas 7 day average 97.

NYC crossed triple digit mark 102 March 26, April 2 7-day average 443.

Their 7 day average March 25 80, March 26 closest could get already midst steep climb. also shutdown place knows? Hoping it‚Äôs bad Texas. Maybe control company. Oh wait board stock market is. Gotcha. You‚Äôre name. Home school. 

But case trend continues, think see districts offer significant remote learning. dam cracked (NY, LA, ATL). president gets bored starts barking next cause de jour, schools probably close down. lose lose situation sure. care? Florida global epicenter COVID-19 deadliest day ever, they‚Äôre celebrating People argue(questionably) protests spread covid. Protests ABSOLUTELY made people go buy guns. guess one would right note Walmart sell common sense. Foreign Policy magazine running weekly Coronavirus podcast bit now.

Bad headline. backlog. 691 new cases today. South gave us Forrest Gump imagine many walking around today surprise guest! Whatever man get religion wild human thing, say god even apart that, can‚Äôt sit science based story forum claim kind god without science based proof cut 9pm EST it‚Äôll soon, California (including Los Angeles) hasnt reported yet. We‚Äôre likely going set new record cases. know are, surprised next 6 weeks change mind. Ha. saw lots Karens saying shop Target instead Walmart. fucking ridiculous guy safer grocery store (though he‚Äôd go one anyway). It‚Äôs outdoors. It‚Äôs people. 

If bar hopping... Yes, thank Ms. Lily. Always helpful informative! Let forever known... someone makes tin foil hat statement retracts next day... pulled ‚Äúwoolery‚Äù. am! maskless people see teens, twenties thirties. And, stop hating elders( coming Millennial here). You‚Äôll old fart one day, too. COVID-19 channeling Kanye West: ‚ÄúImma let finish BUT...‚Äù shoeless

That's normally way fucking thankyouverymuch. Misspelled 'should'. Every dining area mask free area, indoor dining areas doors around stay open time, distanced tables, probably wouldn‚Äôt much worse patio. ‚Äúmask free relaxation‚Äù places seem outdoor dining areas (typically) near food carts / stalls. They‚Äôre labeled someone needs stop reapply sunscreen whatever, also use seating.

Edit add: top concern slow moving indoor rides, mainly omnimovers (Haunted Mansion, Spaceship Earth, Living Seas ride). Air stagnant sections, rides belt filled completely seats times you‚Äôre entering space someone else in, slowly. california might blue one they're young reckless. states old gullible eloquent concise tweet, yeah standard backlog. numbers went roof. 

We prepped since didn‚Äôt know fight this. 

Those two dumb states hand dumb. 

For size population. Texas fucking stupid Arizona. fuck politician‚Äôs. fucking residents stupid. though immune. fucking stupid go history repeats itself. 

Fuck even cuomo said ny peak now. 2-3 months might someone else. Yet knew better hell. made grace. Lay now. seal? That's really matters inhaling.

According articles I‚Äôve read, began person services weeks ago.. many congregants tested positive pastor ‚Äústopped keeping count.‚Äù run office. need scientists office. Grim Reaper? did. terrible idea. got food poisoned. live far away sushi restaurants alas. eat sushi now. doubt it. counting 5500 cases yesterdays headline grabbing total ( +77,000). guys need get better this. Sports twats! Grow up! Now! lot maids slaves too, employers steal passports &amp; they're trapped. agree Trump banning immigration? Florida: worst worst

When 6-7% people given time ignored. close 30% like going riots without extra money top.  like breathing without tube?

that's high list, FYI. 1/2 country chosen ignorant fools. Little plague bringers, cute adorable yeah little plague bringers :) Serfs Like late february early march heard opposite happened today Washington state. Someone forced gun point wear mask lol. Sure, fair said 'misplaced', falls sloppy record keeping, bad accounting, actually losing, spending, etc.

It's still pretty egregious, even straight lost/stolen. Agreed!! recently saw scientist came said EVERYONE wore mask 6 weeks - obviously waaay less long we‚Äôve - would pretty much done then. üò≥Done!! see people without masks drive CRAZY!! everyone followed proper guidance, actually could go back school fall. making problem worse. can‚Äôt even stand level ignorance. chance stop get back normal life. don‚Äôt it? üò©. Smdh. that‚Äôs true, that‚Äôs trying do. includes *antibody* tests feels people get antibody tests people sick couldn‚Äôt get diagnostic test. don‚Äôt trust numbers. 

There‚Äôs someone r/FloridaCoronavirus crunches numbers released state every day. makes sense, think also skews things. started looking positives/all tests. Yeah, it‚Äôs higher number, it‚Äôs better arguing tests included. read username right? definitely fight steal enough get put probation. Ever. 

That normal teenage things. Unfortunately that's pretty much line predictions/models people overwhelmed areas migrate places less cases turn bringing disease them.

The obvious way solve federal response lockdown worse hit states. Unfortunately people running federal government eitherasleep wheel denying widespread coronavirus is. Liberty coronavirus...

But someone, worked paid unemployment insurance every paycheck, gets living wage months people freak fuck out. 

It's amazing well big-money propaganda works. $$$ must flow... Let boycott...  loved walk thru Walmart without seeing Karens. Correct.

I'm ICU nurse worked nothing COVID 19 patients months now.

We've plenty patients swabbed positive, negative, positive throughout stay hospital.

NONE patients shown sort deterioration despite swabbing positive negative. fact experience continued improving. 

The likely explanation patients ""reinfected"" rather tests 100% reliable and/or person swabbing may swabbed properly. kids spread it? Yes. common?
No

Leave message I'll call back (maybe). work court business usual moratoriums. seen huge increase evictions...yet. properties may worth more, taxable assessment frozen proposition decreased property taxes assessing values 1976 value restricted annual increases assessed value inflation factor, exceed 2% per year. prohibits reassessment new base year value except cases (a) change ownership, (b) completion new construction. rules apply equally real estate, residential commercial‚Äîwhether owned individuals corporations. hear ""San Fran property values 50%"" state sees 2% increase tax revenue Nobody science never ever claims something isn‚Äôt significant. You‚Äôd expect ‚Äúa trend towards‚Äù something similar disguise shortcoming. 

In short, 12 % without significance doesn‚Äôt mean shit. employer sends daily report yesterday's cases. Oklahoma 699 cases 7 deaths. rather 12% bragged 5.2%? ¬°Atenci√≥n! ¬°Nuestro plan ha sido descubierto! Texas vs. Florida probably ridiculous question, know contract tracing activities primarily responsible spreading Covid? going store, going tavern, beach? mixed bag? seems now, millions cases, bean collectors DC know activities specifically curtailed. Maybe I'm fantasy land again. I'd gladly pay extra 5 percent tax wall. Especially reading poll said many Americans opposed invading Canada resources. 4 months passed im american, choice wait get vaccine. (im rich athlete, ...or work front lines anything). interesting thing watch.  hope works least 80% people take it, ...or else anti vaxx nation rise (and maybe work out) Good, page then. again, trust ""science""? trust honest quest one scientist really interested finding truth world, but... trust whole scientific system pays them? many times scientific knowledge twisted turned legitimize wrongdoings (say, tobacco companies paid scientists produce papers saying smoking good you)?

If anything good comes it, antivaxxers least help us double check biases open eyes blind spots also have. look closely, wrong are, legitimate questions whole thing. many, some.

Just ideas entertain... Wishing best child. police force every major city major budget cuts, start there. Also, making corporations actually fucking pay taxes?

It silly think enemy. misguided person power change you.  least keeps spit inside mask. guys spent extra money looking way spread spit. Yup. total lunatic. normal part contingency planning hurricanes. Usually hundred ambulances (and staff) staged nearby state large storm incoming. dispatched evacuate large hospital needed. People refuse wear masks forfeit right medical care charged trespassing entering businesses require masks. Wow, really good news. I‚Äôm starting today, hopes reduce diminish symptoms, lasted 4 months. Thank posting this. war science rational thought going on, one casualties. Oh, neither judge social worker. job shelter feed look kids. saw many many social workers come go brief time there, since taught kids make food heard complaints judges expected promised do. ended leaving due conflict new supervisor wanted limit numbers healthy snacks kids could eat day attempt force kids eat snacks had. burn out, simply finished graduate degree got good job. hell wrong people Florida? Nope, idea argument shutting shit came from. yes I'm fine people thinking I'm cruel. Especially I'm hitting fact wanna think feelings.

He simply made choice beings resulted death. presented fact science chose ignore both.

 like many others willfully chose wear mask putting life line many others well. die result stubbornness oh well. Natural selection always done. say I'm struggling now. I'm barely surviving, took final year college years struggling get point. 

My point similarities deficits more. gets support; people like don't. Guess boils that. Yes used democrat. Sad ignorance. !remindme 3 months . Lets see retrospect. dad wearing mask says lot. understand angry stir emotions this, however, wear mask regardless end day apologize words apology carelessly spreading virus going fall deaf ears. worked, thanks. I've once. ...are kidding me? daily average 2 new cases per one million people Germany, vs daily average 170 new cases per one million people United States.

For reference, county daily average 400 new cases per 1 million people. Luckily district opening yet many surrounding districts county are. would Levitt endorse it? also piece candy? like lenders fuck lending. 2008 happened. /s Yes, said fair system. That's literally one cons capitalism. want fairness, that's get socialism.


Are illiterate? Statistically speaking kills few. think estimated death rate 21 year old around .00032%.

There also difference vice enjoy eating point obesity Costco first.

Asian national chain supermarkets like H-mart 99 Ranch required masks mid-March, **a month half** Costco did.

Give credit credit due. Rule what? Look around. Hot garbage far eye see Thinning herd guess. everything control 2020 going get almost friends family, least ones left genuinely lovely people. People realizing OSHA complete joke must get different links then. I‚Äôve never directed there. You‚Äôre completely wrong think sub spreads misinformation Facebook. Punch directly mouth, keep repeating
 Semper Fidelis moment thought ‚Äúoh shit, gonna keep track stores require masks?‚Äù, forgetting wearing mask since March. Isolating made little slow. Gosh miss QuikTrip. frozen coffee drink sounds delicious hot day. 

Sorry hear job felt unsafe. know lot people Kansas ton unnecessary things right now. don‚Äôt understand everything packed! Several friends told I‚Äôm person know taking pandemic seriously. mean, deny fox news embellishment?? Yeah, real truth right there. control fire go back building.

We can't even get idiots wear masks bare minimum, can't school kids like reddit's geniuses. Yeah, OSHA cares fact. someone dies go sue company millions dollars company negotiates pay $4.00, wooden nickel, slap wrist long company promises kill another employee... 
How OSHA supposed protect employees 'rona? precedent follow. Yes, tests use also inaccurate. I‚Äôve read sometimes accuracy rate low 80%. That‚Äôs often multiple tests, still add positive stats people symptoms doctors believe Covid. 92 % isn‚Äôt great, grant you, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worse now, I‚Äôve read. Republicans acting fairness public good. total 71 soldiers 44th Medical Brigade‚Äôs, 16th Hospital Center deployed McAllen, Texas help FEMA pandemic response. three month study see long new car lasts, results indicate cars fall apart three months. means usually last *at least* long. Nice ideology talking there. don‚Äôt know express I‚Äôm feeling adequately right now, I‚Äôm blowing steam 

then say that? 

i'm enemy. i'm trying call real issue said reading news might help. plenty alternatives stay current coronavirus. 

those headlines cause lot anxiety stress people feel. social media regarding headlines makes worse. 

its okay turn too. South Park stopped satirizing Trump soon got elected... Newsom expected close schools CA in-person classes 20 minutes. Fed Gov won‚Äôt protect us, hopefully Governors will. not, people going make tough choices keep safe. Please vote don‚Äôt get discouraged let like minded citizens get discouraged. Texas slowly surely moving toward left, even though it‚Äôs poster child right wing crazies. telling wife yesterday mask thing become physical tell tell sign assholes are.

Before COVID-19, best judge books covers. now, pretty much time see someone wearing mask, feels like pretty safe assumption they‚Äôre assholes. Well millions people infected serious reports reinfections apart handful anecdotal stories. even purely observational point view, seems people acquire immunity infection (which we've known viruses decades) mean, objectively mixed.

I wear one chance works.

But anyone saying conclusive ... lying misinformed. Except UK seems acknowledging mistakes.

Best country..... get covid get fucked healthcare system. year, 2/3rds US adults do.This flu. flu almost never contagious symptoms. stay home sick, avoid sick, take recommended precautions. Sanitizer such.

Do believe wearing mask social distancing flu season would zero positive said that, used similar scale comparisons time Covid. people close, know well enough I'm going touch personal trauma. sensitive.  currently unmitigated public health crisis people denial. consequences tragic clear present danger overrides sensitivity issue, least me. fail mitigate epidemic outcome dire.

Wow, I'm actually surprised also done flu, first person I've met understand severity flu. know severity flu, using comparison? feel Vietnam war 9/11 better comparison? flu (in single year) killed combined!! ‚ÄúMan unwilling take precautions spreading virus others died virus swore protect‚Äù could predicted that? never happened before. Certainly March/April year. lifetime ago. can't learn lessons then. Covfefe-19!!! explains I've heart problem since 7 heart resting 120 rises 170. difficult birth.

I‚Äôm mildly confused statement, skeptical vaccines data support yet understand lose started talking statistics efficacy. point making here? I‚Äôm trying snarky genuinely want understand point miss wheelhouse knowledge Yup! Lol gotta fight right  WHOOOOSHHHH Canuck - There's good 70-80% wearing masks city. Infact council told city creating bylaw mask wearing (requiring inside businesses gatherings). numbers mean technically try reopen, meant leash fallout future outbreaks.

For region I'd say we're definitely mask wearers. Guatemala, live, started Q150,000 fine (about $20,000 US). know fine still high, one dared find üòâ knucklehead aunt refused follow precautions whatsoever tested positive today Georgia üôÉ went visit 95 yr old grandmother last week. Covid doesnt finish aunt might. !remindmebot 3 months sure everything please orange hair master earn pet back. mistake thinking finding mutually exclusive contradictory.

If 3 study's find spreads 6 feet 18 feet 40 feet actually read studies find different results. likely dealing entirely different conditions would explain difference.

The take away maintain minimum distance 6 feet, potentially given certain conditions. takeaway ""ha scientists know anything can't agree I'll whatever want."" lets implicit biases get way research. like detective called murder scene looks like robbery gone wrong. detective know actual robbery - screen cut inside, weapon knife kitchen, jewelry missing victim's wallet still loaded, victim spurred ex-lover. detective assumes robbery house shit everywhere focuses solely hypothesis, pigeonholes investigation misses real killer, ex-lover gets away murder detective could see wanted see.

Having PhD make anyone genius. makes expert specific field fields. good scientist lot aware internal external biases ensuring screw data, well realizing flaws limitations study, improving next time collaborating others research peer review. Others see mistakes may unable see attached pet theories. Told ya suggesting trump invade ally normal teen stuff, poor kid. Deal lmao point, way US mathematically avoid 58k deaths August either taking action reduce number cases getting death rate down. Given already hit many deaths month, see alarmist all. heard many friends know certain press secretary Trump would close ideal match.

Perfect nic out. Antibodies disappeared 3.5 months. Depends Calgary people associate with. I've seen ways here. Couple days ago Sobeys saw staff 90% people wearing mask. buddy told superstore northhills opposite time day. 

I seen heard antimaskers area all. However heard others say see time Facebook undoubtedly among us. deleted FB months ago I'm exposed trash recommend everyone else stop giving voice. 

Either way mask bylaw can't come soon enough. Sounds like council meeting monday discuss hopefully becomes official soon after."
