0,2021-07-15," 32-66  live here. correct. Visit San Diego. People nicer weather better.  one put proper context ever accused conspiracy theorist.

I never said think matters all.

It’s extremely unlikely escaped lab. Lol literally requirement children go public school even work LA's winter surge infection though. masks work covid mostly spread house hold private gathering masks required. fuck get vaccine we're going start introducing lockdown measures again. Thank you! helping country possibly even saving life. Good job! What? no, everyone get driver's license drive, regardless safe driver are. like mask mandate everyone. still seems like mystery. author pick sea lions represent kind arguer? Hah! sure come pocket sized version I'll see do. ;) 

To play devil's advocate bit - part reason hesitation propose boosters messaging CDC wants give vaccines highly effective provide sustained protection. logic people likely take highly effective vaccine one viewed low efficacy - one require multiple true-ups effective. one reasons people (relatively speaking) take flu vaccine. 

I take pragmatic view already essentially hit vaccination ceiling. We're 250K first doses day - within week seeing antibodies ""earned"" old fashioned way (infection) assume 5-6X undercount rate (which reasonable; historically 3-4X unvaccinated less likely test). 

In opinion, way going see cataclysmic shift vaccination rates aggressive incentives (positive negative) get them. US, incentive scheme (stimulus tied vaccination status vaccine passports) highly unlikely occur. best may pick soft employer mandates vaccines fully approved. 

So, short simply exporting vaccines countries need (which, fairness, humanist view - statistical good vaccinating elderly poor countries) - put work. We're wasting hundreds thousands doses every day vials getting 1 2 doses pulled go bad. schools requiring though. get vaccinated child born, antibodies go child. vaccine approved newborns then, ever. mean… isn’t enough? changes COVID major inconvenience small chance death minor inconvenience. pregnant qualify. could send hundreds screenshots people saying they’re still wearing mask prove they’re Republican Bet age restrictions vaccines playing huge part LA locking it’s matter time everywhere else Absolutely lunacy downvotes. say think “did happen”!? think matter anyway? whole point people said “this possible, may happened” labeled conspiracy theorists. absolutely could escaped lab. theory disproven. natural occurrence proven. whole point publicly acknowledged. EU everyone wanted fully vacinated yet. What's wrong mandated vaccines? plenty required attend school things society. FDA approved, certainly require vaccine. way general population cannot trusted make right decision own. billionaire, wanted mess people, would pay pub owners stay closed Ireland 100% vaccinated. Hey, could off-licence too.  don’t wanna live world it’s permanently gonna like last year what’s point? Religion-related not? find hard believe LA county would first find evidence this; delta variant spreading months months months evidence vaccine efficacy variants especially UK Israel. Doesn’t make sense vaccinated people would showing signs long term hurt milder/asymptomatic case COVID 15 months, sufficiently long enough show minimal long term effects even normal cases.
  
I truthfully believe bending public perception err side caution extreme. LA county trying avoid like UK right now, *even though UK hospitalizations deaths hardly risen* supposed happen vaccine.
  
Cases proportionally equate hospitalizations vaccine. LA county insane amount people vaccinated, even natural immunity. precautions simply justified gonna run course. clear since last April that's would happen, people slow accept it.


All keep encouraging vaccinations help mitigate path leaves.


And even worst possible iteration, would never destroy US. never would you’re gonna control ship sailed, many unvaccinated world over. *doubt* red group certainly won't. entire states blue, CA, MI, IL, NJ, NY, WA, probably will.

Really want this. even Israel L.A. avoid returning restrictions despite excellent vaccination progress, know say.  think proactive pessimism solution here. know word ""pessimism"" negative connotation, best choice. definitely end disappointed sooner later; wait?  Unvaccd literally breeding grounds covid variants. answer question ?  would think vaccinated person truly paying attention pandemic, would understand sensible continue wear mask about. Thank you! running miles next week, counterbalance story. understand difference “is possible” “did happen”?

If understand that, reality ever was, possible, extremely unlikely. I'm going live life. I'm going backwards cult country millions.

They get sick die? Oh well. I’m training class new job last week dude vaccinated doesn’t wear mask (we send cards hr sticker) coughing lot. Today coughing insane. Every 5 minutes sounds awful. teacher came told need wear mask. 

Seems damage already done. one coughing last week, today 10 people coughing day (not nearly much him). 

I swear I’m literally sitting middle covid outbreak 40 hours week. Im vaxxed wear mask day everyday I’m still petrified catching virus. 

I’m fucking tired man think best option late now. wish states would’ve lifted mask mandates health measures certain percentage people got vaccinated. got way political it’s old news now. Unfortunately, think bed made covid stay. Hopefully mutates becomes less deadly becomes like common cold. think they'd go back full lockdown. That'd cause much political backlash LA might actually elect side. OK line worked they’re literally nothing else ever heard vaccine? I'm vaccinated stayed inside year. I'm listening mask mandate anymore lock downs anti vax crowd. 

I'm going live. get sick? care kid grown, shoes, I'd keeping home. blame scared. Opening schools vaccines yet, surging variants, half population refusing vaccinations, feds telling us go ahead take masks (this part sends blood pressure boiling) sheer insanity. I'm sorry make choices like this. hope family stay safe. First Israel, LA?

Man, NJ *definitely* going first place outside CA reinstate mandatory masking all. I'm fucked. Based trends Israel something let's two weeks; Israel recently talking going even backwards. light Delta variant, think insane in-person school little ones immunity. least option online families want it. older grandson absolutely terrified little brothers might get sick. protective them. hate see scared like that.  first. worse. controlling mutate it. guy lies every breath takes probably wasn’t best source instill trust. Never going happen US, I'm sorry.

There political willpower so.     said month put back things get control couldn’t that?? Vaccines never going end game, clear beginning COVID going endemic like cold viruses influenzas. 

But way blame something never actually power control. whole heartedly agree you. would retract statement “needing” booster all. personally, would take booster meant protecting fellow citizens. Like said it’s brainer. 

I want little pocket version win arguments lol reallly, really don’t want kid stuck home year shit making real hard. surges happen put kill last year? could also get struck lightning leave house tomorrow. death/hospitalization occurring rate happening vaccinated people, would need mask mandates restrictions. reason vaccination rates need much higher now,  I’m things bad don’t root wtf government says ""No mask indoors"" Dutch people understand ""hug, kiss spit mouths"". always though people sensible country. That’s trial results expected, emergency approval take place. still review data. I'm sorry deal things. kind, thoughtful person. hope joy life. thought Tom Cruise scary set before....  I'm trying pinpoint time history (sometime last decade two) everyone gave enforcing laws public health policies. worked clinical healthcare, required date vaccinations would lost job. \*shrug\* ""We can't make it."" Um, yes can. enforce quarantines Ebola, force people infected TB undergo directly observed therapy (DOT), ticket people wearing seat belts, forbid indoor smoking. can't even make people wear masks. insanity. Right said vaccinated people could go maskless lol. usually presented ""I'm asking questions"" among crazies. way. mental health went shit last 1.5 years. I’m vaccinated. people don’t want get risk getting it, it’s them. lived lives. die way lived. interfère. watch video? bet not. Okay, would *you* recommend? matter what, Anti-Vaxxers winning letting variants destroy US right now.  think would initial drop businesses, people refusing vaccine point either lazy too... lacking information make informed decision. people going well allowed things want do.

So rules enforced across board, id bet see uptick vaccines slow return normal business months. said youd put people risk shot minimum wage again. That's they're trying determine: safe kids?

As parent *is* vaccinated, I'm excited if/when degrees additives safe kids that's clinical trials for. many vaccines kids wait old enough get potential complications younger see risk vaccinating kids young. far studies promising complete.  Dude love vaccines got mine soon could forcing people something injected body doesn’t sit right me. can’t get behind that, much want people get vaccinated.  It’s longer drags, less people comply. least that’s noticed happening here. thing makes people comply less less going back forth. rolling lockdowns actually finally made people break reached record numbers back spring. wish wouldn’t backtrack, that’s trying say. remove masks weren’t ready accept potential surge? wasn’t variant, would winter surge. require masks unvaccinated, per CDC guidelines, actually fucking enforce it?

Because suggestion. There's nothing is, idea whether 100 unmasked people around bar, restaurant, event vaccinated not. Would nice know.

Yes, I'm sure would nice know, perspective. entitled know. idea, problem. can't handle knowing whether people restaurant vaccinated, go restaurant.  mask mandate prevents full lockdown I’m guess ...and arrest source, make conspiracy theory look even legit, because....

Anything contradicts theory becomes part conspiracy. hospitalizations LA county unvaccinated

People misunderstood meant. said admitted vaccinated people *DHS* hospitals. That's 4 hospitals 70 county. still potentially great news, know date, patient admitted **to DHS hospital** fully vaccinated either J&amp;J, Pfizer Moderna vaccine,"" said Dr. Christina Ghaly, director Los Angeles County Department Health Services, said Tuesday.  ""Need to"" ""will"" synonymous, made EXTREMELY clear past year half. impression learning anything NL, chose China, Italy, Spain...

It cannot happen (tm) vaccinated Americans. going massless

No way. attending masses sure. En masse even. tried work using Google news archive search, terrible much luck. People keep attributing Boris gov general, suspect media invention. old folks sadly already passed stupidity TBHl, wether virus, climate change nuclear war always thought get wiped precisely human stupidity wondering: SNHD == ""Southern Nevada Health District"" sucks truly feel many others risk financial ruin time become ill. way.

Despite unfortunate situation vaccines work extremely well. terms vaxx rates Canada far different others, look theories we're boat almost whole world right now; 2 possibilities see spacing shots 2nd shots think recent US/Isr. guess time tell 2nd. Well even UK released data supporting idea longer interval would increase efficacy. might what's playing considering provinces like Ontario Alberta something like 85% cases Delta observing exponential growth. hit 50% fully vaccinated week. dont worry, kids fine.  misunderstanding approval means context. Full approval oriented around efficacy. Safety standards around manufacturing actual drug safety same. 

Think way: vaccines known safer given approval vaccine ever granted full approval given billion people. Traditionally vaccines would approved based clinical trial data sample size comparatively small. would taken longer full approval requires sufficient efficacy data extended Phase 3 trials look at. Basically people two choices.. Infected Vaccinated. “The situation improved dramatically since January, Covid deaths outpaced heart disease cancer country’s top killer, according Bloomberg analysis. Still, month June, coronavirus responsible 337 deaths day. comparison, historic average deaths gunshots, car crashes complications flu add 306 day.” schools 100% person restrictions, zoom much less viable option. personally strong opinion either way topic go school/have school kids AZ fully informed.

Also ages zoom viable also ages get vaccine. can't (under 12), zoom disaster work well. Anyone wants get vaccinated get vaccinated close business hours today. available. 

There honestly reason anything closed. would actually punishing us got vaccinated atm. 

There however problem unvaccinated people could potentially mutate new strain. reason support lining antivaxxers forcing get vaccinated fining $1000 month. processed foods industry pervasive use high fructose corn syrup almost every food product killing thousands people every day die heart disease cancer. killing tiny fraction people Covid. fuckers move state bc can’t stand people california different political beliefs. Us born raised natives came legit reasons like work family cool. Thankfully cases Scotland seem decreasing, whatever reason idk. Even countries high infectivity rates see big issue previous peaks. 22 here, got first dose week they're definitely starting younger age groups now(which seem biggest catalysts case growth) Don’t get wrong, moments intense anxiety Covid still. think I’ve literally traumatized past 16 months so. But, remember breakthrough case usually noticed someone facing harsh symptoms. don’t know anyone vaccinated, come contact virus nothing ever happens keep living. test, nothing feel completely normal likely don’t get infected. Headlines meant clicks. Scary stuff gets clicks. make fearful sometimes need remind good behind vaccines. Y’all, going okay. getting there. virus run options soon become harmlessly endemic. gotta keep telling that. places world also high percentages Delta observing this, confusing what's going Israel. We'll wait data countries see somehow specific region. It’s mostly people talking don’t need vaccines you’ve covid, they’re effective, side effects worse, it’s FDA approved. Israel keeps talking comes studies evidence seen evidence countries showing much still effective delta.    Says guy med degree high paying job spending 2 days row reddit crying masks 😂

You're great character,bro!! thinking we're seeing much efficacy Canada based dosing schedule vs three week interval? sort thing easy China would nice know many cases vaccinated. 93% asymptomatic, seem like big concern. doug ducey fraud idiot since voted Well bunch people worried missing work side effects shot

I wonder many people worried missing work happen work business owners particular political persuasion likely think pandemic hoax would also less likely encourage employees get vaccinated Israel releases data breakthrough cases look last weeks, data looks pretty awful, shows 80-90% infections adults among fully vaccinated. obviously that's randomized population split, could lot confounding variables. fact % cases among vaccinated seems roughly line % total population look good all. would imply very, low efficacy. odds evidence everywhere else, almost unbelievable, really know think. confirm true. Also true fact people know unvaccinated going massless. Always have, always will. US pushed get second shot soon possible. agree, get immunity somehow. someone doesn’t want get vaccinated, way get old fashioned way. Adding restrictions unvaccinated people prolonging inevitable. It’s attitude, it’s country live in. America bad mentality “mUh FrEeDom” letting people whatever want. least mostly killing stupidest stupid. Well know vaccines opposite effect restrict evolutionary antigenic escape, scrap hypothesis.

COVID-19 vaccines dampen genomic diversity SARS-CoV-2: Unvaccinated patients exhibit antigenic mutational purely anecdotal evidence.  protesting UN, White House, Capitol Building, even largest fed govt lobbyist firms. fail see protesting Pfizer HQ NYC helps don’t even 100% full control patents laws/treaties involved TRIPS. I'll send hospital bills you. Yup Well I’m glad graduated last May  Lol What’s death toll Republicans vs. Democrats? weeks maskless freedom nice lasted. Seems like concern variants going make covid safety measures permanent. feel depressed back December. Yep, unless employee asks (because feel pain enforce business policy didn’t create). yeah, patience restrictions empty. Yeah, partially paralyzed, could barely breathe Pfizer vaccine. telling work. pisses off. covid. Suffered it. got Pfizer hospitalized 24 hours later. 

Just admit vaccine work. us going life long repercussions,physical financial, it! angry hell. bankrupt taking vaccine even work! plenty hypothosies. possible spike protein vaccine cause new vulnerabilities blocking innate immune system interacting cells.

What exactly basing also possibility vaccine prevent transmission allows virus evolve resistances vaccine effective replicating within vaccinated hosts unvaccinates hosts.

Vaccines evolve, alive. bacteria. also symbolic code stuff going time writing, prediction future Guardian fuck right off. I'm US citizen living UK. never lockdown back home like inflicted country. 2021 UK far isolating 2020 back America. senior high school last year, went school AZ. slightest bit sick, basically sent home 2 weeks unless got negative COVID test that. wasn’t really issue, everything Google Classroom. 

Im sure decision made, method everything laptops/phones meant wouldn’t behind all. confused, could email zoom teacher. Hell, could zoom class class time watch lecture room home. 

Schools able send home literally exposed COVID-19, would think??? mean, that’s literally endangering peers/teachers 2 weeks temporary online school. get sense othering. Households one “dirty” every household world. 

People grocery store especially assume worst everyone there. There’s lot flawed logic going on. Also, want hold everyone standard? zoomer time wash masks night before, perfect mask usage, vs retail worker cramming sandwich break mask hanging ear? It’s like nobody grades sliding scale. 

Another one gets “well don’t trust they’ve going bars whole time”. it’s really bars last 2 weeks matter, covid-wise? get lost trying navigate logic. hello, know moderna side effects severe? Kids dont need them. Healthy kids absolutely need vaccines.

Healthy kids good imune system, best one ages. 

We data backing claim, barelly children hospitalized dead covid.

Sick kids (cancer) may better vaccine. That's headline... editorialize it. Love links. Reddit losing habit actually including sources commenting facts, props basically sourcing everything said. already extent. beginning, said 97% effective on. another variant breakthrough cases. Chris Paul people contract covid despite strict protocols vaccination, One theory I’ve seen effectiveness could waning , therefore Israel first vaccinate also first waning effect. case , booster help. Though may needed people weakened immune system layperson, headline implies 98% efficacy heavily. remember almost noone Canada shots 3 weeks apart, 6-12 weeks part would majority Based week ago, enough data determine Delta deadly early reports showed ""people infected delta variant 2.61 greater risk hospitalized within 14 days infection compared people infected alpha variant.""    


Source: Australia's report, note chances infection Delta greater younger people previous strains, frequency types responses grows, effects cytokine storms likely require hospitalizations.
  

Source:    


And since young people everywhere likely lowest vaccination rates, makes Delta deadly. Unvaccinated young people longer ""immune"" young healthy would claim original COVID-19 alpha variant.  real headline ""FDA grants priority review Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine; agency official says approval decision expected ***within two months""***. idea OP changed January 2022 even appear article. Yep, Dunning-Kruger effect isn’t stupid people. maybe 3 week gap shots best plan weaker immune systems? Yes.

Effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines variants concern Ontario, Politicians... Thank you! It’s probable Prime Minister talking cases saw data provided article either. everything comes Israel infallible concerning Covid. never going end. many selfish people refusing get vaccinated. Basically term ""avoid like plague"" needs retired, turns people that. dont. Lottery: tax people bad math. Since wanting drug new market approved safe regulating body licensed bad thing. get saying objectively speaking, see excuse. 

Silly analogy, since buy houses without safety inspector check first? see house standing afar, may even look great, safety inspectors necessary, would exist. 

I mean, clearly pushing it. Since per ongoing phase 3 clinical trial meant finish 2023.

Pfizer vaccines still phase 3 clinical trials May meantime 500 one year old babies died diseases articles that.

Kids die covid often win lottery. they’ll see sooner  true half country still unvaccinated, half got really good response virus, kids young people. ones really needed vaccine already it, part. headline dramatically different actual quote of: “We know exactly degree vaccine helps, significantly less,”.

The statement quantified way, data provided, Prime Minister making statement. would wait data, findings fit country capturing; they're ahead curve Delta. think 109 gun deaths per day isn’t bad? I'm fine masks, conversation someone, difficult pick non verbal language. 2% participants got covid 6 month period mean vaccine 98% percent efficacy. first half 2021 total number infections Chile around 948k, roughly 5% total population. Without considering factors, translate 60% efficacy. Please really trust number, mentioned, lot factors ignoring here.

Where article says 98% effective? rural parts county less 50% vaxxed, yet 90% people going unmasked. trust people honest vaccination status, mask indoors. big deal pop mask 10 minutes. Right, point full FDA approval going change much. Authorization kids 12 important milestone full approval  surprise antivax movement came here? wow dumb  worries; easily missed. Ra patients

My wife RA vaccinated (as recommended doctor). first Moderna shot actually appeared flare RA one hands pretty badly. upped medication recently try counter still bothers little couple months later.

And still better decision vaccinated. Thank this.

Antivaxxers point fact kids less likely die, long haul aspect needs said breath.

If dont get vaxxed die covid, sucks fault. kids cant breathe properly due covid long haul ive done everything protrct them, thats criminal. state could potentially protected information Colorado. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Yes safe Covid, however unfortunately safe Covidiots.   still spread it, still get it, end hospital. Vietnamese here, shit happening biggest city right now. People immature celebration last year's victory covid blast April/May. we're paying price. people get vaccinated none (we needed queue pfizer, AZ moderna flat refused use sinovac). vaccine rolling later month still slow imo. 

At least anti-masks anti-vax stupidity here.

Thanks many countries donated us vaccines, mvp. Right. Like could seen coming. /s People still fake vaccine card scheme? Last time heard something like dude selling California bar. They're busy farm horses. Thanks !  /r/averageredditor Punish? self serving take. Public health isn’t you. It’s US. logistics making vaccine passports viable would extremely difficult costly. realistic option. want regular COVID updates report cases vaccinated people cases non-vaccinated people on. Something like this:

Hospitalization: 12 vaccinated patients, 3736 non-vaccinated patients.

Deceased: 0 vaccinated patients, 73 non-vaccinated patients.

Let people decide groups want in. Humans show less redeeming qualities every day. Perhaps it’s time giant asteroid.

Okay cases first time couple months. However said pretty much every single hospitalization/death unvaccinated people. care them?

And say ""well kids 12 can't vaccinated"", think this. Cases continue fluctuate among unvaccinated even kids approved. going bring back rules every time there's increase? I'm tired this. loved ones live put careers hold year-and-a-half started get back it. rules ""lol put piece fabric bus, big deal"", whole careers industries can't happen rules place. unvaccinated people? Let’s hope nobody else gets shot it. Yeah, right. majority last eighteen months, kind innocent naivety sub exit strategy pandemic ""create vaccines, vaccinate everyone, pandemic decisively over"".

What we're seeing play real-time exit real world clean simple. combination significant (and impossibly stubborn) numbers anti-vaxxers + new variants means really conceptually simple, inexorable exit strategy pandemic (at least one involve crashing healthcare system and/or killing fuck ton people). 

This basically proven fact many places seemed cusp defeating pandemic high vaccination rates - Israel, UK, Netherlands - seeing cases explode hospitalizations beginning rise up.

I sincerely believe eventually pandemic burn out, think initial optimism going preordained, definitive shelf life mid-to-late 2021 - unfortunately - backed we're seeing around world. Another round punishing vaccinated people help anti vaccine people “doctor”

By means people think hear doctor. hate say it, told so. focused 448 cases, completely ignored growth rate.

Exponential growth sneaks you. Deaths already begun rise Arkansas. likely get bad winter wave, really sad see pretty significant wave, despite wide open availability vaccines.

And people focusing Arkansas. Look Missouri. Look Florida. Look Nevada. seeing worrying exponential growth rates relatively low vaccination rates. pretty severe anxiety comes panic attacks. absolute worst panic attack life way first shot. Put big girl panties anyway. another major panic attack shortly getting second shot. Rode knowing would soon protected Covid. Please let fear stop you. worth get vaccine! ""Feel fear anyway."" Unvaccinated people aren’t making rules. local LA government ignoring science making nonsense rules. It’s affecting vaccinated much vaccinated.   hospital, never specifically lack bed, I’m indirect consequences. Patients definitely receive good care certainly could (and likely) contributed mortalities (for covid covid patients).
When overwhelmed open emergency unit higher staff nursing ratios appropriate, people pulled non traditional jobs (such anesthesia nurses manage sedation/vents managing vents icu coordination nurse three patients instead normal two). Patients much tenuous transferred floor way earlier normally would order open icu bed, older patients high risk mortality transferred icu, nursing required document much typical way overworked opens door increased chance medical error, patients transferred hospitals don’t typically see patients level acuity. People needed surgeries cancelled open beds covid patients (including things like valve replacements etc). 
Even now, life saving ECMO treatment severe covid cases offered many people due high demand - state’s hospitals use ecmo created parameters qualify getting way many calls people needed accommodate. would contribute deaths.

Edit - Forgot one: shortage meds non traditional meds used agree. understand masks work fact cannot tolerate one length time. pretty much nothing 15 months that. got vaccinated looking forward getting back living life (albeit slowly) seems mask mandates might reinstated, I'm sick anti-vaxx nonsense want scream. 

These people going drag years longer necessary. pessimist says another main reason would bad business stores essentially block half customers entering due vax passports. stop entering spending money say you’re “doing part” requiring masks? us page includes CDC. They’re even page anyone needing booster shots. We’ll potentially need booster shots continues mutate. Information professionals place it’s confusing. learn live it, need proper guidance without politics. real question is, rates severe outcome mortality compare Alpha **within age cohorts**?

If they're trying compare overall rates among whole population, poor comparison. 

We know effects COVID-19 age stratified. areas hit hard Delta right now, particularly UK, used heavily age-based vaccine campaign reason, left gap vaccinations among teens young adults -- exactly people accounting Delta infectious *always* less likely become severe fatal case.  enforces vax passports?

I Vegas recently. 99% adults wearing masks. (us) fully vaccinated. going take FDA provide full approval EUA Moderna Pfizer vaccines? They’ve immensely effective, side-effects seem minimal vaccinating millions millions Americans. gives? keep saying fear keeps people getting vaccines, good lord, aren’t afraid Covid? Sometimes think whole world lost mind. stronger vaccine? Bruh what? Selfish sad would risk lives 12's tough wear mask. Truly BS people claiming sacrifice others go Lord Flies get vax. Fully vaccinated people? Nothing. say anything taking precautions. see lot callous attitudes towards rest world lucky get three vaccines approved quickly, ample supply said vaccines. lot sweeping statements like ""vaccines available, problem want be,"" that's America-centric statement, help anybody. agree. made point support businesses taking appropriate precautions safety employees customers. I'm aware costs more- that's worth me.

You're wrong though. businesses prioritize profits safety/ethics. health codes needed implemented restaurants.  know ""doing well"" part referencing? 14-day average 111% today compared two weeks ago (according NY Times). There's literally credible definition ""doing well"" fits situation. employers also want lose staff rehire. expensive difficult. low level paying jobs, already hard find people. think weighs well. I'm afraid bad news rest America  hate Los Angeles.

I live Los Angeles. going stop spread since bars, clubs restaurants still open. Netherlands showed much spread occur one crowded club. Mask mandates useless unless restricting acitivities compatible masking. 

They said restrictions table see goes. expect restrictions would incredibly unpopular seems route going. Hope start voting elected officials support this. Get power. visting California would one reason that's San Diego. Go catch ballgame Petco park, really good time. **"" wear mask pandemic CDC says go maskless get shot, guess get shot instead acting like I'm vaccinated like past year anyway !!!"" /s** don’t unless 1b 1a   Even everywhere people enforced vaccinated entry people would go doc fake cards stay home exile care. real. entire family fully vaccinated Pfizer/Moderna still wear masks go out. People gross af uncommon see people coughing/sneezing open air, washing hands, etc. gotten sick since started wearing masks.

Since vaccination I've stepped using KF80 respirators, used N95 KF95 respirators exclusively. Granted super intensive, would also exercise too. occasionally would need stop take break, would times I'm really pushing dripping sweat. really big deal understand people mask mandates, whether they're anti-maskers vaccinated people ""did part I'm going back wearing masks."" exercise masks, wear one grocery store.  everyone distanced learning. worry much everyone done part neighbor's sake. anti-vaxxers one else. LA already Porn. Seems like either forgot 'safety others' part words got shot good worries. Lots people including kids cant get shot. Wish Reddit echo chamber safety others months ago didnt suddenly show true colors go ""well vax'd good screw rest' large percentage Americans believe vaccine ""mark beast"" foretold book Revelation

How people survive? Like manage put pants jobs incredibly stupid. don’t give two fucks. Pretending it’s avoidable new strains constantly happening fool hardy. vaccinated supposed protected right? worry? Let unvaccinated worry choices right?

Ohhhh yeah new strains keep mutating faster rates meaning vaccines aren’t effective previously thought?

The side effects starting show vaccines too?   California QR code based digital vaccine passports. need businesses check them. hope LA county gets massive backlash several people get recalled this. Newsom needs step risk getting people join recall effort.    many copium downvotes lol Lets face it, masks going ineffective delta varant. social distancing business shutdowns soon follow. 

All people right thing going punished anti vax assholes ever right thing. We're told enforce many people want fight. Hardly problem according China

China never lies, right? ""Uh, yes. name Vince Adultman. work business factory. I'd like one vaccine, please."" vaccinated people definitely spreading it. Here's good chain transmission regarding individual infected 80 others:

""According Times Israel, young man distributed virus party vaccinated. He, turn, infected relative also vaccinated, relative infected person also vaccinated recently London."" Destabilize countries, peddle vaccine world’s savior. Today tested positive. Kind surreal finally covid 18 months living anticipation ‘what-ifs’. Needless say sucks - head killing me, biting cough. suppose I’m lucky - could lot worse real?  🤢🤮  surprising thing long took obvious fakery pointed out. 

This like Wakefield shit again.  pleasure talking someone like recently. claimed covid cases cold mistreated purpose. numbers cold way year. asked would jump directly conclusion obvious option people wearing masks social distancing working intended. informed conspiracy theory obviously right inform much money hospitals making covid. understand alleged anti inflammatory aspect makes people believe anti viral. idea even actually anti inflammatory *apparently*, major issues covid due inflammation people suckered it. 

Same thing vitamin supplements, arent going really anything start taking time get sick. pump HUGE amounts critical patients understand correctly whole world.

Definitely seems like it. Thanks  lot states US dropped restrictions months now? family North Carolina think restrictions dropped May. (Not saying is/was best strategy) completely agree going painful lesson al us... government careless. opened clubs bars told people fine go directly receiving vaccine. young people one shot, none. Hardly anyone fully vaccinated. want excuses misbehave. Keep good fight. like people forgot incubation period  also hurts us comments like basis reality helps perpetuate misinformation. could’ve easily googled answer commenting didn’t asking apology someone didn’t even think did. massive downvotes get saying variants worry US tunnel yet.

An echo chamber copium.  hope ignore go away. people masks vaccines really bad, frankly even lot people say they're vaccinated following precautions also pretty bad they're willfully ignoring stuff. countries may all. UK seems wavering cost benefit analysis vaccinating children. I'd prefer option school age kid, I'm sure we're going get it. trust regulators make really bad decision, gets approved US UK suggests analysis super definitive either way. Climate change much bigger problem Covid though. trying derail here, wish people aware fucked time make changes NOW! No, simple google search would’ve told that.

my post above, sure comment sarcasm :P Yes, type came CDC fauci fuckin joke. CNN “medical expert” tells CNN host opinion something dramatic. make news article CNN… that’s news worthy even relevant. Seriously, wake folks… People can't even take 7 day course antibiotics properly think people going properly dose drug use treat worms life pandemic possibly life? doctors mentioned touting drug replacement vaccines.  Right, let's completely ignore kids people otherwise can't get vaccinated/have weaker responses. know, cliche ""You nice eyes"" probably never said earnestly :) Yep, counter anecdotes everyone know vaccinated caught covid barely cough. Chinese company also investor German company Biontec. would say much Chinese ""Pfizer"" vaccine american. ways stop spread virus, like either physically sort shot would prevent it. 

*Patriot coughing intensifies* Yet highly sought COVID treatment India. Misinformation scary rampant. Experts: \*comes foolproof plan stop spread Covid*

Thankfully knowledge tools generally take care that's choice.  hard mandate enforce private businesses. Hang there. vaccine hits everyone differently. second shot felt like got ran truck lol original comment said everyone isolating even vaccinated. didn’t say sick. sub borders anti-vax. read article said ‘a small number’ people contracted covid. sounds like non news considering know vaccines 100% effective.   people eager believe now? avoid cold war? 

How people war avoid it? pandemic, would say Scott one level headed TV experts. advice/predictions pretty spot on. acknowledges reality human behavior predictions without fear mongering, also gets COVID real thing. Honestly probably should’ve charge pandemic messaging. point missing fits textbook definition conspiracy theory. saying labeled conspiracy thus, real. He's saying cover-up level literal conspiracy. People conspire together make work.

It conspiracy theory completely possible. mutually exclusive terms. flu also cause myriad long term illnesses. Lockdown?

On federal level, far, unlikely.

Besides, number discovered cases per se especially important. affects government's decisions regarding restrictions rate hospitalizations, hospital bed availability.  fully vax'd since May stopped wearing mask June except Dr. Offices places require them. Still keep couple masks car case see wearing one unless place I'm going requires People mostly lock protect friends family 

You really think they're going people think covid fake. may best intentions, subculture special kind asshats called Doomsayers get kicks telling people world ending, wait, it’ll get worse, blah, blah, blah.

The problem is, they’re half wrong scenario. reasonable poster going sound little like doomsayer whole pandemic thing straight all-time fantasy playbook. Study looking fully vaccinated, 2 doses 14 days. 

The fact looked one dose well makes study ignore. doubt effectiveness vaccines. sad despite lot people vaccinated high reproduction rate happened. even high compared last year one vaccinated yet. could avoided bit careful. wait 2-3 months longer get rid kinds restrictions vaccination rate would higher population whole better protected. one place everyone always encouraged wear masks think misunderstood me

The headline gives context whether young people hospitalised

We know hospitalised = severe case

We know overwhelming majority young people develop severe symptoms hospitalised

Just reading headline *could* infer young people general contract covid risk long term damage, really case look numbers 


edit: also reference current wave, article - study came COVID complications *up now* among hospitalised

it also muddies waters study referring everyone 65 'young' breakdown. attitude. 

Stop letting anti-vaxxers set terms here. Locked due extensive rule breaking. better. get fucking shot  That’s right, keep bending daddy government. understand concerns time never able prevent idiots racist. Trying ""soften blow"" immediately dismissing completely valid questions origin virus nothing prevent racist reactions said idiots think they're lied anyway, thing settling bit everyone start admitting yes, maybe lab leak valid theory, we've done validating conspiracy crowd they're lied to.  No. Like many, overly exaggerating weight asymptomatic transmissions global spread. concern context always be, driving force pandemic. reproduction rate would maintained 1.0 those.

One last thing, comment getting hospitalized sure thing.... may want go check numbers far typical, actually almost never happens unless old, obese and/or one listed chronic conditions. used excuse xenophobia, remember whole #stopasianhate thing?

No democratic constitution would legitimate this. would actif segregation, place democratic order.

Making vaccine mandatory means lot things harder, like access school. harder, doesnt mean deny access.Employers also decide whether want take you.

You need understand someone vaccinated mean cannot catch it.
You need high percentage population vaccinated herd immunity starts hampering progress virus probably one least likely breeding grounds Earth new variants emerge.

If anything, opposite true. vaccinations mean older variants struggle spread, selection pressure occurs existing variants.
As result, cases occur population, chances variant bypasses protection vaccine increases. 
It's typical competitive evolutionary process. drivers

I agree this, nothing else. despise drunk drivers anything else world. Studies show NYC subways way cleaner people imagine. probably issue issues show 12 hours. enough contact tracing US know. 

Theoretically said possible. Personally think unlikely, one knows. need masks train, open floor plan offices? Still better vaccine all. yeah, none conventional vaccines seems like they're going cut long run. We'll need mRNA shots. North America flag submissions. Latin America appropriate flag chose  Me? Yes I’m fully vaccinated. course. Note way factors consider dominant variant. E.g. much information right virus disease last year, travel way restricted, treat infected differently, etc.

Thats logic here. don’t mind wearing mask need be, there’s way I’m lock again. Moreover, people aren’t getting vaccine wouldn’t locking down, anyhow. going last year. 

There’s much do. comes point trying take responsibility people won’t responsible becomes impossible. think there.

Though still feel bad can’t vaccinated. already hospitals require vaccine even FDA-approved yet. yes,  agree this.


But also agree flipside, longer goes on... effects continued lockdowns, etc lead economic issues, mental health issues, etc. 


Either way, downsides, gambles issues. point fall lesser issue long term... callous sounds . They're never going lock anything again. going infect everyone susceptible, primarily unvaccinated population also people got vaccinated predisposed getting bad case whatever reason. think take 10 years, probably done fall since people refuse take basic precautions. Yeah, people lost minds bit hospitalisations rising. that's expected. Previously, around 7-8 cases resulted hospitalisation - we're significantly now. course several month high strong restrictions Jan May. something dramatic...like offer FREE vaccines anyone wants one?

I'd probably feel like either kids could get vaccinated.

Additionally, help spread they're not. We're blessed 80% vaccination rates state. Also people travel state state much like someone peeing far end pool, eventually get it.

For me, I'll fell ok lifting restrictions everyone get vaccinated. easy say ""f non vaccinated"", they're also coming hospital resources would otherwise go people. horrible experiences I'm sorry clean mess irresponsible arseholes.

No end sight ridiculous statement. “for people cannot get vaccinated” includes trypanophobic adults myself. grateful this. reside conservative county near LA county i’m wishing lived actual LA county live also go back masks required indoors regardless vaccination status. it’s nerve wracking crowded store unmasked people. feel much safer everyone wearing mask. always wear mine, even outside one really closeby lol zero good. Wearing mask better wearing one. Source, son recommended wear one school docs pre-covid. Wearing masks indoors peak flu season courtesy vulnerable? Sure, could looked possibility. effective small kindness takes hardly effort. 

I'd curious learn bit transmission rates flu masked - everyone need masked get decent protection (like covid), vulnerable person wearing mask offer good enough protection? Could get thinner masks would make easier people like seem hate idea? measures may simpler effective masks? good questions worth looking whenever make covid. 

But remember we're still middle rapidly changing virus - keeps spreading like this, we're likely get variant affects vaxed and/or vulnerable people. Wearing mask absolutely help slow spread ideally help keep us another full blown lock down.

*Even if* flu deadly children covid, still know long term effects covid children. see spike auto immune issues? long term consequences? know yet, I'm ok wearing mask means gambling lives. don’t see people complying time around, though it’s worth mentioning large number people still kept wearing masks, included sake kids can’t get vaccinated. 

LA County densely populated covid running ramped amongst 3.5 million people eligible vaccine taken it, seriously overwhelm hospitals taking away patients need healthcare hospital bed. 

It’s hard feel empathy point dying, especially avoidable, directing empathy may lost overwhelmed unit. end road California. Place done done. 😂😂😂 think it’s little “shocking” bunch people subreddit may LA may states haven’t covid restrictions since may last year lol hope so. purposely switched MS medication hopes get months n actually antibodies. i’m not, plenty people like me. unvaccinated trypanophobia meticulously wear mask never stopped. it’s possible lump unvaccinated people anti vaccine. also possible say unvaccinated people aren’t wearing masks. opt public events, restaurants, super markets. Curbside delivery exists. question might well “why major media outlets, many scientific publications, quick dismiss lab leak ‘conspiracy’ scientific community come consensus, backtracking now?”

Which scientists backtracking? consensus changed? Who's actually saying lab leak likely natural transmission?

Yes, lab leak possible, there's still evidence suggesting case. Meanwhile, factors involved still heavily point natural transmission case. what's difference beyond insisting narrative focused option that's least likely? Really? seems like *incredibly* dumb idea. would better compliance getting taste reopening like?  Fair enough. think LA wanted *zero* cases, think happened thousand cases day rising rapidly. can't live yet, medical infrastructure it.

I write herd immunity vaccination yet, vaccine passports seem like obvious way live it. would help get vaccination rates up, let us keep restrictions place people actually need restricted allowing rest us get lives. really, live outside LA people know still wearing one. Funny states lowest rate vaccination one's actively attacking abortion rights. believe even people get jab, risk delta variant high still infect vaccinated people. think even people got vaccinated, risk delta variant high still infect vaccinated people. anti-vaxxers get covid die, that's them. zero sympathy me. problem fuck everyone else covid keep mutating. Well, folks got vaccinated, might able nice things don’t think third wave coming comment really makes sense article masks reinstated, anything would help third wave getting worse.   don’t think anybody wear mask forever. think haven’t approved vaccine people 12 yet really bad wear mask cannot get vaccinated yet? didn’t guys serious lockdown long ago? like, able buy non essential items stores 1-2 months ago? sounds kinda interesting say know canada late this. censorship, F that. Never accept solution.  never thought reason young people tend vote left tends benefit instead sharing values… fascinating thank perspective access KN95 mask? comfortable they're effective. PM need link funds permit LMK.   ah, Vancouver, sister city San Francisco. much common, among beautiful expensive coastal city tourist rental cars mercilessly broken items stolen soon occupants view parking spot. True. mask even really debated, lot people US really educated.. every single thing feels like attack freedom. frustrating observe especially think first world country. Melbourne looks good stamp quickly. 

Sydney look closer went lockdown. Approx 3 days got it. marked decrease efficacy Pfizer Moderna delta variant. It’s still pretty high, it’s still decrease.   county already said require masks, require students quarantine exposed, offer virtual option. Basically hope youngest kid lucky doesn’t get sick get long COVID. makes feel better, probably entirely useless, even vaccinated people. sucks! pulled statistic ass  right makes perfect sense mask debate ridiculous. It’s much inconvenience. Let’s give best chance end thing soon can.   could done secret Ninja Assasssin. Santa Clara's case numbers look like they're headed direction. bad yet, but... Exactly! lesser two evils kind thing.  Never thought I’d ever read sentence *Delta entered chat*  going worst thing possible vaccination rates, since 'prove' everyone even work. coincidence happened 12 days 4th July. tons 4th July parties, one wearing mask. 

The big wave saw last fall winter happened 2 weeks Halloween.   course lol. natural immunity also seems provide less protection overall vaccine, especially new variants.  before-fore times*  called incentive workplaces likely calculated economic benefit ending pandemic sooner far FAR outweighs upfront incentive get people get shots. incentives like people unwilling get shot end sooner. alas, must give carrot. yes traditional media also incredibly gullible ratings thirsty. sure point is. Yeah, Catalonia going good, getting less cases slowly went 3200 cases weekly 35500 3 weeks. probably starting plateau 47000 cases. According epidemiologist I've read, due fact everyone could get infected 15-29 years due mobility, already got infected. 1 6 people age range infected time. Ok. Undestood.
Totally understandable reconsider career circumstances. would, too.

I wanted clarify many unvaccinated pregnant women. still know now. tin foil messing brain. Africa Asia epidemics various sizes forever top higher levels pollution places. first time rodeo thinking uniforms long covid.     peak hospitalization rate adolescence covid .002 percent. point big enough matter. Holy shit.  First time tests available. lockdown went groceries. coughing weeks, 40 degree fever loss smell taste. second time wife got tested positive. got antibody check spoedtest.nl. result wanted prove infections. Unfortunately negative.

Edit: never got tested. always assumed based circumstances. Guess got lucky? Remember said ""2 weeks stop spread?"" Germany get extra doses beginning, given marginally total us 2% first dose.  must *Macron's ""big stick"" approach*  Good luck getting state right California reinstate it. definite uptick violence miracle would. No. going live like that. slamming anything looking dumb mean really far behind countries like Germany. people wanting get vaccinated really explain lower number first dieses given. maybe focused second doses others? go outside please  Exactly. can’t go years random lockdowns mandates over. Either force everyone get vaccinated somehow, accept COVID another fact life. government really needs chill out. California already something vaccine passport system, voluntary. Also, understand California laws state constitution, goes lot protecting individuals' civil liberties federal law, right? 

Like, federal law, business refuse service someone wearing swastika pro-choice t-shirt probably someone bunch tattoos piercings. That's potentially violation civil rights California. US Constitution, right freedom speech generally extend onto private property, that's right freedom speech California Constitution. 

I think California likely mandate vaccine require private businesses comply vaccine passport system. think many public accommodations open general public going require evidence vaccination exemption. think likely schools private employers might start requiring students employees. Fucking thank you. vaccines target protein binds ACE. mutated, would longer infectious That's valid theory explain fact regions England spiked dropped sync football?

Im sure football impact think dominant impact. Obviously can't prove that. restrictions people restaurant, closures, nothing. 

Isn't expectation things next? Masks public places alone (cause going enforce private gatherings) going reduce cases rest country restrictions. so? Fair enough, sorry assume :) Whilst maybe true, it’s also true hospitalized unvaccinated. infections PCR confirmed? making antibodies very, rare unless you’re immunocompromised. work lab us part study, everyone covid antibodies, didn’t know it. people thought covid back early 2020 testing hard come by, tested negative antibodies. likely explanation never first place. false, vaccinated people still catch spread COVID

I personally know least 2 vaccinated folks caught  doesn’t work like this. antibodies transmitted via breast milk, newborns don’t automatically get antibodies mom. still amazes people forget anthrax attacks 2001, Tokyo sarin attack 1995, Tylenol murders 1982 hundreds incidents years. government. fictional character Alfred Pennyworth said ""Some men want watch world burn."" feel like I'm one people really mind mask much. I'm sort used point. welcome new normal mayor already one way ticket India... given fuck year significantly less likely die virus. know saying true, Canada, pediatric ICUs filled kids COVID past. I'm OP even though son's risk super low, zero, fact anti vaxxers anti maskers willing let kids end ICUs rage inducing.

I’m assuming (and hoping) you’re one them, that’s really terrible thing do.  plenty people choice... e.g., Coronababies born last year

just wear goddamn mask would assault. It’s also interesting appears mutations could also possibly evade immunity previous covid infections, immunologist virologist could definitely mistaken interpretations study. benefit expected get shitting everyone else’s vaccine?  LA went making fun Orange County antimask antimask fast got whiplash sick this. WTF. That's sub spoke week.

But one study whole picture. much feel sentiment, need right now. plenty assholes, yes. bunch want see world burn. lots make selfish choices. fully see that. people too. distrust. bad experiences government. feel anxious. often emotions result someone acting out, pushing away, especially majority thinks otherwise comes strongly think best everyone.

Antagonizing, lack patience, helpful pandemic. need everyone vaccinated, need high coverage. let people take shots. talk people. Mostly ask, instead tell. Ask research. Provide information, preferably emerging backgrounds. time, change opinion. defining trait human. reflect behavior change it. Let's help that.

Ps. I'm fully vaccinated way, strongly believe vaccinating one hopes ever putting genie back bottle speaking virus. Define “a lot kids.”

So far, 334 kids age 18 died covid US. nobody likes people die, don’t think we’re threshold “a lot.” That's kinda information really wish had. Like, immune systems affected constantly interact common bacteria viruses? know covid immunity wanes time; compare waning immunity stuff usually regularly challenge immune systems never notice? We'll probably never know sure, bet cold flu season year going *rough* even without seasonal nature covid also accompanying kinds infections. Thank you! fully vaxxed since April husband still masking people nasty like getting sick ain’t fucking Delta. We’re still living lives, hang gatherings vaxxed friends family, I’m retail job 8 hours day going store, mask up.

Gee, sounds familiar. chances kid seriously ill incredibly  least LA County, mask mandate uptick cases. Yes, everyone wants get vaccinated takes us longer get everyone. We're even buying million doses Romania ran people. I’m one upvoting downvoting. They’re called Variants. Alpha delta variants. We’re seeing variants “simply evade vaccine”. We’re seeing, we’ve seeing almost year, variants show partial evasion reduction vaccine effectiveness. state things matters. wear inside grocery stores, etc. I'm place eat, I'll take off. variant, concerned, stupid ass people refuse vaccinate...sigh  no, get rid /s, like idea taking long? get amount proportion population everyone else EU? Dying negative. There’s tons things don’t know covid long term. would happily wear one around neck. wearing mask  still too, I've def worried times signs say Masked unless vaccinated, always wonder people think I'm antivaxxer now. :/ masks help much. Wearing mask doesn’t completely prevent unvaccinated people spreading it. Weird headline. state government blame slow action lack clarity Lol crazy reactionists sub top. People make huge accommodations pandemic. Mother’s gave birth mask, without husbands. Healthcare workers insane hours put front line. People lost jobs. Businesses went under.

But put mask *sometimes* able basically anything want it’s completely open, that’s back square 0? Wearing mask punishment though, fact people treat like part problem imo. Maybe try lower does, 2mg, see respond.

Like, it'd effective incentive me, I'm already vaccinated so.... people choose vaccinated risk, also elderly people, disabled people children. chose vaccinated, I'm still risk. isn’t, weakens mutates. It’s transmissible less serious symptoms. end game people want admit it. reason wear mask anymore. care think I'm unvaccinated makes uncomfortable, problem. wear masks school year I'm going pretty pissed off. 

You ain't petty bro. People wanna get vaccinated that's problem wanna hear bs people making going mutate kill us all. vaccinated go enjoy life rn. Well, when's last time offered time work, free food even money flu shot? know people often cite cruises environmentally disastrous actually isn’t significantly true type vacation people would visit many places.

Also due new fuel regulations came place last year SOx emissions already ton version previously. time read cruises horrible it’s they’re comparing emissions per person flight versus cruise stupid cruise ships function large mall hotel casino addition travel vessel. They’re also using older pollution data new regulations came place scrubbers put on.

Now obviously eco friendly thing stay home fly world cruise you’re going make type comparison least fairly. happened couple months ago, didn’t feel pertinent delta variant wasn’t raging US yet.  want say same, unfortunately people close either a) hesitant b) busy don’t care enough c) antivax spectrum.

I’ve seen replies thread, you’re one people seeing bullshit here. haven’t visited sub months, it’s truly astonishing reading mindsets people here. don’t know anyone like real life. past 18mo really warped people’s brains. 

Where live, covid isn’t hasn’t problem all. April/May 2021, wouldn’t even known covid thing traveling around town. masks, distancing, restrictions, people happy see one another, etc.  funny actually sound like anti maskers beginning virus. caring can't legitimate reason. instead killing grandma grandpa kill young sick open economy.

Ive always considered essential work never got work home paid leave. still wear mask inside im around people outside. what’s suspect exactly?  clearly worked acute hospital care setting. Every ICU follows regiment exact vitamins. also read peer reviewed data. think asymptomatic infections still validity discussion unless know conclusively zero spread asymptomatic individuals. 2 young kids I’m fully vaccinated. still worry unknowingly bringing home them. Even though kids pretty well it, I’d rather get infected. Makes sense.  I've already people freak expressing pleased LA hoped places would follow. Good. It’s time fucking annihilate anti-vax movement. They’ve enough time grow part social contract.

LA cool laid back Hollywood vision Los Angeles.   Make mandatory. It’s simple. either tough work leader crisis we’re back last year.  Source? No, compounds referring synthetic antibodies based real ones unusually resistant individuals, improved number ways via fancy modifications. Basically, found people whose covid antibody software particularly effective wrote incredibly sophisticated mods (using tools invented primarily publically-funded researchers) improve performance, started selling designer antibodies wealthy. So, scientifically amazing, going exacerbate global vaccine apartheid.  Love idea think that’s much delay effective reward. Give people cash now. Raise premiums later. Use carrot stick. Incognito mode. focused short game mean could see business choses allow unvaccinated business suggesting government force every business enforce this?  wearing mask really big deal? It’s negligible. Sure, annoying wear indoors don’t see something get worked over.

My county way vaccinated LA county still lot people wear masks voluntarily. always carry mine put based specific place I’m going inside requests vibe. don’t mask mandate don’t see huge deal.

There’s also big segment population (0-12y) can’t get vaxxed. time delta variant running rampant. Thinning herd, will. Angry? like hopeless.   Excellent post thank restaurant sitting table 6 ppl. wrong. Dumb move. Also dumb reason waste hundreds millions taxpayer dollars recall.   Yeah sucks time, wearing mask. bad. That’s I’m assuming too. said viral load got hit sicker got. assume would true vaccinated people. virus higher chance getting me.  mean, knowing viruses work, incubation period way low. going start mass-shedding coronavirus less 24 hours first contracting them. safe grandma public, would safe around someone exposed less 24 hours ago.    say, $400 tax break next year getting vaccinated certain time? feel like might incentivize lot idiots finally get it.  I'm still vaccinated still threaten me. Odds mutates less deadly anyway. Sympathy level zero here. right make choices obligation live die consequences. LA pretty good 60% last read certain neighborhoods low vaccination rates, Unfortunately travel easy many Los Angeles county residents (both vaccinated unvaccinated) simply drive neighboring counties (or Las Vegas) spend time unmasked indoors.

Doubt measure helps LA unless mostly Orange county starts mask mandate. Keep mind 63% residents Massachussets fully vaxxed, 29% fully unvaxxed.

Adjusting representation turn percentage sort ""mortality index"":

7/0.63 = 11.11 
93/0.37 = 251

If turn back percentage get 11.11/(251+11.11)=0.042.  
So adjusted representation, actually 4.2%.

I'm statistician hope screw up, even get jist - 100% population vaxxed, 100% cases would necessarily breakthroughs.

Also fragile individuals old way overrepresented vaccinated category compared unvaccinated, even adjusted still 1:1 comparison. Hey safety officer. I'm going report county state live in. report findings directly CDC state level entities. discretion want send information direct counties. I’ve seen reports army told commanders ready get people vaccinated soon it’s FDA approved, probably September. Ok follow rules  Yeah, sucks. I'm 31 start immunosuppressants month different condition previously put high risk. part watching self-centered dolts frustrating follow rules angry  Interesting, suppose makes sense. Guessing vaccines work lot less constantly exposed someone. person must plan wear mask rest life getting vaccine much else prevent it. must correct one. envy apparent belief magical thought energy. think professional sports teams got J&amp;J wanted limit amount time players would vaccine symptoms.  farce  Oh yes. Taking look LA's infections winter, definitely conclude infection controlled.  He's probably Russian bot   best numbers vaccine protection severe cases really good - like 95% effective good. still means 20 unvaccinated people would position, 1 vaccinated person would. infections general, like 4:1.  
 
And see real world. example currently San Francisco Marin counties, hospitalizations covid 9 unvaxxed / 2 vaxxed SF 13 unvaxxed / 2 vaxxed Marin. 
  
 
Those kind numbers expect places high vaccination rates according efficacy percentages. shows vaccines really helpful, severe breakthrough cases super ""rare."" there’s public health mandate that’s issued less 24 hours later, you’re right. 

I care others community.  called “conspiracy theory” media epitome dismissiveness. Yes, nobody expected need one eat restaurant, tons people LA got vaccines elsewhere visiting there. Whenever Americans finally get vaccinated able prove it. feel like less end crisis half time angelino, i'm really happy this.. delta joke. Melbourne end lockdown Sydney. talking LA county, people Trump style Anti-vaxxers. apathetic believe benefits getting worth effort wearing mask help people countries Oh yeah, beyond stupid traveling countries obsessed maximizing safety?
i mind getting booster shoot means travel Vietnam. mean, putting mask unvaccinated people, putting health officials telling to. LA County gives digital vaccine card QR code even hinted virus came laboratory beginning pandemic, labeled worst person earth. Yeah, do.  need add non compliance tax. work charges extra 50 bux year insurance smoke. Vax card owe 50 dollar endangerment tax next year.  us dont care I'm convinced sub filled anti vaxxers making scary stories seed doubt vaccines. I'd take anything posted grain salt.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  total bullshit? seen anywhere else  heard people getting lung scarring mild infections? 
Yes, signs organ damage people even asymptomatic infections, remember, mild symptoms relate immune response infection, i.e. they're necessarily proportional damage occurring inside bodies. damage becomes significant enough, get symptoms too, starts go mild, hospitalisation! 


Given vaccines reduce hospitalisation risk 90-95%, I'd expect similar efficacy form long covid. course there's another type long covid believed rogue antibody generated response covid infection, continues attack bodies long infection cleared. Given vaccinated immune system templates antibodies attack virus, less likely produce new rogue antibody, can't ruled guess. 


In short right. Vaccines make us invincible risks remain, dying, long term issues. imo certainly good general health, risks pretty low another thing world *could* kill you, probably - least new killer variant comes along ;) time. talk weed dealer! never know connections with. put optimistic hat, hope they're figuring practical population vaccination level keep things manageable. world Delta widespread virulent variants, SARS-CoV2 (with widespread vaccination) come resemble common cold coronaviruses, mostly benign, occasionally bolt-from-the-blue severe infection, much like flu. think 2020 everyone needs see data play little bit convince it. sense excited UK reopening we'll get see play real time large scale (much larger Israel).

When take optimistic hat, worry actually plan, never been, likely be. one thing shut something down/take something away (closing border). another thing develop forward looking plan achieves positive result. govt strong track record latter I'm afraid. phenom appeal PM mean strain border closure (business, people inside outside country) felt much longer ought be.

To clear, think govt outstanding (world-beating) job 2020 keeping people safe. Nothing say seen taking away that. also think vaccine rollout slow. We're point NZ's primary supplier (Pfizer) talking getting approval booster US, filled international orders yet. NZ, I'd wondering pressure govt applying Pfizer deliver obligations. Australia rope prior PM help that. worry NZ, culture ""well we'll accept lot question it"" coupled govt's popularity hindered legitimate critical analysis sense urgency.  winter coming actually think everyone agreement this.

The argument starts try determine side presents called ""misinformation"". common reinfectiom? gone 4.5 months total. 3 months taste came back slowly Ok. Seems.like talking 2 different governments.   hospitalizations LA county unvaccinated, really really think new mask mandate going fly.

It's way across country. Rough estimates saying 9/10 cases hospital unvaccinated. Especially Missouri currently, they're getting absolutely ravaged. state *barely* 30% Vax rate, they're paying heavily it.

""I've studied every punch ever thrown. battle. pop quiz best"" - immune system Oh look, back masks even though every vaccinated person smallest amount intelligence never stopped wearing one. love saying told morons. Moderna Pfizer remain highly protective hospitalization death (although still percentage points Delta). 

That said, becoming increasingly clear vaccine efficacy symptoms definitely gone materially versus Delta. combination natural antibody decay time well decreased efficacy antibodies preventing Delta. 

These mutually exclusive outcomes partly governed different immune responses (active antibodies prevent infection, B cells help respond quickly one prevent becoming serious). 

That said, clear boosters would help reduce likelihood experiencing serious (in colloquial term, medical) flu-like illness individuals reduce spread unvaccinated. would boost antibodies back highly infection-protective level reduce spread vaccinated individuals 6+ months. country like US awash vaccines reached vaccine uptake, public health brainer offer least option folks high risk likely going exposed anti-vax hooligans. buy theory, one circulated Delta emerged multiple mutations spike protein.  are, there's government actions cause protests France, transit authorities seem protest nearly yearly wages there, change agricultural policy seems drive farmers dump manure city centers..

Random outdoorsman? Vaccinated

Cow? Vaccinated 

Slow old lady? Vaccinated, many times   organizing protest piece cloth seems stupid. I'd focus getting people vaccinated. Delta ""Doesn't air smell much sweeter without masks?!"" surprise? It’s funny. told again—especially Reddit early on—that people warning exact thing crackpot conspiracy theorists.

Glad gave power state! That's bullshit, gotta go this.  Same, never stopped! one household, even one worked register beginning, much cold. I'm L.A. changes nothing family we've continued mask avoid crowded public places. SHAME anti-vaxxers yet call COWARDS, please?  


THEY'RE CHOOSING KIDS! WTF?  dont things never get shut again. vaccines work reading reddit like reading YT comments section without videos. vaccines work idiots vaccinating ruining everyone. Ultimately unvaccinated either get immunity getting disease getting shots. end distant memory. think fundamental misunderstanding vaccine effectivness measured.

Several ways, earliest ones controlled study, principle investigators would recruit volunteers fit requirements, randomize control test. large enough numbers group, get equal distribution people live mask mandate/no mask mandate, many infected around them, location world, variants etc.

That's pretty good nothing beats real world. plenty people get vaccinated post-market, Doctors study coordinators would gather data monitor vaccinated infected, compare general population. measuring people within population, could start see departure, example older people vaccinated first. variants breakthrough vaccine protection, we're getting latest data, far fairly effective. recently, London study showed Pfizer 88% effective hospitalization due Delta infection. Probably less likelihood threat authorities. downvoted asked downvote. 

CDC made decision. acknowledge risk super low you’ve vaccinated. Let live life. part. moment fine. However, virus spreads, mutates gets chance infect people including vaxxed people.  That's strong pressure find new way infect vaxxed people.

The delta plus (India), epsilon (California), iota, lambda (Peru), etc. there. We've also learned coronaviruses ""combine"" variants take best mutations someone infected 2 strains.    cases UK high? vaccinated people US? Second dose statistics already way higher US. 

I get unvaccinated people mostly ones hospitals tracking many vaccinated getting sick? [Vaccine efficacy, effectiveness protection | 14 July, Europe also mandated indoors health officials never said vaccinated individuals remove them,
but store owners look way, won’t surprised happens considering CDC saying don’t actually need them. depends store guess, I’m sure they’re also tired telling people off. Oh absolutely. 

I said thing - many posts saying “Me too! Fully vaxxed currently writing hospital bed. Delta serious!” 

Meanwhile post history shows posting random forums every minute.

And life go on. common cold 18,000 variants. develop form protection young age, really doesn’t matter. Rampant spread among unvaccinated hurts lit innocent people well, though. Breakthrough cases, children, people can't get vaccinated. Sure fellow man interest protecting themselves. 

It's like constantly pulling someone oncoming traffic barate call cars road lie. certain point I've done do.

I want see people get sick die, also plan wear masks limit social activity get vaccine protects themselves. Useful info. Also, even down, could one justify thousands deaths deaths? goal governments pandemic keep people alive healthy possible mRNA vaccine train immune system recognize virus? thought mRNA vaccine gives instruction generate antibodies target S1 spike protein prevent binding. research mRNA vaccine give B cell immunity?

There endpoint Covid far infectious simply vanish. Israel 80% adults vaccinated, still successfully ping-ponging around finding smaller numbers unvaccinated.  Eventually time it'll get everyone. It’s exactly shot dark suppose transmission reduced vaccinated. know lower viral load, instance, generally corresponds lessened ability transmit; know getting vaccinated significantly reduces viral load even get infected (and remember, many vaccinated people don’t all) — it’s unreasonable inference vaccines reduce transmission way, least.

I guess you’re right we’d need mass asymptomatic testing *know* transmission absolute sense. I’m convinced need *know* absolute sense. points concern diverge. think you’re needlessly fixated detectable presence COVID population, vaccinated not. I’m focused severe outcomes like hospitalization especially death. concern asymptomatic mildly symptomatic vaccinated people spreading virus vaccinated people, almost certainly develop similarly and/or mild symptoms, get infected all? don’t get we’re concerned here. inevitability knew would happen beginning. Even transmission wasn’t reduced vaccines all, reduction severity still real extremely effective. guess transmission question important you’re trying reach unattainable goal zero almost zero COVID spread; what’s far likely people get vaccinated, vaccinated people get infected, infections mild. That’s real goal vaccines — get number cases zero, close zero. repost; imagine atmosphere lots fun. many home countries ever make finals. Many hospitals also require flu shots, date tetanus shots etc. etc.

Your job ask/ensure vaccinated legally can't cases unless job puts others specific risks.

There’s reason dirt uncleanliness induces automatic revulsion response. biologically adapted avoiding disease vectors possible. public shaming highly effective way motivate socially responsible behavior community. Minnesota, state requiring online option anyone wants it.  Idk pretty close me. It’s negligible piece cloth. 

I everything could pre pandemic. put extra piece clothing sometimes public. life pretty much back normal.

That's better remdesivir, it? Suicides flat slightly spring/summer last year. even  Covid killed 630,000 Americans little one year.

The last time flu anywhere near deadly hundred years ago. BaBIES KiLLED Abortion? /S Lets say covid 5% chance putting hospital.

And lets say vaccine 95% effective stopping hospitalization

(I semi made %'s math reasons)

Is correct way look this? 

400 unvaccinated people = 20 people hospital

400 vaccinated people = 1 person hospital. (400 * 5% * 5%)


And death side, say 1% chance death 95% effectiveness vaccine

2000 unvaccinated people = 20 dead

2000 vaccinated people = 1 dead (2000* 1% *5%)


And course ~10% chance catching covid first place didn’t want real conversation want people give permission feel guilty masking despite evidence should. actually UK? England's reopening phased lifting last restrictions. Nothing delta new radical. circulating around global population since October last year. Meanwhile anyone currently vaccinated appears strong protection every known variant.

The vaccines working working well we're seeing unvaccinated representing 95% newly hospitalized COVID-19 cases. Vaccines may protect asymptomatic infection mild cold strong preventative effect severe disease. rather pedantic point, one might generally expect higher standards BBC:

Agree long hospitalizations deaths don’t rise significantly well don’t think there’s anything else really would “acceptable” end game suppose. hard time figuring wanted word last sentence hope message came across right least. Don’t forget “we’ve suffered enough already, live lives” Vaccinated people less likely show symptoms therefore less likely get tested,

Sounds like something pulled ass. data back up? even os true, doubt would make significant difference rates since death rate low vaccinated vaccinated. likely result severe case covid aka hospitalization and/or death, increasing vaxxed death rate disproportionately

That depends date rate talking about. would increase CFR IFR.  I’m second category, it’s beyond infuriating sad.  masking vaccinated individuals protect vaccinated unvaccinated? We're 30k deaths away Covid killing Americans deadliest flu history 1917-1921.

Sadly, feeling won’t last enjoyed watching England lose finals. Says guy thinks masks oppressive 😂

Should stop wearing pants public show gigantic balls,doc!! Good know. However, answer question.

Why invest new technology?

Are vaccines mentioned effective Pfizer/Moderna ones? dates those? first I'm hearing it. Article appears imply decision could come much earlier -- four five weeks.  headline seems misleading here. agree using FDA approval excuse, make difference.  employee mandates may another thing. excited COVID vaccines get FDA approval!   I’m dude internet idk lol legit matter anymore, reason.

Anyone wanted vaccine could've one now. want roll dice life, I'll hardly feel sorry die. I've taken first antidepressant three years without medication. feel defeated Yes do. That's efficacy is. final covid restrictions removed days England last weekend hosted major parts one big international football tournaments. 

And England made final, atmosphere London electric, really felt like unofficial ‘covid party’ really fantastic, sea people singing, drunk, happy , high, cheering (and course went overboard!) Pubs park packed be. Many should.

Sadly England lost final shootout we’ll always memories glorious day. 
And week 28°C sun. It’s BBQs beer gardens around waiting big events open Monday. 

To say people jubilant understatement, anticipation next week palpable. Bring festivals, music fun. found introduction section paper appeared almost entirely appeared authors run entire paragraphs press releases websites ivermectin Covid-19 thesaurus change key words. “Humorously, led changing ‘severe acute respiratory syndrome’ ‘extreme intense respiratory syndrome’ one occasion,” Lawrence said.

It's almost comical awful study was. totally completely fraudulent...unfortunately, anyone knows anything academic integrity Egypt surprised this. I'm guest reviewer journal gets lot submissions Egypt shear misconduct (plagiarism, questionable calculations, hilarious statistical errors) mind boggling.

Anyway, quiet ivermectin zealots there. moored facts reality. them, ivermectin religion, much like HCQ, least HCQ, Trump stopped talking it, suddenly decided effective. going happen. pipe dream March 2020. We've eradicated like two viruses human history, took decades accomplish.

Again, slightly misunderstood. virtually eradicated lots viruses. example, H1N1 hardly traceable anymore, rubella, smallpox virtually extinct. Sure, might still three-digit cases per year (except smallpox think exists all) **not able cause pandemics**. unsure impact long covid *in children* justification national lockdown. order even prevent kids getting covid shut schools maybe another year. That's lunacy. Makes sense, since kid coming covid require school shut disinfected. School staff required vaccination well condition employment. yet still seeing studies showing effective. Prime Minister speaking? match read sources all. course they'd love yearly dose lol He's CEO job look companies future, I'll wait official studies come out.   Canada right thing do, world facing vaccine shortage likely last long time? Vaccinating entire world seems protects everyone, even need boosters. Praise Lord.  Yeah maybe right. Also consider vulnerable groups vaccination rates (hopefully) higher. Let’s hope best! best guess methotrexate. American College Rheumatology recommends stopping medication getting covid vaccines. put recommendations specific medications too. Well, nice knowing all. NDT lives ass gets high farts.

I'm sure that's way Carl Sagan would approached educating public. twitter rant. Tbh I'm worried long covid children. long covid adults too. many damaging unknowns allow novel virus run population. 

Plus actually necessarily another lockdown. mismanagement contact tracing gotten us here.  # people want vaccine can't get reason (and eligible vaccines readily available them) divided number people want vaccine

Got like 1% Don’t worry. know chose covid.

Meanwhile, I’m sitting waiting 2nd vaccination. personally think would side people saying shouldn’t required vaccinate.

Haha no. employment means employers allowed fire people pretty much reason, including like hairstyle day.  little effort... carrying mask around still second nature even wear one months...

Putting big deal, especially 15min subway ride whatever. Can't agree more. existence pandemic subjective, either pandemic isn't. Maybe system medical community input information patients cannot vaxxed medical reasons, anyone gets covid *chose* give vaccinated gets booted hospital need beds emergencies... 

If unvaccinated people start overwhelming medical system ones medical issue preventing simply refused get first ones kicked children, immunocompromised, heart attacks, car crashes, bed... nearby city got new public schools a/c back 2009. small town live a/c schools rarely gets turned on. town county live turning a/c find why. Like fund push creation multiple vaccines mass production record speed - literally miracle science? Oh see.   basically stacking deck analysis.  vaccinated people (\~15% data) half 50. unvaccinated, (\~85% data) 98% 50. people 50 die higher rate.  compared two groups far equal representation.

What saw vaccines made less likely hospital less likely move serious complications 50. (vaccinated) coworker diagnosed Delta variant morning, entire office freaking out… I'm sure follow? Also post main thread, response someone saying vaccines work.

We need reach higher level vaccination. far giving free access safe effective vaccines enough. Callous say, point say hell let nature run course choose get vaccinated? worry retail workers deal hundreds people every day. fair put risk. Savage.

Not wrong though. Yup. precisely I'm at. important part article - ""Those dying vaccinated."" article breakthrough cases though. many unvaccinated period? want see side-by-side numbers daily basis. best way illustrate reason vaccine still hesitant people. know difference? job ask/ensure vaccinated legally can't cases unless job puts others specific risks.

This simply untrue vast majority at-will states. convince covid down-players flu, shootings car accidents dangerous enough take precautions against. point, lines set. Early June UK cases started going back due Delta, restrictions lifted, etc deaths stayed basically low ""two week lag"" point I’m surprised AZ even teachers anymore, get paid like shit treated like shit remember seeing comment long time ago predicting face masks would become permanent part life west coast California. thought completely ridiculous back then… justify contention 100% problem one side?

When say this? put words mouth.

I'm glad vaccinated. anecdotal experience seem match data. possible since EUA right Things get worse either get better organically governer steps requires masks doors. It'll interesting see mandate LA county affects numbers. Throughout pandemic similar mandates enacted usually follow behind couple weeks. Yeah I'm disputing numbers, rife. us vaccinated, us still wearing masks washing hands staying in. seem much paranoia air previously wave definately different numerically others regards severe illness death. We'll see goes. put “sanitize” quotes? That's much smaller demographic made be, someone willing listen they'd know EUA mean vaccine tested, means yet know long effective for. 

I'm sure there's plenty people *say* they're waiting full authorization, find another excuse soon granted. CDC can't reinstate universal masking. federal government enforce masks public property. states want also dramatically better healthcare now, including antibiotics. think kids / immunocompromised people can’t get vaccine. Everyone else needed step get vaccine protect them, people damn selfish.  Still, children dying en masse way adults are, maskless no. wanting COVID spread among children good reasons, children dying en masse problem. Preventing COVID spread among children possible organ damage stronger argument. reason 0? wonder many people got shot boat without even knowing Well we've seen vast majority people (read:VAST) forced mandate venue opta actually enforce said mandate. Vegas people flocking weekends even week coming celebrate see end pandemic party want mask on.

The reason 1918 flu died virus killed host quickly. people ok locked next 8 months, deserved 2 years lives stolen them. Yeah, either old already immunocompromised. Really sad. Pandemic close long majority world vaccinated. Turns Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir, Interferon regimens really work Wearing mask indoors following science! idk bs reading. Vaccine cure still run risk catching passing it. According FDA, vaccines won’t get approved till mid-winter. ... say ""Gave six people...""

Yeah that’s person giving results kinda said. It’s 3 me. think I’ll probably go tomorrow I’m really paranoid spreading anybody.  Strawman. since asked, I'm asking anybody anything, get vaccinated haven't. see lot callous attitudes, see that's helping. 100%. LA doesn’t deserve penny follow science stick CDC. gateway never ending back forth restrictions. They're already limited form. got back conference required attendees either fully vaccinated recent negative test. Clear app used verification could probably fooled better nothing. would get safe, effective vaccine infectious disease? need luck, got Pfizer Shit hit fan Even that's true, there's vaccine flu, parent probably gets kid, making ""gotcha"" statistic fall pretty flat. Said comment, vaccinated, are, going flair, I'm telling wear mask. I'm asking people care instead tuning out. care? I'm talking you.  This. Kick road, retail clerks deal it.

Goddamn CDC decision recommend vaccinated people wear masks obvious unvaccinated people would lie, point solution pandemic let rip population? vaccine easily available eligible people people still refusing vaccine. thing work people actually see loved one battle severe case covid. Even keep making restrictions many people follow CDC guidelines rest put life hold knows long. drag pandemic another 3 years hope herd immunity next spring. keep reinforcing restrictions delay inevitable. Even LA county 50% fully vaccinated, really hope lot folks. situation today different 2020, vaccine available proven greatly reduce severity covid. People still take precautions cannot put lives hold half population refuses vaccinate. uK lot vaccinated cases understanding I’m anti vaxx means. think they’re gonna willingly let things go back normal never stop moving goal post year half. You’re naive. blame parties. anti vaxxers, people let government keep pushing around.  Yeah, maybe (?) good PR say things like “get vaccinated Covid beaten! gone forever!” lol viruses don’t work like that. there’s less oomph “get vaccinated make life bearable next decade humankind.” Great news. Hope health care providers take steps. exit strategy wearing masks crowded indoor venues, especially winter. huge social benefits making permanent norm, related covid. gotta enforce mask mandates vaccinated.  people either know, care, money

Basically describing America here, pretty much applies everything around pandemic. can't correct lot overnight — buildup years mistrust, mismanagement, misgovernment, whatever wanna call it. Asian stores still required masks. Especially Missouri currently, they're getting absolutely ravaged. state barely 30% Vax rate, they're paying heavily it.

They call Missouri ""Show Me"" state nothing. I'm one wish ill people...until recently. anti-vaxxers shit people. soon went vaccinated need wear mask, anti-vaxx fucks took well. Baby Jesus loves liars.

At point, fuckers made bed, lie die too. holding country back, I'm fucking sick it. Yeah...

(Not counting kids 12 can’t get vaccine yet). never fly US, unfortunately.

Great idea!

No fly list can’t provide proof vaccination. likely keep mild, possibly shorter duration. make vaccinated people wear masks? risk. want vaccine, might well expose build kind herd immunity stop variants. perish point, fault.  No, strain, similar, worried it. strain, would've even worse Covid been. Problem lasts weeks misinformation weeks fact checked true. said dont need masks, say need two. mean Fauci even said later said nurses doctors could them.

At least tell us need use cloth mouth. 

If werent people able freely say “um sounds like bullshit” maybe id fallen lie Yes. Although I’d bet audience small sub  still get COVID, particular Delta variant, part problem you’re railing against. still spread COVID vaccinated person.

You’re part ongoing problem. think it’s effectiveness that’s getting people upset. Masks vaccinated people isn’t useful. It’s like telling people wear condoms time sex. Yes, wouldn’t worst thing also doesn’t make whole ton sense. vaccine makes mask far far far far far less useful. completely useless pretty damn close. pandemic fueled unvaccinated rightfully vaccinated people pleased go motions aren’t useful. Flu shots completely miss years regardless risk still higher mass flu shots. mask every year flu? Might well inject bleach you’re it.  understand argument kids 12 choice. people weak immune systems, existed COVID. basically told manage risk. rest population mandated govt go way protect them. 

This situation even ridiculous vaccinated told mask protect...the folks CHOOSE get vaccinated. Indeed. remember him, Gupta, called experts advising ppl wear masks. ppl already volunteering wear them. never forget that. much respect experience credentials. Experts still ppl, thus fallible. 

One thing really can't get posturing certitude. complete reversal long after. reopening California latest example, month later masks likely lockdowns soon. 

What point fully reopening saying vaxed ppl safe w/o masks new variant way? Maybe vaccines fully approved? able to? clue. 10 month old son vaccinated though 😭 Thank you, too.   Infections don’t matter, hospitalizations deaths do. COVID politicized beginning America. Ignoring fact misunderstanding it’s impact won’t vaccinate lead severe missteps CDC.

Absolutely nothing going change minds won’t get vaccinated. already saw family members die. backdoor attempts get going work. yes mean trying explain science - care.

The feds could fund state vaccination lotteries, make tax credit, people win car, partner companies sweepstakes - that’s way sway people.

COVID political issue (for refuse get vaccinated) pretending it’s nothing change vaccination rates.

Go ahead Mr. Bot, said politics COVID, take comment away. cases amongst unvaccinated though. They're surging *other* mitigations like masking social distancing dropped still lot unvaccinated people around. Asians MVP. Sigh. I’m LA. never stopped wearing mask. Made comment r/LosAngeles downvoted. Juvenile entitlement strong still. I’m vaccinated. kid 12. elderly parents immunocompromised friends. Wearing mask least still it’s nothingburger.   thought come back 2009-2010 swine flu outbreak? understanding H1N1 strain strain 1918 flu. got miserable Eventually, *number* vaccinated people level out, *percentage* vaccinated people keep climbing, increase percentage raising numerator decreasing denominator…  sounds like endgame may turning 18 leaving California. Pandemic Cali full entitlement authoritarians think they're right thing. Referring leadership citizens.  Also, vaccinated mean suffer long term effects! 

My cousin got Covid month second dose still fucked up. go hospital anything sever brain fog, can't keep focus whatever he's work struggles lot sort physical activity. 

He's 30 year old guy perfect health, many weeks passed since first got infected still recovered... least got taste smell back :/ Good thing I'm medical professional. was, knew someone eligible vaccine get showed er, try hard. I'm saying try probably 40% less hard. I've amazed number people giving governor/state gov shit federal $ still coming in. also proud general population people area willing comply. 

Now $ coming unemployment businesses want open understand pressure. I'm proud state enforcing mask mandates lockdowns early recently. 

I keep wearing mask bc fuck covid virus. want reason someone becomes sick want protect myself.

No vaccine 100%, never know something new emerge. 

Be diligent. Stay vigilant. able find Pre-Print added data total 604 patients received Covishield vaccine, 71 received Covaxin two received Sinopharm vaccine (BBIBP-CorV). Opening clubs bars change R0. changes R.

Not necessarily. limits much spike protein mutate still function. Wearing mask hardly going isolation, though. personally, holding activities (indoor dining, concerts crowds, sort thing) enough herd immunity vaccination infection whatnot local case count drops low risk level. city briefly reached point, went things weeks, cases spiking I'm back strictly outdoor dining wearing mask grocery stores again. still see family, still see friends, still work in-person go drinks weekends, sometimes put flap fabric face. big deal. so?

Which part claims true. Delusional much? stopped mass death mass hospitalization every country used. Meanwhile UK, Isreal even US seeing bigger covid numbers one even talks ""pfizer less effective expected"" jump chance talk bad Chinas vaccine.

Do think born yesterday something. 

There ZERO, literally ZERO, nada, NONE, nill chance Sinovac doesnt work. made way all, mean every frikkin vaccine till date last 70 years, produced. sinovac doesnt work, neither vaccine last 70 years.   don’t wear mask anymore (unless business says to), that’s true all. know many people situation/mindset. part 18 months. got vaccine soon possible. taught PERSON starting September throughout entire pandemic. 

I feel bad fellow citizens far gone mentally refuse vaccine, also remember Texas much bitched last year everyone take personal responsibility pandemic. “If feel unsafe don’t come out” etc etc. group picking 99.2% Covid cases requiring hospitalization now. comes point can’t held responsible assholes blatantly disregarding public health responsibilities.

Lockdown?  see not, bit late now... correct medical literature I've gone before.   though? everyone chance vaccinated yeah see thinking. Otherwise else end point? 

Maybe gradual easing would safer? 

Diving straight in, guess find around month plans out. 

I'm sure people Aus trying work vaccination target needs watching closely.  least survivability rate like 99% getting covid now.

Australia like 8 cases Covid whole state...and mandatory masks 3 weeks keep cases low / back 0. Releasing restrictions may sound fine people going get caught unwilling get vaccinated (even questionable)

can please acknowledge huge number people perfectly fine half US adults dying?

we make appeals day ""letting virus run course"" flawed strategy mutations, people can't yet get vaccinated (or still vulnerable vaccination), medical resources overwhelmed. none appeals address core problem: ""i'm fine 50% US adults uncontrollably ravaged COVID i'm angry them"" supremely fucked take.

i'm saying vaccinated-and-vulnerable person surrounded unvaccinated people. okay angry. okay feel like betrayed neighbors heavy lifting. feel things. many people claiming empathetic side casually wishing death half country's population.   bro say anti vaxxer spewing anti vaxxer bs, shut Fauci ***literally*** said 99.2%, close. show science behind vaccinated person vector?   Prevent small minded… delayed champ delayed worst went away day still lingering soreness three days (it mostly felt moved arm beyond slight movements) bit early declare hospitalizations norm, no?

We’re beginning current wave. It’s even winter yet.

Regardless numbers, young people still remain vulnerable hospitalizations, thus severe disease, including organ damage.

Headline correct. Y’all grasping straws.     That's joke. government actually loosening controls. correct Incorrect. Age adjusted deaths went 15% 2020. 
Also case-fatality rate united States ~1.8%. worst Yemen 19.6%. Peru highest deaths per 100k people 599.4. 

Now, case-fatality rate lot lower ACTUALLY know tackle it. believe check John Hopkins yourself, I'm maid. let die done want really see power vaccines compare number cases (serious) hospital admissions deaths definitely LOT lower compared first wave.

Do understand evolution? literally this.

Also, asymptomatic transmissions considerably less potent symptomatic ones especially strangers, find one damaging mistakes long list terrible mistakes mismanagement crisis, letting people believe there's difference sick / contagious be. causes people paying attention symptoms taking particular precautions actually sick contagious. deresponsabilised like children still didnt even try change popular attitudes concerning going work sick hiding symptoms cancel stuff miss work (BTW masks great help this)  Yeah I'd issue long Face Covering Social Distancing mandate removed stores. nightclubs literally opening 1 minute past midnight Monday morning (e.g. restriction officially lifted) cater largely 30 audience best one vaccine shot worst none.

I'm sitting covid delta gotten vaccines gotten covid initially. I'm tired. cnn… chance leader decided lead leave 50 individual governments. believe recent thing past months. Early late 2020 much higher death rate Thank you. I’m tears write this.

I reread post felt came across kinda shilly. immediately researched rates clots believe passing random wasn’t, I’ll never know looking blame coping mechanism.

Thank responding, think needed type something out.  UUUUUUUUUUGH! personal choice self vigilant catching spreading virus. That's freedom. ASKING others same. And, yes face something deadly hope communities around care protect help other, regardless government. Delta Australia showing 10% hospitalization rate spread almost evenly across age ranges. Also number 30 ICU ventilated.

Delta last year all. mean, definitely US type conservatives here, there's still much minority. would define conservatives Canada would fit nicely democrats south. ?  moving direction every variant. would wager young people ending hospital right vaccinated. vaccines now. like Spanish flu protection whatsoever   right, tad details please. like.... medical exam result showing clotted lung vaccine clots?  changed life drastically year protect people care enough return favor

no, didn't. wore mask scared yourself. Stop shitting yourself. seriously, it’s hard covid test first show negative accepted.  doctor Fauci WAP dance let hair challenge, I’ll get third shot  enough population got vaccinated delta could spread much country. We've trending downwards Canada despite delta dominant vaccination politicized murderous cowards here.  unfortunately cases unvaccinated people infected vaccinated people, vaccinated people still bad health impacts. Vaccines risk don’t work binary  I'm sorry hear softball team manager. always horrible lose someone close you.

It true clotting issues extremely rare side effect Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. side effect rare highest risk factor young woman, suspect extremely unlikely vaccination related - likely sad random misfortune. understand impulse seek something blame order come ordered understanding tragedy.

I would recommend talk grief counselor this. might help get feelings someone knows listen offer good advice, probably much productive mental health trying go rabbit hole identifying specific reasons probably random event.

Again, sorry loss.   Reddit worst full people think they're smarter commenters youtube fact dumb. people saying COVID nothing fear bad people saying scared healthy children going die it. Everybody seeking confirm biases quickly possible.  honestly think everyone catch Delta variant next months. see UK even high vaccination rate won’t stop transmission - also mandatory masks Monday. Mild breakthrough cases happen us point.
Your governor tone rhetoric think right thing go 100% back normal everybody chance get vaccinated. Unfortunately, possibility CDC reimplementing universal mask recommendations greater might think. I'm saying that's right thing do, course, there's pressure sides nurse unions so.

There's also case increase Delta variant point to, complicated. Yes, cases fully vaccinated people, thing is, asymptomatic, fact almost none require hospitalizations. However, concern vaccinated people might ""silent spreading"" viral variants unvaccinated people may used justify making wear masks, citing logic masks prevent people spreading virus others.

And yes, recognize ""social"" end pandemic arrived pretty much everywhere US, even traditionally ""cautious"" regions. However, mask mandates actually reimplemented, recently Los Angeles, *heavily vaccinated area*, can't carry without literally breaking law. going topsy-turvy if/when CDC actually make move, ***the states need new mask mandates (e.g. Missouri Mississippi) going least likely reimplement them, vice versa.***

So basically it'll giant shitshow. Welp... Indoor air never smelled good. CDC specified state locals can/should modify based situations. don’t see moving stance long people continue get shots hospitalization/deaths don’t somehow go back November-Feb levels. im I’m going surprised cities ask indoor masks again. Latam still getting ass kicked. México right heading upward pretty dramatically third wave infections. I'm Mexico city I've hearing seeing cases peer group families since 6-7 months ago. testing low hard get free test government many low income people even getting tested they're infected. also deal fact lot family's ignore guidelines care sick loved one. girlfriend's mom covid girlfriend staying yesterday got shit brother mom around. We've dropped food medicine came clean house once. We're helping way risk girlfriend's health (I pfizer vaccine went back states get vaccinated, scheduled receive first dose months). family care think bad ignoring mom sitting bedside. family's members (vaccinated sputnik un vaccinated) come hang check gf's mom. Makes sense health guidelines culturally people expected there, person, take care family. leading whole families getting infected spreading virus. exactly right. people become vaccinated, deaths cases we’ll see among vaccinated people. Like said, 100% people vaccinated, 100% deaths cases would among vaccinated.

Headlines type information going spread around like wildfire order freak people out. 

If want comforting evidence vaccines work broken link cases deaths, look UK COVID data since latest outbreak delta variant. Cases almost highest they’ve ever there, deaths approximately 0.  There’s quite bit quality data pointing exact opposite direction bold claim… explain that's excuse? masks work  way they're commonly used  outside models, sure. way see everyday people use them, worry they're providing false sense security.

The argument made last February/March, made post responding to, people touching masks big issue might COVID formites hands they'll transfer face get sick way. quickly learned formites main way COVID spread argument longer makes sense.

The fact never really good campaign educate people masks good properly wear one issue, agree. That's area better in. Though I'd counter saying dirty masks poorly fit N95s still whole lot better nothing. that's separate issue  masks people use touch multiple times day dirty hands absolutely worthless, even harmful.

Because long decent hygeine work COVID ward people gonna COVID hands matter touch face sometimes. even assumption people wearing mask touch face often, something know fact. Here's sad, likely true answer question:

It depend polling. Yes subways busses please end stupid mask mandate planes you’re vaccinated? 

It’s silly. end snack water whole time pick whole flight justify little relief. judgment, can’t smell anyway :) get go parks, eat restaurants, etc.

Personal responsibility supposed thing. 799, great terrible   I’m sure you’re getting downvotes this. I’m vaxxed immunocompromised masking everywhere hate hate unvaxxed can’t live life normally others. need enforce vaccines. mean implement vaccine passports everywhere NOW. Target unvaxxed population restrictions they’re allowed infect barring entry social realm. restrict life someone refuses vaccinate doesn’t to? Tell fair? see CDC backtracking unless massive surge Covid suddenly starts killing large numbers kids something similarly crazy. they. vaccine widely available free. also seem passing decision making state local governments (for better worse) seem interested reversing that. Given &lt;50% nurses also wonder much CDC actually cares opinion subject. know don't. Maybe stop wearing mask every day? mask wet.....you're wrong bro. Look one wants kid get Covid vaccines kids going take lot time get approval. 

The reason kids low risk severe illness Covid prove without doubt statistically vaccine safer getting Covid. scientific standpoint going take end risk developing side effect vaccine Covid may age group.

I’m antivax. I’m fully vaccinated. age group way lower risk Covid age groups it’s really hard get vaccine approved fast.

So meantime? Also might even get approved. anti maskers/anti vaxxers anger, lies, perceived bs “attack freedoms,” idiocy go hell. largely blame ultimately, deserve grave consequences. Biden done bad job though. think? Wearing mask right right thing  Store employees literally getting shot beat asking customers put masks on. virus vegan, care eat plants. India, country ravaged covid, many subsist plant based diet claim crucial warding respiratory pathogen. honestly don’t care others proximity masks long aren’t ‘in face’. use N95 cloth mask it. thing Iv read indicate combo combined discipline touching face, washing hands effective stopping transmission. Also choose times day less foot traffic shopping. Early morning late night. I’ve adapted pretty well. Problem many hey man, hard get soap there... 

... affect offices opening back up? Mine scheduled open around August. Majority unvaccinated people continue unvaccinated. Even witness people close suffer covid 19, still unmoved.


That fact life rest us vaccinated live with. Masks. hardly anyone FL really wears them.  
FL never really meaningful covid abatement strategies. anything leadership seems like us covid sanctuary. agree, unfortunately ship sailed. US economy burning hot already way overheated, cannot tied sort justified economic stimulus. amount money required people ""eat pride"" get vaccinated $10 even $100; likely closer $1000 average. That's substantial stimulus bill going get passed.  country listen science. Ok, 50% do.

Keep freedom!!! healthy(har har) spread covid several counties high levels Chinese vaccination. beyond dispute. one bringing death hospitalization, never said Chinese vaccines can't help there. can't provide single article says Chinese vaccines ineffective hospitalizations death, assume noone said either anti-western crusade whatever reason.

As say Chinese vaccines old fashioned type, job amazing. nothing else would still great improvement. However, MRNA vaccines exceeding everyone's expectation vaccine do, truly astounding protect recipient, also community strongly reducing spread. That's strength compared Chinese vaccines, far read, high standard set MRNA vaccines make journalists write Chinese vaccines less effective. 

As side example, Singapore, predominantly chinese country always recognized importance China, count full regimen Chinese vaccine fully vaccinated. sinophobic, picky money provide MRNA population protect better. Definitely lot stupidity issue.

It seems important... overlooked. true. scientific community overwhelming agreement vaccines prevent infections transmission, though perhaps somewhat lesser extent prevent symptomatic disease. fucking hell?? thought vaccines supposed let us take masks. even vaccines prevent mask mandates, can?

This borderline evil, actually. get away letting us return nearly complete normal contingent vaccination, snatch away? point they're basically pulling ""carrot stick"" us. think improve vaccination rates, they're crazy. k Sorry folks allergic vaccine ingredients. folks may weak immune system isnt suitable to.be vaccinated. valid reasons get vaccinated. Gee let wonder proof requirements border... wearing mask help people countries   could make required airplanes would reasonably high impact. People get damn vaccine. That's choice. Incentive hockey players get vaccinated  don’t agree you, understand point you’re making. 

Still, headline holds true. That’s started. study conducted 2020 demonstrated younger people were, still are, risk organ damage.

Whether it’s several thousands millions, doesn’t matter, disease real. People affected affected again.

There’s also data points asymptomatic mild cases suffering crippling, long-term symptoms. 

This can’t ignored. Survival versus death can’t metric policymaking.

We can’t look recent data say, pandemic’s over, let’s forget it.

That’s several people sub alluding screeching “click-bait” headlines. Sounds like good benefits... disrespecting anybody wanna continue it. even thought grocery stores could like ""Mask Monday"" one day week they're required, accommodate need protection. sure well would go tho. takeaway well.

It people (about 100) catching COVID fully vaccinated spreading fully vaccinated people rate high enough sustain community spread fully vaccinated setting. 

That novel data point. People vaccinated catching mix-vaccination community different sustained spread within fully vaccinated group.

The reason CDC says ""no masks needed vaccinated people"" research prior strains showing vaccinated person unlikely get infected - infected - likely low enough viral load inhibit meaningful spread even unvaccinated. data point contraindicates guidance. clear - it’s lab leak doesn’t mean engineered.

I'm really sorry, understand angst. :( Get vaccine hospital setting give heads regarding specific situation. many people claiming empathetic side casually wishing death half country's population.

I agree this, many people uncaring this. want anyone die, whether get vaccine.

But realistic, every adult essentially two options; get vaccinated get covid. amount mask mandates shutdowns going change this, delay it. Vermonter - looks like we're whopping increase 4-8 new cases day 13 yesterday. technically uptick, still small enough counted significant due small sample size. Statistics get weird low numbers. sounds like safe could considering able control. Pay attention future symptoms try stress almost feel like symptoms actually don’t.  Israel population 9 million (and still awaiting vaccine orders citizens). Mexico population 129 million. somehow, reporter trying claim Pfizer project Israel reason Mexico doesn’t hundreds millions doses need citizens? [biological warfare. hit nail head here. Spouse fully vaxxed. 18 year old kid vaxxed. Younger kid eligible isn’t yet vaxxed. I’m struggling weigh potential long term risks vax vs covid kid. can’t come solution. Sucks. want right thing kid community. vaccines US show effective protecting severe illness/hospitalization/death delta variant. vaccinated person catch it, symptoms often mild. Almost Covid deaths US unvaccinated people. International travel thing past. covid climate change I’m fully prepared travel way lifetime According redditors here: No. Im UC grad student we've known several weeks UC's going officially require covid vaccine 15th. They've told us expect regarding deadlines, exemptions, happens fail provide proof without exemption. We've also able submit proof health portal while.

Given sheer size influence UC system, quite clear they're able require eua vaccine.  Europe lot young people taking vaccine simply want travel abroad without taking test. guess lot people travel abroad USA, much there. I'm working boss talking unvaccinated employees getting vaccine discussing concerns. What's good info worries (excuses) different variants? instance, studies delta variant's effect vaccine's effectiveness? everyone wants get jabbed get one. mentioned previous post, still tens millions kids can't get vaccinated. I'd day maybe 2 months eligible? Yikes.   CDC said [May many states got rid mask mandates long that. rise cases started second week July, nearly 2 months later. almost certainly caused part delta variant finally growing majority cases, drop mask mandates.   What? They're hospital, already health complications. milestone we're waiting reach let people fly without masks again?

Is market saturation vaccines (i.e. everyone wants one one)? We've already reached that.

Is every adult vaccinated? said antivaxxers it.

If goal realistically hit, we're admitting we've decided make masking permanently required transit, that's valid option. Seriously, keeps writing shitty useless articles? Stop posting garbage. least bit surprised it’s naturopath I‘m not, side pond here.
I mean, feel sorry loved ones, stupid choice refuse vaccine. People Asian countries wear masks get flu.

There several problems East Asian mask analogy. starters, masks *required* disease outbreaks like current one. Anytime else, flu season not, they're strictly personal choice. guess we're seeing right majority United States. Asian-American East Asia multiple occasions, I've never actually worn mask there.

Its acceptability also questionable, reinforce ""model"" minority stereotype. East Asians naturally genetically predisposed follow rules excel academically. [The stereotype treats East Asians one homogenous group accounting diverse variation different offensive.   nope, not. antibodies, vaccines, medicine. Pandemic over.
Stop panicking. [The cases started end here. I’d like believe “over” time next year, credentials obviously make claim. challenges get ie: fall/winter surge south among unvaccinated, school year class sizes increase normal unvaccinated kids masks optional schools.

I plan preparing mask indoor public places then, resume social activities bit caution, continue take small steps toward “normalcy.” know else negative effect mental health (not mention physical health)? Long covid. Which, funny enough, appears likely young, healthy people. Yes awesome vaccine coverage. 71.5% **total population** received least one dose we’re giving second doses 1% population every day. Starting think masks vaccine bullshit

That's know next plant based diet decrease chances 73% getting covid -19

And willing make utter bullshit endangers others. ashamed be. Quite.

Everyone wants vaccine either currently available them.

If can't open now, never able open again. Flat wrong. young people know haven’t got vaccinated don’t think it’s worth virus really doesn’t affect much.  great dilemma  
  
I 20 year old pro-vaccine male living extremely vaccine sceptic country. really want get vaccinated to, allergy vaccine 13 years ago school underweight (14.7 BMI). IgE test result 73 doctors said eligible get vaccine. afraid virus vaccine various cases convulsion etc. know do. it’s security theater vaccinated. Vaccines far effective reducing infection transmission. don’t care others wear mask don’t want anymore. Wearing uncomfortable part including getting friends family vaccinated.  sides way overplayed hand politically I’m burned out. wore mask followed rules. got vaccine third day available age group wife. We’re leveraging tragedy drag country populist hellhole. Nuance basically nonexistent. I’ve long considered progressive don’t know anymore. “Yikes.” happens favorite eye roll-inducing exclamation. 

I know pandemic happened. know there. also know doomsayers life personally. People claim sky falling stock market isn’t well. friend boasts prediction New York City never coming back. doomsayers. real. among us. know people different variety think don’t know certain type can’t exist. explains post. Yikes. removed edit responding directly article US government officials’ statements coronavirus pandemic. Absolutely absurd think nothing coronavirus pandemic. real? won't. decided shut world foreseeable future. CDC totally screwed pooch handling covid. that's disappointing, one government agency always respected staying politics. Sorry loss.

Blaming vaccine that's saved probably millions lives particular death without evidence helpful. dont think two situations currently dominant variant roughly twice bad one before. feel considered state state basis depending vaccination uptake hospitalization rates. least family India vaccine rollout pretty problematic think know (along oxygen supplies bunch issues). 

For example, beginning May US hit 30+% fully/mid-40s% 1-dose, India 2% fully. No. sort thing place response horrible pharmaceutical errors past. want another Cutter labs incident. Thank you. not. resurgance covid cases countries using vaccines. beyond dispute. using logic here.

There aint country earth thats fully vaccinated sinovac, even China. countries using sinovac nowhere near vaccinated yet reason theres still covid cases. sick unvaccinated.

But course would ignore facts like these.  Hi eventually hit Canada? saw uk numbers it’s crazy still tens millions unable get vaccinated. Current CDC general guidelines show us can't go honor system unvaccinated can't follow them. propose airlines enforce this? much simpler enforce masks everyone. dramatic nonsense. Even half unvaccinated people got covid less 1 percent would die. Claiming we’re fine half people dying spite true also complete strawman. don’t think restrictions vaccinated far protect others piece mask low efficacy. Finally! I'm wanting see friends Vancouver! Thank you! Best luck you!! Another published piece completely misleading. One dose considered vaccinated. Period. wish would also break many breakthrough cases Johnson &amp; Johnson vs. mRNA. messaging science vaccine efficacy almost bad messaging masks was. Protection hospitalization still high even delta. hard time believing country see overwhelmed hospitals. responded directly you. Sorry can’t understand ; it’s quite easy. However also somewhat political nature rules here. It’s still important relation vaccine awareness denial . I’ll attempt explain it’s political. probably removed. 

It’s different mandated vaccines go school. different narrative. operation warp speed resounding success time don’t trust vaccines? throwing chaos system? Hope helps. want wear mask plane? used always worry catching cold something flying, never thought wearing mask, pre-pandemic. I'd much rather wear mask avoid breathing everyone's exhalation eat shitty bag free pretzels. feel Covid become political. mean, countries complete control dictate borders. literally countries wet dream moment. wouldent want keep lockdowns bullshit rhetoric going on? 

/sarcasm btw point vaccines ease take precautions forever, unsustainable long term.

I disagree. point vaccines significantly reduce number severe cases. take vaccine say ""fine, let drop precautions"". vaccine 100% effective.

I'm advocating ""precautions forever"", ""precautions much reasonable"" always part plan. 

People Asian countries wear masks get flu. know why? flu vaccines deadly covid. - wear reduce spread thus subsequent mutations.

It's good thing towards everyone else.  Gotta love Governor HVAC firing person charge vaccine outreach National Immunization Awareness Month.  AMLO Mexico shown, pandemic revealed competent (or incompetent) governments around world are. point stop wearing mask cause covid isn’t going away. Never? think hundreds thousands Americans died covid society ground halt?



Well, explains posts. Yikes. Focusing number cases metric make sense, drive narrative. 

Old people large vaccinated (not all, most). Old people ones mainly hospitalized die (not 100% mainly). cases going up, primarily among people serious consequences disease. Tucker got vaccinated.

Let get straight though.

David vaccinated. mildly antivax. 

Then, later, vaccinated person breakthrough infection spread David. David got sick. 

Then changed views become pro vaccine.

This unlikely backwards, want make sure I'm getting saying. Exactly. bad information dictate policy?  standard never zero death. could wrong deaths seem low amongst fully vaccinated people. Low enough hard time validating restrictions. nurse’s unions complaining new guidance entire two months since introduced haven’t backtracked far.

The scenario could see backtracking vaccine resistant variant shows starts putting ton vaccinated people ventilators, far Delta isn’t it.

The thing Delta’s really changed can’t begin let guard one dose anymore need wait two weeks second dose decent protection.  hard time making compulsory order participate society gets full approval. Even take years. Requiring masks indoors unvaccinated folks acceptable solution fully approved.

The science says perfectly safe accounts, bottom line fully approved strong hypothesis. need make mandatory. 

Maybe I'd pharmaceutical companies shielded liability. force upon everyone knowing recourse bad reaction beyond crazy. Weren’t remote Fall 2020? agree don’t think actually happen. don’t think public institution require vaccine EUA. Every, mean everyone, know feels same. reddit board full panicky people reality.

Where find stats?  Quick, where's good guy vaccine shoot people's arms?! Enjoy norovirus! Yeah, really think become recommendation winter public transport maybe healthcare providers decide want mandate them.

People often say taken precautions flu before, health system needing ages. need going lockdowns, need take seriously. know mild Delta case week point. I‘m willing wait booster ready next mutation appeared already. That’s risk I‘m willing take. missed first bullet point ""When 15 people, 15 within couple days going close zero, that's pretty good job we've done."" know it’s completely irrational.

Have books coming pandemic. Like they’re trying profit us. are. know it’s irrational makes mad. I’ve honestly heard short long term complications Covid. yet hear serious complications vaccine small % users die. % less getting hit lightning way less getting killed Covid. chances fine. Like actually fine swimmer wanting vaccine swimming sport 0.01 second. knows vaccine might impact elite athletes performance. rest us, impact preventing getting serious issue Covid. nonsensical. Ever need go ER? could worse second third infection, norm.

Well linking NIH peer reviewed paper bother. must suck kid antivaccers. Imagine wanted get vaccinated parents said legally get permission. makes worse lot areas person school starting soon going kids class want shot, CDC approved, get parents. vast majority country (assuming US) ain't going back. Outside liberal large cities nothing getting rolled back. Blows mind average daily deaths January 3k. really fully rails election. use numbers month half ago get headline wanted. Back present, daily deaths far lower guns, cars flu combined. 97% covid hospital admissions unvaccinated according article 99% deaths unvaccinated people according basically every article. Looks like anti-vaxxers letting Darwinism take over. I'm going efficacy rate vaccines. I've seen claims 93% 99.3% hospitalized died vaccinated.

But find hard believe got vaccine getting tested. source this? remember NDT downplaying covid. said something effect mass shootings, indicate relative risk, think said avoid covid.

Now, another famous reality TV star say cases would go 15, that's another matter... F$Ck anitvaxxers. vaccines roughly 90% effective. one argument they’ll say “it’s persons choice you’re vaccinated, don’t need worry others” it’s 100% effective. another breath they’ll say, “see, still catch you’re vaccinated, take risk”.

I wish would understand/believe doctors scientists people get vaccinated, safer are. listen politicians, politicians tell skeptical experts. polio, mumps . . . ?

No big deal . . . Like gun owner likely misfired. Actually 0,088% 2300, equal 2 cases. 2 cases hospitalization 46 cases something like 5% cases. article mentions 3 cases later, seems error.

Anyway, without control group, pretty hard judge. numbers could incredibly good bad. Strange research like one. Problem many people willing tell fact one really knows. speculated major factor time doses, well bell rung. Seems like booster consideration next thing. even better booster tweaked Delta. approach seems take long way much damage done booster get arms. Public health science needs streamline methods keep pace virus -- clearly happening now. bloated creeping bureaucracy uncooperative population, virus kicking ass. way. small part world though.   point, cares. Take vaccine, protected let nature take course everyone doesnt. They’re Twitter Fox News. People like Alex Jones Ben Shapiro outlets. Basically entire sphere conservative “news” (fantasy)  probably Joe Rogan knows either   don’t evolve.

What talking about. Protection/immunity full proof 100% thing. previous exposure protect high degree. nothing 100% viruses  Exactly! 
But govt would broad answer believe. knows. wait FDA approved. European countries already mandating full EMA approval. Israeli friends stated follow new mandate anyway, similar situation time right first mandate lifted.

IMO new mandate driven politics science, new mandate occurring around time leadership change. Besides, Pfizer still effective preventing severe cases Delta, anyway. heartache! Maybe done encourage people get vaccine, right lot articles saying vaccine good enough prevent symptomatic many people hesitant get sinovac, even though vaccine good enough prevent death hospitalization according chilean research. 99% deaths unvaccinated people. way country support another lockdown anti-vaxxers heels dug far realize killing political protest.  I’m sure agree fully original poster. don’t think it’s spike protein dangerous. viruses still mutate… aka evolve. still genetic information gets replicated, sometimes mutations occur. again, normalize income education race trying cast shade. fit basic definition tragedy—ones hubris actions directly leading fall. know lady got covid twice last year, got vaccinated back April.

The [evidence points substantially deadly. vaccines also reduce CFR IFR overall reasonably lower last spring.

Based timeline cases rising (mostly last week), think we'd expect deaths rise yet. there's also possible way around deaths rising; 1.0% CFR (note IFR decently lower CFR) 10,000 cases day month ago would 100 deaths ""for day"", 40,000 cases day that's 400 deaths ""for day"". deaths may happen weeks months (which lot 100 daily deaths whole time period - many cases much longer ago still case counts way higher).

Well, 10% chance catching COVID everyone wore masks stayed home year. we're done R(t)~1.5 end like 40% baseline chance catching COVID. turn reduced 80-90% vaccination (probably similar previous infection) delta, chance hospitalization/death reduced much smaller factor test positive.

The correct way think COVID attack rates nothing, 90%+ population would catch it. Making arguments based fewer catching prevented bad logic. Vaccination essentially counts toward 90%, even lower significantly (since there's less final reproductive rate thus less gliding exceeding herd immunity).

Oxford-AstraZeneca still important role play, particularly developing world, pushing Oxford branding could well important getting people vaccinated.   fully agree everything said fair...that's probably true regarding next flu vs vaccinated people dealing covid. Well put. next flu lot dangerous covid currently vaccinated people. Wearing mask stores big deal. 

Wearing mask day work really annoying. 

But real problem wearing mask social situations completely sucks joy others know. 

I'm part improv comedy theater. wonderful community one thing brings joy life. barely made shutdown thanks numerous fundraisers many amazing people coming together save something love. Everyone required fully vaccinated, liberal community they're lying. finally reopened weeks ago people crying joy relief actually made it.

Another mask mandate destroy us. nothing. one wants sit audience inhaling mask every time laugh, never happens anyway since performers can't see other's faces communicate. cover face even more, day work, going stay home. 

And freely available effective vaccines enough government give us freedom back, nothing is, never end. things bring joy never possible again, case honestly see point life. 

I'm glad happy masks. Many others can't. That's need understand. understand point continuing this, impossible help. Flu deaths higher several flu variants circulating population given time flu immunization protects implying suck, certainly want catch it. issue there's science here. Israel making press releases without releasing data back up.

Science quite clear delta really, really bad though. doubt that. I’m saying WANT every 6 months. I’m saying that’s recommendation found immunity waned fast, I’d shrug shoulders it. Covid fear mongering still generates clicks.

For browsing, say fear mongering likely click article already well informed likely reading reacting statistics driven would never see headline first place. people unvaccinated point, they're going read think ""oh yeah, probably get vaccinated."" Therefore, purpose see catered speed simply upset.  live I'm Florida. may rented condo (I thrilled it, family vaccinated except 1 year old). 
We brought wipes, lysol air spray, etc. cleaned everything. hand sanitizer lots soap. unit AC system, worried that. 

The issue going out. beach wasnt issue, everywhere else was. Open windows refresh air house. big deal.  fucked up. family sound like real dullards. offense day fatigue shot 1 close month gradually improving fatigue shot 2. everyone know gotten shots, worst experience anyone already gotten COVID.

IDK help make worries worse, also ton anxiety around medical issues (and almost panic attack getting first shot), even experience much better almost everyone know gotten virus without vaccinated (one guy totally asymptomatic, lucky fucker). 1. Almost nobody 18 vaccinated. gives entire population group among vaccines almost nothing prevent high rate exponential spread.

2. half doses AZ, well Delta.

3. Delta really, really bad. US growth rate higher UK's, many countries well. UK month ahead everywhere else since travel India. thirties Australia. believe earliest get mine mid September, probably likely October. family sick week. We’ve tested negative Covid several times never lost smell taste. bad cold think.  state would implement thing likely need it. They're going add onerous requirements restrictions majority vaccinated population. states need run politicians would never implement thing.

Missouri needs it, yet never even mask mandate begin with. AZ begs differ. wants vaccine either currently available them.

Untrue. currently allowed second dose close first. ones dying type ppl want fasten seat belts. Remember literally entire generation convince American public buckling could save life, think vaccines similar. Hahahaha really shit florida water. tally ho’s though, I’ll give that. What? still is, hasn’t changed. It’s cultural/linguistic region Americas vs continent. think I’m afraid restrictions actual virus point. It’s caused much anxiety trauma. virus stay, need overcome anxiety move life vaccinated person. can’t live isolation again. Depression creeps thinking it. French love protesting english love losing devastating football games doesn’t. Make right doesn’t all. Except see “improvements transmission”. can’t find solid metric timeline. imagine frustrating locals fully vaccinated right thing getting vaccinated.  Single dose Pfizer. Second dose due 2.5 weeks starters would nice still pandemic task force working action plan instead 50 governors winging practically guidance. Arguing personal responsibility essentially arguing mandating vaccines :|  8. Vaccine alone, however, may protection contracting infection 677 patients whose samples studied, 85 got infected taking first dose. rest 592 received doses got Though study effect vaccines, noted among 677, 604 received Covishield, 71 Covaxin two received China's Sinopharm vaccine.   It’s part North America Latin America.  lot anti-vax FUD comments barely toeing line. final warning. know what's childish someone deal consequences actions. UC Wow Reddit really filled bunch kids lmao retroactively make right time.

Just like every time flattened curve, proving pro-covid crowd right said big deal right thousands dying.

Both true. wrong back right now.

You get pick choose listen science data. science said vaccine resistant strain there, data said test positivity rates active cases low enough reopen given vaccination rates.

New shit came light vaccine resistant strain emerged vaccination rates plateaued.

A foolish consistency hobgoblin little minds. helpful answer you, definitely alone. read LA County news yesterday could feel blood pressure anxiety spike get down. long strenuous bike ride calm down, lol.

I think lots us stoic 2020 starting uncover scars last 1.5 years left us. hear point lot people choice manage risk jobs (server, school teacher, etc) circumstances like adults high risk (and probably vaccinated) send kids schools 1,000+ kids every day, basically small rock concert, hope don’t bring home. Many areas without “lockdowns” aren’t offering online school. 

The thing say “high risk group” think small margin population. Diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular, pulmonary diseases cover huge slice US population. Can’t remember ethic trend continues one time Latino black patients worse outcomes. 

I’m high risk vaccinated fortunate enough able control every risk could take. everyone fortunate. it’s you. It’s preventing spread others. Children can’t get vaccinated yet, can’t get vaccinated medical reasons, vaccines 100% effective. 

People still hospital dying covid. don’t care?     uncomfortable reading things everyday like ""people dirty,"" ""people unclean"" ""people disgusting."" 

It feels like 'othering', though commenters saying: ""over filthy mass, whilst bubble cleanliness therefore superior"". 

I get comes from, spread disease human-human obviously terrifying. 

Please try remember people people first foremost, vectors disease look upon condemn. problem that’s articles indicating. read covering story, blaming anti vax morons, saying due rising cases even among vaccinated. someone like doesn’t research…well initially looks bad. done best clarify also don’t want worst migraine life either lol. FORCE TAKE IT! Stop pretending isn’t possible! government done many difficult things people thought “wasn’t allow to.” spike proteins created result vaccine expected last body around 3 weeks. 

Can anyone ELI5 this? provide good link somewhere explains well?

I thought entire point vaccine causes bodies produce spike proteins, immune system attacks, exposed COVID-19, kick straight gear recognises threat knows do. 

If that’s case, spike proteins survive long? Shouldn’t immune system destroy matter days, instead freely flowing around bodies weeks? Well, say one hospitalized unvaccinated relative.

No one ever said 100% effective infection. don’t get people don’t get this. prevent serious illness death. Flu vaccines 100% effective infection either. problem is, using total cases one metric stand reinforce mandates not, totally wrong. Unless hospitals get completely overun, reason take step backwards  baseline variant question. severity previous variant, 200% increase infections would equal 200% increase hospitalizations.  They’re getting hospitalized hopefully it’ll change mind, especially seeing 5 us gave to, vaccinated, weren’t hospitalized. Make mistake, even state decent fax numbers, likely forced back lock states like this. r/yawn Let’s draw conclusions Oxford trial complete. It’s weird many people sub rooting something could possibly help. Let’s hear reputable source start poopooing things crazy antivaxx friend/family say might work. Both, truthfully. I'm fully vaccinated hearing people get COVID (with harsh symptoms) despite fully vaxxed discouraging. also starting feel comfortable things felt relieved feel like life might ""normal"" idea going back sort limited/lockdown state so, discouraging That's helpful perspective think I'm beginning lose. appreciate response. reading story actually seem fair. patients. clearly made bad decision admitted guilt. trump tweeted recorded video getting vaccinated said “My supporters need vaccinated take country back.” help idiots 12 years old less age cutoff separates kids prepubescents teenagers already experiencing physical particular hormonal changes associated puberty. Obviously kids earlier, others later, children undergo massive changes puberty kicks in. I’m talking anecdotes related nurses think it’s hoax. I’m talking statistics, show nurses 50%, physicians hovering around 96%. 

Sorry, don’t care masks anymore, amazing vaccines longer need rely masks mitigating tool vaccines came out. Maybe nursing group/org cared much covid, would strive make vaccines nurses mandatory like Houston Methodist. Houston Methodist threatened fire every employee didn’t get vaccine - result threat, 153 25,000 let go. pace slowed, still adding ~1.8M first doses per week. FDA approves closer fall, see another surge shots open door mandatory vaccinations schools, companies, insurance, etc.

That surge get us around ~70% need + natural immunity reduce delta spread. that, endemic optional boosters every 6-12 months IMO. Scared getting sick, scared losing another year? both? vaccines effective preventing Delta

Yes

It's like Yelp reviews. People far less likely post review everything perfect, people can't wait complain something goes wrong.

You're seeing anecdotes vaxxed people tested positive (and asymptomatic mild symptoms). seeing posts millions fully vaxxed individuals went crowded places get infected, one's posting that. heard? vaccine contains tracking chips powered 5G cellphone towers. believe me, link sources facebook. need boosters always thing. live protocol developed live front you.  never expected know 12 month horizon generous thought. vaccine durable variants less aggressive maybe decision would different. facts baked need pivot boosters decide proper 95th percentile time last shot get it. update protocol saying get vaccine today get 3 shots 2 4 week back back another 6 9 months out. unheard vaccines. think bit optics battle, admit ok science shifted early warning flares going prepare move forward.  


 
Those want shots get covid like, fan look people going stupid. protect want protected higher normal level. Scott right carrying recommendation vaccine wanes since dumb people dumb get shot offered spread would herd like buffering. agree find level headed even paid vaccine maker wants sell 1 unit  Yes, article England. get 2nd dose next week (yay!) I'm 40 return home May. Lots people ages 18 40 yet get 2nd, older delayed, wait minimum 8 weeks 2 doses. Exactly. Plus age group that's likely die Covid also age group that's likely breakthrough cases. elderly continue die even vaccination, thankfully much much lower rate. everyone school vaccinated what’s issue? take vaccines aren’t working then. BTW vaccinated. Won’t getting 3rd shot whatever gonna keep things restricted.   look HVAC engineering. carefully consider number air changes per hour (ACH) add things like HEPA filtration systems.

It possible office buildings excellent airflow, even windowless rooms. question many employers invested upgrading systems year. hope so! family wary year. everyone’s vaccinated don’t think we’ll go back social distancing again. We’ll take risk getting sick mentally drained isolating, missing family members, never seeing children socialize, etc. It’s sad life live.  live NJ. alma mater requiring vaccine everybody, they’re still Stage 2, means masks, distancing, regular asymptomatic testing, dorms restricted people absolutely can’t commute, staggered schedules classes. 

They also said Stage 3, whenever happens, still include strictly enforced masks social distancing. They’re even allowing 5-10 person gatherings among vaccinated people. 

Policies like makes wonder endgame pandemic. There’s zero Covid option, either accept level risk point live like forever. Anyone else feel like hope like, second, they're back feeling scared again? sure am.   know many sub opposed mandate exactly reason -- increases distrust safe &amp; effective vaccines have.

But follow mother's logic. know rising case count largely enough people vaccinated? turns vaccines work.  news friend justify little relief

This pathetic statement. sure curcumin research backing ivermectin vit downvotes? states need new mask mandates (e.g. Missouri Mississippi) going least likely reimplement them, vice versa.

Missouri never mask mandate. St. Louis KC did, couple larger cities might have. parts state cases surging never mask mandates, surprise one. state run idiots. Title sounds like SyFy movie experimental military vehicle virus runs amok, menacing scantily-clad women. result, cases occur population, chances variant bypasses protection vaccine increases.

Not quite, although sort correct. individual virus equal chance mutating, vaccinated much lower viral load. Much fewer individual viruses person means chances mutation much lower someone no/low immunity.

As everything pandemic, balancing act. Opening closing seems thought processes going on, seems bit careless balancing. I'd prefer ease restrictions gradually; example open workplaces public transport make masks mandatory enclosed spaces (including nightclubs pubs, except people sat outdoors). Also, like China, let's brave stop anti-vaxxers enjoyment public, lol. Fuck 'em. could like antivaxxers protest, might effective arguing Reddit. they're fully vaccinated they've done part. weeks debate hard conversations got anti vaccine mother commit vaccine appointment last week. Today texted “since LA bringing back mask mandate must think masks don’t work”. apparently changed mind. get one parents vaccinate KNOW heart one I’m sure that’s gonna possible again. remember sub upvoting post masks working Covid19 one week

Then next week slinging around new buzzword ""anti-maskers"" like amazingly clever heckin doggos say that? asked meantime? I’m open suggestions.

You spam threads subreddit reacting.  Might delta variant, starting cold symptoms day left starting family week still dealing immediate family (5 others) symptoms now, vaxxed except two year old Nephew.

Could cold I've never one last long. covid I'm concerned entire daily got since everything I've told assured vaccines offered level protection. Every single one needs fired blacklisted industry. get vaccinated, forever. qualified work healthcare, period.  I'm pro-vax frightening. There's way hell would ever ok country sound like speak experience. Haha  right here, hospitalizations/deaths staying low also _logically_ prevent lockdowns ever needing happen again.   I'll go without mask, outside. within personal circle, large. fuck inside places like grocery stores airports. 

I want things ever governments need adapt long term. personal safety level. I've wanted wear mask years avoid viruses socially acceptable US. hope be, give fucks anymore not. Depends mean herd immunity. Herd immunity enough vaccinated people virus can't spread dies (as measles enough vaccinated) isnt ever going happen delta. apparent double dosed may get seriously ill catch spread still. end position covid reduced illness similar flu forever circulating, low death rates everyone country either vaccine caught virus least already. question timing many hard way easy way  Perfectly legitimate take. keep mask basically reasons. need it. need wear it. 

Too many people act like asked wear mask equal getting kicked nuts every day. valid comparison. far greatest risk covid first infection unvaccinated person - experiencing naive immune system. amount NPIs ever reduce risk first naive infection, delay rate naive immune systems encounter virus. eventually, will. infected people endanger people around them, whether infections take place month year. risk short period time less risk long period time equals risk rest us people stubbornly refuse get shot. People want add protection masking families limiting exposure crowds whatever degree possible transmission high. can't avoid infections happening. Im even republican sounds like TERRIBLE damn idea.  silly. England right right thing reopening well.  Guardian way extreme covid coverage. say couldn’t travel internationally? fundamentally different going forward. want quarantine two weeks it’s problem. give time you’ll see border restrictions come back on.

Still, military lots ways make life harder vaccinated even without mandating it. Vaccines way out. We’re behind power curve delta likely need booster two (as variants come out) move pandemic mode endemic mode.

Delaying “old normal” prevents death manner high risk groups - even vaccinated.  thing UK unlock we'd end pushing wave winter great expect flu make resurgence later year seeing little immunity population- open now, we?

People vaccinated getting infected fairly large numbers (20% rate unvaccinated based efficacy numbers) - would great CDC tracking breakthroughs weren’t hospitalizations. Breakthroughs aren’t “vaccine failures” time still greatly alter persons quality life long term (generally higher risk).

The vaccine offers protection poor outcomes (ICU/death) it’s far guaranteed vaccination prevent bad things happening vaccinated people. good.. delta really bad  sympathy limited vaccine refusers, necessarily unvaccinated. ICU's completely full places (southern Missouri) Indeed. learned never ask ""Do believe science?"" Rather, question ask ""Do understand science behind \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?""

Also, need stop looking raw case numbers be-all end-all metric, especially vaccinated. Again, article says they’re OK. 

As people get vaccinated, vaccinated people test positive. statistically necessary. since know vast, overwhelming majority cases among vaccinated asymptomatic mildly symptomatic, (and should) become big deal vaccinated person tests positive. Herd immunity achieved without high percentage. Even targeted distribution key. second point, selection pressure “can” trigger mutations need passable. seeing enough viable particulates leaving vaccinated host chance new variant coming highly vaccinated area remains low. true beyond coronavirus. sun shining, I've ordered curry cracked beer.

That's losing game. merchant Gareth Southgate  lot ""anecdotal"" evidence already Covid, chances complications/death vaccine lot higher. would avoid till real studies done.

The vaccine manufacturers/health industry refusing antibody tests vaccination. Antibody tests vaccination mandatory, properly analyze benefit/cost ratio vaccinating people already Covid.    personally see big deal requiring masks indoors vaccinated delta numbers up. It'll lead less breakthrough cases vaccinated. right thing keep things slightly control now. last forever - everything temporary. fine balancing act.

Also would rather hope would working adults.
(meaning adults still catch disease) What's point then?
Kids wont die covid. Kids 99% wont get hospitalized due covid.
There point vaccinating children.   apply Kidneys? Ty  Honestly someone grew YouTube, Vine etc etc, uses TikTok, I'd say TikTok might actually one influential platforms ever existed Thanks insight. Lucky vaccine then, hopefully antibodies I'm terrified needles.

I'm also fully vaccinated 8\]

I even feel 1st shot, felt 2nd one slightly. nurses super cool immediately started conversation realised far away needle I'm trying look :D

I think media zoomed-in footage help us regard. things super tiny IRL. 400 000 000 covid cases (im counting unreported also antigen cases counted oficial pcr ""database"") certainly lot kids...
I understand nobody wants kids die. time thousand kids probably die traffic accidents tomorrow... remember mandatory vaccines 'passports' conspiracy  might wanna take look  needed vaccinate youngest first could get back life then, let middle aged people stay home couple months. 

Vaccinating vulnerable first let party, asking ultra-low-risk to, insane. seasonal flu continues evade previous year's vaccine? flu vaccines target hemagglutinin, analogous spike. interacts cell surface receptors (in case sialic acid receptors) facilitates infectivity. Yet every year predominant hemagglutinin subtype different enough effectively recognised adaptive immune system, whilst still remaining infectious. still require masks vaccinated individuals?  won’t. Le sigh. Awes     see logic; create peak rather Winter next Spring literally gamble based modelling. I'd concerns belief Government would reverse course bodies start piling (if do) think honesty. Think trying prove kind point. Let's see happens..... ideal world, endgame would vaccines leading rapidly herd immunity eradication. need smallpox vaccine anymore.

Unfortunately, seem enough antivaxxers herd immunity might possible, endgame might virus becoming endemic. likely happened 1918 flu pandemic -- seasonal flu likely still includes descendants pandemic, still get seasonal flu vaccine every year (or should). years, also likely mutated less deadly.

So think anyone actually knows good place draw line actually calling over.

Maybe you, though. throw mask yet, doubt total lockdown makes sense... vaccines effective new variants, also less likely spread unvaccinated. far greatest concern plan. It’s Americans collectively trustworthy matters. we’re liable get bunch QAnoners trying flee imagined government vaccination kidnapping. suggest coronavirus isn’t real issue?  know people it. wear one airport recently feeling wearing wet socks. annoying makes irritable.

Efficacy yes, short term safety yes, think it’s fair say don’t know confidently couldn’t cause long term side effects complications. think know it’s _unlikely_ to, _do know_ COVID causes long term side effects complications, think it’s hard make valid risk assessment vaccine isn’t better choice. don’t think hesitant folks crazy stupid think are. They've done incentives. 

My city ""free joint"" one. sounds morbid feel bad people can't get vaccinated poorer countries, could big benefit globally.

Agreed, morbid strong possibility improved conditions many ways, especially comes voting numbers. many variables involved double vaccinated individuals hospitalized died. Certainly, would expect likely underlying conditions involved.

I would think spike cases would warrant faster response.  Numbers going southern states masking virtually non-existent. I’m saying masking doesn’t work, people act like masks forcefield they’re not. loose surgical mask/cloth mask pointless, especially even contagious variant. people don’t know mask correctly.   teach 17 year olds. open person last year masks. two kids hospitalized. was…doable… masks. year, won’t masks!

Please kind service/retail workers - lives get lot worse. mask mandate? need worry kids getting ill. someone UK schools open since March primary schools never needed masks, reading comments here, like everyone gone mad. barely point.

So mandate masks numbers go down. allow masks numbers shoot back up.

I'm dont think masks issue. Haha thanks Kids still risk. comments don’t mention virus mutating. That’s probably bigger problem now. It’s going continue spread amongst unvaccinated continue mutate could potentially mutate point current vaccines ineffective.   need keep schools open matter case count. Covidits Mandating vaccines everyone would spark much larger uproar people know gotten Covid recently (in last month) people vaccinated. 3 vaccinated got Covid one else. communism one.

And two allowed masks way soon. COVID fucking spread like wildfire wear masks.


Thanks stupid fucking Covidits guy above.  Sorry. become win situation less 2 billion people alive then. fucking important. Approximately 75 million deaths planet population less 2 billion, versus 4 million deaths population almost 8 billion. zero question pandemic deadly, yet somehow managed survive. 20s apparently even pretty fun, prior great depression. legitimately surprised happening? Real honest question.

I felt like inevitable months prepping another bad wave thanks incompetent leadership selfish assholes (both anti pro vaccine). Since beginning, we've heard children badly affected, all, covid. They're fine. could always get covid vaccination, DRASTICALLY reduced rate. Delta seems little bit better evading vaccine, enough super concerned about. Also, vaccines work extremely well preventing serious illness unlucky enough get infected. people end hospitalized dead, wonder counted scary breakthrough cases tracked down. one talking Israel’s research 1 3 chance getting infected delta exposed PFIZER VACCINE??

This huge. place USA?  


haven't heard US CDC based guidance surrounding reduced transmission vaccinated individuals Public Health England study showed 40% reduced household transmission vaccinated vs unvaccinated index cases. Alpha dominant variant UK - % reduction undoubtedly less Delta. Would good see numbers UK could easily virtually reduction household transmission anymore infectious antibody evading variant (antibody evasion evident massive first dose reduction efficacy, may mainly cell immunity working vaccines now, least ones allow develop first place - aka inactivated ones).   Honestly. want wrong. public want bad news. get it. I've front lines since day one fighting this. feel like I'm dream sometimes. want help protect people. pandemic unvaccinated

Kids still vaccinated. I'll feel lot better entire population get vaccine. Right can't really say purely people made choice protect themselves.

You also gotta hope vaccination efforts keep variants undoubtedly emerge virus allowed free-for-all among disappointingly high number unvaccinated folk. get variant resistant vaccine current ones, quickly becomes problem again.

Yup. Literally 1st thing thought of. Mid August would near training camps would start NHL

Canada legit made exceptions covid restrictions around NHL operations. actually wholly joke. think could see coming though, yeah? mean I’m fully expecting variant defeats vaccine another complete lockdown/zombie apocalypse phase. It’s can’t nice things. Stupid people. It’s one year late, K thx bud correct. misquote says time idiotic thing point say Fauci liar.  Unfortunately virus distinguish refuse vaccinated vs. vaccinated soon they’re eligible. Either way, they’re unvaccinated risk spreading it. parents always say good things 40s helps, grandmother says 50s 60s pretty good too.   I'd used analogy ""it's like telling people wear condoms whilst receiving handjob,"" feel tad accurate. Either way agree generally, least mRNA vaccines (CDC come say already...anyone got J&amp;J vaccine previously get booster shot, probably Pfizer see data...solely Pfizer's dose per shot 30ug vs. Moderna's 100ug). So? We're parents. Vaccines endgame. enough people vaccinated. Let’s base stupidity half country go there. Cya year say told so. Florida run dictator actively hiding numbers so...   negative test last two days proves nothing person’s current status. day test _taken_ including days results returned two days after. Unless person quarantined days could still covid - even false negative test. Same, sir/ma'am 8 billion humans, questions asked. risk always overwhelmed hospitals. Even flu, people get sick die. We’re putting Covid genie back bottle. People die. It’s expected. breaking point overwhelmed hospitals. see again, we’ll restrictions. don’t know enough vulnerable people population reach breaking point again, might happen. does, we’ll lockdown again. can’t function without availability ER rooms.  know, getting sick cold keeps immune system strong.  may become problem, yes, basic math really cover situation. UK far different distribution population density compared US (727/square mile vs 93/square mile respectively), uses different vaccines, vaccinated different age groups different times US. creates much different situation react virus differently. truly know happen. Could milder bump case numbers rounded top, could huge spike. time tell. One thing feel certain death rates much lower.  give shit anti-vaxers. care mutations unable get vaccine, I'm appalled others aren't. depressing far world changed major problem still even vaccinated people sounding nuts anti-maskers anti-vaxxers start. Youtube full video editor video lengths cut 15 - 60 seconds. constraints, creates really creative content. lead hospital overrun though, kind whole point restrictions first place. virus gets control unvaccinated population, currently 150 million people America, that's lot medical attention resources required. phony drugs proven useless merely works marketing department lmfao Well also children can’t get vaccinated yet Seriously, except make people think vaccines work? There's incentive get sends message continues anyway. Depends whether believe vaccinated moral obligation protect unvaccinated. Great question. cheeky, seems Reddit incredibly vocal confident population covid virologists.    US population 103 million 1918. It’s 332 million today.  Time. waiting determine long term effectiveness. wore masks close effective, more, vaccines. that's 95%+ population wore masks*

This true. Quit spreading misinformation. makes feel better, late 30’s person, high school probably least enjoyable phase life. best memories experiences high school. totally sympathize, you’ve got lot look forward to!  Unfortunately, feel correct this. Let’s hope not, time tell. Well unfortunately people still catching COVID even fully vaccinated since April/May. Good news symptoms people reporting mild requiring hospitalization. read people's experience /r/COVID19positive   envy nihilism.  petty. understand totally agree you. Good question! 6 NY Yankees players test positive corona quarantining... despite vaccinated.

well fuck recent negative test thing makes useless. Big deal. guy tested negative yesterday, went bar hopping last night coming event. Let’s hope reality. 3: accept people want vaccine going get sick many die. Global Spanish flu deaths 24 months: ~75 million (approx)
&amp;nbsp;

Global Covid deaths 16 months (so far): 4.07 million

&amp;nbsp;

Even fact total deaths may harder record back then, clear Spanish flu deadlier. Covid death rates America helped lack support Trump presidency. problem UK still many unvaccinated people. 10-25% population protection (either vaccination natural infection). That's 6.8 17 million people still get infected. positive large portion elderly protected vaccination. really wish people would understand  concept airborne virus.  Yikes see issue masks, fact many people still wearing cloth masks. wish people access quality masks.

I'm riding poverty line, family stocked kn95 kn95 masks. wear leave home, exceptions. Even 8 year old wears mask 100% happy (her masks puppies them). stay away mouth breathing super easy. worn hours issues. husband mailman walks 16 mi/day. wears mask day fine it, too.

Proper masks absolutely help mitigate risk. I'm big fan. I'll probably wear masks forever, tbh. help allergies bunch... getting sick bonus, spreading germs others pretty sweet, too.

(My whole family vaxxed except 8yr old) wrong mandated vaccines?

Holding someone forcing get shot want exactly mentality we're trying debunk. NO. drop idea all. enforce harshly. Make non-arbitrary. vaccination, entry.

No movie theatre, restaurant, concert, coffee shop, sporting events.

Working wonders France. 1 million vaxxed since *announcement* policy total 926,000 people, 35, booked jabs since French president’s Monday evening address**, Niox-Chateau said. health minister, Olivier Véran, confirmed almost million appointments booked, “which means thousands lives said 21 July anyone wanting visit theatre, cinema, sports venue festival audience 50 people would need show health pass proving either fully vaccinated tested requirement extended bars, cafes, restaurants, shopping centres, hospitals, long-distance trains planes 1 August, president said. Free Covid tests, meanwhile, end September, “to encourage address watched 22.4 million people, Macron also said vaccinations would mandatory health workers, retirement home staff others working vulnerable people, sanctions fully vaccinated September.

Every sane governor U.S. thing immediately. Anti-vaxxers 2 choices: get damn shot stay home.  Literally strains “evade” vaccine. vaccine challenge. clarify meant harder organically find substances weed legal. states illegal weed guy likely knows shrooms guy coke guy could leverage network. cant go ask dispensary clerk come hookup lol horrible fucking idea. ""Hey, get shot we're going remove healthcare system.""

Think rationally, that's exploitation clearly unwealthy individuals. would cause riots streets. anyone car isn’t following guidelines, riders drivers ability cancel ride without penalty report issues Lyft.

I like along middle seats rule.  99% cases unvaccinated. Vaccines end game - point you’re waiting stragglers.   i’m starting feel angry countries officially approved ivermectin covid treatment thanks i-io-ic study I'm pretty sure full FDA approval use vaccine adults due September. change masks effective not.  Requiring full vaccination college would probably go long way alone Take CDC then. Even original strain, 95% effective means 5% effective. pretty easy find information vaccines less effective delta.

That's even biggest problem, though. biggest problem know last 30% unvaxxed first 30% take masks. wear condom day? we’ll see. Well, let's say California implements it. going voluntary businesses, otherwise create huge mess, politically legally. California also makes really easy sue business illegitimately deny equal treatment, happens someone state access system (maybe can't afford smartphone computer) gets denied equal treatment business. That's prime case civil rights lawsuit Unruh.

But problematic, businesses actually going voluntarily comply? Stationing worker door enforce passport costs money likely decrease business increase liability injuries civil rights violations, would imagine participate. all, bad mask police was, relatively easy see someone wearing mask. whole issue help every 90 year old lady figure pull passport computer-phone-thingy.

I think vaccine passports use California, going schools employers stuff like that. Nobody going checking papers door Safeway.   study able prove link reduced severe Covid outcomes. I’m saying it’s bad idea take vitamin supplement, evidence simply there. u think he's gonna watch shit? come on, dog  Delta changed game little regard According bloomberg vaccine tracker, Vermont Massachusetts 70% total population given 1+ dose.  figured 70-80% would vax. decided vaccine makes look like transgender ANTI-FA member. Maybe enough die change. know thats dark, state things. vaccinated people _&lt;insert country ? many drugs designed serve certain purpose later found alternative benefits. many people Reddit saying wearing mask vaccinated virtue signalling, great news! Moderna 

So far it’s 2/7 people, wife I. would spent time around would received largest viral load. boat buddy. Fully vaccinated since April, started showing signs Sunday, tested Wednesday: positive. Fucking blows man. feel terrible. Yeah royal carnival resorted financially penalizing idiots royal basically made cruises miserable anybody isn’t vaccinated. want moron pay sit room entire cruise spending hundreds extra dollars insurances pcr tests guess that’s choice 😂

And honestly lady making stupid TikTok great ad Royal Caribbean lol. antivaxxer loons boycott everyone else safely go vacation. Wasn’t another said makes lungs magnetized?  means gonna bash racists heads cold aluminum cylinder Go get vaccinated people Pretty sure point credibility undermined general...  data Pfizer 3-week interval. 64% efficacy certainly possible, though seems unlikely. 

The issue released details. could easily vaccinated adults getting infected half rate unvaccinated kids.      Question: mean people wear masks clubs live music shows dance floors? Seeing social distancing requirement restored, yet, make whole bunch sweaty people tight quarters gasping air. Double-vaxxed, reinfected, ICU 40? 

That's petrifying. Jesus.  Keep releasing boosters, allow kids get vaccinated let Darwinism run course? curiosity, vaccine have, friends get sick too? estimates put mRNA vaccine efficacy 80% delta, statistically none tested positive (assuming they're vaccinated too). cruise lines aren’t stupid, outbreak would finish entirely businesses heavy handed path survival.

The cruise lines chosen bypass law making life board miserable unvaccinated people also making pay hundreds dollars extra health evacuation insurance. They’re also testing board, etc. want pay money allowed half ship restaurants you’re sea that’s choice guess. need vaccinate world though. Delta originated India. next variant coming from? places low vax rates fault own. not? What's obstacle state level state like, say, California Massachussetts? Meh what's extra billion top trillions we're already printing --- used nonsense anyway. Yeah - keep testing till get positive. Dude! That’s I’m saying! Spot fucking on. plus side, think month two ago declared county herd immunity, likely there's unvaccinated people cause outbreak.

You really need convince everyone get vaccinated. think estimates 4 5 people achieve herd immunity.     don’t think anyone pulled wearing mask car. Yup. That's dangerous misinformation government kept us safe. Could imagine 5% death rate? think single thing would changed ""Gods wish"" people would still singing tune would trust grandmother hang someone conditions?  Archive link: wear mine everywhere. agree, majority people see wearing masks Asian African Americans. wonder why. Bring back last guy said masks useless.  mean thats never let people control life. becomes convenient put collar around neck. happens every time government group becomes powerful, pretty much without fail. Stop voting give people power you. 1000 new cases 99% unvaccinated people. God hate planet.   person non sarcastically saying much love government policies Isreal, suggesting move somewhere believe heartily? people aren’t comfortable getting vax hasn’t circulation years. I’m vaxxed support vaccination speculation vaccine isn’t unwarranted due government treats people  Probably help prevent flu hospitalizations. Why, wearing mask bother you?  no. get vaccinated. I’m taking melatonin makes zombie morning vaccines don’t work? honestly think vaccine passports, part, going realistic, least US. Countries centralized homogenous government may find effective. Exactly lol disgusting people Luckily live top 5 state vaccinations everyone know 30 work vaccinated. 

I wear mask shopping anything anymore. worked worked hard year get back normal I'm ok taking small risk indoors second care end sick un vaccinated. feel bad doctors treating idiots  That's meant. meant antivaxxers ruining progress far allowed masks come off. someone exposed virus night before, highly unlikely would contagious next day. said, tests perfect. Holy, I'm qualified review medical journals, seems really insane. Wtf wrong people    vaccine passports would help, maybe - prove they’ve vaxed return school- hang spent money time raffles giveways trying urge skeptical people get vaccinated pull bullshit 2 weeks later lmao Yes. blocks spike proteins. much mutation try get cells blocked. French *always* protesting. Vaccine passports really simple thing implement US. Like, good idea theory. practice, might difficult implement effectively.  Quick bit trivia - suffer serious illness, generally let immigrate unless family-based. Evil.... ever thought, maybe you’re wrong side things? assume you’re similar education level, field related this. Maybe they’re interpreting data, weighing odds, coming different conclusion living lives way want. Unless ""religious medical exemption"" see state CA CA idiotic mind going fuel antivax people, spring board lunatics like mom's boyfriend people fence may never get it.

I honestly see side. vaccine...and yet still mandates ect...what's point. We're going 5 years around long long time. want risk death serious side effects...that them. sympathy now.

Now variant comes 10% mortality rate...yes I'll change mind rate...who knows bad mutate odd comment. Ok that’s fair hear agree... wish mask mandates lifted children 12 get vaccinated. Many families sitting sidelines waiting, stuck situation parents vaccinated kids cannot yet. Angeleno too. definitely got shot ASAP mask mandate lifted, people wore masks indoors except certain demographic demographic definitely wasn’t vaccinated either. vaccinated people saw walking around maskless basically said, “aww hell no.” Move one places. carry vaccine passport. Success! anybody 12 susceptible negative side effects flu COVID. Well, people rational, they're approving ""dangerous vaccine."" they're temporarily authorizing vaccine whose danger sufficiently known potential danger vaccine likely much less potential danger virus.

So someone relatively confident they're likely contract virus, might want wait vaccines go proper approvals. course, plenty people hesitant take vaccine may particularly rational knowledgeable. surprisingly, people likely vaccine white-collar, non-Hispanic whites Asians. working class, poor, blacks, Hispanics much likely vaccinated. lot different reasons that. started job worker qualified lol gonna funny whole country goes back mask inside problem can't tell who's vaxded who's not.

And yes matters, even youre vaxxed. want stress test vaccination sitting indoor room full unvaccinated, unmasked people? sure fuck don't.

Vaccine passports now. need idea whether people around us indoor settings vaxxed exercise discretion see fit! Go COVID testing first COVID testing  mention, they're slow address viral talking points social media. ""vaccine causes female sterility"" myth still rampant.  Sydney actually children anti vaxxers want vaccine. Imagine 17 start high school person parents refuse let get vaccinated even though personally trust science must infuriating. Prof. Whitty go around tabard tricorne hat. Dr Murphy get naval uniform? No, fine.  man, fuck I'm fully vaccinated. I'm wearing mask unless cop store owners tells to. unvaccinated people deal passports masks, people right thing punished. Same! used get sick 3-5/year please shops aren’t shut … essential defined

Surprised pikachu face Same...my last cold/flu...well, technically acute respiratory infection caused pneumonia...was flu known coronavirus late December 2019. make 2021 without another bug I'll happy clam saltwater jam. couple days likely reach pretty big inflection point people back getting antibodies ""old fashioned"" way vaccines. unvaccinated much less likely test undercounts likely gone significantly since up-to-date CDC estimate 3-4X. 

6-7X undercount 40K cases/day means ~240-280K infection-induced antibodies per day (ignoring re-infection infections vaccinated people).  care enough vote, care enough vaccinate, care charge phone, twerk, eat hot chip lie.   average person gets 2 colds per year, flu every 10 years....who cares. Everyone gets sick sometimes. would think would obvious course action honestly, even Redditors realize. see comments subs like r/Virology someone reply question make seem REALLY know talking even add references, totally corrected verified professionals obviously astounded ignorance aforementioned commenter. 


What hate people go entire paragraph pretending know talking end like ""but that's heard"" ""at least think that's works"". Like please try spread information unless coming actual source. people going miss tiny disclaimer end. Saw lot people trying make something viruses mutate sub.  Studies shown viral load lower among infected mRNA vaccine infected without. seen similar studies regards Johnson Johnson vaccines, however. inferences made Johnson Johnson's vaccine effect viral load information mRNA vaccines effect viral load? Thanks. Asians blamed, usual, right thing bc benefit ""white privilege "" ""white adjacent."" -_- identity politics predictable. cold since 2019 still going strong, baby! earliest book Pfizer vaccine medical worker two months due supply issues  I'm going go Science Like said, recent jump vaccinations might evidence working. could even turn counter active protests exploring see heat online. highly doubt going end well giving amplifier voice anti vaxers really matter long none restrictions needed? Masking half intrusive things like capacity limits, curfews, gathering restrictions. Delta 18 months old. trick say ""recover"" mean ""not die"" ""not long term quality life reducing symptoms?""

I'm trying find sources quality life reducing stuff vaccine I'm finding anything - sources?  No, virus travel. risk tens millions local mouthbreathers swamped risk billions unvaxxed people globally. you’ve willingly chosen host carrier? Everything happened March 2020 shown honor system work, honor system essentially way avoiding responsibility throwing hands air. goal get people get vaccinated help  live San Bernardino County number 2 hospitalizations state. zip code 52% ADULTS gotten least one dose. around 36% whole population fully vaccinated. Disappointing. hope grocery store shop at, wearing masks. Brit asking need reason pomp circumstance? never. share study? 

I'm legit interested numbers issue. degree vaccination reduce viral shedding. shots, ignore blatant disregard people right thing. summary: dont protect *yourself*, cut society

everyone chance vaccinate now, everyone responsible much parent is. exactly entitled make medical decisions children. take court it, judge likely tell gtfo. police definitely stop you. CPS stop you. 

What kids think? want vaccinated, that’s even better. authority figure looking kids want vaccine, parent wants let going side parent, sure.  could increase vaccination... end?

Hopefully children vaccinated.  likelihood false negative PCR 1-2 days symptoms?

I fever (100) nothing else 3 days tested negative yesterday morning. Hoping means COVID nurse said could test negative early on. true I'm showing symptoms?

I'm vaccinated also careful daughter 3 unvaccinated. worst we've done went outdoor aquarium realize crowded would be. masks us wear one (never went anywhere near folks need). loved regret weave people times.

We also sat outdoors restaurant once. server mask.

That's literally it. go grocery shopping early morning week wear mask that, wear one work anytime go somewhere. course, one else anymore suppose able catch anything.

What's likelihood COVID false negative? hell also could getting beat mask attempts sanitize hands guess.

It's bit strange sickness really fever achiness (related fever think). sinus pressure stuffiness anything. respiratory issues. Nothing else wrong fever.

I hate pandemic. want daughter able vaccinated. :( fact many pharmacists nurses refuse take Covid seriously...it's incredibly disturbing. Boomers mostest get mostest silver platter 

Cannot relate problems younger gens end??? virus spreading mainly among unvaccinated. everyone wear masks again. doesn’t work bring back capacity limits. doesn’t work shut bars restaurants again. still doesn’t work what? Another full lockdown? 

When people right thing get lives back? I’m sorry people still getting sick every opportunity right thing can’t bothered. *Pfizer said statement NBC News anticipates results clinical trials kids ages 5 11 sometime September, could apply emergency use authorization.

You Texas? big part I'd really like get COVID even post vaccination. longer go without getting better available treatment gets event I'm someone unlucky enough bad case. countries can't reopen kind vaccine coverage, never reopen

Never = October year children vaccines approved. Widespread constant testing paired masks remains path pandemic. Vaccines make things way easier asking much expect vaccines single handidly end pandemic Exactly. I'm sick ""but science says."" No, people caved bunch whiners. Period point blank everyone said otherwise like...told ya 🤷🏻‍♀️ Dang, that's long time fever! Thanks sharing glad feeling better! tell people get arses get goddamn shots formal polite manner. stg people claim want return normal want jackshit it. Sooner reach 80-90% fully vaccd, sooner start herd immunity, sooner end shitshow. question vaccine effectiveness measured. specific exposure experiments get effectiveness numbers, right? measure many people test positive/have severe illness getting vaccinated get numbers protecting infection/protecting severe disease?

I'm wondering real vaccine efficacy different originally stated due environmental circumstance. Say initial study done vaccinated individuals living largely unvaccinated population masking mandates variants &amp; b wild. would different vaccine effectiveness measured environment say mandates, 50% vaccination rate, variants a, b, c, &amp; wild, right? 

I'm curious might see breakthrough cases change noted efficacy vaccine mandates removed. ideal situation would 100% vaccination rate, many states US still ways go even reach 70%.

Still, bottom line, get vaccine already done so. danger?

It’s public safety issue, issue individual preference. Vaccinate don’t; that’s individual preference. don’t demand individual preference valid excuse ignore ***public*** health safety. online see people freaking out.

That's mostly people never wearing masks first place take offense idea vaccinated people still wear masks indoor and/or crowded places long lot COVID community. much overrepresented Reddit, sub particular. want treated cocaine!! Let’s spread good misinformation. Like “showering using deodorant increases size penis.” Let’s good misinformation anything.  Absolutely not… mask mandates permanent, refuse vaccine “boosters”, point getting booster. Fauci mvp Yet republicans encourage dumb sick ahhh bankrupt …. sick. really hoping picture shadow box dads it... Absolutely, agree. feel like conservatives make majority antivax community, alternative health probably make smaller portion. opinion based personal observations people around me. isn’t entirely it’s also people issues get it’ll bad them.   seems little evolutionary pressure COVID get less deadly long incubation period. person pre-symptomatic 7-14 days spreading it, matter much virus kills afterward.

This meant alarmist, see virus suddenly disappearing quite easily. I'm sad happy come I'm also slightest bit surprised anyone thought otherwise burying head sand. vaccines amazing, basically magic generational breakthrough medicine. going totally end everything without much higher uptake, vaccinated people still vulnerable long community spread remains high. prematurely ditching masks kept community spread high. Vaccines plus NPIs get COVID, one other. Thank saying this. …at significantly reduced viral load. Floridian here, send help. fact rely honor system people's sense decency make CDC guidance masking unvaccinated work patently absurd.

As idiots want vaccine going continue voluntarily masking. Oh same, people know small circle fine masks. hell lot people Reddit lol. community spread rates low nurse work work COVID patients part daily duties? Yes (assuming cancer patient immuno-compromised always case). risk di minimus. 

If community spread high? There's good argument made re-assign nurses lower-risk patients.

Just clear, I'm insanely pro-vax. idea nurse healthcare professional practicing 25 years suddenly let go bona fide medical contraindication vaccines ridiculous. risk-based approach taken given current community circumstances patient vulnerability. 

As extreme example, doctor can't measles vaccine lose license? No, course not. Measles less eradicated domestically (in US) rare imported cases. Yes   Depends time day. two camps, *not* tolerate challenge worldview. So, humans. love there, really want move. largely

Yes, largely, entirely. important distinction. we're seeing unvaccinated people's entitlement stupidity catching them. They've months right thing, everyone go back? Must feel like slap face live especially since really hyped June 15 lifting restrictions. vaccinated, safe. Yah one traveling right? actual strains haven’t come California? 🙄 liberal county Maryland made announcement week ago longer require masks children regardless vaccination status removing distancing etc.  going complete shit show come September. fault won’t get vaccine Exactly. fuel antivaxxers also goes misinformation sub doubting efficacy vaccines. Moderna vaccine cases causing guillain-barre syndrome like J &amp; J vaccine?  road hell paved good intentions wear masks large outbreaks. LA county saying vaccines work effective anymore? Embarrassing. It’s psychological. People don’t want put masks back acknowledge reality it’s ongoing global pandemic evolving dangers outside control. especially true America, government failed people obviously badly, businesses arbitrarily dictate much people’s lives, including exposure COVID. Believe god Fauci, never doubt, never question. without cost economy.

I think many people expect LA county stop masks. restrictions costs economy worries people. certainly hope so! know area one worst vaccination rates San Diego, also masking everything closed back Winter. people aren’t getting vaccinated that’s slowed worrying degree. know lot people don’t want to, it’s super frustrating. Maybe less generation's Youtube Geocities?   /r/PublicFreakout get avalanche fresh content upcoming weeks I’m scared boys hoping county least offer option online classes till vaccines available. youngest intellectual disabilities puts second highest risk group elderly covid related complications. honestly thinking option keep safe home school year. annoying thing is, excellent data vaccines affect fertility, well promoted people know exists.

""TL;DR: **Yes people phase 3 trial got pregnant vaccination. difference rates pregnancy vaccine placebo groups**. one vaccine group trouble pregnancy course study. also tested female rats find problems, either fertility pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report give nice summary like this, report 23 people became pregnant trial. report 2 adverse events related pregnancy, placebo group.

Both companies say continue monitor pregnant people. general, know reason vaccine would affect fertility. believe ever before. mRNA technology new-ish, radically different would reason believe fertility would affected. hand, growing evidence covid-19 affect fertility.""

/r/COVID19/comments/kcy2e0/comment/ggb3d65

We also large studies people pregnant got vaccine, found vaccines safe. ( 35,700 vaccinated pregnant women, rate complications normal rate complications unvaccinated pregnancies.)

We also data males vaccine decrease sperm count cause issues. It’s 100% political want people wear thing every day show don’t like Donald Trump majority community vaccinated (including myself) going willing comply mandate. following CDC guidelines.. sure it’s laziness apathy. 

Plus states countries young people near back list. friends Europe weren’t able vaccinated week ago young (20s). 

In US course opened months ago mostly, still. There’s lot apathy told you’re young don’t need freak you’re almost certainly going fine. mentality persisted some. information good useful, press release room one stat would want know percent hospitalized patients fully vaccinated. think “195/all vaccinated” particularly useful don’t really know exposure rates. useful info would demographics.

I family member break case (fully vaxxed still got sick) went hospital, 90 years old folks bit cautious right time go hospital is. recovered great though!  No. Yes, get vaccinated, efficacy 90% anymore vaccine doesn’t make invincible. 

Vaccines still ~96% effective preventing hospitalization 90% effective preventing *symptomatic disease*. 

Once kids get vaccinated Fall, either effectively mandate vaccine (through vaccine passports) drop mask mandates altogether.

I care one iota might spread disease someone chosen get vaccinated.

(To preempt you, care people *cannot* get vaccinated, think mandate vaccine can.)

I also think absolutely wrong shutdown restaurants businesses, ruining many livelihoods, protect people refusing help themselves. glad see happen. increasingly convinced least half humankind functionally insane. People still think vaccinated can’t spread disease can’t get sick

It's ""can't,"" *probably* won't, that's *still* true.  Oh yeah, get food go too. survive eating dinner styrofoam container youre making minimum wage service staff risk lives convenience? 🥲 hope you’ll ok don’t link paper, believe documented case infection Isreael vaccinated person vaccinated youth graduation event within last weeks. least one vaccinated early, January. Stop acting like masks ruin lives. opposite ffs  God, too! it’ll spread til deadly variant wipes massive chunk humanity. what? “We didn’t know.” How’s working disasters. Australia decently large population give shit border ever reopened? definitely people US would fine that. realize delta variant basically impossível reach herd immunity? defend? it’s joined up. can’t get vaccination present states get record combined.

The US missed trick really come system like EU UK rolled out. Israeli data plastered sub week go guess. said 40% vaccinated spread covid 60% efficacy. just… obviously true.   I'm glad someone said it. complete overreaction help anything doesn’t answer question. Since people won’t actually get vaccinated, else happen?  We. Don’t. thick headed ones get brains get vaccinated this. honestly point vaccinated people shun them. Ban businesses. Whatever takes. Hell, need use scarlet letter. gotcha moment basically admitted ""wearing stupid mask"". better yet, everyone go get shot get merry go round. concern isn’t me, it’s kids young get vaccinated yet. longer goes likely variant finds way around vaccine we’re back square one. mean, Ivermectin designed kill parasites body, treat viruses. fact many people, including bright scientists, tried hype medicine sort miracle cure beyond comprehension. Well wrong. Masks help slow spread.  Yeah, reality suck. 

But many people basically crying world way wish was. Sorry, wishing different make so. Oh boy, going cause lot fights markets can’t wait stand back watch shouting “world star” glad live there!  Lmao literally. Asking people put mask front face like asking sacrifice first born child. Last winter worse delta ever be. vaccines hinder transmission significantly vulnerable likely vaccinated. original take though, wasn’t it? 

Many people believed kind intentionally released/engineered virus. 

It may lab, definitely wasn’t engineered current understanding. China certainly isn’t going intentionally release pandemic, least country epicenter. 

Lab release definitely possible, were, would accident likely. doesn’t preclude cover similar course. would want internationally known?

I think lot people don’t want give credence idea though, lot people believed lab theory political reasons rather scientific reasons. Sorry answered 500 times, I’m curious timeline clear now. 
When current vaccines US aim seek full FDA approval? 
I understand huge process, I’m gonna lie…just feeling super eager see anti-vaxxers able use excuse say stupid things like, “iT’s fUlLy FDA aPpRoVeD GuInEa PiGs!!”  Mandatory vaccines possible FDA approval, know what's taking long.  live inside rest life man won’t, that’s thing.  also know people seriously ill and/or died. difference weren’t vaccinated. data data.  mean amount deaths non vaxxed people? almost like vaccines money grab something punishment. infection control. public safety measure.

It'sike saying speed limits punishment good drivers. No, cases trials, Pfizer too, higher normal rates GBS. correlation vaccine.

I concerned J&amp;J either.   But… vaccines *do* protect infection? Imperfectly, course, even Delta, studies ranged 63%-88% relative protection infection, including asymptomatic? 

We’re simply going live state restrictions, masking, distancing, etc. definitely fully vaccinated aren’t 100% protected catching probably be, again, basically cold/mild flu. CDC mostly concerned domestic ramifications (at least politically), extremely beholden political song dance bend knee whichever country they’re operating in. 

Neither organization really exists point finger anyone “fault”. They’re (in theory least) political organizations lay blame someone’s feet. 

And tries it’s best piss country (to fault, obviously). Well France like ""get vaccine else never go cafe again"" motivated bunch people. enforce whatever America's version cafe lmao  Forever? read thought FOREVER?! pandemic last forever obvious reasons. herd immunity, future boosters, mutations virus eventually common mild enough issue. bird flu pandemic 20s lasted 2-3 years. ya… fOreVeRrRrR. Get outta sandlot ass  punishment.

They another solution - require vaccine passports - instead decided coddle anti-vaxxers punish responsible people instead. proven vaccine protects variant??? going much point people likely wearing masks following restrictions already vaccinated.  Well gives really good excuse go LA guess lol

Like get it, tell vaccinated people followed rules take step back unvaccinated people suck slap face.  best numbers vaccine protection severe cases really good - like 95% effective good. still means 20 unvaccinated people would position, 1 vaccinated person would. 
 
And see real world. example currently San Francisco Marin counties, hospitalizations covid 9 unvaxxed / 2 vaxxed SF 13 unvaxxed / 2 vaxxed Marin. 
  
 
Those kind numbers expect places high vaccination rates according efficacy percentages. shows vaccines really helpful, severe breakthrough cases super ""rare."" governor sucks putting politics children's lives. always known going happen - I’d astonished CDC didn’t factor decision longer requiring masks. don’t understand burden responsibility falls rest society.
  
This feels like case one kid acts class teacher holds whole class recess. Healthcare isn’t overwhelmed, I’d wager it’s near impossible become overwhelmed level population immunity. pay?
  
If someone jumps front car I’m freeway, reason ban driving  misspelled AI vaccination drones. Nope what?

I'm saying take anecdotal stories sub are: anecdotal.

I would love see medical data shows statistics fully vaxxed people catching breakthrough infection *and* spreading someone else. Book smarts ain’t everything.  countries it. Israel while. France starting weeks (and getting huge rush people signing vaccinations it!). really really wish available school started. Exactly!! Im one work still masking! Everyone ""vaccinated."" meetings everyone unmasked know certain 75% vaxxed one checking/verifying. Utter bs. I'm ""going get used it"" I'm going peacefully nonviolently resist. Enough enough. I'm vaccinated. problem stay home. really. Hospitalization risk still reduced factor ~20 compared unvaccinated.  risk covid, divided 20, right par risk many things already tolerate. I've stayed masked regardless. moment state said ""If fully vaccinated need wear mask,"" 95% people stopped wearing masks area 45% vaccinated. might actually watched that. It’s based Israel data showing vaccine 60 something percent effective delta. Additionally, it’s 60% effective SYMPTOMATIC infection, potentially even vaccinated people spread asymptomatically can’t it’s bullshit would great… also wish Novavax could hurry provide another doesn’t-need-cold-storage option places Pfizer/Moderna might harder ship store… close quarter long include hospital workers directly healthcare (janitors, cafeteria workers, etc).  Easter actually Oh wow, look everybody! u/piratecaptain12 plan! plan! Well thank lord plan now. Everything point random chaotic reactions cohesive agenda steps action. expect take complete control everything enact plan? soon? I’m excited! interesting, thanks! Hope feeling better! Restrictions ending countires starting talk dates allowing tourists. trending learn live direction.  Jesus folks… get vaccinated. even offer come impregnate beforehand that’s hangup. Tax incentives vaxed. pay dividends, I've since January Actually it’s happened multiple times various countries lol Darwin drivers seat now.  Natural selection.  Still human beings. Mostly humans lied people put trust in. critical stance falling rhetoric, they're still human beings. everyone vaccinated dug in. lazy see reason it.

With proper incentives/restrictions, many would get vaccinated. Look France vaccine-shy French suddenly rushing get jabbed  government’s decision allow fully vaccinated enter restaurants, bars, trains spaces caused spike inoculations  Warned anti-vaxxer colleague, several months ago, happen. Europe it, too. 
He still ranting chips Bill Gates sperm. Well, mistake. Except everyone who's dying got decide whether got vaccine - may still hospital prior wide availability vaccine, might gotten sick scheduled vaccine appointment, may locations availability hard get to, may people weren't/still elligible vaccine. even worse, people (to fair, many), vaccinated caught breakthrough case (so yes, still sort risk death risk increasing speak thanks variants created spread unvaccinated people). 

You feel sorry people choose get vaccine ended getting COVID, advocating everyone get vaccine care others do, like replied above, unvaccinated have, easier virus mutate spread, become vaccine resistant, causing vaccine useless. It’s “targeting UK” it’s article UK-based newspaper, lol, wouldn’t cover news home country France put vaccine mandate access general life things appointments went two million people past 48 hours. works.  guess counties lowest risk ironically also ones lowest vaccination rate.

The counties listed mostly black belt counties- poorest, least educated, rural areas state already one poorest, least educated, rural country.

Which leads believe reason aren’t high risk remote there’s much option transmission, infected people aren’t even going hospital, little testing done counties.   want know you’re alone. Wearing mask seriously big deal reality. mentally FEELS like big deal huge step backwards. makes distrust public officials health organizations. don’t expect perfection either, don’t understand end game this. Knee-jerk reactions anxiety-producing. people really expect world zero Covid? interesting timeline.  

There murders  
The flu kills  
Car accidents  
murders+suicides, covid big deal  
Ok, bad flu (in 2 months) killed many people flu worldwide entire year.  
World wars... stuck age-based groups long time, younger people (who tend socialize lot younger people) last line… fueled spread. got unlucky Delta, transmissible unvaccinated transmissible half-vaccinated variants. Waiting people get second doses would wise — least keeping masks on, reopening, vaccines actually kick fully. got vaccinated Covid right now. new strain seems cause ton breakthrough cases. 70% vaccinated.. scientists approve easing restrictions?  dad grandfather still wear seatbelt protest. 2021. makes sense- understand American English 'people' people May right time release masks, *then is?*

I think kept masks whole summer made announcement fall, would actually even worse, people unmasking winter virus, like many, seasonal. That's also mention many people would kick bucket outright refuse cooperate, slowing vaccination could result lack impetus.

And keep masks seasons, ideally would protective, also would least obedience, case even less people would care since long time. mask mandates even close living life like normal groups fully vaccinated partially vaccinated together though. saying it’s something concerned, keeping close eye it, understanding two shots fully needed protection one shot ain’t really going cut it. Grouping partially vaccinated fully vaccinated together doesn’t paint whole picture would guess. ""We analyzed data Household Transmission Evaluation Dataset

How many residents households tested asymptomatic infection? Sucks kids 12 currently killing 250 people per day, works 90k per year. That's summer, flu deaths normally single digits per day. data now. 

heres source quick search: talking points filter people political, I've seen Pandemic started, black white whatever..  mental health country tanked. Drug overdoses rose significantly, along youth depression suicides. I'm early twenties social life shot... I'm extrovert nature, imagine fun been.

I feel though. honestly feel like part eroded broke this. honestly can't take anymore. I'm tired told still make sacrifices even full vaccination. added federal public health officials concerned ""we  
going continue see preventable cases, hospitalizations and, sadly, deaths among unvaccinated.""

If immunodeficiency another valid medical reason getting vaccined, find nothing terribly sad it. like warned. incorrect mask advice given early ""strategic"" avoid run N95 masks health care workers could get them. words, Surgeon General CDC lied protect supply masks. gave fuel deniers skeptics true, officials knew true. 

Government agencies always political, including ones guide policy using ""science"". simply can't trust using pure scientific principles (lots examples, including lies vaping and, past, marijuana). I’ve bern wearing mask indoors since started. get downvoted every time say this, but: wearing mask big deal, it’s huge sacrifice make. 


Wear one don’t, know actions effect others. you’re really willing put piece fabric face protect people, it. pandemic isn’t going infections stop spreading, therefore mutating. Something like 35-40% Americans obese. think mask quarantine requirements support doomsday scenario Remove immunity vaccine manufacturers sued would go long way. think right. read news, maybe could answer Africa.

Black people long history distrust CDC government whole obvious reasons.  ""Thems charts made bowl-shit! best friend works hospital said they't even got damn covid section. sayin empty! Also look label vaccines putting people ingredients things ain't even heard of!"" told pandemic [It’s understand saying. speak everyone obviously, say ""people"" mean people. assume that's everyone means, add ""some"", maybe accurate.  Yes trying educate encourage gets far (50% seems)and virus ain’t gonna politely stop spreading mutating hold classes gently nurture people. Atta boy!! (Or girl) Party Small Government, way.

edit: also Party National Security, making sure virus china kills maximum amount US citizens. . Almost half country still unvaccinated. Delta incredibly efficient spreading, longer lockdowns. Could get numbers last round, really ~20% caught it. round 2 truly pandemic unvaccinated.  It’s really covid I’m freaked about. know it’s wayyy better circumstances last year, variant not. I’m worried local governments unnecessarily adding restrictions again. LA county literally said two days ago covid patients unvaxxed, yet add guidelines them? Ugh it’s frustrating. ever seen ""no shirt, shoes, service"" sign? thing. Check vaccination cards. Make lives miserable refuse service.

Here alternative.....we miserable go lockdown again. It’s nuanced that. Everybody *can*, yes, everybody will. Even unvaccinated people, everybody infected necessarily transmit it, variety reasons. isn’t enough data make concrete quantifications transmission post-vaccine, it’s unreasonable infer vaccination significantly reduces transmission, even doesn’t make zero. stop thinking things terms simplistic, broadly applying absolutes. one short analysis last month, suggesting transmission rate 40%-50% lower vaccinated households — cases, “vaccinated” households one dose. It’s likely, based everything know far vaccines, second dose reduces risk transmission even that. definitive analysis? No. data needed. present preponderance evidence points likelihood transmission post-vaccine nonzero, also likely quite small. 

And importantly, transmission within majority-vaccinated population inevitable COVID becomes endemic disease people get vaccinated overall; also, mere infection becomes less important indicator time. still threat willfully unvaccinated, they’ve made decision assumed risk volition, I’m sure solution there. Frankly, agree also think there's harm children continue wear masks school vaccination rates increase. problem systematic, individuals. Humans inherently prone mistakes think alleviate consequences mistakes. put blame individuals using seatbelts solution.

Here things countries do.

Public transportation reduces amount traffic also traffic fatalities. Reducing traffic also reduces pollution reduces lung heart diseases (nanoparticles, also stress noise). Also environment likes it.

Walking cycling promoted. reduces cars roads too. also increases amount physical activity reduces deaths due heart disease cancers.

Side effects health environment two points could important saving lives actually preventing accidents.

Distinction made types roads. streets low speed high amount intersections, roads low amount intersections higher speed (even highways), cycling paths etc. Americas big problem called ""stroads"" high speed roads high amount intersections. lot accidents happen right here, relatively high speed they're serious.

Cities planned badly forcing people drive long distances get something need. nothing available walking distance people drive leads accidents.

You find videos stroads problems American urban planning e.g. YouTube.

So, fundamentally city design problem easy solve. cost fix things high might better let people die. hope use seatbelts die - message since 60s something people know better don't. showing steady decline cases U.S. back almost 30% increase daily. Honestly told get covid booster every 6 months, would say “fine big deal.” It’s total nothing burger. state force either private company publicly traded company *not* require vaccination? seems like infringes company policies. isn’t worker’s rights issue.

If don’t want make state decision, fine—but don’t also take decision away independent companies too. blow back state-funded jobs.   think leaving significant group there... homeschooled kids whole thing. weeks ago neighborhood walk, stopped talk father daughter front lawn. father separate adult conversation husband, daughter telling kids she’s sick days doesn’t know why. parents took away masks wouldn’t let wear one last week school.

I said need go home get started dinner told good night. wasn’t socialize second longer. vaccine mandated, masks needed. 

Note different general population, vaccines mandated. True, me, every person forced get vaccine, LA County put mask mandate back on. Yes. WSJ opinion piece morning talked 99% people hospitals bc Covid unvaccinated. round 2 truly becoming pandemic unvaccinated.

Link article. surprise all, I'd expect deaths stay way last wave. Maybe 25-35% most. Unfortunately there's nothing get people vaccinated. They're dug there's turning back them. hope virus mutate point vaccines become less effective. maddening people extending pandemic.   actually enforce mask mandate unvaccinated people?

Chill dude. Lockdown unlikely, expect mask mandates, including places work.   There's never good time visit LA, really.  Decoupling hinging case counts needs happen ASAP really started months ago. saying somebody shouldn’t keeping track, vaccinated people really doesn’t matter. Imagine news flu case count sidebar every day. Would ludicrous, we’re approaching level covid now. livid put lightly lmao shit non-vaccine alternative. prevents catching something called vaccine. 

Do want know anything helps get house called door? 

All questions dumb af.  bet raising insurance premiums dramatically unvaccinated dimwits would effective. irrational fears doomsday scenario justification forcing people something want do.

Policy 100% fact science driven respect COVID-19 policies.  Hopefully everyone California vaccinated refuses wear masks. need pushback this. Unvaccinated people can't drag people right thing got shot. unvaccinated want kill COVID, them. Rest peace. Tell God said hi. honestly scared shitless U.S. going go back lockdown now. Los Angeles bringing back mask mandates freaking fuck out. seriously worried that, Los Angeles severely overreacting? You’re showing “respect” “empathy” forcing employees enforce mandate legally required enforce. That’s disrespect. puts zero pressure officials made decision, pressure people say. got pregnant days getting second moderna shot. 13 weeks I’m relieved worry (as much) getting covid pregnant, hopefully passing antibodies baby. Covid pregnant extra bad, I’m glad aren’t risking it. 20's 30's near peak physical condition also goes long way much milder fights disease. Go protest outside doors politicians require full vaxxing leave house 12 something upset. *vaccines* what's going save us. 1) vaccianted people get infected spread it. around 75% efficacy infections, means every 4 unvaccinated people would infected, 1 vaccinated person would. 

2) easier enforce everybody rather selectively unvaccinated people. 

3) overall rules like time. seatbelts required everybody, bad drivers. Lie age? health passports virtually useless anyway, vaccinated people getting infected could potentially infect others. say wasn’t? said willingly unvaccinated adults LA, comprise 99.9% hospitalizations. Insurance companies could end simply covering medical bills unvaccinated people. Okay, know I’ve saying US never shut again, fuck it: **We need shut again.** gotta stop damn variant, way shut states low vaccination rates moderate rate. Anti-Vaxxers it, screw them.

Punish unvaccinated. Well mandate better request. We’ll see goes, course, given information right correct move.  many doctors work politifact? took 18 months Exactly 1918 flu turned regular flu. Covid another bad cold/flu Hang on, cowboy - children threatened it. little people need chance vaccine first - talk letting chips fall may. That's reason mandated everyone. makes enforcement easier (i.e. ""masks required store"") Wait, pretend really bad anxiety bad reading comprehension. 5-11 sooner mid-winter?! Please say yes. Yep, see ending US summer 2022 so. No, necessarily. LA seeing increased levels spread, evidence vaccinated people transmit, general unwillingness among business impose kind masking control towards unvaccinated people. It’s blunt tool it’s best one we’ve got right now. 

Also, no, means civil rights violation. You’d surprised power public health common law. Except even less known then, people suggesting attempting smear China downplay threat. Even come lab, initial people right wrong reasons such, labeled crazy.  ***Gee wonder vaxx rates higher?***  Oy, nobody 12 get vaxxed yet.   Me, too. Agree. thing done masks sooner correctly (no nose, chin etc) might never even heard Delta already back normal vaccinations. literally feet draggers, whiners complainers contribute. nerve complain. Infuriating!! Please don’t harass employees don’t choice this. want put pressure, organize protest form nonviolent resistance. employees stores choice this. Good luck trying.  pandemic, people travel. law.  ages five people? vaccinated it, eventually stop too. actually original prediction last year, masks till spring 2022 less less people comply requirement dropped organically. reaching point sold idea even vaccinated extremely effective vaccine continue live exactly lived last 16 months. postmaster general doesn’t get issues uniform don’t think. Outrageous. I’d like remind anti-vaxxers crying “socialism” may force get vaccinated, extraordinarily expensive medical care they’ll receive become (or make others) ill funded us responsible getting vaccinated. 

The bill time intensive care unit ventilator coming society’s pocket higher insurance premiums. irresponsible “freedom loving” folks biggest consumers socialized health care. going difficult

NY's digital Excelsior pass, bypassed easily (you print qr code, many businesses check pass versus ID could use someone else's pass).

 Biggest loophole business use Excelsior must also accept paper CDC cards. get (if get covid shot CT NJ, able use NY Excelsior pass), paper cards easy people forge.

Basically, ship sailed. require federal program make effective (Biden administration it) states/counties keep good records take Excelsior Pass, paper vaccine cards must also accepted form proof, state said  want incentive vaccines make passport already. vaccinated people, pandemic essentially reduced bad flu season. government justify imposing restrictions fully vaxxed, justification. arguments fully vaxxed stay masked slim hypothetical risks rather realized risks. unvaxxed making numbers rise, need impose restrictions them. there's proof fully vaxxed significant risk/illness Delta (moreso flu season, imposed restrictions), can't impose restrictions people unecessarily.  disneyland, since orange county. kid goes school mine. 15 days stop spread! place children don’t wear masks (the adults though). zero social distancing children children adults would completely infeasible incredibly cruel attempt. check center see exact policy is. 

As far whether it’s safe leave care, it’s hard know delta it’s new, general children spread COVID less adults, symptoms. cases, it’s people getting outside center part (there one point teacher came work asymptomatic COVID though). children gotten zero issues. class I’m time one child infected know (out 14) completely fine. depends many cases live personal situation, kids guaranteed negative effects parents work seem worse possibility infection, least now, hence dozens children currently attending. can’t predict future.  Politicians fucked every step virus, sides. CDC WHO.

You can't say nobody wear mask rescind that. could required vaccine cards wear mask places could known actually vaxxed wearing mask not. Literally going right providing fuel anti-vaxxers. They're gonna think even vaccines work. understanding you’re vaccinated fine. Yeah, people might died anyway. Damn that’s mild case. Duck LA resident , I’m beyond bummed this. science policy? Safety, efficacy, biggest concern among unvaccinated. unlikely”

Isn’t basically saying “likely likely”? mean “possible likely”? players asymptomatic?  Honestly first agreed covid-zero approach, clearly worked Australia seeing less 1000 deaths whole pandemic. 

However think everybody (especially Victoria) fatigued expected vaccinated now. federal government completely messed vaccine rollout result around 9% population fully vaccinated. really option right get lives lockdowns Delta variant transmissible would see lot deaths / cases unvaccinated population.

The Victorian government known implementing lockdowns, however lockdown due New South Wales (Sydney) failing lockdown, caused removalists state bring virus us. 100 ish cases day yet premier refuses go strict lockdown like now, shops still open etc. curfew, travel 5km house, visitors etc. I'm hoping smash one 5 days show Sydney done. College educated well. gonna catch COVID vaccine.  anecdotal, quite friends LA got vaccine allow get back normal life.       doesn’t really change benefits places unvaccinated go along pretending vaccinated. Maybe changed things work, actually checked vaccination status. simply isn’t trustworthy member Biden’s regime. guy instills calm confidence every syllable. Scotland also vaccinations. areas much 96% eligible first dose.

It seems situation realatively stable Blackburn, Bolton Manchester first significant delta waves. Absurd. people aren’t vaccinated getting hospitalized. Quit punishing smart ones.  would awesome. would cover [sizeable people suffer fear needles. projection also great point. number people respond concerned getting control thinking must I'm afraid concern others vulnerable quite large. Yes significantly.

Would love back data. Perhaps find massive surge vaccinations people told ""if fully vaccinated mask"" (btw find it, one). also little even curb infections. virus large driven brief encounters grocery store sitting restaurant. driven private gatherings spending long time indoors eating, drinking, talking, dancing, yelling, etc. There’s real way enforce masks scenarios even wanted to. reason masks worked people avoiding types situations masking to…that’s going case now, making pretty much pointless theater. would wonderful sure, data article suggesting detectable change severity Alpha, less severity. 

Look chart proportion cases (so deaths appropriately adjusted case numbers) fatal UK. appears change recent months.  biggest fucking bullshit encourage everyone get flu vaccine every year, right?  worth effort multiple reasons. 

1) apply employers. 

2) say consequences government can't applied.

3) Even someone successfully argued prohibits consequences government, matter government interested mandate anyway.  Getting vaccine risk/benefit analysis. people gotten vaccinated care risks, way get vaccinated increase benefits so. move removes benefit great pay off! people amaze smh Get vaccinated shoudl fine. wear mask public/indoor places.  me, friend parents got 3 time (the 3rd worst one). know several people got least 2. long Covid straining already strained health care system?  Nah gotta blame previous president, case Trump. next election blame Biden. 50% increase among hospitalisations amongst infected general population? 

What baseline 50% increase, cases variants detected severe.   Ohh wait telling smart enough understand knowing vaccines work effective knowledge percentage many people side effects many died isnt enough come conclusion vaccine safe?? 

Ya stick others tell obviously can't think yourself. get businesses buy in. That's likely work places vaccination rates already high. allowing unvaccinated people maskless everywhere increasing vaccinations? Everyone get vaccine also got benefits already chance though? countries they're last group access. good person, hope feel well :) Eu tenho alguns parentes que já pegaram 3 vezes covid :| assume America read headline idiots. People getting vaccinated point basically impossible convince Same. live LA fully vaccinated continue follow higher power...CDC guidelines. time nonviolent peaceful resistance. Yes significantly. Getting vaccine risk/benefit analysis. people gotten vaccinated care risks, way get vaccinated increase benefits so. move removes benefits causing reduction vaccination rates.  Cannot believe LA county require masks regardless vaccination status. end goal now? Zero Covid? Vaccinations stop delta variant nearly well variants, cases, hospitalizations, deaths almost entirely among unvaccinated, numbers still low.

I cannot come reason would happen beyond LA county putting superficial facade ""look us, care people, err side caution always!"" 

The numbers lie. Vaccinated protected. inherent risk accept participating society; risk never zero strive zero. Canada. well CA almost taking masks October. go well. Youtube whatever hell name generation currently high school college is. making wait. revive economy safe way. Publicans fucked last while. Let get bit much needed revenue vaccinated. needs something similar. vaccine cards insufficient, could easily done something loads phone ID.

We still can, think California recently implemented digital vaccine database. exactly system France put in, would love know idiots bar, restaurant, store, park, gas station in.

I could imagine collective antivaxxer outrage suddenly barred favorite stores restaurants. /r/PublicFreakout would absolute field day. using well sourced information, auto mod I’m sure serves purpose, extremely annoying. unpopular opinion indeed. one know 50% efficacy CureVac vaccine, aproved yet (if ever) scary, know they're still getting lung scarring, organ damage long covid Iike many ""mild"" infections. one note, demanding big clinical trials proof pandemic criminal. see 1 side dyeing arm trial getting better significant numbers DOCTORS ( took Hippocratic oath) stop trial. I’m fucking infuriated. honestly INSANELY diligent masking up, seeing friends/family, staying indoors year.

I’m fully vaccinated point may straight ignore stupid mandate don’t believe it’s job protect willingly unvaccinated adults LA. 

99.9% hospitalizations LA county unvaccinated, really really think new mask mandate going fly. want stress test vaccination sitting indoor room full unvaccinated, unmasked people?  
  
Then wear n95 worry free let everyone else make decision based risk tolerance? follow LA then? Resist follow higher power...CDC Guidelines basic science. Amen! Enough selfish antics! cant wear mask bothers you, wear damn face shield! cant wait till whole thing over. Really eye opener narcissism world. Need restore faith people, Ive seen lot stupid selfish change vaccination rates, may remind folks still pandemic cringe unvaccinated legitimate medical reason be. also tons cold viruses floating around right now. Ive sick twice since May, covid random cold. Oddly enough cold far worse covid, vaccinated got covid tho guess makes sense  PLEASE post many comments try circumventing AutoMod. Honestly still don’t see happening statewide. Newsom literally sunk $100 Billion “California Roars Back” Plan. would stupid move put jeopardy unless shit really hit fan. Also better hear maskless unvaccinated people say “but CDC Guidelines” they’re egregious violation primary reason we’re mess first place  Sorry continue follow higher power...CDC guidelines. reduce number people wanting get vaccinated There's much research J&amp;J, makes look good. would expect mRNA booster 6 months would also good. Nobody’s angry, we’re laughing you. sincerely hope aren’t projecting frustration loneliness onto others, are, hope least grants temporary solace needed fall asleep without tear shed. Utterly tragic.

No, utterly predictable. Tragic wearing seatbelt fails. terribly surprising probably solid recommendation point seeing sharp increase Clark County along every metric.  

Cases, test positivity, hospitalizations sharply up.

Problem long recommendation mandate, people gonna follow limited effectiveness. I'm looking number worsen possible mandate put place. unvaccinated unresponsive group includes kids 11 under

In June, 0.1% covid deaths US people age 17. 6 people 6632. 

The vast majority people died covid June 50+ age group (90%+) assume un-vaccinated choice. “laymen” experienced. 

1.	A Delta outbreak horizon time announcement. 
2.	Any announcement time focused area greatest risk - community high vaccine uptake encourage continue wear masks. 
3.	Healthcare institutions serve - vaxxed unvaxxed - would predictably increased pressure. Hence call nurses encourage mask wearing. 
4.	The divide US large politicized vaccine mandate accepted. 

You feel free go back thru layman’s comments past weeks see said - based experiences countries. Got vaccine. problem anymore.

The US wont' mandate vaccines: fact

We need hit 80-90% immunity vaccines infection hit herd immunity: fact

What's plan can't force people get vaccinated?  need make decision boosters healthcare workers now. Many us 6 months jab. going see huge third wave. I'm happy discussion.

I responded points. responded none mine.

When happens, usually obviously convincing argument. It’s cute think ‘plan’ matters. think you’re one misunderstanding. It’s sequential process of, avaccinated person gets infected, later household gets tested infection, later infections directly attributed initial infection. It’s rate infection within households certain period time, draw inferences rates intra-household transmission. It’s difficult directly locate attribute exact point transmission.  Pretty sure latest belief recovering disease / receiving vaccine stop getting ill transmitting onto others- merely shortens disease's symptoms duration.

[Comments section coviduk that' case I'm unsure whether 80% figure's going cut it. Seems people going get one way another. RIP everybody compromised immune systems  wonder possible people lockdowns. know would mean deliberately choosing stop coming work &amp; money saved handle period time income, etc, may alternative states let virus get control mitigation.  best suicides excuse locking down. OH THOUSANDS SUICIDES EVERY SINGLE DAY? Pretty sure thousands lives worth one life Everyone going get antibodies one way other. Vaccine COVID-19, choice. plan opinion massive asshole, maybe politician. could possibly know vaccinated every 6-8 months indefinitely?

As far i'm aware latest long term data still shows good efficacy 6+ months longer data released yet. 87% eligible vaccines least one. 

Those waiting second vaccine low risk hospitalised (under 40, pre existing conditions)

Lockdown zero covid, it’s long covid, it’s ‘saving world’ whatever BS columnist about. 

The justification lockdown simple one **to stop NHS collapsing**. busy every year respiratory illnesses completely collapsing. moderna perform delta? pfizer advantage due higher mrna dosage? Question: mean people wear masks clubs live music shows dance floors? Seeing social distancing requirement restored, yet, make whole bunch sweaty people tight quarters gasping air.   break vaccinated numbers asymptomatic, mild symptoms, hospitalized, dead drive home point. family friends worried complications vaccine opposed virus. 

To it’s trolley problem come life. may know it’s not, is. folks please upvote people getting denied hospital treatment?

Read article. way written denying care. written access inpatient wards. sound like cannot visit someone hospital. may full it, don’t see changing stance. masks make uncomfortable!…./s  depends specifics. someone gun held head, dont put wet socks die, even high chance dying, perhaps russian roulette type situation one bullet six shooter?

Of course, without hesitation would wear them.

But someone asking wear wet socks every single day multiple years slight chance saving life hinges series incredibly rare events happening sucsession within specific relatively short timeframe? 

In case, no, probably wear them.  huge believer vaccines that's necessarily something would want test 40 hours week.  one today - got first Pfizer jab.

It’s protected information - “that’s HIPAA violation” thing nonsense. company may full it, unless there’s local law forbidding them. numbers Moderna? Interested see whether higher dosage vaccine Moderna creates higher antibody count. Okay bud Wrong title. Read article. TBH I'd rather masks international travel masks international travel. Even masks stop virus spreading countries. Unless *reaaaaaaaally* fine-tuned vaccine passport system think question. would less big deal adults would part. instead throw tantrums. PM Israel giving info, really sure much less effective is, I'd take grain salt.

Mandatory vaccines stricter traffic enforcement laws fully self driving cars. Speeding, using signals, making illegal turns, ass riding. say install monitor software everyone’s car commit infraction, send ticket. stupid willingly accept certain number deaths mode transportation. 

But doubt that’s people mean bring cars comparison lol never followed UK January wave. know much capacity hospital system has? cancel elective surgeries time? 

I done napkin analysis, based people people hospitalized 8 days infection die 18 days infection. took numbers (8 18) looking 7-day peaks cases, new hospitalizations deaths. real answer probably somewhere close +/- couple days. 

As UK seeing 2.20% cases becoming hospitalized 0.20% cases someone dying. 

That done peak 10.56% cases becoming hospitalized 3.08% cases someone dying. 

Assuming numbers correct UK expecting 100,000 cases per day. UK seeing 2,200 new hospitalizations per day 200 deaths per day. 

Those numbers much lower peak January wave 4,233 new hospitalizations per day 1,285 deaths per day. 

Welcome discussions learning want informed. Unless CDC/WHO says fully vaccinated person worry, I'm going to. I'm done lol. Fin angry Swedes? people kept coming Sweden lockdowns? every country average? else ""Swedish exceptionalism"" like wtf, countries waves different times. okay? running list anywhere monoclonal antibody therapies best efficacy certain variants. know I’ve seen (one of?) Lilly cocktail stopped it’s effective certain circulating variants.

Any info best one ones today’s environment? regeneron still golden? Sure, populations children (extremely low risk adverse effects) immunocompromised (admittedly, high risk).. vast majority non-vaccinated America choosing ignore science.

We also fortunate US widespread vaccine availability, don’t think point vaccine shortages really relevant.

I’m sure I’ll get downvoted hell sub though, pretty sure everyone wants wear masks live rock eternity. notice nobody actually refuted logic parent comment, downvoting doesn’t fit narrative. hate don’t see comment often!! isn’t new! say person ends hospital actions? E.g. Obese people heart problems, smokers, heavy drinkers, etc. 50% friends got symptomatic, test-positive COVID vaccinated?

You ask lottery numbers. Statistical probability wild. work allowing go maskless vaccinated people. wear lanyard proof vaccination. lot people complaining masks, wearing nose, ripping yell heard better… there’s still awful lot masks compared people shown vaccinated lanyard. mRNA vaccines really new people think. Sure, first vaccine use it, technology's developed decades. fairly recently (before pandemic) overcame final hurdles getting mRNA vaccine mass produced distributed, lucky timing.

I would guess even COVID happen, mRNA vaccines far off. flu seems like perfect candidate mRNA vaccine. 

mRNA worked quickly vaccine created virus. time essence here. IIRC mRNA vax virus way back January 2020, people even knew COVID-19 was. development took long, testing. sure would every 6 months, especially considering vaccine still provides 80% protection year virus mutate fast flu virus yearly vaccinations required. 

Would every year would nice could combine flu COVID vaccine one shot. feel like spend 2 weekends feeling like shit two different vaccines really expect less 50% country fully vaccinated?  muh dna There's already major nurse shortage, something hire quickly. 

You could make argument firing would put people risk, working unvaxxed. Yeah - it’s really frustrating and, unfortunately suppose, adds animosity refuse vaccinate. “Callously put kids risk, get fucked.” should, ""private business rights"" people suddenly change heart affects braindead constituents. 

There's law legal precedent I'm aware would preclude states stupid enough pass laws enforcing them. Yeah, also clog hospitals healthcare resources us actively trying die Covid (or whatever hell idk).  Depends area. states third vaccinated. data shows there's significant difference across political affiliation. ""my numbers"", they're survey results 30k respondents.

Feel free share sources different point view. Remember early seatbelts could also decapitate Yeah, given infectious delta variant is, one wonder well vaccines hold hotboxing infected person hours end.  wife teacher, almost staff Vaccinated is, however, effectiveness vaccines lower fewer people them, 3 weeks may going School 12 year olds may required wear mask despite unable vaccinated yet. what’s deal anti vaxxers quoting new Israel studies Pfizer significantly less effect Delta variant? I’m seeing mixed articles. They'll learn hard way, guess. 

My University requires vaccination everyone campus: students, faculty, employees across board. People laugh off- masks cause lots problems even help others. unable accurately read facial expressions absolutely hinders socialization. 

And yup, don’t even know endgame anymore. Maybe people say “after kids vaxxed”, even still peaks cases among unvaxxed there. gonna say “well immunocompromised?” say “well they’re still humans save lives”? free vaccine available everyone isn’t enough, is? goal crush people’s morale mental health people crumble again. really can’t keep threat restrictions loom head cases among unvaxxed ever go up. Pretty chilled, vaccines seem changed profile. Everyone know who's last weeks fully vaccinated seem mild symptoms. There's much end. flattening curve accomplish point? masking slow down, get us closer finish line. Everybody either gonna get vaccinated, catch naive immune system. prevent vaccines, delay inevitable masks. mRNA vaccines code spike protein trains immune system recognize spike protein surface virus. code antibodies.  actually read article look like visitation right visit someone inpatient wards. Exactly. one time talk mental health public health issue. it’s midsummer, cases, deaths hospitalizations still conversation two months ago. delta variant produced increase cases, hospitalizations deaths, there’s surge vaccines job variant pops  “Cases up.

But it’s among unvaccinated. cares unvaccinated get sick?

Well actually people don’t choice, like kids 12 immunocompromised.

But kids don’t die covid.

Well actually develop long covid lose cognitive functionality.”

How many times day conversation happen reddit? hints toward work? Don’t want dox anybody, like vote wallet try avoid supporting dumbass people. Totally agree. I'm done giving shit COVID far adjusting behavior goes. wore mask whole damn time, observed restrictions. got vaccinated literally soon turn so. wear mask business situation makes (travel, etc).

I'm done. listening media try scare anything else. need move lives change approach, think Biden administration trying do---change something effects everybody something effects refuse get vaccinated.

The approach sending vaccines abroad countries need them, continue try lead vaccine hesitant water. Time market: mRNA platform developed agile - quickly ""print"" new vaccine.

Effectiveness: Pfizer Moderna's mRNA vaccines significantly effective inactivated virus vaccines. don’t really care things say do. silver lining: ""Of infected, 52 serious condition, two less day before. week earlier, 41. April, 5,900 active cases, similar number now, 340 patients serious condition."" said mid-May, June, nobody would wearing masks.

I knew time age well. People read headline, vaccinated not, let guard down. 3 times last 5 Euros. victories though!  really. idea anti-vax bipartisan faded around 2008, election black man solidified sides. Plenty anti-vax folks voted blue switched red that, red anti-vaxxers outnumber blue ones something like 35 1. inhumane (voluntarily) unvaccinated people hogging hospital beds overtaxing health-care resources disease could minimize vulnerability simplest steps? Don’t forget, efficacy studies done mask mandates, social distancing, etc closely adhered to.

🧐 mean point I’d rather donate vaccines countries people want don’t access due cost. That’s things going mutate. many places 10% people vaccinated. US haven’t it, don’t want government isn’t going incentivize are. deal many school teachers. complain incessantly schools reopening ""cases climbing"" one day, fly away lovely beach resorts next.  even work. Getting vaccine easy…..I work home still rushed get shots safely hang people go restaurants many, kids 12 ones fueling spread vulnerable age groups school year starts month so. think black people following talking points evangelical right?

I’m worried they’re gonna try force whole family shelter place Delta. COVID really illustrated poor people’s understanding risk is. 335 deaths COVID total USA people 18. less half many pneumonia, represents well 1% deaths age group. 

Source data CDC.   market

That's good point. source that, comparing time required roll vaccines based 2 different technologies?

From understanding Sinopharm rolled pretty fast aswell. Unvaccinated almost entirely young, often serious conditions. breakthrough cases occur older people, still potential cause harm.

No, we're zero risk vaccines eradicate virus see ever get zero risk. We're going exposed rest lives. risk that's part lives forever. call reckless behavior, others may call acceptable risk. I'm 95% less likely seriously harmed vaccination, virus something wish exist, though does, anymore level risk leads make serious alterations way live life. He's ""celebrity scientist"" expertise astronomy/astrophysics, nothing related medical field, let alone viruses. surprisingly good recipe ignorance: former stokes ego, latter (being highly educated specific subject) magnifies that, making easy person think expert subjects too. subjects not-uncommonly believe option fits existing priors and/or convenient them. Hope it’s go aquarium fact many people play lottery every week shows everyone thinks they’re outlier. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Still, month June, coronavirus responsible 337 deaths day. comparison, historic average deaths gunshots, car crashes complications flu add 306 day.” Makes Liberalz Angry.

That's reason people anything. vaccinated. Guess good chunk Americans not? know that, that’s kind scary tbh. there’s difference requiring vaccines public schools requiring everyone get vaccine, I’m vaccines. However Jacobson refers law passed state legislature, I’m sure would apply governor’s EO. Though I’m also sure federal courts would even rule that, might leave state courts.

That’s really interesting, though I’m skeptical SCOTUS today would uphold decision. least, think would require mandatory vaccine would full approval FDA, vaccine currently does.

I ultimately government power mandate *everybody* takes certain drug gets certain vaccine. There’s much potential abuse mistakes, imo.

Finally, require get vaccinated make businesses require proof vaccination

may true, least two intertwined think, though IANAL. Unfortunately heard kids approval fall 6 won’t till mid winter younger. gets oldest although one better none suppose. It’s taking long kids. 2 teams?  Private business already prohibited discriminating certain areas: race, religion, gender, etc. state laws would basically make ""vaccination status"" protected class, something similar, business could use condition hire. Wow, Arizona really wants eat young. Words like surge unnecessary. Uptick like it. people less likely, 'no longer'

Also, covid's airborn nature means need infected carrier Luckily, children dying rate vaccine refusers. were, vaccine refusers might actually care. ""Who cares Darwin? We're letting Jesus take wheel, baby!""

\-some redneck Missouri probably things affect people much infectious disease does. Obesity infectious.  surgeon knows epidemiology? Probably amount epidemiologist knows surgery. Well bunch people worried missing work side effects shot, wish public health messaging people says get don’t quarantine anymore due exposure that’s potentially two weeks missed work! seems still ways reach people. think September always expected able report results, would reviewed (which would take months) Well, go vaccinate people bad place start year due everything else wrong, since vaccinations started. Nowhere else go 3-month lockdown start year. They're bragging England going ""most open"" country Europe rest Europe much freedom since start year (compared UK).

And anyway, remains seen whether getting everybody vaccinated breakneck speed even right way go. vaccines lose effectiveness certain period time (and manufacturers said idea effective they'll 6 months), vulnerable (who vaccinated first) wide-open UK restrictions, god knows many cases day, millions people potentially needing boosters vaccinations. potential variant factory described.

It's yet another gamble Tories. why? Agreed. Effective are, nothing ever 100%. worry great deal tempting mutation gods forcing people likely vaccinated (like teachers) spend tons time people literally can't get vaccinated yet likely wearing masks. state force either private company publicly traded company   require vaccination? 

Ask governor Florida.  Title wrong. 

The FDA official told CNN Friday decision full approval likely come within two months. agency considers matter priority, said official, asked named authorized speak publicly matter.

Open see that’s second paragraph. No, hypothetically cause hospitals overflow would still inhumane deny treatment treatment still available. least look back fondly fifteen minutes actually gave damn flyover banging pots pans.

Title wrong Fall winter going terrible covid doubt. 

It's sickening see happen watch whole continent Africa going lack vaccines half Americans turn pampered noses refuse take! someone explain good move? reason behind thought process.  look UK, two weeks ahead us regards Delta, seeing increase deaths nowhere near percentage seeing vaccine nearly alarming. 

I mean, makes sense. vast majority vulnerable vaccinated. know answer honestly. know people community always shocked someone vaccinated got Covid. 5k cases day now, mostly delta, low vaccination mask wearing rate. I'm surprised. person immediate family vaccinated refused get vaccinated reasons. 

1. heard horror stories vaccine side effects miscarriages, infertility, death.

2. don’t think covid big enough deal risk getting injection.

3. vaccines testing long enough deemed safe.

4. Distrust government modern medicine. 

These people think wearing mask long period time result lung disease lack oxygen government using masks lockdowns means control population. paranoid fed sensationalized false information facebook youtube. However, reasons avoiding vaccines masks never political beyond perhaps source news. Well sadly vaccine doesn’t work guess mask forever. 95% effective vaccine isn’t good enough? Good call  think downvoted stating statistics. think problem easy say 7 kids, course small percentage, parent one kids would make feel different. 

As parent child 2, I'm struggling whole situation. logical part says odds kid catching sort severe problems low let's go live lives. hand part like child one unlucky ones something bad happens. would live myself? 

So statistically speaking, child safe, easy decide do. Lack public health care system far greater threat. Federal law prohibits employers mandating EUA vaccinations employees. Assuming two years evidence get approved see mandated. opinion.

Navy, Air Force, Army surgeon generals, far off. SGs medical doctors hold commission respective medical corps.

It unlikely many business especially bars restaurants enforce time likely little County knows it. phrased badly, super tired. vaxxed, hoping 2 year old get vaccine baby sister arrives. think power think challenged court now, they'd lose. 

The state power public health emergency, objectively longer public health emergency. cure/prevention half people country taken they, group, largely avoided hospitalization. Also cure widely available anyone corner drugstore cases, calling number brought you.

No, power gave state, abuse power (unintentional opinion, challenging that's I'd frame it) therefore unconstitutional mandate rescinded.

Theres several times I've gone stores last weeks everyone still wearing mask wasn't. people seeing took there's off. people something unless someone else already it. need boost courage whatever.

Later overturned supreme court btw True. CDC says unvaccinated people still wear masks. 

But mandates lifted vaccinated verification using honor system, imagine unvaxxed people wearing them. 

It's stupid. anti vax crowing, see told vaccines BS! vaccinated go back masks again!

And still.won't.do.the.right.thing. make us suffer stupidly! pity poor store workers face murderous rage unmasked unvaccinated physically assaulted, spit cursed etc minimum wage! “If get confronted employee respectfully explain fully vaccinated choosing follow CDC guidelines science backs guidelines.”

This said do, disagreed with. you’re saying right originally said do. imprisoned falsifying medical records. Much like politics, depending youth right thing (get vaccinated / vote) always disappoints. agree. Thanks. masks cost economy cause businesses close can't meet requirements? Bars night clubs can't really function mask mandate orders.  exactly. data surrounding efficacy vaccines changing daily. studies aren’t always exactly same, broader picture paint clear consistent: vaccines highly effective preventing infection, full stop, even effective preventing severe outcomes like hospitalization, especially death. provide study says otherwise?

Look, missed going big time. also really far back line vaccine. 

So waited. That's it. Parents young kids freaking COVID terrible math. kids died swimming pools last year.   ""mild"" clinical term means ""not hospitalized"" -- high fevers, O2 level still high enough need hospital bed &amp; oxygen. drop link military ship? I’ve looking article can’t find Parents children younger 12, can’t get vaxxed yet? “Is fine”

Not according data.

Why would dems need run ”COVID restrictions”? Unfortunate true. are. someone that's vaccinated still carrying (it happens), may still get people bar sick. end, lot sick people bar, even vaccinated person runs small risk sick.

Kinda like skipping party friends hit colds recently. change fact young adults bothered. problem unvaccinated people overwhelm hospitals, wont room people needs care urgent care, heart, cancer etc. dont think government cares much unvaccinated innocent happens need medical care reasons Yes!!! omg another lockdown coming!! I’m saying don’t take seriously 100% I’m fully vaxxed. Lockdowns coming back. US going ""manageable"" camp much longer. already starting swing back full restrictions.   Unlawful order? CDC made suggestion, fact, quite clearly defer regulation masks vaccinated people resume activities without wearing mask physically distancing, except required federal, state, local, tribal, territorial laws, rules, regulations, including local business workplace guidance*

I would suggest trying say unlawful order. now. starts again. things don’t get better, point harsher restrictions. don’t think we’re going back winter 2020 levels expect capacity limits follow maybe weeks. Cool, hopefully you’re right people like don’t provide virus opportunity mutate something ensures pandemic continues long time come. conflate science CDC. science said masks worked back march 2020, yet... week started requiring proof vaccinated work wearing mask holy shit! one like 3 people wearing mask guess ones fully vaccinated. think even vaccinated. kind sad enraging time showed many coworkers unvaccinated wearing mask. thought (or hoped) really vaccinated. much, much less likely hospitalized you’re vaccinated. hospitalized patients unvaccinated, you’re 100% protected vaccine, especially areas delta variant taking hold. friend covid December got again, ymmv. friends got covid got vaccine months later fine. Get vaccinated! It’s unfortunate you’re downvoted anti maskers flooded sub last months. You’re speaking practically possible information have, unfortunately people don’t want hear it. They’ll always first restriction put 

Do seriously think mandate make anti vaxxers go get vaccinated? yeah right, masks first rest soon follow. question possible complications side effects you’ve covid already. don’t see much information wondering Florida fully open year fine, dems run COVID restrictions they’re going lose 50 seats deserve it. people skipping vaccines Delta variant, shocking.

Get damn vaccine already. don’t really know long term effects yet. growing evidence impacts brain organs. Even it’s small % cases issue would better could protect kids vaccines. It’s almost people obviously tired shit, they’re starting less drastic options, mask mandate low-impact thing doesn’t impact economy.  get vaccine anyways?  snarky, good idea so. infected, strong protection serious illness. infected, it'll nice boost immune system increased protection. tricky... organizations operate approved agendas. makes PHS much less nimble addressing shifting currents medicine science.

Years ago, got interview Assistant Surgeon General anti-obesity campaign. trouble-maker, asked problem really fitness?... fit obese person might healthier unfit thin person.

Needless say got no-comment.

Agendas set need permission mother ship answer off-script questions.  certain states. Others passed laws prevent future lockdowns. don’t think wise, certainly glad live L.A. right now. test positive problems? Statistically shape, youngest demographic. measures they’re ok  ok. We'll get made numbers tmrw I'm sympathetic chef. concert guy, oh well, bet poor. either, trust me. one asthma susceptible chest infections. I'm willing risk it. hoping vaccine would available sooner mid winter, know that's pointless. Why?  good news hundreds millions infected, good number able mount strong immune response encounter virus going helpful time we've still able vaccinate small percentage world's population.  what? Paywall Exactly. you, vaccinated, accept restrictions freedom aren't? care much unvaccinated, *force* get vaccine instead forcing everybody else wear mask. I'm kind throwing random thought getting vaccine also help potentially reduce chance virus mutating yet another variant since vaccinated would able defeat virus quicker. mention transmission vaccinated individuals others slightly less unvaccinated. solid work detective. thanks NFL owners make Covid vaccination condition employment cancel contract player refuses. Agreed. Stupid question, so? I've trying figure longest anti-mask/anti-vax rhetoric beneficial. Like what's endgame? political. ""This would state would allow it,"" they're saying. Considering Trump pals pushing piles misinformation flat lies, shocking ignore anything say. Get vaccinated. Johnson Johnson perfect option who've already confirmed infection.  Yeah see improvements   Shocking. Yes, work better you’ve symptoms 3-5 days problem countries need doses first second shots, described works delta. lamba evade vaccines, point variant will. Again, scared can't jabbed, focus diet, and/or return normal life. Call selfish think 12 demographic overwhelmingly fine. Look data. informed decision. Go back read articles. Google news search friend here.  truly mind-boggling many people get worked something trivial. absolutely shameful selfishness people. science doesn’t, shouldn’t, care latches onto what. Mandated FDA approval healthcare workers There's apparently sizable chunk sub wants pretend masks best thing ever inconvenient annoying all. Among unvaccinated people. could care less, sorry. idk best way think this. Yes got vaccinated. deserve help get. Indeed also think Sputnik ""best"" options among 3. problem none vaccines barely respects Western strictness trials, transparency safety controls, even Western vaccines come without issues. get Russians' sentiments it. fact vaccine work (EpiVacCorona) gets administered anyway concerning. mean least offensive least harsh way imaginable: don’t care. sub-debate isn’t worth having. win.  Seems double lung transplants people cystic fibrosis. disease might partly responsible short lifespan son missed classroom last two months third grade fourth stayed home keep community safe. going back classroom CDC isn’t requiring vaccinations staff teachers masks students. enraged beyond words this. Beyond furious. child child depressed last spring. gave much entitled idiotic antivaxers making naught. retail worker, please don’t this. Retail workers say matter making lives unnecessarily difficult fucking stressful. Don’t involve us shit. We’ve already gotten screamed enough.    Pretty sure people UK vaccinated AZ vaccine already shown way less effective variants Pfizer/Moderna/JNJ. 

I would curious though data UK positive cases vaccinate vs unvaccinated also hospitalization/deaths. Everyone needs calm claims “Look vaccines don’t work see!”. one ever said 100% effective INFECTION. 90+% effective serious illness/hospitalization/death, though. Also, locking would worst thing. delays inevitable. Two ways defeat virus vaccines natural immunity hiding house.   Shoulda never stopped requiring them. not? Israel tried remove masks, failed.

And LA too. Given sense “surprise” completely demolished pandemic, wouldn’t fully count anything. said, it’s odd “the lockdowns coming” somehow always tied vaccines. majority reporting I’ve seen it’s either vaccine, lockdown death. 3 options. can’t tell many articles I’ve seen actually double check referring US and/or sars-cov-2. It’s emotionally charged you’d think even newer, deadlier virus third world country. Don’t get wrong, virus challenging much preventative stand point. Let alone fact antivirals coming along successfully (relatively) quickly. daily main stream articles? collectively championing incredible scientists advancements? (For worried, scared plain sick all, call doctor local clinic. far less emotionally charged access latest developments) Honestly, think it’s time surgeon generals warning main stream media. both. parents elementary bullied district masks. None kids vaccinated cases rise. Enough enough.  loss masks personally offend many people. Masks equated businesses opening restrictions imposed. Instead people act wearing mask fate worse death. actually, wore masks close effective, more, vaccines. that's 95%+ population wore masks

vaccine passports never happen work. bullshit unsealed little print anyone make, tbh. masks obvious  delta variant contagious appears deadly younger demographics compared others. There's guarantee another mutation make even worse.  speak lot certainty us early thing. Let’s hope right, I’m personally sure yet.  better trend. Forcing vaccinated people wear masks security theater *definitely* fault people making decision. Probably high rate big families work jobs involve around people. make martir 101 whale ?  even close dude, benefits getting vaccine far outweigh risks getting covid - mention longer able infect others; shit's no-brainer, unvaxxed ones dumb hell. think see vaccine passports US full FDA approval. point figure schools, employers, medical offices, domestic air travel require proof vaccine. said isn’t Republicans don’t want get vaccinated get downvoted. open time well. Indoor dining allowed Montreal well week now, along bars. 


A sizeable portion population vaccinated mask still requirement help reduce risk. masks kids then? Got it. got note printed low quality recycled paper saying ""yep, got thing"" lol Florida isn’t playing game anymore, someone Florida worried COVID, got vaccinated, weren’t, didn’t, Florida fully opened won’t close again. Doesn’t sound terrible me. Gesch, poor people. worried getting they've 3 times. hope Pfizer makes safe. disagreeing you. personally speaking look happening.  area going nuts living life. area getting bad reevaluate stance. LA right wrong reimplement masking Good. force people take vaccines approved FDA, yet. However support required get official approved. EUA . IS. NOT. OFFICIAL. APPROVAL!!!! dark side legalization nobody talks about. Even people low hospitalization rates overwhelm hospitals enough them. hospital runs nearly 90% full without COVID. take much overwhelm us, lead deaths going up.  👆 Mask mandates fault people instituting mandates. fault people refuse get vaccinated going back, refused wear mask. ....is safe mention lab leak theory now?  unbelievable. vaccinated unvaccinated one symptomatic  statistics data elusive, discoverable deep search. :) “I obedient! followed government Daddy Biden said. getting punished people obedient, that’s fair!😠😠” I’ve learned accept it. listened episode American Life talked vaccine hesitancy. actually informative. Listening, nonjudgmental tone, giving real-world examples people know it’s affected seemed help. government clearly intend take steps enforce uninoculated mask up. they're making mandate broad hoping anti-mask mania horseshoe them. I’m talking mainstream publications dismissing idea “conspiracy theory.” I’m talking Facebook “fact checkers”removing posts mentioning theory. vaccinated people took masks, unvaccinated folks thought COVID-19 disappeared. Sure, numbers went *because vaccine,* small pockets unvaccinated folks believe decrease somehow ""justifies"" skepticism regarding COVID-19. know that. According mom, concert guy already decided wait 10 years (!) got vaxxed, suggests eligible. Also, he's clearly obese, many states would made eligible far earlier April. 100 cases day whole country stretched brink? Completely understand anger it’s illegal refuse care Talk doctor, they'll best resource overall. general, vaccinated, good idea. article nauseating 3 days nausea Pfizer vaxx. difference 3 days nausea rather innocuous. plain fucking gross. it’s like people labeled people pushing possible narrative origin. don’t know anyone crucified saying “we don’t know came from” considering thats truth now. thought obvious exit plan CDC.

Release vaccine majority seniors strong percentage population gets. Open everything happens unvaccinated happens.

Anyway, concerned countries around world get vaccine. certain age children statistically better chance dying flu Covid-19. logic every year? Yup. safe, effective, widely available vaccine. That’s safe get. feel bad immunocompromised people but, can’t go forever this. That’s literally true said control. control river flows help control flooding. doesn’t always work, us better nothing. It’s NPIs. helps. Well LA isn’t South. likely due legalities involved US, requiring masks much easier legally. EpiVacCorona work.

CoviVac uses old well tested whole virion technology. problems safety (it's quite popular, way. Supplies constantly depleted). enough data collected though.

Personally, chose Sputnik best option available me. ""premature rule out""

Ah HA! definitive incontrovertible proof fuel millions smug comments internet. could get kind concrete statement made efficacy safety COVID countermeasures, could convince people get vaccinated wear mask pro forced vaccinations well.  One many reasons I’m looking move LA. Entitlement selfishness part LA culture unfortunately.  Agreed  ""Do research"" favorite. 

All right, let's get grants, rent lab space equipment, snag post-docs start researching this!

Note: profanity removed avoid offending asinine robot overlord. wearing mask target denying life?? everything open fully could care less wear mask I’m close someone be.  virus originated city known lab studying... wait it... Coronavirus.

They labeled conspiracy theory almost immediately called everyone xenophobe thinking plausible something bad happened. China tried hide bad months world could preparing.

I think hard say things went media politically motivated. don’t think all. That’s really point measure. think help control least spread Covid minimal cost economy. That’s mask mandate reimplemented. Oh yea trust know (I active duty ship once). fact got 100 cases fully vaccinated crew scary though... okay? Im saying pandemic end soon.  morons going die higher numbers, also allow mutation virus infect vaccinated again.

This like insane ppl Birdbox wanted everyone else ""see"" whatver killer thing was.   I’ve noticed one common tactics simply stonewall anything inconvenient point. simply acknowledge it’s there. point say already dealt it.

The people know real life narcissists. Shots*    statistically, Hispanic black people getting vaccinated. people valid medical reason vaccinated. age groups Israel 95% received least one dose rest either covid-19 refuse get it.

Vaccine passport implemented every country asap. serious? risk way lower car accident. risks avoided, can't live without taking risks..   Many people weren’t required show ids get vaccine. know wasn’t. wish could award heard epidemiologist 100% confirm that. Oh Ross Carrie! interview:
  decided. several groups figures moment. clearly now. England goes opening probably provide good test case.  when? CDC guidelines, exactly? People medical encounters still required wear masks current guidelines, vaccinated not. never said vaccinated people good go maskless every situation. They’re looking current guidelines going one step above. That’s pretty standard response infection control guidelines. Imagine long month government time. someone relatively confident they're likely contract virus

Wait couple days try get test test covid influenza. Mine turned flu.   UC system mandated flu vaccine anyone campus Fall 2020. weeks later, whole idea quietly went away never enforced (seems mandate still books though). must behind scenes politics effectively killed it. expect might happen time.  Ah yes. ""stay home"" argument. I've seen previously want even remotely participate degree precautionary measurement(s) potentially mitigate pandemic. Yet people like quick simply say ""stay home"" can't get vaccinated and/or feel safe. Meanwhile, fail consider people cannot get jab, medical conditions even vaccinated, still puts risk contracting potentially dying Covid.

Your stay home argument idiotic, best. anyone may fall categories mentioned forced stay home simply people like you, get vaccinated, choose to, simply wear fucking piece cloth nose mouth? nobody listened lmao I’m tired seeing comment. Viruses don’t want anything. little floating pieces RNA. makes COVID dangerous distinguishes SARS incubates level transmission presymptomatic stage well fact presents people common cold. time you’re hospitalized you’ve already infected everyone going infect anyways. every single person caught Covid dropped dead day 14 symptom onset, wouldn’t spread slower. 1 night tom cruise convinced hundreds staff faculty convert Scientology. religious beliefs, cannot asked take vaccination. 

(I dont think scientology official view covid vaxx dont wanna fuck around get hit lawsuit tell thay cant get it.) curious, many spikes across country due July 4th celebrations? Like, could see possible decrease cases weeks? agree many measures hospitals? need critically important care something? seems step far me.  45 risk dying covid even seriously ill small. 20 - flu scarier that. 

Get adults (teachers) vaccinated touch kids. need honestly maybe let covid thang lol That's probably healthiest you. raises blood pressure reading small facts get purposeful huge lie built around people thought reasonable falling them. mortgage professional, he's lying.   Yup, compliance always voluntary. That’s still wear mask indoors, even though I’m vaccinated live area high vaccination rates. think face-masks get much credit there. course, preventing COVID-19 important, keeping forever avoid common cold plainly stupid. Apart COVID-19 severy immunocompromised avoid viruses there. Common flu colds small chance serious damage need contact help immune system better prepared.

Everyone fascinated Asians mask-wearing. think they're mostly worn work culture. People probably wear alternative taking sick leave, reasonable. Public health officials make clear statements wearing masks prevent colds wise. USA probably lot people treat masks political statement. We're bad spot make everything political. Scandinavian countries progressive relaxed mask mandates around world.  inexcusable done yet. much hope join together help end pandemic, see happening. politicized, it, GG, least America. Well considering people education construct many test going public data, wouldnt happen. would someone come vaccine saying unsafe, scientist many test coming forward???

Common sense data awareness left game...
Everybody screams vax everything.
Nobody asking really positive effect kids barely affected disease.
Just pure crazyness point. let’s real- vaccine wonderful, alpha well 90-95% effective range. delta anywhere close effective. Still effective, 70% range. remember seeing many people comment and/or family members going India (right around start crisis there) fully vaccinated getting symptomatic Covid. Since seen overwhelming amount comments vaccinated people coming Covid. It’s surprising told vaccinated people mask again. Yet mention get lambasted anti-vax ffs. 100% pro-vaccines think 100% foolproof time ffs. also doesn’t help [his wife weird It’s never gonna end matter that’s people need start grasp. 

The goal never zero deaths. COVID stay. goal overwhelm hospitals. explain that's excuse? masks work _the way they're commonly used_ outside models, sure. way see everyday people use them, worry they're providing false sense security. 

I see poorly fitted N95s, filthy (usually cloth) masks, loose surgical masks time. Last summer park, coworker snidely commented kids playing outdoors without masking, pulled pink reusable ""N95"" turning brown.

I'm vaccinated I'm disheartened fact we're still debating intervention less evidence. tell effective vaccine supposed be, idea effective masks are.  right too. Vaccine = wearing stupid masks. I’ve done part, Really? go there?

That seems main refrain pandemic, no? That's 7 many overall?   I'll admit wearing mask often since getting vaccinated that's changing now. I'm going go back wearing one public. enough us it, non-vaxed MAYBE least feel pressured masking again.  Wrong even vaccinated get delta lambada variant . Stop eating meat that’s real cause pandemic go vegan. confirm, people hated even questioning it. still plausible explanation. sure hell hope Trudeau's phone Biden they're working way validate vaccination proof, last thing want see sub couple months' time reports people crossing fake vaccination cards. far many self-righteous assholes used Alaska loophole last summer illegally vacation Rockies, I'm sure there's going fuckery time too.

Yeah feel like ever place mask usage remain encouraged perpetuity, public transit (particularly winter months). Think much general disease spread could curbed destigmatizing wearing mask bus/train/metro. terms credentials, former FDA commissioner currently serves board Pfizer. means 1) experience public health messaging 2) gets see lot happens behind scenes light Pfizer's big role pandemic. 

Credentials aside though, personally think best mainstream ""Covid talking head"" pandemic. addition data driven level headed, prediction track record quite good. example, back vaccine supply scarce, hit nail head predicting would quickly flip excess supply around April so. Vaccinated? listening All-In podcast latest episodes. David sacks got covid getting vaccinated, probably delta variant. vehemently government forcing telling people get vaccinated. thought college students get vaccine. position reversed since got covid vaccinated person.

Now vaccine passport, employers asking vaccine records get fired. hate conservatives “evolve” beliefs suffer. Fox busy telling viewers get vaccinated. Tucker won’t tell vaccinated not, creating doubt minds people vaccine. What’s end game? kill base voters? None makes sense. swear CDC bunch dreamers idea control thing. Oh yeah people can’t trusted safety argument, nice. exemptions usually require fair amount paperwork pursued small minority students. campus thousands people young fully vaccinated, matter infinitesimal number exempt people walking around? Ironically, getting covid cause infertility. again, lot people shouldn’t kids, cause world becoming like movie Idiocracy every day.  think also depends maintenance.

Already vaccinated? Ohio legislature also passed nonsense heavily restrict governor unilaterally recall exact terms. amazing entire party look 650k dead Americans think ""We're much!"" know people applauding Macron also angrily accused UK government trying make vaccines mandatory   People still take flu shots? Vermont, like said, closest, 66.6% fully vaccinated according Bloomberg. Bloomberg lists Mass 63% fully vaxxed. flat hyperbole. UK one vaccinated countries world level natural immunity also relatively high. Thus, probably one least likely breeding grounds Earth new variants emerge. Covid stay can't lockdown forever.

I problem mask mandates even vaccinated restrictions travel etc. gone way long, making international travel pretty much impossible.

We need learn live covid, majority us already vaccinated, keep lockdown ""just case new variant pops up"" never reopen. think fact getting tons votes despite reasonably pointing possibel downsides strategy shows exactly approach drive people ""camps"" :( I've missed bad, Toronto!! \*sob\* fact lot public health experts seem limited understanding human behavior one main takeaways pandemic. here. Knocked ass couple days. family members feel thing though. Vaccines endgame, reason LA shutting enough people took delta variant spreads faster coupled unvaccinated people wearing masks supposed CDC CA's ""honor"" system. There's source something exist.  Oh, thought meant whole time. Yeah, Florida great guys! third country new infections! remember year ago still 5 months reaching nearly impossible goal creating vaccine getting ready distribution year. we're seemed impossible, yet anyway. We've run issues, nothing scale seen second wave Spanish Flu tools. I'm yet ready give resign like long term. Restaurants abolished due risk food borne illnesses large scale well communicable diseases (flu, cold, measles).

Speed limits nationwide roads 25 mph reduce many injuries deaths implemented. 

Also believe alcohol legal? leads MANY deaths injuries. absolutely made illegal. government shouldn’t protect One asthma well. home schooled last year need year well. sucks, cannot chance getting covid top asthma. people getting covid - including asymptomatic people - end lung damage (ground glass opacities). top asthma could end life long health issue. choice.

Except since enough folks vaccinated, maybe hospitals get overwhelmed parts country. knew would happen.. [That's Brisk Thanks! Yea matter position hold, people hate either way, bother me. I'm realist. talk people everyday. People reasons sides. Nobody wants intentionally harm loved ones. There's lot ignorance, misinformation, fear confusion this. Everyone thinks what's best loved ones. ones frustrate really know better really care others. 😡  We're glad live too!  think saying CDC hampered politics March last year bit understatement Well told 16 month low risk. boomers low risk deal consequences climate change. agree don’t need forever surges come put back. things get even little better return. many people abusing it. Remember it’s supposed unvaccinated leave  Say initial study done vaccinated individuals living largely unvaccinated population 

No. Clinical trials double blinded. Volunteers randomly given either placebo vaccine, symptoms monitored months. Nether volunteers, doctors, vaccine companies know later. 210 people symptomatic pcr-positive covid. unblinding find 200 unvaccinated 10 vaccinated: 95% efficacy. 

Real world data different absolutely problems describe. simple example AZ incorrectly shown better Pfizer early real-world data, given entire nursing home groups (who zero exposure) Pfizer given health care workers (who still really high exposure). main reason CDC advise masks unvaccinated protection. makes little difference vaccinated non vaccinated people do. White whale, la Moby Dick. 200 symptoms associated long Covid spanning 10 organ systems—including memory loss, hallucinations, tremors fatigue—according new study published Thursday, providing one comprehensive insights yet lingering debilitating illness affect patients months years infection.

Big business evil dystopian yet y’all froth mouth JJ Pfizer juice. LMAO gg  3 choices:

1) nothing, watch cases skyrocket again, risk new, awful variants breakthrough cases

2) Everybody mask again

3) Actually implement enforce vax passports.

This brainer. think perceived endgame vaccination. problem is, everybody getting vaccinated. slowed snail's pace feels like. Still around 65%.

If perceived endgame full vaccination anywhere close completely disconnected reality. Kids get flu shots. bright side, you’ll natural immunity buy time get vaccine. also try calling CVS Walgreens see could send someone pick up. parents aren’t home, might even able send someone vaccinate house.

That’s reason though. It’s mostly safe vaccinated people maskless. Breakthrough cases breakthrough hospitalization/death still rare people IC. point vaccines ease take precautions forever, unsustainable long term.

Basically look Abbott IgG test, 10 times higher, look 2 tests, like 1.5 times higher. I'm actually interested whether anyone know difference? measurement thing scale exponential? 1.5 vs 10 definitely makes totally different headlines. 

Also according researcher himself, 10 times relationship consistent original trial results. **Quote** ""According Nature Medicine article linked above, 10-fold 13-fold differences neutralizing antibody titers would correspond substantial differences vaccine effectiveness, consistent clinical trial data (12/16)"" 10-fold relationship pretty much expected guess. see Personally disagree case.

I understand masks effective all, CDC says they're longer necessary good progress change mind two months later, obviously going work well might think will. Especially seemingly already factored noncompliance first announcement.  degree super masks? point feel like oppression? 


Bro, need better lie! plan hide bed “Omega Variant” announced Nice, enjoy flight home time!  actually enforce mask mandate unvaccinated people? Otherwise bother anything all. Virtually every covid case unvaccinated person.

I'm vaccinated. punished wearing mask heat wave protect looney anti-vaxxer ***still*** wear mask? agree there's chance happening America, feel differently. care ""reward"" shape vaccination card ""free"" wear mask. care real reward: wear mask, I'm potentially saving others. Likely dying point, least getting sick.

Nobody covid symptoms liked them. Vaccination prevent infection, prevents infection getting serious. Wearing mask small thing big thing others. I'll never understand throwing fit simple measure.

To me, exactly wearing seat belt. I'm pretty sure nobody exactly likes wear one, tiny inconvenience compared potential benefit understand wearing it. I'm ""rewarded"" ""free"" without seat belt - quite opposite actually. responsible ""oh scary Delta spikes"" anyway. **Summary** (by me)

Study conducted Umeå University Sweden shows mixing AstraZeneca (1st dose) Moderna (2nd dose) provides good antibody levels protection Beta (South African) variant.

Do note however relatively small study (n=88), prove anything adds yet another data point mixing vaccines effective strategy. 

The study published interested: mRNA vaccine second dose first receiving Astra Zeneca vector vaccine provides good protection covid-19. combination vaccines also leads significantly higher antibody levels, compared supplementing variety, also protects South African virus variant. shown new study Umeå University, results may impact current future vaccine strategies.*

Earlier year, reports Astra Zeneca's vector vaccine covid-19 cause rare severe side effects form blood clots, especially younger people. Sweden today, therefore, vaccine used people age 65, many countries, younger people already vaccinated Astra Zeneca choose receive mRNA vaccine second dose. present, however, limited knowledge effective so-called heterologous prime-boost strategies humans.

In new research study, published top-ranked medical journal New England Journal Medicine, researchers Umeå University examined compared immune responses side effects people received two doses Astra Zeneca received one dose Astra Zeneca dose Modernas mRNA vaccine.

\- limited study 88 people, clearly see Moderna's mRNA vaccine works excellently enhance antibody response first dose Astra Zeneca gave, says Mattias Forsell, associate professor immunology Umeå University leads work. .

The study also shows received Modern vaccine second dose receive significantly higher levels SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies received Astra Zeneca, antibodies also neutralize South African strain (beta strain) coronavirus. subjects study healthcare professionals ages 23 62, received vaccine doses 9–12 week intervals.

\- proportion mild side effects slightly higher group received Moderna second dose, relatively expected based already described Astra Zeneca's Moderna's vaccines, says Johan Normark, associate professor infectious diseases responsible clinical part work.

The results Umeå University verified independent laboratory, collaboration researchers Karolinska Institutet Region Värmland.

\- findings may important current future vaccine strategies Sweden world, additional doses vaccine probably needed obtain full protection long period time, Mattias Forsell adds.

Good news he's able walk 2 miles. OTOH, used ""opportunity"" original infection quit tobacco, way could smoke ARDS. Fun times. passed screenings cleared international flight! I’m finally able go home! masking, nights hunting vaccine appointment, side effects totally worth it! fully agree this. 

Vaccines there, free take. Masks feel need extra protection. lot workplaces made arrangements work home. People know avoid excessive exposure. So...

Or countries go eradication, mean vaccinations, followed harsh lockdown permanent border closures like NZ stop BS increasingly insane rules. Like, alas, Los Angeles Israel.

But necessary? Delta cases vaccinated people asymptomatic mild, anyway? definitely impression got. guess group started clearing soon became apparent wrong. believe people really seem think absolutes. Nuance evades them. Stay safe. kind idiot government gives kind license approval ""naturopathic doctor"" first place? think it’s stupid aren’t checking vaccine cards. present id buy certain stuff. 

And us fly longer “a hours” time. flight time airport really sucks mask 10+ hours time. 

And it’s necessary us vaccinated.  That’s going me. find hard see going solution, easiest solution going get much vaccine passports nice theory, asking lot underpaid overworked service workers put lives line enforce that.

Naw. high schools, colleges, huge number employers required vaccinations, would largely solve without issues.

As is, many people *never* going get vaccinated. idea mask forever? back slowing spread keeping area curve same? Masks (even vaccination rate) capable suppressing new daily cases much.

In case, experts said believe healthcare capacity going threatened. principle (and hope don't!), able substantially new daily cases even peak last year run sort capacity issues. already got vaccinated.

As aren't, bringing back masks going make already-stagnant vaccination intake slow even more.  mean saw comment deleted didn’t sound like “incivility” say, definitely subculture doomsayers. They’re harder spot cause pandemic, there’s lot legit doom said. barely protecting begin with. 90% reduction even getting infected COVID, top much higher chance asymptomatic. Vaccinated people likely spreading COVID real numbers. revealing key problem approach: We're enforcing arbitrary rules folks right thing got vaccinated ones didn't.

There's enough jabs everyone now. There's reason enforcing mask mandates vaccinated people. vaccine outperforms mask. 60-70% locality? Covid oct I’m early 30’s still deal fatigue, Dizziness, nasal congestion 24/7, head pressure sense smell pretty much quarter use be. Long Covid legit sucks. That's going tested soon Arkansas, we'll see bad get reality starts setting in. Im hearing people thought pandemic starting talk work, ofcourse there's still ones completely delusional entire pandemic.   Feel better soon! kids could still wear mask voluntarily. 5 year old camp wears mask others don’t. They’re fine it.

I'm glad kid situation happened around kid still wore mask CDC announcement May (which even say kids take masks!) got bullied relentlessly. fully vaccinated American transmit it, fully vaccinated Canadian. don’t get difference.  mad ‘them’ masks situation doesn’t change laws nature. Cases rising risks rising. person make determination willing take simple prudent precautions. Especially states low vaccination rates reinstitute mask mandates. areas see mandates return cities high vaccination rates.  trials taking longer community spread dropped good bit May June.

No, extending time period want monitor 2 months 4 months. Nothing posted accurate all. Sure, religious part isn't. exempt note registered doctors office. think masks alienating, dystopian, scary, dehumanizing portion population (amount varies country) decidedly anti-vaxx get vaccine regardless told. easiest solution make mandatory legally tough thing many countries. Authoritarian regimes like China could West? Unlikely.

So percentage anti-vaxx people herd immunity can’t achieved I’m sure solution is. Even banning unvaccinated certain things (say, air travel example) won’t push die-hards get jab.  Last year, 57k covid deaths, 362k excess deaths.  


So setting new daily record terrible. Less 15% fully vaccinated. Yeah, see lot ""Well, COVID bad X thing worry it!"" X thing something society spend lot money go great lengths get level. Also even bad thing would want voluntarily add another risk kids life? read that. feel hopeless country. pandemic last forever bc anti vaxxers Young people Ireland cannot get vaccinated. highest rates world people actually wanting vaccines, need vaccine lottery here. Yeah, I’m struggling too. I’ve worn mask entire time told to, got vaccinated first week eligible. point, don’t see wearing mask protect people refuse acknowledge science? great news - Would love know solid date start booking travel plans It’s yet clear different Delta w.r.t children. Swedish (younger) kids schools without masks whole past year far know hasn’t reports horrible outcomes kids. original version alpha though course. wish could done,

A lot could done government institutions refuse might make anti-vaxxers mad. Instead we're going opposite direction states like Tennessee stopping anything push vaccine all, even ones around decades. need ""free dumbs"" - dare block citizens going places unvaccinated unmasked, risking health lives others? Ugh. ""I'm going reflect recurring feeling impending doom"" - head CDC telling us feelings helping. say March 2020, said March 2021 amidst huge decline new cases deaths vaccines starting open anybody wants one. escorted building fired second words left mouth. needed get 90%+ students, faculty, staff vaccinated.

This effective less intrusive.

On top that, masks classroom *do* impact learning. unambiguously, no-question, worth last school year, almost nobody access vaccine. people get vaccinated, schools require instead. people dying mRNA vaccines, since given vulnerable sub awhile (maybe is) invaded anti-lockdown anti-mask grifters awhile. masks. stopped wearing mine 2 weeks 2nd shot. times worn since Dr offices. keep car, I'm done wearing unless absolutely US least, don’t think another lockdown would tolerated listened to. cats bag now. work another field, meet frequently health people, absolutely touch behavior. 

IE, obesity number 1 issue (they know this) also want ban kids riding bikes getting exercise could get hurt. dont realize telling kids bikes super dangerous, theyve create lifelong couch potato.   Given &lt;50% nurses vaccinated themselves

Well great example. Wtf wrong people? Vaccines are, need people get them, 50% enough. evolved direction recently? got vaccinated Jan/feb found relatively solid resource, could see people “joining club” well becoming hot button topic could cause rapid evolution direction. Agreed. anti vax'ers, done caring happens point. Let get wiped out. World much better place without  gonna happen we've seen happens restrictions removed vaccinated, unvaccinated think means well. airlines going start checking vaccine cards see can't wear mask. Stop Sally deal hours.  exactly. I’d play Lottery work group solely fear they’d end winning without me. $2/week years throwing money away. Part issue decades Big Pharma made less wholesome business decisions US media called crony capitalists making morally bankrupt decisions. know lot people think pharma firms rushed vaccines profit cutting corners. think way people come around time. people see friends families developing long term effects think sizeable chunk people come around give vaccine strong consideration. media needs careful reports well. 999 scientists say based available evidence natural zoonotic origin likely, 1 says “well lab leak theoretically possible” “we can’t 100% rule lab leak”, reporting equal possibilities irresponsible misleading. US, plan Post Office deliver free face mask every home. think need elaborate never happened.  Reddit

Back claim graph data. Like UK has. Check IHME projections website, peak deaths UK mid-September.  Nobody lying. Data varied different parts world many reasons. Agreed. 2020 rough lot people. No, they're going it, eventually, overburdened medical facilities screw everything. medical facilities usually bigger cities, much rest economy based, well. 100% going without issues. dog pony show point. told upper leadership pass word Lower enlisted...sep 1st: mando military.  know unvaccinated? Young children. Please stop incredibly selfish. January 6th 2021 perfect example Looking forward Dim-sim run Marham. dammit kids eligible vaccine yet (9yo &amp; 11yo). Coastal Oregonian here... here... except mine always carry mask wear it. I'm old want sick damn young die. feel.   Darwin going save us. mostly kills old people past reproductive age. 

We fix stupid ourselves, nature going us. Note: I'm talking things like education laws/regulations. Would rather unlock, realise went fast undid sacrifice now? risk going bit slower far confident managing disease?

We already gone phased reopening final step normalising people's behaviour (removal masks, enabling people feel confident socialising again).

Following phased reopening, nearly 52k positive tests reported UK, double number two weeks ago. 

Now, whether people go die experience ill health another thing entirely. 

I believe scientists say vaccines work, know reasonable number people, may necessarily identify antivax, actually great level confidence vaccines job.

If believe vaccines bring deaths acceptable level (managing disease) - though specifics entirely different debate, *is* level deaths acceptable - *your* important metric must case numbers metric, nowhere near control.

And nowhere near control argument speed unlocking, fact need *lock* again. simply true Covid less dangerous kids flu. true all. Please don’t repeat lies internet, it’s people go deceived lie dangerous. 

As shutting society, one advocating that. one. advocate masks helpful. also advocate vaccines less densely crowded spaces - particularly kids. Since virus endemic, everyone that’s advocating vaccinated wear masks, also advocating “masks forever”. virus never going completely go away 30% population never getting vaccine.

Either accept whatever happens unvaccinated accord, wear masks live personal bubbles forever Zoom Happy Hour’s (Which even last year dumbest fucking thing I’ve ever heard of). pretty clear based data Israel releasing Pfizer significantly reduced efficacy infection symptoms Delta. prior efficacy 95%, new efficacy 60-70%, means 6-8X likely get infected before. definitely significant. 

Keep mind Israel first mass vaccinate. Antibody levels drop time, seeing precursor nations: combination mild vaccine evasion Delta combined natural decay active neutralizing antibodies due time since vaccination. 

It still relatively protective hospitalization death mediated B cells rather existing antibody levels. 

While bad news vaccinated folks, even worse unvaccinated folks. free-loading previously achieved herd immunity; longer case many vaccinated folks catch spread virus keep sustained community spread.  nrmally hate people correct people's typ0s, enjoyed weigh ewe it. But, isn't, people seem indicate it, like sort karmic justice.

There won't. Young unvaccinated people, majority, going get old people killed. get unvaccinated old people killed, vaccinated, they'll get killed. young unvaccinated people die far less often old vaccinated people.

What allowing evolutionary chaos. That’s possible origins, lab leak one *least likely*. much easier ways could happened, including numerous workers dealt wildlife meat trade getting exposed Guangdong bats animals act reservoirs are, getting infected, initiating super spreader event Wuhan. way would involve failures safety protocols, infected people going market starting super spreader event there. market? somewhere else, like hospital (if symptomatic) office lab even? know reports handful scientists lab symptoms something, given infectious COVID would expect many people lab infected, would evident. It’s much likely flu another respiratory virus, particularly bad prevalent world 2019-2020 season. overestimating mental capacity... folks may weak immune system isnt suitable to.be vaccinated.

Just clear, valid medical exemptions exist, people weakened immune systems *can* get vaccine -- real issue limited immune response there. I'm Welshman currently living NL.
We high vaccination rates well.
The Dutch government removed restrictions week bit ago- infections exploded R number exceeded peak values.

I want guys making mistake. Better spend money yourself, give Reddit. comment enough!    question really, hospitals state, person live anywhere near them?

If live nowhere near hospital, less populated area, probable bad local cases transferred/exported bigger cities.

Densely populated areas get cases, sure, also areas medical facilities treat serious cases. easy say COVID big deal see people know directly impacted. There's still real danger unvaccinated folks, though, long run.
. put things perspective ""gun"" deaths 60% really think makes sense compare self-inflicted death communicable disease. Lower viral load corresponding lower transmission COVID-specific phenomenon. well-documented principle infectious diseases generally. general rule thumb also makes sense intuitive level: less virus have, less effectively virus spreading — vice versa. 

But want COVID-specific example, here’s one think less absolutes nuance. It’s shouldn’t care asymptomatic infections vaccinated people, let many people get infected possible. It’s complex that. care, overly concerned fixated asymptomatic vaccinated cases something that’s necessarily harbinger doom. way, many, vaccinated people likely won’t get infected all. 

We know long COVID risk, again, likely one similarly mitigated vaccine — particularly reports people long COVID symptoms alleviated somewhat getting vaccinated. also know long COVID prevalent people severe cases — know vaccination dramatically decreases risk number severe cases, it’s stretch infer vaccine diminish risk number long COVID cases well. problem long COVID it’s amorphous ill-defined, encompasses vast array symptoms, affects different populations varying ways, it’s incredibly difficult pin quantify risks are, let alone prognosis. Here’s one resource worth reading  lot people going get already got ways. Ty, idea We've actually seen super-rural areas often eventually get higher rates COVID big cities.

It take longer get there. people still gather together, go one store 2 bars town, etc. gets there, bad. Yeah, Americans seeing ICU's close personal, want worry them. 

Best minimize risk take culling. good race.


/s   delayed managed delay getting hit Delta.

In case Ontario, Delta overwhelming majority (85%+) new cases now, yet they're still reporting roughly 150 daily, 14 million people living there. even months passed since study conducted, many things places reopened, Delta continuing push edge. eating outside yesterday like twenty minutes way people still far away, extreme wind, still concerned. Even though I'm fully vaccinated. Last time I'm while. Ok using gun logic need Covid battle Covid. Blow darts answer. Blow. Darts. Understandable. shocking see numbers laid out.

I'm greaful jabs, I've feeling would hospital 29% 55s USA believe global climate change serious threat lives times. voting behaviour every major country shows care bank account making drastic changes life style leaving us liveable planet. Ok done United States, restrictions unvaccinated. think people think “oh, don’t want Covid vaccine” choose stay willfully ignorant. However, don’t realize either get vaccinated get Covid. probably also believe Covid nothing cold.  first time I’ve seen percentage vaccinated people infected touted meaningful statistic own. There’s good reason that: simply isn’t.

Shameful headline. Ok hopefully lying talking study HK, use Moderna there, data Sinovac Pfizer/BNT.

But photo listed comment, Moderna highest antibody level. official name mRNA-1273, last point graph. Based graph antibody level almost 2 times Pfizer/BNT slightly lower efficacy.

I think general consensus higher antibody level, better protection. vaccines fit rule. However see one exception, CureVac. also mRNA vaccine antibody level similar BNT, Moderna. final trial efficacy 48%. Hope scientists figure reasoning behind this. last, accurate headline. We'll see happens, guess. said another thread, period most-vaccinated countries COVID surges *except* Israel, experts sort shrugged said vaccines good. Pfizer briefly allowed Israel country vaccinate way herd immunity, Delta changed that. we're still finding effective vaccines long. 

I believe (maybe all) vaccines still protect severe infection, matter, previous infection -- otherwise would seen massive confirmed reinfections everywhere got hit multiple variants. risk zero risk transmission almost certainly higher was.

The messaging tricky time, experts want us lose faith vaccines, also want vaccinated people act like they're invincible. problem is, course, vaccinated people (with vaccine all) know personal risk lowered, can't make take precautions used to.

Probably idea encouraging vaccinated hang vaccinated, form another, start come back (Israel already starting this). Insanity Problem need mandatory order get people vaccinated. case.

NO ONES!    Even vaccinated?

If vaccinated, there's nothing considered safe pandemic considered unsafe. network amongst themselves/ find jobs church groups know Delta impacting even Vaxed. punishing anyone stopping virus. republicans want kill Republicans? really dont get  COVID symptom good article measles big deal 100% constitutional mandate vaccines. Jacobson v. Massachusetts precedence local government mandate vaccines whether objections not.

Coalition Mercury-Free Drugs v. Sebelius says can’t challenge vaccine unsafe courts

Zucht v. King says it’s A-OK mandate schoolchildren.

Do want go on? people screaming vaccine mandates violate constitutional rights idea much power government comes public health.

Indeed according Israelies, 65% effective -D Israel mask mandates still going or? Schools going shut again. least, hope do. want kids middle that. California saw bigger change vaccination rates giving guaranteed $50 giving small chance win millions. neither made huge difference. Here’s thing though: nowhere US well vaccinated enough account contagious Delta is. isn’t relative metric antivax states, literally need 90%+ people vaccine current infection induced immunity. think 93% positive test results people symptoms getting tested? want on. Stupidity, mostly. experience.  Israel releasing data then? release statements claiming stuff real data England, Scotland, Canada etc shows reduction efficiency nothing major. 

The latest release PHE even showed decrease CFR Alpha Delta.

I hard time believing Israel say stuff without kind scientific evidence backing up. ain't. Hmm yeah see point retrospect. That's EUA is. 

There important difference hardcore antivaxx vs waiting approval though. say everyone know says closet antivaxxer they'll another excuse, aren't. get flu shots, MMR, works recommended. even democrats worried current vaccine batches developed previous administration wait full independent approval full stop. There's much gained stamping sheet paper saying ""approved"" even data date same.  Thank you. upvoted zero think it’s stupid fuck downvoted asking simple question. Thank asking it. years record many category organ long term damage. We've zero new cases nation's capital (Ottawa) last days. seem recall -1 new case one day, sure calculated...

And zero hospitalized covid ATM, keeping fingers good boy scout , cupcake Here's another article  Ya, reads like journalist implying 98% efficacy COVID vaccine good, especially vaccine provokes mild immune response. backfired Darwinism finest US hit 68% adults 1+ dose covid!

Based current rates, 3-4 weeks away 70%. fine fuck Fox news every time say something encourages people get vaccinated.   Bruh, I’m licking tables indoors point. never stopped wearing one. Might well try minimize risk however can. Vaccination KN95 mask means hopefully avoid anything.  What’s “Freedom Day” cringe  Household transmission nearly thing studied. know transmission studies vaccinated people feel free share - basically nothing else study one CDC cites. could also introduce new strains. Correction:

COVID accelerating deaths unhealthy health compromised citizens.

In grand scheme things, terrible say financially Covid might saving millennial generation bankruptcy Boomers end life health care expenses.

In next 20 years American medical expenses increase 300%    don’t know something like constitutional not, even was, wouldn’t work. scaring people getting vaxxed directly cause outbreak science? Also relatively people rural areas vaccinated. vaccines help cities vaccines work protecting disease seem effective reducing transmission. live 80% vaccinated two doses, works keep cases low neighborhood. It’s killing anti vaxxers. Americans. never end. Covid become endemic like measles H1N1.

Just look US, almost 100% hospitalizations severe cases people vaccinated. (with outliers course) breakthrough cases mild completely asymptomatic. Canada really lucked epidemiological timing. wave generally seems go SEA, Oceana, Europe/UK, US, Canada. 

This allowed vaccination program delay second doses ahead fourth wave which, hopefully us, ripple. bout faster fentanyl?

Now, think logic extended masks required medical settings, grocery stores, essential buisinesses.   Got :D hope mine manageable time (2nd dose) come!  Would say going eat outside table away people like twenty minutes half hour bad? Even vaccinated? Physicians greater 95 percent vaccination rate. Would nice US would conduct study variables, hopefully works.  issue, reason people keep failing see, labeling competing theories “conspiracy theories” - that’s science work. “Conspiracy theory” pejorative. Censoring articles, removing Facebook posts, disparaging scientists, putting lots power hands non-scientist “fact checkers” etc etc etc fundamentally non-scientific, hugely problematic, quite hypocritical given “trust science!” crowd happily regurgitating “conspiracy theory” insult. (That politifact retract “pants fire” entry lab leak hypothesis says something, doesn’t it?) It’s mob-mentality dangerous what’s supposedly science-driven free society. “The narrative become vaccines prevent infection transmission haven’t seen evidence accurate.” getting information? Even sub, several posts recent studies showing high efficacy infection prevention, even delta variant. mean, whole premise vaccines getting approved distributed clinical trials demonstrated ability prevent infection, prevent severe outcomes even greater degree still. 

Also, again, deal absolutes. never expectation vaccines going perfectly prevent cases totally eliminate transmission.

I didn’t see anything article 6 vaccinated members getting infected? even that’s true, even double number, 12 people small subgroup means representative broader environment large, ~150 million Americans fully vaccinated. also remember specific subgroup baseball players reflect reality people. players constantly traveling around country, constantly large crowded events, constantly close quarters dozens people, frequently tested, cases high profile. circumstances people. True. seems like survivability disease emphasized strongly fact lot people long-term/permanent effects. Plus children spread everything among other, immunosuppressed? understand sympathy vaccine refusers, since absolutely none, think I'll mask immunosuppressed solution problem. good bro, took vitamin C tabs morning. /s That's kids 5, school anyway.  cases still exist even vaccinated. UK 87% country single dose vaccinated 65% double yet 50,000 new cases today. even Oz vaccinated much UK still dealing lots cases gonna change strategy. However, age seamless cloning, synthetic genes etc., would naive dismiss impossible. Kids &lt;12 face many potential health challenges subsequent COVID made worse delta variant.

Source this. Especially data delta would nice.

Out 70654 unvaccinated ppl 50 years age exactly 21 died. UK data He’s talking vaccinated people test positive. LOT better unvaxxed people. shake magic ~~8~~ Q-Ball, turn over, see pops next. get better organically

If referring natural herd immunity, we've proven months *bullshit.*

Especially variants. Well that’s great, us kids can’t yet vaccinated &lt;12 yo can’t leave raise sort Lord Flies type situation either. It’s giant pool unvaccinated people fault own.  Evolution selects positive mutations, neutral bad mutations.

It's statistics game. virus lethal, tends kill hosts least make sick infect others confined. Plus virus new people tend distance take measures etc. selective pressure viruses kill quickly kill high rate people die spread them.

Not spread them, statistically speaking spread less. version causes less symptoms etc tends spread obvious reasons.

There tends overlap viruses strains one spreads quicker way actually vaccinates people bad strains.

This usually multiples causes bad strains hit load road blocks areas, weaker efficient strains dominate.

But mean applies universally, tends trend depends virus vectors many factors.

Given serious take covid, loosen restrictions gets safer. selective pressure virus cases go deaths remain open giving selective pressures mild faster spreading strains possible. combined vaccines etc. public messaging missed opportunity. real headline ""Alpha, Bravo, Charlie Variants Ropes. part defeat Delta - Get Vax'd."" tell us anything 2% immunized people infected control arm tell us percentage infected. wish happy reunion. They’re idiots. explanations around hesitancy don’t come play you’re drooling moron.

This nothing new way. saw 1918 we’ll see again. No. open pandoras box, inherit bunch liabilities. legally can't touch they'd business every employee gained right sue them. 2 weeks later, probably:

""Southern Nevada Health District requiring masks everyone public places""  tell people breakthrough case rare (which clearly not) give people false sense security.

The chances vaccinated person infected increase rise cases unvaccinated population, truer ever thanks Delta variant. one reasons why, early on, recommended vaccinated people associate freely vaccinated people. I’ve always wondered Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine frequently drops Oxford part. AstraZeneca big scary pharma company. Oxford world renowned bastion learning.

If absolutely chop name, Oxford vaccine. done Ontario lived Michigan, live Washington want go BC. I’ll take one hundred people genuine (good faith insane) fears one legit false information anti vaccine nut Ah yes, statement one guy gets repeated around world half-dozen studies saying opposite get ignored. 

If want make claim like *back data.*  one would prefer vaccine passports making everyone wear masks again? seems plausible spread delta could change this. 

So tired living “let’s wait see” new world. feel bad healthcare workers, kids get vaccinated, anyone would've otherwise gotten vaccine immunocompromised. anti-vaxxers refused get shot? Nah. karma. Google Robert F Kennedy Jr. He's one vocal antivaxxers there. There's significant amount crunchie hippies contribute movement.  want fall colour tour, need go Ontario/Quebec.   Jfc stick. jab whatever vaxx is. many nasty agenda types keep insisting absolutely good meanwhile they're 600 grand plus covid deaths country apparently never wrong. Morons work sent email go maskless you’re vaccinated. 120 people 500 showed vaccination 450 maskless. Zero chance casino guests listen ""advisory."" absolute value many sick vaccinated often misleading - be, unvaccinated sick, many serious condition? compare to, vaccinated, many serious condition? population far vaxxed people unvaxxed, outbreaks among vaxxed people that’s population. don’t know numbers specific instance, one possible explanation That's bad idea. Start sending embassies overseas countries low vaccine rates administered citizens, foreigners work embassy, etc. I’m this, still need system enforcement Guessing one captain tomato's friends. arms this? personally know 3 people can’t get vaccine different reasons: one pregnant, one auto-immune disorder third allergic reactions one ingredients. even 20% population, probably not. “argument” simply reminding OP it’s 100% vax refusers, true regardless actual number. you’re vaccinated thankful relax man one trying start fight here. Check Netherlands! Makes sense, thank taking time explain me! Thank you! It’s really hard reading nasty things people say unvaccinated. horrible medical anxiety. I’m scared covid vaccine. I’m going get mine tomorrow, getting job back summer depends it. Part excited wont worry dying covid part could vomit shit time anxiety reaction knows line. (Yes know chances less getting struck lightening 3x) Anxiety doesn’t make sense. everyone asshole. people scared. leave though. goes Vegas stays Vegas.  Link? study said 93% effectiveness hospitalization Absolute nonsense. Recovering disease means virus unable reproduce body immune system learned counteract it.

If someone recovers, immune contracting Covid least several months, likely years (like SARS 2003). worried potential long term side effects vaccine? one receive? Yep, Zero Covid train long left station. going get it, version it, point, better vaccinated agree makes infection less severe. example, none players infected Yanks/Sox serious case. constant cycle yearly booster shots, basically forever. That’s cool, states would willing mandate won’t need high rates states don’t want won’t it. [data starting Associated Press analysis available government data May shows “breakthrough” infections fully vaccinated people accounted fewer 1,200 107,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations. That’s 1.1%.

There's also far cases South, far North West, many infected areas [divided along political course vaccine 100% effective, that's reason doctors calling everyone try get it, herd immunity. seen conflicted reports this. think found 64% effective others somewhere 75-88%.  lol governing Liberals also hedged bets ordering doses promising vaccines last year, rather gamble one two. opposition decried waste money time, rollout earlier year far behind nations like UK US, shut real fast vaccine rollout went stratospheric Delta starting ravage world.

Canada already leads world percentage population least one jab (since month ago), overtake US third spot next day two, according ourworldindata. called Pfizer vaccine? 100% research majority manufacturing done Biontech; Pfizer helps tests, US red tape manufacturing. worst Biontech/Pfizer. That's amazing marketing. change approval method specifically mark approved, think going lose lot confidence going gain.

I would understood Democrats hesitant first country approve developed nation hadn't. first ones approved US widely approved elsewhere, much liberal countries. I'll listen nurses recommendations 90% nurses vaccinated.

I'm vaccinated. Covid refuse put mask back on. far I'm concerned, point, weeding stupid country. think that's good thing.    CNN seems saying something different I'm sure difference is. Bloomberg, says ""putting track potential full approval early next year."" CNN, wording ""a decision full approval likely come within two months."" 

Are talking different things one articles extremely wrong? Diplomacy ass. jab em simple look face thing know humann don’t know “severe” risk. would certainly protected got vaccine. lots controlled studies effectiveness vaccines. don’t kind data natural immunity previous exposure. Plus delta variant throws another wrinkle mix don’t know about. Ah yes, “idiot” asked source unsubstantiated claim. Please go on. small kids vaccine age yet. delta really got going decided rent house beach week summer coming up. I'm overly concerned beach, windy outdoors, house concerns bit since know us. 

I'll sanitize high traffic areas, steps take make sure things great kids? Maybe open windows turn fans arrive? I'm walking fine line paranoid air conditioning, etc... thinking non-issue. skewed. [CDC publishes breathrough 791 COVID-related deaths July 12. need go early March death rates less half peak &lt; 1% deaths. 

They also published [summary March 132 COVID-related deaths. less 700 vaccinated deaths 30,000 people died COVID May 1 July 12. I’m at. It’s conflicting. friend went family vacation. Low behold came back covid. 10 adults (all vaxxed) 3 kids (all 12). 2 adults tested positive along 1 kid. said sister showed trip sniffles didn’t think anything suspect brought along. 3 individuals recovered there’s huge positive. 

We friend go girls trip Mexico. 18 vaxxed. 13 positive.

I’m sitting like damn… don’t want get sideline life 2 weeks. Yes, learn live wonder ever become like respiratory illnesses feel better rejoin society? negative test required? Learn read articles bro. Straight likely approved til Jan 2022. blessed day. dad cut seatbelts truck started making standard new vehicles. Good one [It must however noted cases reinfections rather rare event even reinfection occur, case usually mild asymptomatic. problem. forgot mention “old”. 16yr old niece twice. hospital twice, 4 months part. So, definitely true. fiancés friend 3 times. (She care family members it.) I've heard people multiple times. Wish simple. Exactly. Thank you. infants kids don’t fully developed immune system, could imagine may true due less “cytokine storm.” thinking kids ages 5-12, appear true then. Further, case-level risk (what happens you’re sick) population-level risk (what chances getting sick x threat posed infection). would guess Covid still poses population-level risk &lt;5 year olds due higher infectivity risk flu. 

“However, serious COVID-19 illness resulting hospitalization death occur even healthy young children”  people want communist dictatorship… democracy data isreal taken grain salt. don’t believe study published effectiveness vaccine variants isreal. study Canada concluded Pfizer high 80s delta variant Ok gosh ya big stinker! 

I talking full FDA approval shot given 16’s, EUA approval. recommend staying date news ya stinker, won’t look silly. Better hope lib'ral city county, (such LA). know Rogan came discussion, think ""listen surgeons"" sound advice epidemy.  

You listen mRNA researcher remove bladder either. sad, silver lining: vaccination rates rise one way another. One doesn’t negate other.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   gives hope, San Diego County specifically addressed LA County announcement said currently plans reintroduce mandatory masks *their* county.

I'm worried liberal cities, however, New York City, Boston, Raleigh. look mirror got both! -1 zero new cases day minus case incorrectly included local public health unit back May. unfortunate quirk daily data presented, data correction potentially hide true number new daily cases.   I’ve 3 non-COVID colds since vaccinated Jan/Feb. (the joys toddler daycare).

I’ve colds postviral symptoms months (pneumonia/bronchitis, fatigue, etc). happens. isn’t necessarily COVID. need get tested know. reach herd immunity, concern variants diminish significantly. Problem we're yet, antivax crowd helping.

It depressing. beat back variant get vaccination rates up, shed masks good. I'll take temporary inconvenience mask permanent disability. individual even mentioning large protests French people mandates mentioned. hero, oppressor, rise you. said behave like bacteria do. People spreading idea virus trying change evade vaccine. antivax disinfo. sure that's anti vaxxers? see plenty people opposite spectrum want us stay locked forever think covid 0 realistic. people live remote areas accessibility public transportation Incorrect. Stop spreading misinformation. give EUA use Pfizer vaccine children mid winter. preclude full approval age groups earlier. drives high. Hopefully prioritize EUA U12 age group well. delays could problematic delta surge coincides kids returning schools, many (most?) districts forgoing mask mandates. ""Recommended"" means many ""good wear mask."" ate inside crowded mask less restaurant last weekend hour. fine outside. DRAMATIC!!!!

Like requiring vaccinations benefit public health?

Oh, no, would infringe 'rights' people complete fucking morons. I’m asking media “support” anything dolt. I’m saying it’s dangerous label scientific theories “conspiracy” science still unsure research done. God damn man, really fucking dense?  realize canada different country likely turned away checkpoint passport lol  see positive really; getting suffering? Folks ignore science feel know better. Sometimes reality slap around bit.   never achieved herd immunity without vaccinating disease, even smallpox highly virulent. Without vaccinating appropriate level, would never reach endgame covid. would mostly republicans point?  Good coming terms reality unlike cities US still think get zero cases restrictions. Exactly! continue put restrictions duty giving pass screaming rights. ass backwards ineffective. may protect asymptomatic infection mild cold strong preventative effect severe disease.

The vaccines protect infection, rate people want to. talking last night! concern Delta. I’m fully vaxxed, living life, realize covid stay. 

I’m wondering it’ll ever treated like respiratory illnesses feel better longer symptoms go back life. 
with social events traveling starting back 14 day quarantine really sucks. Likely provide reference vs now. However graph seems misleading ways. Notice blue bars represent monthly totals covid black bars *daily averages* deaths. Unless I'm reading data incorrectly, would mean extrapolating monthly totals black bars would result much larger monthly covid deaths shown here. Please correct I'm   point like think we're strengthening gene pool. I’m trying snarky. CDC made guidance according data variants including Delta, even immune evasive strains Beta, made decision reason. Science evolve, also means PCR tests adjusted disregard low viral load vaccinated people, something else measure contagiousness. catches on, testing vaccinated people events become meaningless walking restaurant mask taking sit table.

My point is, everyone else vaccinated, reason stall normal life vaccinated likely threat. Nobody gets tested flu entering events, next strain flu bigger threat vaccinated people Covid is.  I’m fully vaccinated still wear 2 masks. sadly know people don’t wear mask refuse get vaccinated. almost impossible tell hasn’t vaccinated. agree explain indian vaccine comepletly different name? covishield astra? leaning towards opinion posting comment rereading again. normal deadline 6 months (January), since way data normal, expedited bit, especially public interest. two months, assuming run additional problems, 6 months.

I thought would get approval sometime month May submission. 1) one dose 40 vulnerable hospitalisation way. 

2) PHE analysis real world data agree it’s effective case people aren’t going overwhelm healthcare system. I’ve never heard someone three x. person three positive PCRs get sick ? though?   vaccination rates high among population actually goes i.e. young people. Dutch government opened nightclubs failed vaccinate demographic would using them. That's smart opening nursing home visitations without vaccinating seniors. 

And looks like similar mistake made England, young people prioritized vaccination. I'm huge fan England's age-based vaccine roll-out, first-come-first-served 50's demographic done.    90% vaccinated. ~66% adults gotten 2 doses. first time happened?   state set date time covid vax based voter rolls, mail people letter saying 'It's responsibility show appointment time. leave cancel. Getting appointment set half battle... I'm glad vaccines work, yay! :) sure now, beginning pandemic vaccines even US came Europe.   

But anyway, nobody calls Foxconn iPhone, right? clearly can’t fucking read. conclusion article cherry picked:

“To day, definitive evidence whether virus occurred naturally origins lab, hypothesis Wuhan facility source increasingly mainstream science behind longer ignored.”

The rest article, take time read it, lays much scientific evidence lab leak theory. see decided quote parts aren’t convenient narrative. Nice. 

Also, lastly, keep suggesting I’m arguing lab leak theory true. I’m not. don’t give shit it’s true not. I’m talking conversation around theory. I’m talking gaslighting. I’m talking rampant censorship. don’t get that, you? assume don’t get you’re idiot, can’t spell clearer you. Thank you! Hoping stays way!!  Nordic Council copyright nordicness. 
Nordic Council nordic EU europe USA america. 
The original meaning 'nordic' Bottomlands (of Baltoscandian glacier). look maximum glacial extent googling. 99.9% covid deaths adults, ones dying definitely unvaccinated choice. guess people really bad side-effects. think need address this, I'm pro-vax even I'm wondering. looks bad silence looks even worse.  get whole freaking wear mask. selfish basically tells worth time, air breathe, speak you. I'm rude hell people enter bubble without mask. showing respect, shall show well. Bloomberg $400/year?!? fuck paying that?? many infections kids lung term physical neurological complications virus?

There outcomes ""dead"" ""totally fine."" can't wait vaccines tied employment.

These unvaccinated fucks ruining everyone. here. makes wonder restrictions placed people take something else nearly serious COVID vaccine. Imagine restrictions placed us chose go w/o smartphone (or rooting one have), one fell behind bill something. country like China could easily impose stuff like &amp; population agree (or pretend - see social credit system).  many people look things binary sense, 1 0. That's works. slowly taper regulations vaccinate population see things go. nothing. people want masks life also realize might smart stay masked bit figure next stage pandemic. doomer denying science completely rational. 

Just we'll live virus forever mean we're ready deal full capacity right now. means need find treatments learn virus prepare live forever. point think glad looking argument find one here. 👋🏻  Right, almost forgot. various vaccines combined, ordered like 10 doses every one person. Herd immunity arrive eventually. long takes depend vaccine uptake, certain elements best slow down.    I've noticed people read papers like Sun vastly likely maskless say someone reads gurdian.

Dear me, sound good considering readership Sun 10x Guardian. Yea sympthay anymore deaths unvaccinated idiots. ones can't get vaccine. actually pretty good. I'm fully vaccinated weeks can't wait get rid anxiety I've past 15 months. neighbour vaccine twice still symptoms getting vaccine. 23.5yr old cousin vaccine also mild symptoms.  explicitly de-prioritized previously infected people receiving vaccine - recovered patients aren’t accounted future studies (ie remain “unvaccinated” group) prior immunity makes unvaccinated vaccinated group appear similar thus vaccine less effective  ""In psychology human behavior, denialism person's choice deny reality way avoid psychologically uncomfortable truth"": FDA's stance COVID vaccines? Since regard highest authority, accept judgment assume. 

Start fda.gov can't find anything Facebook.  going say surprising UK pretty good. 

Though questioned waited two weeks 19th lift restrictions everything going well. Would agree he's one sensible voices throughout pandemic, there's undoubtedly conflict interest Pfizer's BOD. don’t know believe anymore. Pfizer ramming booster trials they’ve said they’re asking EUA even trial begins (I’m get Tuesday). I’m Phase III trials they’re dissolving replacing booster study, why? one first get vaccine area end month I’ll 12 months, they’re scrapping 1-year testing…What hell going on? Hey buddy, take easy. It’s Reddit. don’t get worked up. Everything going OK 🙂 Stupid people listen anyone. That's makes stupid. Yea that's illegal, report him. get license plate report road saw get car high. both.  Right, infection rates rural areas lower. asked vaccination stats saying suspect also lower rural areas cities. need test 150 million vaccinated people, need consistent testing least vaccinated individuals determine common asymptomatic Covid infection vaccinated individuals is. original Pfizer control group efficacy studies released data testing symptomatic participants Covid, that's know vaccine effective preventing severe outcome symptomatic Covid cases.
""Pfizer provide details analysis asymptomatic infections. previous unpublished study health ministry Pfizer, Israeli researchers said study needed asymptomatic transmission among people fully vaccinated less likely Israel tested COVID-19."" It’s always “just months” isn’t it. really believe that? delta variant enough bring masks back, whatever variant comes next big concern. way life stay.    Old. think then, thibk saying? isnt manufacturing us made pfizer biontech located europe use production there? guess use name manufacturing company.

I think reason indian vaccine also different name Oh look, typical vacuous reply asked actually present sources. I'll grab ticket jackpot extra high otherwise no. proving point vaccine much virus. 

I least three times, one shitty hell two times like bad cough test positive negative multiple tests every week sick 9 months.  one hit close home?  I'm curious predictions made spot on? WA side border? I've met WA/BC couples since moving curious that's story well 😁 LA County mandate include kind metric needs hit end, la California statewide county tier system? Uh-huh, right. u/daveyboy197171 clearly real expert here.
The sensible thing would throw caution wind, right? false info eyes I'm saying immediately going back normal? new mask mandates put back place discouraging. Part reason getting vaccine show people get back normal. vaccinated people also mask again, help convincing unvaccinated get jab complain also wear mask. mess. Yeah I’m fine adults choosing vaccinate mask dying point. vaccinated continue mask protect children legitimately can’t get vaccine. begun tbh let’s send kids back school masks meantime? Real ID passed 2005 probably won’t go effect travel 2023. think roll another National ID within short enough timeframe would matter? problem shot guarantee, vaccinated person still spread it.  
Social responsibility like masking public indoor places common sense situation. live I'm masked person see go places. masks used PPE; misuse term. voted him. Kinda feel like CDC way short sighted things (almost like previous admin). tracking non-hospitalized breakthroughs BIG misstep. isn't, takeaway here.

High vaccination rates increase herd immunity. good. mean immediately unlock everything throw open country nothing matter.
Vaccinations restrictions work tandem.
Vaccines reduce spread existing variants, restrictions reduce risk new variants. time come gone. It’s time focus efforts eradication, mitigation. required percentage local population vax.  First, thank answering.

IMO that's one two possible arguments (the preserve hospital capacity, believe issue outside low-vax areas).

But also believe, strong certainty, pandemic scenario children exactly risk now, everyone else society also risk children now, we'd never single shut down, single capacity restriction, single mask mandate. fully believe for-the-children argument knee jerk reaction truly dangerous risk adults, valid fear we've lived past year+. I'm fully vaxxed wear mask see employees majority people inside wearing them. I'm protected, science side I'm going spread covid.atthus point social signal make people feel comfortable. Quit spreading false information. something else life. Omg that’s awesome. Forever call Covid patriot cough 😂😂😂 got Moderna, really surprised felt fine minus sore arm days after, seems like people’s reactions vaccines essentially random don’t really mean anything people saying clamoring success warp speed….are ones basically throwing success away. I'm done masks. wore one year I'm done. covid kills me, well something it. Maybe Nurses could good getting vaccinated. opinion, caregiver refuses vaccination fired. employ sued socks.

More need universal masking. Top tip: don’t call arbitrary date freedom day you’re trying control pandemic. states vaccine lotteries work out? Seems like could much cheaper way incentive people. peoplr would go ""chance win million"" vs given $10 (even though could turn around buy lottery ticket $10). thing news lot people… Brand new IHME projections show UK deaths peaking mid-September. rather pedantic point, one might generally expect higher standards yet inoculated hurry get jabbed avoid affecting child's return school,"" read notice posted Guangxi province earlier week, adding ruling applied students technically province rather 'autonomous region'.

Additionally, linked notice covers one city Guangxi, opposed entire region, though similar measures quite likely throughout China. I'm fucking tired. spent year everything could, social distancing, masking up, staying home, getting vaccinated, etc

And many people care. want single thing stop spread. spread insane conspiracy theories. I'm fucking tired losing respect friends family. Ahhhh see found high school rivals hidden among social medias!! 

#Go Bears! Thank Scottish literally responding commenter concern obviously around whether vaccinated person transmit disease even studies seem show viral load vaccinated person well someone unvaccinated.

And yes vaccines great concern working nearly well couple months ago new variants. original situation much better much. I'm torn it, too.

If available yet there's legit medical issue (like vaccines available area include ingredients trigger allergies, etc), ain't mad someone. 

If someone flatly refusing, like ""cool, told ass. get sick, that's goddamn fault.""

But public health thinking kicks in. First, may spread kids. kids deserve shit. may also spread others, vaccinated people, odds very, small, personally wanna sick shitbird want vaccinated. really want spreading medical professionals.

The big suck unvaccinated people perfect place variants spawn. add additional strain healthcare systems. they're rural, small medical systems may capacity, skill, equipment handle them, end city hospital. city hospitals crowded COVID cases addition rural cases. 

That's lot strain bed personnel capacity. That's less capacity everyday things.

This also means expenses pushed hospital healthcare system, means end paying it.

And shitbird look outside information circle, knows better still vaccinated. 

If unvaccinated individual seeing consequences, care. they're also passing bill everyone else, too. nice. Please report comments like rather engage. So...increasing vaccination rates bad thing?

You said need high vaccination rates vaccinations also pressure virus make new variants? would make vaccination pointless.  you? anyone thread? 
*Argumentum ad verecundiam* logical fallacy reason. There’s two options make sense. wear masks prove you’re vaccinated. lot adult babies don’t like that’s way out. honor system bullshit makes seriously question decision making skills everyone CDC. They’ve trying manipulate public it’s pathetic counter productive. countries get vaccine passport enter, embassy. Article (In Israel):

The Health Ministry asked health maintenance organizations get ready vaccinate children 12 serious pre-existing conditions, reports Channel 12 News.

A limited number youths 12 years old received Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination. directive, yet finalized Health Ministry, would expand figure set precedent rest world.  that, still getting bunch new cases now. People concerned this. gotta say, really blame possible re-introduction mask mandates CDC.

Why, sub alone, would downvoted oblivion suggesting mid-2020 it’s suddenly ok so? Vaccinations effective variant, guess depend different employers feel number employees vaccinated, wearing masks. Given children can't vaccinated yet, important people insure kids wearing masks indoors public places. vaccinated? Totalitarianism, discrimination, two-tier society's. 

Sounds like Europe 1940s That’s binary view incredibly fluid nuanced environment. 

Vaccines aren’t bullet proof (see U.K. Navy ship HMS Queen Elizabeth fully vaccinated crew spread occurring onboard) we’ve hard things long time. doesn’t mean pandemic over.

Houston Methodist required employees get vaccine, ended firing like 165 25,000 employees. 

People need kick ass. Biden require federal employees get it. Put pressure hospitals taking Medicaid aid require this. 

We past point politely asking.   here, let Biden keep sending us money I’ll stay home. 100K worse even really bad flu season. go back 1950s 1960s find flu seasons high death toll. know rest world isn’t anywhere close vaccinated? may want travel don’t want delta variant.  Try make us!! thing people understand science works even believe it.   guess it’s possible, however unlikely, states *may* short sporadic lockdowns, doubt — whatever form new lockdowns take, won’t like pre-vaccine lockdowns. point, we’ll likely 70% adults least one dose (already 68% today), we’ll 80% 65+ vaccinated (79% today), we’ll surpassed 50% total population (48% today) fully vaccinated. majority people vaccinated, supermajority adults vaccinated, hypermajority adults 65 (by far highest risk) vaccinated. scenario, it’s still plausible raw case numbers continue rise, outcomes aren’t severe majorities mentioned, situation isn’t nearly dire pre-vaccine. like flu season vaccinated.

It’s also probably feasible politically. states likely need lockdowns (states low vaccination rates) also states least likely impose — vice versa. way, even state impose lockdown, still well protected vaccinated. Herd immunity delta variant absolutely possible…but it’s estimated 85% population double vaccinated. means children 12 vaccinated. fact we’re yet doesn’t mean it’s impossible. sure opening everything allowing cases surge unvaccinated best humane way get there. would also like see age health condition dying hospitalized fully vaccinated, wouldnt shock older or.immun compromised getting full effects vaccine No. Kids prone severe disease going get vaccinated huge numbers see 12-16. don’t want kids exposed don’t take public spaces.

'we' mean 'the entire United States', I'm sure herd immunity ever happen. already difficult older variants, Delta infectious thus requires higher % total population immunized. also seems Delta, full vaccination important older variants one shot already highly effective. Across entire US, 45% people fully vaccinated, herd immunity want 60-70% least. also clear Delta variant affects percentage. fact infectious may mean harder suppress transmission. people individually protected vaccine likely get sick, virus might still able circulate.  think worked well.

People separated year unscientific travel bans much point. majority people want live restrictions 0 covid, we'd lockdown forever then. people realize still cases plague? pretty much impossible covid thing anymore. 

Obviously, things great UK rn, things feel comfortable with. think lot people become really risk averse. current death rate UK worse flu despite high case numbers.

I immediately removed isle waited leave return.

I also find majority people wear masks seem builders, contractors young. Also I've noticed people read papers like Sun vastly likely maskless say someone reads gurdian.

It mostly educational issue believe now, people misinformed &amp; genuinely dicks.

I think 50-60% wear masks store time now, still relatively good.

Outside same, one really cares outside they've taken boris speech like words god, understand reduces eliminates chances.

Vaccines seems popular though, especially brainless bunch, holiday fear really made go get one, whole passport scheme thing real genuinely genius push get it.

I got vaccinated protect fellow man virus. Whether personally would still need mask afterwards point future factor decision. already bet Pro-Gun crowd gonna use this.

Yeah, I'm really interested see last wave marks true end pandemic UK. likely hit 80-90% range natural + vaccination immunity passes. historical reasons vaccination RSV challenge. MRNA vaccines might offer us solution problem. far common colds? It’s technically possible, practically. hundreds different stereotypes human rhinovirus alone. would give people vaccines hundreds different viruses order eradicate common cold. I’m Texas. It’s hospital, it’s community outpatient clinic offers mental health medical services. Staff wear masks patients aren’t required, “recommended.” mental health intakes, I’m sitting office one one sometimes 2 hours patients. got ok ask wear masks I’ve getting push back. decided switch work home baby instead since won’t enforce it. physically cannot get vaccine. care immunocompromised choice matter. prepared wear mask potentially rest life? covid going away sounds like trust vaccines.

So giving masks annoying? received vaccine soon able to.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well, reason England reopening government believes NHS longer risk high vaccination rates.

And you’re misrepresenting point second paragraph. ad hoc restrictions didn’t mean lockdowns, meant things like reintroduction mask mandates, distancing mandates, arbitrary capacity socializing limits, etc. lockdowns last resort. seems like pretty horrific cycle people’s livelihoods. state in? healthcare workers working hospital without masks? Upvoting you. might early spread covid among vaccinated people know, current impression spread among vaccinated considerably underestimated people moment. numbers great dying vaccine, know multiple people Pfizer jabs who've really unpleasant symptoms getting delta. 

You also correct vaccines definition put selective pressure virus evade defenses vaccinated people.  People aware number Coronavirus cases increased 49 states correct?  Lake Moraine, I’ve missed you.  herd immunity? wrong say Delta variant hitting summer would expect lowest cases opposed Delta hitting winter? know they’ll future variants tracking closer immunity vaccines natural, no?  Meanwhile, co workers saying ""meh"" vaccine cases steadily climbing locally, heading breathe hundreds customers day. I’m done caring, got vaccinated Oh, save pearl clutching. Vaccines required school attendance decades.  Yes, upvote. Citizens responsibility mindful others around them. That's civilisation first place. want vaccinate selfish, self-absorbed views die stop spreading covid19 danger everyone else around you. Nearly 88% adults one dose, 67% double-jabbed (I add figure tomorrow).

You""d hard-pressed find nation kind levels. sounds entirely unreasonable. real issue trying wrap head around fact Chinese people actually choice whether get vaccinated… Laymen always feel things predictable simple. Ikr prepared wear mask potentially rest life? covid going away sounds like trust vaccines. don’t increase much mRNA vaccine. important thing isn’t antibodies. important thing think immune system whole.

When antibody response like that, immune system takes number cells produce antibodies, well cells capable looking inside cells tell whether infected, files away. way, run virus 10 years later, 40 years later, memory immunity. cells pulled storage start producing large amounts antibodies within 12 hours. cells multiply rapidly begin hunting infected cells. result might get little bit sick, won’t get sick. Whatever motivate people most. past year half, autonomous regions provinces follow quickly covid related rules. Every level government bureaucracy quickly follows restrictive measures it’s implemented nearby. 

Let’s see happens here. ""normal"" hospitals start filling affecting everyone's healthcare industries start getting staff shortages people scared come work. remember family relatives back 80s 100% seat belt laws passed around time. lost son rollover accident thrown vehicle wearing seatbelt. Utterly tragic.  Seriously, idk what’s people here. Callous is, chosen get vaccine actively making bed.

You cannot expect others bear unvaccinated burden forever. Quoted study March June 2021 India experienced deadly second wave COVID19 increased number post vaccination breakthrough infections reported across country. understand possible reason breakthroughs collected 677 clinical samples (throat swab/ nasal swabs) individuals received two doses (n=592) one dose (n=85) vaccines (Covishield Covaxin,) tested positive study indicated majority clinical cases breakthrough infected Delta variant 9.8% cases required hospitalization fatality observed 0.4% cases. clearly suggests vaccination provide reduction hospital admission mortality.

Overall 9.8% hospitalisation rates 0.4% deaths among cohort exactly good news, although almost certainty issues group selection, since people symptoms far likely get tested.    say true. point simply there's lot previous government could done would perfectly constitutional. Measles gone away, suitable numbers people vaccinated people never think unless local outbreak.

Before chicken pox vaccine, constant concern people. would go around community peter ran vulnerable hosts. 

Eventually, get covid. question many people get sick get there. fairly calm.

I think prepared pretty big numbers much lower effect.

Im 30 second jab 2 weeks time. mean, they’re following US’s lead so…  70 cycles per day hear back. It’s kind fault die Covid now, though. Obviously immune compromised people US adult population).  Except Delta dangerous children 12 previous variants far know. get urgency, like scores children dying meantime. still get infected spread people ""done part."" hospitalization rate gets high like early days pandemic

At present central issue regarding policy least UK, Israel (and likely soon states). lot people lifting lockdowns data currently shows correlation hospitalizations cases much different pre vaccination. look chart, yes accounts ""lag"". Hence getting harder harder support ""invasive"" preventative measures.

It's going long road people raging risk assessment tolerance simply align others. many people states have, going varying degrees assessments. Hence argue localized approaches opposed federal mandates.  kids. Irrelevant question.  question is: we’ve seen like what, 5 6 variants concern *this year alone*? billions people won’t get option vaccinated like 2023/2024? 

No one ever really talks but, it’s like 150MM people really making difference terms mutations still billions unvaccinated billions won’t vaccinated least another year.  half eligible population, take account includes first second doses, yeah, quarter eligible humans fully vaccinated. assumption there’s finite amount risk there’s variable amount risk. “ripping bandaid getting with” may carry benefit six months goalposts moved new variant.

The calculus changes time new variant concern comes greater transmissibility immune escape. Great example 95% reduction infection mRNA vaccines high 70% range delta. going hear small percentage times someone gets sick vaccinated get reaction. Nobody saying vaccine working them. 

The odds get ill (i.e. strong cold) vaccinated low.  Yes. would great. many would taken advice. 

But states would obligation follow recommendations 
of task force governors I’m pretty positive would’ve chosen too. something knew would happen, look data also zero doubt see rise correspond locations low vaccination rates don’t know country you’re there’s probably lot countries could travel right think.  California already got rid religious exemption it’s held federal court. that, California system tracking doctors write medical exemptions. write five year, department health close look them. course, you’re pediatric oncologist exceptions legitimate, nothing happens. certain pediatrician Orange County writing bogus exemptions based fraudulent information, something definitely happens. Efficacy mrna vaccines extremely high terms death/hospitalization also getting sick all. 

At end day there's small chance get covid vaccinated, let alone hospitalized die. That's CDC even recommend fully vaccinated person get tested isolate exposed someone covid. dumbest shit ever read. want deny people access care vaccinated? sub turned into? Probably what's going us, definitely sucks regardless! guardian woke media steroids. mainstream paper US comes close English Tory hatred guardian  Maybe employees visitors? think unreasonable that's case. said forever?!?

Why making shit up? Nobody saying forever, nobody saying lockdowns life. 

I want go back normal seems like best way better control virus spread place.

Its use Washington name whole USA.  *choose* vaccinate vulnerable. 

I'm immunocompromised. fully vaccinated, antibodies. research far says people like middling results, there's significant percentage us respond vaccine. 

And get vaccine. transplant, auto-immune disorder, even worse trying get vaccinated on. I'm also old enough get it, 12 cannot right now. 

All us still vulnerable, point. looked CDC stats today surprised high covid rate among Asians considering ready compliance mask wearing.  say refuse ICU care. made choice.    I'm specifically saying state government like CA mandate vax passports little fallout. 

What's concern pro-vax state? legally, mean tell outright requirement citizens get vaccinated legal Jacobson, system check vaccination status would be?? Malta: Average 0 deaths daily since april

It's mostly youth, doesnt affect much, always known

the narrative shifted case obsession, cares cases virus pretty much inert now.

The vulnerable vaccinated, vaccine works protecting them, now. soon accept is.  *Natural selection super-liked this* Don’t come it’s trash. Go SD Santa Barbara something concern incoming variants increased infection rates vaccinated individuals? beloved Alberta, lives Vancouver  Taking train problem. got screwed community came you. 

Rather buckle needed done end this, community decided try bare minimum get by. happened? Nothing solved, faded slightly got kicked road bit.

Don't like elders. better. needs done people counting **you** get screwed too. told apes whole time.  Blue Jays believe got J&amp;J AZ wasn’t accepted US, one got Covid ago. hear saying, far science goes, completely correct. think may missing point ""doomerism."" 
You responded statement someone expressing hopelessness with, mind, hope. feel hope, though tempered.

We two cases deal - specific interlocutor people general.

This particular person experienced tremendous loss probably place accept hopeful information. need support time. responsibility provide either those, arguably human expectation ought understand.

In terms people general, pandemic demonstrated clearly poorly people understand calculate risk. Many, people, already believe risk serious illness death Covid vanishingly low. many cases, largely correct. dangers long Covid also poorly understood amorphous time.

The point I'm making (in far many words) people lack hope hoping simply survive - hoping pre-Covid normalcy. Parties. Pot-luck dinners. Nights pub watching sports cheering home team sampling other's craft brews. School sports, without masks. Seeing people's faces. 

So far, vaccines can't that. population anti-vax reduced, current vaccines may become ineffective even made available countries bulk. entire population unvaccinated becomes petri dish. 

All I've mentioned news social media daily (depending echo chamber choice), beginning severely degrade many people's mental emotional well-being.

The vaccines, miracles are, cannot touch problem despair directly. Coordinated human effort, including vaccines, needed restore hope.

My two cents.

Edits clarity, copied previous, incorrectly-placed, reply page. We’re side you’re going needlessly fearmonger spread potentially dangerous misinformation. Claiming “strains” evade vaccine without evidence telling people dose things like melatonin without sufficient scientific proof cover angles. You’ve lot tonight.     let go live. isnt hill want die      get it. mask. people feel like imprisoned. Im vaccinated still wear mask go out. big deal lol I’m actually little disturbed easily husband picking little colds starting go grocery store Costco. wear masks still (and fully vaccinated) sanitize cart handles hands, still seem get little bug without fail. Makes question effective really masks sanitizing :/ hopefully never. suggesting government force every business enforce this?

They're authoritarian course do. Yes making fun people chemotherapy admirable. mom must proud. needs many outweigh needs few. got vaccinated reason. Wearing masks nuisance. You’re lying say wearing masks normal part human life.  I'm still vaccinated it. whole pandemic exposed humanity vile pit scum selfishness. 

For try insist ""most people inherently good,"" I'd like point masking vaccination rates. epitome *inherently good* right turned naked litmus test, we're failing.  Lmao  Like: medical religious exemption, placed one negative pressure tubes back classroom must wear full PPE leaving tube. Also, subject daily Covid testing become infection following protocol, put probation.
 I'm silly get point unvaccinated people uncomfortable due strict requirements them. odds mutating spreads low. Lear spread enough odds mutates become exceedingly high. Covid still spreading high rates. I'm 1.5 years. Meanwhile sit Reddit crying wearing mask. Get real.  That's comforting! might low dose, could blow-dart-itize vaccine?

Could considered crowd control compliance tool, like, ""disperse pull vaccine""?/s Great!! point reopening try get tiny amount goodwill reopen crowd hopes would lead better compliance inevitable next lockdown. I'm argue you. We're probably side things. relax friend. 

My significant use account. job. Sorry confusion. A&amp;W Third Pounder! focusing household transmission? fact mRNA vaccines prevent 80%+ symptomatic covid cases?  Colds RSV running rampant right now.  don’t know relevancy has, didn’t Yankees get JnJ? [Viruses tend mutate become *less* said, killing host good strategy. Viruses want kill us want live inside us. fact originated China already stirred racism. ""Vaccine effectiveness preventing infection symptomatic disease fell 64% since June 6, Health Ministry said. time vaccine 93% effective preventing hospitalizations serious illness coronavirus""

Still looks good me. Whose say doesn’t hurt people? sure downvoted, fact absurd people clearly never read revelations. ""mark"" supposed implanted forehead palm hand. vaccine injection arm. anything anti-vaxers work evil spreading vaccine misinformation costing lives brainwashing bullshit. know 100% foolproof. Moron.  can't vaccinated stay home leave. harm anyone either. :) necessarily, protection level drops time goes on. coupled variants lambda may evade pre-existing antibodies putting vaccinated people risk. isn’t majority world vaccinated.   Yes. *every* business. ones groups people X number gather publicly indoors.    like flu new boosters worked continue worked on.

Also... less idiot people bad thing... staff take care watch die, feel bad them, idiots vaccinated.

Even economy, less people = less crazy job competition = companies paying actual living wage.

It sounds morbid feel bad people can't get vaccinated poorer countries, could big benefit globally.  seeing emerging strains simply evade vaccines

Scientific misinformation. Reported know bunch work, ages. I'm sure they're glad either. stuck home.

Speak diapers, shitting pissing wear those? people finessing actually making moves  Amen Thank protecting others. know number young people like you, went right it. thing work people actually see loved one battle severe case covid.

Here's anecdote aligns opinion.

My mom's family spouting nonsense conspiracy theory bullshit Covid vaccines last year. Aunt gets Covid 2.5 weeks ago, see doctor almost week, finally goes ER literally almost dying. Doctor said less 24 hours away death. improving rapidly begging family get vaccinated. mom got first shot Monday. Another Dutchman here. annoy all, 'Holland' ok  Well, hope get vaccinated push back. dunno, based vaccinated people reacting this, attitude unvaxxed. Bitches entitled regardless believe. 100% onboard sentiment. got vaccine stayed indoors year, I’m done masks. Especially masks try save conspiracy theory dimwits. body choice! Yes, wrongly correcting autocorrect logical thing all.   know rural parts county, vax rates around 40%, yet one wearing masks. I'm wearing mask inside even though I'm vaxxed, trust assholes. guy went high school caught COVID early vaccine available. double lung transplant. Shit fucked. need to. start worrying vaxxed folks start suffering hospital-needing services. yet LA county punishing people played rules got vaccinated. get entire population revolt following restrictions.  Stealth health   It’s petty nothing you’re feeling unreasonable. you’re fifteen, shit going like year half, that’s significant portion life. 
When you’re forty/fifty/sixty years nothing, passes blink eye. age, would fully understand wanted scream cry street 🤷🏾‍♂️ It’s petty grown folks freak out, whatever need friend, shall judge it.  Firstly barely seeing rise hospitalizations, although may yet happen. comparison UK says happen like last year since vulnerable people vaccinated. 

Secondly Netherlands screwed opening way soon. makes different situation places. would've worked released Wuhan instead 570 miles away... Caring leads caring actions. There's magic involved.

You got vaccinated cared something, even yourself.

Caring something =/= thoughts prayers Unpopular opinion Reddit I’m sick masks. I’m vaccinated, spent year doors, I’ll put it’s legally required it’s hill want die otherwise I’m fucking done masks. Recently, place employment dropped mask rules recommend unvaccinated people still wear masks everyone still carry one courtesy choose still wear them. also encouraged everyone get vaccine, duh, heard rumors even going far pay everyone gets poke $200.

One person see every often talking wasn’t going get vaccine “for $200? Hell yeah!”

Like c’mon. One minute you’re putting “poison” body, sell measly $200 drop hat? took 200 FUCKING DOLLARS SELFISHLY DENSE FUCKING CABBAGE?!?!

And know others like person. mean least they’re getting god damn. Mind-boggling. pay them. Morons respond money.  Well, doofus.    Yea majority mask wearers people color too.  I'm vaccinated nearby County stopped wearing mask. work restaurant though people coming talking great see face mad weird. Smiling = tips though increase percentage made wearing mask worth it.   Thats entirely true. vaccine helps herd immunity. 100 percent effective new variants develop unclear work them. people still wearing indoors. 

The people wearing masks people bitching moaning non stop since whole thing started. 

It’s going massive shit show I’m literally shocked number vaccinated people refusing wear masks to. vaccinated doesn’t mean can’t catch spread virus??? literally never stopped wearing mask even tho got faxed ASAP. point think we’ve enough people who’ve taken vaccine know efficacy safety. Sure could doubt initially now? Step one leave California. Step two done provid vaccination records went college. remember go get something parents find record it. I'm sure different. They’d blame Obamacare.  creepy yo better way scream ""I'm uneducated dickhead"" try ""libs""  events 1950 1979? offered education get go school. Honor, ha, sir America.  Interesting please link report published LA I'm curious.  enter misinformation rabbit holes? consensus Eric Feigl-Ding? posts Twitter lot &amp; lot RTs now. things bad Tweets claim? 'better safe sorry' side? 'Independent SAGE' 'The Citizens'? Peak Prosperity (been watching guy's YouTube material since February 2020)? live US, also exposed usual US media like NBC, ABC, CNN, etc. US media amping Delta &amp; appear shifting panic mode. avoid Fox News. Glad &amp; relatives got vaccines we're still maskless public. one way end losing streak. spread fear. released statement regards exact statement prepare public. Delta main variant right multiple mutations taking place alarming. Nothing published enough scientific evidence available peer review. 

You're severly misinformed getting updates mutations specific spike protein immune escape. 

There many variants I've personally concerned simply dropped circulation. I'm simply speaking I'm seeing personal level currently. 

“Despite national, regional, global efforts, pandemic nowhere near finished. pandemic continues evolve four variants concern dominating global epidemiology. Committee recognized strong likelihood emergence global spread new possibly dangerous variants concern may even challenging control.”
— World Health Organization emergency committee there’s big difference living thriving. Research indicates children long Covid easily adults say they’d fine, isn’t entirely accurate. Covid evolved living dying disease. might COVID. woke day pretty bad sore throat (which apparently one main symptoms COVID) pretty immediately went get tested. Rapid PCR came back negative. Honestly thing everyone’s immune systems little week lack interaction year.   Right you. kid boat, answer Hello fellow kids missing something? You’re counting people haven’t yet vaccinated even though absolutely could, test daily? people already irresponsible they’re going responsible getting tested? wish shared optimism.  lack leadership? How? Numbers rising again, time mask up. rules since early pandemic. Lack leadership allowing numbers rise without intervention (like masks). Gotcha :) Maybe misinterpreted. hope things touched related you’re talking about. swear there’s room rational discussion sometimes, it’s “either you’re fully side you’re enemy” lol. Glad got though glad you’re willing speak mind. Lol LA county, back masking 😅 Yep, infuriating. got kidney transplant 2018, starting feel pretty confident health stability late 2019. starting make bigger plans travel things last year. 

...yeah, instead watch everyone turn around blame audacity live vulnerable pandemic virus. Seeing people less bare minimum, telling stay inside get frustrated enough speak out, put faith humanity negative numbers. 

You're alone, friend. wish worst time it, know others like you, done everything right, still can't reap benefits health conditions. superiority tactic used bully fear minds people. health officials accompanied army person fatigues go knocking door door asking people want covid shot. preys weak fearful. Thanks. think it’s tragic. people probably relieved vaccinated, really bad luck. makes sad families. Thanks, newborn appreciates compassion. I'm loop comes internet celebrities I'm even sure millions lot, since reference point. definitely touch. saying still exist. Probably stay long though. Barely. Nice hyperbole comment around. Why? fuck 'em, that's why! vaccinated least offer protection catching unvaccinated players around vaccinated ones unfair. putting rest team way worse situation making outbreak easier start. really understand damn hard go get vaccinated part. Ur dad brother .ore much smarter u.u know soon why. Thank comment Guess didn’t see  Yankees mostly got J&amp;J too. lot went got once. believe latest report today's positives mostly J&amp;J one mRNA vaccine. far asymptomatic unless new update come since I’m teacher shoved classroom seeing 125 unmasked, unvaccinated students day. I’m vaccinated, 1 year old isn’t! quit job, I’d lose healthcare really need because, oh yes, I’m pregnant. 😭What do?

ETA: I’m low vaxx state coworkers, even though teacher, Covid deniers.    Meh. first one painful shot I've ever gotten. know othet people said too.

No point lying it. one claiming articles exist. onus provide proof. would articles outright say ""the Chinese vaccine proven work"" - articles saying ""the Chinese vaccine proven less effective MRNA vaccines"" (true) ""the Chinese vaccine proven ineffective stopping spread Chile/Seychelles/wherever""(also true). US next, please. government industry wanted do, enough time set infrastructure allow without causing delays. Early September. Good news. Canada come.  point vaccine pass encourage uptake, problem with, reopen indoor dining. public health team made clear either wait September people vaccinated. Oh yes. unvaccinated person went indoor concert Florida last April. wonder even bothered masks then? Florida he’s counted cases now, sure April.  not, family able actually go work. People aren’t falling dead streets fork Covid, hospitals operating normally. really fine. Vaccination end game. vaccinated fine wear masks crowds indoors. likely release booster new variants. end like flu new set variants every year get flu shot. Welp NNN getting new members. real endgame would viable treatment along vaccine. reading kind felt like 'well people get Covid going die anyway, causes'. haven’t hospitalized anything like that; article says they’re OK. likelihood fine. melodramatic “I’m losing hope every day?” people tested positive vaccinated? knew could would happen don’t get doomerism. don’t. vaccines almost completely break case-death link, essentially making COVID like common cold mild flu vast, vast,

Looking netherlands Sydney, think we're locking winter imagine would go country that’s afraid government issuing identity cards. There’s absolutely chance hell US ever something like this. seem what's happening Delta variant all. original strain, younger healthy people likely get, worst, bad cold. they're filling hospitals.   Lol ok Good thing we're going start censoring wrong thing FB yeah completely wrong. Everything said lie. lying.

Florida COVID cases 7 day rolling average than...CALIFORNIA despite much smaller state.  radically downplaying things many people live last 18 months sake community . People want shit anymore going small population risk people, matter is. wear mask.  Wow, that's terrible. live area almost everyone virus even know ten people seriously sick. quick drop cases vaccine implementation, slower uptick reopening seems point towards unvaccinated people acting like things normal. Anyone vaccinated taking measures protect themselves, know goes. protect protect themselves, back mask mandates. Say vaccine injury we'll pay 100k/year remainder life matter serious vaccine injury is. horribly though. people seem perfectly happy situation, financially much better point.  yeah, calling out... moreso /r/losangeles ignoring science Population aged 18-44. tiniest fraction eligble medical reasons.

Contrary Reddit stereotypes, mainly 30s resisting getting vaccine.  Well said. High school blip life matter. experiences really shaped me. live Northern California. stores, 50% people wear masks. gym, nearly 95% people wear masks. 

I support re-instating mask mandates California. point mask mandates reduce workload doctors nurses prevent hospitals becoming overwhelmed. many new cases March June 2020.  koreatown requires Can't hospital send home? hope gets approved kids soon. youngest one vaxxed, really don’t want getting sick school, breakthrough case us.

I don’t know anyone died, know couple people long COVID think it’s pretty terrifying spend rest life permanent organ damage. Brilliant we've Delta issues UK longer (e.g. London double population LA 4,000+ cases day currently) &amp; Monday remove legal requirements wear masks social distance. even know quite make that. believe 90 percent covid hospitalizations deaths Florida vaccinated people. I'd love read reliable source that. 30 percent less effective  piece cloth. Grow  masking part living virus ? explanation admittedly simplified one. However, married someone working one covid vaccines informed regarding many. speaking specifically regarding trials Covid MRNA vaccines fact scaling based number age ajacent factors-age, weight, height. Good call. Even places like public transportation good mask up. old way living pre pandemic feels really dirty me. used take buses 50+ people didnt even consider danger germs. think even covid practically continue wear masks places. ?! Nothing I’ve said anti-mask ?! I’m pro-mask. Measles too.  Correct, point prevent another variant developing

All need wear mask... LA giving OC much shit antimask we're antimask ourselves?! comes karens!!! honestly stop treating people. waste resources.  can't stop laughing stupid humans are. I'm sorry buddy family exactly gave human race covid. podiatrist, access emerging strains? ""we""? variants infect vast majority vulnerable finite amount time. Many die. Many ill long time. friends, family depend suffer myriad ways. like calculate long take. forever.

I opt active participation causing suffering. grand scheme end same. opt virus go around rather through. difference whether contribute suffering matters me. matter enough care enough contribute willing suffer little minor inconvenience. compensation compassion much less likely suffer colds, flu, allergens, smog meanwhile.

So even though I'm fully vaccinated continue wear respirator otherwise minimize risk extent possible. mild inconvenience short time, permanent existential torment make be. ends virus variants die around world soon enough start getting colds flu hayfever again. isn’t vaccines work. support narrative dimwits I’m sure good study, doctors often give remdesivir sicker patients based hospital protocols Lol Make sure allow entry fully vaccinated. hunch opening partially vaxxed probably played role number missed second doses countries Testing positive symptomatic two different things. Trust vaccine. Everyone 12+, except currently infected covid-19, get vaccinated.

There contraindication common them. mean... ""Honor system"" among people refuse what's best population pretty much going happen anyway right? one surprised people adhering ""honor system"" right? That's actually university saying right now, FDA approval comes through, longer accept ""personal reasons"".  I'm fully vaccinated. woke yesterday feeling good. Sore throat first bad cough. start get worried? I've rarely get sick. impossible achieve 100% always handful people community can't choose to, however strongly feel living Australia get close, vast majority Australians want vaccine supply (blame feds)  likelihood child dying COVID-19 low, even worth mentioning. yeah, choosing vaccinate Yeah, neighborhood South Bay LA really good masking like, EVERYWHERE June order dropped. Like honestly think ever saw 5 people store without mask ever. 

But went orange county decent amount people without masks order came lol. would assume virus remains endemic, face exposure point. trust vaccine keep either asymptomatic least mildly ill.

Public officials, athletes, etc. tested frequently normal people--the New York Yankees great recent case team facing COVID outbreak, vaccinated players asymptomatic. probably known positive COVID testing every day, probably know test positive either. ask vaccine mandate too?  Thank you. understand though. hard need better job educating general public. LOL, reminds commercials:

""Offer valid 49 states. &lt;smarmy-ass Sorry, Tennessee!!""  Well, guess say Covid YET deadly Spanish Flu. seems moving direction new variant, it? Also, seems folks hospital much younger better health people hospitalized 2020. vaccine widely available anyone wanted now. again?  Yeah really really running sympathy willingly unvaccinated U.S. Frankly point could care less case numbers knowing damn near 100% deaths among unvaxxed hard reconcile reinstatement mask mandates restrictions. simple task get shot protects you, literally everyone else planet earth. don’t want lose family members friends this, havent yet, sadly people hard headed immortality complex… nothing bad could ever happen right? *sigh* moves creating safe effective vaccine providing free doses everyone. can't save people choose take vulnerable regardless. going get sick eventually matter do.

Our hospitals handled last wave. roughly half population immune, next wave smaller. yeah reason wasnt lab leak Alex Jones.  posting something April 2020?

Oh right, thing science whatever said first means always stays way. given sun revolves around earth scientists said hundreds years ago. won’t end. Yes, everyone get vaccinated, got mine soon able, isn’t public health it’s control fear, read responses forum. sizeable amount replies people scared unvaccinated coworkers calling mandatory vaccine passport tracking heaping blame unvaccinated directed do. Vaccine end game never long many easily controlled fear aspect pandemic. Downvote hell want it’s pathetic I’m reading here. never leave homes unafraid enjoy life continue panic every time media government tell so.  Yes you’re relatively young healthy pretty mild get delta vaccination. Like getting cold less. pretty much awful. wasnt damn lab leak. Lol part said triggered you? 

I could mad this, too. homeschooled 2 teens 8 year old year. 17 year old missed 1st year college. almost died last November able hug parents Idk long now.

I choose good things things right now. People dying matter I'm sick it... I'm going make anything harder anybody doctors nurses still showing save lives. say, ""Screw it, I'm tired able fun stuff."" tired, too.

I mean, want all, like said—mask mandates starting Saturday. matter much want it— happening. 

So going do?

You complain feel sorry could maybe embrace things are. 

A mask kill you... last forever. good attitude makes helluva difference. I’m rather scared needles myself, wouldn’t even known got first dose vaccine guy didn’t say “3, 2, 1” sticking lol mean blue jays Yeah, think everyone wants vaccine now. Covid going continue tearing unvaxxed populations vaxxed + natural immunity reaches whatever level needs reach. event continued attacks vaccinated population, responsible followed science expert recommendations (and continue so) beginning nothing stop spread. well might idea, worth shot. 

I vaccine trial (Novavax, studies show like 90% effectiveness) still gotten EUA yet. Recently sent guess would work? worked job (in LA) showing proof vaccination. yeah thats dumb sorry lol. you. them. idiots follows Facebook videos ,pages.youtube flat earth people. takes shit load work become doctor, scientist. suddenly person make video says, believe you. close falling category vaccines. Vaccines causes autism. realized ,and research college student great peer review scholarly articles. stated benefits them. world coming together stop CoVid ,we new way vaccination via new way technology. researchers noticed may even help cancer patients.

Don't loose hope, remember happened Spanish flu. Polio. Vaccinations helped end bad eras. Going burn unvaccinated populations, hopefully die fast. Hopefully thing US across vaccinated regions world.

The thing watch getting sick hospitalized large numbers--are vaccinated not? are, that's worrying. aren't, trust jab! Maybe could Katniss Everdeen tour across every district country convince everyone. walking distance I'm sorry hear that. get uber call cab? think uber give free rides vaccine clinics. able handle one loss, let alone 10.

It basically looks like since won’t reach herd immunity vaccination move learn live thing. Otherwise we’re going keep saying “hold little longer” five years now. mutations scary, think there's evidence believe going mutate bypass people, fact, well could mutate make harder infect people--infection depends little infamous protein spike latches onto cells. vaccines prevent happening. virus mutate try latch differently, much mutation might able latch onto human hosts all.

The important thing remember successful mRNA vaccines know work safe. huge part took much time 2020--making sure vaccines worked safe. going way faster keep changes virus now. virus changes much slower flu virus does--the Delta variant still similar enough vaccinate it, whereas flu one done year even sure going vaccinate right one strain different.

Either way, nice. realize weekly enough deduce trends, quickly things deteriorating, good see day day flow.  Yeah whatever good news people vaccine spread still… Oh bad. thought I’d heard 50%   fair demand business serve someone they’re fully vaccinated? 

… believe guidelines *unfair* simply you’re thirsty? way find drink? ""most"" it? doubt that. Compared facebook/twitter, reddit probably rounding error total %. cases largely amongst unvaccinated Why? danger? people want live kind normality without masks, absolutely. cry babies cry babies always get way. Never  Vaccinated occasionally getting sick FUCKING almost mild cases it. vaccines work. People get vaccinated want avoid severe cases disease. right gun. right shoot you. limits rights acceptable. government expressed intentions make mandatory. Hence protests. I'm antivax. I'm vaccinated myslef hate antivaxers death. said that, french government goes beyond headlines. Businesses risk fines arrestations police qr code everyone needs carry pretty much everywhere. 

I want people get vaccinated need get hell beyond crazy. doubt vaccine would cure brain damage caused by, presumably, oxygen deprivation. Homeschooling then. Yeah bad news sadly oddly enough I’ve never gotten tattoo, think thinking might get something small next time wife gets one, I’ve pretty much settled “circle circle, dot dot” (now got cootie shot, know kids rhyme make girls icky.)

Would kind cool get reward vaccinating.

The tattoo would tiny anyway, literally two small circles two dots. mid winter? fucking joke. Delta get majority October.  sure understand. It’s heated topic. I’m really passionate too, mutations ever-present fear humming low frequency back mind. 

But even got everyone board US, pervasiveness lot countries without access vaccines low vaccination rates still puts us risk mutations make way here.

It’s shitty way around. Lol no. I'm staunch mask advocate general. something want right sucks. go again. It’s coming Vaccine. Passports. Now.  It’s punishment. bad anti-pantser ;) 😂😂 long last??? Damn, expected September before. can’t really find official study recent NYT article expressing it’s likely deadlier.

I’m virologist either, initially, variant said deadlier, turn be. people say India shows it’s deadlier, really, people got sick contagious variant, nothing shows percentage people got sick died increased. feel like people keep stressing nothing worry vaccinated keep hearing people got vaccine getting sick. feel like data weeks away. Many people 50's ,not immunocompromised,or immunocompromised young family member like have.

I keep wearing masks.I mind downvoting. 1% lot people still lot people dead. educated means accepting data fit myopic narrative. example, already COVID, current data suggests get (antibodies cool). age 25, likely die car accident COVID. fact know long term side effects COVID vaccines, simply data. kind funny case COVID vaccines, knowing long term side effects considered trivial unknown need worry about. However, case teen vaping (OH TEEN VAPING) short-term science suggests basically safe, know long term effects, must banned everywhere! bizarre --- almost like data bent fit particular narratives? days, call building narrative data ""following fuck phrase 'following science' understand correctly longer virus circulating variants come current vaccines longer effective. effort vaccines works roll enough people fast enough.

It’s easy say “educate yourself” practice seen many highly educated people become completely sucked conspiracy theories propagated internet. political issues it’s bad enough, covid see real world spread disease choices people told make. think weaponization harmful propaganda via internet one challenges generation. argument throughout thread traditional standards free speech seem equipped counter problem.

My failure practical solution offer. Obviously risks conditionally discarding protections 1A extreme don’t know ethical method might cut covid disinformation public discussion.  Correct, neglected carry 0. Even worse. Still, reliable figure considering entire pool vaccinated people exposed COVID, pool cannot determine size of. 7% limited set really get us anywhere. Reported cases always lower actual case number. know this, least little reassuring think way.  Welcome club

Welcome club

Welcome squidward

Welcome squidward

Welcome squidward I’m literally fucking livid right now. Didn’t want get drunk tonight choice percentage vaccination endgame? 70% goal awhile we’re basically there. No. religious beliefs prevent vaccination educated home. work home get delivery. exposing others unvaccinated selves. Separation church state. ability practice beliefs ends point start endangering others. Yeah 100% knew that. Everyone handle differently around years years.

We get booster shots like yearly flu shot ect goal go back normal, huge uptick cases likely come, we'll see reinstated mask mandates lockdowns. next wave ought smaller slower harder disease spread every person immune. can't prove that, course, makes sense me.

I wish way, see way. Nature heartless cruel. immune system work, there's nothing really long term. another solution them, would use it. pretty clear don't. Yeah learned 4 million people die losers claim “media hype” justify selfish are. Wow, thanks super detailed well thought response! TIL lot! well said  think people rightfully concerned thanks toxic former commander-in-chief, accusations lab leak could misconstrued racism (as sadly already many circles) Chinese people Asian people general. That's real concern important lab leak theory discussed carefully right language. federal mask mandate realistic likely harm good vulnerable populations fight back reasonably expected. 

That’s unacceptable risk take 

Unfortunately that’s position US in. 

A mask mandate much achievable honestly it’s late that. 

That CDC announcement incredibly ill-timed results exactly expected. living hell problem, jerk? died made God?

reporting right toxicity violating rules sub. Even then, vaccines incredibly effective mutations far. honestly doubt wouldn’t mutation. It’s way spike protein works. Uh. Hospitalizations doubled Florida last month.

It level last November... know, right second wave deaths. giving time, point get vaccinated get infected. &lt;15% capacity work shifts door got gently remind people need mask. interesting see people reacted that. part genuinely “oops forgot”, weren’t genuine forgetfulness claimed medical exemption (again, genuine). could tell actually may medical reason could see eyes worried wouldn’t believe think poorly thanks assholes ran amok abused medical exemption rule. 

Among people occasional total nut job, came people funny watch others’ reactions one person started going communism I’m asking nicely mask up.   travels US immediately  sound like less decent human sure Fortunately, deaths mostly stupid selfish people refuse get vaccine, nice allow natural selection run course remove garbage population. Feel bad people can't get shot due medical reasons. JNJ may good Well, vaccine approved pregnant woman (at least live). course people hesitating.
Also lot doctors would refuse vaccinate witout official approval.
All important keep measures vaccination available everyone. vaccines longer endgame, is?

They are, enough people getting them. They're breeding new variants bodies putting compromised immune systems risk.  elbow length latex gloves. knows people touching. personal responsibility get vaccinated. Congrats selfish unvaccinated people, 3rd wave comping up.  pay end hospital.  even know allowed stop. small habit  shit happens bro. look bright side, least didnt get shipped World War four years like great grandfather. aint shit compared forefathers deal with. keep grittin teeth push forward  people, also cannot get vaccinated like immunocompromised. need protected, healthcare system. I'm personally agreement people choose refuse vaccination face consequences, there's way isolate unfortunately. Well I'm scientist working biotech maybe half us wearing masks work. lab group meetings, hardly anyone masked. pandemic over. 
I feel ashamed people know better, yet, exposed. oh go well No, course lot would complain. fight one thing, fight effective one.  should, think it’s horseshit. punishing vaccinated people?

The vaccine available anyone wants get it. Darwin take care rest. It’s ridiculous impose vaccinated don’t want it.

It’s free country, allowed want it. Doesn’t mean impose restrictions everyone, didn’t outlaw collective punishment fucking Geneva convention fucks sake.

This much theater Japan Olympics right now, it’s silly. entirely, deplatforming works, solution looked (rather imprisonments). look positive effects kicking Trump Twitter. kind nice around people coughing sneezing covering mouths cleaning hands. Like... Dudes... cause wearing masks mean back apes won’t, 99%+ survival rate.. lol they’ll fine. Guess shall see accurate saying end mutating serious strains pandemic nowhere near over. think are, won’t see fully vaccinated anywhere without double masking. rarely leave house, surprise, haven’t won’t get it. needles tv look particularly long thick took 7-years Spanish Flu resolve. Orange County never even enforced begin whomever gets stopped pulled LA claim theyre OC. sniper vaccine shot ass anti-vaxxers mile away hope that's case mine well. be. make sure direct anger people get vaxxed, legislators perpetuating problem. nothing LA mandating masks again. People voting false identities real issue, there's evidenceof widespread issue. People getting vaccinated is.    “100 percent Covid hospitalizations unvaccinated people.”

You said yourself.

So everyone else forced wear mask, likely restrictions, protect don’t give single fuck refuse get vaccinated???? Asians Africans people ever see wearing masks more. Never took mine off. need early treatments keep people hospital together Oh? level viral load person exposed nothing probability breakthrough infection?

A vaxxed person room 1 person shedding virus better worse odds infection room 20 people shedding virus?

A person exposed day virus particles odds infection person exposed 10 times day?

Yeah, no. course matters. Exactly. America celebrating like Covid exist. Meanwhile, what's happening Africa Asia pretty terrifying. really hope put emphasis treatment options. Vaccines amazing need better treatments get hospitalized emerging strains. Whether you’re “done this” think “anti vax people deserve get” medical professionals try save lives everyone show up. exhausted emotionally drained. know nurse believes it’s hoax make okay disregard way rest fighting. We’ve stuck home. They’ve forced watch painstaking efforts go vain patient patient dies alone. annoyed masks. drench ppe sweat everyday. another perspective, really fond memories built group friends stayed close 30s highschool. can't imagine going school getting experiences. really feel youth today.  Odds there's mutation, it'll happen somewhere much lower vaccination rates US. opinion\*  
Mask mandates essentially set end coming flu season. Wearing mask costs nothing hurts nobody, works well covid variants. 

Other regulations like reduced occupancy closures businesses real economic costs debatable, masks literally downside. understand even keep debating requirement go epidemic that's filling hospitals killing people. 

 \* Opinion based PhD biology, experience publishing articles public heath journals, particular political affiliation, wanting see people die. Yes. Minorities aren’t capable getting vaccinated. racist. /s   Well good thing already  What’s new? US surgeon general probably even know fucking point anymore Interesting least doesn’t contradict 6 months rule (saying infected safe 6 months infection) Germany. Why? people wear masks anymore. changes nothing. fought mask mandates. 

You think every state going willing go along vaccine mandate? attitude last weekend. finally visited parents met new niece nephew (covid babies) year extremely diligent. Well anti-vax morons caught covid right arrived. feel like shit, awful cough, I’m getting tested tomorrow. 

That 95% effective rate made feel pretty invincible, still get it. least won’t end hospital, hopefully. Fire getting vaccine. pharmacy that. numerous court legislative efforts shut idea. [Some states outright banned use part [an extremely partisan divide legislators public opinion polling, although even current administration come firmly It’s actually 7%, .07%. even that. Sometimes children need larger doses medicine (in proportion bodies vs. adults) way metabolize it. Thanks lot, unvaccinated douchebags Please please please Santa Clara: this...   No...that answer all. provided links things already know.

So back original question chain, perceived endgame here? Fuck man, you’re unvaccinated that’s problem. I’m gonna worry peoples health don’t care themselves. 

Also, Insurance pay unvaccinated people’s medical bills unless medical reason vaccinated. I’m LA wonder I’d comply was. think probably would people also complying don’t want cause trouble. 

I’m fully vaccinated point don’t care unvaccinated people die. Mutations, children &amp; comorbid individuals also risk, guess I’d agree reasons. I’m really struggling give shit dying anti-vaxxers. Fun fact. Macron met wife 16 39. mother three teacher affair teenage student.  Religious belief, well see much vaccinated exemption signing affidavit says religious reasons. Maybe like 2% people get vaccinated want lie. pandemic global event. individual experience. personally safe, mean people still danger. 

There whole world outside wealthy developed countries. hankering poutine. think holds true delta variant well, right? think FDA reckless enough approve dangerous vaccine emergency use. suddenly trust paperwork complete. Makes sense. Vaccines would look like endgame people (antivaxxers) werent completely dumb it. 

Theyre soooo focused body naturally forming immunity forget virus gets stronger faster immunity permanent damage? unvaxed early 20s sister brain fog/dizziness/fatigue, unvaxed mom partial numbness hands, unwaxed step-dad permanent lung damage (confirmed X-rays) 90% loss subjective ability taste smell.

Let guess...by definition, they've ""recovered"" simply dying covid, right? nearly 5 months since infected. I'd like say ""go niners"" ""beat LA"". That's all. Stupid Chargers. Great Hockey! Ignore downvotes, good getting yours. Better late never! I’ve wondered awhile - smokers often pay higher premiums known health risks shouldn’t people refuse vaccines?  Vaccines 100%. feel like anything predicted. soon hard Delta variant, watched reopening announcement like, ""Sure...give month"". think officials knew would happen give people taste vaccinated life/herd immunity feels like incentivise people getting vaccine. mean, unvaccinated people living pandemic. hearing lot stories people know got sick regretted getting vaccine. think 70% hope for, seems world trend highest rate voluntary vaccination programs. would done vaccine passports start instead assuming people don’t want get vaxxed would wear mask, wouldn’t happened. guess “personal freedom” important health thousands people.

Not feel bad unvaxxed assholes, feel bad kids can’t get yet depend us empathetic adults. whole thread full folks think everyone get vaccinated. I’m way. really doesn’t bother mask on. kids home unvaccinated. wear them.
And even though risk low, 100 percent effective — benefits throwing mask outweighs not. 
Whenever see people masks store kind assume viewpoint, wearing mask unvaccinated. would curious actual breakdown is. 
I remember hearing npr couple months ago things really started opening (when cdc said vaccinated don’t need wear masks) still majority people going restaurants/bars unvaccinated. ignorant. Tons kids getting COVID 12 ineligible vaccine. CDC said though fully vaccinated. get info scientifically vaccinated people must also wear mask? I'm still wearing mine I'm vaxxed Thanks! course doesn’t excuse idiots. rest us vaccinated spread children can’t get vaccinated due medical issues. every get vaccinated yet.  **Asking providing medical advice allowed - includes speculating dosages, supplements, active ingredients.** cannot responsible health. need general information, please refer CDC's website need specific medical advice, please contact qualified medical professional area.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* way see it, there's couple options America.

1. majority vaccination, mandate masks regardless vaccination status. great, fan forcing vaccinated people mask want to.

2. Require proof vaccination reenter society. Probably gonna fly America.

Does anyone solutions?  Vaccinated people get spread non-delta too. excuse anti-vaxx bullshit. Lame troll attempt. Well, congratulations answering question completely context asked in. welcome adding much. grew small town California, better places there.  Tbh wish let unvaccinated get wanted: covid Ya. Nope. I'm protecting willfully stupid. first thought - hockey season proceed planned. 

&amp;#x200B;

Woo!  I'm really sorry. sucks. 7 billion people going sucks them. wish suck ways does, really do. But, are, shit situation together. life good times bad.  Take comfort world made people suffer much worse times these, ancestors bore weight still found joy. 

For me, look endgame, one such. today make good one even missing something would whole mess started. Slowly, get things back, someone tv tells over. piss years away waiting perfect tomorrow. something similar guess December 2019 however lasted 3 half days so. hard time breathing, shivers, threw couple times. worst sickness since swine flu. Really? would one access passport?  really cost economy much though? spend billions business closures people get sick flu? So…this happening non-vaccinated folks masking up?? mean hell feel bad under-12s Sadly agree. parents get vaccinated I'm 99% sure someone family dies, change minds. ""It's big deal, cold government trying control us."" teacher sees kids dealing I’m 100%. enough enough teens paying harshly loss high school experience. Masks seem like valid solution concerns current batch vaccines preventing transmission new variants. Go live life. kids really crappy year (and half about) good masking staying away folks protect mom dad grandma grandpa. vaccinated including kids (all 12). free go out, see friends, whatever. ask still mask stores, don’t friends. collective risk mitigated vaccines part. you. Go life. It’s ok. Top Golf today Florida. Things good. Talking shit hitting balls. Topic turned vaccines body, choice. Oh lord.....fucking help me. Well kids younger 12 can't vote drop large ~~bribes~~ , mistake *campaign donations* governor's reelection campaign. disdain simply lack caring towards unfortunate reality. study initial wave NE last year. situation even close comparable. We've gone almost immunity widespread immunity vaccination past infection.  Donate South East Asia please. Well, may getting vaccinated, getting antibodies. taking little longer, get them. Yep, I'm vaccinated. part. I'm wearing mask idiots refused vaccinated. Let nature sort out.  least actually effective. we've heard since beginning kids really affected it. That's everyone pressuring get back schools. change expectation. [France total 926,000 people, 35, booked jabs since French president’s Monday evening address, Niox-Chateau said. health minister, Olivier Véran, confirmed almost million appointments booked, “which means thousands lives said 21 July anyone wanting visit theatre, cinema, sports venue festival audience 50 people would need show health pass proving either fully vaccinated tested requirement extended bars, cafes, restaurants, shopping centres, hospitals, long-distance trains planes 1 August, president said. Free Covid tests, meanwhile, end September, “to encourage address watched 22.4 million people, Macron also said vaccinations would mandatory health workers, retirement home staff others working vulnerable people, sanctions fully vaccinated September.

1 million fucking people got vaccinated since MONDAY Macron announced this. GMAFB, pure brilliance. think mask mandate effective, simply takes question ""is fully vaccinated person going unmasked, liar?"" makes blanket requirement everyone. assumed news would mean indoor dining allowed right now. end game - think we'll see vaccine mandates employers, schools, etc. vaccines get full FDA approval. Yeah, weird proponents Invermectin know construct properly designed RCT studies. agree, responding comment made seem like thought endgame here.

So back original question chain, perceive endgame here? along thought getting vaccinations available adults wanted them. We've country appear good enough many. LA pretty good following instructions compared places like OC San Diego. Garbage policy protect anti-vaxxers. cries Florida.. claimed standard care. wrong. go far did. guy position careful words. Raising insurance rates unvaccinated great idea. I'm sure pharmacy billed Federal Government fake shots never administered.

This result FULL audit pharmacy would bet anything lot things *gone missing* *can't accounted for* pharmacy. Meanwhile, hospitals parts Missouri USA beginning get overwhelmed: yep, here. Go live life outside system. It’s now. Don’t rely government schools live teenage years. can't seem break habit kids home. know risk low, wanna keep low possible. Illegal current law politically impossible. fed narrative media government vaccine safe, save ""mild"" breakthrough cases. want people get vaccine, obviously provide high degree protection death severe illness. anecdotal evidence right points vaccine great reducing transmission symptoms people would deem mild. specifically happening Delta variant. Right read plenty stories may even know people (I do) fully vaccinated spread virus others. woods yet IMO wearing mask small sacrifice protect one another further. continues blow mind infuriated people get statement. went through. I'll Canada enjoying face freedom Yeah...that's absolutely infuriating me. vaccinated person, number is, far, number need know order accurately evaluate risk myself, number government needs know order order accurately evaluate risk vaccinated. decision track 100% insane decision I've ever seen made U.S. public health officials. Algonquin Park come! get point, youre wrong

masks help stop spread.

vaccines help stop virus body. impossible? People getting antibodies, whether via easy way hard way. North America continent, Latin America region speak Romance languages I.e. Mexico many places, younger people aren’t yet eligible vaccines, even eligible like USA aren’t necessarily getting vaccinated. apparently vaccine hesitancy resistance isn’t problem USA. Apparently people Russia refusing vaccinated cases lying vaccinated: long term, exposure therapies really effective treating specific phobias (and needle phobia particularly dangerous means delaying medical care).

In short gotta-get-this-done-now term: distraction. Bring portable video game, listen music, start chat tech friend get with. There's numbing creams doctor prescribe well think would help. punishing wear mask? piece fabric. strictly true. East Asia still flu season even something like 90% masking winter. That's big debate whether masks actually worked beginning.

Getting closer 100% pandemic helped stop spread COVID (at least Japan, government jack diddly lack total crisis largely due universal masking), laughable think America ever return 100% masking. never got first place. emergency. Triage. better university... says ""required"" unless medical ""personal"" reason. Like...you can't say ""required"" ""personal reason"" sentence. Exactly this. wear mask stores know shit people spewing nose mouth. need bunch strangers. I’ll save friends family get togethers. think mean essential workers… Vaccines actual solution. reason, thought said 19 (I age partially covered cursor, I'm entirely sure made pixels could see, what), quite confused talked going back high school...

To point, though, definitely empathize you. academic part school experience about, even part drastically diminished online-only. Kids really tough right now.  people get vaccinated they’re gonna wear mask forever.

So stupid, move this. honesty risk kids extremely low. Like less deaths normal flu seasons low despite many schools stayed person done hybrid stuff much last year. know rare autoimmune issues get lot headlines that’s exception rule. amount harm we’re kids academically socially going nightmare road, know many toddlers preschoolers socially waaaay behind be.

At point I’m going say three shots elderly high risk folks boost immunity levels since anti vaxxer morons clearly don’t give shit let whatever happens happen. Get variant boosters months vaxxed folks get life idiots go gamble lives.

Fuck selfish idiots venue LA deliberating allowing vaccinated shows today. Upper management fully towards requiring. owners debating. local leaderships don’t seem ready endemic, like still think eradicate People going carry them. Like guys really need drop idea everyone country going follow rules lot already think arbitrary.  way maximize vaccination rates change incentive structure. Vaccine passports indoor activities would trick example. know would never fly United States. 

Vaccination rates going up. We're five days exponential Delta growth away daily first doses - 250K/day - falling number people getting antibodies ""old fashioned"" way (infection) assuming 5-6X undercount cases - realistic figure given lack testing proclivity un-vaccinated population. 

Delta changed herd immunity game. Alpha, get 70% population vaccinated reduce spread noise. Delta, number gone north 90%. way happens organically anti-vax sentiment US. 

The US two paths: mandate effectively mandate vaccinations e.g. vaccine passports let Delta rip communities form antibodies way. I'd strongly prefer former tragically know latter going happen. great idea. enough vaccines cover population. Exactly! I'm sure anyone mindset thinking right. you’re going enforce mask mandates potentially restrictions again, point exit strategy this? people unvaccinated don’t want get vaccinated, it. get it, people around COVID increases chances even vaccinated person contract it, can’t ways. Let get natural immunity then. Aw, boo hoo. True enough. feel like bringing back mask mandates push people anti-mask  Youre correct, kindly explain point violent mob.  understand covid viruses general. nope, afraid. Kind like eat steak, know good cholesterol, since cant' see cholesterol care hehe. one Massachusetts don’t want get end journey feel like didn’t smoke enough pot. mandated places like Disney World NYC everyone complied. Perhaps it’s different now. love enforcing it. got married recently made sure invite anti-vaxxers want lives generally. Best decision wedding planning ever made. Ironically causing infertility dimwits would good thing. ooh don’t like 66% growth per week problem /s  Thats exactly feel! See article tweet. Deaths arranged age. job, I’m allowed TikTok app *personal* phone. work data ever device.

I don’t work government defense contractor anything like that.

But billion people use it? Yikes. That's wishful thinking though. People vaccinate put mask either unless force them, can't force can't tell glance.

Saying ""vaccinated people go maskless"" effective means free all. Agreed Yo mom found tonight got vaccinated went ape shit!! Humiliated Infront friends. I'm loss words right now. trust trusts goofy bastards tv telling people mark beast shit. much longer deal shit?? I'm tired ..fuck!! haven’t vaccines used US proven effective current variants?

The vaccines still pretty effective current variants, enough unless actually make everyone get vaccinated also take measures like mask wearing drive cases background declare victory. Encouraging people use masks anti-vaxx. July, one motivated ""If get vaccinated stop wearing mask"" left, anyone like ever existed all. we're facing another wave blunted take steps so, maskwearing everyone indoors key part it. Send them. Specifically, I’m looking 200 (“hundreds”) I’m calling BS.    abiding this. vaccinated since soon available. Done wasting life w shit Spanish flu killed 675,000 American's

Get face shield! health code specifies people allowed use certain kinds face shields instead masks! reason imagined they’d let snort cocaine  - policymakers covering ass one wants called guy nothing. good thing motivated charge decisions affect 10 million people.  assure needles shots hurt all! First time family agreed never felt needle. woudnt believed got shot watch myself. response directed  Insurance companies can’t deny healthcare idiocy smokers get lung cancer even someone decides wear seatbelt car accident would logically also need covered. It’s slippery slope start blaming people stupid behavior also poor air quality wildfires wildfire season ""over"" close flu season still good reasons wear masks...the mask literally bother one bit. assume anything anymore. assume maskless vaccinated assume mask wearers aren't. think house wear kids to.   vaccinations maximized, fully vaccinated people catching COVID issue. reason issue vaccinated person spreads COVID unvaccinated person person goes onto spread COVID unvaccinated people, well, get whole bunch exponential growth. people Netherlands found hard way!

The rate vaccinated people catch spread COVID vaccinated people good enough reason continue restrictions; restrictions always benefit unvaccinated masses. kids successfully vaccinated en masse, may well kiss restrictions goodbye. Virginia here. fully vaccinated January care mandate, I'm masking unless encounter variant truly escapes vaccine (which scientist actually work things living say nearly impossible would require changes spike protein would render virus incapable attaching ACE receptor first place). Maybe covid I’m hallucinating people fighting masks vaccines?! Please let truth. would require vaccines actually approved FDA, knows happen.  know single person covid--

Anecdotes mean anything, statistics. lying. Guess right too. Holy shit dude mask suffering  give up, man. generation gonna something special this. said, really sorry gotta experience age. coach kids age many years, exactly right. stuff calling crucial part growing up. came say it'll get better, keep sticking out, ever let crisis go waste. Learn, adapt, grow, overcome. Good luck.   know get downvoted figured I’d ask anyways. scared live lives? There’s million different ways people die far greater risks Covid. anti vax reading comments posts make wonder, someone damm scared something high survival rate? people risk double vaccinated already that’s good course people scared leave house like holly fuck. Follow protocols you’ll ok lol happens society every politician wants cover ass making intelligent decisions. set vaccination effort back even more, mention LA's already suffering small businesses. Everyone absolutely idiot least one now. 

There much else convince antivaxxers anyone else panicking starting California mandated mask sports canceled thought least manageable. think extended safety higher priority/focus primary endpoints. want kid protected anything, it’s tricky risk threshold.

I found article really explained complexities only! people creating fake vaccine cards hacking sharing vaccine passports? cause long haul covid sucks wearing mask indoors you’re eating hard might want cancel anything isn’t home town bit. might become common places world while.  Seriously, look away. Sit immediately look phone elsewhere. tell they're stick you. pay attention know it. Nah, busy posting misleading anti Israel propaganda could mandate vaccine right condition employment. 

Good. Coworkers put risk people's stupidity. Refusing get vaccinated harmful.. Throughout history millions upon millions people worse right now. control part focus things can't control. Focus control make life better. 

In grand scheme things high school nothing blip radar people lose contact knew high school rarely speak ever again. stress it. government make everyone else suffer vaccine passports, mean carrying around vaccination card? lot people probably anymore, they're probably pretty easy forge. mean whole new somewhat durable form, that's gonna cost money. mask mandate costs nothing. doesn’t disprove fact unvaccinated communities 99+ hospitalizations deaths, communities already facing shortages… 

Any shortages addressed transferring people hospitals areas overloaded communities vaccinated. I'm convinced we're answer close running beds. I'm suffer unvaccinated morons treated local also cause variants, variants concern, develop escape immunity. impacts everyone. 

Sure. unless way force get vaccinated, that's even close realistically cards, we're boat get natural immunity unless we're going stay restrictions hospitalizations death. 

No shit, get vaccinated. many refusing plan force what's right. cant wait till fully approve dont listen stupid argument anymore. I'm sure come another one tho. Wait? saying don’t understand masks work? Even now? Think cigarette smoke, cooking fumes etc. aerosols people's breath. big spit, cough droplets. personally hours fans running. mask (n95) preferably wipe sanitize surfaces. air wiping may caused airborne virus.  1918 pandemic really bad 2 years kind went away even without vaccine.

Looks like fast can. see problem. aiming zero Covid something like that? virus become politicized people deciding get decide real way germs always worked suddenly wrong. people, belligerently ignoring preventative measures kind self righteous statement.  Let Lidl Aldi handle it. selling tests 50 cents Germany. It’s really complicated. Buy test supermarket. Infront bar staff outside door. negative go in. takes 15 mins max.  live state vaccine levels pretty high still wear mask everywhere except home. I'd say pretty good majority people see outside wearing masks properly. 

I eaten meal restaurant since mid-2020. travel couple months less vaccinated area (😭) idea I'm going handle long plane ride (10 hours) much less family dinners restaurants.  Fuck that, I’m never complying another lockdown. I’m vaccinated. LA reinstated mask mandate, instead figured many people LA refusing vaccine. Right even orange county higher vaccination rate LA county says lot. No, we're behind, still enough vaccinated especially among younger people. Get vaccinated fucks  Irland really behind. It’s lyrics old song Flying Burrito Brothers dodging draft.   Imagine people followed science easily mislead Joe Rogan company podcasters. still remember Cuomo said quarantining New York states' rights!   FL team highest vaccination rate. require looking household transmission though... good thing though. means air flow, also means lower exposure time.

An exposure 15 minutes cumulative day (5min someone positive, another 10 min later still 15 min exposure). imagine sitting hours next people meeting rooms 30-60 meetings windows. They're WORLD Health Organization. India worst surge yet couple months ago, killing hundreds thousands least. 25% world's population one shot. Seems like need be. Certainly risk groups need close 100%. would also limit large gatherings unvaccinated capacity, needs carrot stick. Unfortunately since vaccination program become political issue, going hard. personal responsibility whatever mitigate risks risks others. alarming anyone Fourth July family gathering looks like 6 us tested positive. fully vaccinated except single person. 25 us total. nonvaccinated relative one hospitalized we’re thinking gave everyone. None us Covid before. 

Finally feeling pretty good 9 days symptoms, still quarantining though. It’s pleasant getting sick hasn’t life threatening vaccinated. 99% covid deaths unvaccinated people. sympathy limited. link articles? think focus start pandemic things getting worse daily combating pandemic rather focusing minor possibly could leaked lab? Yet, people focus latter then, pushing narrative here.

Who said were? early knowledgeable, reputable scientists

**No** scientists suggested lab leak remotely possible natural transmission. Again, please give obvious you, “conspiracy theory” insult

As obvious you, pushing lab leak source without mentioning alternative far likely pushing conspiracy intentionally sub alone, would downvoted oblivion suggesting mid-2020 it’s suddenly ok so?

Because people cared actually combating pandemic dealing minute possibility lab leak? Especially since narrative latter tended surrounded racism too. governments around world seek motivate citizens get innoculated without making vaccines mandatory, Chinese use education French use restaurants. tough situation everyone. 60% fully vaccinated - still low herd immunity, recent data suggests single shot limited efficacy Delta variant.

Look, I'm frustrated too, want go back normal well, I'm seeing repeat summer 2020 people scrambling open take advantage tourist season.

Would rather unlock, realise went fast undid sacrifice now? risk going bit slower far confident managing disease?  worry, would've never made UC. like Facebook, fantastic idea. Yeah. locked roads police soldiers people snuck around using back roads.sometimes can’t save people themselves. We'll get herd immunity hard way. said post replied 100% valid vaccinated person take extra precautions unvaxxed people gotten done infecting other. Saying choice imprecise, speaking terms societal policy. choice much risk unvaxxed people's infections - they're going happen, whether shorter longer period time. Yes, absolutely choice personally respond risk. conversation been, primarily, wisdom necessity NPI's. valid reason, imo, impose NPIs hospital capacity threatened. what's age comorbidities mind asking? think reward system vaccines broken early (see comment below) choose measures lower cases expressing confidence vaccine, didn’t way CDC didn’t gamble way Like get vaccines approved FDA mandate them? want wear mask protect anti-vaxxers hate wearing mask, go right ahead.  not. Hence ""fun fact"". Yes, sure religion superspreader. collecting news articles idea writing short paper. Eh, week two violating mask mandate vaccinated person rolled out. Mask mandates werw pretty impossible enforce unwilling even 2020; retail employees paid enough equipped job cop, people really like calling cops days. CDC done lot wrong, instance relating correct info problem, imo.

It really surprising colleges, schools workplaces requiring vaccines, either mandate incredibly onerous requirements unvaccinated al cruise lines. me, error things like CA requiring masks students instead barring unvaccinated entry high schools.  like quarter humanity? it’s also duration. 15 min train ride vs 8 hours office. potentially effective care safety....which got vaccinated. protected protecting others best can.

A mask joke compared vaccine. dirty anti-vaxxers ones contracting covid point anyway. Check headlines believe me. want protect themselves, try protecting them? Exactly. People fence going look say ""What hell's point?""

Vaccines supposed way this. feels like step backwards. I’m thinking majority “serious states” likely gonna reintroduce masks Fall around Thanksgiving they’re gonna try get proof vaccination system set next Spring CDC budge. political influence prop reopening restore economy. would send basic smoke detectors possible. 

No smoke detectors, alarms, padlocked doors, fire extinguishers don’t work, fire trucks run water…also, ventilators throwing sparks next bottled oxygen bottled oxygen stored haphazardly…flammable materials roof melted heat.

Don’t least bricks? concrete?

This haunting like last fire 3 months ago. Looks like learned nothing. enough evough? Soon enough seeing vaccinated antivax crowd joining together saying lockdowns ridiculous. can't keep happening. rather pedantic point, one might generally expect higher standards BBC:

The BBC puts gray filter Chinese videos? can't possibly.  Amen. I'm sick hearing still wear mask unvaccinated others I'm loaded Pfizer vaccine. I'm sick people telling ""hold longer"" college experience absolutely crushed campus still reopened. 

We never ""all together"". bullshit messaging never true. point, get vaccine get terminally ill, oh well, chance. whatever reason, made essentially impossible entity tell vaccinated unvaccinated. policy suggestion relies less nonstarter. mean kinda get choose much you’re testing vaccine. you’re inside buildings strangers higher likelihood you’re testing vaccine. Masks aren’t perfect either don’t catch everything mucous membranes eyes also vectors infection.

With vaccines pre-delta thing looked like end loooong tunnel almost done pandemic. delta dominant strain - tunnel extended.

I get sentiment “vaccinated good we’re going get” non pharmacological interventions need come back (masks, distancing, etc). everywhere probably need - yet. still tool belt every community. Meanwhile we’re seeing moves reinstate mask mandates. It’s like people living different worlds. I’m liberal previous restrictions mandates. ridiculous. doesn’t incentivize anyone isn’t vaccinated reiterates wary getting won’t get back normal anyways. It’s poor decision morale trust. accept cases go down. Delta probably process taking long, vaccine makers might gone back drawing board.  'immediately unlock everything'

What about, UK kind lockdown 9 months final restrictions due ease Monday.

If unlock high proportion population recently vaccinated (who knows long vaccine protection lasts for?!) literally never will. desperately need avoid another lockdown, among many drastic steps, fear happen. one thing current administration boast 'getting back normal.' maybe two fold. Use Real ID vaccination check (vaxxed vaxxed) literally give said ID every single US citizen, taxpayers foot bill. That’ll shut ridiculous voter ID/fraud lies they’ll pivot find new wedge issue. way everyone gets ID everyone gets vax passport. liberty dies... ethnic group) (dumb members political party) share lot common traits.

Goddamn asinine statement. Imagine people would feel if, God forbid, bunch kids ended allergic vaccines! There's reason process taking long, make sure vaccines work well kids safe them.

Because think antivaxxers bad now, let valid reason arguments! there's office everyone (or mostly everyone) vaccinated masks probably good idea.

I'd say differences bus train hundreds people get route, close together. open floor plan exposes much fewer people there's spacing.  hear you. someone takes care high risk elderly person, “rare” still much  physically demanding job find exhausting. still it, ready done. Especially since work still requiring outside it’s almost 100 degrees headline accurate misleading. would agree case here. every right disagree, minority may accept opinion shared most.

I’m vaccinated back normal already. can’t keep taking one step forward one step back every time cases go up. It’s going happen without vaccine. Vaccines mainly preventing serious illness/hospitalizations/deaths. Let unvaccinated get natural immunity then. Enough this. I’m countries going opening borders anytime soon first thought trolling, actually believe vegetarian protects covid you.   like Facebook that's terrible idea. friend convinced COVID even though never positive test antibody test (this early pandemic). ulcerative colitis years, clearly autoimmune issues, certainly tons problems UC. three long COVID trials basically housebound. 


Long COVID? UC? someone ever since teenager meet ache pain announce world? 


I WAY saying Long COVID real thing--but also see path fibromyalgia 2020s. going tricky. believe precedence set soon since states considering removing it. completely expected. US behind UK full vaccinations, behind terms delta hit.

ZOE data UK started show plateau US continue rise happens well. What's important hospitalisations deaths nowhere near were. 80% one shot Astrazeneca, it’s 30% affective catching COVID-19. Astros Anica predominant anywhere else UK Malta. Almost solely countries. Astors Anica problem infections occurring. Delta. it’s NY border, excellent Excelsior Pass system could use that. Even half U.S. vaccinated, COVID-19 continues kill people faster guns, car crashes influenza combined, according review mortality data. 

The situation improved dramatically since January, COVID deaths outpaced heart disease cancer country’s top killer, according Bloomberg analysis. Still, month June, coronavirus responsible 337 deaths day. comparison, historic average deaths gunshots, car crashes complications flu add 306 day. 

“The sad reality despite progress, we’re still losing people virus,” Jeff Zients, White House pandemic response coordinator, said press briefing last week. “Which especially tragic given that, point, unnecessary preventable. Virtually COVID-19 hospitalizations deaths United States occurring among unvaccinated individuals.” 

Data analysis gathered Johns Hopkins University, U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

After 10 weeks global declines COVID deaths, highly transmissible delta variant driving new uptick. U.S., health officials warned similar reversal may underway: Daily cases doubled low point last month, hospitalizations rising again. 

Vaccines Pfizer Inc. Moderna Inc. prevent many 96% hospitalizations deaths delta variant, according recent data U.S., U.K. Israel. protections even greater taking account effects reduced transmission well-vaccinated communities, data scientist Cathy O’Neil explained Bloomberg Opinion column. 

“Preliminary data several states last months suggest 99.5% deaths COVID-19 United States unvaccinated people,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky reported Thursday. “Those deaths preventable simple, safe shot.”

Falling behind vaccinations

The U.S. vaccination campaign, however, stalled. envy world swift rollout, U.S. since overtaken 20 countries better vaccine coverage, according Bloomberg’s COVID vaccine tracker. EU China, currently administering shots daily rates 4 million 10 million doses respectively, poised blow past U.S. next two weeks. 

Not U.S. vaccinations slowed trickle—just 530,000 day, average—but gap least vaccinated counties U.S. continues widen. That’s left communities especially vulnerable delta. unvaccinated people living low-vaccination communities, threat posed COVID-19 bad ever been.

COVID vaccinations U.S. already prevented roughly 279,000 deaths 1.25 million hospitalizations, according analysis published last week researchers Yale University Commonwealth Fund. report suggests without vaccines, COVID would still topping cancer heart disease leading cause death U.S.—even summer, respiratory viruses typically fade background.

The sudden dominance delta variant surprised health officials around world. Netherlands, cases jumped 500% last week. U.K. Russia reporting highest transmission rates since January. Israel reinstated mask mandate. Sydney Melbourne lockdown again. 

“The delta variant ripping around world scorching pace, driving spike cases deaths,” Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said press briefing Monday. “The pandemic over—anywhere.” definitely time drop airliners. Airliners HEPA filtration, downflow ventilation, air ends essentially fully replenished fresh air every 2-3 minutes (about 50% fresh inflow constantly). Seat backs provide additional barrier little movement people flight. much risk sitting bar cramped cubicle farm office building.

Subways buses, different matter course. Let's say there's group 25 adults. vaccinated, even others aren't, less risk getting COVID. let's say 25 kids, immunocompromised, medically unable get vaccine. one vaccinated, every unvaccinated person poses much larger risk can't get vaccine would healthy adults unvaccinated. 

Also, vaccinated, mean nonvaccinated population still posing risk you. fault unvaccinated many variants decreasing effectiveness vaccine. Considering cases Delta variant here, variant decreasing effectiveness vaccine, likely someday soon new variants arise removes effectiveness vaccine, rendering me, fully vaccinated adult, back risk, thanks unvaccinated adults refusing duty public health

The idea vaccinated, cares everyone else American, individual rights sort thought process lots damage overall public health. care people around vaccinated, pose risk people can't get vaccinated, posing risk vaccinated people well. Getting others vaccinated MATTERS Time ban transport states- especially flights—forget making money focus safety wonder experiences sort thing pandemic enourage work vaccination sort common usually mild respiratory ailments.

Maybe actually ""cure"" common cold helpful guide Irish health service Apathy’s tragedy boredom crime point, drugs work COVID? Cause I've heard ""New drug covid found!"" ""Nope, drug jack shit!"". Nothing seems stick. exactly waiting for? Like cohort people never get vaccinated. covid spreads among them, mutates. go back isolation until...when, exactly? people *never* going get vaccinated. ""pass sanitaire"" end lock people vaccinated. You’re right, I’m also kind OP.

I locked indoors didn’t meet friends fucking year half. Things finally starting look up, I’m starting feel comfortable able public again. unvaccinated idiots refuse wear masks fucking putting us back square one.

It’s infuriating depressing. really, *really* hope stays mask mandate. I’m looking forward arguments fights violence comes enforcement it. It’s upsetting I’m end rope man. us got vaccination hope we’ll start get back sense normalcy it’s suddenly getting ripped away.

The anti-vaccine movement fucking cancer society I’ve lost respect anyone spouts nonsense. pisses end they’re numerous vocal enough we’re skidding backwards thing people still dying. made *so easy* get vaccine. cost, little wait - register sign up.

It sucks. get mindset. I’m mentally prepared another lockdown. don’t know it’ll ever get thought huge downer. white. Always N95. actually wore February 2020 anyone else got made fun costco, people asian, raised usa, couple. chose get nasty inside I'm like dude didnt family teach better that.....!? 

I also got many dirty looks around time eating patio restaurant talking partner bad virus potential societal effect. Crazy think almost 18 months ago damn. wish hadnt accurate anticipating this. reported UK 90% coverage antibodies (vaccines + natural infection); point think pretty clear virus using previously infected vaccinated move around. Herd immunity 'thing.' Best hope high vaccination rate prevent serious disease (and likely continuous boosters).  really, vaccines made people less likely vaccinated old people vaccinated. ""As tests, results faked world.""

Yeah assume almost faith based system steep penalties get caught, like said. I've flown couple times show test results could've easily faked barely checked begin I've heard horror stories others might've profiled. COVID security theater guess call   Read whole article. Twice to. 'ethical concerns' fabricated whole paper big 'trial' showed ivermectin effective. 
Those prominent doctors scientists misled. Get real. million years ever wear mask regularly outside global pandemic like one had. AZ Vaccine quite effective MRNA vaccines. healthy again. rocket science. show covid symptoms, stay home. includes dry cough attribute allergies. many people noticed coughing still going public past months. ""oh fine vaccine"" like that's works, go home stop public menace. thinking would great mind control machine would mind control unvaxxed people get vaccine Professor Xavier real coudl use Cerebus get mass vaccination control every single Covid patient LA county unvaccinated.

PS entire post thread assuming child part 60% population major longterm effects covid. think starting show 20% may long covid 5-10% may life long complications. odds bad  can’t stand DeWine good move. Vaccine requirements cross line terms bodily autonomy. Anyone wants vaccine get one. say someone double vaxxed strongly encourages people get vaccinated. judging decision vaccinate pregnancy all! think that’s extremely complicated personal choice. People winging whatever think best. It’s tough situation. 

I’m reevaluating career decision based fact like many many people various job fields, know I’ll fair amount exposure unvaccinated people. going second midwife birth June mom, dad midwife came Covid week mom due.

I baby another kid young currently vaccinate, preteen vaxxed. able get one Pfizer dose anaphylactic reaction, hopefully covered since Covid March 2020. article makes sound like rule expires October, goes action date. stopped wearing mask vaccination. science says I’m safe. trust it. Ditto. least Vax Card.  feel much. You’re alone. Don’t listen negative comment plates, unhelpful fear mongering. Vancouver lot offer it’s going amazing neighbours able visit again!  surprised...

Glad even admit it. honest - last year half really still sound inhumane? doesn’t really me. least pretend care.

me caring help anyone; bother? tell disagree instead downvoting comment. downvote button isn’t disagree button. put time responding question I’ve tried respectful open. I’ve upvoted every one comments responses thread. 

As long term effects COVID, know “long COVID” exists, plausible potential cause autoimmunity. know people still haven’t regained sense smell year later. know there’s sometimes “permanent” lung damage. think it’s safe say know “more” long term effects COVID, enough know segment population, long term effects likely. far know, there’s evidence long term negative effects vaccine. Doesn’t mean we’ll never possibly discover any, afaik haven’t yet. care them?

For everyone needs hospital services reasons can't get bed. colours quite like Ontario BC beautiful time year. got ideas you’d like visit? never seen media, kidding me. reading 5 ""stories"" every months.

Reflect why? Youre asking us reflect already told you? Lol real. called LYING. Thats shellshocked country.  US Gov't mechanism let countries verify vaccination status. individual States hold vaccine status information, handful states solution digital vaccine certificates. Unlike passport agency, federal entity holds data order issue official document travel. tests, results faked world. Yeah, mess mentally. clickbait revenue mate  feel like many people go this. want kids, elderly immunocompromised deal getting sick, then? nearly unheard children die get seriously ill Covid.   yeah care let unvaxxed die let people want wear mask get sick.

I one question PS5 die? small vocal part population seemed think every province plate someone trying spread germs BC. Instead students temporary workers taking care family legitimate reason there. Truly sad see xenophobia otherwise great city... Also, there's portion population, albeit small, cannot get vaccinated live fear. Yep, July 2019 last time got sick. got vaccinated, wear mine places unless required law. absolutely required test daily. Businesses would require one things. Basically France did: Hear hear!

Unfortunately selfish idiots watch faux news, told covid hoax know long term effects covid? Lmao “disperse pull vaccine” Adults, yes. children. really sad takeaway this. literally it. Well sort gift card (instant reward) whole lottery thing (possible later reward) forget others? 

quite literally yes. Yeah see difference mask city, following LAs rules. Like, it. Nothing else. restrictions people restaurant, closures, nothing. 

It's mask, goddamn, people acting like we're back full lockdowns.  ಠ_ಠ

Maybe people jobs aren’t affected guidelines actually prefer lockdown guess. got new job finally didnt need unemployment (which backed horribly state) finally started hopeful. give I’m actually going lose it. Especially since covid hospitalizations deaths people get vaccine. Giving restrictions people including vaxxed people, actions unvaxxed people, worst kind unfair. Bingo Correct, important difference? thing waiting long-term efficacy numbers, safety numbers. even works short-term, like 6 months, enough mandate semester. matter dumb are, denying access hospitals inhumane. Go live China guess?  Hospitals different animal altogether. responding comment “every company” requiring personally doubt every company able get away it, regardless EEoC says. matter whether legal settled Courts lawsuits, personally think would side people saying shouldn’t required vaccinate.

I’m saying would totally shock me, though… might hold court. would surprise somewhat. So, even high vaccination rates, we'll still need restrictions possibility variants? Let's say get 90% population fully vaccinated, what? still keep restrictions new variant may pop up? Again, means vaccination ultimately pointless.

The young, blacks, health care workers. see heavily voting last presidential candidate?  realize initially choosing get vaccine, one people reckless, right? Good changing mind, waiting point get vaccine available months mind-boggling me. realize children ability get vaccinated right? 

And delta, vaccinated people get spread Covid. it’s idiots need prevention  Honestly, think state general go back requiring masks indoors. 

We *really* can't gambling Delta variant. 1/10 cases also people pre-existing conditions. absolutely SUCKS them.  Wait...who's trying scare us...and why? pick one whole host assumptions errors post, things currently pandemics.  related news: Facebook discovered bad humanity. previous vaccine available them. First infection later last year, first two year.  

Now got Pfizer first dose last month. Hopefully protected. There’s much that’s changed regarding perceived endgame it’s frustrating say least. First keeping numbers hospitals/ICUs weren’t overwhelmed, vaccination rates, what’s next? vaccinated wear them, that’s problem. tells userbase least 100 million, probably drastically so...

That’s means absolute dipshit idea means dont really learn live virus learn live 1918 flu. P.S. -- somebody please correct I'm wrong -- iirc, Israeli study control prior infection.

Which, degree natural immunity thing, would deflate efficacy, comparing vaccinated individuals unvaccinated individuals, certain subset also levels immunity Israel seems stopped there. measures cost, masks don’t. can’t predict trajectory pandemic, work LA public health, think threshold capacity restrictions business closures higher masks. Aren’t French protesting initiatives? efficacy dropped 40%. Thats lie. Thanks! Maybe thats dont understand appeal. Never geocities stuff probably similar reasons. Facebook also awful reasons. 

There’s plenty older people tiktok, platform rewards YouTube style content “post random status life like grandkids posts” content. might reality situation, least report facts.

Delta awful. there's data shows definitively worse. 

I never said pandemic over. Saying unique variable worse every way serves purpose deepening depression already depressed people. Fuck unvaccinated. I’m changing goddamn thing protect selfish morons. Israel data good data lol. well done Biden admin ignoring it.  Source? No. They're saying delta spreading like crazy safe everyone wear mask. 

This honor system wokring. think might get bad bad winter sure. least hospitals, honestly one important things. hospitals run space bad everyone. fill up, vast majority covid patients unvaccinated win book. false? People keep repeating comment replied.  Tinder make vaccinated requirement. I’ve 10 vaccinated patients last 2 weeks test positive…. mean, sort of? we’re reductive that’s basically social media (barring creative platforms like maybe YouTube SoundCloud) since it’s inception.

It’s visual/audio social media young people perfected. keep repeating point someone agree /sarcasm Football really helped boost first wave multiple places Europe. see reason believe Euro 2020 helped well Agreed. right drink pub.  Israel’s data hopefully outlier, latest vaccine surveillance report Public Health England puts prevention symptomatic infection you’re symptomatic, you’re spreading. Please don't.  waaay better rolling lockdowns, imo. Hopefully masks job. one this. It’s someone wearing mask. It’s EVERYONE wearing mask efficacy dropped 40%. rely hyperbole make point, maybe point trash chief too?    tf data Israel internet cranknshit? Lmao I’m vaccinated. I’ve vaccinated since February. I’ve actively encouraging people get vaccinated since refuting anti vax rhetoric. I’m sorry guys want hear serious drop efficacy doesn’t change happened. didn’t want happen, I’m happy it, don’t ignore data it’s right front me. Tiktok numbers bonkers.

For someone like (and probably you) big internet celebrities maybe couple million followers/subscribers. really really big ones low double digits. 

Maybe conventionally world famous sports players singers approaching triple. 

On tiktok, random teenagers influencers double digit million followers, random “nobodies” hundreds thousands, millions. Random influencers tiktok ‘mainstream celebrity Instagram’ levels numbers.

It’s truly insane big platform among younger generations.

Maybe we’re touch lol. weird emergency-authorization requires alternative, less forbidden talk certain anti-parasitic alternatives shown promise Subreddits? 

Isn't weird stock price vaccine manufacturers *skyrocketed* lately? weird happened viable non-vaccine alternatives? Huh. Weird.  going circumstances dangerous someone wearing mask vaccinated serious threat you. Listen man killing never thought please get help rolling masking, like rolling lockdowns. Fair enough, except unvaccinated people stopped wearing masks months ago, ever started. I’m sure see point mandates.  Poster misunderstanding efficacy means. 

The backdrop: [Israeli data showed efficacy dropped infection, efficacy still remained extremely high hospitalization+death (though worth noting data countries generally shows higher efficacy that). 

To clear, great, 64% efficacy mean 36% chance spreading it. means, *relative risk unvaccinated*, would 64% less likely catching COVID. Florida sends numbers CDC daily that's seeing numbers Florida since people looking CDC site see daily numbers there.

Florida DoH still weekly reports. comes tomorrow.  educated biologist, perhaps could explain find 10-year safety data vaccines without testing ten years?

I know that, large trial-population, find outlier freak reactions - find much-later?

Life always risk. can’t forever. according logic, never go, unless rolling masking next years, way rolling lockdowns. members armed forces, rather *Uniformed services* receive protections chain command.

What's endgame LA every person wanted vaccine still feel enough lift mandates? live inside forever? Lmfao ""COVID engineered"" != ""COVID emerge lab""  lol infection control, measure get people vaccinate.  guy can't get enough spotlight  mean even sounds pretty rough.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Federal Gov. dispenses money States. 

the States large control spent  people catch covid pass others. 

True, partially.

Let's group people following buckets:
1. People completely immune COVID-19. catch disease even showering bathtub coronavirus.
2. People catch virus, spread it, asymptomatic.
3. People catch virus, show minor medium symptoms, without hospitalizations need.
4. People catch virus, severe symptoms, need hospitalization, survive.
5. People die get infected.

These 5 buckets exist naturally, vaccine change fact. vaccines do, however, move people higher buckets lower ones. detailed data much improvements are, bucket 5 percentage, mRNA vaccines roughly reduce 1.5% 0.01%-0.02%. Completely agree, think ever see day COVID infections. feel like that's totally window. point, idea COVID go away is...just never going happen near future.

It's totally different past year 
vaccine, reliable treatment protocol, completely novel virus. Social distancing masks literally had. think I’m going end can’t handle anymore. Lmao simple    American - question. Masks effective. Full stop. End sentence.

Why think medical professionals wear them?

Yes, magic. shit wearing them. agree. provide study 40% vaxxed spreading? That's good all. Yikes  Yes vaccines protecting infection doom, life death doom getting back normal doom   truth people wanted easy thoihjt vaccination would that. great months ago delta it’s clear even vaccinated people reign in. Yes, it’s depressing yes we’re tired. easiest thing world right put mask on. doesn’t impact quality life. go see movie mask go bowling. still see vaccinated friends indoor setting. It’s mask public, people babies this? Huh? exact opposite say.

Right now, anti-vaxxers zero burden. walk around unvaxxed unmasked. Risk COVID even burden since clearly give fuck that.

They zero burden.

If actually enforced ""if unvaccinated, mask up"", would burden. One alleviate getting vaxxed. end vaccination levels reach certain point; data, dates, arbiter restrictions eased. Thanks! problem is, there’s way know not. honor system crap county re-implemented mask mandate. Honor system doesn’t work. listen virologists opinion it, there’s extremely little evidence support engineered. mean, *is* evidence. Clearly scientific consensus, evidence none less. fact virus emerged Wuhan, near virology institute studies coronaviruses, “evidence” itself. proof, obviously, enough make determination, certainly “evidence.” mind think people tolerate another two years. Worth mentioning well US isn’t tracking mild/moderate breakthroughs national level. number probably *much* higher… sigh essential places like grocery stores, pharmacies everyone mask up. 

But everywhere else need enforce digital vaccination records entry. entertainment venues, airports, restaurants enforce it. Make unvaccinated people’s life difficult. That’s way increase vaccination rates. 

Of course verifiable medical exemption immunocompromised. 

Not easy know lets go backward responsible fully vaccinated folks. “We could better better” Stop diminishing lived experience saying MASK. …because he’s general. slowing increase case numbers. Masks help that.   Yeah, 1000 20000 concert goers Netherlands got sick covid think it’s safe say shouldn’t shit delta around. And, frankly, don’t think indoor dining either. don’t get gotcha moment youre trying pull lmdao we’ve done reckless shit entire pandemic sake economy. reason can’t get damn food go. didn’t eat indoors past year go guessb Much wrote true. Ivermectin Hyrdochloraquine ineffective they've always treating Covid, experts agree there's literally chance ""lab leak"" conspiracy theory true.  I’m San Diego. Fully vaxxed never stopped wearing mask cautious Delta. particular area conservative full anti-vaxxers, San Diego whole avoided worst Winter surge LA getting 20k cases day. (It still got bad, never went 4k day.)

With Delta, I’m concerned won’t lucky time. Positivity rate already gone .8% almost 3% weeks. :\ Agree mostly. many still fence thought made pandemic without getting vaxxed thinking ""its now."" clear not, many go ahead get jab. one them. I'm tired family mercy careless wreckless people care themselves. Thank - happy hear 😊 Congratulations! wedding late May everyone felt comfortable safe! I’m VA though restrictions lifted literally day before. People weren’t vaccinated (kiddos crazy people) wore masks. reported covid cases. felt like dream people ready celebrate things again! say go enjoy yourself!

Edit: people chose vaccinated go adults making choice take risk. you’re fully vaccinated, can’t worry them. something accept. do, you’ll feel much better going! Infections need controlled hospitalization/deaths need minimal. don’t know else tell you. don’t like dealing do, public health perspective, that’s answer. Masks don’t really cost anything. They’ll always first restriction put last go.  Yeah people going get sick, even Pfizer vaccine that’s we’ve always known (95% efficacy first wave variant). hearing lots vaccinated people hsving serious illness, hospitalization death? haven’t seen that’s feeling positive about. truth matter never zero Covid cases ever lifetimes, probably get it, vaccine help us come okay. That’s people saying worry, sooner accept reality easier road get Sinovac? vaccine doesn’t seem work well others. People still think vaccinated can’t spread disease can’t get sick. It’s part problem. 

People back traveling going sick without regards others. get treated like children act like. science. CDC says non-vaccinated people still need wear masks... Guess what, they're not. first people take masks workplace people tout vaccinated. unfortunate can't trust right thing, done save lives.  people want hear best mindset one expect Corona around least next decade. Imo reason people get burned fatigued ever changing goal posts expectations media sends out. One month, vaccinated wear mask everything back normal, yahoo! next month need wear mask, people dying cases rising. agree it’s annoying. try think protecting immuno compromised people anti Vaxers refusing help protect. Many ic people gotten vaccinated found developed antibodies.  justify restaurants open? People take masks helps spread COVID. bars/coffee? thing since people drink masks. sporting events music concerts? also can't allow happen since people packed together scream. people mask supermarket street basically solve everything? Hi, know internet hard believe everything read (which something do) wife found pregnant day got second shots. 4 months later baby still healthy. Thank you! People forget vaccines 100% effective time honestly annoying point.  I’m aware of. Also US National database. unvaxxed basically younger, 40. DGAF point. CaliforniaCare-ObamaCare they're covered doctor's treatment &amp; hospitalization (which rare rate). there's consequence, health wallets. hate say, way get laggards vaxxed &amp; stop case surges kind punitive punishment forgoing vaccine. would love vaccine passport entertainment venues. even stimulus check who've gotten shots.  get: mandate masks instead institute vaccine passports?

The effectiveness masks pale comparison effectiveness vaccines. fairer vaccinated. seems better every conceivable way.

But nope, guess can't tell people get vaccinated muh freedom wasn’t, probably would worse mask mandate restrictions.   still trust science random youtubers Facebook. Like fuck else going trust regards matters science? Time bring vaccine passports.  stopped wearing mask indoors public spaces though fully vaxxed while. know vaxxed couple got sick recently also gave kid, presumably due delta variant. get seriously ill, hospitalized? no. one still respiratory symptoms, worried maybe chronic sequela. I'd hella pissed came we've gone cause freaking clue vaxxed, variants taking over. ain't lockdown jfc Yeah basically. least presume cheaper China.   understand. content reminds 1990s web pages loaded unnecessary junk. Ok typing realize old.    Masks effective, talking about?  Wrong, loves China. Damn, wonder states poorly educated… funny true. niceties.... LIE. misinformation. Call is. I'm sure ""the vax protects variants, 100% foolproof"" strong anti vax argument. “Despite evidence, misinformation virus's origins continue proliferate. Daszak, worked outbreaks, pattern familiar: ""Every time get new virus emerging, people say, 'This could come lab,' "" says.

What's unusual outbreak, says, senior officials China U.S. traded accusations nation somehow responsible virus.

""It's real shame conspiracy theories get level they've got policymakers,"" says.”

Peter Daszak zoologist, calling lab leak theory conspiracy theory. enough people get vaccinated, case numbers go stay down. Let’s forget though kids can’t get without parents, even want parents don’t bad   Yes. don’t want maskless tourists running around backyard. Brilliant detective work, Holmes. We're tough summer. Doria obviously statistical anomaly lot mounting evidence annoyingly stubborn vaccine evasion Delta - least infection: 


* Active spread COVID military ship 100% fully vaccinated crew members 
* Israel data showing 65% protection infection symptoms 6 months post-vaccination 
* Relatively sustained spread within high-vaccination populations including UK residents 45+ 

On bright side, effectiveness hospitalization death still high death toll among vaccinated remain low. arguably global good would occur vaccine export, hope countries reached high vaccination states offer boosters vulnerable (50/65+) populations coming months.   Limits rights limited. may yell ""fire"" crowded theater call free speech. Government censorship different. attack shoot you. remains seen intruding property without mask constitutes assault. We'll see. Really? talking fairness pandemic? perfect solution here. ones less loss others. 

Also, get it. long year half. going extra 30 days takes fair. 

And way, Im 29. fit category. yeah, sucks. I'll make do.

Edit: 29, 30 two weeks. Fuck sake.  That's practically ad N95 masks. Recovered fully vaccinated supposed platinum plated protection level.    Mmm no, common sense guy. ya, I'm going believe doctor much education peer reviewed, sure dunning kruger effect. look analyze data vaccine little side effects population. Guess what? 99% people got vaccine survived minor side effects. 

That's simple statistics, even need biology one

I think knowledge assuming others know dunning kruger effect though. saying mRNA?   Threat pharmaceutical industry gives kickbacks bribes corrupt politicians name science many things would fathom kid Why?

If get vaxxed mask mandate ended, would reinstating matter?

At point, unvaxxed going moved much. lead reduction vaccination rates goal? It’s “punishment”- it’s infection control, masks without cost economy. LA there’s combination population vaccinated fact there’s increasing evidence vaccinated people fact infect others (though assume hope decreased rate) 

Edit: you’re going downvote me, provide evidence Bringing back mask mandate opposite effect reduce vaccination rates. lot people know got vaccine allowed get back regular life  discrimination finest, creating two class society. Wow knew head racist xenophobic conspiracy theorist hates Asian people? UK Malta could millions cases day

Malta population 500 000 :D

Being serious, Malta popular tourist destination. cases seems among foreign students language schools.  article ""The regulatory agency asking four six months safety follow-up data kids age 12, FDA official said. two months follow-up data required clinical trials adults.""  Spain close we'll soon overtake UK. UK great start longer wait jabs means they'll little lag. relevant due Delta goal get people get vaccinated help

There people getting vaccinated might still asked wear mask situations. imaginary demographic. won’t, honestly, that’s point measure- pure infection control. Huh… hesitation change statute? 
Please tell huge influx severe cases among vaccinated? data point case, link deaths cases broken I’m one them. Due give birth 7 weeks. eligible vaccines. isn’t entirely it’s also people issues get it’ll bad them.

So need wear masks forever protect them?  I’m right you. Supposed getting mid August. sure feel going start rolling back restrictions.

We stop taking leads politicians listen doctors fighting war. UK 80% fully vaccinated population. Heh watched pile chucklefucks yesterday political humor, complaining comic prove claims. think CDC isn’t counting positives unless need medical attention. They’d feeding anti-vaxxers fear-mongers hard data could twist misinformation truth 99+% 40% wouldn’t able tell covid infection cold caused regular corona virus, wouldn’t even know sick all.

Covid-19 something we're going live - much like 1910s Spanish flu, flu viruses floating around descendants original debilitating strain. adapted, virus.

The virus mutation something mixed blessing. Covid-19 originally zoonotic transfer, meaning poorly adapted human physiology. That's makes lethal.
As time goes on, mutations allow better adapt humans - makes virulent (spreads better) less lethal.
Essentially need wait sweet spot lethality sufficiently low whilst virulence high.
At point becomes like seasonal cold.

The tricky thing long incubation period, makes hard contain. That's contained previous outbreaks SARS viruses, relatively short incubation periods, could isolated transmitted. Important remember substantial number people can’t get vaccine health conditions anyone age 12. It’s 100% stupid vax refusers unvaccinated. Meanwhile Ohio: [DeWine signs bill temporarily ban school COVID-19 vaccine  Well, stand corrected regard. apologise. 

Sure interesting technology, particular reasons? advancement sake it? 

Wouldn't safer financial standpoint population vaccinated base vaccine widespread technology instead something that's used, far know, maybe one two vaccines before?  Sounds like easy money me. “Brigadiers” really exist, PM get sweet easy cash. mix many reasons, not. things surely clusterf***.

Granted, somewhat good news today, 1 day, brief note. would take 1 week fully assess situation. probably many variants concern exception delta. article also quote results health ministry published New England Journal Medicine, week ago recall correctly. Nothing truth here. encourage everyone risk analysis least consider facts risks COVID19 vs risks life. I’d curious see numbers deaths Covid vaccinated vs deaths flu vaccinate (flu vaccine) possibility long-term disabilities caused COVID popping years line scare you? couple hundred vaccines researched one stage another. 

Pfizer initial research partnered BioNTech, German, company data looked good.  

Many companies picked expertise in. AcTuAlLy!... notice since covid flu DISAPPEARED!!!??? DERP Dammit sent beef flavored HeartGuard Plus recipe book publisher. can't serious? remember correctly also highest increase daily deaths since beginning pandemic That, wonder many recoverees long COVID true long haulers vs. ones may manifesting anxiety symptoms news around ""brain fog"" fatigue. I'm sure real fucked lot people's lives, surely subset people might become acutely aware forgetfulness start telling doctor they're long haulers brain fog. win,bro. argue dont live reality. 

Have good one! 7-8 week gap (some places cut now, provinces still it). gap definitely helped us make lost time/get lean times limited supply. 

We’re good supply province (BC) kept 7-week schedule hope might give stronger immunity delta cases currently still low. (They’re rising areas though it’s bit race get everyone second-dosed delta take off) let spread uncontrollably healthcare system overwhelmed, virus mutation get worse. Although vaccines working really good lowering hospitalizations, significant mutation also lowered vaccine efficiency. probably would feel lot cautious kids.

Instead, I'm 22 still dealing ""you're invincible, go stupid"" young brain wants finish last college course, finally start career, meet people things 16 months total shut-in.

Everyone's got different circumstances. One person's definition 'safe' might seem dangerous another, part pandemic uncertain. 

I feel restrictions need remain loosened point, still whatever feel's necessary protect family. vaccine passports place place really possible enforce masking based vaccination status offices-- office required vaccine card photos submitted people could go maskless work, actually enforce (it's small company almost everyone already vaccinated) using January stats article published today? Makes sense.  source pls   think children claim care much? Long Beach’s health department following footsteps LA country’s department also implementing one start date hasn’t posted.

Herd immunity delta variant far difficult achieve. We'd start vaccinating children exposing unessecary risk. hate arguments. Even comparison true, mean solves problem. understand people getting vaccinated point simply insanity would course say everyone get shot. I’m putting restrictions vaccinated people though. Especially everyone get shot wants Me, neither! Fortunately that's valid comparison number reasons.

which are? 15 minutes day every 6-8 months get booster reasonable ask, that’s it.

Vaccinated people incubators new variants, anyone claims otherwise either misinformed blatantly spewing misinformation. think case numbers could get extremely high, deaths rise anywhere near used be.

About 50% country fully vaccinated, rough estimate percent already got infected immunity covid 40%. means 70% country already antibodies - another 15% need catch get 85% immunity threshold laid out.

Of 15%, unvaccinated, numbers tell us unvaccinated people young. people die rate much lower general public, vaccinated become infected die much lower rate too. lot cases, far fewer deaths. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Governor Douchey, Oui et oui six months vaccination covid-19 Chile, Ministry Health Ministry Science presented first clinical studies efficacy Sinovac vaccine country.

The results stand clinical study, carried 2,300 volunteers, period time 2% fully vaccinated participants developed COVID-19 0.088% required hospitalization.

According information Chilean media [La published July 15, 2021, 2,300 people 2020 agreed participate phase 3 clinical study efficacy Coronavac vaccine pharmaceutical company evaluated. China Sinovac Biotech, one five vaccines applied country disease.

The academic Catholic University director Millennium Institute Immunology Immunotherapy (IMII), Alexis Kalergis leader clinical trial, together academics researchers Catholic University explained date, low percentage covid cases -19 registered clinical study.

They detailed total number participants, 45 far diagnosed almost presented illness mild symptoms. addition, three people symptoms required hospital care, successful recovery. general, cases correspond older people comorbidities. deaths Covid-19 reported clinical study, researchers said.

Information Chilean media indicates main conclusion study Sinovac vaccine good protection severe cases death new coronavirus also develops antibodies capable blocking entry virus cells (antibodies neutralizers Spike protein) decrease time, dose booster vaccine necessary increase protection.

According study, 2,300 vaccinated, date, 45 infected COVID-19 mildly three required hospital care none died.

Another conclusion immune response developed lymphocytes (acquired immunity), expel virus already inside cell, also generated Spike protein case antibodies neutralizers blockers, advantage vaccine since inoculates complete inactive virus.

According scientists, effectiveness data obtained Chile countries use CoronaVac show vaccine good ability prevent severe illness death caused virus also shows favorable efficacy effectiveness prevent covid -19 symptomatic.

A recent study published New England Journal Medicine also proved efficacy Chinese vaccine.

According research, day 14 second dose, effectiveness vaccine 65.9% prevent symptoms covid-19, 87.5% prevent hospitalization, 90.3% avoid admission ICU 86.3% prevent death related Sars CoV-2 infection.

We've year stop eating exercise months get vaccination. go eating, talking health sizes, lazy refusing scientific data. We're killed virus. We're choosing die, one lazy, glutenous, stupid decision time. factual data say refusal rate young people? thought well 28%. regionally, black refusal rate said 75% -- that's national average. Health care workers said 50/50. know accuracy that...only published.

So challenge 28% number, I'm sure remarkable. lot groups sizeable percentage refusers.

So see original comment implying 100% problem one side political, sorry. keep saying “lockdown”. I’m confused point you’re making. North America, UK, EU likely return something like normal next months, we’ll travelling countries, testing likely extra testing/quarantine unvaccinated. aren’t going locked down. rest world isn’t go awhile. likely continue travel bans latest hot spots awhile yet (ex: Brazil, India, South Africa right now, developing hot spots later). stay

Stay louder people back. never going away. grandchildren great grandchildren coming infections caused COVID-19 immediate relatives. hope like coronaviruses, time, symptoms resemble see common cold.  believed every common coronavirus circulation first started causing pandemic time led milder milder infections much even pay mind viruses nowadays unprecedented Covid-19 wind way becomes minor ailment childhood, leads major case sniffles, fever, sore throat cough days gone. Exactly? care enough get vaccinated rest population. risk dying COVID vaccinated extremely low. That’s point vaccination. know government Constitutional authority mandate every citizen get vaccinated?

Read *Jacobson* Supreme Court case issue. 

If make get vaccinated, make businesses require proof vaccination. Ah must've missed then, gona delete thread. Thanks heads up. time move greenland there's barely cases! rumor going closer September military could start requiring it. know her, Canadian allowed cross border... trump.  Absolutely. placed ban selling medical grade masks public start pandemic, urged people make own, even sell/share local community.  
  
When supplies picked up, could lifted ban. 

A cotton mask way better mask. Data Public Health England underlines importance vaccinations people 50.

All data Delta variant.

\-People 50: Case fatality rate - 0,02%

\-People 50.: Case fatality rate - 2% 

But look risk hospitalization:

\-People 50: 3%

\-People 50: 5,2%

**The difference small.** shows younger people unlikely die even they're hospitalized, still put lot pressure health systems.

**More two thirds admissions delta variant among people 50. 4% admissions age group among fully vaccinated.**

People 50 account 90% delta cases UK. shows older people significantly protected disease far thanks high vaccine uptake among age group.

This data clearly shows 90% uptake among eligible, elderly could prevent 66% hospitalizations. Probably much infections would rare first place.

**Governments really need much possible high uptakes among eligible age groups.**

data paper: heck?? realize Ivermectin manufactured massive pharma company, right? Both, unvaccinated. It’s reduce spread general vaccinated people still spread it, albeit much lower rate. helps protect everyone impact unvaccinated. [What even talking time someone says ""the [establishment] suppressing [something/someone]"", almost always complete utter lie. need search thing 10 seconds find it. Except know, kids 12, people allergy something vaccine, etc. everyone can't get vaccine anti-vaxxer. Proud alma mater!!!!!!! Right? really going full ""fuck it"" we? embarrassment. He's entertainer second rate scientist, that.... reason contradicts dominated Delta variant. parts world bit ahead us. sickening feeling month position. anyone done actual research this? think main determinant vaccine refusal rather openness. I’m willing admit guessed wrong. Hopefully idiots getting vaccinated don’t spawn really dangerous vaccine-resistant variant. 

Me? I’m living life like pandemic. Vaxxed happy. I'm surprised guy vested interest pushing pain killers demonizing Kratom. Much like I'm surprised guy vested interest selling vaccines pushing rhetoric boosters even though there's solid evidence they're needed. India, entire families wiped delta variant took hold there. Cremations happening 24-hours day while.

We Petri dish now.   point deniers ones dying. there's still people want vaccine got yet? data January year, would like see data June, lots vaccines taken last months. 

It Lazy get relevant data report on. Unironically would. Antivaxers always say Measles vaccine dumb Measles big deal. 90% figure adults. like 70-75% currently whole population.  It’s reason. know even dumber? hospital resources devoted treating Covid patients access vaccine choose get it. vast majority, like 95%+ deaths Covid right unvaccinated. So, get vaccine shut up.  terrible situation doubt. beyond pathetic see governor cruelly exposing schools state kids, teachers staff delta covid shits grins. Later says 60% serious condition vaccinated.

Lots possible reasons population vaccined higher probability vaccinaed people exposed virus. think important dispel myth vaccine represents perfect safety, able eradicate virus, popular idea probably causing lot harm good inspiring reckless behavior.

Its interesting dramatically data countries contradicts data United States. would helpful know why. generalizing. like lot 18-29 year olds vaccinated (50%), lot boomers care climate change care people. Generalizing like alienates people actually support causes.  Poor A&amp;W. florida. seen quite vaccinated friends get Covid. mean vaccines work, nope. vaccines 100%. understand people surprised this, especially low vaccination areas. heard it, folks. Gotta pump numbers.  LA lot lose. hurt (except NYC). yes, makes sense health officials would want play safe. 2020 shocked difference scale LA county everywhere else (Riverside, San Diego, etc). I’m surprised they’re imposing mask mandates again.

And paying attention, Imperial County fluke numbers (highest inflected per population). LA County 55x people. Can't say I'm surpised. Never even took mine full vaccination really care. figure?

I *want* kids catch covid, did, odds extraordinarily high they'd fine. know know that. it’s FDA approved business enforce it. Since many people promoting sketchy, tended cite authority experts rather actual evidence, rather surprised attempt provide study showing evidence, surprised find study sketchy. though science CDC say don’t 

The CDC said don’t *have* wear mask. didn’t say *don’t* wear mask. 2022 already vacines children. Everything fine than.  I’m not. theory conspiracy. It’s possible, extremely unlikely requires conspiracy. Same, sinus infection last year that's it.  wish they’d admit made mistake reverse point. 

The current rise appointments might good thing speeds things up. new rush probably fed people would got vaccinated regardless public pressure eventually. either busy, lazy, procrastinating, hesitant selfish. waiting domestically developed Pasteur Sanofi.

You’re absolutely wrong accusations flying around mid 2020. dozens articles, scientific publications, labeling lab leak theory conspiracy. Google friend here, you’re curious. It’ll hard vote reinstates mask mandate…that’s know. Dozens “its gonna het winter bad”. 99% people get hospitalized die unvaccinated. Unvaccinated people also tend younger healthier. That’s recipe winter style surge majority people vaccinated. doesn’t know talking about.  health officials tracked 4,450 ""breakthrough"" cases COVID-19 among Massachusetts residents fully vaccinated disease, representing one-tenth 1% roughly 4.2 million people immunized. 

Nearly 80 deaths. would nice know demographic medical history patients too. immunosuppressed? Older? Preexisting conditions? Either way statistically really small number people compared what's happening unvaccinated people. 

Just little context anyone going read. Yeah, work me. #legalstateproblems Lol looks like comedian.  It’s either vaccine passports. We’re woods yet. think wear masks even spread low there's much COVID around? Ten horrific. hope people listen him.  whole ""better get vaccine know virus"" argument utter bollocks? never ends. government give surveillance state powers 9/11. would give power now? even popular support reddit lockdowns. masks without cost economy.

Do though? many people going think ""huh, masks required, maybe safe go out"" don't?

I know area, reinstate mandate, before, refuse go business work grocery store. contribute economy mask mandates much can. wonder many people this. given covid becomes endemic, we'll catch point, like common cold. changes daily. month could whole new world. “Wearing condom won’t reduce pregnancies sometimes don’t wear one.”
 
See fucking stupid sound? said firm stance you’re listening science, law LA county. sounds awful lot like arguing employee say matter, probably happy deal people saying don’t want follow order. 32 year old recently vaccinated? know came I’ll? vaccine take? risk category?

But unfortunately listen. People either hear said. Say lying. something. fever break around Day 13 first tested positive. lot soreness especially really bad back pain. suddenly went away within couple weeks back normal self again.   Yeah live LA. can’t imagine ANYONE ok shut downs compared last year. Probably opposite... Because... Reasons.

If drive around flag truck probably listen doctors much.  Ironically, 24-year-old planned wait 10 years get vaccinated 30% chance alive 10 years now.

Still laughing everyone refuses believe big problem going October. lot people United States can’t basic math. 48% country isn’t vaccinated, soon school starts people dumb enough send kids person learning, fasten seatbelt.

Enjoy ventilators, friends. got vaccine, good everything on. 

Never mind kids people can't vaccinated could give virus symptoms yourself. Never mind statistics fully vaccinated people getting infected growing. Never mind even 1% vaccinated people still huge number. Never mind know new variants discovered yet know long vaccine even effective. 

Good luck 'cuz gonna need it. microbiology degree believe vulnerable vaccinated? degree require learn existence individual cannot safely vaccinated?

And education fail inform mutations? Mutations you’d helping come fruition providing host carrier? Mutations could cause trouble children 12?

C’s get degrees, eh? ruled investigation happened behind scenes. Saying media potentially tipping people coming seems kinda suspicious. suggestion 

People offering suggestions though. offering fact still course mean people crazy they’re gonna take lockdown well again. Except live another 40 years. Roughly 50% double lung transplant recipients die within 5 years, 70% within 10 years. even worse single-lung transplant recipients. Oh, cool would make claim?

There’s quote article; aren’t saying, “just month get control.” They’ve put restriction place clear end date. ask again: month hasn’t worked comes next? Florida horrible lmao Yeah got vaxxed immediately tier available area, happy felt good part lift announced, within week started wearing mask again. many disgusting people, makes disgusting matter cleanliness, lack common courtesy decency. personally know 4 people supposed count evidence? 

Except 1 little detail, choices affect everyone around you. chose one metric made seems like things going well.

I'd say article mentions quite bit bad overall situation Crushed Six weeks entering nationwide lockdown, Malaysia state Hospitals staff overwhelmed, unemployed going hungry, economy reeling infection rate continued climb, reaching level twice even COVID-ravaged Indonesia per capita Yet Malaysia sped jabs, done little diminish dissatisfaction Perikatan Nasional government’s overall handling virus. year ago, July 7, 2020, new cases country complacency blamed slide meantime, health system crumbling body count rising, burned-out doctors “play God” instances determine Fahmi’s electorate south west Kuala Lumpur, barbed wire food banks street corners part furniture since Avg. daily cases past week: 9,682 Avg. daily deaths past week: 105 “There sense don’t know going end,” said Dr Hartini Zainudin, child-rights activist helping coordinate assistance, said “this lockdown horrible” fallen ”I’m getting people give 10,000 ringgit ($3200) feed 50 families hiring boats get food hungry people islands. mean, it’s ridiculous.

Forever? people wouldn’t you?  takes algorithm kick like right stuff, get really funny creative content page TikTok. you’re older 25, probably isn’t appealing though need hit point society vaccinated person getting covid big deal still live lives. aren’t yet clue happen.  Right, said “controlled” controlled, not. virus ran wild mask mandates place. guys got sick April barely eligible vaccine. Even they'd gotten first day could, would enough protect them. 

They also go kind lung transplant list, assume ""needs lung transplant RIGHT TF ECMO"" goes ahead ""will need lung transplant next couple years"" presumably triaged front. took save children drowning pools wear mask inside, id it. wouldnt you? 

Seems like pretty simple thing keep kids, immunocompromised, can't get vaccinated build immunity reasons safe death deserve.

Also - typically choose get pool. choose get infected covid, especially child. don’t think you’ve read CDC guidelines vaccinated people resume activities without wearing mask physically distancing, except required federal, state, local, tribal, territorial laws, rules, regulations, including local business workplace Fucking toss haven’t vaccinated, body choice. longer responsibility care others won’t protect themselves.  want CDC FDA provide explanation vaccines approved. ever say “it safe effective” ok safe effective. approved? Yeah wish official word someone previously infected do. Like ""If previously infected need SPECIFIC VERSION vaccine."" guessing something potentially life altering real bummer... trying explain situation people actually dont know socialism is, yet cry socialism? Based redpilled Yea really pissed people refuse get shot people acting like everything over. prolonging this. It’s going fly. I’m going comply doesn’t matter I’ve continued wear mask grocery stores shops set good example toddler required wear mask 8 hours day daycare. know people tired masks. LA going poor compliance places like bars restaurants. kids vaccinated yet fully time  true, paid player, may worth cost vs. putting something body vs. virus’s potential complications. 

It interesting dilemma watch, especially $$$ stakes high. twisted ice tea think move vaccination rates? show public health doesn’t exit plan COVID terrify That’s terrible! hope gets better. 😔  see legal issues Reddit, people spout completely inaccurate, confident bullshit relation whatsoever actual issue hand.

I imagine it’s case everyone specialist area. Delta measurably weeks. Nobody long term hurt yet. Almost nobody even hospitalized yet. LA panicking impending hospital crush unvaccinated. Ahh sorry misunderstood original comment. Thought actually saying masks work. 

Yes - CDC fucked there, although honest 99% fuck ups guideline recommendations something came nowhere. luxury extended studies anything sort. time goes on, learn more, change recommendations, even means wrong. Point end day best source info available, politics whatnot. mean ignore them. vaccines carry spike protein Covid uses bind body. vaccines carry stuff like rest virus. 

If spike changes enough it’s unrecognizable antibodies cells likely can’t infect human cells either.

It would need mutate get completely different binding mechanism would even able call virus point? we, that's got vaccinated. essentially removed equation. I'm living fearful life, take precautions like getting family vaccinated. everybody else take precautions. getting sick dying. obviously solve itself. problem covid spread, plenty people can't vaccinated. Namely kids age 12. probably survive spreading more, tying healthcare system, possibly even hitting people can't vaccinated due preexisting conditions. Mind-boggling well, let's shame run reachable. they're willing part help get community side this, power them. 70% safe delta. still wearing indoors. would say 90% places I’ve area still mask mandates. large asian population. curious digging. 2020 December 17th 172 child deaths covid… 356 drownings annually. guess twice many kids drown die covid Look guys, wish thing, rid virus all, also can't shut ears realities virus still infecting immunised people passing on. still 100% agree get vaccinated seems lower infection rates reduce symptoms I'm saying we're woods yet, social distancing, masking hygiene still effective methods have. people want hear disappointing long-term effects virus system still discovered researched, multi-system post-viral syndrome effects really want catch help wearing mask. really hope something simple regular booster shots could solve issue. kids classroom 30 kids ones masked ZER0 good kids unless wearing full respirators. science behind masks collective efforts everyone wear one protect people limiting propulsion exhaust. Frankly Russian really enthusiast either vaccinating there... Sputnik almost ok though without red flags. also two vaccines shady say least. already infected, lot countries recommending one shot protocol anyways.  vaccine potential side effects considerably rare.

Daughter tested positive Covid despite vaccinated. test negative, considering symptoms I'm pretty sure mine false negative. sucks. I'm risk (weight-related, high blood pressure) hope vaccine keeps mild. Yup. putting teams low vaccination rates competitive disadvantage. would NFLPA never allow happen? seems likely types vaccinations already required playing professional contact sports. What's issue adding one more?

Your ideas great, would penalize teams whole. Whatever really target specific individuals refused vaccine. Telling melodramatic downplaying trauma saying affected pandemic well harsh imo. live emotional, colorful world. everything experience black white driven data. one still ICU early 40s. honestly worried. wife gives everyone detailed report every day really much improvement, little, regresses. guy 60s, well now. known 2 people LA vaccinated since April contracted covid. However, cases mild. sick enough suspect covid (bad cough, trouble breathing) recovered within 3 weeks. got Pfizer, hospitalization. really shocked. knew people would still get covid even vaccine, didn’t expect 2 people friend circle get quickly. “Good luck getting anyone listen public health future”

If enough people listen people wouldn’t told mask again. 😂 using vaccine passports better encouragement people get vaccine? swimming pools matter? thing deadlier covid kids care? Covid virus, viruses spread. Swimming pools don't. covid delta variant potential deadly. No, first CDC said masks ineffective needed saved frontline workers. also said travel bans necessary, also dragged feet highlighting effects ventilation versus fomite transmission. doubt, scientists smarter I, hampered politics something. *many* epidemiologists not/were happy CDCs handling guidelines, incorporate **actual** science fast enough, sometimes straight ignored (vitamin D).

Most people follow CDC advice, **do not** incorporate latest science fast enough. Thus original statement. kids could still wear mask voluntarily. 5 year old camp wears mask others don’t. They’re fine it.  *two years later* grandmother vaccinated? You’d say Fauci replacement too. lock down. Lockdowns work long term, especially single county. guess say lock down, shouldn't. Good luck enforcing that.  Even vaccine diplomacy front, they're well. vast majority vaccines they've promised delivered. India recovered quickly Delta? see headlines LA reaches case peak: “Masking helps LA County reach peak faster” 

No one give credit vaccine, unfortunately mask become political symbol ends. know sucks, right thing there's lot people appreciate it. made whole pandemic without getting Covid, part live area people generally followed mask mandates need go out. I'm vaccinated, start wearing protect idiots, I'll it, there's also people *can't* get vaccinated. I'm going let entitled, brainless, idiot.

Strange thing similarity Spanish Flu. Quinine, malaria drug then, popular quake medicine. Assuming live MA, means 2 million folks arent vaccinated. 

Thats enough people potentially getting sick shut hospitals such. 

For US, theres 100 million folks without vaccines. 

Thats scary part me. Everyone talks percentages, actual numbers matter comes capacity things. compared positive vs. total tested ratio NY found interesting ratio right similar around time last year. words, two situations:

- High social distancing mask wearing last year nobody vaccinated

- Low social distancing mask wearing year fully vaccinated partially vaccinated

are relatively terms getting infected covid.

Then looked number daily deaths found that's similar well.

Vaccines [obviously prevent deaths. knew social distancing wearing masks helps containing spread, think would extreme difference.

There still people cannot get vaccinated. big group children 12, bunch others well. I'm still wearing mask avoiding unnecessary closeness. I'm fully vaccinated, me, not. Makes happy knowing I'm making difference, even tiny one.

Just wanted say thanks everyone who's getting vaccinated soon still practicing anti-covid safety measures! 12-16 year olds took dose 16+.

Children much active immune systems adults, need change dose 12. (Obviously 12 arbitrary cutoff, need cutoff). change dose, whole bunch things go wrong, careful. good cautious. rushed (real perceived), really harm vaccine uptake, really need high. means go back usual divisions NHL.

not candid sincere, typically pretending one knows less something one really does. data. 400m infections world 4.1m deaths 10 kids age. Sorry that! Maskless. 

But see there... Yup. friend bragging making $150.00 playing lottery.
 thought myself;""How much money end paying years get that?""  important vaccination BNT162b2 increased protection Delta (87%)** levels comparable Alpha (89%) Beta/Gamma (84%). Vaccine effectiveness hospitalization death caused VOCs generally higher symptomatic infection partial vaccination three vaccines. Interpretation: **Our findings suggest even single dose 3 vaccines provide substantial protection 4 VOCs, 2 doses likely provide higher protection.**

This makes Israel data odd, fit what's reported UK, Pasteur Institute's lab study, real world data Delta-ravaged Ontario. genuinely wonder what's going here. Maybe Canada's longer dosing interval actually proven make difference here. pandering thank someone something helps love? Everyone gets shot helps rest us. Sorry narcissistic realize that. Sanitization often meant simply kicking poor people homes opposed actually building sanitary infrastructure.

Sanitizing cities also heavily linked eugenics early C.20th, pseudo-scientific belief ""clearing"" slums would automatically improve air quality breed ""good character"". 

Working people resisted characterized dirty, uneducated rats rather ordinary folks wanting evicted. US, process was, imagine, heavily racialized.

Looking feedback flush opinion. like 98 it’s 50. sucks mean, think leaders need lead. Like, someone says me, ""we vaccines Americans sitting freezer right here, you, Arthur Bird, want booster dose"", I'm probably going say yes! CDC says, ""it better safer Americans use production capacity vaccinate world, therefore going wait boosters X global metric reached"", I'm going go along \*that\*. 

Going along global vaccination program spearheaded actual health leaders government easy. Turning booster dose (even hypothetical booster dose) sitting pharmacy freezer near variants rage much harder.

Public health programs individual feelings virtually everyone wants least \*some\* selfish things go public good.   66% tho? thought testing asymptomatic That’s diversify portfolio scratch-offs. ""I'm crazy conspiracy theorist, I'm incredibly unreasonable"" exactly better. 
 
Other ""I medically cannot"" really good reason get vaccinated. So, yeah, kind deserve lumped in. Vaccines give lot protection, people overestimate direct protection gives, imo (and underestimate indirect protection lower spread). 

The best numbers Pfizer vs. Delta: 64% efficacy infection; 93% efficacy hospitalization/severe essentially ratio unvaccinated vs. vaccinated. here's means:

If efficacy 70% infection (rounding make simple), 10 unvaccinated people would gotten infected, instead 3 vaccinated people will. 

If efficacy 90%-95% hospitalization/severe cases, 10-20 unvaccinated people would end hospital, 1 vaccinated person would. 

Those numbers great **anybody get vaccinated complete utter moron.** also still mean cases go way (due idiots get vaxxed), LOT innocent vaccinated people going get infected end ICU.   Thanks clarification! yeah, understand never 100%, worried natural immunity would provide significantly less protection delta.

Someone care deeply refuses get vaccine believe Covid Jan 2020 (they also severe fear doctors/needles need overcome). want sure severe risk delta variant try persuade get vaccine. Well, suppose clarify don’t know average case Covid-delta variant worse, Covid-delta variant substantially contagious population-level delta variant poses risk - don’t actually know risk bears case-by-case basis. is, delta infection worse UK Brazil variant, pose risk one likely infected delta transmissible replicates respiratory system? Don’t know sure. 

While wait peer-reviewed data, news reports support seeing hospital setting - is, delta-variant cases appearing. I’m suggesting risk children death, rather long-Covid. know true wife sees clinic. 

The moderator won’t let link news reports, Google “Covid delta variant Mississippi” you’ll see one case example outbreak due delta among kids. find plenty examples looking way - linked others delete them. see academic medical center though - predominantly delta variants, sicker cases. 

Viral load 1,000x higher delta variant vs OG load predicts severity look surges locations vaccine available, (almost?) driven delta variant. 

My point people choose vaccinate increase risk people cannot vaccinate, pisses kids can’t vaccinate risk negligible. 

Also, it’s late I’m going bed Let rephrase - evolve like bacteria do. Nah call BS that. Troll?  Maybe prayed harder 

I don’t get it. 

Do religion whatever, also need take care yourself. One doesn’t negate other. Well guess means people wear shops public transport? government announced activities restricted vaccinated. “I wear mask people won’t” Haven’t COVID, considering job 3/4 hobbies require fully-abled body set of
lungs, I’m taking risks this. Also keep mind we’ve monitoring virus ~1.5 years don’t know long term consequences infection look like, even asymptomatic infection would leave feeling pretty freaked foreseeable future (assuming somehow aware it).

I also pretty gnarly MTB-related concussion Feb 2020 may left undesirable, albeit debilitating, long term side effects. possibility COVID-induced brain damage adding onto doesn’t excite me.

No, really. might lived somewhere low vaccination rates though. That's federal countries though. I've wondered well. Corona virus body created anti bodies. purpose vaccine. Someone please explain like I'm 5   heard one site effects COVID death  people straight posting ""the pandemic i'm tired it"" Ah. stand corrected. protection temporary. theory heard Israel highly vaccined already noticeably difficult compare non vaccinated vaccinated populations. way measure vaccine efficiency, since expose people purpose comparing non vaccinated vaccinated different, exposure totally different well difficult measure efficiency infection.

Those options, neither reasonable option, imo. things mitigate injury even eradicate injuries. There's middle ground.  never factor deaths context health measures (both government proactively taken individuals) reduced COVID deaths. going see huge third wave.

Third wave maybe, increased hospitalizations/deaths, I'm sure. body's defenses antibodies. B-cell (which makes anti-bodies), T-Cell (which directly destroys infected cells), T-helper cell (Which alerts body create B-Cells &amp; T-Cell) major part body's defenses, cell memory known last much longer antibodies years. said, concerned variants mutations evade body's current defenses, may need boosters.

'Nevertheless, ""both scenarios still table,"" says geneticist Chan. Chan says reached conclusions whether lab responsible: ""There's nothing that's smoking gun,"" says.'

There's difference scientists researching origins people pushing narrative racism/xenophobia. I'll ask - what's reason fixate *solely* lab leak origin early 2020 literally evidence pointed you’re learning, read this, it’s good play-by-play went public discourse would media focus claims evidence? would media support narrative that's least likely option arguments are, honestly, kinda stupid. don’t think I’m gonna continue entertaining them. good one.

Thank you. pathetic many people seem forget democracy rule law stands for.

Not pathetic also deeply concerning. ancestors fought wars rights today.

Those people damn horny strong radical leader simply put measures place need leave move north korea.

As said, worse people dont want get vaccinated. dad school work surgeon would constantly tell everyone overreacting masks don’t work every doctor knows don’t work covid flu. Like dude you’re literally hospital people dying every day including dad. Get head butt.  constitutional rights like trample? one state it, 49 others well. may require passing law, would piece cake states majority people officials anti COVID vax That’s irrational all. one sense, wouldn’t say “well it’s good getting information people”, think typical response “huh, motive profit. Maybe skeptical say”. don’t personally believe misleading us profit, science generally consistent regardless. it’s good look, fuel skepticism Damn, know events happened 1000 years go would relevant adays. country constantly trying join Nordic club? Welp, that’s one way eliminate stupidity. culling begun. worried? vaccine protects you, want vaccine get already it. affected party ones refuse get vaccine. self correct issue. either get survive immune die cures ailments. said knew much Delta variant. learn variant becoming clearer need update guidance. Science evolves data...it's static. 

I'm sure many trying snarky say thing ever over. Large number unvaccinated people, visitors means larger number people, risks breakthrough. breakthrough means cases among unvaccinated.

Before ""it's fault crowd comes in"", forget larger numbers hospitalizations puts strain medical services. also likely find immunocompromised patients medically unable vaccinated hospitals, run higher risk catching covid covid patients coming hospitals, especially Delta highly contagious. 

The recommendation masks likely coming issues medical system trying handle patients.  Yep. cure forms death save old age, guns still killing rate. source this? actually wondering this. AC south summer akin heat winter north? make everyone pack together instead outside? That’s calculation works - need assess proportion people unvaccinated vaccinated group 

Efficacy = proportion people infected unvaccinated population - proportion people infected vaccinated group / proportion people infected unvaccinated group  fun reading ya stinker!! Even CDC gives disclaimer website.

How interpret data:

*The number COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections reported CDC likely undercount SARS-CoV-2 infections among fully vaccinated persons. National surveillance relies passive voluntary reporting, data might complete representative. surveillance data snapshot help identify patterns look signals among vaccine breakthrough cases.* 
 
*Data patients vaccine breakthrough infection hospitalized died updated regularly. Studies conducted multiple U.S. sites include information vaccine breakthrough infections regardless clinical status supplement national surveillance.* Dr. Fauci book coming out. Scott Gottlieb Leana Wen former government officials, they're private people now. Gov Cuomo could mad writing book since he's current official. Pfizer Vaccine Granted Priority Review Full U.S. Approval  Immunocompromised person here. :( 😞 Swedish exceptionalism well known estonians already Salme viking ship incident, 1300 years ago.  Age still outweighs comorbidities ton. Also we’re facing unprecedented crisis resulted tons stress. know people react stress? eating spinach hopping treadmill. Maybe that’s RAW, practice it’s different experience employees unionized. think unclear reporting. Priority review means FDA sets goal 6 months make decision (which would early next year point), mean can't aim make decision less 6 months data clear. wonderful news. R 12th wow  Kids people medical conditions sympathy for, anyone willingly chose get die care. Bro, post link article. Thanks, bro. mad washing hands going stop spread covid. Masking proper ventilation will. don’t get think instances Yankees significant. knew along cases would occur, fully expected it. like said, agreed with, unique circumstances players experience, risk reflective faced people. 

The raw number breakthrough cases *necessarily* increase raw number vaccinated people increases. also knew beginning. Likewise, know initial trials numerous follow-up studies protection infection (including Delta), full stop, remains strong, even it’s reduced somewhat. suggesting data doesn’t apply population large, reason? You’d try enforce mass, regular testing people vaccinated, that’s probably feasible — let alone necessary. You’d literally people symptoms whatsoever (either don’t virus all, they’re asymptomatic) get repeatedly tested indefinitely know certitude. Good luck attempting that. Or, could reasonably infer extrapolate based data currently have. fear mongering we’re talking actual deaths? People think go grocery without mask, pandemic over. Clearly it’s not. make minimum wage employees become enforcers. goal reduce overall spread populations say unvaccinated people wear fully vaxxed everyone suddenly say they're fully vaxxed.

Ultimately little bit safety everyone (breakthrough cases much thing) lot bit efficiency.  280 million doses administered, really need know 677 breakthrough infections recruited order draw much meaning report.

For instance, n = 677 sum total breakthrough infections throughout country (which isn't) fantastic, mind-boggling astonishingly successful news!! Nope. That's done along. So? likely outcome both. Mass fatalities achieve herd immunity hard way. One vaccination protect (much) Delta.

Just 50% UK population two vaccinations.

52,000 people tested positive today.

717 people admitted hospital today.

49 people died today.

Stop encouraging voter suppression. Smh Lol, yeah stopped caring people think whole mask thing. know I’m helping keep family safe healthy . thats incivil, thats pure observation.  already it.  they're temporarily authorizing vaccine whose danger sufficiently known

That's exactly goal posts keep moving. People like ""we studied X years, trust vaccine til studied years!"". We've already seen ""it takes 20 years develop safe vaccine"" people one even got EUA. new variants still infecting fully vaccinated people. i’m fully vaxxed i’m getting back i’m still careful, virus mutating like flu find ways around vaccines. protected death likely, still catch/spread covid mutated much. fair. I’ll concede science says safe scenario. Unfortunately human beings involved get situations like [this past 18 months taught anything it’s can’t trust people follow rules try game system. trust test results, apparently. unban them. go well let go, isnt hill want die  Can't make people get vaccinated already? Christ. Yeah agree would perfectly reasonable would make measures pretty similar France. can't imagine withholding care people really need it. England 53% fully vaxxed - yet herd immunity still struggle understand possible benefit flattening curve. Every unvaxxed person still going catch it, risk spawning new variants remains same, stretched longer period time. People gonna get vaxxed, they're gonna get infected. believe people want ""do something"" feel like we're taking seriously helping, inaction feels bad us. I'm fairly convinced none action buy us anything. Anyway, good talking someone who's least willing engage subject. problem. anti vaxxers foam mouth article stating “8 people Vegas party fully vaccinated COVID! See told vaccines don’t work!”. 

However, love ignore still getting sick extremely low percentage 150M vaccinated people.  What's important hospitalisations deaths nowhere near were.

This really difficult many digest. still see endless arguments ""don't know hospitalizations lagging"" ""but UK hospitalizations several months high"". arguing one way another regarding build policy around fact, however data pretty clear dynamic cases hospitalizations definitely substantially different post mass vaccination. Can't read good? government scientific community spreading disinformation?

Looks like Fauci lied every step way along CDC.

So exactly fucking trust? wide

My bigger problem kids. option. reasonable think 2year old going wear mask day daycare. know long implications covid get it. point, vaccines available everyone 12, forcing bear risk people want get vaccinated extremely irresponsible. That's quite correct. Eradication herd immunity might possible reducing burden healthcare certainly is. main problem fully opening still virus huge segments population immunity to. means everyone gets sick time put serious burdens healthcare system. 

So basically agree first point virus endemic, disagree black/white decision lock downs forever restrictions. probably restrictions *as needed* protect health systems. also think even open law, people scared everyone getting sick around them, go back normal even that's intention. Pro-covid anti-mask, anti-vax, anti-social distancing, anti-lockdown fucks got us mess.

I'm sure going about, one post proudly reject science biology time saying safe reopen. singing praises science biology.

Which it?

That's I'm getting at. get flat reject science feel like it, touchdown dances every time agree science.  think reply deleted. pm want. Media scare  good start. Unfortunately, politicians countries bowing anti vaxers stupid reasons. Didn’t french kids get school week ago? It’s fair point, I’m asking timing. agree antivaxx morons. place blame squarely them. enough adults vaccinated got 12 ups vaccinated, probably would better place right now. Hope boosters come time. like idea little kids miserably sick though.  vaccinated, early data Israel shows 64% protection mild infection.

""Mild infection"" still means pass on, care hurray! safer vaccinated.

For anyone cares potentially passing someone else, cares actually getting thing control totally escapes vaccine protection, wear damn mask indoors people. goodness sake scrap cloth, piece iron hammered skull.

It’s put corner, it’s either hyperinflation total collapse. looks they’ll keep things shiny till 2024.

The Arkansas legislature took away Republican governor’s authority order mask mandates, lockdowns. Vaccine passports banned. COVID significantly deadlier seasonal flu, makes sense governments corporations would incentivize workers go get vaccine. Remember, lost tons money already lockdowns people work.

Namely, body autonomy. exact reason must protect woman’s right choose, exact reason fight sexual assault, exact reason drug laws immoral. say happily fully vaccinated individual. know it’s frustrating seeing dumb people preventable is, forcing medical procedure upon someone without consent crosses serious line book. respect opinion strongly disagree.  needs upheld vaccines, too, honestly. someone wants luddite vaccines, kids stay locked indoors. going Disneyland spreading measles, public schooling, conveniences. 

It's fair kids, can't punish whole society batshit insanity people. vaccine = public.

Addison rae cane trumpie recently never uses platform anything five dance moves First good kid, right thing. Here’s issue though, nobody really knows endgame is- everyone learning experience virus together first time. reason whole thing getting extended extended selfish people don’t want get vaccinated whatever reason, gives virus extra life speak. giving chance keep living, also continuously giving chance mutate something contagious, deadly etc. currently happening delta variant. experts react new situation a) try keep many people safe possible b) try stop giving virus hosts replicate mutate in. Missing youth sucks sure, asking “when gonna end” right question asking. Experts experts reason, trust them. don’t know everything, know best.

Secondly, you’re podiatrist working Covid ward also “strains” lab. can’t do? Glendora california 3000 k way unfortunately get fucking shot masks don’t mandated BOOM! CDC guidance couple options depending long wait.  

Easiest option time close wait 3 days, routine cleaning.  Wearing masks large reason COVID even control.

What's wrong wearing mask anyway?

Pick one. Practice preach. never fly US, unfortunately.

The argument masks US seems thing enforced - thing work that's problem. 

Masks offer individual protection society-level protection. want society protection? need vaccination natural immunity.

So quit praying alter mask mandates put pressure politicians push harder vaccination. Releasing restrictions may sound fine people going get caught unwilling get vaccinated (even questionable), kids age 12 consent vaccine yet? variant pops higher risk big problems, able reverse course easily. think main hold-up inability get kids vaccine yet.

Then, US deal impacts many kids catching virus vaccine available &amp; whole 'Long COVID' thing? US decent social safety nets universal healthcare unlike commonplace western &amp; northern Europe, life permanently disabled person much harder. One move country easily anymore either. doubt anyone European nation would want even good respectful Americans provide economic benefit new country. *We US stuck forced fix problems.*

} //endRant 70 people Massachusetts died despite fully vaccinated. certainly concerning. Still glad jabbed, long new variant bumps number higher? still wear mask. People lack awareness. Blocking grocery aisles, coughing sneezing near people. Even blocks 00000.1 percent, better point blank sneezed coughing face. 

I fully vaccinated. released full data yet. yeah 64% number worst we've seen far. sure, almost definitely includes asymptomatic infections, fact would still fuck assumptions % vaxed population required limit spread.

and obviously, higher R0 delta help. neither % unvaxed. Anyone running general lack sympathy unvaccinated?

 Dont get wrong...I feel sympathy families unvaccinated, immuno-compromised cannot get vaccine, young children.... outside that, unvaccinated, chance get US losing ability remorseful knowing know effectiveness vaccine. real question kills americans winter, COVID flu? Ironically anti-vax nuts might finally get COVID/flu comparison trying use last year, except thanks fact many us vaccinated. point solution pandemic let rip population?

Yeah, get tough. virus beginning rip walls vaccines created. looking wrong thing. Look number people skip non emergency care, tests delayed, exams delayed hospitals shutdown parts. hospital exactly peak.

Those people covid, impacted it. diagnosis delayed couple weeks could difference minor sickness major one.

How so? Maybe risk? New long term side effect discovered COVID 

Anti-Vaxxers: “what didn’t see anything”

Rare adverse effect discovered vaccine 

Anti-Vaxxers: “See vaccine toxic, I’ll take chances COVID. Blah blah blah 99.8% Recovery Rate” took covid extremely seriously get anyway even survive i'll nothing show friends way anything like Yes, though rare someone get sick. find plenty scary anecdotal cases, reality is, among vaccinated people, unless something changes worse soon, flu probably kill vaccinated people COVID winter. Like said, can't predict new variant, rate vaccines work COVID really well keeping hospital. grocery store guy neck gaiter face covering tool sneeze... cover sneeze hand anything. greatest pleasure shopping Chinatown markets. **really** didn’t want maskless people stores, weren’t shy yelling ejecting scofflaws. One me, friggin annoying. Sorry guys, Shit ain't yet even though want be. Stop rude people warning you.

Vaccinated people always continue get infected vaccines currently available. point reduce chances. room full vaccinated people dramatically lower infection rate room full people aren't. Mexico part North American continent. geography. Masks full lockdowns choices made made. point solution pandemic let rip population? 

To maximize vaccination rates let rip population? many vulnerable people get vaccinated health immune reasons vs. Idiots? 

Because lots sympathy first second. See, ""just like flu""! /s Lots viruses around though people aren’t masking much. pretty much gone away since we’re masking less illnesses back. test negative could flu similar university exact ☹️ incentives though, money fall tuition getting vaccinated certain date now. good going get continued spread additional natural immunity. that's apparently good enough people here. long, become infected, 1% may die (with medical care bring crisis mode, probably lot less 1% die)[someone tell I'm way here], 30% long term effects ranging mild moderate infected winter, short period herd immunity. next variant may next challenge maybe won't. I'm thinking spring somewhere near herd immunity, atleast months. 
I feel same. work people refuse help dragging everyone down.  governor didn’t wear mask restaurant county allowed county time didn’t meet simple understand criteria disallow it.

Moral story: conspiracy theorists essentially toddlers. actually claim that, luckily enough link source gave watched it, feel free watch it, see statement inaccurate editorialized news original context. never claimed standard care. Storm's a-comin.  CDC wrong you. told us vaccinated infections far rarer really are. virus says so, Fauci. normal people antivax weirdos. adults vaccinated good go point. CDC says still follow local business rules. 

Fully vaccinated people resume activities without wearing mask physically distancing, except required federal, state, local, tribal, territorial laws, rules, regulations, including local business workplace provide damn thing useful. Antibody protection. Natural immunity via infection still effective. Seems like dumb way it, put strain health systems, happen.  long air one bedroom apartment rental someone may delta variant left it? reverse it. Actually start enforcing it! Stop pussyfooting around anti-vaxxers. France's president said ""To hell bullshit"", look instant total 926,000 people, 35, booked jabs since French president’s Monday evening address**, Niox-Chateau said. health minister, Olivier Véran, confirmed almost million appointments booked, “which means thousands lives said 21 July anyone wanting visit theatre, cinema, sports venue festival audience 50 people would need show health pass proving either fully vaccinated tested requirement extended bars, cafes, restaurants, shopping centres, hospitals, long-distance trains planes 1 August, president said.

Super easy convenient it.  lot idiots per capita US though. Overall vaccination rates proves that. “Doctor”  lack care people left die due triage, subtle quality care. Sigh. Nothing ever good enough seems. Vaccines end game. It’s enough people vaccinated. bit?

I think 90% figure given recent press conference can't find transcript for, recent article Times Malta figures nifty lil' graphic.

1212 active cases, 16 hospital. think anyone worried recall dad always telling social security numbers mark beast lmfao get comments here, fully vaccinated people saying ever wear mask again. I'm fully vaccinated wish CDC never lifted indoor mask mandate. Yes annoying everyone wear masks again, big deal?? piece cloth. I'll probably always wear public transit now. Turns out, none people honor. masks people use touch multiple times day dirty hands absolutely worthless, even harmful. 

Is post February 2020 still thought COVID primarily transmitted formites? excuse wear masks proven wrong well year ago. ""Before facts in"" 

Facts results change observation. Originally data indicated benefit treatment. However, statistical analysis found provide enough positive impact. realized people would discharged earlier kept hospital order complete treatment. 

It make people worse, statistically improve average case justify additional days hospital complete treatment. Sit hand, look away article content makes headline seem much worse things actually are, christ BBC gone shitter. 

Younger people hospitalised COVID similar rate organ damage older. Headline kinda ignores fact it’s much rarer younger people hospitalised COVID first place. Lol. got downvoted shit month ago saying y'all patting back early. time, national 7-day average never dropped 10k new cases per day--our 7-day average never dropped 150 deaths per day. numbers would acceptable first world country except own. hey, got stop wearing masks public weeks. also premature masks need even knowing sars transmission.

Could helped less spread covid little saved life's masks work pleasant wear

You probably wearing poorly made mask. They're fine wear. problem! got email morning! find record. Lovely Yes. Implement strict capacity limits restaurants/bars/events. Vaxxed patrons count limit required mask. yet vaccines, way effective masks, stop-gap measure vaccines ready. Unless vaccine shot sorely disappointed. worse there. state 70% vaccinated. 

No state 70% vaccinated. Though Vermont think kinda close. 70% eligible adults getting first shot 70% people fully vaccinated. virus care kids approved shot. Stupid. stinks. looked back month Pfizer’s submission 12 approval. Wonder one much longer? lmao, right? guy thinks LA bad gets he's rude awakening. Makes sense. I’m also freaked out. got 2 Pfizer shots back April/may. sure believe anymore surge delta I’m kinda worried we’re going another repeat last year. Im sure talk another surge coming something worry not. Craziness. dont literally piece cloth, chill out. article unvaccinated adults children 12 giving Covid little kids. course babies cannot wear masks. respiratory systems developed enough wear masks. 

Adults ***adults*** ***protect children***. want get vaccinated, ***adults least wear masks***. 

This goes children sufficiently mature wear masks well, ***which adults house.***  never fly US, unfortunately. 

We could easily require schools get airplane, put full support federal government behind employer choosing require it. many things could doing. like outlook. falls usual trap ""blame single entity solve everything fix it/get rid it!"" historically never worked.

Even education perfect, peers, people's parents, online conspiracy theory communities take priority everything learn. arrogant parent immediately ""correct"" child things learn school, child recognize things school match things told home... must lie.

The problem multifaceted, complicated, easy fix. I'm better education, panacea misinformation thousand different sources roots problem. 
Nice little graph first dose age group, cumulative increases. 
The 18-24 age group vaccination rate dropped 60% last two weeks. 

Definitely running willing arms, rest get immunity natural way. Literally study confirms this. baack!  think would still help did. Masking go back lot people would feel lot less social pressure go maskless they'd rather wear one shopping work. Honestly protocols much less legal enforcement social pressure. Department store mask policies never got arrested without mask, go see people masked, people follow crowd protocols mask too. problem getting critical mass threshold makes conformity possible Fauci made habit opening mouth facts in... like mask effectiveness fiasco.... undoubtedly led people dying someone love actual emergency hospital can’t anything beds full. Blame anti-vaxxers keeping reproduction rate high. wrong except one point. countries open vaccination like America. countries yet get single vaccination arm.

It good thing US starting export vaccines. years away every country enough vaccines anyone wants one. still got covid w/ jabs Pzizer, tho thankful it.
Even tho sick bed 2 weeks, kept hospital  Again, thank answering.

I get choose whether I'm testing vaccine not. argument whether unvaxxed people get infected quickly flatten curve interventions get infected longer period time, number infections going happen. everyone either going get vaxxed they're going get infected naive immune system. risk shorter time less risk longer time, ultimately difference risk.

Now, argument vaccinated person want mask take precautions unvaxxed people infecting vaxxed, that's 100% valid decision individual make. society wide mandate things make number unvaxxed infections take longer period time happen. vaccines, flatten curve, prevent infections happening. believe flattening curve necessary worthwhile area without threat hospital capacity. Scotland's relatively low hospitalization rate Delta wave (about 60% lower peak hospitalization despite 40% higher peak cases wave), high levels vaccination among vulnerable demographics, leaves optimistic hospital capacity (20% vax areas like southern Missouri excepted). Good you, stay home. “The new ward space 70 beds built three months ago, medical officials told Associated Press news agency.”

“A medic hospital, spoke Reuters condition anonymity, said building lacked even basic safety measures.”


That’s sad. economic situation must rough can’t even properly build ward. EXACTLY point. Chaos. hard concept? Nobody wants sued federal court violating First Amendment. That's reason religious exemption. 


But get people calling saying ""I want kids get vaccine. get religious exemption *I* believe it?"" would like hear people's opinion gave vote comment. Used half country left, half right. third category people want pandemic handled common sense. Coronavirus going count GOP one victims. think done differently?  incoming UC student, required provide proof whole list vaccines allowed campus (Chicken Pox vax, Meningitis vax, etc etc), different.  course antivaxers ones responsible prolonging pandemic. like they're passenger seat jerking steering wheel rolling eyes uptick car crashes. investigation happen behind scenes, consisted going lab asking questions labs protocols such. Basically asking lab investigation self report. Obviously lab said ""Theres way lab leak"" that. took word scope investigation. 

One members investigation team Peter Daszak. 

Daszak actually heavily involved WIV collaborating basically organizing $700k tax payer money given WIV undisclosed research projects NIH. 

Daszak also part Lancet, perhaps world’s preeminent scientific journal, published statement February 2020, relatively little known coronavirus. statement declared “solidarity scientists health professionals China,” virus originated sometime late 2019.

“We stand together strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting COVID-19 natural origin,” Lancet statement said.

This article whole lot info, actually research done Australians showing lab leak actually likely scenario based virus infects different species. Daszak heavily involved bunch pharma companies dating back decades, general done everything power absolve WIV accountability scrutiny. going backwards?  No, understand wanting feel way. matter, want vax. country fucking dumb. masks NEVER removed... EVER. US never reach 85% herd immunity except particular counties states. Certainly Los Angeles, see new indoor masking mandate coming Saturday. time CDC pivot mass vaccination herd immunity vaccines prophylactic want protection. would take booster every 4 months could prevent 95%+ covid variant infections. others feel need protection, fine. care. think it’s really strain. Maybe little contagious overall something worried about.

Like said live state care masks vaccines literally all. bars open packed shoulder shoulder. isn’t huge massive outbreak filling hospitals killing youth. think it’s important young people focus mental health right now. definitely seen negative impact due quarantine ... starting? Right! many people sound like whiny bitches. Oh wear fabric face short period time ever live cruel world. Besides vaccine stop catching covid lowers chances. like using umbrella rain, keep mostly dry still get wet. Well, I’ll sick 4 days, worst second shingles shot worth it. Besides christan science small sects, major religion vaccination. would become huge opening antivaxxers say "" cause God told so"" oldest age yours. feel betrayed. kids sacrificed much this. district requiring masks everyone, vaccinated not, requires weekly Covid tests unvaccinated people, including students. Hopefully help, feel like parents children forgotten. anyone says kids low-risk thats still no-risk knows long term side effects, it’s frustrating. Lmao pandering 😂😂😂 Yeah rest life Earth deserve that. Maybe sort plague...no wait... I'm sorry family failed spectacularly. deserve this.   Nearly everyone know got vaccinated soon possible still wear masks inside. reason too. Vaccinated people still carry virus pass unvaccinated immunocompromised. push mandatory vaccination instead. Many thanks!   live LA. find place neck woods take you. PM want it. Thank answering. 
Do believe delta variant virulent think dangerous? least wait untill everyone wants vaccine fully vaccinated?

Don't hasty friend, little patience Ravaged whopping 14 deaths per day?   extremely rare booster vaccines may modified specifically target contagious strains. know what's next mean work work, unknown.  internet friend it’s filled people help achieve lot things. starts though. give become want require hard work suffering ultimately less suffering living life don’t want. Best luck. Less think. 

Previously Covid thing, average lifespan person lung transplant was, neck woods least - seven years. 

Now Covid world would less. immuno-suppresants keep transplanted lungs rejected. means stands vaccinated months efficacy vaccine reduced (due immune compromised status). 

And would think means covid another kick comes people like him. 

The people put vaccine hesitancy thoughts blood thousands like hands. 

I hope reckoning people made suffering worse. Good Haven’t lost anyone, know got sick.

Low vaccination rate, live state doesn’t care.

The “delta” variant hyped strain used boogy man right now. likely story. reason think it’s case feel good assuming vaccines work.   Delta variant, Bay area hospitals finding 15% admitted patients covid vaxxed. 2 3% uncommon. bet huge number elderly anyway compromising illnesses. Tell it. senior COVID hit. Lost prom, graduation, senior summer, entire freshman year university. I’m usually dramatic one-sided, I’ve recently made choice cut anti vaxers life. absolutely empathy kindness people. stop taking away best parts life, happy befriend  2020 throw-back party.  Point order vaccines mandated many things. Sure required school never life employer ever asked see proof MMR, Whooping Cough, flu. interesting 'real' pandemic hits.

Now, rebuttal anti vaxxers is, well still spread cause case numbers increase still forcing mandates restrictions, point? thought vaccines savior returning normal?

I actually don’t disagree statement. going case metrics misleading. coworkers wearing masks 8 hours day year. None us ever sweated much......

I mean work indoors ac helps.

There bunch options though. cutting edge type stuff coming takes comfort heart lot 3m n95 masks. remember argument. supposed thrown free car, guess land crouch like spiderman, go sandwich. what's actually happening? would take US media reporting China grain salt, everything Evil China sensationalized X 10.  


Are people left die street, what's actually happening can't work hospital vaccinated? latter, unreasonable all, course spun people ""denied access"" hospitals, technically true misleading.  Shit, third don’t want get vaccinated either. anybody know natural immunity gained O.G. SARS-CoV-2 provide immunity Delta variant? early tell? There’s entire army people dedicated deliberately misinforming people unfortunately. make money chart saying average 337 people died PER DAY month June. think figure likely includes symptomatic asymptomatic vaccinated individuals, since didn’t specific data. 

If figure asymptomatic, it’s still good news, many vaccinated individuals get infected asymptomatic. 

If figure symptomatic, it’s even better news, figures fully vaccinated (not partially like analysis), asymptomatic individual probably even lower 40%-50% stated. safely get prosecuted? He's safety hazard work small company retaliation rule exception. People 40s usually die. Regardless, goal places (note case everywhere) let old people catch COVID all. Slow steady wins race. antivaxxer I've vaccine since April? Read comment see I'm actually saying instead trying figure beliefs Pfizer 64% effective preventing infection delta variant 90% effective keeping mild arent numbers I’m particularly love tho This. I’d support it, who’s going enforce it? Minimum wage employees? don’t support that. Check vaccination cards.

The country awash fake vaccination refuse service.

Ah poor retail workers forced law enforcement duties gun, authority, badge, backup whatsoever anti vax/anti mask mindless idiots spew rage assault cases kill refused entry store!

And risk lives princely sum 7.50 hour so! Get hurt, hospital bill course! Hello Canada; we're catching fully vaxxed rates safely say nobody know thinks UK reopening fully danger world.

Vaccines work, people get greater overall effect. Delta true danger low/no vax countries; two countries. Anyone else really beyond giving shit?

If you’re vaccinated you’re kid, COVID different common illness goes around. Grab blanket ginger ale, pop Tylenol, cook chicken noodle soup put favorite movie. Stay home days. You’ll fine.

If you’re unvaccinated adult, fuck around find out. pandemic unvaccinated now.

Unless start seeing vaccinated people dropping dead left right, I’m changing anything lifestyle. still see ""If pick certain age range, cars kill more, COVID matter"". cherry-pick stuff like that. matter, death caused covid end day. doubt still sense smell. Yeah, lets get vaccine normal trials usually takes several years pandemic happening. /s general public. I've vaccinated. everyone needs wear mask refusing acknowledge science though. get want maskless, you, protecting stubborn, science-hating people. Think children elligible vaccinated, think immunocompromised much higher risk, think medically compromised people may allowed get vaccine, think people still recovering COVID/Long COVID, think people desperately want get vaccine due availability timing, able to. lucky enough pick 10 different appointments single day choose from, live somewhere lots vaccine clinics choose from. people may luxury. still know several guy: ""I'd rather get thrown windshield maybe live get trapped car seat belt burns alive. Seatbelts dangerous part. lord says time, time."" Dude sounds like sovereign citizen    Please disappoint me, 2022 say realistically. difference burden risk put onto anti-vaxxers. single argument care holds water JFC  ""I ain't guinea pig, let catch novel preventable disease like God intended!"" /s live LA I’ve vaxxed since March. I’m shaking I’m livid new ordinance.

People love act like masks aren’t big deal absolutely be. put year, months fully vaccinated knowing nothing security theater.

We barely got life back month ago day. year, barely got gym gym classes back. finally felt like worst year life. Finally able live normal. went dancing bar once, last weekend 4th July. 

I could care less protecting people could vaccinated choose to. end goal point? can’t forever. degree ""fear""? I'm saying people right actually see CDC guidance enforced.

""If vaccinated, must wear mask."" 

That shit meaningless right now. Make meaningful, let vaxxed people decide activities want engage in, whether voluntarily wear mask indoors, etc.  got vaccinated another state moved CA. Submitted info CA system, still says there’s proof vaccination.

I don’t see it’s hard organize federally. We’re shooting foot misguided fear privacy violations. CDC tracking whether true not. bot? ends spread low enough word caution. Never infer malice incompetence sufficient explanation Nope, backed medical data elsewhere like said, vaccine companies considering boosters. Boosters required vaccines, known thing. stories I've read elsewhere also breakthrough infections people still glad got vaxxed would drop masking distancing quickly. *trying* post one r/Amazon-Prime-package posted, effed up. critics lockdowns. Aust/NZ denying reality ""living virus"". Australia New Zealand adopted different strategy rest world dealing COVID. means COVID zero within borders, sustained lockdowns community spread arises. meant past 18 months life normal (mass gatherings, masks, etc.)

This works two things well:

\- maintain airtight border

\- case sneaks through, lock quickly enough stamp out.

This approach never last long term (unless NZ/Aus. want permanent hermit kingdoms - tell true human cost would add eventually well) idea buy time vaccines minimal illness death. think front amazing success, compared rest world. Speaking someone elderly family living NZ, grateful strategy adopted.

The issue they're locking (we argue fact NSW slow lock hard enough) - that's strategy taking course they're locking down, issue vaccine rollouts countries terrible. discussion boosters approved US Pfizer even fulfilled obligations sign (let alone countries waiting Pfizer, like Japan). seen (for example) recent weeks SK govt get creative negotiating supply deals w Israel try solve problem independent Pfizer. Australian/NZ citizens wondering governments doing, much like SK govt doing, ensure expeditious delivery vaccines.

There fact urgency deliver vaccines Delta changed game higher infectiousness. seems much likely break border quarantine, hits community almost zero population immunity, spread like wildfire dry forest. seeing beginnings NSW state govt trying get control.   right. Changed it. difficult understand realise vaccines supporters, even despite tons articles researches. vaccine you, protect symptoms disease. prevent spread virus.   listen rules hope CDC comes tells LA County cut bullshit. anti-vax agenda grounds ""Why still wear mask vaccine supposed effective?"" stands now, benefit mask given whether person actually vaxxed! like anyone actually checking.

Right now, unvaxxed person gets additional benefit, vis vis masks, getting vaxxed. question is, what? vaccine still mitigates infection, full stop, extraordinary rate, reduction case severity even greater still. going panic live terror there’s still *some* chance (assuming we’re vaccinated here) could catch probably amount cold/mild flu? even smaller chance severe? even smaller chance could hospitalized? even smaller, practically infinitesimal chance we’ll die? 

I don’t think ever asserted there’s absolutely zero transmission vaccinated. It’s nuanced that; rate transmission vaccinated, likely far lower, still nonzero. Again, going haggle “nonzero” rest eternity? anyone predicting close again?  I’m gonna whatever - can’t imagine goes well people here. I’d booster day. Done flu multiple times. worried all. Tbh, restaurants bars lose lot customers. people lose jobs doors eventually close. small family restaurant isn’t going put public health livelihood. Yes, agree saying. meant *actual scientists* make conclusion happen, due lack evidence, may suggested unlikely. media always bad job science.   know 20 people got 5 died. Sorry I'm little doom gloom I've seen worst thing do. Don’t bummed. something it. Protest. Call county officials. they’re going get vaccinated live restrictions forever dumbasses let die could instantly proven wrong getting people vaccinated making people wear masks.

This scary believe, mother lung disease.    I’d bet correct answer many. 

Being told freak worry you’re young you’re extremely unlikely mild unless asymptomatic. apathetic attitude persisted. Especially since lot states vaccines opened groups couple months ago, vaccines booked weeks.
