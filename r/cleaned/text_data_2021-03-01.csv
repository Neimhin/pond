0,2021-03-01," ridiculous. That’s like saying don’t post pic nice vacation dinner partner someone can’t afford doesn’t partner. no. mask restrictions absolute last thing lifted. 

It’s minor inconvenience compared anything else.

This tripping finish line America bad need $$$ ... ignore man keep wearing masks. trying guy, already mutations vaccines work on? No. It’s approved due delivered next month think. problem. I've following since started. 

I've seen enough action/reaction states point spread intentional among significant portion neighbors.

And continue be. one hand, oh joy! There's restaurants border miss I'm vaccinated

On hand, shit. Texas gonna inflate numbers Grisham gonna tighten two sides would be:

 makes immune still spread covid 

or 

it makes immune stops spread think ""You still need stay home vaccine"" misinformation.  Right? Mad respect! kept hearing subs place doom gloom bastion negativity anyone trying hope shot down. Well came saw exact opposite. cases maybe things far side. Maybe came doom gloom days. maybe came vaccines came around save us all. Yes haw? Look, reasonable level skepticism large pharma companies. reality company that's around nearly century half going made mistakes, pharma particular riskier business comes potentially harming people.

The wikipedia article even mentions they've proactive recalls not, even fault (the Chicago poisonings), clearly mixed bag them.

But worth, think company going want intentionally something violate public trust COVID-19 response literally entire world watching every move right now. Good. I'm excited go college. Losing senior year worth normal college experience. People decided since there’s vaccine, covid longer matters. Many subreddit screaming rooftops going “done” covid soon vaccine released. Makes sense  40 days soon IMO. know severity disease seems linked blood type somehow, maybe also impacts reaction vaccine? Seems weird would, maybe. coworker mine lost sense smell taste today. She’s vaccinated; am. concerned be? around without mask. unvaccinated person household. Chris Whitty UK stated before. Paraphrasing, goal getting COVID comparable manageable flu season, ""it's level risk society can, should, tolerate"".  could also design cars go 40 mph, would save lives

You're literally describing speed limits

I guess means matter time selfish ""fuck everyone else wanna want"" crowd tries get banned too?!?! want risk hit yahoo going 120, use safer car simply go worried, huh? city plan 80s-60s done July ""2 weeks flatten curve"" said done with? goal open hospitals arent overwhelmed. don’t know people getting idea goal open things math right? second dose taken 3 weeks first dose. elderly hugging grandchildren two weeks second dose would 35 days days since initiating vaccination two sides would be:

 makes immune still spread covid 

or 

it makes immune stops spread 'The COVID HOLIDAY SPECIAL!""

""Yeah may horrible disease killed ton people hey, least Chewbacca's family"" NY variant gonna issue another wave. already happening NYC, numbers starting go back up.   Yeah going end well Texas, many times need happen people fucking realize need wear mask. company nothing stop customers without masks, I’ve stopped helping them. It’s fucking rocket science. Australia bars constantly packed, wonderful also kinda sucks bc takes forever get now. Even covid-cautious people know starting done, hitting 1 year mark. Britain invisible force prevents elderly hugging grandchildren second Isnt vaccines supposed do? America going start mentally coping idea America going crippled Covid next several years, even vaccine, several states actively choosing allow spread mutate. Barring bold change federal government's approach, states continually set us back potentially endanger world new mutations uncontrolled spread.  Sigh shot can’t come soon enough Yea. Sounds like data pretty much everywhere inconsistent can't really trusted. Jeez, think 2021 we'd half-way good this...  rational reasonable position.

We need objective, engage objective decision-making involves calculated risks, like things. pre-pandemic era, took risks like driving 1000 miles winter visit family Christmas. risk actually pretty high weather bad. But, trusted one another make decisions; decisions *did* affect one anothers' safety, since cars road snowstorm raises everyone's risk level together, probably exponentially.

I hope find middle-of-the-road rational way make restrictions, despite absolute cringeworthyness misinformation, hope drop censorship soon safe so. Frankly, think productive let people say incorrect things socially punished (and hundred people show explain readers *why* they're wrong) simply silence them. US' vaccination campaign advanced/done July hope guys distribute spare vaccines us. Bolsonaro we're fresh ground new variant outbreaks could pose global threats. 

The saddest part lot population stupid enough support haven’t heard anything vaccine resistant strain.  yet, masks social distancing killed flu. Funny acutal facts work compared sad selfish feelings year later right move. done worked. COVID still everywhere. Texas see rise cases coming weeks months? Absolutely. also first state back ""normal"" point seem goal anyone else. Ohhhhh scary

Give jabs lockdown Thanks confused this. also symptoms severely reduces chance transmission. transmission rate low enough virus die eventually China post amazing. hospital capacity. never go surge like past winter (barring unlikely mutation). Hospitals stretched overwhelmed. states stayed open overwhelmed. It’s becoming obvious interventions mainly theater. Vaccines ramping immune population. excuse J&amp;J least publish roadmap, dates, normal. ASAP. April every day it’s looking increasingly likely vaccine public anyone.  least it'll provide good look results states want follow suit. Hopeful starting chain dominos. administered 67% vaccines supplied, lowest rate too. next sub r/postcovid already do. new reservation system said plans get rid Covid ends. That’s especially great hear consider ready jail stay home order violator Thanks bunch, **[REDACTED]**. haven’t vaccinated still careful would suck catch close stabbed. that? Get back live!!! Soooo jive county level mandates? Huh? expected? else would use? Masks work flu. well-established scientific consensus going back decades. Social mask wearing long established effective containing spread flu. protect others. 

Also, also long established outbreaks respiratory viruses driven asymptomatic people. Fauci said back spring long history virology known theoretically possible asymptomatic person spread respiratory virus, outbreaks driven them. 

So wearing mask without symptoms equivalent wearing condom sleep alone **just case** Lol yeah look countries got control last year longer deal lockdowns! must really like making international news reading recently new Ebola outbreaks DRC Guinea aniexty probably got best me. also help recently watched movie Outbreak Dustin Hoffman. We've much shit past year, honestly surpised nature something like us. know nothing science virusues judging amount downvotes comment, alot people feel way me. Annnnd got half million dead Covid-19. Oh work production making meals homeless pretty chill way. Customers sound awful right now!  would love become socially acceptable also encouraged wear masks you’re sick public, even things like colds flu. Sometimes people need work they’re weather doesn’t mean spreading germs making entire workplace sick following week. Social Darwinism refers various theories emerged Western Europe North America 1870s applied biological concepts natural selection survival fittest sociology, economics, politics. 

After mayor dude stated strong survive state owes nothing, well... obvious cult mindset based upon. start building 2020 Wouldn’t incentivize getting coronavirus? Yeah agreed. Thats simplest best way put it. Clear point. Can't misinterpret really \*MAY\*

&amp;#x200B;

or not... Yes, concept able save lives small harmless actions makes giddy. would like think makes people giddy.

Are suggesting opposed saving lives small harmless actions?!?!?! I’m sorry, fuck that. limited lives would save worth it. 

We could also design cars go 40 mph, would save lives. ban fast food? would save lives. Fill every pool, pool drownings (which kill kids covid easily) Hell, get rid motorcycles. 

I’m willing bullshit every winter fucking flu. wear mask, don’t care. Yes technology, I’m talking specifically vaccine development. normally takes years

It’s rushed.

Rushed shit sucks

So thank bringing completely irrelevant fact conversation 3 million million?

Sorry, I’m dumb Can't wait things get better travel go see family long time. almost certain involved chain disease transmission ended killing someone never meet never know about. Welp, guinea pig literally important one.

If Texas quarantined I’d problem b y’all gonna go around US. inexcusable. doses distributed good prediction doses administered days? Ah Great Diamond nice, though quite friendly Peaks. peaks actually friendly. ;) literally not.  need protein fats survive. article:

That Greeley plant one early hot spots pandemic. Six deaths nearly 500 cases COVID-19 linked plant since last March, according Kim Cordova, president local UFCW union represents plant’s workers.

“They front lines since day one finally opportunity access vaccine,” Cordova said. Thank god. Hoping states follow suit. got first Pfizer Sunday afternoon. Sore left shoulder, nothing else.  Towards summer months though little reasonable. 

Lol towards end summer. another 6 months missed summer. thanks.
   want virus mutate even completely vaccine evasive.
  
You realize virus still spread around 90% world right? think Biden going completely shutdown borders 100%? best case 17 million level immunity— 58% population **not close** ~70% needed herd immunity take two whole weeks 7 million one shot get 70-80% immunity.

Again: fully opening kill people. take long forget difficult read trump quotes. can't string sentence together without 5 tangents yes Also apparently kids younger 12 don’t spread covid effectively don’t symptoms severe. Washington, open anyone 50 older multigenerational household 65+, everyone WA 50 64 suddenly lives grandkids even any. end game protectiveness variant strains still unknown. also know part population they're effective not. 5% ineffective seems like small amount, except still 5% large number. health experts telling people still mask social distance even fully vaccinated basically get herd immunity.  new projection enough vaccine doses every American adult end May. holds, we'll 100% re-opened beginning summer (first day summer 6/20). Holcomb wimp. won’t lead. He’ll wait follow rest Midwest Niiiice really nuance safety, go ahead justify wanting free babysitter. It’s thing federal government Texas unless I’m mistaken easily point experts U.K. taken opposite approach starting show pretty overwhelming data indicating right.  Japan highest. End story. earliest travel would maybe mid 2022 come by? 

Sounds like there’s many weddings crash. 🤔 see, thanks! knowledge, South African variant shown resistance least one vaccine, vaccines mostly work one well.

It highlight need deploly vaccines quickly. less spread, fewer chances mutations. US 60% vaccinated going sudden stop transmission rest world.

It would eliminate large reservoir, making identification mitigation variants easier. 

If already vaccine similar virus thing originated, there's chance could entire population vaccinated modified vaccine reached even hundredth current number deaths.

There literally possible justification anything attempting eliminate areas control quickly possible. 

All ridiculous justifications lot people whining mom dad making clean room. absurd and, frankly, embarrassing.  US \~209 million adults. 78 already received one dose 26 million received two doses. means \~131 million adults still need first dose. current rate (of 1.13 million per day first doses), would take 115 days give remaining adult population 1 dose, would bring us June 24th.

This would easier calculate/predict one dose vaccine, best could given information have. Keep mind assume 100% adults America get vaccine, assumes rate administration increase, factor Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.

If Johnson Johnson delivers commitment 20m doses March, means we'd \~111 million adults left vaccinate would take 98 days (June 6th). factor however many J&amp;J administer April. Sorry, need see studies organ damage kids I’m willing risk son’s health. Even minor cases documented result organ damage.

Hopefully J&amp;J vaccine gets approved kids ASAP.  True, even outdoor dining closed December surge, recently reopened month ago. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* They're mostly vaccinated. said I'm okay drunk driving, people can't it.

I agree rules vs. life benefit. Mine slightly different yours, that's may perfect following way better random politicians willing ignore science lose redneck vote. 

That's nice use bigoted term. UV light butt plug take cold, dead.... 


...hand. weird seeing things handled here. restrictions lifted indoor dining (which happening limited capacity one really following rules) even public libraries completely re-opening again. case numbers trending downward past 2-3 weeks we're vaccinating people 65+. far local authorities concerned pandemic populace happy go along them. feels like first time since pandemic started actually improved original estimate. Great sign helps improve optimism end sight. It’s time live life whether like not. Wrong, biased narrow look statistics show that. can’t even admit you’re wrong even faced large amount evidence ahahaha god you’re monkey 🐵 people like always lowest common denominator reasons reopening? bad faith. Maybe due better overall health? Way less obesity diabetes general diets better. also walk fuckton even countryside. everyone risk tolerance would restrictions. yes no. restrictions protect way, reason restrictions people like you. honestly likely closer 2023 normal travel occurs want completely honest :\\ results matter...promises See, that’s funny thing. think contracting disease makes sense, personally. lift weights four days week, cardio five days week. I’ve worked hard am, physically. labs fantastic too. Couldn’t healthier. 

When learned virus cause lung scarring even healthy people, response make sure don’t hurt health. Losing 20% lung capacity would devastating. bought weights home workouts quit gym. I’ve maintaining fitness home nearly year now. 

It genuinely surprises people willing risk life altering problems (not mention unknowingly bringing disease home family) could work year vaccines developed. I’ve never doubted would quick vaccine. 

As said, people think different things. friends maintaining fitness routines home too. 

We greatly looking forward getting back gym vaccinated. 

None us contracted virus, feel like life simply go on, harm foul. 🤷‍♀️  Get ready COVID cases then, idiot. Well, informative. Thank much. getting downvoted question lmao. even statement question. are, PA planning multiple, setting one right mall 5 minutes house, live Amish County Pennsylvania, near city. people vaccinate, less risk this. know, I’d rather everyone took vaccine. responsible people part limit probability morons screw everyone. feel like TX dragging feet getting people vaccinated. going make things much easier get CVS involved.  Yeah worked well around rest globe effective mean long term. know it’s effective short term, longer term data double doses (I’m specifically talking prime boost vaccines) old ""Kill let God sort out"" way dealing pandemic. Fauci under-promises constantly, almost fault. That's people get mad him, always cautious messaging. Fucking hate wearing day work. summer I’ll working outside. thing last summer mask heat sucked Don’t look tatis hit grand slam! Slam Diego coming dodger ass!!! staying head. 

Having mental illness still illness anxiety trigger host physical problems. believe including disruption time delay shots estimate. likely looking late June everyone chance fully vaccinated. 

But original July estimate include either still two month improvement. Lots talk plateau regarding numbers

There numbers showing growth. end.


This 100% false.

There minor plateau CASES last week major disruption winter storm.

That cleared.

Reported daily cases back falling.

Positivity rate hospitalizations never plateau kept falling. Yeah get mine June due 30. Wife healthcare worker, fully vaccinated weeks now. 

Oh, child home! I'm statistically vulnerable house, gotta bunker bit longer. Can't wait June. ..and compared COVID drunk driving.

I compared death levels, wearing masks. compared wearing masks. know masks COVID saves right preventing drunk driving. know flu, fact studies see masks work always dealing flu. reason masks seen important studies flu masks shown big decrease spread. seen COVID. comparing known (deaths prevented) not. Although would love see studies depth dives much widespread mask wearing would help flu need save certain number lives support mask mandate? 

Why different? fully willing admit cost aspect enforcing rules vs. life benefit. know benefit wearing mask right COVID really high well something like drunk driving. believe masks flu near level. Yet wrong perhaps look it. sure shit promote wearing masks sick. common many places. also need rules promote staying home work school flu season.

I know badly want make seem like hypocrite, not. advocating preventing death. impossible becomes cost prohibitive. Yet one cool telling people can't drink drive causes way fewer deaths would prevented COVID mask mandates. Sorry, hypocrite here. also level deaths consistent. Oh, CDC also side COVID flu. willing debate things end day experts reason listened followed. may perfect following way better random politicians willing ignore science lose redneck vote. Cheers hope things looking you! think may seeing light end tunnel least don’t live state directly between...oh god damnit. “Hi, customer trespassing store. send officer remove charge him?” I'm curious vaccine supply able keep vaccination capacity. mask mandates lockdowns made big difference wouldn’t even discussion places lifted restrictions earlier would significantly deaths numbers comparable places kept two competing factors here. one hand, every adult US \*wants\* COVID vaccine. fraction really want somewhere 55-80% range. could get point almost every adult wants vaccinated gotten first dose well enough supply every adult. hand, takes little go ""doses shipped"" ""doses arm,"" even supply there, could take weeks see injection numbers catch up. Longest undefended border world. bi-national military unit (NORAD) world, two largest trading partners world.

Don't make mention 9/11... [Ok, make mention American hostages Iran... [Ok, and? know national anthem. audio system bugged out. Guess happened fair, American hockey fans paid Go find bridge supposed living under. checked? explained stats recorded accuracy?

Do know warzone is? included Abbott's order stipulation local jurisdictions institute masks based specific hospital percentages. 

There contingencies order think help glide OK. So, sum logic: use vaccines murdered babies production, use ones murdered babies research.

That kind logic fit right people continue worship rapists pedophiles proclaiming rest world immoral. Padres looking real good year! huge solid win West Dodgers don’t  wait St. Patrick's Day spike Irish variant. I'm thinking herd immunity May even April could possible.

Then suck ass math. That’s really interesting. Thank you! US getting like 1m Jan 21 supply issues two vaccines 100m 100 days joke promise We're fine fine. !RemindMe 1 month. Governor Mississippi tweeted restictions lifted. death/serious illness rate kids flu common colds compare Covid? different.

It's logical keep freaking Covid kids, unless already letting kids play kids pre-pandemic due flu/cold risk. Hehehe look Lois, I'm elected governor Mississippi. mean...seems like 40-50% people US get vaccine, subreddit kicking good while. people still wear mask enforced private business. I’m saying Texas seems lax social distancing social gatherings. difference order make people partying houses go clubs. Funny, always say I’m realist. problem making definitive time frame part slogan. say ""two weeks to..."" people expect something happen two weeks, year counting life vanish without anything changing.  None beat Japan  conservative estimate. I'm thinking herd immunity May even April could possible.

Sorry doom gloom. work ski resort beginning season given double layered neck-gators similar fisherman use sun. They’re stretchy tight fit don’t restrict anything, don’t straps around ears hurt overtime bother glasses, genuinely COMFY. get everyone working outdoors cold weather tell ya they’re kinda nice. Sources say Covid seen crying locker room floor, unhappy loss. Doesnt matter, im still wearing mask still want people keep fuck away see light end tunnel I'm glad we've made point could certainly number terrible timelines, anyone else feel extreme melancholy people already lost senselessly virus? People die taken seriously beginning. mean don’t enjoy playing Schrödinger’s smile people? lesson Fauci: underpromise overdeliver. 
yeah I'm sure families people thst literally froze death dont care anymorr One small problem: 2 countries islands whose practical method entry plane, plus immigration/customs. one state similar, minus immigration/customs thing: Hawaii. Nearly every state driven state zero restrictions. state could lock hard want prevent people leaving open state. national level, US could've isolated way Taiwan &amp; NZ stopping flights &amp; like (tried do) land Can/Mex borders. emeritus financial researcher Albert Rädler exposed claim myth simple tape measure. Rädler joined library Amsterdam International Bureau Fiscal Documentation (IBFD), one comprehensive collections tax literature world. measured many total 2,000 meters shelf space accounted books magazines deal German tax law. result: 200 meters, i.e. ten percent. evaluation electronic inventory showed share almost 15 percent.  comparison shows similar result: According study World Bank consulting firm PwC, compared scope corporate tax laws different countries, provisions paragraphs Germany fit 1700 pages - United States, hand, needs 5100 pages, Japan even 7200. According another study, German companies need significantly less time competitors neighboring countries determine much taxes pay. Yeah, lot young people, risk getting cold much better risk losing muscle mass, losing cardiovascular endurance, losing general mental stability working provides.

I nagging injury since April, cannot run need cardio machines inside gym. studio apartment cannot much push-up inside. cold snowy outside, that's option right now. live anyone old/at-risk, I'm open around use gym. 

I put first months failing mental health due locked up. really need start planning massive vaccination clinics beginning start May. Use fairgrounds, dead mall parking lots, stadiums, whatever... need get shots arms ASAP. Translation: time sabotage Biden's success kill constituents. Yes right. Mixed phases scoliosis pain ~20 years. good osteopath session reduces pain weeks. Can't stop coming back anyway. idea things chronic pain sufferers ready stop hurting, hours. 
It's easy act like smart guy says work one dealing wirh constant pain years. Biden channel Bill Pullman epic speech dodging question though? want admit willing wear mask flu season even saves lives. think reason. agree way, I'd rather sacrifice lives deal annual mask mandates. Vaccine availability started december 14 US vaccination rates 8%, that's high utilization rates we're still working people really, really want one. could currently give every available vaccine seconds, people like would fly drive across country get one. 

Herd immunity require, ridiculously optimistic estimate, 60% population.

So assuming we're going dosing people basically 10x faster now, starting basically tomorrow. That's ridiculous. intended misleading, putting death rate perspective. bad compared almost countries world. Comparing states trying equivocate states done worse. 


And again, Florida still lot restrictions, statewide mandates. hospital mean hospital. hospitals local flu vaccine clinics huge parking lots easily process 6k day pretty lengthy periods times done years. mean local Alberston's processed 500 shots lunch two pharmacists jabs. need FEMA set line big open area. need FEMA enough personnel. NICE It’s rolling distribution. They’ll start allowing healthy non essential working people like lot guys starting late April US standpoint looks likely. World travel probably heavily restricted till least end year.  dont get it! 
i wear mask manual fucking labor... im fine. crazyy gator mask thing- cloth one filter it. 
ALL SUMMER OUTSIDE TEXAS HEAT... doable. 

theyre babies. cant believe come this. significant protection 2 weeks first dose Pfizer Moderna. probably fine. retail stores minimum wage employees, bouncers. think they’re gonna do? I'm talking context US. point comparing countries, ship sailed. compare California much stricter lock downs numbers similar. Let's start ambulance. That's grand mile. many miles hospital.

And also realize really set costs. Let's say CT scan. could $300 $5,000. Usually higher end though. also lot hidden fees well. Plus different rates depending insurance provider is, assuming all. Due scale payments insurance companies generally better negotiated rates individuals. Everything could billed recorded, sometimes mistakes extra items may skip well.

There variable amount answer lot. also surgery. taking space room etc. Probably need food water tok. That's money.

For context billing works, give birth touch newborn may skin skin fee. I'm joking. Dutch people want corona vaccine already receive least first shot beginning July. possible expected deliveries continue, said outgoing Minister Hugo de Jonge (Public Health) Tuesday television program Op1.**   currently available vaccines (Moderna, AstraZeneca Pfizer/BioNTech), two shots needed. vaccine pharmaceutical company Janssen, expected approved European Medicines Agency (EMA) next week, need one shot.  government previously reckoned would take least beginning autumn everyone wanted would least partially vaccinated. However, based recent experiences injection delivery various vaccines, De Jonge optimistic.  government considering 85 percent 14 million adult Dutch people vaccinated. Two-thirds could fully vaccinated beginning July; rest would one shot. According minister, administered 18 million shots.  Jonge emphasises everything ultimately depends deliveries various pharmaceutical companies. disappointing, could still take longer.  week, 322,380 people Netherlands received corona vaccine. brings total number shots administered 1,379,655.  slow start vaccination campaign Netherlands, rise within European Union. According European Centre Disease Prevention Control (ECDC), Netherlands fourth place. Finland, Denmark Malta better. Also known Donald trump Goal 100 million doses 100 days...

To

Goal 600 million doses 131 days...

That biggest promise time. interesting 7 years ago ebola significant thing, pretty much *the* significant outbreak (outside agricultural never really hit news) prior covid reddits time.

r/ebola never reached level corona obviously, significantly different disease, happen. need study test home. Put mask eyes stare light house. reduce amount light see? Guess reduce amount germs spread like reduces amount light see. 

There's lot's studies there's none better using common sense. Good luck man. rephrase, thats literal copy paste bro dad able get grandma vaccinated Wal-Mart local hospital system dropped ball multiple times. easy get appointment get second shot scheduled. Highly recommend using can. Mississippi without doubt worst state live it’s poorest state time implemented, adults offered vaccine. going take time agree vaccines included, given several Eastern European countries using planning use Chinese Russian vaccines. absolute terrible dummy. decision cost lives time. Horrible

question outsider: cant president enact country-wide mask mandate? real advice except closely follow federal state guidance. able push summer might give peace mind, worth it’s weight gold pandemic wedding planning. ""no one"" big statement. live dallas. (not subrub, dallas proper) id say mask compliance beginning became social norm policies least enforced...mask compliance like 98%

i go target see people wearing correctly. i'd go walmart see like 10x amount people id avoid it. 

liquor stores, grocery stores, laundromat.... going almost daily id see one two people wearing mask properly. 

now- clubs open. bars. restaurants etc. dont give fuck!

but whole state doesnt even pretend give shit. 

we went relying government cares votes save us.... businesses care profit save us

true American experience.

we really exceptional (/s) CDC estimates put fatality rate .6% hospitalization rate 5%

They 7% 2 vaccines another 7% least protection...presumably make majority vulnerable people...

Seems like Mississippi first time ever great state live allowing grown adults make choices health wellness...  Examples/Sources? Man sure hope so. I'm beyond ready done pandemic. keep checking see get vaccine far yet available age group. That’s precisely issue. It’s bottom half states. comparison Florida Mexico designed misleading Florida’s performance relative US states. add comment 35 US states also death rate per capita worse Mexico (including states strict lockdowns). I’m usually optimist. optimistic realist. Sure, though solved kids wearing masks going forward. Nothing says can’t wear mask live Texas. Thing is, many people already going around maskless wearing correctly.

I think people live think going sudden mad rush people, basically business usual months now. change whole lot, like said. anything, think maybe people states start protesting restrictions trying get restrictions lifted. Dude same:( moved Maine May live schooner never would’ve left dock I’m back Michigan. got taste traveling early 20s want try without external complications. guys fine even now. Incidence rate still high, positive test percentage high. Sure, maybe hospitals overflow can't fathom Abbott incompetent putting breaks realises mistake he's made.

Incidence rate seems already rebounding quite quickly past 10 days possible UK variant reaching critical mass. would absolutely screw guys ridiculously bad level. look happened UK Boris lifted lockdown early December. incidence rate quadrupled month still Texas currently.

I hope right. would otherwise waste US getting many doses vaccinations would wait maybe month avoid risks. Incidence rates would much manageable level least able avoid vast majority deaths. August me. take lot pressure off. I'd settle old-fashioned human intelligence. LOL know people also concerned, absence transmission data, say met bar vaccinated carrying Covid gave them, would give kids. think science wind side making degree caution unnecessary, here's hoping! see answer pretty soon. states like Arkansas loosening public restrictions (higher restaurant capacities) today Texas completely removed Mask mandate (a State 11% currently vaccinated). 

If decisions cause spike cases, we’ll known pretty quickly bad decision. May 8th us too! take pressure we're still micro still would amazing everyone vaccinated.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* getting mine weekend!! See 2022 maybe things ""back normal."" Sigh. likely, three week gap first second doses also need wait two weeks second dose fully take effect. everyone groups finish vaccination May 8, would need start April 3, seems bit optimistic elderly, pre-existing conditions, essential workers Facts guess 500k died didn’t properly nut up. experts recommend guess addition never leaving house, also watch news: Still taking experimental gene therapy shot Texan here, mask mandate lifted here. Learn us tell children love point, pretty much CYA thing that's causing things still canceled. NOBODY wants bad press events labeled super spreader event mean makes sense, city ride subway I'd probably try find m95.

But gotta understand rural fuck places there. county state still sitting 3 total cases. TOTAL!!!

You gotta understand something really effect really care. Sure one person could waltz light whole town, exactly metro station international hub. People need able make risk assessments based various scenarios. Obviously diabetic cancer still super careful risk group sure still see masks ""required"" (but really enforced well), especially place like CA. wait solid population vaccinated (like 60%+ whatever math says cause R drop 1).

But would stop possibility variants? two worried originated SA UK. US 60% vaccinated going sudden stop transmission rest world. fucking close endgame boys LMFAOOLMFAOOLMFAOOLMFAOO feel lucky ban face mask Texas Also means people die increased chance vaccine escape. really hope get clear messaging data summer people let kids go school fall! need people get them. 

There’s huge cross overlap people get vaccinated, people continue gather, refuse wear masks. (In USA.) uncertainty.  
Astrazeneca actually effective older people according separate data England Scotland Pfizer! Funny say Extra History 1917 Flu series speculated one many reasons teach 1917 flu often people's unwillingness discuss talk others. outside make immune getting virus. packed ton people around, virus absolutely spread.  never pass Spicy_Ejaculate.  No, I'm referring people website internet general constantly complain America 24/7 whenever like something.

A President discussing foreign relations entirely different. they're adding long term costs public healthcare costs, including especially costs went ER chronic conditions otherwise had, many got sick died 10 years earlier would otherwise. That's going cost state citizens fuck ton long term. hey, let's get guy short term points. bigger mainer thing, vaccinations? mean, reply literally nothing discussing, sure! I’ll bite.

It appears comment history you’re one seems believe sue government reopen. I’ll decline address directly rest society would able tell fucking stupid are, I’ll ask instead:

Has Illinois already eased restrictions? 

Did not, Chicago, announce higher capacity limits bars restaurants, well expanding service hours?

Have already announcements opening lakefront, city parks, outdoor activities?

What fail realize convention’s choice pull McCormick Place completely them. think still risk low attendance, organizers choose cancel reschedule event. Pritzker red phone desk tell King Conventions Chicago safe space summer.

Just shut fuck up, wear damn mask, get vaccinated it’s turn. I’d almost rather die covid hear idiots like another months, Jesus Christ. *nervously smiles* Even they're spiking, could falling fast could be. US going doses US adults end May, we'll hit effective herd immunity then. seem worth investment infrastructure (particularly since several things mentioned worthless theater) skip month half. Oct here! 'Unvaccinated Dick' - sound like title COVID-themed gay porno praying gets greenlit production soon stop typing comment. Thank taking time share big part article!! definitely going happen. Seasonal variations constantly cause issues way get ahead  sister showed updated vaccine timeline: oh, good!

Me: ready throw party mean counties cities can't require it? FL mandate plenty counties/cities require think case? I'm sure entire country reach herd immunity June. I'm expecting normal Memorial Day weekend definitely crazy July 4th celebration. know news earlier possible partnerships, would seem like win-win manufacturing giants. think sane responsible thing this:

If vaccinated, great! Keep acting though everyone is.

It may mean extra months sacrifice, also gives us best shot truly riding menace. Curious, Tuesday slow day typically? Probably newer variant Correct I'm dumb here, sort point vaccine? Still idea tour talking about. like trump said Canada taking advantage America? Oh, man, Lucky guy! Love Angel stadium! AL team it’s worth hour drive see play can’t wait see along Padres Nothing new. always kinda common sense expect ever since Johnson Johnson cleared  We’re taking week week. prepared implement safety precautions, feel, like said cautiously optimistic. Sending good vibes.🥂 Nursing home vacancies 🙁  Ugh. Never jump pool holding many people. 🤢 It’s like adding more. Guess Bard College New York rent beach, yet reason manga hitch gets way anyone reads this, PLEASE still practice safety measure even vaccinated.

this tabloid newspaper confirmed much vaccine stops transmission.

Please wait official announcement's results jumping conclusions. Hopefully means Canada June?! play dates son. Eat many restaurants. Enjoy coffee coffee shop reading book.

Probably inefficient. applied first two vaccines, J J individual dioceses opposed pope spoken clarify stance j j particular since development closely linked aborted tissue.

that said, anyone concerned, aborted fetuses used aborted generation ago frozen/cloned since like freshly ""killing"" babies get vaccine (so believe facebook posts say otherwise) perfectly understandable people want workout gym. people acting like gyms closed means cannot get proper exercise inherently false. 

On top gyms inefficient. way gyms make profit overselling membership well beyond capacity gym hoping large segment group never uses gym.

Supermarket checkout counters subjected many microbes. Raw meat packaged way often small leakages. Cleaning surfaces removes salmonella microbes. places higher foot traffic, going encounter people don’t wash hands using restroom. home office settings, frequent cleaning less important Basically work building maybe 20 people max, pretty large building we're spread out. I'm usually lab one guy 70s, wear masks time stay far away can. People work home usually opt to, especially sales side.

As do, manufacturing team gives something built print test plan make sure functioning properly. there's test plan, write one based schematics provided documents.

Yup! using logo usually easier determine who. one best, see truly evil things. example, friend called police neighbors friends Independence Day party, invited friends “small Christmas gathering” later year. I’m sure leaders preaching take secret though We've year meaninglessness, lonely stress. Everyone's mental health bad right articles suggesting there's light future trying extinguish hope going make worse.

Bonus points: even though population within city limits much greater surrounding area, half admitted hospital came rural areas without mask mandates. Restrictions masks work. Period.

 Well vaccines vial like someone mentioned, whereas part flu shots usually pre-filled syringe saves time draw dose up. They’re administered route muscle. normally peak flu-shot season 30ish day, whereas stores covid shots per day that. Around December amount people getting flu shots starts Peter giving us break, due timing it’s like cranking engine back again. also time year corporate starts cutting hours due normally slowing things prior summer. would hope someone would talk sense nuts. I’ve opposite experience you, grandparents Florida gotten shots, stepmom getting first yesterday dad going get today. grandparents mom Georgia also got shots, step grandparents Jersey gotten shots. person family 65 couldn’t get covid recently told wait. I’m 19, since I’m asthmatic I’m hoping able get soon. home Florida I’d able get right I’m Indiana isn’t high risk yet Target let's make appointment. seems interfere less. I'm also Novavax trial. one night running slight (but &lt;100° fever) sore muscles.

I'm really hoping means got live vaccine 🤞 Uh, no. could said wear cloth masks, T-shirt shortage. didn't. Overweight people:

- Die much higher rates Covid
- Spread Covid easily
- Benefit less vaccine

I know US wake-up call weight issues long time ago, Covid made really apparent bad is. Ohio little better regard, true, though still great. However, that's topic whether opening age groups vulnerable still trouble booking appointments. Nobody said entirety Europe, seriously trying suggest French president says vaccine affect public perception France? Cause that's seriously stupid stuff, right there. Oh okay Right - one fewer vector virus sounds good.  Reaffirming decision never visit chiropractor. physical therapist hook they're likely spout pseudo-scientific nonsense. You’re probably going luxury choice here. better nothing Agreed. miss seeing people’s faces though. know, I’m weird. friend mine hold phone... best quality send family professional photographers DVDs. Fauci lying again. says vaccines show prevent things, even you’re vaccinated, you’re going able society: example, indoor dining, theaters, places people congregate. That’s safety society. You, yourself, together another person, looking that, we’re going try find quickly recommendations could made people do. things that’s universal know: point time, unclear whether get vaccinated might protected clinical disease, primary endpoint vaccine studies, could conceivably infected, virus nasopharynx, time symptoms, reason recommend say still need wear mask. virus nasopharynx, even though hope data comes in, it’s going show virus level quite low you’re transmitting it, don’t know now. reason, want make sure people continue wear masks despite fact they’re vaccinated. rules post misinformation lead removal cases even ban. evidence research second dose anything all, booster shot effective around 6 month point antibody variation highest. 

The real reason (and bad one) changing biggest problem vaccination going anti-vaxxers. Oh god's sakes! getting ridiculous. lot unfounded claims dangers variants sake sensationalism clicks. variants bit contagious, therefore less deadly since that's viruses survive. nonsense dodging vaccines, undoing progress needs stop. every country people going way make sure one see light end tunnel. vaccine given risk available want it, need this. Nah dick heads various ages. makes sense too, red tape everyone’s hands tied. J&amp;J got approval one shot hopefully moot discussion end week. hope people don’t turn want Pfizer Moderna instead. time variants! Yeah think gonna go ""phone+tripod manned friend"" option. Professional services seem $850 minimum! HCOL area sucksssss million dollar question whether number drop low enough prevent another surge time B.1.1.7 becomes dominant late March. Well thanks, Macron making unscientific comment last month 🤦🏻‍♂️. anything say now?

All peer reviewed papers showed promising good results seniors. Yet, plant seed doubt population, based facts? That’s saying friend day.. like doses one size fits all?  good go July. I'd expect vaccines open general public May/June. Spring weddings cutting close imo-I friends declined invitations weddings next months vaccinated yet. Vatican literal said OK take Covid vaccines despite research involving fetal cells. think vaccines cut corners time around. Chinese vaccines using traditional vaccine methods think known, mRNA vaccines completely new. Top headline news front page major Japanese media:

NHK -- Asahi Shimbun --  Yomiuri Shimbun -- real problem without vaccines countries chances virus mutating jumping vaccines protections grows day. like we're isolated, amount traveling species happen fast. difference pretty noticeable 30%. Think way: 5 people get sick normally would infected 10 others, infect \~7 others 30% vaccination. feel way fucking ridiculous. offense people work medical field, I've heard ton stories like spewing bullshit takes theories throughout whole pandemic, feeling justified takes got degree even. headlines one week like ""Twitter traffic nearly 40%"" flipping crazy. enough catch Covid trials (only 2 caught covid), head epidemiologist (sarcasm) President Macron concludes effective refuses give risk Covid. 

This sheer dumbfuckery. many died stupid decision?  see geopolitical angle too. China Russia actively trying leverage vaccines influence developing world. Seems less stressful later. Honestly don’t even give shit still wear mask not, wanna able walk somewhere without feeling like I’m walking Chernobyl downvoted Fauci said late February. sort wild people kinda imagined vaccines experts would say, went it.

For record I'm getting vaccinated see point allow return normal life. Seems like quite shitty time tomhet married tbh. would still postpone people happy party. Agreed. Right supply limiting us according projections, get much better soon. understanding science changes new information. Yes let’s everyone report everything disagree with. Sounds like solid plan me. literally sick. feel getting imagining scenario hopes pathetic existence justification. need asshole Jesus matter young people eligible, OP implied roommates not. selfish immoral lie status order get vaccine place vulnerable. enough people follow behavior people could actually die. Like said before, there's still tons demand amongst people need most. big assumption.

I’m fan single shots first lower-risk loved ones stay safe. people’s lower-risk loved ones stay safe.

Once broad coverage first shot, start second shots. It’s clear based speed escape variants like B.1.351 P.1 emerged achieving herd immunity COVID natural infection feasible. Conspiracy theory: subs mods started whole pandemic. ;) /s news definitely gets better better every day. Yesterday Novavax said expect approval vaccine UK April US May. There's also [Merck distinct company Merck US. think 50/50.

50% taking precautions necessary stop spread.

50% see need precautions precautions worked, believe precautions overreaction personally experience people sick, *precautions actually worked* really exception much catholic churches policy time. Certain vaccines use components grown fetal cell lines handful fetuses aborted decades ago. catholic church generally falls philosophy: given choice, pick vaccine use cell lines without choice, protecting disease death suffering causes priority. 

The OP seems referring paper published archdioceses New Orleans. vatican released statement December essentially summarizing previous stance vaccines, might remembering: Shocker!!! Overblown?! cant believe it!
Who would imagined COVID issues overblown? 
Please check sources misinformation avoid cancel culture. Good news!!!  mean people want new normal, people vehemently opposed new normal? Omg I'm glad canceled Hindsight might better roll one vaccination per person beginning, point doesn’t matter. Continue two shots per person officially eradicate virus. exact thing happen. Got banned 12 jokingly congratulating somebody eligible 5G fish people vaccine. think anyone ever expecting otherwise. guys get done May though, maybe help neighbours?

I think May start *enough* vaccine doses become available general population US -- US near end vaccinating everyone wants vaccinated. That's person saying...When higher self esteem likely make choices lead better health outcomes. Depression lead healthy choices. Shaming person weight instead encouraging control health appearances worse approach. lot research done people poverty low income neighborhoods access supermarkets produce healthy foods. short-sighted put individual like people said. multitude factors. Health holistic. That’s though. also families following science going forward it. pregnant women decided get vaccinated. Covid could left alone like chicken pox. Vaccinated kids spread recover quickly. Even 18 month old 100% safe even vaccinated. still spread it. goal end hospitalized dying. here. I've frustrated it, wear mask anymore, leaving complex. nobody within 3 feet me, refuse wear almost risk personally. risk live someone elderly comorbidity. Even then, people vaccinated soon. can't help feel skeptical...but also freaking relieved...like...I hardcore social distancing proper mask wearing I've probably left house handful times. 

I can't wait hang friends....go restaurant sit eat (I realized even done since last February!!!)...go shopping without nervous people starting shit front want wear mask. Take kids movie... Travel see family again...go fucking LIBRARY (all libraries nearby either closed completely call make appointment go browse). 

I'm ready everyone else...but I'm also skeptical feel like....is real??? really going happen??? like start ..I like ""this really going happen...this minor thing...it can't bad."" I'm like ""it can't possibly good???"" /r/freefolk bad want go bunch developing countries D: Ah see, wait year back normal, start discovering beaurocratic missteps coverups went last year! think that's majorities work  count wear mask till 2022.

The vaccine stop proxy vector.

I know get downvoted hell sub every time remind people fact, **you still wear mask vaccinated**. vaccine boosts cellular immune, prevent breathing viral particles sneezing coughing enough infect someone else. /r/apocolympics2016 still gets posts time time. sub never die Yeah also well-intentioned people trying lose weight scammed products/diets marketed ""healthy"" along CDCs statement yesterday terrifying.  Using 2 vacation days 4 days case need it. People live cities less transportation methods?

lol okay People go back crowds, virus willnl rise again. Simple stuff lol. demand peters I'd imagine they'll lift export restrictions.

You higher hopes need boosters forever. Yeah, bad headline. replace ""all time"" ""x month."" There's lot reason optimism, particular article ridiculous speculation. I've seen nobody else estimating anywhere close 55% 2/3 already speculated here. Scaling CDC's estimate January, we'd 30-35% range. also extremely unlikely additional 100 million people (over 3 million per day) get FIRST shot end March also give people second shots. We're giving 5 million shots per day. even close. know person wrote - editor approved - thinking beyond pollyannaish.  would say 9/11 changed US, Iraq, Afghanistan lot. Vietnam also searing impact US. much less global impact. would say without doubt dissolution Soviet Union freeing satellites probably important. think would agree Indian independence probably COVID Sgt. Pepper? Hmmm. That’s good observation. would say yes long run short run. also Tiananmen Square rise China far important. 

COVID psyche. years. question it’s impacted lives deaths millions people. keep mind still moron half US doesn’t even believe exists. lives haven’t changed much. I’m sure countries probably equivalent herd morons. 

But fade quickly current attention span. soon quirky memory share. even close impact. Road tripping end month Minnesota Florida weeks Disney beach. Outside masks, I’m pretty much back normal mode.


Sucks reading established western countries lockdowns still. LOUNGED LIKE HEROES Get real. silly  oooo!! “last fully reopen”

NY entered chat... Maybe T-cells kills infected cells? America fewer food deserts today 1990, fast food new invention. bottom quartile earners earn today, adjusted inflation, 1990, [according US public transport today 1990. 

Yet obesity rate time gone 12% 40%. number 12 year holds weighing 200 lbs 1000%. people obese choice. women get heavy hormonal reasons, thyroid, child birth, etc

For me, overweight lifestyle decisions. eat burgers, burritos, tacos, pizza drink anywhere 6-10 beers Saturday. decision want live. I'm 5'9 200 ish lbs. cut burgers, burritos etc cut beer I'd 175 lbs. I've done before. happy. like Saturday afternoon brewery crawls (pre-covid) like eating burritos size head. issue masks glasses fog annoying. also really long, large nose masks actually push it. physically painful wear mask long period time. anyway I'm asshole want get anyone else sick, can't wait wear one anymore.

I even tried silicone inserts make thw mask fit terribly. recognize limitations first study. That's posted corroborating study January goes robust analysis data.  Nope, goal. long covid called post viral fatigue syndrome, rare condition unfortunate individuals suffer infection many viruses including flu. Let say again, *rare* condition. justify shutting world causing much suffering. Congrats! Expect take day two recover second one. got mine couple weeks ago side effects brutal, cleared 36 hours. every country acted way, pandemic would never end, Country allow Company X export vaccines, Country B allow Company export syringes, Country C allow Company Z export lipids required vaccine manufacturing, etc. etc. etc.

The point likely made, situation nations involved would cut deal. give X, give us Y. 2.3%, rate tests come back positive California past week reached record low point pandemic. past two weeks, state’s positivity rate fallen 3.7%; January high, fallen 14%.

Yay!! dedicated people keep believing vaccine stop spread virus. 
Evidence slowly released. 
Soon sub indeed dead syndrome something you’re born control all. hardly compare T2 prevented. bad gyms hot zones virus. 

I went local gym December 2020, it’s gym I’ve going 4+ years now, walked in, saw manager wearing mask, walked straight Merck &amp; Co Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany working hard support vaccine manufacturing. Glad see broken family business find small bit common ground. Yeah 18-month old there's little data, I'm gonna err side extreme caution even wife get vaccinated got first shot yesterday, damn thing almost made pass arm sore hell thats small price pay get shit yeah shaming people works. /s  going make joke nobody talks titanic global news story, amazingly /r/titanic /r/titanicfacts /r/TitanicMemes /r/Titanic_Memes exist active traffic. might need suppository Merck American may know MSD outside US. Merck Germany different company. main thing yellow fever fatality rates estimated 8 30%, order magnitude covid Wooo wooo!

I want roll body L! ultimately come choice calorie dense cheap things readily available lol used weigh 396lbs got 185 started training mma/jiu jitsu six days week job changed spend lot time driving diet went home cooked low calorie whatever convenient even exercise went back 265 Yeah, I'll take it!

I think need get public health education campaigns going people understand J&amp;J vaccine 100% effective eliminating hospitalization death, including tested many virus variations prevalent. done one appointment much lower chance feeling ill shot. 

As healthy 40 year old who's already fairly low risk group sounds good me. I'd take three hesitation going J&amp;J. really wearing mask problem. problem mental energy spent constantly evaluating rules are, critical follow them, whether say anything others aren't, remembering mask, etc... exhausting look forward worry that. Please don’t Christmas reunion show. Alcohol causes inflammation. sayin... states others they're not. quite silly called essential/frontline what's depending live lol always feel guilty going Walgreens one. last fall immediate care clinic across street ran out. AstraZeneca vaccine works. Wow first time year feels like reason smile Careful don’t cut edginess. Yes, 100%. Misinformation, propaganda, flat stupid advice kills huge percentage them. Thank supporting point.


Also, fuck troll. Oh yes, 65+ WFH people full vaccinated telling everyone everywhere never leave home. surely made thing intended fuel unreasonable hatred towards massive group people. 

If knew would extended infections, could take additional precautions around them, known immunocompromised people, unknown ones too.  Time celebrate. would reply Catholic church severe uncorrected peadophile problem negating moral authority may believe particular brand fairy, b Get fucked.

I think saw many people saying part. like ""What wrong government that? keep voting people?"" shown efficacy 4 months? personally think I'd rather 50% fully vaccinated 100% half vaccinated. county California (pop. ~500,000) 14/100k average case rate 4.6% positive rate. 


Yet indoor dining, gyms, movie theaters etc... believe 1 public elementary school hybrid 3 private K-5. Everything else remote year. popular outdoor art/community festival May canceled second straight year. 


Where hope? county never left CA’s purple tier really isn’t track anytime soon. hopeful US whole local state area. exactly feel. need attend huge music festival (as badly want to). I'd like able go hang friends another state grab beer bar. miss playing live music friends much. Can’t wait again. weddings booked cover band already summer fall. Feeling optimistic won’t cancel. friend believes multiple countries using vaccine conduct global human experiment. Sometimes feel like live different world. 5 years everyone drops dead vaccine activates kills everyone people left anti vaxxers conspiracy theorists going rebuild society?

What concern medical professionals taking vaccine would interested talking them. Try researching sides using myopic scarecrow arguments generalize side

Try research facebook mayoclinic.

Of course outliers circumstances *someone* form issue result vaccination, point overall vaccinations safe nearly everyone, furthermore, vaccinations help protect can't get vaccinated herd immunity. emphasis though rare circumstance people fall category aware issue. spreading type info ""fear"" ""what-if"".

Stop perpetuating shit literally harming humanity setting us backwards progress. exact influence people era dark ages christian crusades 10th century.

Do understand that?

Pause second think statement.

You actively sowing discord questioning science. Science, mind you, tested billion times people far smarter me, far smarter you.

May try analogy?

Your car flat tire.

You walk mechanic shop car say ""Hey could really use help.""

The mechanic walks says ""well, fix pull big nail tire patch it""

You say: ""listen stupid mechanic... subscribe cylindrical earth theory understand shape wheel nothing nail, see shape wheel torus circle, therefore nail impeding ability hold air pressure. Kindly stop lying stop making question entire reality so-called nail stuck tire, that's reason tire flat. I'm leaving liberal establishment filled facists going elsewhere.""

Shut fuck internet, go get hobby, stop sowing distrust science. Doctors scientists spent entire life ... learning every scientist ever discovered learned, applying information improve humanity..

and shit stain idiot internet like shows undoes suddenly capability making facebook posts.

Here's another analogy:

A man began work beautiful sculpture. year 200CE. grand plans sculpture ballooned beyond scope entire life. worked death, wrote wanted do. sons daughters took chisels continued work left off. sculpture became complex beautiful, perfect. Alas, work much multiple generations people. man's family man's society continued work years, hundreds years, day 2021, still entire sect people trying achieve perfect sculpture chisels tools. intricate complex something cannot even comprehend, sect people improving tools, notes, methods hundreds years, thousands years. complete year? Probably not, work improved yet still.

In analogy, sculpture understanding medicine. 

We improving tools long written history existed. showing right tossing wet blanket science like walking grandiose sculpture that's worked hundreds thousands hours, saying ""this really dumb different way, going work.""

Who fuck make claim?

Do kind science knowledge trumps scientific advancements humanity? do, see it!! Please share sage knowledge us, oh bestowed one. countries' awful. Including Canada's. Yeah, that’s typed it. find frustrating people trivialise suffering lockdown put many through. missing concerts. destruction many local businesses, many job losses, severe toll mental health leading suicides, kids missed year education, much more.

What saying use covid stats make decisions, something wait virus say A-OK, lockdowns end choose end them. make sacrafices protect fellow humans, yes. learned, small group (proportionately) danger. CDC death rates age:

0-19: 0.003%

20-49: 0.02%

50-69: 0.5%

70+: 6.4%

(From September 2020, can't remember updated stats top head look scenario 5: best estimate IFR [this make clear danger unless elderly multiple pre existing health conditions. little ridiculous say majority people follow restrictions want stay alive. We're risk people, comes point cost sacrafices far outweigh benefits people unreasonable frustrated hearing others say 'oh variants, still follow restrictions summer'. gone far beyond inconvenient now. Pay attention local restrictions, people traveling domestically whole time issues.

When traveled June 2020, hardest thing dining. state visited started re-opening week went, restaurants hit miss around indoor dining even open visiting. Otherwise, issues trip.

Every hotel stayed 2020 felt safe, flying fine (outside feeling really worn wearing mask long one travel day).

It really comes risk analysis comfort levels point.  think favorite trope argument people point South Korea, claiming every country strong response island. all, know South Korea island, strong trade, tourism, travel industry bordering nation... *North Korea.* True sometimes it’s option. stop make geopolitical accept Chinese Russian vaccines. vaccine vaccine damnit. understand tested way FDA authorizing test data only. Anyone correct I'm wrong! fine even without distancing masks. That's Sweden cases young people getting ill. 13 year old let dominate life. Go play friends fun, pandemic couple months Mexican here. There's bit too. 

Although no-mask people they're actively antimask, like care. Oh ok, saw 20M recent reports could mistake unless something changed. mom gained weight thyroid issues saw doctor, got treated started losing weight. someone obese hasnt talked doctor work plan also choice obese. wear mask vaccinated sure though. reddit Correct. Scientists still unsure benefit convalescent [(A Little) Clarity Convalescent Plasma food availability becomes lot limited walking groceries 1+ miles option.

Bus. ""The City Chicago allowing bars restaurants expand indoor seating capacity. Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s office announced effective immediately, indoor capacity bars, restaurants businesses increase 50%.""

Looking better better day us Chicago! That's like see :) People believe fairies sign this. Next : fairy one true fairy therefore must kill believing (slightly different) fairy. 


Humans believe three attempting kids trials, understand J&amp;J furthest behind three?

www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/health/covid-vaccines-children.html

That's 12+. 3 probably test younger kids too, probably 12+ trials. AZ safe. multiple trials gauge safety, also like 20% British people jabbed would know likely cause anything truly horrible.

I've heard rumors AZ average worse side effects Pfizer, personally got first dose Pfizer felt like shit two days I'm sure much buy that, suspect similar side effects. 

Studies show full two dose AZ vaccine effective preventing symptomatic COVID, almost completely protective hospitalization death, great vaccine. full two dose Pfizer Moderna vaccines *even more* protective AZ symptomatic COVID also probably provide better protection AZ South Africa variant (I'm guessing AZ produce booster target SA variant), guess choice getting either things equal might well get Pfizer Moderna, unvaccinated choice getting AZ wait couple months different vaccine become available, would get AZ without hesitation. great, safe, extremely effective vaccine! Catholic Church microcosm what's going society today - largely divided. 

Remember, every diocese seems say nah vaccine, many others encourage vaccine usage. area recently went several outdoor restaurants waitresses sensibly using face shield mask. never say month ago. Pretty sure UK lifts restrictions June little early tell. best answer going get window months. There's way confidently specific that.

So, Memorial Day earliest, would say July latest, barring unforeseen tragedy. confirm, hurry got hot dog everyone else.  long dose occur? J&amp;J also good fence feel uncomfortable Pfizer Moderna mRNA vaccines. probably comparable modern pandemic?

I hate comparison much, little social distancing going everything else happening time. prefer comparison AIDS, TB, Polio, 1957/1968 pandemics, anything Spanish Flu.  doable tho?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* truly great human idea talking comes stuff. get wants protect daughters going LITTLE far avoid lockdowns? didn't. listened. get email. state ignored CDC thing. I'll eligible 5 years. (Obviously kidding, kind not) Oh man no2 laid 2 solid days. Fever, sweats, chills, aches pains- live Virginia anyone specific guesses us. People US completely distorted perception normal/healthy weight is.

The really sad thing lot people think countries skinny. Louisiana residents: oh, we're news! Wait, oh no, we're news. know, never let facts get way joke. parent's doctor said 50s eligible vaccines 4 weeks.

Looks like we'll getting summer :3 air producing humid air outside mask. 

The air inside lungs always humid bothered don’t care “experts” say. 

And it. guidelines classify ""essential"" eligible vaccine offered it, ""taking"" vaccine people. Idk getting super downvoted. Im anti doom come going back normal IMMEDIATELY would terrible idea -- need give months really let vaccines crush this. said, herd immunity necessarily going reached year need normality, really need crush hospitalization numbers get supply &lt; demand vaccines Actually, recommend 1.5"" needle instead 1"" people certain weights. since drawn people go line, I've seen use 1"" matter big people are. 

Since muscle shots, need deep enough effective. 

Wonder many 'ineffective' results may administering using incorrect length needle.

Big folks, make sure ask needle 1.5""! Summer Memorial Day weekend Summer celestial summer late June? I'm moreso pointing reluctant explain reduce spread. Atleast experience Good. smart people. UK evidence indicates AZ vaccine best preventing hospitalizations. dramatic decrease cases deaths UK astonishing, particularly elderly groups. Macron indicted causing death baseless fear mongering PR campaign undertaken EU governments order promote AZ vaccine. Correct. started ""2 weeks stop spread"". US? starting right now. libertarian states pretty much back normal already. expect see restrictions loosened across country starting later month April. 0/0 zero, indeterminate tolerance side effects going lower kids, given covid significant danger nearly children. clear-cut risk/benefit analysis adults (esp. older adults). sub, lot people like that.

The pandemic absolute godsend people chip shoulder regarding physical strength fitness. 14 days flatten curve ^tm US, general consensus seems largely “normal” summer. Depends live. city I’m moving dropped mask mandates last week dinning restrictions. Yep. males, 26.5 females. priests actually molesting, really. number general populace.

As covering (which *is* done inordinate rate, especially given centralized nature institution), would mostly bishops archbishops, priests much. Signed rite aid vaccination PA. got text message confirmation email. supposed get email? Text said bring ID insurance card “tripping” look like? Cases going again? easily happen (and probably will) come November flu season restarts holiday travel happens. agree wait bit til greater percentage risk populations vaccinated, people seem waiting vague moment feel safe opposed basing vaccination rates Mid-30s France agree 100%. tell show up... chose two mentioned reason ;)

We still haven’t figured wtf protons do. Positron emission *supposed be* thing damnit... maybe. Also magnets: work?

But seriously things mentioned observations, predictions. suppose I, comically enough, specific statement [Walmart.com: Pharmacies offering COVID-19 shouldn’t much ask someone, otherwise options rest us have? 

To wear masks forever accommodate antivaxers? 
Saying children 20, even 16 dying covid false, children died. 

Saying children unaffected also false. Children getting MIS-C, CDC states still learning idea kids get don't. children hopefully recover, die (even without MIS-C), even know full long-term effects children except may need long term coronary care. like ppl outright ignore data science push unsubstantiated fear mongering.

Blanket statements children unaffected die like people outright ignore data science sound informed really ignore data points fit beliefs. 

My example lung damage that, example. Much like covid adults know true long-term effects we're exactly long term timeline.

So understand asking right now? know long term issues children. lung related? Probably not, potentially serious resulting long term issues death? Yes. blows mind Canada domestic production. Government aware this, summer 2020 begin building facility whenever time vaccine came, they'd less close already ready produce get shots quicker?

Idk man I'm frustrated government handling vaccinations. again, Hamilton Ford would probably send us vaccines last. cases steadily going ""Two weeks stop spread"".

We've told much crap last year, would anyone take ""hold xxx longer!"" seriously? I'm actually going miss masks. 

Plus, huge strike surveillance society.

We told years face coverings yada yada bad yada yada keeping boot people's throats bulk facial recognition work.

I hope keep wearing masks in. want able hug people again. Well exporting. Ask britain, UAE, Israel. ""Vaccinated people spread too.""

I think initial concern. evidence seems leading vaccine cases stop spread virus. We'll know sure coming months.

And yes, probably correct covid always us. science amazing! year two flu shot likely contain booster covid shots address variants. Florida really ""emperor clothes"" moment relates effectiveness lockdowns. Florida kept tracking rest US consistently per capita cases deaths winter slowly started realize restrictions nearly much think do. Florida today clearly better would strict system. need dose optimism/motivation today. current projections life slowly start become normal (USA)? Good news, mature enough recognize mean threat anywhere close over, altho every fiber wishes case. Interstate international travel still open, all. would change anything?

Right focus needs getting good grades, making friends talking girls, Coronavirus. Looks like ""4th wave"" going already, quick 4th wave. Reopen April. many things wrong this. One thing: hypothetically segregate vaccinated non-vaccinated people, diminish mostly eliminate herd immunity? ...facts? Facts decide. know, objective truths. 

Most vaccines require two doses: true

It still possible transmit virus even get vaccine: true

COVID still kill cause significant side-effects young people: true, lower risk

COVID hoax: false

Wearing mask slow transmission: false

It's impossible contract virus outside: false, true significantly lower risk already enacted year 500,000 deaths think won’t. Probably while. first weeks it’d one hell spectacle. think people acceptable level risk - we've gone entire lives potentially exposed diseases like flu transmitted via respiratory droplets, cause death amongst vulnerable populations. im saying covid like flu, think people want return normal risk covid, reach feel acceptable level risk. dont shut things implement social distancing masking orders every flu season, still risk catching potentially dangerous virus spreads via respiratory droplets kill vulnerable populations.

during winters 2018 2019 probably terrified getting flu spreading family, probably wearing mask sanitizing packages, vaccines widely rolled out, sizeable percentage folks vaccinated, case numbers/deaths/hospitalizations fall numbers comparable seasonal flu, remain terrified? many risks take every day result death. get handle thing via vaccines think many people willing return normal level risk ok wont feel need wait risk covid. I'm worried happens when/if current vaccines become noticeably ineffective. Like learn lesson line new improved, go back 12-15 months hell again. Vaccines COVID-19 start used Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) FDA. EUA makes vaccine available public health emergencies. **It means vaccine available outside research study yet approved**. usual first step new vaccine. vaccine continue used long people benefit it. research continues moves toward full approval.



means lot coming Even without COVID, think people still wear masks cough something. lived Japan 4 years first thought weird people wear masks, think necessary keep people healthy much possible. Headline slightly misleading. said avoided *if* option available. Given current state supply, means statement pretty much inapplicable. male, 20-23% body fat considered borderline obese, probably would. female, numbers obesity bit different, probably best say much data.

On general point:

Overweight people studies nearly always fat people rather muscular ones. Despite fact discussion obesity inevitably results people saying ""what people heavy work muscle?"", reality people tiny proportion population. Statistically speaking, virtually everyone who's significantly overweight fat. seems super excessive, role requires wear gloves something? not, way better washing hands frequently want virus mutate even completely vaccine evasive.

Just checking: realize US less 5% world's population, mutations happened continue happen elsewhere, regardless domestic policies?  Playing ear :) kinda planning 90-180 day lag behind country (USA). Hope I'm wrong! laughing still am. Everyone going get them

Except anti-vaxxers people virus kills even chance get vaccine. right on, universal problem bombarded corps bad actor governments undermining fabric society. 

We live era people seeking plastic surgery look like instagram pictures, top priority life planet even slowly dying quickly dying. 

Sneakers produced corps specifically collectors pay never use artists make unique art get hit choosing beggars work day making something exchange nothing... many signs end solution sight.

Probably can't find alien intelligence universe. ""Intelligence"" dead end. Dinosaurs got along fine hundreds millions years pea brains, us big brain primates come scene blow planet 0.001% time.  governor Texas making “announcement” today. think mask mandate lifted. They've vaccinated 55.1 percent population, 95. 95 percent figure people 50, cases absolutely cratered almost nonexistence.

55.1 leaves large pool people get infected. Everything going expected. vaccine acceptance higher UK Spain states. pretty dense.

Never change. hope Washington State moves 1B Tier 2 soon, fucking month 1B Tier 1.

Or, even better, hope away tier system let anyone wants vaccine get one. means open vaccines everyone sooner. happens headed back normal. Yeah struggled putting clothes/jackets couple days especially first two. couldn’t hurt like mofo 50% population gotten 1 dose, 20% gotten 2 doses, 50+20+20 = 90 - i.e. administrated 90 doses every 100 citizens, 30% citizens gotten anything yet.

Israel signed special agreement Pfizer, pay extra, also turning health data. 9 million people robust healthcare information system.

Their cases falling, super quickly, actually surge serious infections young unvaccinated, cancelled dramatic fall cases among vaccinated elderly. Looking hospitalizations, new hospitalizations among 60 age group outnumber 60+ age group first time. Graph: also reported people seem gotten careless soon vaccination lead cases. "" “Surprisingly, daily incidence cases increased strongly vaccination till day eight – approximately doubling. don’t know initial surge infection risk may related people less cautious maintaining protective behaviours soon injection,” said Hunter."""" That’s good! And, probably provides even reassurance both! word 'wave' broad. end peaking say 100-150k cases again, hospitalizations/deaths stay decreasing due vaccines, eventually cases go due vaccine eligibility increasing everyone 16+, honestly matter much there's another wave? 

Some people keep painting viewpoint naive optimism never denied potential wave spring. There's point in.bejng worried though jt likely catastrophic, almost expert voices suggesting catastrophic wave US least view history basically americans go work. fine, certainly part history, world historic scale fall ussr way important. entire 20th century sort building final reckoning dialectical views nature social organisation. aesthetic changes 2020 insignificant scale. Heh January 2020 saw news lockdowns china extreme looked teenager said going change world. tells time thought nuts told that. 

 idea crazy would get knew going extreme like anything seen lifetime going get ugly.

Still never even imagined last year nuts was. state removed pretty much everyone essential worker group (1C), alone there..... sad is. People traveled long time also. think want mad yea lot people are. source says 55.1 percent population least one dose. misread. Hmmmmm

New York didn’t send sick people back nursing homes 

No doubt. agree on. change fact hospitals overrun though. that's even reason get vaccinated, people wearing masks anymore going reckless... America=CORNBALL NATION I’m France one know heard this. hasn’t mainstream controversy French media. I’ve heard twice, twice reddit.

But time, people get pissy “moving goalposts” anything takes longer expected. things genuinely aren’t going back normal 2022. lying people isn’t going help anyone. major approved vaccines effective it. good. swear TX breeds stupid variant prevents safely taking post-vaccination trip Vegas fall I'm going move Texas run office.

We’ve already seen easing Colorado gym capacity restrictions. I’ve expected spring summer things ease even more. figure wearing masks least summer. that’s easy ask, still don’t understand anybody fights that. fully vaccinated end month, I’ll wearing disposable mask (as opposed current N95s), dining going movies. Yay! it’s widely available, isn’t risk point? Don’t get wrong don’t like needless death put mildly, what’s case going back normal everyone opportunity vaccinated? could ... know ... push elected officials follow science instead stupidity. another surge going thanks fools like Abbott. Follow science rather appearances. 

This literally every virus &amp; vaccine works. OTHERWISE VACCINES WOULDNT EFFECTIVE. bizarre theory largely invisible wave Asia hit rest world. mass Tokyo serology study showed 50% immune Tokyo October. 139 covid deaths city. study continued three months 50% measurable antibodies disappeared immunity remained.

This say started serology testing April invisible wave gone immunity remained, easing epidemics slowing spread enough lockdowns NPIs really effective Asia.

For rest world uninitiated, however... There's already statewide mandate masks things already pretty open here. Still it’s bottom half deaths per capita also older population nearly states it’s deaths per capita skew higher yet doesn’t. LOVE SEE IT!!! source?! need send friends super depressed doubting. haven't. reasoning shut long enough eventually enough people vaccinated.

Yes, shame Public Health UK's decision saved 1000's lives. dosing interval set trials scientific dictum never questioned.

How dare use collective scientific wisdom JVCI rescue country thick pandemic. 

The FDA lauded inflexibility. Masks mostly protect others, would avoid businesses masks required. still go retailers local businesses masks required, people maskless shop online I’m fully vaccinated. real. One silver lining last year talk anyone.

But fuck's sake, I'm sick ads banks big corporations saying ""these unprecedented times"" ""we're together"". think mistaking stock market economy. economy suffering right even though stock market well. Unemployment roof, GDP fallen, businesses closing, etc. anyone supported restrictions much selfish anyone know. selfish people cancer want preventative treatment? people mental health issues get actual help? much irreversible pain think caused measures? people supposed accept disease less 1% fatality rate? Quarantine risk, everyone else.

And people stacked hallways doesn’t change fact many covid hospitals specifically made deal problem, went unused tore months later. Maybe New York didn’t send sick people back nursing homes everyone Italy didn’t live grandparents would’ve done better. please resubmit actual title: Pfizer doubles number deliveries Netherlands: half million doses per week

Happy approve then. Please lmk repost. Bless rational responsible.

!RemindMe 1 month. 💋👅 side effects sore shoulder muscle. already mass 24 hour vaccination sites. wife's grandma got vaccine CitiField 3 am.

Anyway, weeks preparation unlimited doses vaccines available, could scale many times number we're now. think practice unlikely see much 5M one day we're going capped vaccine production lower crunch subsides. Okay, get better safe sorry. situation, time spend necessary protect worse negative consequences get everyone. can't cautious things stake. way we're acting regards covid think death rate 10%. need act evidence like this. ignore evidence bad things covid, can't ignore evidence puts fear perspective either. balance little much, precautions damaging.

Can't fix stupid. Well, except 27th ""Bottom quartile"" Check early morning (before 7am) able find availability. remaining half get month alone.

I’m sure great comfort families people die least vaccine appointment scheduled later month. !RemindMe 1 month Lol maybe I’m running Central Park. cross street see another soul. running mask.  Florida 27th, that's hardly bottom quartile. average.  mentioned above, Florida state wide mandates, cities counties do. Lock downs masking mandates effective though population sticks them.  We've mandates AZ months state full anti masking morons gather spread. we're 6th deaths per capita. Archive link: strikes overly cautious. Outdoor transmission almost 20x less someone running past within six feet second two - probably far less since jog, going weave past people try give wide berth.

Vaccine floodgates open late March- early April! Let’s F C K N gooo!!!!! Summer ain’t going good, spring now! Exactly dude. Lowkey understand news earlier manufacturing collaboration. 

Mans tell ramping **mach 8**. football game team ten 10 minutes go fourth quarter, stop playing defense? I'm South Korea probably appears we're much either, certainly Korea everyone worn masks throughout pandemic. friends Japan say way there. Plus, people east Asia bow distance apart rather shaking hands fist bumps whatever.  

When see footage USA, Canada, UK, EU, shocking many people wearing masks. obesity problems places exacerbate health problems COVID. anyone gets upset says I'm saying every single person countries, I'm not, please let post anger cause become passive-aggressive. know thin people wear masks. I'm saying UK, EU, USA, Canada disproportionately high number irresponsible people terms preventing spread COVID-19.  Anyone else sick headlines using word ""warns""? No, medical bankruptcy really thing first world countries.

In 2015 medical issue meant ambulance hospital. raft tests scans 8 hour operation next day remove significant part intestines.

Recovery week hospital six weeks home could go back work.

My hospital bill that? $120. combination amenities charges (having TV room) pharmacy costs discharged. Everything else covered.

Now think cost thing live - would be? Hopefully, people running jurisdictions sense governor. I'm supposedly ""good"" state requiring vaccine anything planning so, least far heard about. That's thinking. Basically anyone legitimate risk (old, preexisting, essential) vaccinated work home peeps basically leave house likely hood us bringing pretty low.

Plus whole thing outside. Says person who's constantly covering downplaying effects Sweden's horribly bad Covid-strategy. still matters _lot_. situation high transmission low fatality (like, example, ton super-spreader events small number sick people), setting highest possible chance vaccine-evading mutations selectively breeding it.

If actually reduce transmission rates drastically, we're much, much worse time near understand it. Fortunately, expectation _will_ reduce rates drastically. definitely matters. Ummm... think am, caveman?? Things honestly going well Biden Covid recovery, people's eyes. Republicans absolutely going sacrifice human lives order prolong recovery prevent Biden taking win. Every canadian starts anti-american comment ""As Canadian,"" Especially elections. Although applies every foreigner. stupid analogy don’t know it’s upvoted. People continue vaccinated - nothing stopping.  play fire get burned, make fire safe play with? Crap, like work home Worst case scenarios *could* happen, know.

Especially world Bolsonaro president, actively sabotaging vaccination efforts breeding new covid strains. 

But hand, vaccinate pace like US doing, reasons optimistic. 5 row... what’s prize? he'd taken advice Texas reach herd immunity June likely.

lol RemindMe! 1 year Novavax expected approved UK April US May.

The news getting better better day. said masks slow spread disease wearing one harmless. understand support mask mandate flu season. would literally save lives. living reputation Mississippi likely worst state live besides Texas Florida. Lockdowns literally last resort. lol. didnt implement virus already spreading rapidly nothing else would contain it.

New York didnt issue stay home order untill March 20th. time gone 1 case 10,000 cases 2 weeks. new timeline Biden biggest news story right now?  This. Is. Huge.  wondering thing.

I think politicians liking J&amp;J vaccine although it’s effective, it’s “good enough” it’s 1 dose makes job distribution much much easier. trials botched. 

The November data showed efficacy 70% higher get flu vaccine way threshold deemed efficacious 50% . 

However, case smaller sample patients: instead giving two full doses accidentally given half full dose first injection recieved full dose second. way, found order gave efficacy 92+% 

Naturally, wanted confirm statistically sound repeated trials way much larger sample size. 

In meantime, UK went ahead approved vaccine assurance would worst 70% effective, best 92%. Critically, trial sufficiently representative number 65s. would later make EU apprehensive. 

Meanwhile, EU wanted demonstrate independence UK took far longer approval granted. Thus, AZ prioritised contracts UK EU. 

Then line supply shortage occurred cos AZ upgrading factory Belgian order fulfill orders long term. buy time orders taken left EU cold. likely good bit politics Brexit related political grandstanding complicated things. 

But point AZ botch trial bend results. vaccine came Oxford University, one best institutions world. Researchers scientists staking academic integrity results. critically, vaccine sold cost , nothing gain rushing dodging results. Texan, let assure existing restrictions already basically ignored. today’s news won’t exactly change much. fried sweet potatoes better lot ;) Fry away!

refined processed wheat products containing HFCS going provide big rush energy morning, give something else try see think Don’t make doom gloom already there. What’s point? Especially something obviously wrong this. current projections correct 100% reopened late summer, definitely music festivals etc point Omg this. massive postpartum hemorrhage early 2019, months after, telltale phantom pain internal bleeding. horrifying. Rashes, apparently -

A recent study found 17% COVID-19 patients multiple symptoms, skin rashes first symptom appear, 21% patients rashes symptom. able identify effects COVID-19 skin may allow cases spotted earlier – even picked altogether people otherwise asymptomatic. could help limit transmission. 10th Texas

 
Kill friend lives another country, date matters regard different, haha. 


But still, yeah, get there’s difference available administered availability mentioned, I’m saying don’t think it’s far-fetched think administered won’t far behind. enough adults end May, isn’t likely people really want one probably able get since there’s portion adults fence might want one? see Israel data. infections deaths havent moved much /r/Coronavirus2 seems like saying lockdowns big factor, impossible compare state state given unknowns. said, I'll happy never wear mask work again.

I know unpopular sure ruffle feathers, please, look side-effects coronavirus precautions, particularly incidents flu worldwide.

I'm ready lockdowns businesses fully open I, one, plan taking important lesson ordeal -- health neighbor's health linked.

For rest life, flu season, plan wearing masks practicing _limited_ form social distancing. winter months, might take form choosing often get take-out rather eating electing host (and attend) fewer (and smaller) social gatherings.

It's going dominate life, take steps limit exposure transmission respiratory viruses going forward. I'm not. He's one ""controversial take"" wear mask day work. even issue. want continue them! sick year!!!! Wearing masks feeling well norm. Good day people love good news.

One thing I've noted times: like (and are) people thought never shut down, going many saying open up. actually played/will play US falls somewhere two extremes. situation pays hold moderate beliefs; chances higher get card wanted.

And no, I'm praising middle *political* spectrum. referring perceived threat covid here. I'd imagine risk mutations greater countries take much longer vaccinate population. Texas reach herd immunity June likely. W.H.O. everywhere. right, FDA approved change.  last something like 2 weeks normal freezer temperatures. A+ Biden Texas end mask mandate (and open 100%), I'm still planning wearing face masks foreseeable future, even get vaccinated. think info comes likely vaccinated person able spread covid change opinion. seems like early data shows vaccine help spread good thing.  Wait. weren’t supposed that? 😳 Texas, fully open states — vaccines available anyone wants one, example, you’re young person underlying conditions, able vaccinated now? people feeling restrictions going away, vaccine may yet available don’t yet qualify? don’t live Texas, pretty apparent going large difference cases one followed orders. I’m June 25th! It’s’s nice see fellow couples keeping cautious optimism! 🤞🏼

I unsubscribe r/weddingplanning stressing much. means they'll supply.  Administration probably still take mid summer, pretty big news, US neighbours helped greatly enough supply entire population.

I can't see later July early August vaccine campaign wraps up, likely near normal entire summer regardless. (I think western world, tbh) Got immune system buddy thanks anyway ever make back desk? mean, You’re telling me! live 20 minutes Angel’s stadium it’s privilege able see play ever want (well pre pandemic course) two small kids got first dose Pfizer yesterday. kids going weird issue us terms personal behavior — separate issue whether rest society remain closed every last child vaccinated (i.e. would ridiculous policy). things fully vaccinated adults, obviously every business activity open adults assuming crush case counts, kids always huge transmission risk they’re vaccinated.

That means even adult life goes back normal respects, kids going play outside keep distance kids, means sleepovers indoor birthday parties. It’s going problem allow unvaccinated children act tiny reservoirs virus another year so. really planned vaccinate kids last, fall. Agree disagree... least US. Same. really need see dentist putting off. ambition getting vaccine able get medical care I've putting off, haircut. ""But biggest problem soon weather warms people ANYTHING anymore.""

The summer incredibly good virus though people tend socialize outdoors rather indoors. Respiratory viruses often spread summer northern hemisphere. reason NYCs numbers continued drop drastically april-june even people returned back subways socialized more. Fully vaccinated people encouraged meet small groups homes. means 28 days second vaccine administration, iiuc. Also, unless local emergency orders exceptions vaccinated people (no exceptions ones area, example), may still illegal visit another person, even fully vaccinated. expect emergency orders change people vaccinated, though. Go texas!!! going wish die like comments here. got this! Same.... lean good news tick. force sometimes! Yes OSHAs absence borderline criminal. that's concern, children continue mask public. It'll still 60+ people preexisting conditions vaccinated. morally speaking, probably terrible even vaccination rates among younger crowd less uniform. Terry, Janice Peter?! medical experts recommend yes

especially active flu seasons, mask mandates public spaces mandatory flu shots sound like excellent ways save lives. i'll continue defer medical experts, you. I'll continue support politicians ignore medical experts,  Looks like we're stuck forever. Even wear mask, going shop hardly anyone's wearing masks puts much higher risk infection shopping around masked people. 

If want reopen businesses, fine, mask requirements easy effective way slow spread there's good reason end right now. net negative everybody. cant imagine going last way end summer. People timelines pretty mixed this. *already* seen 75% decline cases nationwide since mid january. current rate decline, less 10,000 cases day april, even counting accelerated decline result increase vaccinations. 

More importantly vulnerable groups largely vaccinated, vaccines effects beginning truly kick in. weeks, death rate vulnerable group (health conditions elderly) cut 3/4ths. 

I predict states going get rid mask mandates end month, almost definitely april.

“Variants!”

And many others lol understand concerns fat people, grandma? TX. Important detail actual legal document announcement local jurisdictions institute mandates based specific hospital capacity percentages. make sure don’t breath anybody room Wow true would Bay Area, even state red next week? 

The whole tier system good intentions it’s extremely flawed. numbers arbitrary metrics don’t necessarily matter much. Also it’s increasingly meaningless natural immunity grew vaccinated immunity skyrocketing. Also, states experimented us, staying open, aren’t applying data strategy? sub overrun lot type people think they’ll end pandemic quickly pretending everything fine. 

But yes, variants change equation (and already around could problem). infectious and/or antibody resistant variant infect people previously prevalent variants, it’s entirely possible see surge level restrictions now. It’s guaranteed huge problem (we’re trying vaccinate fast can), aren’t looking simple straightforward drop zero cases next months. put another couple months could really end thing

A lot book-keeping issues. example pull kid public school enroll legitimate home-schooling program offered state, sometimes tracked correctly times there's delay/problem resulting students ""missing"" end school year (and even sometimes requires manual record consolidation, homeschooling programs include state's unique identifier student).   

Aside data issues, real, parents also common drop ball terms paperwork (e.g. failure notify state they're kid out-of-state home school program). typically resolves parent gets nasty-gram letter state, things backed due sheer numbers involved.   

I guess point is: likely *real* problem (i.e. kids getting education), idea many/the scale, even normal times keeping track kids mess tons parents pulling kids time amplified problem. No. wear many masks douse much disinfectant like. thought states release availability citizens? reason ask wouldn’t supply demand differ state would also cause estimated time vaccinate groups vary? moral code contributing culture divisiveness shaming society pervasive going long pandemic. one year allowed different set values without called “callous” “grandma killer” - more. virtue empathy results normalizing abnormal mentally ill behavior (like demanding masks beach).

Grew one. Public transportation basically non-existent. comment chain existence food deserts within cities health concerns pose society. public health standpoint, serious barriers low income/marginalized groups face negatively affect well-being. Traveling mile city serious barrier groups. Again, I'm saying cities less transportation options, marginalized groups luxury using options multiple standpoints cost, time investment, infrastructure. 

This say rural communities issues availability accessibility healthy food. much do. term (food desert) research goes addressing issue. Food deserts complex issue, area different challenges experience. informed problem, create initiates invest resources fixing said issue. imagine dude cowboy hat sitting old mine shaft hopping horse end. He’s definitely wearing bandana mask I’d love see source says strains “vaccine resistant” Otherwise, ignore risk might higher, end panicked hypochondriac.

Except I'm saying either one things either. I'm saying ""Don't make assumptions."" (period. point blank. full stop.) Nothing more. 

If want protect something... ""more think should"". (that's safer default strategy). 

Doing ""less think should"".. smart strategy. 

If want ensure something bad happen (especially 1 possible outcomes death)... presumably want ""more expected"" (but hyperbolic degree ""being panicked hypochondriac"", nobody advocating). Based way things going West, think period February mid March looked back ""Variants Concern"" era, basically last breath virus North America Europe spring vaccines put away good. fiancé got first shot get second next week. 

We signed gym yesterday. vaccine comfortable occasionally going local restaurant directly support local business, remain 100% masked every opportunity.

The vaccine allow us slowly resume “normal” activity doesn’t mean go crazy yet. EU drug substance production happen Netherlands Janssen Vaccines. contractors Italy, Spain, South Africa, India United States fill finish. imported back EU (expect Italy Spain course). Great!  that’s bad enough low info patients get views EWTN. frustrating watch. wife isolated pretty well since we're risk, wife worried schools opening 100%. Especially since nobody enforcing mask mandate.

Most felt like huge pat back businesses fewer regulations. pretty annoying listen to. Yeah, wave numbering system confusing non-sense manufacturing 1b, 1b actually divided priority groups. everyplace vaccinating 1b, 1b.

It's like participation trophy joke. one group per wave number instead ""One, One half, One three quarters"" juvenile bullshit. mean, even Wave 2 managed get everyone Wave 1? I'm french, AFAIK, issue people AZ vaccine nothing Macron said (I heard it, watch News channels, read papers), everything effective Pfizer Moderna new variants currently spreading France.

I got AZ shot saturday, feel lucky offered it. 

Better hope. (*Un ""tiens"" vaut mieux que deux ""tu l'auras"" !*)

Also assume, line offered booster new type vaccine new variants. Colorado. Sorry hear it’s Nevada lmao Thanks reply. definite view thought really interesting question. Geopolitically, think either 9/11 fall USSR seen significant. Culturally (in sort 'artistic' sense culture) ... well put Sgt Pepper sort symbol social cultural changes Sixties: might well better (Larkin may preferred Please Please album!). 

But think (from admittedly Western perspective) pandemic will, along 9/11, event people distinguish 'before' 'after'. know commonplace talk prospect 'new normal' moving working culture working home (for large part, means) workforce standard pattern colossal implications society. I'm picking one thing there. International diplomacy based vaccines may well another.

So disagree view, guess, know - see things. Thanks addressing question! bought vaccines too. fill orders they’ve made amount. Well issue difference scientific community views journal paper vs public views news.

The scientific community aware accepted theory/paper/conclusion/ect. means concrete, it’s best available information time writing (that doesn’t mean it’s 100% true). 

The public view news (or least ever flavor news consume) fact news often takes jornal paper, study, ever, hammers nuance ambiguity write end truth. 

So journal paper becomes obsolete new study/finding, scientific community response “ahh new information lead robust understanding” public thinks someone along way lied, either new journal, old journal, journal publisher, scientific community news. fact never lie, misrepresentation public validity confidence original finding. Tell what, I’ll buy beer world unclenches fist disagree like gentlemen. Haha makes feel better, every vaccine administered cuts transmission. receive net societal benefit matter gets it. NJ state health commissioner announced yesterday confident NJ enough doses vaccinate every single adult fully end May. Obviously take time past fully administer given 60-80 percent want vaccine means likely open general public sometime April early May suspect.  news outlet puts words like ""may"" titles needs hire better editors. ""may"" stumble upon $700 cash money walk outside... though?

Not saying wrong (i truly hope right) shitty lazy journalism, type spread much fear opposite direction pandemic started. brother's best friend pretty healthy 35-year old died two months ago it. I'm ok sick avoid that. I'll plan much days it. guys states start vax appointments sit opposed snapped seconds? Florida bunch vaccine appointments Walmart Winn Dixie cvs sitting availability. I’m perplexed.   You’re really going best keep pandemic raging fall, aren’t you? genius going continue hurt businesses. Serious question overweight person spread Covid easily average weight person? Lol someone underweight spread less then? really matters treat would hope treated

One person told moral code. say change yours. well showed people columbus ohio clinic getting Day 32 first jab sounds earlier 2 weeks second jab? least get jab two 4-12 weeks first. antibodies give one jab count actually disease jab 1. ever used bus transport home groceries family four?

So first, ""food desert"", sounds like place food. Then, turns food, enough fresh food. Then, turns healthy food, drive 1.5 miles take bus Uber.

Now finally find term ""food desert"" means ""Area small percentage people car way accessing one need bring home large amount groceries bus like inconvenience dealing that"".

""Food desert"" propaganda term. would like referring people spraypaint grafitti ""building rapers"". someone using clearly wildly exaggerated expression, trying manipulate you. people ages dying covid. people shitty past medical histories. know talking about. yeah 100% agree. disagree 99% reddit politics understand someone might think X best policies etc etc. might strongly disagree think bad policy least see someone coming from. sadly say wrong even bother seeing someone else's POV. sad society come nowadays. Yah 100 percent capacity mask mandates extreme. Still way many new cases deaths. Carbs cheap t2 diabetes genetic. Blaming people ""lazy"" bad genetics/metabolisms good approach. Europeans centuries talk cultures. First other, aboriginals, Africans, Us. y’all good criticizing countries starting wars tbh. got actual argument airing grievances? eh, wouldn’t say ridiculous unless sick anyone else disappointed way Covid ended?

Someone tell writers Chekhov's hydroxychloroquine. heard vaccinated people still spread it. Everyone know gotten vaccine told keep masking/distancing possible next couple months so, public it'll hard enforce actually gotten shot lying evade restrictions UV rays kill virus, instant. Air flow also helps outdoors. say spread outdoors would false though. far less likely probably requires someone close comfort unlucky. answer question. Please re-read. 2 cavities. One cavity nothing it, cavity 20% stuff it. would assume cavity stuff packed.

Maybe see cavities different do. Grew poor immigrant parents. Maintained healthy lifestyle. What’s problem? live york region, good idea what's going on. get wrong, support basic measures like masks distancing, draw line take away families incomes, replace government benefits pay enough. also lot people want J&amp;J reason 1 vaccine versus 2 vaccines. first dose leftover dose. They're told throw away, even go phases schedule vaccinate somebody leftovers. (State Maryland) I'm sure cases. government needs vaccine economy return, pharmaceuticals need make profit.

Look Viox 60,000 deaths pulled market. believe corners cut emergency authorization approval vaccines faith government do.

There's definitely studies long term effects vaccines. Anti-science simply call anyone doesn’t agree you.  still go back forth “we’re almost there” “Jesus Christ never going end might see side” almost daily basis. swear people cope anxiety trying give others true. 25% French AZ stock used. People refusing offered doctors. kids get vaccinated whole family protected, really need worry antivaxxers? need keep stuff locked otherwise ever open. No, true. personally know number people 65 Group 1A gotten vaccine Pittsburgh private pharmacies. qualify go sign Rite Aid. restricting people 65. I'm asking last thing need anti-science people teaching NYC kids. shit? Isnt point vaccine? missing something? zero problem wearing mask. long permanent. Man, losing fucking mind. used optimistic days thought could quarantine another several months. end sight -- long society fuck -- antsy hell fun summer.

The flip side anxious fuck us fucking up: get vaccines promised, people take vaccines they're offered, COVID variants fuck us, Ted Cruz actually COVID variant personified, etc.

Do guys things tell get past thoughts? making tentative plans summer 2021? Yeah better “safe sorry” letting thousands people die weekly months could otherwise vaccinated. events would say significant? 9/11? Vietnam? Dissolution Soviet Union? Indian independence? Sgt Pepper? I've probably missed something obvious! People going skip line jerks grand scheme things playing rules excessive restrictions documentation would delay appropriate vaccinations prevent line jumpers sometimes chalk personal responsibility throw baby bath water Got first shot Pfizer morning. Took 2 seconds. general idea? Yeah get ""it's fake"" excuse, go-to every kind denier, flat-earthers, etc. look Florida, many wealthy people ""line jumping"" vax, sneaking low-income communities, faking age id, getting governor make ""pop up"" vax sites upscale communities, mean rich people want it, demonstration skeptics need. They're literally cutoff point states still following 1b groups, highest priority group still able get vaccine without underlying conditions gaming system.

- First Responders
- Teachers **&lt;- current cutoff country**
- Food Agriculture (I assume also includes meat packers)
- Manufacturing (which would definitely include meat packers prior category didn't)  Yeah probably right lol. exactly smart us protected profession doesn’t matter. need push envelope. was, downvoters. see sidebar created 7 years ago. :) feel Dunning-Kruger'ed myself, thinking could write tongue-in-cheek forgo ""/s"" thing. country that? First all, science process mindset. understanding science malleable, rigid.

Second all, know around decade masks work slow transmission respiratory viruses. proved SARS. CDC saying masks work misinformation *by admission* didn’t want people start hoarding.

It’s *technically* debatable good idea but, reality, Public Health 101 transparent, honest message it’s ultimately pretty clearly *terrible idea*. Like.. People must able see connection public health officials lying public public’s distrust public health officials. It’s straight line connecting two. Lol stop going go store insist wear mask shop there? Macron said it, complete desaster British media ran it, British people thought big deal, one else cared, end. Tag probably shouldn’t vaccine news whatever putting anyone significant risk taking mask quickly sips water. Well, teachers (55 less 55 years old) Madrid vaccinated (or going vaccinated) place I'm internships everyone went vaccine (or going go, today last day called go) 

The thing people sure vaccine chance get vaccinated (or thats believe) I'm sick word 'covid' split stated. issue country insane level selfishness, serious problem we’re lucky COVID wasnt deadly we’d really bad time. hear much survival rates, clearly folks experience chronic illness ( feel bad long haulers) class “well dont know anyone died” coming guy rural area regular acquaintance group maybe 20 people? Got mine. 

feelzgood.jpg thank :)  go Massachusetts, they're already lift it. Apparently covid done lol Yeah seems it’s popular thing say sub though lol. I’m sorry I’m young healthy basically prisoner house year seems like everyone else living caring one bit safety anyone else’s don’t feel guilty it. still wear masks wherever it’s required however long it’s required it’s time start slowly easing back living life again. it’s greater good ppl vaccinated. Obese ppl aren’t likely catch Covid though guess they’re often gasping breath might inhale virus bodies encounter them. healthy person likely contract virus obese person. It’s someone obese less likely survive much fat already compressing lungs. That’s say Covid death sentence obese. also plenty healthy ppl succumb.

If want larger population survive vaccinate ppl. Spending vaccine vaccinate fewer ppl makes sense Risk spread far minimal, yes! However, live major metropolitan area, I'm likely around larger groups people given time. I'll vaccinated summer -- first appointment next week -- still important carry perception wearing mask awhile unvaccinated. bad faith question someone divisive us versus agenda (anti-mitigation vs pro-mitigation)? argument made million times since mitigation changes started April seen WFH people arguing points like months. Thankfully I'm 13 days away 2nd Moderna shot. work folks refuse wear mask even though supposed enforced upper management yeah, I'm ready end this. evidence whatsoever immunity vaccine fades quickly crazy think US 1/5 deaths entire world first time life genuinely wish Florida haha

Probably havent here.

* Lackluster lockdown
* Reopened Snowbird money
* Vaccines prioritized rich people
* Untrustworthy COVID data
* Higher death rate per 100k California
* Antagonistic governor showboating future Presidential run toxic you. People learn berated beat reinforces views exactly doing. Merck two vaccines candidates fail. awesome nudging produce another company's. Defense Production Act used starting last year time. infrastructure known known regardless vaccine type.  waste click old article. lot confusion that. Ultimately not.  *[citation needed]* Stockton? Biden required ensure anti-trust violations happened. rather loose weight stay home guy, mean subreddit also consists lot people fine quarantining year plus think fine humans sit desk week drink soda, order takeout, eat cheetos day. also probably apply least couple vaccines, like moderna. pummel-worthy ones work home, fully vaccinated, 1)refuse go work still, 2)tell everyone stay home zoom call friend they’re feeling lonely like magically fix everything. offense, people understanding reality reason shouldn’t happen. world systems far complex seem aware. truth rarely black white.

If unironically think Twitter police truth it’s easy man.. don’t even know engage that. first emergency uses vaccines country's history. EUA law since 9/11/01. Emphasis emergency. normal trial, finished safety clinical disease prevention part, done transmission part now. God bless America, place else. husband fully vaccinated. works healthcare company. small amount vaccines leftover frontline workers refused took opportunity. Dude... post fucking picture pup!  say vaccine allow return normal life, said unclear data know moment. That's vaccine rollout happening 2-3 months, extensive study know either way. know, public health expert err side caution.

What's going happen people get vaccinated, continue cautious throw wind. We'll see latter group transmits virus significant rate, data someone publish findings. public health guidance change. That's mean ""following data."" We're data guinea pig. Vaccine production growing exponentially. Everyone going get them. people get sooner expect too. Ah, yes. It’s definitely true. That’s see many “/s” reddit. took long figure intention. sPoNge TeXt wOrKs get ton movies video games based decades come? 

Lets go play Call Duty: COVID-19 watching Wuhan. sign anal swab? I'm, uh, asking friend... idea someone would downvote this. I’d like understand what’s going body vaccine works understand live life next incoming months. individualistic lot countries would like. told young age personally responsible health safety, need tough, stand strong, get ahead. Mind business, take care own.

""When turn comes, want feel like fully armored knights battlefield, people cautiously tip toeing around. That’s expected us. That’s expected us entire lives. ""

Did read replying to? I’m making specific point/argument, wanted point Pfizer’s vaccine also made 3 plants Yet still don’t report vaccine misinformation category, suppose report them? Hate speech? aren’t even bothering try appreciate perspective, consider this: right wrong, American finds themself losing end something (job, housing, relationships, etc.) people believe person probably something along way deserve situation. Lost restaurant job? gone college. Went college, didn’t get good job? Well, major in? Computer science? Welllll... MIT crappy state school? Always competing, always fault failing. I’m saying it’s right. I’m saying it’s (often stupid) mentality part culture.

In culture makes compete like this, judges harshly even probably isn’t entirely fault, whose government isn’t quick support you, you’re going want sharpest sword available. context, that’s *two* doses Pfizer/Moderna. 

I’m trying tell mainly non-Americans American “mindset” think genuinely confused lack consideration one shot save people. 

Maybe thought Biden less... well, American. 🤷‍♀️ Chiropractors study practice medicine, listen medical advice them. MD give medical advice US. u get Amazonian cities Colombia, Peru, Brazil showing HUGE number reinfections. atudies shown almost 70% population igg covid last Summer, getting HUGE number infections worse initial outbreak. Less deaths outbreaks HUGE(30%+ positivity rate PCR going up). matter time deaths follow pattern. Cases rising, dip testing due ice storms storms, testing went back up. 7-day average case trend going 4 days.

Even CDC modeled UK strain would result plateau, another spike. We're 30-35% people already infected, 15% least partial vaccine protection, many people still working home, social distancing. There's going ""tough, tough spring."" chance. Thanks visiting make fantastic comment though. happens get ready mothers parties. You’d retool national rollout huge extent. England something like that, don’t geography population America... plus factor confusion change state game would cause. mean point, onus scientists prove mask mandates noticeably led decreased death counts? show models want saying X% wore masks, there'd Y% fewer deaths, real world data showing that?

Oklahoma, Florida, etc. required masks better states (in deaths per million).

Western European countries like France Spain 90+% mask adoption, 20-30% range Nordic countries yet Nordic countries significantly better results.

Do masks help worn properly? Absolutely. one going enforce proper mask wearing anyway, there's almost point mandate could actually hurt people constantly improperly using masks. vitro different vivo. comment boils fearmongering. talk rainforest getting revenge solidifies that. food desert section city easy access grocery store, generally defined grocery within mile (because many studies found people willing walk mile necessities. 

People cities perfectly capable taking bus. Poor people cars take bus.

This say ""food desert"" bullshit term. makes sound like area food, find means lots food, healthy food. plenty healthy food, take bus 1.5 miles. That's fair, read rest comments thread - literally everyone assuming virus stops greatly slows spread downvoted post Fauci saying 'we know'. Every priest participated molesting children covering it. I'd say percentage high. different style vaccination, second dose necessary There’s difference said trump said. true idea encourage people stay home sick. British press train wreck. actual Germany France pay price AstraZeneca scaremongering citizens REFUSE Oxford jab, causing delays shambolic vaccination drives  Second-highest Slovakia currently Yeah, ok, sure, edit comment include quote cut Fauci literally says things can't right spread high. Meanwhile peers look crazy say I’ll take vaccine. making things dude.

Cases NY Dec-Feb higher 'peak' April20.

There's lot interesting aspects - think need get political like seem be.

Population density, interdependence communities, even things like car access/travel impacts NY way OK. That's fine.

Most time, snapbacks cases happened big spike prior restrictions showing populace chose restrict without government requiring it.

Either way, Oklohama bottom 20% states one worst healthcare systems begin with.

They're also terrible education perspective too.

When take everything account OK somewhere people want live. Average job opportunities that's literally selling point. Source? UK source says 1.15% IFR high income countries altogether: Without context make seems like it’s saying something it’s not.

You trying say US doesn’t allow exports absolutely false. [You eat ice Cause time lives want come power trip  “COVID19 vaccine almost completely eradicate COVID19”

Wow, that’s fantastic!

“Britain...”

Oh...

Edit: US mess lower Monday already.

Sunday also lower previous sunday think you’re wildly overestimating risk Covid, wildly underestimating daily risk human. I’m 47, know them. Let’s hope it’s actually true. Anxiety really fucking lot people Netherlands. read article morning said 10 coulda misprint... 20 Million NC see 600K make six digits savings suddenly get sick get stuck insane bills can't afford insurance companies found loopholes refuse pay, sticking bill? happened someone close. Sometimes feels like person semblance sanity Catholic Church Pope. anti-science Trad Catholics really take stranglehold much church. countries need urgently switch first dose strategy, period doses increased becomes updated shot winter early next year. 

This happen inevitably, question much time waste countries finally get there. really understand someone justify latter.

People risk assessment, matter much people want try, really cannot force risk assessment onto others. Covid closest we'll probably ever get forcing places closed, never really control others around you. built country exact principle. one world calling 99% vaccination anything close it. Living pandemic sucks, brutal year, handwaving everything away strawman arguments sick pandemic life foolish. We're sick it. think covid going leave traces society long time. probably going least similar level 9/11, introduced air travel practices shown signs going away nearly 20 years. Maybe big things like fall USSR cultural impact like 9/11 definitely least Western countries. Also..when get little PTO never take vacation higher levels stress. Stressed people seek comfort food (or drink). think parts world likely good statistics. Incidentally, also parts world likely enormous case numbers high fatality rates. comment linking webmd.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  specific plan J&amp;J doses receiving. bringing homebound seniors going door door.

That's good plan. noticing Austin 44% age 80% vaccinated...I guess surprised, need high degree tech skills persistence register appointment. needs way help older people -- walk appointments, door door, call center, could allowed certain medical practices order doses specific patients, etc. even *need* 100 percent normal yet. Yes want it, would awesome course, wanna able go casual shopping beer friends, person game nights. Masks? Ok till everyone's vaccinated. huge conferences/concerts? Fine. need start majority social life zoom rather it. That's goal spring summer probably many others' well. Full normal wait absolutist social distancing. mask mandate may lifted private businesses still require masks sadly. see us carry around masks till end year unfortunately. There’s zero evidence it’s different story humans. statement little wishful thinking. Evidence ground strongly points variant worst one evolved far. Early vitro lab studies support this. zoonotic disease Amazon rainforest limitless potential wildlife reservoirs every jump humans animals results mutation human human transmission. Every species jump, like bat cat, greater degree. Cities around Amazon TONS wet markets countless species super stressed animals mixing huge ~~gunners~~ numbers people = recipe disaster.

The Amazon getting revenge humanity horrific clear cutting wanton destruction life. makes sense worst variant far comes place humanity continuing commit environmental atrocities every single day. Frankly, reap sow. One upside pandemic likely pushing technology prominence mass production least decade early. 

 
It seems like small thing, make efficacious flu vaccines quickly, much heralded cancer vaccines...look world. might Covid 2 tho I've finalized summer travel plans, think standing way work load point summer. could travel June, September, October 2020 (plus countless day trips), make summer 2021 work covid-wise. UK variant patient immunocompromised, right? know others? think immunocompromised puts pressure virus could work get people vaccinated? Either didn’t test America did, volunteers tended obese. didn’t really think interviews ppl volunteered. Obviously small section group don’t recall obese. would also say volunteered mid-to high socio-economic backgrounds. Basically time. also within certain age range meant countries won’t use vaccines tested elderly senior citizens. factors meant much fewer obese ppl volunteered compared representation within population. r/gatekeeping fiance got one worked mask decontamination site. I'm super jealous also don’t spread virus bad get effected badly either. get get better adults protected there’s much worry about. 12 around vaccinated parents teachers leaves pretty good place studies finish.

Once studies finish they’ll prove vaccinated well school. disagree. think wait 2 months Yeah I’ve noticed - don’t get point that. Love like them, still need masks drive cases. truth this, though many people also find foods like plain boiled potatoes (not necessarily baked definitely french fries) extremely sedating well, people various options. 

the main culprits refined grains sugar, refined oils (espicially via deep fried foods) easy overconsume due calorically dense are. 'cut out' shit, posted entire source draw conclusions. 'op'. think people tired feigning modern social conscientiousness, tolerating people claim supporting it, especially often completely illogical outright harmful like instance. still people way it, probably millions them, still people write angry letters television shows desecrate family values video games encourage violence children. collectively stopped taking seriously long, long time ago since they're tiny amount population, really feel we're getting point equal opposite end extreme.

After people get tired playing along. happens every time. attempts social control generally result pendulum rubber banding type effect complaining groups social dominance time, eventually majority population gets tired telling can't say becomes ""cool"" even morally upright go way irritate them. think people ever pick pattern keeps happening. Dude started lurking around 250,00 interesting watching uber conservative Catholics squirm somewhat progressive Pope. Read COVID-19 fan fiction! I'm also antsy summer. cold front literally blowing New York east coast right helped bring back earth. I'm okay staying inside little longer, seeing feels like 15 degrees outside. 

What's getting this: Even **IF** \- big big big get vaccines promised, enough people get it, etc. etc. - last summer, numbers low places. reason everything closed much knew little virus. see positivity rate consistently .9%? I'll feel infinitely comfortable going living life. vaccine! Three em!

For me, main thing tell (hopefully) never get situation again. miss work, remind waking 8am pretty damn awesome. I'm stuck inside Friday night (during winter), remind life moves fast sometimes nice relax watch movie I've never seen... try new hobby. miss friends, especially state, shoot em' text talk plans summer. 

I planning outright travel, yes... totally plan getting enjoying life summer. deserve it. understand sentiment I’m hoping mask wearing continue post pandemic people cold flu allergies. don’t want people sneezing either spreading colds end sick too. They’re expecting 20M end March thought.  nailed it. things already motion, pandemic sped up.

Are going back theaters plays movies sporting events bars restaurants cruises fun stuff? 

Absolutely. And...a small percentage change spend time money (your time money spent TN), shape parts world. 

Enjoy Tennessee, beautiful country, good food, lots within driving distance around region. mean, we're going pedantic, cases actually decreasing national level--they've stagnated last week. Hospitalizations continuing decrease, they're still high. deaths. 

I think anyone stay home another year, think would good idea hold another six weeks begin reopen earnest. virus contagious need HUGE portion population vaccinated herd immunity actually take hold, we're yet. Dad gets vax Wednesday! trains finally rolling! Can’t wait get mine folks I’m 31 going wait bit PA's 7 day average increased 4 days row, today started decrease again, 302 less hospitalizations compared 6 days ago. Amazing. Saw poll recently, sure accurate is, majority Germans supporting loosening pandemic related orders. seems public Pandemic mode life starting dwindle. 

I'm German, live East Coast US- cousin's Leipzig. Literally able ride bike like past 5 months lol.

True. formed alliance, instead tearing Germany two... Kansas North Carolina 5 phases. know every state slightly different. envious read English speaking subs discussing coronavirus. Brazil feeling optimistic. sounds cool think lot people would return dose #2 point. Let's stay course... ESPECIALLY single shot vaccine disposal Ah, pcr testing free, 24 hours normally max 48. wife, otherwise healthy nurse early 30s. spent yesterday ER 2nd vaccine dose aggravated long-COVID symptoms point coworkers (doctors pediatric practice) called 911. Nothing like pacing around outside hospital hours wife inside, alone, struggling breathe. 


But ""LIBERATE APPLEBEES!"" crowd, either 1% dead totally fine. COVID vaccine, especially Pfizer Moderna’s mRNA vaccines, pretty fickle transport, store, unfreeze, manage reasonable timeframe lots people. kept extremely cold gently thawing room temperature right person needs it, time management crucial especially larger operations. ask yes maybe answer 1000% maybe. Every scientist researcher engineer I’ve ever worked refuses deal absolutes. learned lesson declared physics late 1800s. made Jesuit pope, clear nothing good would come it!  /s Keep mind delivering 10 million doses US March North Carolina's share would 3% around 300,000 doses state. course. Agreed - interest, seriously - point part posted anything fact (ignore opinions personal attack). post statement presidential spokeperson reported Canadian press. 

I really see point carrying feud ths thread. Wow someone's really fun parties worry may still able carry enough virus spread non vaccinated people. differences negligible played media. Wales like 1% ahead England, like 1% ahead Scotland. Either way national level we're fantastically well. might actually cry happy tears get mine. (since wont summer) straight pub. they’re supposed suspended pandemic. saying shouldn’t be, you’re straight fabricating facts TRIPS agreement exist. companies BioNTech Pfizer delivering substantially vaccines expected short time, outgoing Health Minister Hugo de Jonge wrote Twitter Tuesday. Starting April, Netherlands receive half million vaccine doses every week pharma companies, whereas initially 200,000 doses per week expected month.**   ensures speed vaccination process,"" De Jonge writes, without going details.  Ministry Health Pfizer report conversation sped deliveries change promised quantity vaccines second quarter: remains 7.8 million. According spokespersons, become clear quickly vaccine doses expected; planning yet completely worked out.  weekend, figures European Centre Disease Prevention Control (ECDC) already showed that, compared EU countries, Netherlands setting pricks. holding back less supply, Netherlands stormed top four list EU countries administering first vaccine dose.  looking percentage adults fully vaccinated COVID-19, Netherlands still lot less EU member states. could change within three six weeks, however, persons first shot receive second shot according schedule.

You're looking wrong stat, they've given 90 doses per 100 population far, patient requires two doses, anywhere near 90% coverage.

They're also shorter 4 week spacing first second vaccines think.

So still lot people Israel vaccine yet, first dose within last weeks built immunity yet. guess worded better. meant like larger scale people wearing masks want jerks don't/ like last hour long plane car trip.

We made travel plans June, going get AirBnB another city weeks. Worst case, get change scenery. Best case, things wide open! something look forward to.

I want fucking hug grandfather. everyday feels like we’ll back normal sometime ~~summer~~ spring. Yeah, absolutely agree. Like said, people finding everything possible get tribal us versus makes much harder us function society people viewing many others extreme enemies. 

We understand people varying points view accept try best get along way compromise (and sometimes makes sense even try compromise, like compromise someone supporting genocide political based mass killings), agree disagree vote accordingly. We're nowhere near state right now. see plenty examples countries past present people killing groups based things seem petty us now, immune level tribalism leads destructive extremism. sure, that’s shown tweets. didn’t dig entire data dump. go vaccination site end day walk-in... almost always extra doses missed appointments day they’d love give authority all, Jackie Weaver! think generally misunderstood said. talking population level, overall results.

Again I'll point correlation =/= causation. logically makes sense urban areas could hit first experiencing decreases due already hit rural areas beginning hit. example, counties implemented mask mandate according CDC document parentheses ranking terms deaths per million Kansas counties:

Allen (91), Atchison (71), Bourbon (88), Crawford (32), Dickinson (38), Douglas (78), Franklin (50), Geary (74), Gove (1), Harvey (43), Jewell (64), Johnson (63), Mitchell (98), Montgomery (89), Morris (9), Pratt (21), Reno (34), Republic (17), Saline (41), Scott (6), Sedgwick (67), Shawnee (40), Stanton (66) Wyandotte (47).

Average ranking 51st deaths per million state 105 counties. again, overall, counties implemented mask mandates perform better long run. performed average, *slightly worse* counties implement mask mandate. Incoming category 5 ""devil already here"" Covid hurricane   feel like everyday it’s something different. Tomorrow someone say vaccines don’t stop transmission.

Biden anything announce it. Well continued news like this, be! 

Now whether uptick cases first parties summer (let's honest parties never truly go away), may determine much bear again. nearly bad last year, hopefully much better new cases blip instead month-long reigning spike. 

I'm still going beaches awhile. I'm already terrified sea animals, thought running around close shore without humans stomping around long scares rona year. People would still hoarded N95s etc. I've learned anything past year lot people DGAF general health. could said place british variant, spread variants depends infectious british really high, possibly higher brasilian SA variant, question say aquired imunity would work hard would enact, think?

Considering emergencies such. seems split even blue area country. 65% people seem quickly returning normal lives. 35% still stay-at-home mode go get groceries. imagine latter group slowly dwindle size next month two. able drive speed limit little different people able something evolved millions years do, socialize. Look sweet UK case &amp; death decline data coming there..  Clearly FDA pulled wrong rein delaying 2nd doses. can't say ""Oops"" though.. reflect badly probably late anyway. Well I'm concerned all. Many countries want visit already allowing tourists. want go everything closed (tourist attractions, bars, restaurants, etc). Would total waste trip went everything closed. ~~might direct attention to~~ government bad things unrelated people inject people experimental vaccine

Vaccines COVID-19 start used Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) FDA. EUA makes vaccine available public health emergencies. means vaccine available outside research study yet approved. usual first step new vaccine. vaccine continue used long people benefit it. research continues moves toward full approval. miss library Or, tell people *in thread* saying ease restrictions, otherwise it'll disaster

You can't ease restrictions exist, right? Every country verify asses whether find results sufficient rollout. 

EMA nothing national approval.

Also, South-Korea Japan limited AZ vaccine exactly reason many EU have. 2-3 months it'll almost summer considering low cases dropped last year, even without vaccines? Yeah, that's happening. China stops exports items benefits them. 
I talking vaccines specifically. 

Someone else commenting knew referring masks last year.  lifted last week, Ada county Idaho. Fact one knows 100% factors play role much factor plays role. There's literally hundreds factors consider plenty unknowns. 

Anyone says otherwise making shit up. Net York’s quarantine joke too. It’s self reported. went January. Know hard ready 100+million little bottles supplies put stuff in? long discussed last summer shortfalls get work together. mask acne worst!! bad summer sweating.. I’m dreading summer really hoping tell us don’t wear them. don’t think socializing now, majority adult vaccinated, yes. can't read French can't check, seems exceedingly unlikely President country makes rash comment vaccine goes unreported media country.

Sooooo got second dose pfizer vaccine. Glad finally exactly looking forward next days since reaction mild chills/headache/fever days first, second supposed worse. uh, yeah. particularly mind getting couple free days work though. feel pain.

Kudos you. lasted grand total 4 hours food service. lady yelled wouldn’t break food safety protocol cried. 

I agree. Even though know time it’s 100% fine eat food someone prepared without mask gloves, still feels safer they’re wearing mask breathing things. work retail enjoyed wearing mask work secretly cuss someone breath don’t worry getting spittle face yell me.

My skin stays dry year round regardless temperature humidity. It’s miserable. miss wearing thick goopy moisturizing masks night shifts though. don’t go well masks. They’ll probably let need see vaccine card condition visa like yellow fever. Many anti-vax people hypocrites secretly get vaccine.

They show rant anti-vax friends first line offered.

It's one things makes frustrating. always say, someone want vaccine, fine, get it. try keep others spread misinformation. decision, yours. want go Seattle watch Mike trout hit homerun T-Mobile park! want go Kansas City see Mike trout hit home run Kaufman stadium! much ask for?!!  half, 90% 50+

No. right. agree fully age - Florida 5th oldest state median age country much higher surrounding states, done worse Covid death numbers. would think elderly population would lead higher death rate. 

I can't speak differences, really seen statistics breaking down. Why? Spain regulations Germany France regard AZ vaccine. referring Spain rules administering AstraZeneca vaccine age limit– could even lowered 55 – means country need review current vaccination plan prioritize vulnerable groups essential OwO Could nobody telling it, appeal part society. Hell, can't make people drive speed limit actually enforce fines people caught driving speed limit hear people crying speeding fines intruding freedumb. also absolutely agree it’s time yet, fully expect late April vocal minority sub still think anyone leaves home bad person.

I’d love proven wrong but... don’t expect fully approved

If they're putting arms - approved.

No - ""whataboutism"" (you even know use correctly) - called ""precedent"" law.   Vietnam Thailand. I'm still gonna wear mask cause sick year that's awesome chemicals around us mess hormones lead weight gain well. overlooked.

Hopefully help way. sympathies. living, merely surviving. strongest prisons ones make ourselves. vaccine? seems good true Yes, prefer stringent lockdowns hundreds thousands deaths millions long covid cases. prefer eradication herd immunity, especially case novel pathogen causes systemic disease. China successfully controlled virus saved citizens death misery yeah, I'm gonna believe US/EU. 

You called bot bright you? SARS spread via feces, covid19 potential same. done animal studies. China set eradication, everything eliminate virus. can't afford miss even one case bc start chain again. Must difficult concept understand, what's approach country taking. CDC waited four months recommending masks, airborne respiratory illness less, yeah, brain dead people trust CDC's ""evidence"" based science. I'm Vietnam, third largest outbreak, think total number infections remained 400.


I could bit though, restrictions reinstated got control pretty quickly like previous times much less impact daily life seems countries resort letting things get hand, frankly people know glued news like people west. admit I'm one people, though I'm America still see daily news horror show there.

Vietnam borders China, Cambodia, Laos. major ports connecting many countries crowded region world sits middle diaspora+student communities around globe whose return gov handled well. Even real numbers ten times higher estimate, ten times higher likely number reported stopped checking numbers daily, Vietnam kicked ass start finish. nobody got welded inside apartment tracked invasive phone apps. came almost entirely people's willingness follow best practices. buy moment notion islands countries bordering hermit kingdoms managed pull off. 

Vietnam proactive plan place first SARS scare illuminated fact national healthcare system handle inundation pandemic would cause. turns rich countries really handle deluge either.

You island, relatively isolated, even rich (though fair you, never said that) done well this. needed plan, decisiveness policy making, population would listen reason. Yeah I'm pro vax got 2 doses whatever what's going here? isreal's case count dropped dramatically considering many people they've vaccinated? people still testing positive? counterexamples what's going there? - result sub overrun anti-lockdown, anti-science, 'fatigued' complainers.

Now, hindsight - closed beaches early pandemic powers wanting arbitrarily punish them. way trying mitigation strategies waste, never going end, done screw people, one number nonsensical claims made unwashed masses.

If previous generations taken approach WW II sub taking coronavirus lately, we'd speaking German. Yeah, sure agree wait that. Don’t downvote shouldn’t take variants consideration? Didn’t say cause surge again? Anyone want explain like I’m 5? government, companies. send Israel Egypt like 5 BN year fight other. We've already pledged 1bn Covax. different Spanish flu. global community back then. rare people fly side world back then. Now, commonplace.

There changes way people work, changes travel screening people crossing borders, changes education, changes world reacts infections possible pandemics. 5 years now, guarantee average country's budget handling pandemics dwarf 2019. defining moment localized single location.

This virus worse Spanish flu, world different back then. first modern pandemic used way world help spread cause damage. COVID19 virus released world hundred years ago instead Spanish flu, nearly impact.

The Spanish flu world someone travel New York Australia day would devastating. bet figured future pandemic spending planning. COVID19 virus actually bad. So, happens virus much worse gets unleashed modern world. bet people going worry want governments plan put money toward fighting possibility becoming reality. God hate dry skin makeup flakes get winter. Mask wearing aggravated acne thankfully get cover up! also work food feels sanitary general wear masks. anyone stop wearing mask you’re vaccinated?

This amazing news. true. joined Chicago group around 7,000 members much manageable. able book appointments based tips received there. last time checked 35,000 members seems like useful posts fewer farther between. Still worth look, agree might searching days. Hopefully release J&amp;J vaccine, we'll soon place scrambling find appointments (or maybe that's optimist me...) want see family, hug best friend. they’re state (or accurately, state) haven’t seen friends 1yr past Sunday. don’t think kids socializing think parents good place know child’s chances rough go Covid small without vaccinated. That’s really good thing. Hmmm I've told America first policies racist. mean, agree one get children old. don’t see connect party 250+ people.

Unless talking orgy. Tell owners lost businesses people work due various restrictions shutdowns Sure. That’s bad question ask, though, terms communicating scientific ideas public. “Maybe” vague universally applicable meaningless. That’s shit like “climate change theory” comes from. “Yes no, degree certainty?” predictive questions need framed public discussion. got first dose today may, almost. wtf title. terrible tactic. might technically true didn’t know absolute certain, would unusual vaccine would prevent illness almost entirely still let shed viruses everywhere. Spreading that... maybe lie isn’t right word, immensely overly cautious message discouraged people getting vaccine. Time intermittent fasting, skinny.

However, point, least US, need ride horse rode on. get point Florida terrible example given seem trying hide real numbers Keep getting inoculated, Golden State. reach herd immunity. Finally.. something experts say agree with.

I know we’re tired fed up. myself. fact lot states don’t 10% adult population fully vaccinated yet. time ease restrictions. Towards summer months though little reasonable. Last want virus mutate even completely vaccine evasive. 

But finally expert isn’t saying wear masks even reach herd immunity. studies reason pfizer moderna even try. Also good 3M masks are, least me, breathable cloth masks. part AZ trial found received vaccine getting appointment Moderna vaccine. (AstraZeneca ""unblinds"" appointment vaccine) efficacy Moderna vaccine higher AZ, especially variants, get Moderna one too? Wait boosters later year? I've gone back forth it. Let clarify.

Ruling out... think people hold couple months. Especially pretty soon start slowly reopening stuff watching numbers. Then, people get vaccinated keep increasing reopen. doesn't, shouldn't, simple ""flip switch"" moment carefully controlled ""open bit, see happens, make sure numbers still okay, repeat"" process

Hopefully July/August timeframe we'll almost everyone vaccinated pretty much everything reopen except maybe stuff like packed concert venues. even that, end summer seems like reasonable timeline even safely consider reopening too. Texas (AP) — Texas lifting mask mandate, Gov. Greg Abbott said Tuesday, making largest state end order intended prevent spread coronavirus killed 42,000 Republican governor faced sharp criticism party mandate, imposed eight months ago, well COVID-19 restrictions businesses Texas also scuttle starting next week. mask order ever lightly enforced, even worst outbreaks repealed rules include away limits number diners customers allowed indoors, said Abbott, made announcement restaurant Lubbock. said new rules would take effect March 10, although leaders Houston big Texas cities already reacting statewide mandates end personal responsibility,” said Abbott, speaking crowded dining room many surrounding wearing state mandates longer needed,” decision comes governors across U.S. easing coronavirus restrictions, despite warnings health experts pandemic far over. Like rest country, Texas seen number cases deaths plunge. Hospitalizations lowest levels since October, seven-day rolling average positive tests dropped 7,600 cases, 10,000 California New York reported COVID-19 deaths Texas. Cool, they're trespassing. realize though POLITICAL decision, local &amp; regional leaders staking positions easing appease certain vocal factions. They're vast majority agrees, rather want score points strongest supporters &amp; rabid followers. /r/masks4all   Good luck states. suppose stories leaked saying it’s possible, really means it’s imminent. people infected = mutation posibility = vaccine efficiency decrease = elderly vaccine useless = death

Even mutation, easy take care 100 less risky patient instead 100k less risky patient. deaths level restrictions much higher stop restrictions though. Yea fair , threshold needs met without lockdown restrictions comparable flu. possible vaccinations progress. thought year going better.

A user r/texas sub described perfectly: like we're putting fire, right we've gotten embers, Abbott pours gasoline it. Un. Be. Liveable. Good luck Texas Sounds good! reduce spread long-term ailments! Ridge girl, hasn’t even one year ani 15 days stop spread. could year half schooling lost?

I’m kids going back school. science backs up. It’s completely safe. You’re one wants keep kids locked up.

I wear mask. distance strangers. go bars spaced. I’ve never tested positive covid. fuck Im spending year house watching Netflix. Call whatever want. whole ""outdoor gatherings banned"" saw California better identified bad restriction implemented future. premature opening ever worked covid? 

What's definition insanity - *Doing thing expecting different result* ? much result widespread misinformation rampant individualism. Yeah man, totally die flu wear masks, they’re country full old people. don’t use actual stats make sense, like 100k people, many die flu year? Japan ranked 1 year STILL need explain people masks work? RemindMe! 2 months Got real “mission accomplished” vibes. Congrats, Texans! Hope state gets someday. Yay, we'll add back carbon emit people flying around reason! friend Naples said everything open mask mandates. went barhopping said like Covid exist. akin betting black. constantly monitoring cases/hospitalizations/deaths decision made based numbers. I'm guessing decided risk hospitals overrun minimal and, therefore, time open up. agree decision.

Also, I'm pretty sure governor said would re-evaluate things got control. remember exactly said that. quite paying attention part, since felt like happen. I’ve come across unsettling amount people want get vaccinated. hope change minds soon Wtf talking about? saying ""why dont scientists communicate effectiveness vaccines?"" thought thats saying whole time. state top 3 variants relaxes restrictions?

What could go wrong. Yeah, shame FDA using fact research-based approach could crossed fingers gone wild! think batshit insane people sub left couple months ago good news started getting posted. Fauci never actually said though. Everyone trashing Flordia hard whole pandemic numbers compared lot states bad despite old population limited restrictions. time start admitting may handled right? Texas officially strongly recommending masks social distancing even Executive Order goes effect. variant emerges resists vaccines, widespread restrictions probably end early mid 2022. We’re potentially doubling length pandemic point us can’t wait summer roll back restrictions sub young get vaccine. Bound happen Twitter always nutjobs wherever look, pre post-Covid. know handful high quality trackers fast vaccine going out, many cases deaths are, on- anyone made tracker restrictions lifted state level? know would difficult town level track businesses still enforcing public health measures, would interesting see restrictions lifted watch grow time.

Off top head, believe Florida, Iowa, Texas, Mississippi, Montana ^(I think?) states lifted mask mandates, number absolutely expect see grow approach majority initiating vaccination national level. anyone access regularly updated map I'd excited save it. that's true, variant cause vaccine ineffective, beating this..because time another vaccine comes variant, new variant appear..and on. way beat everyone stays inside another year...fuck that. get it, get point. Virginia (although smoker isn’t eligibility point here... yet) Oh, agree states restrictions made locality socioeconomics mind? Except anyone who’s said vaccines prevent spread called conspiracy theorist mention mandatory quarantine Hopeful public health scientist actually study restrictions effect ones much. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm california personally think state's level strictness led things worse. Everything shut people got annoyed started gatherings houses. bar restaurant year know tons people gatherings/parties/people over. mean, point Texas: “Here, hold mask watch this!” Everyone wants vaccine one April. huge mistake, guess see. Texas determined science data telling open. don’t see issue Glad find people weeds Doom Gloom agree mistake vaccinate everyone. long term health consequences extreme. Young people die often Coronavirus, linger hospital months develop long term health problems body take punishment older person preexisting conditions. didn’t occur post offices count federal property. local post office, half employees don’t wear mask all, rest wear nose. Nearly one going ever wears one I’ve seen.   Because...math.

Woot! Lezgo! ITT: Stupid people. Mississippi still Covid restrictions. mask mandate optional. Texas hand removed everything Yes year ago. I'm sure noticed things changed quite bit since then. Yo, need close borders...OUT Texas. knew gonna screwed summer going everyone going wild free, Jesus. Big true mean disrespectful, experts seem agree position.

Lots talk plateau regarding numbers, means we've hit post holiday travel baseline, numbers showing growth. end.

That understanding something evolution mutations. I'm fairly sure know that's happening, since everywhere now. 

How plan stop plan? get you’re going way require law emergency order. Flu season doesn’t qualify emergency way anybody codifying masking. None. 
If state government won’t can’t mandate it, it’s like cities Walmart going stick necks out. love this. White House hopefully gave Governors target easing restrictions: June 1st. give quick summary nursing home stuff? would google never know article click spinning it. It'll good masks. Hopefully, habits stick around afterwards. first season stricken cold flu, might mask autumn/ winter out. amount people died lockdown states got back Hawaii. Covid barely there. Go there. Thank later. (I ate dinner restaurant without mask safe normal awesome). truly minority, mean majority happy decision? Sounds like democracy thing. I'm sorry situation, also sympathy majority isolated year virus risk tolerance order protect people like you. answered blood like safety book says, written blood. refuse follow safety measures end causing needless deaths. Unfortunately pandemic restrictions form managerial control. ""Don't look tip pencil walking"" strong suggestion, prevent it. LETS GO TEXAS !! Thats take stand thing something that's supposed difference maker vaccines. roll lift restrictions curfews STILL go up, danger going people wonder point getting vaccine is. already health officials touting variants say can't anything getting here. many mixed messaging going talking heads general public fed confused all.

That point start considering opening back society. now, when? always reinstate mandates things go south, hoping best here, least try get things back normal. hospitals stayed capacity correct? logic it’s time start easing restrictions cannot come sub anymore information. Everything slight concern downvoted. Hellllllll yesssss! Summer 2021 gonna lit!!! know Biden lowballing well! predict April 1 vaccine appointments available people, May already seeing low demand due fact people want vaccine already vaccinated! Every adult would 250m.

If 70% get it, thats 175m.

Most likely fight hard vaccine youll get well May, early April maybe general population. 

LETS FUCKKKINNN GOOOOO Nah. Good shot though. way, I’m done experts. someone developing country even started vaccinating anyone yet, 90-180 days behind USA seems optimistic. lol.. think pretty well right now? Annual Prostate Yeah, I've hard time symptom diary differentiating vaccine reactions 'I trapped house 11 months' reactions. 


That's interesting get second round opposite injections. I'm Novavax well got single round shots. BRB CRYING. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Hope you’re right buddy. Hope you’re right.

Edit: “Buddy” sounds condescending, mean sincerely. *posted internet connected device* lmao Yikes reply makes sense. death rate Florida lower US average Well, Texas removed it, wait governor follows (I hope mine doesn't). think everyone “screw it” date mind. seem unlikely? bunch people start crowding bars without masks hospitals absolutely overrun. 

Basically seeing end xmas surge, declaring victory logic, reason, science. Pre-November levels nothing brag about. think huge mistake. flown Texas see family year. hoping people vaccinated might safe travel summer still taking precautions, this? guess watch see happens, throwing wrench plans reason. absolutely reason can’t pretty much back normal fall. None. know article less hour feel like absolutely huge news (in good way) It'll interesting see timeline looks like terms getting shots people's arms. supply end may, mass vaccination push first part June yeah... actually fully reopen stuff July 

4th July gonna different. Cause think lot people still understandably nervous, ""is really over? really gone? going variant comes fucks us again?"" mood. people who'll want balls wall party. gonna people gonna perfectly happy ""lets start something small even super nice"". long data shows everything actually safe, completely fine approaches. it'll interesting see plays out.  I'm sure lot places rounding up. Like little corner pizza joint 35% would 4.6235 tables, yeah I'm gonna put 5. well should. think that’s going surprise people most. get societal realities hard tell people hang months everybody see case graphs vaccine coverage indicates isn’t legitimate risk another spike. Anything past extreme risk avoidance. easy access low impact workouts, (varying location) definitely mental physical aspects pandemic made chronic pain worse.  Good lord comments scary. medical implications illness, need know better treatment. everything negative deemed fear mongering. curve unflattens (which won't), governor re-evaluate restrictions, like many states countries past year. without control group, data functionally useless. 


If vaccinate group similar people 0.1% contract illness, that's great, way knowing whether that's matter coming contact virus vaccine effective. 


If control group, 10% contract illness, vaccine group results 0.1% contraction, shown quantifiable reduction transmission. 


That said, there's lot ethical considerations happening generally apply 'normal' medical trial, understand. example, presented opportunity receive vaccine, medical emergency, become pregnant, call immediately unblind tell whether I'm vaccinated. phase 2 trials have, end periods, informed recipients received vaccine administered real vaccine placebo group end study. 

&amp;#x200B;

If want know it, one favorite comedy podcasts - normally covers historical medical oddities - [did episode doctor talks vaccine general experience plot thickens... Health care workers vaccinated point. want play Russian roulette means spin Darwin wheel. feel bad people choice whether around people not. Personally, never visiting brick mortar store ever again, I'm sure many people feel way. surprised. lot companies falling back ""In accordance government mandate..."". gone, companies defend mask usage company choice instead something made do. going see lot companies away mandates simply want deal assholes. remember Desantis banned people NYC almost there. summer going spectacular. able go maskless July would amazing. heat thing ever really made nuisance. States open according science data tells them. Yes, think large portion vaccinated. Even aren’t, racing toward, herd immunity, point new infections going drop many people previously infected vaccinated.

Granted, shit still happen derails this... remain optimistic. afraid we've still done none actual work defeat pandemic.

do think cartoon pandemic villain simply ""defeat""? whole comment honestly one less informed, fearmongering statements I've seen past day seems like distribution getting better, probably continue trend, bet won’t -too- wild believe means actually able get then, too. Lol triage extended capacity.

But whole medical system overworked.

When getting 200 people still hospitalized day. simple. hopeful thing ending summer I've heard Japanese friends specific case-to-case scenario. 

My younger friends, either regular flu maybe covid showed symptoms, given chest X-rays showed way meds.

But older friends 50+ years old, we're talking even 8-10+ months ago, simply walked clinic could testing got it. Like questions asked, even symptoms. 

For part, find Reddit internet trying evaluate certain countries incomplete data rumors. Like, hold Japan testing standards US--which seems like get tested every week feel like it. Testing whatnot essencial, agree whatever mindset Japan has... can't bash country internet wants to. needed life today. go around people wearing masks feel safe. two-way street family received first doses. First time year I’m feeling super optimistic. Booking cruise birthday next year TEXAS OUTSIDE....LETS GO....SUMMER Yes, mask mandate definitely helped us get here. vaccinations take us finish line. get second dose 20 days, I'll get go back maternity leave teaching person *only* cloth mask instead n95, cloth mask, face shield combo. Yes, many unknowns year ago. Trump officials help.

But think messaging improved lot, especially since became clear last Fall vaccine would possible. Then, matter time.

What, really, confusing college educated person? Science, especially refers human organism, always uncertainties need adapt learn. Maybe college education include mandatory research classes learn research works. would excellent — maybe start shipping surplus countries need. knew think became best friends. Gee, thanks contribution discourse. This. Texas odd hell. Works tbh. balancing open it’s safe summer 2022 we’re lucky mindsets.  take money taxpayers don’t like politics governing administration? CDC require states mandate mask wearing?

Petty tyrants are. I’m outside really near anyone, absolutely not. Fuck, maybe actually find RTX 3080 $2000. Yall need get back outside play games peace. Wearing masks public norm Japan way thought global pandemic anyone's mind. Coupled fact island makes comparitively isolated Japanese known stay line told understand well. agree. honestly think threads let people live heads much. suppose shall see. thing is, people really taking seriously months now, really see much effect numbers. China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore fairly control snap lockdowns mass testings there. Well, vaccines work, yeah, there's finish line. Thats precisely COVID bill funds kids next years - pay resources help catch :) No. means adults want vaccinated fully vaccinated end June. Mid-July full immunity. old news bro. one cares anymore. dude needs done Without trump one scapegoat. Re-opening boost numbers Basically meme years, Office's Dwight declaring need new plague. Texas: “July? Hahaha try tomorrow” WW2 lot military strategy, code breaking, tech new time, etc, think pandemic also studied LONG time. mean....the entire WORLD basically shut almost year. drastically affected world economy, logistics, pollution, animal migrations, global mental health, insane experiment reveals MUCH world currently works, amazing petri dish - again, like WW2, supremely sucks live learned, continue learn far future, really interesting. *feel* better now!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* prediction Texas mandate masks? mid-July. Lol that’s feel 😂 Good! Yes. Open Texas Texans let step foot state unless vaccinated.  jokers thread need someone tell take shit going take lawsuit open Illinois rest way. think people think took seriously think methods used counter virus either necessary worked well advertised. also believe people getting tired constant shaming gone much questioned science behind solutions (which shaming FINALLY called here). 

I think anyone really doubted virus real outside hard-core conspiracy theorists. Seriously, ones screaming anything 5G ones trying debunk conspiracy theory long abandoned (have noticed often media cites one even though I've yet see anyone even utter anything CLOSE months?). get tired constantly called every form hysteric label much step outside house without mask so. *extremely pop punk voice*
I’ve got picture, I’m coming you, dear Moderna count in!  Good, hope applied vaccines, western ones. I’m fully vaccinated still sitting cubicle 8-12 hours day wearing mask like past 11 months. Can’t wait take off. feel unsuccessful? prediction Texas? vaccines numbers dropping like six months? Let's gooooo! can't wait never check subreddit again. remember 25k subscribers else Amazon Walmart going make much money possible? ... take store? see everyone ready party 1920s. Coming First World War deadly flu pandemic… people must ready something didn’t involve life death change. Shit don’t tell Reddit. place wants corona last forever.  People still say 40 cases reinfections since beginning pandemic covid creeping death.  half people dont even know. time nut   Selfishness slightly problem stupidity think. antimaskers decided comfortable personal risk don’t care they’re killing vulnerable people think, hope guess I'm expert, J&amp;J vaccine help distribution issues seen. Since kept standard refrigerator need coordination follow dose...that could one gets private pharmacies opposed hospitals deep freeze storage. J&amp;J could go large companies well inoculate work forces. miss something? airlines rescind mask mandate? half. Reddit taught anything, we’re TINY minority. “experts” thing though, public health, meet people are. Like STDs, ideal way stop spread everyone monogamous sexual relationships. But, humans gonna human lot sexual partners. So, recommending condom use would best way go reducing spread. Masks encouraging outdoor gatherings opposed indoor would covid equivalent. mean Texas even open Florida? Israel many cases pet day still?  Within Canada, Whitehorse Yukon vaccinating adults.  heart attack November attest mental strain medical issue manifesting physical pain either actually there, serious: brain focusing danger area. It’s trauma. It’s possible people bad COVID survived also going form stress trauma compounded global anxiety virus.

I like take would like studied! think lot research come coming years many ideas researched. think shatmyself delight Canadian jealousy intensifies.

But likely good news us Canadians well, less risk cross boarder spread hopefully production lines help supply us vaccines June beyond. going counties cities. ""Hold Lone Star""-Texas Sounds like probably take Summer Olympics it. know whats missing? exit strategy lunatics supporting ever moving end game save another life ones detached reality. prob shut remain way - decision. know assuming. Actually area state seems really variable town. immediate town neighboring city whole good masks like whereas neighboring one day first place I'd since started absolutely noone wearing masks attempting sort social distancing. 

Incidentally, various mandates protecting people like protecting us, included. NY everyone wearing mask highest cases per 100k right now.

That's test 200-300k per day never said COVID flu, like never said COVID drunk driving. Stop putting words mouth.

Why want mandate masks flu season? could save lives? People culture changes. happens. Perhaps mandates people decide wear them, what's harm?  Mask use randomly controlled proven efficacy. 

That's Misinformation.  Also let's recognize common sense physical barrier covering mouth nose stop spread germs inhaling peoples. hell use word like ""Efficacy"" still require form proof. 

Honestly absurd even still talking point. People seem think tours/festivals thrown together days. That's shit works. festivals early career, year long process. though? making virus antibodies, spreading it? Hell no. timeline holds summer weddings going insane celebration. ready I've never flu life decided needed get bed go visit parents. Last summer fucking frustrating. Even largest outdoor bars limited capacity 500 cases per day (out 8,000,000) Smokers phase 1B, everyone 65 older. Yes, that's see it. Labs outline establish limits, tracing experiments confirmation.

My main problem governments deliver tracing data least describe sources claims.
For example, anyone actually test people got food delivery outbreak restaurants? even ask positive people delivery contacts? 

In UK, started debate joggers infecting others. believe that's problem, unless follow really closely longer period. there's experts believe risk public, others say bullshit (which guess is).

But government would present data 50 high-ventilation gyms positive cases trained, compared low-ventilation ones, would put end debate. dirty details, perhaps would still significant risk follow jogger half hour so, public feels threatened joggers passing by, data would enough.

If really horrible deep exhalation near someone infect regularly, good, least evidence CCTV shops something like put end debates, sound basis mask mandates. honestly, believe this, antibody rates shop workers approach 100%. can't get 100% people anything

Being able get vaccine forcing everyone take it. WH pushing governors set date lol Yet somehow problem pointing new Zealand comparing United States apples oranges get Imagine paying taxes healthcare even sure vaccinated end year. June 18th mine!!! Lucky you. ""suffered"" symptoms really strong cold flu. Well, got antibody test today curiosity (even though know say shouldn't...). Came back positive, explain fever then. 

I'll still staying study though, really changing behavior despite knowing that. flip side Disneyland’s overall higher show quality Disney World largely thanks need continue bring local AP holders. Disney World international draw, management knows guests buying tickets year advance coming 5,000 miles away won’t cancel yeti broken. Disneyland, draws locals Florida parks (and managed entirely separate entity different priorities), guarantees. Same, feel like I'm still going wary crowds, like, anyone coughing sneezing public.

That's gonna take time get used again. shit. half everything. Plus getting sued right one product right now. Sure funny let make ""vaccine"" Two weeks. keep getting downvoted industry. really going back strong 2022. stuff may happen locally going massive tours awhile. timeline person going different. Though things like festivals think politics public perception delay longer probably necessary. 

You may already feel safe going things before, albeit maybe mask moving around. 

Then course people continue quarantine avoid others, possibly years indefinitely. big spectrum. People right thing. Businesses right thing. Governments right thing. lmao. Florida 10,000 covid deaths entire country Canada despite \~15 million less people.

It looks ""not bad all"" US absolute nightmare. Peter Griffin get elected governor bof Mississippi? .7% positivity stand counter alone eating slice pizza NYC American, not. Abbott's order said: ""Individuals strongly encouraged wear face coverings nose mouth wherever feasible maintain six feet social distancing another person household, **but person may required jurisdiction wear mandate wearing face covering**.

Seems way. Sounds like privilege Every things bigger Texas; except variant ready fight 2nd amendment rights. glass always half empty...huh? Fish man something! see hit homeruns person, man, experience That's great.  I've always figured administeration become huge bottleneck April so, sooner States, that's good bottleneck have, instead supply.

I can't see adminsteration going later July early August. problem real scientific study responsible thing assume stop vaccinated individuals spreading. expectation people know things always studies would eventually show vaccine prevented spreading vaccinated individuals. again, irresponsible assume without solid evidence. many lives stake. Biden redistribute vaccines states mask mandates? Vaxxmax.com open scour rite aid additional tab everything filled except location right aid.  another vaxxmax tab open Walgreens another tab Walgreens ready rock. 

Also start notice stores repeatedly pop day. may want focus refreshing specific store repeatedly opens up. 

Hope helps. BINGO!!!!! Damn, turns people don’t like government telling go, do, jobs “essential”.

Stunning. actually feel optimistic first time nearly year. Antibiotics regularly significant side effects. Shitting brains pretty common, example.

You ever actually taken antibiotics spitballing? keep mask mandate place preparation 2021-2022 flu season later year? pretty harmless, right? yea, least wear damn mask reduce spread even new strain coming out. speech mentioned available doses, administered doses, middle/end June seems reasonable everyone actually vaccinated. risk people vaccinated end March beginning April really, normative perspective, that's date matters trip friend's house store probably endangering anyone point. Americans cry 24/7 canadian elections, obnoxious. Extremely fact. Cool anecdote batman. PA mandated masks since mid April last year still 3-4 different spikes varying levels. Masks seem make difference literally see maskless person store year. yeah basically anecdote trumps anecdote rabble rabble rabble Ignorance bliss Oh gosh yes, CANNOT breathe exercising mask. can't. wear one gym, chosen running alone areas get near someone, simply cannot breathe running wearing mask, even paper mask. We're third world country wearing gucci belt, doncha know 😒 forget bleach UV light  think myth vaccines reduce transmission still stuck minds lot people. teachers school staff vaccinated, parents vaccinated, grandparents, day care workers, etc, chance kid contracting COVID reduces point worth worrying unless child immunocompromised. Even people immunocompromised children able rest easier vaccination rates high. Go Texas! got this! FWIW, mods saw votes, would used differently. French authorities trying convince people take actually really freaking good.

? 

It's compared options. Lot side effects less efficacy, thanks. true, wouldn’t say places culture mask wearing reason dont know, isnt backed data, many regions ignoring real world results question asking.

Az works perfectly fine 65s, 80% reduction hospitalization 80's.  Canada best friend America ever had

False! Canada probably #4 list. ""special relationship"" like one UK, ended 1970s. we're lucky it'll small. can't count lucky. clear evidence past year effect mask mandates slowing spread disease, long medical experts continue recommend them. Given harmless wearing mask is, really last step removed ending response pandemic. Actually mRNA vaccine manufacturing faster easier traditional vaccines future. reason slow time it’s completely new manufacturing process production facilities changed adapt that. mistakingly assuming large population vaccinated time. Hnnghhh. God damnit, Texas. you’re Texas HEB refreshes every minute store openings. takes lot refreshing good timing able get scheduled within hours trying get one. drive south Austin north Austin bad Saturday. Also available schedule end day. take parent partner ask cancellations excess doses bottle. don’t want toss them. Yes, CAN’T yet. That’s states like Illinois committing dates, numerous things could impact date one way other. suppose know better president governor, right? You’re supposed wait 2 weeks quarantine reschedule per state. anybody know whether vaccine could potentially help CFS/ME sufferers? friend CFS I’ve heard compared long-Covid I'm reopenings, seems tad soon sudden. California (my home state), go 100% overnight. Hold can't wait like another month two. vaccination rates actually would support that.  fools won’t get vaccine. It’s going circulate years way politicized. Shameful unfortunately unavoidable. mention circulate within populations people countries poor get citizens vaccine. 

# Canada vaccine committee advises AstraZeneca vaccine 65+

# Canada’s National Advisory Committee Immunization released new guidelines Monday advise vaccinating people 65 years older AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, citing lack information efficacy age group. I’m blow dart. seems socially distant solution hope happens California! Particularly SoCal, hospitalizations deaths decreasing rapidly, percentage positive tests low (less 3 percent), yet case number match bar set, opinion asking way, way much. May 8 here. Either going tiny bit early, first social gathering long time guests. Same, it’s end May. I’m unsure push summer again, wheres difference? outcome ... even u take mask vaccinated people, u still spread virus. get it?  Don’t forget Valentine’s Day spike! exception every part US tho well Disney Dark Finally!!! Maybe cause states follow suite! thing surprises this, beat Desantis it.  Dont quote believe Pfizer also found need vaccines super frozen, means normal pharmaceutical truck freezers carry now. Living means accepting people pretty much 0 risk this. elderly risk vaccinated opportunity be, over. nothing people worried Listening Americans discuss masks think burn skin something, it’s not. “Experts” saying even vaccine, still work social distance wear masks 2022. Many saying permanent changes society. always another goalpost end people say enough. compared COVID flu. essentially stated wearing masks COVID would similar wearing masks flu. COVID flu. Masks work mortality level even close.

..and compared COVID drunk numbers showed could save anywhere near levels people saved wearing COVID, probably should. Hell, society promoting mask wearing sick flu season. common many places.  main difference flu vaccinations readily available all, masks seemed effective flu. Right state vaccinations readily available all, masks shown way effective COVID. top CDC recommending actions. Based scientific knowledge combined sort common sense restrictions fully lifted right now.

Flu vaccines [40%-60% 

Why need save certain number lives support mask mandate? Heaven forbid wear piece cloth mouth nose months. Best case, people die would died. Worst case, vaccination rates keep mutations virus becomes neverending cycle kills one every 700 (current total texas 1:650) residents every year. reference point, that's 36x people killed drunk driving accidents.

Seriously, way possibly think good idea absolutely terrible basic math. anything reduction flu cases 2020 shown us, people need stay hell home whenever symptoms. agree you. quit gym it. don’t know “fitness culture” decided contracting virus smart, healthy choice, has. Unfortunately, that’s way Florida. 🤷‍♀️ 

I doubt think contracting ""healthy choice"" rather see 99.8% chance survival, probably relatively healthy (going gym) deem risk acceptable get value release workout.

Everyone different risk tolerances. Personally feel like people less tolerance wait vaccine let young folks get back living LET'S GOOOOOOOOO! correct, edit comment. dont give shit even without first qualifier. Texans, I'm fucked. want support small business open up, get it, what's wrong mask? Hope so, point stores make point requiring masks don’t give business. It’s always another couple months. ignoring science. Science says children die Covid, 

Why mean science says that? MIS-C long term effects don’t yet fully know hasn’t actually long.

Could please provide data referring to? I’ve asked already yet you’ve failed so. didn’t say were, glad agree?

So, arguing though data regarding deaths/cases ppl 20 mobile formatting already annoying, 

So, actually don’t data support you’re arguing. I’m mobile rom already posted I’m going sort statistics you. 


So, don’t it. Got welcome fairly easy google searches find CDC information (or plenty health publications) legitimately interested. 

So, can’t actually provide data support argument demanding you? actually haven’t provided data comment chain 

I provided two links detailing rates children contract, symptoms deaths covid even one comparing flu. 

Please take moment look them. I’m claiming data wrong, 

What data provided disputing? claiming you, person chain said nothing children don’t die wrong. 

They’re aren’t dying according data provided. Please take moment review data clue what’s context is. obviously factually whether “anomaly” have. 

Again, take moment read data provided understand discussion going here. what? even attempt create disinformation? 

I provided data covid cases death rate children. I’d yore claiming wrong please support accusation. can’t you’re nothing spreading said factually incorrect. 

Are still disputing data ""an attempt sensationalize topic"", started entire conversation. 

Why sensationalizing buy providing data covid cases death made general comment (to different user) long term issues possible, 

Could provide science you’re referring are, like said user despite likely survive still want contract it.

Again, substantiate you’re arguing? talking end goal agree general comment another user tried turn kind weird pissing match me. 


Why trying discredit data I’ve provided regarding children catching nothing policy moving forward discussed user even prior interaction.

So, you’re fear mongering since whatever reason problem data provided showing children 20 aren’t dying pushing fear kind. 

Denying science data pushing anything, actually didn’t even reply chain begin replied someone else took upon tell “It’s like ppl outright ignore data science push unsubstantiated fear mongering”. 

Why ignoring science? goal come act like children 20 dying rates adults look back chain see advocating thing person was, catching covid despite age group likely survive still don’t want system cause long-term issues. 


So trying deligitimize science data exist regarding children said anything isn’t searchable relatively easy find. 

So, can’t provide anything support you’re arguing verify quick search MIS-C long-term effects people 20 die covid. 

So, don’t actually data can’t speak intelligently said came CDC, Yale Medicine, WHO, Mayo clinic probably couple others forgotten. 

Can provide discuss one trying say people 20 don’t die (false) 

What false data provided? Please lasting effects (also false current “long term” are). 

I didn’t say that. asked provide details you’re claiming I’m regards to
Long term effects children haven’t. disagree number dead long term illness smaller younger age group, 

Drastically less data provided shows. honestly don’t understand got point bringing stuff never mentioned general comment made someone else. 

You calling question data provided regarding covid children you’re looking debate someone don’t time energy might want try find somewhere else. Hope wonderful day.

Seriously, don’t try discredit actual science especially you’re unable provide support anything you’re arguing. could forgiven thinking so. We've *de facto* 100% open mask order since August last year. makes embarrassingly official gives extra round ammo anti-masker base. **Austria decided recommend AstraZeneca vaccine 65s, one week indicating would.** 

In total, 11 27 EU member countries declined recommend vaccine 65s. 

Neighbouring Switzerland declined approve vaccine entirely – [and considering selling 5.3 million doses already Yassss, get US done rest us get access US vaccine manufacturers! Great news! global battle, every vaccination gets us closer longterm victory Absolutely, tell us hospitalization per 100,000 state county able lift restrictions. least put number look debate it. Right half country going ""whenever Cuomo Newsome feel like safe enough stop wearing masks"". Ugh school district work planning “in car drive in” graduation early JUNE! least supposedly willing improve virus transmission improves. people pessimistic don’t realize vaccination progress made March April May. Vaccines still protect variant wonder hit inflection point supply demand problem start convincing unvaccinated go get shot. name moment occurs? point really care people wanting vaccines want get mine soon come summertime going annoying things like concerts still stay closed stubborn people. agree. like measuring sprinters speed second start suggest would take 30s finish 100m race.

Expected doses received June alone 5-7 times much doses recieved Herd immunity better honor system. Hopefully vaccine fast. long there’s Republican governors, we’re fucked. Sorry. Half million dead, despite fact us gave honest effort protect other. number would far higher otherwise, would far lower people like morally ethically bankrupt.  Except every medical antibiotic I’ve ever side effects. Every restriction does. I'm curious, CPR certified?  site says, ""If treated COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies convalescent plasma, wait 90 days getting COVID-19 vaccine."" Otherwise says wait recovered.  What's eye opening last year shown pathological individualism done US. made good chunk society sociopathic. People can't even comply *small* ask order literally save lives. opens whole new levels trolley problem. want pull lever lets go one track back show can. Yeah...about Except fat people apparently. 

-sighs chubby vaccinate everyone wants one, need keep anything closed. Things closed protect health care system, going issue soon. Maybe that's part cases still important. 

Cases lead longer-lasting effects, hospitalizations, likely permanent damage. Cases also allow reservoir virus mutate possibly new strain emerging sets us back year progress. \\\\

So really important people double staying safe last stretch. Especially since hope may permanent. I'm pretty sure said WELL fitting masks lot higher 5 percent. even say mask wearing prevent 5 percent less cases. That'd change 28.7 mil cases 30.2 mil cases. 1% mortality rate 15 THOUSAND lives. Let alone money saved treating 1.5 mil infections money gained productivity lost due 1.5 mil infections. policy stand point masks simple. Little cost. large gain money saved public health It’s funny many people saying masks saving grace. commenters seem good opening full capacity (as long people still wear masks) thing is, cloth face protect covid, flu, many things. I’m jealous Texas, can’t wait Michigan open back up. It’s time SAME! SICK of...

Pandemic

All stuff never imagined late 2019, would become part regular vocabulary many regions hesitant release 65+? aren't.

What I'm saying is, bulk supply next month vaccines work perfectly fine 65+ anyways, uncertainty use AZ risk people 65.

Scheduling people one type versus makes 0 difference rollout since they'll get used anyways. mean ending mask madidate certainly going help anything Well, clearly hyperbolizing emphasize don’t care people do... ok go off. 

Secondly what’s problem people wearing masks absence mandate? us aren’t afraid dying this, we’d rather get begin with. job do, I’ve busy pandemic ever before. 

Freedom means freedom wear mask want. problem that?? Incredible news!  


I can't tell great wake every day better better news vaccine! always bad back. I'm 31 can't really remember time pain free.

It got bad pandemic ended going urgent care tears exist excruciating pain lower back.

I'm better first time life I'm pain free, really bad there. zoonotic disease Amazon rainforest limitless potential wildlife reservoirs every jump humans animals results mutation human human transmission. Every species jump, like bat cat, greater degree

This works all. [Bats unique ability let viruses mutate within strike balance defense viruses ability simply tolerate presence without symptomatic illness.

In general, though, longer SARS-CoV-2 stays within zoonotic reservoir, *less* well adapted become human ACE-2 TMPSSR2. wonder means end May supply ready warehouse somewhere actually get jabbed same-day. Yes. Like, part even controversial? understand reasonableness particular criteria debate, need criteria first place debate? aren’t people calling states define criteria? would imagine you’d want know criteria lifting restrictions matter fall restriction-strictness spectrum US idea enough vaccines, theoretical even practice number vaccines get arms one day? Could see mass 24 hour vaccine sites? actually incorrect. checked Syria Venezuela actually lot obese overweight. Oh shut  Yes? joking? People stacked hallways Italy New York. furloughed. 

Because covid.. Turns need less nurses global pandemic since elective surgery happen. Lets pretend hospitals short staffed though nurses covid units. Travel nurses seeing contracts many many times usual high rate. 

I'm saying need lockdown. lockdown months. mean get rid mask mandates know reduce spread. vaccine literally rolled right now. really kill wear mask months global pandemic? 

I guess understand selfish. think original post saracasm Meaning I'm confident international travel allowed places want go (SE Asia). I'm vaccinated would go anywhere, want another trip cancelled me, happened several times last spring already.  Capitalists shanmed fined promoting sick days privilege. Southern California currently zero indoor dining occupancy (unless restaurant happens flouting rules). know stay way 3 months, see least 6 weeks perhaps 2 months, especially LA County, unless something drastically changes local leaders view COVID restrictions. can’t imagine large portion population vaccinated outside would cause surge. Hopefully wrong. reason still dealing scale morons keep do, saying stupid shit like ""if think people dealt untill... ""

Those people things drug long, 500k people dead, going drag far longer still. care people get sick die. fine heaven forbid wear piece cloth mouth nose months.

Just decline suddenly make fine still save lives one simple action difficult do. Hell, Texas even reached pre October levels. fine fine now, well, unless give shit needless deaths. Todays update J&amp;J it. 

Its also ""highest Tuesday"" mostly double previous average Tuesdays.

Im guessing based current rate companies committed Mid Late April move supply issue demand issue.  2 years ill disneyland, imagine so. Get line, vaccinate me. find alone, walking vax site, troubled, recieve doses, virus spread!

brothers! inject life, gives near full immunity. sure. people outdoors, reason masks mandated. pointing going on. mask mandate lifted 70% people vaccinated cases down, down, down, yes. lift it, months people vaccinated (hopefully enough) cases down, seems stupid. explain mean mass re-infections ""manaus variant"", heard anything either things. ok J &amp; J vaccine less valuable people works out. Blacks worth 3/5 normal human beings getting deserve 66% effective vaccine.

The wealthy affluent, white areas get good vaccines, working class get shitty vaccine.

I'll trust CDC's decision, like ordered everyone wear masks wanted elite monopolize supply.

Our “hard” lockdowns maybe 50% best I'm clutching pearls thinking horrors... /s would imagine many states watching closely. result basically determine whether restrictions continue not. us NYC remember Cuomo punished us bad numbers Florida Texas. something weekend. reason Sunday Monday traditionally less new cases deaths compared Wednesday Thursday. Remember put release numbers days vaccines actually values day before. Thats theyre put early day. agree majority said, fairness shitload mixed signals coming various offices led lot confusing messaging. state went ""2 weeks flatten curve"" ""Ok summer things back normal"" ""no normal vaccine.""

This seems less confusing messaging, lot unknowns covid early answered time went on. really not. every vaccine provides sterilizing immunity, easier time fighting virus, necessarily preventing carrier transmitting sick. color issue poverty issue though? smattering masks among crowd idiots indoors much less effective full masking among crowd people indoors. Also, folks want continue masking need higher quality masks achieve protection. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

its still possible catch via surfaces, im pretty sure basic stupid explanation much harder catch via surfaces respiratory droplets.

- spend time socializing now, tho remotely, ever before. 

- distinction especially close friends I’d normally see call regularly far-away situational (e.g., book club Christmas) friends blurred good way.

- Extraverted &amp; previously-busy buddies pandemic-careful time everyone seems text time. 

- Relationships introvert buddies deepened tremendously share often. 

- Relationships people didn’t slow pandemic less hold. They’re busy aren’t getting together amount time spend typing friends computer hasn’t increased.

It interesting see things shake virus control. see text-based buddies person often? on-hold relationships snap back?  new pandemic friendships fade?  think yes. restaurants open capacity since mid-pandemic city except period around holidays. built outdoor setups packed constantly. even eating fast food garbage avoid obese, really hard.

Its... pretty damn hard eat fast food often overweight without hungry quite bit.

While agree underlying point small businesses deserve support got, keep mind lot restaurants operating pretty thin margins even pandemic. Others depended customer circumstances may never completely come back.

For concrete example Seattle area.... Since first big outbreak US happened around here, lot big tech companies people WFH week two official city/county/state stay-at-home orders; meant downtown Seattle became ghost town overnight. Around two dozen restaurants catered business lunch crowd went even formal pandemic restrictions. depending WFH trends go here, know many able come back. calm little bit study. studied 248 people, Pfizer vaccine trial tested 44,000 half receiving vaccine. 

According study [“Adult patients excess weight obesity among impacted COVID-19, make 70% U.S. population. Indeed, read Pfizer vaccine trial data, saw familiar group: 70% Pfizer COVID-19 trial participants, like U.S. demographic, overweight accounted vaccine trial shown highly effective 94%. mask mandates start lifted vaccinated folks?? New Zealand exist /s fair, Covid hopefully wouldn’t anywhere besides home. give fuck.

Russia meddles foreign elections poisons detractors impunity. makes feel better, really US, UK, Isreal small handful countries (mostly Asian) actually getting vaccines people.

We fucked EU well (especially Czech Republic, worse Bergamo last year)

But yes. already see us getting left behind they're chomping bit bearing best course action. It’s like people don’t finish antibiotic course. wearing mask recovered invites mutations take hold population. won’t requirement anything it’s beyond emergency approved.

I think you’re way optimistic antivaxxers well. Western vaccines, ""think"" whether corners cut not. results trials public suggest studies well-founded, participant numbers far exceeding pre-Pandemic clinical trials. vaccine skepticism like country? Ireland 95% said take 75% December mean defecate street without public shame? Personally, internal shame would keep that.

However, ""public shaming"" (ie, complaining internet) seem helped. Plenty people go maskless. Okay, wow, you’re really chasing shadows, comments come across extremely anti-vax. definition exactly same, even “through vaccination previous infection”, added recommendation *through vaccination hundreds thousands don’t die*. I’m really sure point you’re trying make there. You’re seeing nefarious intents saying “we recommend vaccination”. definition changed science erased; less zero clue you’re even talking also Covid-19 vaccine prevent reinfection, provide immunity virus, still require masks social distancing.

Every number I’ve seen shows 90-95% effectiveness. That’s nature vaccines, enough provide herd immunity. everyone received vaccine, masks distancing could halted. precautions necessary everyone gets vaccine. issue anti-vaxxers continue spread keep us achieving herd immunity—i.e. protecting immunocompromised thus aren’t benefitted study done California last year estimated asymptomatic population likely 40 times higher identified, meaning us probably even affect us?

Maybe? You’re assuming 40x early days equals 40x today, doesn’t really make sense. even so, said cases deaths keep going up... obviously need greater happened flu?

The flu novel virus starting zero, first all. Second all, COVID extraordinarily transmissible, far far far flu. I.e. precautions work better flu COVID, doesn’t mean they’re ineffective. else think COVID spreads? think there’s unexplained vector masks distancing anyone cancel Black Friday, wanted cancel Thanksgiving?

What hell talking about? Ah, okay, see gears chugging head now. “cancel culture”, nefarious scheme to... cancel Thanksgiving Christmas? People don’t travel Black Friday, first all, holiday concern about. CDC also recommended New Years Super Bowl parties, cancel culture too? pretty sure everyone saying “stay home” also saying “don’t cram pole-to-hole inside Best government cares much health, recommendations healthy living? Take vitamins, eat right, get exercise, get plenty rest?

There 100 quadrillion articles online telling eat healthy, exercise, take vitamins, ton government. included COVID recommendations? exercising hitting macros isn’t gonna protect highly infectious airborne pathogen. Staying away people does. You’re yelling clouds got lots questions, too. Remember taught school, stupid questions. science works.

We questions, we’re asking answering abiding findings. I.e. masking, distancing, getting vaccine achieve herd immunity without incredibly unnecessary deaths. may stupid questions, incredibly stupid people saying incredibly stupid things don’t understand questions ask, much less answers receive. say “that’s science works”, yet you’re sitting questioning vaccines things, like somehow know better entire scientific community. know think you’re enlightened you’re questioning basic science, entire comment incredibly embarrassing highly dangerous. Pfizer? brain fog today too, got first dose yesterday. Fwiw, sounds lot like ""we're extra cautious waiting studies come make sweeping recommendation people resume ordinary activity based assumption vaccinated people spread virus"" rather ""we think vaccinated people likely spreading virus also vaccines allow return normal life indefinitely"". hand, incredibly surprisingly helping J&amp;J.

Where from? want analyze culture death tell people stupid thinking way stand corrected! Gotcha - makes sense. mask wearing becomes kind signaling - including wearing there’s reason to. Thats main issue. live rural canada obviously youre blind whats going urban centres (where vast majority canadians live). restrictions dont make sense you, dont blame that, blame research fucking bad virus population dense areas. 

So yes, complaining still you. businesses town better hope vaccines get fast thats solution. Opening everything letting people die save businesses small town logical, call cruel it. Businesses resurrected, lives cannot. I’m quite stage comfortable indoor dining larger gatherings anything cases locally high risk family vaccinated I’ve started getting together small groups friends (some also vaccinated) things I’ve putting year like getting work done house.  feels weird long basically seeing one besides doctor grocery store workers I’m ready start taking calculated risks. know risk isn’t zero things I’m much better place personally virus year ago even couple months ago. isn’t time get rid precautions yet I’m sure even careful people starting come terms living life vaccines here. isn’t turn yet can’t wait get mine really get back things used enjoy. agree everyone get whatever vaccine can, mean turn brains say vaccines 100%equalpleasestopaskingpeskyquestions.

Only 1 5 recieved one doses compared 1 3 UK. Ok things, even you’re vaccinated, you’re going able society: example, indoor dining, theaters, places people congregate. That’s safety society.

Ok, I'm (and millions others are) things right without vaccinated. TF messaging. start vaccine push wondered separate country safety testing such. worldwide crisis (for example) UK Germany share data trial results together approve vaccine countries? personal level trust German scientist pharmaceutical company less British one. 

Is red tape here? Surely progress would monumentally quicker say Germany took moderna trials, UK AZ, Netherlands biontec etc one countries approved others look data go ""fine me"".  good news never discard Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines.

Excellent news, absolutely, won’t increase output while. take 2 months speed helping bottling longer fully manufacturing vaccine Merck.

It huge help, question. isn’t criticism, observation output won’t change much June. wish infer causation correlation feels hard tie way Macron making bullshit statements efficacy vaccine It’s like “20%” go down. want die that’s choice. Kids trials they’ll get vaccinated well. end type requirement schools too. bottleneck sticking needles people's arms, manufacturing vaccine. that, (and still is) risk virus could mutate beyond efficacy vaccine, still aren’t sure long antibodies last for. Every year there’s risk flu vaccine won’t able stop new strain flu, probably expect possible covid vaccines well. joke compared responsible countries like New Zealand. think lockdown restrictions gone hospitals overwhelmed people's jobs line.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty minor.

**Booster questions think about, answers**

(note: there's difference ""boost"" ""booster"" needs understood.)

(also, what's term mixture sequences, heterogenous? doubt term overthinking?)

(also also, I'm convinced we're definitely going need boosters, fun think about.)

Could booster shot replace second dose prime/boost regimen?

Should booster shot use one sequence mRNA (or identical spike proteins), both/multiple?

For future vaccines, sequence/spike prime/boost different? four spikes/sequences, would make sense two each, four each?

How much trust mutation modeling here? anticipate future mutations include them? good enough yet?

Do need give non-booster doses people recovered infection?

Could ""stretch"" doses mRNA booster priming vaccine that's easier manufacture, maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), boost mRNA booster? Could better faster prime current mRNA sequence boost updated ChAdOx1? Could maybe [this US?]( vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing infection, subsequent variant exposed broaden immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). they'll good broad immunity variety variants, seems likely indication catch spread virus well future. thing happens someone vaccinated exposed new variant. immunity broadened strengthened subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. remember, many people less likely spread virus, pretty unlikely reduced level spread sufficient sustain virus way seen past year. variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing mind changed new information though, take gospel. 

Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know!

NYT [some good fact, [they *

More [good news goodness. like read comments something...  Macron said vaccine appeared “quasi-ineffective people older 65, say 60 years older."" Words right mouth. 

He humiliated EU regulators approved vaccine age groups. He's done terrible damage cost many risk older French citizens lives. American greatness! government working private industry achieve good world. care voted. proud US today. lmao would make asshole? get list bro struggle trust it. beginning told us things horrible take every precaution guessing new developments. one seems really know  said that? There’s big difference “bothering you” wanting wear it. It’s perfectly fine wear one, qualms that. it’s ever present reminder world live still. Getting rid them, many, signifier really amount people absolutely *begging* censorship blows mind.

How exactly Twitter tell misinformation facts? making delineation? Would banned CDC March saying masks don’t work?

Will ban Fauci lying herd immunity?

Sorry fuckin’ stupid. free speech laws Twitter follow them. way business job attempt fucking arbiters truth tf would know?? They’re bunch dweebs coding shittiest social media platform.. doubt. 1/3rd Americans take it: Don’t think actions like Fauci’s actually throws fuel fire conspiracy theories


From I've seen conspiracy theories flourish even truth, I'm sure there's much tradeoff all. Especially pandemic, that's naturally ripe event loonies come out.



Maybe gotten lost text necessarily think public health officials going around lying every second. Obviously erode trust much ruin chances people listening. started masks lie people point reason trust fauci strongly disagree (as explained above). treating dumb provokes dumb behavior we’re essentially leaving devices figure do.


They kinda already though even without conspiracy theory lying stuff. mean really many people still going around today claiming government overstepped bounds telling do? many. coming place ""im grown ass person make decisions"" really they're fucking clueless. That's mean people knowledge tools trying make decisions way league I'd rather keep vaccines keep boarders closed. Fuck trying play victim referring Poe's Law, true. 2 months ago Merck thought would vaccine, J&amp;J still trials point. I'm sure talks started time J&amp;J made submission FDA, takes time work details. Biden probably involved anti-trust reasons anything.

The educated guess course. difference probably level necessity. 

You (generally) go grocery store survive; go Home Depot. There's gotta something psychological people far willing mask actually essential places. ""More people vaccinated us"" implies raw numbers people, percentages. correct way word would ""more population"" something sort. perfectly reasonable people would confused bad wording Real talk, deal family members genuinely think like this? love hard hear talk like vaccine globalist conspiracy. really know tell us. place work, 4 people got shots, within 2 weeks covid positive (after never positive before). work school, which, we’ve told, ‘safe.’ told need 2 shots, hear may seasonal. free believe want. free question want. US wants studies diversity reasons. Medications affect different races differently.

Most countries less diverse.

As countries similar populations, I’m sure. sucks messaging around vaccines. 

Live nyc listening Deblasio press conference specific plan J&amp;J doses receiving. bringing homebound seniors going door door. makes ton sense - less storage requirements one done. Don’t make 2nd round later date. It’s likely poorer neighborhoods/ large minority populations.

He received two questions journalists Q&amp;A giving vaccine lower efficacy minority communities perceived fairness. There’s already high vaccine hesitancy communities seemingly adding it. 

I think good job answering questions saying prevented death + hospitalization trials said take J&amp;J vaccine, still it’s frustrating large discussion.

We top messaging vaccinated need continue living life vaccinated it’s going effect acceptance rates.

At moment supply outstrips demand, come end April going position supply excess demand wondering fucked things. Yeah, almost much eating rather eating. world vaccinated variants keep popping up. billion doses made donated USA good diplomacy. I'll assume troll. Either stupid understand recommendations health experts. covid numbers always were: worse california. Florida achievement response pandemic way. Would like see real published data peer-reviewed literature, maybe even Medrxiv/Biorxiv, rather ""science press release"". saves one life! what's predictions domestic travel US come June? know America always ""open"", really acceptable travel. purchased flights hotels NYC &amp; Boston hoping 100 days America lot different comparable major historical event would compare happened whole Reddit around lol? There’s major power wars, pandemics scale, anything scale lifetimes, let alone Reddit’s lifetime Hey Scotland bad eradicate virus

Lol needs explained much better often people keep screaming ""well what's point vaccine still lockdowns masks?!"". Chill, man, working, takes us. DAE America 3rd world? 

Nooo America give shots. Isn’t known virus spread outdoors, especially sunlight? I'm still cautious since I've 1 dose Pfizer/Biontech. Sure I'll start feeling relaxed 14 days 2nd dose (since take long 2nd dose reach full efficacy, immediately within days). 2 weeks 1st dose may technically enough prevent getting sick enough end hospitalized death still feel comfortable letting guard down. Seems like J+J effective mRNA 1 dose, 2nd dose mRNA ones higher efficacy rates (in preventing illness, vaccines available US seem nearly 100% effective preventing death). dangerous likely cause death healthy, young people, shown causes long term even permanent lung damage and/or cardiovascular damage even low-risk groups. Even people asymptomatic. much talk Spanish flu, probably comparable modern pandemic?

As far horsemen go, war favored pestilence whatever reason. US' market regulated fuck

Haha, good joke. Pharmaceutical industry modify price medicine 10,000%, food products sold basically whatever hell it, job market minimum wage half be. US heavily regulated market, I'm pope. Macron step down. Absolute shit show there. faith! Vaccine rollout going great. re: Cuomo, possibly one good thing horrific harassment stories restrictions probably loosen faster. See CA: legislator/governor/mayor gets unpopular, people's behind tighter restrictions try open faster ""win back"" popularity. (For example think moderate-Dem push reopen schools come really quickly result unhappy parents.) Bagged lettuce often labeled prewashed normal times would agree you.

The question ""who decides"" unfortunately always relevant, even we're talking facts data. You’re following I’m saying. 

I’m saying “its specific number”.

I’m saying individual person,.. risk “unknown number”. (IE = shouldnt make assumptions). 

Its massive (and potentially deadly) mistake think:... “Well (generalized statistics) say 18-30yr olds X-% risk,.. individual risk also EXACTLY identical X-%.”

Thats wrong thinking. None works like that. Going grocery store gonna major risk now.

Human Challenge Trials Vaccine Development: regulatory considerations

&amp;#x200B;

**Human Challenge Studies Accelerate Coronavirus Vaccine argue studies, accelerating vaccine evaluation, could reduce global burden coronavirus-related mortality morbidity. Volunteers studies could autonomously authorize risks themselves, net risk could acceptable participants comprise healthy young adults, relatively low risk serious disease following natural infection, high baseline risk natural infection, trial receive frequent monitoring and, following infection, best available £33.6 million UK government investment, first-of-its-kind study virus involve ***establishing smallest amount virus needed cause infection, give doctors greater understanding Covid-19 help support pandemic response aiding vaccine treatment development.***  many decades, human challenge studies performed safely played important roles accelerating development treatments diseases including malaria, typhoid, cholera, norovirus flu.*** trials also helped researchers establish possible vaccine likely succeed phase 3 clinical trials would follow, usually involving thousands volunteers. Ok 63.09% Good them. Hopefully states follow suit. Sounds like science fiction me. don’t really see could happen. can’t 100% certain though. public policy equivalent taking 70% antibiotics stopping ""feel better now"". pointed negative consequences poorer countries result euros buying vaccines India met immediate downvoting. China afford vaccine diplomacy managed contain covid-19 risk pretty much nonexistent inside borders. West can't since overrun covid-19 needs vaccinate first. geopolitical consequences felt long time. companies priorized USA UK Yup. Government vs Unions. get lot people getting vaccines still think little early end mask mandates Mask wearing likely needed past next months safe. fortunately, crazy people mad that. really necessary use autism pejorative? Yeah say, include J&amp;J makes unvaccinated dick even harder. It’s odd. I’m arrogant enough think know everything. disagree people things? Absolutely, understand coming (on things). people sit bubble think nothing outside could ever right just......I don’t even know word.

Focus analogy interaction Extremely unlikely, much essentially nil. I'm actually even 100 percent sure possible. ""Only one observational study directly analyzed impact mask use community COVID-19 transmission. study looked reduction secondary transmission SARS-CoV-2 Beijing households face mask use (10). found face masks 79% effective preventing transmission, used household members prior symptoms occurring. study look relative risk different types mask.""

This result real life data. That's it, unless I'm missing something would like point out.

You continue ignore real world data. excuse Kansas? California? Norway?

If clear correlation mask mandates overall deaths per million, think there'd several studies list determine mask mandate helping. would argue 85% cases unaffected mask mandates. even masks 80% effective (which likely practice), could reduce case death count 12%, maybe?

The point, again, mandated masks little effect end result point. Honestly large gatherings aren’t even biggest issue it’s specifically large gatherings side typical group. interact 10 people interact it’s big issue.

Shut bars restaurants sit dining, move curb side only, put rent break don’t go thing weeks minimal damage. 

But ever reason people lose dang minds forced eat favorite restaurant’s food dinner table instead someone else’s volunteered help distribute vaccinations PA, definitely wont actually giving vaccines, helping things.
If please volunteer, help much needed PA.

If live South Central PA, volunteer here: Texas: 2/3 months? Fuck that, time reopen now!  Can’t believe finally back normal Texas! I’m brought tears! mask mandate 100% capacity! Downvote want best news I’ve heard since last year. nose always starts running wear mask hour! What's about? mean that's idea no? Yep. dad died February Covid-19. even zoom funeral, 12 minute recording generic religious eulogy given graveside.

I'd planned drive visit July vaccinated, Connecticut bumped back vaccine list (it's based age, need, last Monday. Unless childcare k-12 education). People 2 age brackets saying earliest available appointments May.

So yeah, I'd like go back normal. idea happen. Anal pass. Bro, look around you. People openly defiant Covid regulations. arguments make sense. EU regulator approved age groups. 

What countries know overall regulator didn't? thought still unnecessary travel, social distancing, family visits, etc used made way invent class people don’t exist want lockdowns also don’t exist go forever. CDC said spike protein mutations affect virus' ""antigenic profile"". added ""may affect ability antibodies generated previous natural infection vaccination recognize neutralize virus"".

Health officials say ""possible"" vaccines may less effective it, work needed establish whether case.

So actually unknown, saying 100% certain clear here. changed? system changed. food industry changed. started pumping sugar HFCS everything

Really can't stated enough. lost 57 pounds 6 months keto, even really healthily.

Cutting carbs basically translated looking calories things thinking it.

Sugar EVERYTHING days.  Ohh see. thought speaking someone might get better results you’re right. able check availability online overnight hours makes sense. pay medical care would financial freedom. took forever get 3 year old wear one. finally get Paw patrol PJ mask masks. He's pretty good wearing one stores now. Also wife vaccinate planning going europe August know plane still enforce masks want conditioned wear one get kicked off. Sweden. I’m New York I’ll wear one happily take one else around. 

Last summer fall, eating popsicle walked past restaurant outdoor diners. One lady shouted “good job protecting chin! Moron!” Real wtf moment eating mask off. eating popsicle move really different? need one...going nuts seeing ominous predictions next Winter sending edge. Everyone take much needed breaks. Whatever going happen going happen suffer before...like me. 😩 think proved point. think misinformation? pretend convergent evolution isn’t happening mutations emerge again? 

The Novavax AZ trial results placebo groups good, showing previous case covid offer immunity SA variant. 

Then Manaus Brazil reached herd immunity, last summer, still huge spike variant emerged. 

Now NY variant E484k mutation. live US 18 year old feel lucky gotten first shot yesterday got second dose Wednesday would never gotten told arm would still hurting last vulnerable person getting first dose today- he’s twice age. Younger healthier people, people previously infected may okay one dose vulnerable. I.e. people options get fat.

So question legislators is: dare take option away dwell wildly unpopular style paternalism? part, answer no, though see token gestures like limiting soda size, somewhat effective measures like restricting cooked school cafeterias.

But Mom Dad stock cupboard fatty snacks give hoot, heck they'll bag Doritos Timmy (one bag each), there's much government practically help. 

Education personal accountability practical avenues get people eating right. may resonate perfectly individual level, work time population level. Well US country banned exports could argue unreasonable. Feel like biggest advantage nothing does, opponent is... Seems like forecasting/""race"" vaccines variants/infections. Americans never going *this* year

What bunch horseshit. arbitrary time-line Americans handle not.  Cause Florida Texas much trouble right right? Covid never going away, btw mean mono known long post viral sequele. brother mono HS bedridden almost year like fucking vegetable surgery remove one lymphnodes became size golf ball. Thats get angry people claim post viral sequele anxiety PTSD. No, not. People post viral sequele incredibly physically sick immune systems blown out, leading various awful symptoms. read often news mean never happens. go anywhere want country, states still quarantine requirements enforced varying degrees success. decision made pretend happening last year isn’t happening one devalues human life. valued human life would found courage put fingers ears “lalala can’t hear you.” Same. I'm used point, really bother all. (admittedly stupid) thing bother lipsticks going expired gross time wear lol. agree last point also. fully intend masking flu season rolls back around, time think might sick. courteous thing do, seems kind crazy never before. link provided shows majority named scientist article support idea asymptomatic people source transmission.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lol what? Yeah, seems like rollout greatly varies state. Glad family luck! overweight people included original study? Like, think sample would include too... gain weight. looks like obesity list. USAID already distributing covid supplies. I'd imagine they'll start distributing vaccines get enough US covered. Source? It’s never going “fully over”. It’s also never fully over. whole time taking stress hospitals. soon consistently taking load hospitals need open back up. Flattening curve never reaching herd immunity anything even close it. Good idiots act like zero idea something true study quiet. I’m trying provide context people don’t understand America willing allow infections provide individuals stronger protection. 

We particularly collectivist culture, lot people would say don’t want be. Right wrong. 

I don’t think harsh cultures Africa elsewhere seem particularly interested cooperating “greater good” either. I’d say marginalized Americans might better able understand people harder cultures face people live places social safety nets. 

I mean, get sick took watered vaccine, probably won’t able pay medical bills. Bill collectors won’t care took lesser vaccine “the greater good.” 😂 know girlfriend. Incorrect Yes premium like $200 monthly compared $8000. I'm confused. dogwhistle posted? Doctors know recommend get covid vaccine even already virus get focused 'Worldometer'. know everyone likes look numbers tables entirely reliant many, many different ways countries choose measure report Covid stats. hardly rigorous tool comparison. Lol. Willing go bar hopping, concerned friend’s health. don’t drop pamphlet temperance too? Assuming you’re young enough go bar hopping, friends much risk Covid driving bar (before they’ve drink). Jesus Christ wish could trust municipality lifts mask mandate, would mean actually safe wear mask. 

Indoor dining open since last May varying degrees risky whole time.  I'll paying attention CDC Fauci handful epidemiologists online presences I've come trust. presence absence local restrictions proven meaningless comes assessing risk.  true. AZ given ages Yeah, mean think part deaths still really high. 1k/day terrible. start staying triple digits, think narrative might change. course, media going keep hyping stuff clicks... would ignore news sources AP/Reuters/NPR/BBC while, helping lot baseline anxiety lol ""Have tried addicted heroin?"" read erotic got confused made trillions want want it. want to. I'm going wedding end May too. no, best idea get married late 30s 40s children. statistic that? Everything I've read said people thyroid issues conditions preventing losing weight far really good way put it. Maybe.

But 30% Israel noticeable all. assume personal experience Cobra sooo much expensive. Even sanitation-conscious person, admit person really sweat, rarely wiped machines. Nooooo can't reopen im scared waaah 

Ha ha reopen machine go brrrr That’s nice dear. thankfully isn’t you. Except fact likelihood catching disease **does** increase based amount time exposed someone virus. pulled ass, would assume that's real relevant part discussion would focus that. number, totally pull ass, illustrate point exactly accurate source me. Feel free disregard examples, point stays same. Things getting better. Take technology break least news break help lot. goal, maybe. long term debilitating conditions well. silent pandemic people disabled quality life severely impacted infection kill, least normal sense.

How many injuries suffer person practically dead? anyone point articles studies back up? 
I’ve seen type message repeated couple times, never huge backing data detail. 
I’ll remain cautiously optimistic hope good news keeps coming in. You’re exactly right every time hear people commenting want years research trust vaccine proves they’ve done zero research vaccine developed. exactly mean ""lockdown/shutdown insanity?"" Countries actually carried effective lockdown strategy, like New Zealand, faring much, much better rest us, particularly us idiot Americans made political slapfight screeched ""freedom"" get haircut. They're free make own. screw neighbors renovate kitchen neglect renovate theirs. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Here, there's almost actual informational value article. Thank you!!! feels wrong I'm glad agree. r/1918pandemic exist, deleted way back mid 19th century. Young people last vaccinated, wait longer simply go bar enjoy movie?

If vaccinations go age ladder, yes - turn means bars movies open young people vaccinated, crush.

If free all, venues reopen many people chance get vaccinated yet... expect plenty fake vaccination passports people buying way head UK cinema exec also mentions something like implemented theaters may opt open all, foster welcoming environment.

That's problem. problem half population vaccine yet, reopen half can't make profit. I'm getting first dose tomorrow expect to! lung condition, I've pretty much stuck inside year. happier seems like pace pick gradually time, U.S. starts running demand issues months, point millions doses available export. said Canada getting handouts? Depends country. mask compliance high.

No would shit street. know plenty people it. lived countries it’s daily occurrence. got second Sinopharm dose yesterday, shots side effects. One colleague got Pfizer, another one AZ, latter one knocked two days several side effects, intense work two days. I'm 24 degree history. r/captmonkey basically says think issue; COVID killed millions virtually everyone Earth felt mentally emotionally. Even 9/11, cuban missile crisis etc. things majority worlds population could go day normally afterward. virus mutated vaccine available. What's point? really amazing Merck completley lost Vaccine race play second fiddle.


see: Well federal government wasting time telling cities states they’re reopening quickly. 

That seems like odd thing respond wasn’t taking place. Yet again, sub really excited see fat people die. johnson seem like trustworthy company looking lawsuits. agree public health issue. officials saying lose weight want get ready contract COVID?

Needing social interaction means healthy functional human being. let anyone convince otherwise. I'm big nightlife person I'd like drink chill. I'm hoping sporting events back open we'll see. first time touristy shit, eating food, exploring Got first shot Moderna morning! Time party??? know obvious, apparently idiots facebook stats department imperial college london understand first thing epidemiology. understand though ,. that's something Humans control over,. right? (global catastrophes). 

During 1920's dust bowl... nobody could say:.. ""Damn.. dust bowl really inconvenient,. MAKE STOP !""

During Black Plaque.. say:.. ""This really inconvenient !""... ""have sacraficed awful lot ""

But dead. likely spent weeks ICU Ventilator?.. 

 end say 'okay, lockdowns ending now' open.""

The virus care realities try ""declare"". laugh face keep trying infect kill you. 

Nobody wants lockdown. realize certain things need done fight way this. inconvenience like ""not getting tickets favorite bands next concert"". global catastrophe millions people dying. (presumably) want stay alive. want whatever help people around stay alive too. stopped going gym, people DISGUSTING, majority wipe equipment using it, believed using towel enough, ugh, threw mouth remembering. It’s US company. Germany no-one blame lagging vaccine roll (and possibly Macron extent) No. T2 combination genetics environment. should. got last dose Wednesday. caregivers kids like eligible healthcare providers. don’t take daughter therapy day go clinic- take day- I’m sure would qualify healthcare provider. LA Orange County mostly trial participants, 65+, healthcare workers, volunteers fully vaccinated point. literally excuse lockdowns continue point; unless tyrannical overreach takes priority public health. Yes, ideally face shield pair glasses. Protect yourself, don’t expect others you. get argument all. media reports something less probable is?

I think Covid accelerated lot changes already starting happen. job fully remote FOREVER never plan going back office. I'm moving Tennessee (of places) know lot people coming me. 

I'm extremely interested seeing remote culture starts change American society ""normalcy"" returns. Well look pretty dumb sources link provide tons laboratory-based reference studies. None “anecdotal”, provide actual data controlled studies lab settings assess long stays various environments may address specific mechanisms transmission. review article linked. said one study completely false. cares get vaccine? want Covid it. Hopefully get antibodies protect thins anti-vaxx herd. Cruel point seriously cares. really sure democratic government ordering around citizens without consent governed. Famotidine? Hello? like going whole episode investigating peasants acid reflux China then... Nothing! alternative let happen? see Fauci anytime last year telling people lose pounds scared getting sick considering cardiovascular risks virus. Especially mental physical health effects people last year, encouraging people get shape ever year Keep going everyone, we're almost there! continue go gym matter reddit tells me

I somehow doubt meaningful number redditors demanded stop going gym. can't imagine anyone would care. saying priests lack moral compass? applying brush that, example, bigots say black people, Muslims. obviously never Cumbernauld... would depend age, location, theatre. point decrying Orwellian nightmare fucking idiots. you... Taste grandma? article: lived 1918 Spanish flu age 2, seen World Wars civil rights movement, married three times three sons, six grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren 11 great-great grandchildren. She’s battled heart failure, lung infection COVID-19.

... Yes I'm aware thank you, mean say food addiction simple cure like see people diminishing is. true addiction. infection rate higher rest country..... Could worse, could cubicle job never closed nobody wears mask :/ ask know Even better reason put fuckers jail.

Is best response?

You respond ""if punish criminals might get angry criminal, punish them?""

Or missing something response? mean, nothing socioeconomic status—100% healthcare-related jobs high demand. cares Archdiocese thinks. Vatican Pope endorses vaccines. I've traveling domestically (distance marriage) since June 2020 issues.  Food deserts ability access food, ability access healthy foods fruits, vegetables, varieties nutritious food affordable prices relation area's income level. 

Local grocery stores considered food retailer. super market. Local food gardens farmer's markets also provide ability access nutritious foods. Restaurants convenience stores count generally limited variety foods constitute healthy diet. 

The mile distinction people live cities address low income families likely less transportation methods. yes, 1 mile far travel. However, food availability becomes lot limited walking groceries 1+ miles option. Facts. UK second lockdown november, ended tier system end december near lockdown situation entered third lockdown early january. november-december lockdown avoid explosion january Boris decided third lockdown. That’s think. Yes Really? scientific method making testing predictions within given parameters. astrophysicist reasonably assert UNLESS XYZ, sun definitely rise tomorrow. you’re getting at? what? people dying covid? people die covid covid. USAID front CIA. Maybe still create goodwill desperately poor countries, that's really hope for. worked categorically saying long hauling due anxiety PTSD without evidence there's plenty evidence post viral sequele **not** mental health issues frankly never been.

I categorically say anything sort - said could potentially attribute milder lingering COVID symptoms psychological factors mild fatigue, headaches etc fairly commonplace. taken run away interpreting saying long haul symptoms caused anxiety. research confirming post viral sequele anxiety?

There's little good, controlled/non-counfounded research long COVID all, there's way assess much self reported symptoms fact related past COVID diagnosis - statement made people might attribute milder symptoms months long COVID we're sure that's case. We'll know much months - said yourself, budgets really allocated treatment study long COVID. also odd willing completely dismiss mental health aspects COVID potential impact anxiety. incredibly unlikely people 10+ symptoms, previously young healthy, sick bedridden, sick due anxiety PSTD.

Again, one talking people 10+ symptoms you. people obviously long COVID. arguing yourself. I'm talking narrow subset people mild everyday symptoms weeks COVID attribute long COVID without doctor's diagnosis, rightly wrongly. I'll let know ever happens. Man go 20 pairs gloves day. That's know over. read article? least get national holiday remind us shit future, hopefully keep us letting guard long (though guess we’ve barely guard is)? us Ohio, first “lockdown” started, appropriately enough, Friday 13th. vote call holiday “Quaranteenth”. don’t know fuck actually mark occasion don’t go work drink day. reading news? Tons people getting g vaccinated every day supply increasing. Yes. vaccines supposed do. Even I'm still going wear mask try work home much possible. commute means I've sleep past year ever remember. I've spent much less gas car insurance savings skyrocketed. I've driven 1000km since June! gotten sick basically year, love it! admit I’ve gone restaurants times soon open nobody else there. sick cutting hair though. Huh considered essential/frontline employees? That's pretty inexplicable. DPA used PPE starting last year. What's worse - someone getting money get people desperately need money getting anything ? current state unemployment systems barely manage is, would want put bunch additional barriers place? 

If anything, set aside money follow-up investigations enforcement. that, invest system suck. Agreed. far, message been, get vaccine change nothing. anti viral want focus allergy (it insanely inconvenient) agree wholeheartedly you. really excited vaccine able take though absolutely mind waiting. Israel still many cases then? vaccinated far world 94.88% population, reported 4151 new cases yesterday. gives?

Why UK seeing much better results Israel? UK 31% population vaccinated. Also true, hoarding vaccine themselves. Seriously bullshit. want people start shooting. Agree. And...a segment America (and world) keep new behavior patterns. 

Things like:

Shopping online / many things delivered (or pick up). Everyday goods (and food) delivered, leaving time things want shop person

Remote Work - takes small percentage (single digits) move big cities (and many already have) impact (not huge, still impact) economies, voting, traffic, etc.

Entertainment - many people renovated homes last year, bought bigger TVs, sound systems, etc. still go movies, selective

That said, optimistic finally see end coming safe. Yes, always around (we eradicate it) able go someone's house worry inside 2-3 hours group friends lead Aunt Tilly dying.  Yeah know shithole states possible unvaccinated careless thinking risk getting lower since many others vaccinated? handled everything far continuebto kid gloves. People lie vaccinated order wear mask. 

Same reason originally told masks work (to limit panic buying stockpiling). T2 environmental **and** genetic. 

Eating *large quantities* cheap food choice. I’m hoping that’s feel variants. Put name list anyways. chaos setting up, folks missing appointments get first dose, vaccine short shelf life. Give vaccination sites call see leftovers day see get one. get first dose, automatically get appt second.

Plus nothing, hear taking volunteers trained administer vaccine, get part program. Contacts vary place place. 

All I'm saying options explore. want vaccine (and IMO, want it), pretty good chance get put effort. creeped Catholics priests want tell what's morally correct? cells really prevent infection, plays major role reducing disease severity. research basically saying even people likely get infected new variants despite vaccine protection (and still big if) would still get mild courses illness. still think government absolutely choice shut entire province down, think plenty options. Instead spending billion's benefits jobless people, put ltc homes. example: ltc home staff tested every two weeks, increase budget test more, week more! That's gonna make bigger difference. I'm saying real risk either way. Maybe resistant variant arise among unvaccinated once-infected moved slowly methodically stem spread.

It's tempting frame values choice saving thousands lives versus guarding potential global risk millions. values choice get weigh in, great that? I'm sure calculation we're facing. know. Facts boring. would encourage people get vaccine? necessarily agree mask, saying get vaccine surprise. think that's say? interpreted it.

Anyway whether vaccinated people spread virus probably going moot point summer everyone wants get vaccinated get individual protection, thing people going care lowering health risks, eliminating COVID transmissions. people care COVID transmissions right bunch people access protective vaccines yet. didn’t. job indulge someone else’s crazy. That’s job family, friends therapists. 

Alternatively, stay home terrified going beach. media / journalists want divide get clicks. It’s sad. Bahaha fought important fight entire lives, burden fate world backs, surrender life style choices chill home watching netflix combination genetics environment, exist vacuums Less people get vaccinated quickly longer takes get back normal life.

Simple that.  hard get started sure, ones mental health gotten worse getting shape. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mean? variant already exists, already present Europe, proven escapes natural immunity AZ vaccination.

It exists small numbers better sequencing means targeted easier. dominant looking like dominant European country. know reinjected evidence suggest protected severe illness. T-Cell response affected varinats.

Vaccines never fully stop transmission country unless SA variant becomes transmissible current dominant strain, significant impact all. Especially next months, vaccines made adapt new variants. hope neck heals. Congrats losing 40 lbs. it’s lot. Acceptance mean encouraging endorsing unhealthy lifestyle man. means stop shaming/judging people recognize could well factors beyond control led path.

By encouraging stigma, perpetuate negative stereotypes exacerbate whatever mental health issues overweight/obese persons may already experiencing. science agree payments different entities... pay body shop fix car would count towards car insurance premiums? Exactly thought. people personally know work home said feel awful people can't would never ass know expensive delivery is.

It seems like another attempt stereotype entire group people promote anger divisiveness. kind generalizing shitty people group part effing prevalent today. many spheres. fact often question whether person making statements even legit.

There documentary watched people working propaganda factories promoting divisiveness misinformation surprised bs pushed online took hold started repeated regular people. 

We stay skeptical personal accounts emotional statements read online. Well maybe we’re Mexico’s largest trading partner. Something like - put maskless jail. 

When jail, inoculate them. Let sit cell two weeks.

Problem solved. That's fair, also work remote wear much. course assume I'd get used wear day, every day (and feel bad friends work retail do). went small vacation beach October, since crowds. still pretty warm felt DISGUSTING wearing mask everywhere, ended keeping hotel room. I'm amazed Moderna Pfizer able pump many vaccines considering that.. variant buzzwords everywhere 21 year old highly likely mild case anyways. vaccine probably ensures either prevent it, 0 symptoms barely know it. Well switching high carb protein definitely good way cut calories suffer severe hunger know extent impact words have? dismissing something authority dismiss. I'm mostly talking mental health Coupled brief quarantine - shitstorm could finished June. coincide claim California's economy stagnant. fact, tax revenues suggest large portion businesses thriving. pretty wrong here.

Well, minus definition. food desert section city easy access grocery store, generally defined grocery within mile (because many studies found people willing walk mile necessities. reason cause serious medical harm, many city planners want fix problem, food deserts impoverished areas access reliable transportation less ubiquitous, often areas rely small corner stores/groceries large portion nutritional needs, stores generally carry small selection foods majority pre-prepped nonparishable items, fruits almost vegetables. Real talk, deal family members genuinely think like this?

You log Facebook stop talking them. really solution, per se, I've away FB nine months I've never happier. F that. preventing hospitalizations deaths still. That's matters. give bigger dose, leave others without doses result. data looking Israel? 

8,100 daily cases early Jan, 3,500

83k active cases Jan, 38k

Peak 77 daily deaths Jan, 21 daily think hard predict public do. totalitarian society everything monitored everyone best other. Experts also want wrong cautious. Hell I'm little pissed Fauci said masks help start pandemic instead saying ""Masks help safety healthcare workers need keep n-95 medical people"". use kn94 masks type mask cut pandemic. would truthful inspire trust integrity. approved - remember? ""experimental"".

they emergency use authorization, fully might direct attention government got around constitution comes rights sex offenders? There's problem ever treating individuals rights long good whole.

whataboutism

you still get Source humidity big factor? Even case, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, South Carolina, Mississippi worse Florida death basis well. want see week's numbers pan make assessment near term someone hearing impaired, feel same. I’m mask whatnot live day panic attack speak someone public can’t read lips. I’ve literally doctors write piece paper communicate would otherwise fine. that’s OAN Newsmax told me. :o Anyone know whats Israel, according [this vaccinated nearly 95% population?

I reading wrong, vaccinating many people?

[If true, bigger question is, new cases dropped nearly US great vaccines. hopefully everything fine! Record shattering vaccination numbers Tuesday 1m first doses. Last Tuesday 400k  problem CA (and states) governor really direct control local school districts design.

So really offer bribes them.  French German supplies shipped immediately! idea behind lick stick, though, able ship months worth, whatever, people's homes, test way door, results recent possible, cheap done often enough mitigate false negatives. less person person benefit masses. huge benefit would reducing lost productive days, helping economy survive bit better. Every scientist engineer tell 10000% earth spherical; orbits sun; viruses mix genetic material membrane; plenty things. many questions, like efficacy vaccine, likelihood see Betelgeuse go supernova, etc., really cannot answered absolutes simply don’t know — make guesses lack empirical evidence clear law nature help us predict outcome high degree confidence. super close Right- subtracted incorrectly- correcting original Questioning good, don’t tone know better. It’s nothing though. proper mask massive improvement. You’re literally blocking two direct paths lungs half mucus membrains reason vaccine got door fast studies would usually inform guidance. Anything point best guess, scientists going err side caution. Nah original comment was. let know subpar way. know RNA MMA. But, left? Donated??, going happen. Thank God. Yep, acknowledge that’s good point. Thanks bringing up.

It might fine substantial surge due UK variant due higher R number, happens next weeks vaccinations plus natural immunity able curb case numbers overall. someone wants lie status risk life, that's them, legally morally.

except ***can't*** ""lie"" 

faking entry database much difficult simply saying ""I'm vaccinated""

&amp;#x200B;

**How Ticketmaster Plans Check Vaccine Status Concerts: Ticketmaster **digital ticket app, third party health information companies like CLEAR Health Pass IBM's Digital Health Pass** testing vaccine distribution providers like Labcorp CVS Minute Clinic.

&amp;#x200B;

they're using little pieces paper, either

**Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle working digital vaccination coalition health tech companies, includes Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle, working initiative aims make easier people access COVID-19 vaccination records digitally. people beginning get vaccinated COVID-19, may need prove they’re vaccinated return work, school, travel, easily accessible digital vaccination record could help that. coalition calling [Vaccination Credential Initiative can't book plane ticket, hotel, travel re-open borders without quarantine restart aviation governments need confident effectively mitigating risk importing COVID-19. ***This means accurate information passengers’ COVID-19 health someone lies tells they've vaccinated actually come party, care?

all matters hospitals get busy - know put back lockdown. Probably liked comment reddit history. understand people want go back normal completely honest understand anyone comfortable so. I've spent vast majority past year home I'm getting ready spend next year home too. I'm afraid second let guard I'm gonna get possibly spread family. wear kn95 pick postmates. sanitize packages opening them. wash hands point completely drying out. I'm still terrified covid I'm even high risk anything. buying vaccines standards. individual countries choice using vaccines passed ""emergency approval"" want to. Yeah, religion thing me. Maybe I'm wrong here, seems stable get married right children ideally higher chance parents present child's life. Sorry reading that. man. saved lives past year appreciate awesome life pandemic. I’m never taking granted again. Even 50% good since deaths infections halved 7 day average doses US 1,942,788. close 2 million... aspirations much simpler. want get point I'm worried walking store taking life hands, I'm weighing competing risks going dentist versus getting sick. still get it. 

Take care. would nice quantified risk another wave. Like 10% chance 90% chance. It’s speculation anyway, least it’s expert speculation. I'm guessing concept money time involved getting enormous machine Broadway show live. fringe scientists saying fall fully resume pre-pandemic activities fall, vast majority taking much cautious approach. spectrum activities resume, Broadway extremely cautious end. Rehearsals take months new shows, expect actors crew return work ""herd immunity""? Even returning shows need lot time prep, cast changes. really hard compare COVID approaches results across states. many variables. instance, heat humidity Florida suppress virus way skews Florida's status outlook? Factor age demographics differences, political differences, etc becomes even harder.

&amp;#x200B;

Edited replace ""countries"" ""states"" problem enough might reach enough uptake herd immunity actually 1.7 million. means 7 day average right around 1.94 million. They’re trying scare people preemptively letting guard down. ignore stay cautious you’re vaccinated. It’s rube fodder. Nah, they're cherry picking. That's tone whole time. no, 1st wave peaked august kinda still 2nd wave rising form end november Started reading again, caught plenty movies television, learned cook bake well, took care bit overall. Thanks putting positivity dark time many! lost compared newly introduced mRNA vaccine (that openly still learned medical community worship) mechanic changing flat tire lmfao humidity FL plays big factor cutting spread. claim fine long case numbers fall bit hasty? that. 

We total R less 1 variants, still R 1 B117. case spike unless anything changes. saying covid hysteria doesnt cause harm? covid response caused catastrophic damage. Maybe worth it, thats debate. like one side harmless. extent fears overblown cost/benefits distorted, harm done. Maybe think extent 0, thats pretty extreme position think. Wow. available public summer rate. anyone walk get vaccine (my guess early summer late spring), you’ll see numbers drop even more. That’s sweet spot things return normal. 

These vaccines rolling super fast people 1B. think Florida also reports data residents. snow birds New York aren’t counting metrics excerpt:

 independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) met Feb. 25, 2021 second planned interim analysis trial data determined convalescent plasma intervention caused harm, unlikely benefit group patients. meeting, DSMB recommended National Heart, Lung, Blood Institute (NHLBI), part NIH, stop enrolling new patients study. NHLBI immediately. think one reason mutations. unvaccinated people travel freely maximizing opportunities covid mutate create deadly versions potentially. stay home country may able stamp covid good. Like SARS. feel like ton states never eased eased already lol. sun protons move relate matter extremely predictable ways subject laws physics, chemistry, etc. “variables” around sun rising pretty limited either black swan-type events future phases stellar evolution humans may even survive see. yeah, sun “may” get hit GRB accelerates disturbs stable fusion ultimately leads end solar system.

The variables around vaccine viruses predictable. unforeseen mutations butterfly effect play yield many strange permutations. “may” context — widespread vaccination may eliminate COVID-19 entirely — subject much likely possibilities GRB hitting sun (or earth). simply don’t even know variables, don’t know next mutation look like, affect people, on. 

TLDR: scientific “mays” same. It’s kinda true. Add 35-40% naturally acquired immunity vaccine rates don’t need sky high dramatically reduce spread. Still doesn’t mean shouldn’t get jab, part benefit vaccines even unvaccinated get protection Looks like cases trending downwards again. ~12,000 new cases far US today it’s almost 2pm. honestly think kinds things - erratic arbitrary restrictions, constant goalpost moving seems intended perpetuate lockdowns indefinitely - fueling conspiracy theories. actions leaders make absolutely sense can't justified logical explanation, anyone surprised people start wonder might hidden agenda going on? 70 years, state's foreign policy decided Covid.

I expect sole thing, think future COVID pandemics play much larger role foreign domestic policy **every** state. would expect spending pandemics would much larger today. used hypothetical scale asteroid hitting earth. something taken seriously, let alone serious enough devote significant resources fighting it. Everyone knows cost lives economic impact pandemic modern world. real threat countries working stop fundamentally led paradigm shifts. Covid hasn't. framework ""normal"" changed. fall soviet union invention hydrogen bomb Chinese civil war definitely longer effects covid.

I disagree. world part Soviet Union immediate sphere influence, much impact daily life (same Chinese Civil War). Yeah, Cold War tension, fall Soviet Union change much western world. change people worked, obtained food, educated children, interacted friends family. COVID done everyone everywhere.

Yes, Eastern bloc state, Soviet Union fell, huge. random person Kansas, interesting thing saw news went day like normal. COVID effected everyone everything. think going change world works together, control people moving across borders, see emerging health crises states threat safety.

Once large, developed nations vaccinate people, they're going working foreign governments vaccinate populations well. good cure US UK dangerous variants arise less developed country threaten put us back pandemic. would huge blowback spending billions foreign health past, expect contentious going forward.

It's going change people work, people view education, perception illness used fine go workplace clearly ill send sick child school seen bad thing. think we're going see big lasting changes result it. No, may big individual directly effected things mentioned, they're going large lasting changes world works whole.

In short, might change single person's life much things specific people, going change everyone's life little. makes huge historical event. something talked generations come. got first dose vaccine Sunday night, I'm ready second dose two weeks. know vaccination stops people spreading yet? remember science certain yet, theorized vaccinated could longer contagious. wonder people getting vaccinated we'll find out. I'm trying figure get parent's shots I'm even sure system working. ...I making general comment vaccine rollout, found relevant mention one three vaccines US approved teens 16+. knew Pfizer, didn’t think relevant name it. Careful, might reinforce belief he's life party. say ""hey guys, hold three months party time. keep mask closet might...might...need next winter. however, think memorial day we're less done this. we'll play winter year spring 2022 almost certainly rearview mirror.""  everybody bark moon, frothing mouth crazy people board. [come show dog! Yes, eating 400 calories worth chips going **sustain** long 400 calories almonds.

Sustain wrong word. Satiate word looking for. 400 calories anything (ignoring energy takes break varying macros) sustain amount time.

As rest. I'm really sure conversation currently is, implication eat irrelevant obesity ridiculous.

I think people fat lack understanding calories work. think liking calorie dense foods. knowledge, time and/or inclination prepare tasty healthy meals. probably levels understand Cheeseburgers French fries soda get fat lettuce carrots help lose weight. can't/don't apply life myriad reasons.  Nurse here.. ya get used lol note Vaccine hunter facebook groups. predictably lot confused people much real advice.

This experience shown technology savvy 70+ crowd is. really struggling technology aspects here.

My advice anyone help parents book appointment. 10 min efficient google use/phone blitz found appointment folks previously ""couldn't find anything."" I'm MN though could different IL. Honestly home store person store I’ve gone pandemic wasn’t need based. They’re damn big. cubic footage air airflow high may well outside.

I still wore kn95 avoided aisles people stopped though Forget Kansas look study linked went ""it's influenza"" over. cite several studies several countries US support assertion mask requirements (or least high mask use) prevents infections deaths. would hope passports become thing vast majority population vaccinated. Essentially wait one month vaccine appointment slots start staying open.

Anything else mean next pandemic even Covid variant get little buy younger people. Since atm vaccine proven prevent transmission, basically saying ""let boomers go little risk serious illness themselves"" concept applied younger people. US two weeks, although done slowed things down. large percentage people followed guidelines that’s we’ve paying price. 

I don’t recall saying herd immunity. arguing it, seen inconsistencies top people, especially know got way. kidding. worked restaurants, hardly anyone washed hands bringing dirty glasses plates dish. walked right line grab freshly plated food bring tables.... embarrassing lmao I’m person internet, qualified make conclusion data.

I agree premise though. say that, r/The_Mueller still exists. got 205 165 today.

40 pounds lot weight lose one day. Iam 5 days tested positive COVID it’s important document discuss analyse record COVID happens understand better prepared future far touch wood wouldn’t anyone.  want show small children life outside daycare, home, park :(

They even remember grocery store is. Covid around 100 years, you’d wearing mask rest life standard. think masks stop required every adult offered vaccine time immunity take effect. fade get used seeing people become comfortable. highly doubt you’ll see mask commonly 2022 outside specific medical facilities nursing homes. French government make available everyone. What's going ? Hey guys, remember Game Thrones? Neither I. majority exotic country still unvaccinated, wouldn’t matter go long I’m vaccinated right? Well yeah. It’s kids go back school August go July go all. Yeah, take $$$$$ months plan, everyone backing risk averse. 

But restrictions put place gov need GONE theoretically possible vaccinated person get infected despite vaccine protection, enough antibodies prevent symptoms, still enough viral replication infectious others. case studies actually happened, based know immunology, cases quite rare - would expect vaccines cut person's odds infecting another person 90%, possibly closer 99%. two people fully vaccinated, safe other, one vaccinated, might want precautions (meet outdoors, distanced, and/or masked etc) depending risk factors involved. people want protected be. Yes, people can't get vaccinated extreme scenario, vaccine work all, that's reason us put life shredder. yes, slapping masks every basketball game pee wee pros fundamental quality life shift that's unacceptable. deleted really care lol Awesome news, CA! LA County really went recently. I’m glad breathing room. 20% adult population US received least one dose. [emergency use treat criminals horribly, give us free pass even people. criminals stupid people people rights, including right take vaccine that's technically experimental see sub first thought meant bunch Gloomy Guses. Wow, saying mental health improves fitness shape hot take now? Ever hear endorphins? Get rid pants too!! Australia aimed elimination; modelling predicts viral suppression relies behavioural change response restrictions gatherings, behaviour change occurs majority population, never achieve elimination suppression, hospitals exceed capacity excess death rate skyrocket

It’s probably true “medium” compliance, ie, empathetic conscientious follow rules, authority enforcing them, unlikely large reduction cases; leader going ethically say “well, lot die, you’re worth it”. Oh actually yeah guess monsters said 

Unfortunately guarantees either, places done mostly effective lockdowns like Singapore suddenly failed lifted quickly without proper management, definitely element randomness mutations America share anti vaxxers, surprisingly less anti-vax European nations. 25% Americans said they’d decline Covid vaccine, vs 45% French example. freakin nuts either country high get feeling, enjoyed deal lots people increased flexibility around remote work stuff.

Also, probably wear mask rest life I’m passing enclosed space lots people (airport, etc.). haven’t gotten much sniffle last 12 months, kinda like that. seen. work isolated rural hospital district 20k people. meat plant oil refinery vaccinated + weve vaccinated healthcare workers, nursing home + thousands residents.

We went multiple deaths week, full ICU overflowing COVID inpatient outpatient census requiring state staffing intervention literally one day everything stopped. weird. seeing nothing. like someone flipped switch. even slowdown.

This vaccine. Picture it: Game 7 NBA Finals. young unvaccinated African American strolls gate ready game friend gave ticket. white ticket taker tells he's denied entry he's undesirable.  fun that... literally false dichotomy limited n95 masks. recommend piece cloth soon knew would effective well. people might loved ones. might different stance then.



Nice close another emotional argument though. extended family member pass covid. It'll another 10 years work Trader Joe’s. issues talking people start. I’ve adjusted talk louder. Might emotive ways like eyes hands. don’t know. hasn’t issue while. LETS GOOOOO *2 weeks slow spread.
*just get vaccine
*just hit herd immunity.
Next probably going every american vaccinated. make clear danger unless elderly multiple pre existing health conditions.”

This accurate.

Yes, groups higher risk (generally speaking).

But CANNOT (and NOT) use “generalized statistics” try predict INDIVIDUAL outcomes. Thats massive mistake. like saying:.. “Well, people skydive dont die, dont need take safety precautions double check chute.”

The reality is,.. (still) dont yet accurate way predict severe mild Corona infection person person. vary wildly based dozens different individualized variables (some still dont even fully understand). 

Using mindset “Well, I’m young,.. irresponsible carefree want!”...is playing russian roulette life, also lives people around (since know infected 4 14 days ans spreading even know it).  

Wutang aint nothing fuck with. 

Corona Virus aint norhing fuck x 10000000. know put history books, Canada WW1 WW2. might us covid war though. keep mind virus technically defined SARS-CoV-2, disease known covid-19. kind like HIV virus resulting disease AIDS. point virologists know level viral activity needed exhibit symptoms. still know certainty full vaccinations completely protected infection, end asymptomatic carriers. gets tricky vaccines lower efficacy like J&amp;J's. who've taken shot may still get infected symptoms, mild cold-like/allergy-like symptoms. Whether they're still contagious mild infections big unknown. Unfortunately, there's silver bullet therapy covid yet, can't experiment infecting ppl live virii, observational studies takes months involves literally hundreds thousands ppl. Holy shit, dude unhinged. Ten bucks says Vanessa barely knows political can't trust tagged ""good news""?

Twitter arbiter constitutes misinformation good news. something like ""Lockdowns work, Florida got right"" misinformation? Seems like one man's opinion, see prompting ban. don’t know “ viral interference “ . article suggests social isolation played key role.  vaccine passports controlling? anything less controlling least option travel stay home. vaccine passports roll we're completely tied mean, some, agree. really confirmation highly suspected feature, always nice see documented proper controls. LOVE series may die, likely (HOPEFULLY) show r/all anymore. God, hate type comment. spend amount time worrying ""signaling"" mask wearing? folks keep time want touch face, even mind much easier leave on. Others high-risk live high-risk individuals feel safer leaving on. difference make you?

Personally, like pull mine I'm outside safely away people, that's personal choice. would mind others choose keep wearing it? I'd rather people wear necessarily need to, people wear should. It’s year “two weeks flatten curve!” It’s time. still getting it. said 5 times understand masks effective limiting spread Covid-19 individually given moment time.

Again, point study cited listed counties Kansas implemented mask mandates counties not. Counties implemented *performed worse average* terms deaths per million. *say* important try limit smaller vectors spread, measurable benefit population, would you?

If county requires masks 1000 people per million die, county B require 1000 people per million die, matter ""the studies"" show masks effective? Real world data shows long term effect. Dude I’ve agreed possibilities there. What’s issue? don’t want enroll kids trial fine. want wait vaccinations results? whatever. something get you’re kids chances getting really sick small. Yes, it’s big deal think every child parent. Isn’t nice know parents relieved chances getting really sick Covid almost non existent statistically. 

You take chances time. I’m sure drive careful could get accident. Things happen. 

Also cherry picking parts statement opposed reading whole kinda shitty. There’s chance it’s minimal. telling /r/apocalympics2016 isn’t active sub? Nope, missing anything. ""the news"" spread misinformation covid vaccines may prevent spread. Unrelated article, hot dog place nathan you? people know like guinea pigs. Would test vaccine 50% efficacy? 75%? Vaccines rarely 100% effective preventing illness contagiousness. doesn’t mean large reduction illness contagiousness doesn’t effectively end pandemic either way. vaccinated person spread it, rarely, drops reproduction values stops spread viewed community level. individual level could still spread. thought America third world shithole imploding covid? Don’t deserve them? agree 100% however there’s difference informed- you’re advocating- crafting headlines solely generate panic clicks. It’s scroll deeper articles you’ll often find admissions things likely continue trend positively spite variants. Again, doesn’t generate quite clicks/concern many vaccines kind illness stop spread? Fact is, news surprising, all. also de facto reality elsewhere. Amarillo, Texas freely vaccinating anyone walks door token effort enforce state-imposed restrictions. county official charge said ""we turning anyone away.""

And bet Amarillo's place like that. want take daughter places. Museums Balboa Park, walk around Parts San Diego. Visit sets grandparents freely. course listen. 

Hooooooly shit imagine believing Since deleted comment below.

I believe mentioned anything regarding cost.

I'm saying eating ""healthy"" foods, calorie counts take care themselves.

You said almost much eating rather eating.

Like kind either or. eat almost completely irrelevant conversation.

 eating bunch fresh fruits veggies, plant based proteins, whole grains, ""how much eat"" part take care itself.


What eat matters. evolution humans incredibly strong urge eat much eating wrong things. bodies adapt calorie bombs people still feel urge eat.

I guess I'm saying Calorie counting far easier consuming right stuff rather McDonald's. Surez theoretically, lose weight McDonald's, people requires insane power it. Kids die nearly rate, seem transmit adults. Hence CDC says teachers go back work. bet run marathons 3 phds perfect self improvement always pays off, hey benefit knowing perform tracheotemy know happening variants starting dominate kids expected go schools class closed 3 cases confirmed. joke  job require talking? Communication takes decent hit masks. work hospital elderly it’s almost impossible communicating them. masks dampen sound can’t read lips. Can’t wait mandatory masks go away forever.

Pretty sure Reddit figured obesity issue country. move now. take experimental vaccine

It's approved - remember? ""experimental"".

And might direct attention government got around constitution comes rights sex offenders? There's problem ever treating individuals rights long good whole. Yay!!! honestly dont care one is. 

I trying understand use name first place. use phrase ""one of"" indeed know one was. working export feature."" went sub searched ""USA"" first relevant covid article comment. first one honestly feel bad folks states right get wrong, plenty problems Canada, know majority Americans good people deserve way better this. Fuckin a, right? Trump even get deal purchase enough vaccine manufacturer. literally throw money something make purchase, inept/lazy/incompetent/evil even that.

Good fucking riddance! know that, prematurely jump conclusions. reason obese people would need vaccine bodies bigger relationship vaccine volume, immune system weaker obese people experiencing constant inflammation renders vulnerable diseases. bigger organs

I think high lung surface area directly causes heavier viral infection either, make sense. logic could even say skinnier people would problems higher percentage longues would get infected amount virions, would lead lower oxygen saturation blood. case mention body shaming aspect - despicable. Another report in. Water wet AstraZeneca well Pfizer trials, since reported much better data real world, recent data England Scotland indicate AstraZeneca works well better Pfizer. 

 “Today Public Health England (PHE) submitted pre-print real-world study shows Pfizer Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines highly effective reducing COVID-19 infections among older people aged 70 years over. **Since January, protection symptomatic COVID, 4 weeks first dose, ranged 57 61% one dose Pfizer 60 73% Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.**” COVID-19 disease, SARS-CoV-2 virus. exposed significant viral load get disease/effects, virus might still able replicate low levels, even fighting off.

I think they're saying ""can someone successfully fighting virus shed enough viral particles cause infection others?"". know evidence (casually), unlikely. immunity less sterilizing still dramatically reduced viral reproduction shedding, would make less contagious even protected forcefield zaps viruses sky.  makes mad comic con E3 got canceled again. Yeah man I'm disgusted treatment obesity nation. number one cause death IIRC really seems like one right solution take care it. gained like 15-20 pounds (I 195 6'0) last summer started felt absolutely disgusting. clue people live 250-300+ I’m thinking could fourth wave it’ll nowhere near serious anything experienced last year, vaccines horizon hospitals knowing treat thing. think conspiracy. think corporate CEOs get together plan things out. think situation we're today happened purpose. think culture evolved things work. They're independently works best them, way water flows downhill. there's big mystical reason they're it. money, pure simple. money, afraid losing access it.

Let's take universal healthcare, instance. whole industry based health insurance. idea happen industry implement universal healthcare. Probably nothing good. whole point universal healthcare get rid profit happening doctors hospitals patients. 

But insurance industry suffer. employers stand lose huge advantage employer-employee balance, here. Right now, employers one viable way average Joe get healthcare. many many workers leave jobs retire early pursue something independent rely employers provide health insurance.

So course people profiting way healthcare works today want universal healthcare. lobby politicians (and ""lobby"", mean spend vast amounts wealth on) keep universal healthcare option. politicians motivated make constituents think universal healthcare bad. also spend money influence news stories make universal healthcare sound bad. fund studies publish ones make universal healthcare sound bad.

This far cry vaccines causing autism mind control. There's clear motivation, here, clear path got here. big part Citizens' United, bill allowed corporations ""speak"" money - i.e. legalized corporate bribery. work hospital. think masks might stay. ""*Go covet thyself!*"" absolutely get it, I’m guilty myself. doesn’t mean it’s toxic AF  Great, stop kidnapping shipments countries? np. still recommended wait 2 weeks 2nd shot though. Id hold licking doorknobs bit last job had, left start thing, told first day three vacation days first year expected use them. Fun times. Ok, pharmacies can’t help all.

That don’t vaccinate anyone go government run facilities get flu shot every year.

You literally don’t know you’re talking about. I’ll say 50% capacity limit right now. maybe weeks so, bump 75%, even reopen fully. best becomes annual nuisance manage yearly shots, like flu. 

I believe currently testing trials 16+.

They difficulties finding younger volunteers apparently. use blow dart vaccine method? comment suggesting policy science **are** guided u/dawk1001's feels? much trust vaccine, legally can't force people take experimental vaccine. vaccine still considered experimental. suggesting perform human experiments criminals moment. thing ain't leaving soon Depends state course.

DC continue prioritize inoculating America (the American general public citizens) else exporting homegrown, domestically produced American-made vaccines made USA countries U.S. reached herd immunity. Maybe I’m optimistic, don’t think so. Assuming vaccines continue roll out, track start opening more. don’t recall experts ever saying “just 2-3 months” past. longer spread virus remains uncontrolled higher odds variant pop current generation vaccines work on. unfortunately, yes... remains large portion population refuses get vaccinated put us risk. Ahh ok. mistake. happen know current transmission rate is? find it? would verify okay even mix vaccines. havent heard word okay point that’s false dichotomy. concern N95s surgical masks, buy like government already tell everyone else wear piece cloth least. don’t sacrifice one group people another easiest solution tell truth. don’t think we’ll ever agree I’m bowing out.

It'd suck use valuable doses find 4 months reduced efficacy whatever reason. think I've read covid antibodies stay present body 7-9(?) months, people caught twice. can't google verify I'm work.

In end matter, I'm gonna continue mask distance 2022 probably. wish we'd adopt masking regular practice even things like cold. Japan Asian countries really part right. US plenty water  yes, news story. already knew reduces spread lot heard yesterday Gavin Newsom offering $2billion school districts re-open?

If true, man long strange trip CA. strictest, draconian, even vengeful lockdowns (Orange County beaches etc.) - offering billions please re-open. first many!

Some locations Georgia started vaccinating teachers, even though officially open next Monday. also ""caregiver"" option, requires almost proof broad definition, know folks using get early placement. Honestly, that's fine me, given we've already taken care risk citizens (elderly healthcare workers). 1. person reddit saying mean things mean want let die preventable disease

2. Americans say horrible shit countries social media time

3. I'm pretty sure small minority people say stuff like that. people rightly criticize America's covid response, call Americans subhuman realize 500k us dead, variants gaining steam, people Florida, live, still like nothing happening? Businesses 100% Get Americans inoculated spring achieve herd immunity midsummer, early Autumn 2021 (this fall) September, finally win pre-corona lifestyles back. sure like making things up.

The term ‘food desert’ much zero access food, normally used describe situation easiest prevalent food junk food balanced, healthy options uncommon. doesn’t mean people never take bus supermarket outside neighborhood, means accessible options sufficient build balanced/healthy diet around.

Infrastructure majority US cities largely based owning car. option besides traveling car underfunded reliable option. Recognizing limitations people face accessing nutritious foods allows communities address lack resources. past year world basically completely shat US's Covid-19 response

As American, yes really literally calling Americans ignorant subhuman fucks.

Um what? get idea? I've never seen anything like buy two dozen pack eggs pounds lean chicken less $10. price thing, education thing. like every state country, even ones lock residents house Could fat ass zero side effects either dose besides sore arm like hour? fraud carry 30 year sentences. Isn’t kinda point? I'm simple man. want go outside without mental fatigue might catch virus. Japan filled people culturally Japanese. filled Japan Spaniards Americans would catastrophic. must incredibly difficult. hope vaccine roll improves. Lol I’ve Cumbernauld. Stayed Moodisburn hotel - revamp.

It lovey! 😂😂 absolutely problem. let virus rage worldwide, sure get mutations render vaccine less effective eventually. Meaning potential another pandemic event think in-line destigmizing movements like destigmitizing mental health issues addiction issues. goal shun shame people problems exacerbate issues. also important decouple value physical looks, especially young women unconscious prejudice permeates society. 

The good part body acceptance movement letting people know value worth despite current physical attributes. sometimes misinterpreted encouraging people stay unhealthy. But, using addiction analogy, addicts far better message: ""We love you. see illness want get better,"" message: ""You worthless useless society would rather disappear."" teen girl hear ""We love you. weight define you."" important message since ads, movies popular culture gestalt says exact opposite.

Unfortunately like complex issues, loudest stupidest people often biggest say public receives them. Yes, going need high percentage people take effects want. look Israel still without significant decline cases hospitalizations. think going happen US example. California crushing vaccine rollout. We're almost there, hang tight. equally responsible? Sure. Never said would jerk folks wearing mask. also confront people wearing mask. Would love people wore em, moment, power enforce that. sub became hated calorie dense cheap things readily available

Yeah exactly, that's point. People spend hours commuting struggle make ends meet (not necessarily, large chunk Americans) gonna go cheapest, convenient option way society structured makes difficult anything else. vaccines much longer period shots. Shingrix, example, requires second dose given long six months first. Doses close together COVID vaccines trials condensed. second corroborating study talks individual effectiveness masks influenza - think needed said study bearing **population effectiveness mask mandates** Covid-19.

To reiterate main point seem like I'm saying masks work - individually, worn properly, clear masks work. point really much data supporting *overarching government mask mandates* much effect. seems conflicting right? essence, everything comes Covid spread - *vast majority* spread occurs prolonged close contact someone virus. People prolonged close contact mostly *without masks*. effectively utilize masks, wearing *in homes*.

Wearing mask grocery store decreases chance catching Covid small amount compared people house. mandating masks grocery store small effect overall spread Covid (again, counties mask mandates Kansas averaged 51st 105 deaths per million) people going meet maskless people's houses anyways. Thank you. Yeah one talking ""controlling"" others, weird defensive take. people trying justify ignoring public health recommendations automatically jump saying others trying control them? victims behavior judged negatively. I'm saying think risk assessment unwise leads unsafe behavior overall harms community, locked prison. free unsafe things rest us free judge them. like people free park rusty car lawn (ignoring HOAs) neighbors think trashy. Yes that's it. I'm reading ""lower percentage most"" ""perfectly safe""

I'll wait numbers studies like everyone else.

My kid even close school age, would nice hire nanny wife full-time jobs, trust SUPER antivaxx county live (think eastern michigan) dumb adults. NO! stay locked least another two years! *is* new normal. Stay home watch Netflix!

**/s** point vaccine? UK (where article from) Az Pfizer rolled fairly obvious that's vaccines they're talking says much article itself.  American apple pie. Interpret way want. Less 15% population vaccinated. Local Houston news on. medical people interviewed saying time. one nailed cross on. want romantacize staying home, watching Netflix getting high sort virtuous behavior, guest. r/Coronavirus dying soon, i'm ears. Fucking asshole. point let Texas leave. Better hope vaccine given enough new variant emerges vaccine won’t work  hope there's enough J&amp;J vaccine go around, that's one family wants, Pfizer Moderna. Greg Abbott: ""Hold beer."" “How live without fertility” it, COVID flu. COVID still mortality levels way worse flu current levels infection. levels right would still mortality rates way higher flu season outside Spanish flu. Hell, drunk driving kills way fewer people. Yet reason cool stopping people that. Why? wearing mask personal choice driving car drunk? save way lives masks right preventing drunk driving. nation 500,000 deaths essentially 1 year full spread. Drunk driving deaths 10,000 year. Even COVID stayed current infection levels deaths would hundreds thousands masks saving way 10,000. “Living it” means wearing mask closing businesses things get back. past year exactly asked last spring. mean know states/cities institute curfews riots summer. I'm pretty sure California also enforced covid curfews know comes 9pm ""science"" walgreens Texas great luck 4 pacific time. constantly monitoring cases/hospitalizations/deaths decision made based numbers. 

THOSE NUMBERS BASED CURRENT RESTRICTIONS.

Honestly, people think like reactionary morons can't predict weather 10 minutes now. Went bowling alley bars Brooklyn last weekend. Bowling alley completely packed. Bars packed definitely tables filled. says cannot upload link twice.  went 3,000 deaths day 2,000 deaths day two weeks, another two weeks 1,000 deaths day. elderly risk vaccinated deaths almost nonexistent. rate April. idea still locked June ridiculous. fourth wave coming vaccines keep going pace. data indicates open more? quarantine 72 hours, it’s useless. virus 2 week incubation period, meaning could test negative symptoms still spread 72 hours. 

And last time checked, Australia wasn’t wielding people homes like China was, unless believe appropriate? even bother groups point. Verify 40 year old used smoke year two 20 years ago. fourth surge possible... schools reopening fine... long done ""safely"" according guidelines... include anything opening window week... ""safely"" means expenses... damn stimulus bill passed yet... Biden gone record say teachers moved eligibility groups.

Before downvoting, actually think fourth surge overblown considering amount vaccine doses coming. I'm also one charge CDC talking sides mouth. 

My problem thinks might fourth surge, tell us people sitting room 4 5 hours day breathing air ""safe"" significantly contribute 4th surge. primary route transmission aerosol.

I know, know... kids spread it. come high school town several outbreaks primarily among kids sports together? come parents coaches got it? 

We've enough time pay real studies never did. I'm basically like F 4th surge, reopening happening gonna take blame one. simply even wanna hear anymore reasons why. Nothing serious. Felt bit tired went sleep super early. little headache arm hurts quite bit. Much less expected. 100% pulling distract energy infrastructure failure Texas. Yeehaw get 1st shot tomorrow! dude forget Great Lakes exist something? significant portion Earth's unfrozen supply fresh water right here. Mental health wellbeing wise really need people vaccinated like 4th July. Two months normal summer outside like maybe airports whatever.

Even June, man. I'll mask June need-be. let's good July. need start getting news reliable sources. guarantee one kind expertise infectious disease told would vaccine widely available. find difficult believe, year worse worse news. diverse American city terms people, diverse city terms viral strains too. No.  Run early morning avoid people. mean. They'll deal they'll die. So... vaccine get? got Pfizer dose 1 yesterday felt dull pain morning, symptoms. really want feel comfortable around new people again! vaccines people dying recovering holidays us better place. people don’t want drink drive won’t. Everyone’s happy! /s public doesn’t understand cautious language scientists use rule. scientist saying “we don’t yet know” gets translated “it probably doesn’t work.” distributed number mean shipped arrived? argument hold much water things calm down.

They still get vaccinated, turning surveillance state cannot end goal anti vaxxers idiots. I’m going defend Cuomo think difference many deaths you’re densely populated early epicenter pandemic willfully causing deaths refuse listen science. 

Jersey, though.... friend told clubs open stuff, might combination both, reach number 1... people live nursing homes long term care facilities make well 1% US population, account 34-40% COVID deaths. die right away going quality life seriously diminished. 

People 75 8% US population, 59% Covid deaths. People 65-74 21%, people 65 80% Covid deaths. 


Vaccinating elderly (over 85) save 500X many lives people 20's 8,000 times many lives vaccinating children. 


If Covid even mortality rate, might make sense vaccinate youngest first, that's what's happening. surely hope right. articles purporting leading permademic reinfections defeated vaccines may baseless variants definitely mainstream news. love 40k know privates lowest lows high school) definitely believe vaccines, that's reality live studio. usually one somewhere. offend anyone me, even slimmer chance 3 kids age playing Mr. Potatohead gender identity crises.

Stop bullshit. bet HEB going let enforcement. probably officially allow masks people already wearing them. Polio also effectively eradicated. need foster work culture encouraged acceptable stay home sick.

One inescapable conclusion working home last year: anyone coming office obvious signs illness straight asshole. Anything office, home. trouble telling coworkers need leave sick. damn sure I’m coming feel unwell. read restrictions permits? arrive orange red zone, must quarantine: red, two weeks, orange, 72 hours test negative.

Currently, Australia effectively eradicated COVID, country progressed green, ready revert time. (For example, Auckland currently red - lockdown - due _single case_ detected there.)

Of course, we're weeds here. original statement New Zealand Australia level lockdowns China did

And clearly did, mandatory quarantines, severe restrictions public life, end result effectively _eradicating COVID-19_. strategy worked. usually eat steak do, cook myself.
 
Yeah, steak something I'd get delivered foods stay heated fine. one knows anything viruses telling would vaccine widely available. think people need understand; people say Florida way while, people respond still bit compliance Florida, it’s PROBABLY GONNA END LIKE TOO. like Florida, case probably going everywhere urban centers full normal, cities masks sometimes. Like Florida. According cdc vaccines prevent symptoms possibly hospitalization death. prevent transmission. could true? Yeah idfk what's going there. Obviously faired much better countries like US Brazil. country literally nothing stop spread. Kept students schools workers office. Waged domestic travel subsidy campaigns blaming spread foreigner populations (""this pen"" isolating tracing foreigners). shit testing response. think ""they wear masks"" ""they're healthy"" completely explain [elderly population almost zero impact.

Per [this 2020 deaths Japan decreased 13,851 compared 2019. last time saw decrease annual deaths 2009, saw 547 fewer deaths compared 2008. *insane* nearly unexplainable decrease compared years. Also, say excess deaths Japan down, even though ourworldindata shows [12 percentage point excess deaths Japan 2020-2021.

Obviously Japan good way telling whole story. Honestly, feel elated right now, really starting hit light end tunnel.

It’s like cargo cult. think trappings success successful. Like people built fake airport like bamboo stuff thought cargo planes would automatically start coming. thank swami...can also let know next gme is? “They got me,” Covid said American's vaccine effort. ""That fucking America boomed me.""

Covid added, “Their good,” repeating four times.

Covid said wanted add America list countries it'll avoid summer. H‑E‑B already rescinded once. They’ll sure Ready next pandemic.

First Bird flu case human? mean entire adult population fully vaccinated end may Exactly. Everyone it, never even thought it. pretty gross think about. French here, confirm totally unreported France. That's WAY better thought mean everyone vaccinated first dose (for two dose vaccines) April end, second dose May end? right here.

Even summer, this. need create extensive databases track this. Make people travelling internationally provide documentation, turn country surveillant state process. Twice postponed wedding schedule June. LET’S GO! already dude actually make joke handling ""arctic blast""? mean personally don’t judge people based state live in.

Texas officials looked data reasoned risk opening worth society  So, vaccination appointment Saturday, today someone close contact tested positive. still okay get vaccinated, potentially already Covid? mean, maybe? husband might daughter almost certainly won't. know highly likely get COVID normal situations, airplane bunch maskless bozos seems sketch. get there, doubts. see plays next months decide. Obviously cause “Texans mastered habits keep getting COVID.” (greg abbott) Fall?? Ahahahaha try July friend seem wise remove restriction half population even eligible vaccine.

Yes, we're talking now, we're talking summer adults access COVID vaccines. Congrats US. guys pretty good. Sometimes, gets forgotten noise.

This really well executed vaccine rollout. Given population size, hands best performance country vaccination effort. Less pressure Socal able outdoor dining It’ll matter people end hospitalized worse Texas couldn’t wait “immune vaccination” phase actually effect. past point necessary though, early pandemic yeah would huge, vaccine rolling arms something like 70m people unnecessary. Agree long isn’t super variant something seems vaccines still work enough variants another’s point politics go political things also made shit up. get outta here. got stats back take word? There’s big underselling vaccine going on. least US. messaging terrible. People told you’ll still need wear mask, you’ll still need distance, indoor activities still canceled, virus still spread, aren’t protected variants. take doesn’t change anything? public needs told vaccines medical miracle silver bullet kills pandemic. submission linking yahoo.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* looking forward hearing school shootings again... Depends symptoms. Coughing &amp; sneezing spreads virus further. issue masks always walk 100 feet away car remember need it, run back grab mask. Actually went grocery shopping 5 minutes day realized bunch people giving dirty looks, run back car. Also make glasses constantly fogged up, yah, fucking hate them. still wear them, hate them. We’ve math now!

This something new!

Connecticut stated 2 weeks ago everyone would able schedule appointment May 2nd Israel provides clinical data vaccinated Israelis exchange Biontech/Pfizer vaccines. Pfizer uses country like large-scale trial. 

Pfizer needs agreement one country arrangement. Thus, something countries could emulate even wanted to. Looking vaccines Florida 65+ parents counties near fully booked many counties appointments still available, little discerning since people want can’t access enough man power meet demand. Hoping they’ll look allocating based turn rate help get even vaccines arms Weakening immune systems shouldn’t encouraged Well I’m happy you, I’m sure huge weight shoulders. Thank getting done! 👊🏼 data age range, shit ton fact. makes 0 sense. might underestimating many people already it. 2.66M Texans confirmed it, however, CDC esimates 1 4.6 cases recorded. translates roughly 42% Texans it. However, people taking precautions likely change behavior likely under-represent 42%. Add 13% population vaccines, possible population people change behavior near herd immunity. much actions impacts others yet seen. ok cool whats exit plan? variants forever present. old folks assess risk themselves. 

we gotta outside also highly effective flu vaccine. like soccer player getting 15 feet open net, instead kicking goal punches ref fucking face. 

We're goddamned close. wait solid population vaccinated (like 60%+ whatever math says cause R drop 1).

Otherwise we're going get world's worst submission /r/Prematurecelebration  think really matter sweat, leave dead cells stuff :| executive order also removes ability local authorities impose mask mandate. Abbott's order said: ""Individuals strongly encouraged wear face coverings nose mouth wherever feasible maintain six feet social distancing another person household, person may required jurisdiction wear mandate wearing face covering."" good damn new day. Lower cases, vaccines production, much better projection availability. done-zo folks. worry, right it’s opinions everybody scale optimism. Funny thing is, I’m usually accused pessimistic. Upvoted ""nuts butts""!

First heard expression getting line haircuts boot camp. Usually DI said ""assholes belly buttons"", hear multiple times per day 3 months.  Yeah, cancelled august trip last year, first doses we're starting plans year. mean shutdowns made people loose livelyhoods, forced abusive situations, forced miss cancer screenings *aren’t* irreversible damage? People get therapy eventually over. Obviously /s

Anyone who’s supported supported measures taken past year cannot say care heath.

Doesn’t change fact places weren’t overrun though. shut down? 33, I’m you. get us, don’t care give it. In-store, drive-thru, blow dart. shoot me! Oh please, canada taking advantage us since WW2. There's strong reason never bigger ally let's say Spain. important get people vaccinated soon possible. Yes!! really sobering actually face reality risk deadly virus. stark contrast Instagram Barbie life. Yeah, I'm super confused people live can't things.

I bit extreme situation seen friends year. I'm taking care mother finished chemotherapy extremely high risk... live New York City. Without car.

To go see friends, friends over, they'd take subway, huge vector infection. Short buying car chauffeuring everyone around, simple act getting fro presented huge risk family. close contact today? let's say makes way America around August everyone fully vaccinated. Essentially would level immunity variant regular ill-fitting surgical mask (the infected without mask) original COVID? math correct? 100 more? 1,000 more? 100,000 more?

When restrictions lifted? COVID goes zero? thought joking... see true. glad left Texas. fear idiots infect &lt;16 year old kids nations highest Flu deaths per capita. Doubt  quarantining? go plenty stuff. going trigger redditors lol God hope so...my biggest wish want graduation ceremony instead stupid slideshow. Idc it’s outside, past 4 years degree brutal Can't picky  I'm looking drive get jab.  39 time reach cohort I'm thinking that's like. “super variant” scientific term? example “super variant” virus recorded somewhere? think going schedule day 2nd case. way surprise rush cover work short notice. yeah, would fine adults got vaccine anti-vaxxers, still cautious kids can't get vaccinated yet disagree you, I'm saying think ""normal"" many people school-aged children still participating society. many kids day-to-day life notice, work lot people kids lot friends kids, many expressed sentiment, life feel normal still see :). Sure did, whole concept ""flatten curve"" temporary restrictions keep hospitals overwhelemed. later turned lockdowns vaccine.

Edit: fauci April Fauci warned leaders careful quickly loosen restrictions. “We still put foot accelerator comes mitigation physical separation,” said. Asked things “back normal” summer, Fauci said hopes that’s case. “I’m cautiously optimistic we’re going start seeing turn around curve flattening, coming down.”

Notice, clearly saying ""until vaccine"" know from, state Minnesota says expect enough doses everyone summer hope.  I’m calling 4th July we’ll open things back again.

Though, think Memorial Day states already opened things back up,  “Things don’t match world view perfectly! must everyone elseeeeeeee!!!!” Mississippi checking in:

A great deal people stopped wearing mask month ago. People care anymore.

I've phizer shots I'm vaccinated. people die face long term side effects would acted responsibly kept mandate That's Misinformation. 

It’s though. Please show randomly controlled study proves masks work prevent Covid-19. Don’t worry I’ll wait. That’s say don’t think masks work, point time properly sourced evidence do. know. people realize mask mandate kind meaningless? 15 states already one including almost rest southeast. grocery stores likely still mask policy while, that's changing. people wore mask probably still weren't, wearing one anyways. used different title time.

Used exact translation title time. made clarification Netherlands, clear title. Oh, problem choose wear mask not. calculated decision. concerned part comment quoted, part calculation relating rather wear mask partially relates statistic asking about. congratulations 🍾 It’s almost like can’t really predict “pandemic” things well🧐 Texas: *cough cough* okay July guess I’m clinical trial moderna vaccine truth nobody really knows vaccine hits people harder others. like don’t understand virus hits people harder others. Everyone’s different. know situation specifically, could issues last mile distribution. Maybe that's hint masks work well think do. Improper fit, dirty masks, touching face, etc.  shitty solution, encouraged masks encouraged social distancing obviously better tactic hoping mask catches big droplets Shhh, apparently reality triggering follow ""science"" crowd.

You lectured number deaths told dont care lives point types facts. putting words people's mouths.

He said COULD mental aspect long covid, post viral fatigue syndrome real thing seen multiple viruses, including SARS It’s damn time open that’s forsure. Anyone scared immunocompromised still able stay home use new services became available past year. Right, would lifting mandate prevent places business requiring store, office, etc? US increases 1000 fold vaccinate entire population 4 days! Where? Can't fix stupid. Wasn’t Asia Europe even confirmed case??? say except challenges lawsuits navigate. Lol irony know vaccines makers able say stops spread, due time constraints get vaccine record time. see reason think prevents infection, also stop spreading it. Apart messed vaccines, like attenuated polio vaccine once, people vaccinated spread diseases. 

And lastly seen studies Israel seem show infections going since vaccination. that's real world trials right there. goal flatten curve. Texas flattened curve seems unlikely hospitals overrun point, I'm guessing reasoning behind getting rid mandate.

The thing flattening curve curve unflatten (as saw curve flatten Texas July peaks low Sept, followed recent peak mid Jan year). Sure vaccines mitigate that, today there's ~7% vaccinated, even throw ~10% covid recovered. leaves 80% (likely lower, still 2/3rds) population today, would risk infection. wonder Osterholm alarmed ""hurricane cases"" prediction coming true.

Almost people start listening experts constantly wrong. medically illiterate. People finishing courses antibiotics reason antibiotic resistant bacteria exist. Please, please read viruses bacteria evolve. point don’t know ceiling looks like. nearly doubled pipe dream expectations end month day #2. I'm sure, point, choose vaccinated 3 vaccines damn near 100% preventing hospitalizations, that's fault Unfortunately parents carry much weight school funding tied attendance strong financial incentive individual districts follow state lead. compound things personally small rural community likely minority dissent. problem wearing mask. I'm undecided still continue wear next week, still going whole lot I'm vaccinated. know posted but... vaccines *every* American end MAY. Instead JULY.

HOOOOOOOOLYYYYYY FUCKKKKKKK  makes sense. Even there's large number people long term symptoms Covid nothing anxiety, there's probably number people chronic anxiety and/or depression manifested physical forms, even exacerbated covid symptoms. There's nothing wrong acknowledging mental health plays role physical health (things like cortisol levels, inflamation, fatigue, etc). dismiss anxiety, even large segment, certainly lot people immense amounts strain, bound least part due mental stress.  One thing sure, beginning see restrictions lifted coming months whether people like not. It’s coincidence Texas ending restrictions March 10, almost exactly year since lockdowns started. Republican-governed states follow quick succession, soon moderate Democratic ones too. expect NY Cali last ones, likely summertime. beginning end restrictions society adjust quickly. months away masking social distancing becoming personal choice. Miss Biden... please arm right I’m ready can't really see Arab Spring one top events even within 2000s.  
At point Arab Spring almost forgotten already people close countries - much international attention see Syria getting now? countries always wars countries side world people would make show sympathy over; covid happened kind thing biggest kind international crisis around many people, I'd guess seems completely insignificant average person dealing pandemic another country.

It also even really lead many significant changes politically; revolutions Western media hyped ended shuffling around various dictators, certainly grand emergence Western democratic ideals taking like predicting.  every adult take one vaccine. always viruses circulating. headline editor weird definition ""all time"". agree you. quit gym it. don’t know “fitness culture” decided contracting virus smart, healthy choice, has. Unfortunately, that’s way Florida. 🤷‍♀️ Please don’t confuse facts. really hurts narrative.  kind doubt people dramatic really went much work/school first place. Mid April compromise date. End may would prefer. Based data readily available. Talk moronic. wife's Dallas ICU disagrees you. 50% covid cases ICU 40 last year. Yeah, Texas 30M people. 

There’s way decisions don’t bleed elsewhere. talking flu.

COVID longterm consequences flu. realize many states never put mask mandate place? It’s mostly local government controls this. AZ never put one place every city requires it. relax people, means little. Also, Iowa thing month ago numbers keep dropping mean biden direct every state prioritize teachers make sure every teacher least one dose end month get students back school.

Ohio went 50% students without option school less 10% now, Cleveland Metropolitian Schools fuck ton teachers vaccinate want get reopen. hell say plan able get students back classroom month.

The plan worked damn super well Ohio, even two months, hopefully least get students something year mask mandate “closing” “opening” state? suppose could some, legit could smell several months catching something fits nearly every description COVID Feb 2020. Spring breaaak! James Franco voice. senior high school learning entirely remotely since September, mental health absolutely horrible friends incredibly depressed. quite literally got worst senior year time; work play. It’s incredibly hard, school’s admin done 0 seniors nobody likes school anymore like us used to. I’m counting graduation can’t take anymore Ah.....so hard tell Reddit. Everyone flipping shit like matters whole lot. Florida even mask mandate cases went last two months like everyone else's did. Yes airports many federal properties.  going wreck Vegas September. 2 weeks WOULD worked everyone done it. virus literally can't spread isolated two weeks. 

Sometimes like republicans refuse acknowledge Australia New Zealand exist. mandate gave excuse “oh it’s me, wear this.”

Exactly... mandates gave people clear reason point without get silly arguments. Definitely considering Fauci said would necessary wear masks end year numerous times. issues people wear them, kill people. Remember people didn’t that? york...you can't hide packed hospitals media

You actually can. Filming hospitals HIPPA violation thats unflattering ""hospital footage"" rare. really hope come fruition last year every worst case fear has. They're choosing selfishness fuck country. Sure. People capable living large city millions others understand simple ask like wearing mask does, people live small places either don’t get don’t care. 

Honestly, people seen don’t wear mask grocery store red necks. Low education, high pride. Small town? Small town mentality? idea. stay away best can. people do. 🤷‍♀️ No. shit load people need plumber fix burst pipes. 

Source: Texan No, don’t think virus isn’t even remotely threatening vast majority population poses significantly higher risk respiratory disease mankind dealt with. population shoved DiGiorno pizzas mouth 6 times day wants start worrying health police normal people’s behavior. think reason Governor Abbott ended Texas mask mandate gave waiting clearer instructions Biden administration? mean, totally agree CDC clear metrics-based federal reopening guidelines now, but... I'm sure everything fine now, mean Texas awesome right? assume people going outside, partying, that, group actively seek vaccinations? 

I’m betting we’ll get spike. least states shitty COVID responses(Cough cough Texas cough cough) suspect fade pretty rapidly 50+% people vaccinated, isolated clusters popping up. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Turns right. Perhaps deaths hospitalizations decline.... mask mandate? atleast cheap gas electric..amirite I'll wager still virus circulating people refuse vaccine, completely safe. I'll feel hell lot better, sure. Well, far vaccines good variants.

What vaccine race - get enough people vaccinated fast enough variants emerging anymore? Removing mask mandate allows potential variants emerging. Stupid move.

""at one point society media fully understand Covid. therefore covid restrictions warnings time useless"" I'm sure said Fish man good! see people tired pandemic pretend there, it'll go away own. long people don’t flub it. I’m Alberta, we’re finally getting traction vaccine distribution, sure enough anti-maskers using fact we’ve covered maybe percentage point population proof enough lift restrictions immediately. Last couple days, they’ve even marching streets demanding end “lockdown” (even though we’re lockdown; businesses open simply capacity limits mask mandates). Meanwhile health minister says we’re still uncertain full return ordinary practices, UK variant still aggressive don’t nailed places it’s appearing; lots community spread obvious source control. lifted restrictions tomorrow like protestors want, we’d quickly become hotbed new strain far faster vaccinate it.

Long story short, don’t let people fuck up. Keep exercising patience wait metaphorical ship come harbor trying jump gap pier. remember British media picked 90%, EU fell AZ everyone angered quoting 70%. take sick day this? mean, technically sick even though it’s self induced.

We're year pandemic/restrictions hard decision make. regulatory authorities supposed make decisions based solid science, somehow balance general public need. little data available age group make actual scientific decision. However, public need clearly there.

Fucking revolt oafs. comments he's made since Covid crisis started Abbott fucking wants people dead, throw ass out, run town goddamn pole. Lest forget he's fucking 'sacrifice old people economy' guy. There's bit lag doses administered reported CDC. Tuesdays ""reported"" numbers *roughly* correspond injections weekend. view daily administered count (instead daily doses reported) CDC's site Weekends always mean huge dip. No, dude, believe me, want much here, last week expecting waiting forever magically Thursday boat load appointments opened up. Currently optimistic. fucking dumb, shit ton data Scotland England number millions participants. show AZ extremely effective, even outperforms pfizer first weeks time needed get overall efficacy. money grabbing? one gains anything recommending things stay closed. Yeah, I'm super confused people live can't things. People complaining state can't anything, like...you go inside eat restaurant every single meal, go gym, go movies, go mall, go bowling, go get beer, literally anything else besides large gatherings like certain sporting events concerts. guess kind like go kitchen, plenty food, mood anything like, ""Uuugggghhh, there's nothing eat."" Masks continue recommended, per today's executive order, page Governor, counties area high hospitalizations defined **individuals strongly encouraged wear face coverings** nose and
mouth wherever feasible maintain six feet social distancing from
another person household, person may required by
any jurisdiction wear mandate wearing face covering. This! Hound Rite Aid similar websites. Bet gutted never got gestapo Ah, good know! sure. Hopefully public health officials actually study restrictions actually useful didn’t effect. one gives shit “stats.” Japan second highest median age world, course flu deaths higher US. Stop misleading IMO Biden administration announce state adhere CDC guidelines loses eligibility state &amp; local aid residents ineligible $1,400 stimulus check. Kentucky here, appointments getting snatched almost immediately. smart ass, purpose vaccine? locked hard enough beginning get with

It would gotten Didn’t mean scare you! Honestly, even reaction, goes away 100% within day two. went miserable lump hour 36 puttering around house like normal hour 38. took good night’s sleep feel right rain. Yes, probably done much hoping. MRNA vaccines use brand-new cutting-edge machines; there're world, people know run build them. Pfizer Moderna expanding production lines along, expect fast could. I'd surprised anything could've done there.

Now J&amp;J's vaccine much amenable that. Go register UPMC Rite Aid site. I'm 33 smoke qualify 1A make appointment one available. might think right due bad, bad messaging everywhere, true. Sure, Cuomo sucks. doesn’t change fact Noem probably headed spot 2024 ticket qualification leading constituents graves. Perhaps bit optimistic. friends also think big mistake, guess time tell.

The thing is, like people sudden go back normal. still lot people staying indoors, wearing masks, think really change much. people never took seriously, still taking seriously, either.  well, what's evidence happening then? Yeah done honest. start visiting parents without mask on. Since winter almost hang weeks going start outdoor gathering friends soon warms up. get vaccine start indoor gatherings friends.  Texas full-fledged sprinting crawl. Summer saw drop many states implemented mask mandates seeing initial surge trying reopen. Also, summer guarantee lower cases. France, cases surged late August September. cases per 1M US. Late August also problematic US rate decline new cases stalled. similar now. tail risk hospital overrun much slimmer, could easily isolated outbreaks. seem wise remove restriction half population even eligible vaccine. 60 days, everyone access vaccine. Yes, look them. China, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand etc. 🎉 Costco months away actually start reopen stuff safely.

The hope is, course, people actually last months without losing fucking minds. Private (non gov regulated) power grid first state go 100%. Thanks America’s guinea pigs, Texas. We’ll see goes. places WORST flu deahts per capita Earth are.....Japan Korea

Ok, that's much different previous statement ""places WORST flu deahts per capita Earth are.....Japan Korea""

You're place, man. think arguing sake arguing. Good luck bro understand variant emerges evades vaccines due recently vaccinated people getting infected giving virus chance adapt vaccines, would mean vaccines elderly people would offer protection variant? weeks ago, CDC says n95 masks short supply reserved medical professionals. Oh, going go them. There's enough entitled shitheads going show mask, waving around Gadsden flags refusing leave, since ""the governor said 100% open"" going worth headache. They're gonna signs up, they're going enforce it. According website says 13 minutes. sure include whole extraction process. would guess maybe around 2 hrs based know Panther get someone results 4 hours online says Panther takes 2.5 hours first results something like ID could potentially shaved couple hours. *Non expert extrapolation like invented term 'prime pump' Yeah really don’t know people likely scream “follow science” least likely looking quality evidence effect size masks real-life community settings Ah yes, inevitable Twitter shitstorm Texas news. One page replies I've already seen ""I'm Texan literally freaking out,"" ""we thank Texas extending awful pandemic putting innocent lives risk,"" oh, best all, joke, ""you mask pry cold dead hands.""

What fuck done people? Yea incorrect.
Please research Well see happens. cases go significant way I’ll curious see reaction goalposts get moved 
 again. Yea. tough unless person okay driving Meadowlands. Everyone knows Twitter accounts tricks losing teeth vaccine here.

No, they're tour happening June would already announced announce next weeks. 

There nearly many would think. people advocating full reopening today genuinely think restrictions going extended 2 3 months time 2045?

That's TSA Patriot Act 9/11. ""We attacked, need security time being""

It's 2021 dude. conditions qualify 1A, even I'm eligible smoker 33. frustrating people know this, bad messaging around, even trying even though qualify. Wow, selfish gramma-killer! /s [Here Executive Order. see exactly 'ollie ollie oxen free' time restrictions coming **in areas high hospitalization rates**. Seeing restrictions initially implemented keep hospital systems overwhelmed, one might argue logical step take. K, comment section become fat hate circlejerk comments locked. Stop oversimplifying obviously complex response. yet cases deaths steadily declining well month. Herd immunity isn’t nirvana. 
There different levels herd immunity. 
Coronaviruses cause reinfections 
When wake that? heard first-hand conservative family member would wear mask mandated. 


I actually conservative state mask mandate (finally) implemented last summer, went less 25% people wearing masks grocery store 100% overnight.

Most conservatives know works, needed government mandate don’t seem “weak” it. 

The mandate gave excuse “oh it’s me, *have* wear this.” posted comment 20 minutes Tweet Texas' actions cause ripple effect across south.

Alabama's mandate probably going extended.

Arkansas' 0% extended pretty much already said that.


I keep waiting Desantis (Florida's governor) take Georgia Texas' lead outright BAN local governments making mandates.

Once DeSantis I'd guess SC next.


In Midwest Indiana going first remove mandate. Ohio resist DeWine feeling pressure party I'd guess he'll follow Indiana shortly.

IL MI going resist awhile especially IL's economy shitter. IN, WI, MO eating lunch. selfish people resort personal attacks likely won't

fortunately, minority. also businesses/governments still right thing regardless selfish people want Ahh another variation gone summer.

How'd work last year? true, even though might feel like it. :) I'm Pittsburgh, mother-in-law 65, got shot due high-risk condition. Rite Aid accepts high-risk conditions. UPMC. go register sites keep checking (UPMC notify schedule you). Giant Eagle too. hospitals sticking strict restrictions, absolutely get 1A qualifying condition find appointment. 👏👏👏👏👏 number one rule covid guidelines nothing ever falsifiable Ya saw that.  live now, lived first 20 years life feel bad y'all. Oh see. empathy.

How go talk families lose people selfishness instead talking anti lockdown anti mask people. Talk kids lost year half schooling get shir together first 6 months. meant 'stop exponential rise hospitalisations'. Telling pollster Intend following actually 2 different things. mum got vaccination letter today actually danced back stairs joy. long, long, year we're getting there. Closer closer we're getting there. live heard anything sort? think allowing restaurants 100% (which change much many still follow 6' distancing, etc) opening stadiums 12% much. it, though? facts gave ""much higher,"" ""more easily,"" ""less."" think that's ""really apparent."" mean, one year older makes statements true. Age still #1 factor there's much concrete (I said concrete, already feel studies thrown me) evidence much actually affects someone. fact death rate low among young people, obese not. going wake call them.

Not trying bust balls, disagree going wake call anyone. majority die covid still going elderly immunocompromised.

Lastly, U.S. *has* wake call. They've many years. Look exercise equipment, gym, diet sales see America fully aware problem. aware solution, apparently. think true always encourage greater precaution. early official advice people wear masks encourage greater precaution. reason (a relative shortage PPE would needed medical professionals), nowhere near simple always encouraging greater precautions. agree, COVID circulating long first confirmed case, really know Italy first not.

Sorry, right I'm fair. can't really bothered look points, I'm honest. We've dealing COVID year, people feel way feel.

I appreciate discussion, giving proper discussion deserve. I'm honestly feeling quite elated gotten rid mask mandate, really feels like light end tunnel!  speaks broken society United States say shouldn’t ? would amazing!!! guarantee fully open, fully safe summer US single day proper lockdown though point moot. issue think production. issue logistics getting vaccines arms people gotten want them. Especially population vaccinated, finding someone list vaccinated going increasingly hard. barriers heads NYT headline today: U.S. Edging Toward Normal, *Alarming* Officials

You make shit lol resources go Anglosphere brown people India starve go without vaccines. things never change... Manaus, Brazil I'd optimistic. think vaccines light end tunnel, we're close quite yet.

Covid pernicious bugger, keeps surprising experts great ways. Scientists/epidemiologists make assumptions based coronaviruses act, however covid-19 keeps acting differently, make best guesses data supports rejects theories. lot countries gone pandemics already social customs wearing masks sick.

Also travel outsiders rare.

Take small African country ebola outbreaks recently.

They already become accustomed pandemic lifestyle. also receiving number travelers areas countries.

Now take California. Thousands coming state daily across US around world. Unfortunately Cleetus also freedom wear sneeze long didn’t die, won’t care. “Fuck you; got mine.” Lol country stupid Exactly. think biggest current failure regards covid - give us quantifiable metrics 100% this! Whether it’s based hospitalizations vaccine doses given (I think one state said first doses allocated reaches 70% population, done). close end, yet people limbo there’s quantifiable end sight restrictions bad. Yeah DeSantis banned local governments fining penalizing INDIVIDUAL. 

They still mandate toothless.

They still make mandates fine BUSINESSES though.

TX GA actually banned local governments making mandate all.

Well GA mandate LOCAL GOVERNMENT property.

But GA actual mandates outright banned Day 1. agree, think it’s good hear POTUS either way feels soon get rid mask mandates. get everyone wants full normal. too, really think need stick wearing masks 100 days goal Biden set end April. We’ll much better terms vaccines. soon think it’s really hard say. friend 42 little sore arm days. Another friend 60 felt like crap, fever, etc 3 days. wife’s boss started automatically scheduling post vaccination time people department several sick days it. really variable. 

However, common symptoms basic flu-like ones (fatigue, fever, feeling sore over, headache.) usually limited first 48-72 hours getting shot. Yes, could stronger reaction statistically you’re likely feel kinda crappy days ;) Congrats getting 2nd!! side effects? got shot 2 days ago last 2 days, especially Monday, f'd up. Nausea, headache, take s' every hour so, fever on. bout you?
Edit: clear things up: side effects started showing roughly 12 hours given shot. woke middle night drenched sweat head hurt like hell wouldnt say “swimming vaccines” atm. Yes many doses pipeline eligible people process still immensely challenging, slow, tedious requires hours monitoring appointment schedule systems online. find annoying, confusing convoluted im late 20’s tech savy person, imagine tech illiterate senior bumblefuck nowhere Nebraska challenging must be. I’d agree, close point crushing vaccines still 2 months i’d say people realistically get dose actually try... lot happen 2 months.  still laugh fact sub started, one rules politics, back assumed responding lethal pandemic could never partisan issue. Hoo boy, require readjustment course last year. Don’t forget big Gretch. 20K deaths brilliant nursing home decision somehow eludes every time it’s brought up. Gotcha understand reduced risk still risk. study peer reviewed data I’ll continue wear mask reasons then-
1. It’s big deal wear mask
2. want set example son
3. don’t want misinterpreted asshole. jealous Texas Wrong  place employment requires everyone wear masks within 10 feet anyone else, many people don’t follow correctly. ended paying nose full face respirator P100 filters last year give better chance, nobody seems care me. I’m sure I’ll continue wear months come still. think vaccinated people fast large part 55% dont immunity yet. also got hit super hard variant possibly could 20k cases without vaccine, hard tell early.

8,100 daily cases early Jan, 3,500

83k active cases Jan, 38k

Peak 77 daily deaths Jan, 21 daily comfort level anyone else's problem own. mean, that's nice, mentioning meaningless without action. Students need people feel bad hard time, need people help stop hard time. 76 year old dad 0 issues az.  Lol enough fear mongering. It’s  Maybe. countries likely problems sweets though. Arab country gonna several knafe places like dessert Mac n cheese pizza 

The point getting accurate info atm  “When you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better, might even block droplet. it’s providing perfect protection people think is. often, unintended consequences; people keep fiddling mask touching face. course [there could schmutz inside mask]. think mask, think healthcare providers people ill.”

- World’s top doctor, Anthony Fauci stupidity. reason wear mask right now. 2 weeks flatten curve, end it. fault questionable reading comprehension skills. Everyone work second shot pretty much week next. Honestly seems 50/50 far got effects got sick. zero side effects first one fever, wicked migraine, chills, exhaustion weird hyper skin sensitivity second one.

My work expected people possibly call though people schedule usual lol. Well bright side maybe Texas opening early put pressure officials pick pace vaccinating. know today highest Tuesday yet first doses, still barely 1 million 3 approved vaccines, that's 20,000 per state average. feels like way more. Maybe that's asking lot, asked us put life hold year.. that's asking lot. USA wealthiest nation earth. indebted nation. doses distributed, doses administered? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Remember folks. still freedom wear mask anyway. Shocker Exactly. That’s message isn’t resonating. isn’t “hold 2-3 months”  Phrases like lead people believe things less then. case many experts Twitter way. They’re rooting masks distancing mandates strictly enforced years. Good. Yeah, I'm wasting time bullshit strawmen. 

The person who's strawmanning arguments yourself. free continue, again, long make argument see irresponsible ill-founded, respond *You* one dismissed legitimate concerns want end restrictions merely selfish desires ""socialize."" thing.

You've appropriating delegitimizing people suffered people foregone precautions, want continue forego precautions reaching herd immunity. clearly shows really care people suffered pandemic willing appropriate suffering (physical, mental, etc) others rhetoric. that. one else pointed woefully out-of-touch business pretending understand plight trying pass judgment on, clearly struck nerve. 

Lol says person who's appropriating family's emotional financial situation pandemic. arguments continue appeal suffering others policy would actually exacerbate suffering - that's problem. 

That everyone problem people like mess progress that's made reach herd one else reading point, could give less shit change *your* mind.

Get better arguments fact *still* can't acknowledge possibility someone might honest, well-intentioned disagreement policy sensible - you, they're selfish, full stop - proof another armchair intellectual living bubble, one needs listen to.

If ""honest, well-intentioned disagreement"". arguments based ill-formed logic selfishness, masked appropriation suffering others ad hominem attacks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, thanks even responding half points top. I'll assume meaningful retort. l

o

l Ahhh c'mon pessimistic: Ohio it, rest us. Again, understand terminology using learn basic critical thinking lecturing others. Herd immunity on/off switch. gradual reduction infections hospitalizations level manageable. question threshold lies.

So finally figured fact I'm ""zero-covid"" person want attack herd immunity? reach herd immunity, adequate social protection virus warrant reducing social precautions. That's woods terms social precautions. *Reasonable* people *reasonable* disagreements line ought drawn. 

I wish talking one right Despite even understanding herd immunity works, see fit shout term faces everyone thinks we're already sufficient downward trend start opening alleviate effects restrictions.

Again tall talk someone thought herd immunity meant ""zero COVID"", sounding like someone wikipedia term now, although still full grasp important threshold many Could *possibly* maybe people aware concerns raised, potentially stake do, simply reached different conclusion relative risks?  **Nah**. They're selfish, care people - decrees dude comfortably working home people file unemployment benefits.

How many nurses urging people open back up? Go appropriate suffering too....

Also thanks even missing fact brother, lost fucking job, insurance, debt we're trying pay off, shares views do, moreso radical mine. Again, serious honest interlocutor, I'm sure that's plainly evident anyone places low value time they'd bother reading exchange.

Again, describe wonderfully.

&amp;#x200B;

Also again, thanks even responding vast majority points above. I'll assume meaningful retort. Using point invalidate masks? far enough? anything? know, never really shut Texas. Bars simply classified restaurants reduced capacity sorta followed. I'm speaking someone lives Dallas precautions taken little bit seriously parts state. main thing that's changed concerts events happening, still case foreseeable future.

This really change much numbers reflect that. tons people taking seriously whole time.  Sure. India Africa don’t know. China Russia don’t want anyone else know. immune response it! stronger/larger immune response feeling worse. state Florida lies numbers arrests whistleblowers can't trust data coming them. surprised mandatory vaccinations become normal thing majority international travel, possibly kinds disease screening such. Also security/hygiene theater airports, public events, gathering places probably stay ramped unprecedented levels years; expect contagious disease basically new terrorism next household name threat happens. keep saying nothing changes aftr vaccinations haven't, purposely following honestly something want know need to, makes sense. mean, respect y'all I'm better without it. variant becomes dominant significant way though yeah I'll willing change attitude then. science support ending mask mandate point. keep waiting Desantis (Florida's governor) take Georgia Texas' lead outright BAN local governments making mandates.

Correct I'm wrong believe banned fines enforce mask mandates, effectively prevents town's mask mandate mattering since one going imprison people wearing masks. friend who's visiting family Florida right told time sees people wearing masks business specifically allow without one. Spare fucking histrionics unless worried infectious diseases claimed many millions lives covid ever existed. smart Bait. way hell county judge would ever That's importance ""has access to."" hit point vaccine, that's you. No, good luck us. may live there, impacted Well point? wearing mask increases risk people around you.

How year people STILL understand primary benefit masking? got mine today teacher! can't wait real life again. Yeah, dude, dick open weeks ago. Everything froze Wearing masks protect *around* protect wearer. Yes, still provides protection wearer, thing best block brunt viral particles expelled. need give vaccines chance work instead potentially sabotaging less 90%+ people Texas still susceptible COVID. timeline dictated vaccine rollout, personal preferences. ""you mask pry cold dead hands.""

FFS, one going kick door wrestle away you. Get die

Lol, please tell probability occurring healthy adult younger 65? Keep living life fear that's want. That's thought. People still allowed wear masks feel inclined to. stay home! Watch stream. People going bars getting wasted.

Sure wearing masks drinking etc

Time stop myth Japanese people like ants follow gov blindly don’t quarantine. lifting restrictions slowly. lifting time without precaution straight stupid. poor people supposed isolate job let families (the people live with) take 10 days off?  Well, got AZ shot 2 days ago side effects, although predicted 48 hours, disgusting. Headache, fever, general body pain, bowel problems, ducking back hurt like mofo, could piss sitting got nauseous trying standing like usually do. Given, first day really awful, given, too, Paracetamol helped lot reducing symptoms, still ma'afacka side effects. that's tell anyone wants listen. side effects awful, hope worth long run. father law got different vac time 2 things tell are/ horrible case munchies Sunday night (if things called ""horrible""). described ""the hungriest ever since days army"". arm hurts got shot, mine, that's normal, I'd reckon. Still, mofo. Let's hope best people (who supported mandate) continue wear masks Sure did. doors opened, opened. I’m positive limited 25% I’d bet hardly anybody acting like Sams Club counting people clicker. least they’re California New York may behavioral factor well. Knowing large percentage population vaccinated, people may likely flout social distancing rules. 

Almost certainly vaccine reduces transmissibility; it’s probably case conjunction social distancing get r0 close zero. Syrians Venezuelans obese even overweight biggest factor age. deaths much lower. comes chances COVID developing kinds mutations, every % counts. vaccine evading variants emerge, we’d saying goodbye hope country whole returning normal 2021. Biden mentioning mental health impact students learning remotely. Good hear I'll hold get Pfizer Moderna (maybe novavax approved time I'm eligible). matter right state took profession 1C group....so I'll waiting while. happy Texas. Hopefully pave way big states open ASAP 100%. thing taught us anything people trust experts enough. mess quite extent people stayed home worn mask asked. 

That goes doubly businesses course. office stayed open needs go, care money human lives. Also politicians take seriously, get voted back areas go me.

If anything CDC guidelines quite loose throughout. much longer quarantine then? Thx hint think misremembered. say reported 62% 90% efficacy 70% average. kind reporting calculated average really building confidence. already November. correct  Ik wanna show smiles lol

And I'm server so. mask looks good That’s messaging we’re 10% US fully vaccinated I’ll bet bottom dollar changes within two months Ah yes, mock people's real lives fucked thing could happen mean, could look states fully open ones restrictions compare charts.

For example, Oklahoma Florida vs. Oregon California, starting September 2020.  thread rude people. want participate sub, follow rules. .... know vaccine out. girlfriend even got hers. best idea? I'm sincerely asking. 500,000 people die flu year everything shut down, masks, social distancing? 

Do vaccine flu? 

Jesus dumb fucking thing say. wide spread farmland distance people, versus populated state every morning drive quarter states population goto work.

Yep. I'm convinced.   think agree areas healthy food convenient less healthy options

Yes, agree that. issue terminology. blows mind, masks relatively easy deal literally hurts one maybe small amount buy care saving people's lives mean people care saving people's lives. Good way overdue now.  Exactly. There's clear correlation shown Italian study, practically make difference. Try motivated data shows restrictions ineffective, instead feelings. Man happy honestly.. genuinely curious ending mask mandate many people followed going stop wearing them. Maybe optimist, concerned followed guidance mask mandate prior, would stop now? Likewise, twat bitched moaned first place never wore them, change anything them. careful wish for, might get it! guess forgot thread full anti-maskers LMAO live Tampa Bay, Florida. local mask mandate since nearly beginning, vast majority people wear masks inside businesses exception bars, gyms, restaurants. 

Even governor removed ability enforce mandate individuals, people continued wear masks. 

No one making anyone anything anymore. it. 🤷‍♀️

Hope TX keep spaces people forced share space, like grocery store. Please let us know law statute requires Twitter allow speech platform. Surely hand us. difference: logical end sight year ago zero clue COVID worked vaccines. Even variants pose risk, nearing endgame lockdowns still remain vigilant  tell people depression get fresh air too? Texas 😍 SMART goals- specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, important goals. I'm necessarily anti restrictions- I'm w/out acronym mind. Yes, magic number us vaccinated. 

We close number, never reach elected leaders playing denial instead taking lead teaching people vaccinations safe. absolutely agree. said, contraindications vaccine. fact CDC’s website lists three, don’t include many people. 99.9% adults get vaccine Abbott distracts base blaming failure manage freezing storm. need both

You can't actually force people stay home go store. also can't check temperature everyone grocery store, massive invasion privacy would take long. getting people stay home best method preventing spread diseases, can't tool use. must slow delivery drivers then, food always nice hot arrives. wish true. I've seen people HEB without masks. plenty people crowding lines giving everyone space. goal flatten curve. Texas flattened curve seems unlikely hospitals overrun point, I'm guessing reasoning behind getting rid mandate. Talking flu vast majority, is. think asymptomatic spread issue? people without symptoms. risk people vaccinated, pandemic pretty much over. getting everyone else. there's need restrictions that. No, cases acquaintances caused directly covid. isolated, many others gotten specifically getting covid.

What may understand covid gateway ton things downstream. Florida like long time cases going down. doomsday preachers need get grasp reality.  100% reopening interesting watch compare numbers rest country got month ago really tired one day afterwards. get second one Friday I'm taking rest day nice long nap We'll see...  Mine done since last June then... restrictions texas!! happy always found going pharmacy unnecessary waste time. common prescriptions (antibiotics etc), reason Dr office could right prepackaged hand out. Furthermore, unless I'm urgent need something, reason order Amazon pharmacy similar site .

The flu shot one things actually appreciate local pharmacy. book minute-clinic appointments online get much faster primary care physicians office. someone works home travels (well pre-covid traveled), in-office vaccine drives never worked me. Agreed, people need chill finger pointing. time agree someone comment it, pointless anger.

Reddit also quite bad this. guy usually expect couple angry replies assuming lot comment kinds things.  care people die flu?  nice see packed churches Easter? mask mandate affect economy relate opening economy? Masks one cheapest ways prevent spread wait herd immunity vaccination. Unless he's changed mind interview want say April May claimed lie. 

Fauci literally change mind within 24 hours without even hesitation may different story now. Yess restrictions!! could said April 1, 2020 many places. Prove it, then. testing question: long take run NAA PCR test COVID-19? I’m taking long takes get results. I’m talking bunch staff waiting around work got one sample started immediately, long take process sample get result?

I’m specifically asking ID COVID-19 assay.

Thanks!  Yep.

I'm Texas, little surprised got rid mask mandate soon. Honestly, feel elated right now, really starting hit light end tunnel. Florida way long time 

NO

WE 

HAVE 

NOT. 

Mask mandates still full effect enforced businesses counties. statewide mandate mean mask mandates.   think saying thing lmao  thinking walking around grocery store dodging people without masks, etc. Careful people coughing. Question - see number covid-related deaths sharply drop compared number new cases countries like Israel, groups risk vaccinated point? told vaccine affect spread prevent contraction all, rather merely reduces symptoms contract it. someone speak please? make big disruption lives, child develop fine Asian countries mask wearing standard  [Except you’re completely wrong. know haven't. Please keep comments topic civil. topic political discussion. comments already nightmare less hour I'd rather lock this. Thanks. really -- pretty clear going long slog. ULTRA SHUTDOWNS ""just couple months."" read around, people basically saying ""sure, lets open stuff, fucking wear masks"" Can't fix stoopid gonna pay safety precautions? Could also Texas late hit first wave? Pandemic response symbolic act culture war.  Wow you’re dumb. Americans literally went protested haircuts play golf. stupid be? Even don’t think lockdowns work you’re still fucking idiot goddamn entitled. ""Texas reopening right now, cases go way up!""

Just like they're Florida, Iowa, Dakotas, Tennessee, etc. Oh wait...they followed curve rest country. many times going go state removes restrictions people realize restrictions next meaningless? ultimately citizens government Denmark aren’t going care anywhere near amount vaccination efforts going Bulgaria opposed country , example - exactly EU didn’t want happen leads this. bro/sis Get hobby dude. Imagine spending time sub trying downplay corona.

Fucking pathetic. Putin tried murder opposition leader nobody much. locked guy missing parole hospital recovering. Imagine uproar I'm coming Maine late summer. would love able wear mask situations, certainly follow local regulations (at least!) going go last year, delayed due covid.  agreed, dystopian.  Many cases reinfection show herd immunity evaded Manaus. Ah covid. Something triggered viral infection unhealthy person. Long haul covid aka excuse unhealthy people claim lifelong shortness breath fatigue due lifestyle society giving covid. Texas Gov. absolute moron again, news, water wet. theory, hand face transmission even fraction likely airborne transmission, virus survive surfaces least hours, surface transmission significant simply virus air eventually settles surface. Volume square surface area theory concentration virus accumulate surface quadratically higher airborne concentration space, integrated viruses survival period surface. 
 
In words, infected person walks aisle grocery store, air aisle might infectious several minutes, food shelves remain infectious hours, infectivity compound time infected person walks aisle. 
 
But see case. seems like need solid dose right sinuses get infected. really good, hand face transmission likely would seriously fucked would mean masks would huge risk cross contamination. likely thinking behind initial hesitancy around maks recommendations. Disagree. Normalcy must return, even social interactions moral judgements. people FOMO, them. wearing respirator gotta say I'd kill wear cloth mask every day feel scared coworkers take less serious kill parents. No, going far. serious virus, whatever can, safe can, norm. anyone going comment official's word study? I'd love see evidence got banned Twitter pointing Patton Oswalt something murder wife showing autopsy report read inconclusive pointed numerous amount alcohol drugs system. fact home happened married woman already seeing less 6 months death. wear badge honor. ""**may** stop"" ""**almost** completely"", fact get later forever, going completely gone. click bait. Working feds? mask retire Stay negative guys! Noob question, dumbfucks refuse get vaccinated? impact spread keep covid around? got used wearing mask can't say like it. miss going dinner without mask, wearing mask general. sooner better. Need L'Hopital's rule That's terrible! hope feeling better soon!

I suspect I'd fall group people die got sort nasty long-term health issue idea horrifying. (A friend got ME/CFS viral infection years ago I've seen struggle.) lot bad shit capitalists general population gain done open totally legal, many ""conspiracy theorists"" defend also. I've found lasts longer wash bag. seconds away posting serious reply comment. kudos fine sir lady really responsible public health official.

close call either way. Lee seems like absolute lunatic. poor child. Separate equal stick current course IMO. late U-turn terrible look undermines confidence. schools. every business shuttered gavin intention ever reopen timely manner Yeah, that's novel way fighting it, even might draw voters' ire.

Where live - Ontario, Canada - provincial government mandated restaurants post caloric value foods menus. interesting measure, chips away underlying drive toward fatty foods bad eating habits.

I would still emphasize accountability practical form intervention something (or least seems like) personal choice. subreddit die... please? Fauci didn’t get Covid? What’s comment got it.... telling people overweight leads higher instances disease body shaming  would great gestapo officer Personal opinion, but...

If fully vaccinated decide travel, that's awesome, would same. please post social media. best, giving people major vaccine FOMO, worst, inviting negativity people either know full story believe dangerous fears virus still spread post-vaccination (even unfounded). vast majority dunno stops anytime soon. 

Because adult population mostly vaccinated, becomes far less likely children catch COVID somewhere wild. Furthermore, children (12 under, teens) spread COVID well adults far less likely widespread. Ok we'd 400 mill 2 vaccines sitting around already ordered paid em. I’ve already met customers absolutely refuse take vaccine. sub never dying. Uhh yeah that’s vaccines work administer like 180m+ flu shots annually months. Part line issues stem many distributive nodes would major pharmacies. be. Nothing desperate it. 

We're close, done daily numbers stopped decline parts country. 

Warm weather vaccines might convince people not. 

It's end world every single time US we've opened back cases come back. CDC reasonable thing making comment based upon numbers. Getting first vaccine two days. Thank god moderate asthma. That's great! thought quasi-ineffective comment also covered widely francophone media anglophone media read 

Nah specifically said interview British paper never repeated Europe. British media covering intention, worked. He's trying undermine British vaccine programme day 1 similarly desperate comments. Fortunately part work all, attempt still there. 
 
Purposefully trying kill citizens supposed allied nation vaccine disinformation campaign... stay classy, France. Words can't express endearment towards pointing obvious.

""obesity multifactorial complex condition driven myriad socioeconomic, psychological, biological factors ""

It multifactorial. 1 thing, like single factor education vs food access Good. moot point antivaxers thrive continue spread disease. ""Vaccination political issue, matter effectiveness reliability,"" Hungary's secretary state international communication relations, Zoltan Kovacs, told CNN Monday.

effectiveness reliability something expect beaurocratic monster EU is.

I hate country beaurocraticy unleashed upon world. know almost 40% tax law whole world comes Germany? Fuck that. Even article, really letter editor, says USAID overcome Cold War reputation meddling Cuba (a) fluke (b) direct, intentional cooperation CIA.

It’s funny article one ones come one searches “USAID CIA front.” Almost person really thinks one dude 2014. mean sincerely, snarky way- consider (virtual!) therapy appointment. Although everyone different risk tolerances, think head ideal. avoid lockdowns? didn't. 

Yes fuck lol ever asthma attack? I’m guessing think giving birth wearing mask even remotely comparable. Asthma attacks already make feel suffocated, add mask fusing mouth nose trying force air lungs, it’s hell. ""Other people contributing problem"" reason contribute problem. think either countries would risk political instability fake vaccine? know vaccines going scrutinized armies scientists. there's something wrong vaccine, revolution. Believe me, made sure happen. they? Trump talked much falsely took credit like made it. saw democrat governors create independent councils validate FDA's findings claimed trusted Trump. (with safety precautions like testing, frequent sanitation/fumigation, air purification ventilation/filtration, UV lighting)

You live NY, you? Thanks reply. 

So think pharmacies need hire exhaust staff? People contracted virus get sick again. know 2 people covid twice within span 9 months one 4 months other. Planned move overseas begin whole new life year. Instead I've hermit, cannot wait get vaccinated start beginning September! #sixseasonsandamovie see. Hopefully made compulsory enough things (flying, use public services etc) forced convenience. God knows ask nicely attempt force throw even fit. 

I annoyed even needs discussion. Refusing get vaccine prevents disease killed half million Americans one year reason evil, ignorant unnecessary. 

Of course, preaching choir here. vaccines require two doses: true 

A couple months ago ""the second doses given three weeks first dose"" also ""true"". Went eat last week kids birthday, wore mask whole time wasn’t eating drank straw mask. Made feel better whole thing might worth especially restaurants full capacity Honestly ""man, go out, wear mask"" effective reason I've stayed home

I bet intent effect important mask mandate direct effect masks transmission. doubt masks least small effect transmission, think experts really using ""nudge"" get people stay home. barely affected life 

It sure affecting kid’s life though. Yes. Packed stadiums last thing reopen.  Perhaps satisfying answer, believe education programs outstripped social trends pushing people toward fatty foods bad eating habits. Maybe education programs ever accomplish overeating issues like smoking, drugs, drunk driving, spousal abuse problems ardently fought dual fronts public accountability legislation. point being, would drastic government forcefully legislate overeating, education practical response. Coming resonant campaigns kids, parents, adults general get behind is, collectively, best bet fighting obesity epidemic.

I support idea capitalism incentivizes bad eating habits, think within capacity western country sharply steer ship aright (especially United States, hardline approach personal liberty). Weird pronunciation World War 2 putting specific selection pressure though, exist spread unchecked. Yes mutations happen often spread. nothing. Selection pressure results mutations spreading rapidly. Never Covid (as far know). severe anything, sore arm fairly heavy fatigue, notice anything second. Arm fine even. understanding covid contagious unmasked around someone infected minutes likely catch it. weeks back infection rates peak area live around 1/50 people actively infected given time. means decently sized group unmasked people extremely likely get exposed. probably seem bad 90% people catch never show mild, ignore-able, symptoms.

I lived no-risk life past 12 months. I've traveled, kept human contact minimum got tested trips. I've gone stores often necessary, I'm hanging around inside browsing wear well fitted mask. I've spent time friends many times without masks kept group size 2 tested recently.

Mention things subreddits like /r/BayArea people quickly call superspreader. I've tried research needed determine behavior carries appropriate amount risk. 3 anti-body tests, 3 at-home tests one rapid test I've never shown positive result. possible swung far side caution, anecdotal evidence supports me. I've neighbors throw parties dozen (untested) people got covid. Maybe there's confirmation bias I've forgotten parties I've heard everyone ended fine. can't wait filled interesting retrospective follow-on studies. 

Maybe also new projects leaned COVID learnings? Saw something yesterday malaria vaccine based COVID mRNA vaccines. Models suggest public mask wearing effective reducing spread virus compliance high (39). recommend mask use requirements implemented governments, or, governments not, organizations provide public-facing services.

Again, modelling means nothing real world results match modelling. 

California, mask mandate: 1,328 deaths per million
Florida, mask mandate: 1,443 deaths per million

Ohio, mask mandate: 1,484 deaths per million
Texas, mask mandate: 1,524 deaths per million

All worst states country - New York, New Jersey, etc. mask mandates. real world results match correlation amongst countries terms deaths per million. I'll passing myself, unpopular opinion here. I'll shopping mRNA novavax (when approved) vaccine. one change mind, bother. link seems suggest manufacture J&amp;J vaccine three awaits hoped-for emergency use authorization Food Drug Administration (FDA) end month, Johnson &amp; Johnson says key first step vaccine production take place three sites: facility Netherlands, manufacturing subcontractor India, Emergent's facility Disney World Universal closed nothing? looked possibly trip vaccination. cheap flights hotel rooms we've seen past year gone. Except /r/DunderMifflin, sub insanely active.  second day. said felt like hearing became muffled gradually turned complete silence virus spreads unchecks much greater risk mutation. infections = mutations. strategy massively reducing number infections also reducing mutation risk. doubt true.

However, would interested knowing many people chronic pain worsened given year without pandemic. learn anything this? pandemics vaccines common future? anyone know what’s deal SA variant UK now? Paging former FDA Commissioner Hahn... impression European counties universal healthcare, state supported college education, strong protections workers.

Is Scotland like America really respect? 

When people told one depend themselves, government agrees (as American south, live), people absolutely tougher individually failure isn’t option. unless want live bridge someone comes along stab blanket. 😂

We may speak English, don’t think lot common otherwise. 🤷‍♀️ ah ok, good know. seems better accessibility purposes send both, imho. want know why, remember downvote button reddit designed way mark spam trolling, think actually gets used. No, Americans work never said that, effects everyone everywhere. matter COVID, US, Brazil, Australia, Botswana, Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, basically country planet, daily life likely changed quite bit due COVID. something simple seeing interacting family friends changed. There's nothing else compare recent history nothing list feel rises anywhere close level.

The moon landing? Arab spring? fall Soviet Union? None nearly daily impact people every single country COVID. impact Arab spring day-to-day life average person South America? I'm betting whole lot beyond news story.

Like said, specific area world, might mattered lot, far COVID. somewhere else, might mattered much all. That's case COVID. Unless kind situation contact outside world, impacted. Haggling price liability details solution crisis, causing underprioritized delivery schedules.
Insisting full approval rather emergency approval whilst dealing greatest health crisis modern history. would think EU run people live little world sense urgency. 

Congratulations EU, figured urgent situations require urgent solutions. took exactly year figure out, absolute muppets. maybe trust won’t like many vaccines world.

Absolutely little longer. Wear safer masks now, get vaccinated never wear stupid thing again! Well mid 2022 mid 2021!  Yea exactly, already bought enough vaccine, enough actually.

Id make sense switch plans action mid execution either. agree, vaccine somehow unrealistically turns work (i know highly unlikekly)..I would still return normal, care anymore Yeah one talking ""controlling"" others

You're new here, lot people talk controlling others. mean literally, talking fines even jail time friends over. I've arguing people half year now. can't tell number times I've wanted eat healthy salad last couple years yet lettuce supply sketchy, mention getting harder come by, end eating processed food instead. restaurant city even offers decent salad Red Robin great.  half includes 90% 70's. kid there's probably people lack critical thinking actually believe OC lol. California open restaurants limited capacy weeks ago? I'm talking long term data, last week robots tell then?

Interesting. Pro tip: shouldn’t doubling KN95 cloth mask. 

[source: mean mid 2022. Right. Mask mandates go community transmission dropped sufficiently low rate. Increasing vaccination bring point sometime spring summer. see point.

That's something discuss physicians act accordingly based advice trained medical professionals insight personal medical history needs. Hey, think eating lightly seasoned meat pie cadbury crunchie bar exotic! Could possible COVID cross another virus example, Ebola? Ebola spread like COVID would absolute nightmare best, giving people major vaccine FOMO,

Not worst, inviting negativity people either know full story

Also believe dangerous fears virus still spread post-vaccination (even unfounded)

Still problem. 

Your FOMO, negativity, fears manage, mine. responsibility part spread COVID. I'm fully vaccinated, part 100% done, full stop. always, always, always people feel uncomfortable jealous travel, whether COVID thing. never responsibility deal this, responsibility now. like 80% populace Israel vaccinated now, spread stopped 'almost completely' there? lot people don’t even realize “medically obese” looks like could little heavy, big friends / coworkers. Amen!!  ... new super virulent cross-species strain coronavirus evolved SpaceX launch spread across globe birds humans alike eliminated humanity?

Why would wish thing?! approved - remember? ""experimental"".

[you disingenuous dense friend automod wants nice There’s lot good arguments single vaccination (potential short lived immunity), particular argument makes much sense parents making overeat it’s plate. Pharmacies literally chomping bit distribute vaccine. 

There reason, isn’t don’t know administer them.... vaccines developed prevent life threatening symptoms take hold person, vaccines going stop one becoming infected stop spread. line reasoning is: pay taxes, that's better common good!

Also, let's define ""normal"" means. senior **World** Health Official talks normal means lot different University Alabama AD talking normal.

So, here's question: University Alabama 100,000 people attendance football team plays Mercer September 11th?

The answer almost assuredly yes.

Yes, believe September 11th relatively low numbers community spread US COVID-19 longer pandemic level virus US, instead endemic virus longer substantially life altering. one knows safety children suprize...

From article:

EL PAÍS looks country’s Covid-19 inoculation drive progress several different scenarios: current speed, rate United States first doses prioritized

Spain administered two doses Covid-19 vaccine 2.6% population. Although pace vaccination drive picked last week February, rollout less steady month: every day, 0.17% population injected one dose, equates around 500,000 people per week. rate, European Union’s target vaccinating 70% adult population summer – amounting 58% Spain’s total population – met.

As graph shows, current speed maintained, barely 20% total population received two doses September.
-



Spain’s regions – charge vaccination campaign well handling response pandemic territories – prioritizing second dose Covid-19 vaccine, accordance Health Ministry’s protocol. three vaccines far approved EU – Moderna, Pfizer Oxford-AstraZeneca – require two doses, separated specified interval. result strategy, first dose administered around three weeks, alternates second dose another three-week period. solid lines graph represent evolution far: 3% Spaniards received doses another 1% received first dose waiting second. dashed lines show numbers people vaccinated evolve current rate maintained.

To reach 70% target, weekly vaccinations Spain increase fourfold. central government confident happen. Health Ministry announced 6.5 million doses AstraZeneca, Moderna Pfizer vaccine would arrive Spain end March. million-euro contracts new vaccine Janssen – requires one dose – vaccine CureVac coming months. However, Spain able quadruple number weekly doses administered, two conditions must met: vaccines must arrive time – delays past – must capacity administer them.

In general, Spain administering vaccines rate arriving. February 25, Spain administered 87% doses received, one highest percentages European Union, according data European Center Disease Prevention Control (ECDC), pointed limited supply biggest challenge EU rollout. Spain yet problem administering received doses, could start become one. first phase Spain’s vaccination campaign targeted staff residents care homes, frontline health workers adults need daily care residences – easily located – next stage includes members general population, essential workers, may present difficulties. “Vaccinating professional groups complex,” explains Jaime Jesús Pérez, doctor Vaccinology Association. “You least two weeks organize information gets vaccinated doesn’t.”


The country fastest vaccination campaign Israel, 37% population received two doses 53% received first. achieved vaccinating 200,000 people day – equivalent 2% population. Spain, rate 0.17%, nearly one-third speed United States (0.45%) United Kingdom (0.5%)

Best-case scenarios
The speed vaccination drive Spain likely accelerate. fact, 30% doses administered last week February previous week. well receiving vaccines, country also learning optimize process. Jesús Pérez points out: “We seeing usefulness mass vaccination points, sports centers, going key vaccines. lot people arrive time wait maintaining safe distance, something impossible health center.”

The question whether rate increase enough reach goal immunizing 70% adults summer. Here’s vaccination would progress three possible scenarios.


Four times number doses. Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez told lower house parliament, Congress Deputies, number vaccines arriving would increase fourfold second quarter year. repercussions evident graph below, shows number people vaccinated would progress if, April 19, number doses administered multiplied four. acceleration, beginning September, around 58% people would vaccinated, surpassing threshold 70% adults.


At US rate. Another optimistic reference based actual experience countries assume rate vaccination Spain match current rate US, 0.45% population receives one dose day. would not, however, enough reach EU’s goal: 50% entire population would vaccinated end summer, accounting 60% adults.


And first dose administered?
The scenarios simulations based strategy, one followed Spain: second doses always prioritized, three weeks group people receive first dose another three weeks people receive second. way, periods three weeks one dose given another three-week period second dose given.

Spain’s regions far followed strategy, idea guarantees maximum protection groups vaccinated. seen graph below, three weeks line representing first doses goes up; stops line second dose starts rise.


The model perfect, exceptions regions vaccinate different speeds. likely become less clear time goes by. moment, confirmation Spain, like Europe, following vaccination protocol seeks maximize number people received doses.


But viable strategy. UK, authorities opted outset administer many first doses possible postpone second doses – Pfizer AstraZeneca – 12 weeks. aim reduce spread virus soon possible immunizing many people possible: first three months pace fast number people least partial protection doubles.


The following graph shows situation Spain would like country followed strategy similar one UK. current speed Spanish vaccination drive, 5% population would received least one dose almost 20% would received one end May, second doses would begin administered. end summer, 25% population would received one dose 20% would given two doses.


Most countries rejected UK strategy outcome less assured – results Pfizer Moderna trials focused testing efficacy two doses separated three four weeks. studies using data Israel UK finding first dose already offers considerable protection Covid-19 risk hospitalization. may also prevent 50% transmission one month administered. Epidemiologist Miguel Hernan Harvard University published study effects vaccine Israel past weeks confirmed one dose provide high level protection, also pointed superior efficacy second dose. “Our results indicate single dose effective, although effective two doses,” says. “This surprising. already seen clinical trial. interesting see future studies whether spacing doses apart increases effectiveness second dose.”

As seen time pandemic, choosing strategies matter risk management decisions made based incomplete information. “As today, solid data confirm superiority using existing vaccines prioritize first doses [as UK does] rather complete vaccination regimen three-to-four-4 [as virtually countries do],” says Hernan. “With information currently available, strategies justified. Fortunately, two three months, vaccine availability much greater, debate cease relevant.”

They’re many, many generations removed original line. cell lines vaccine manufacturers sometimes use test trials. asshole first. Super smug tryna put people history... me. Canada's suffering lockdowns, medicine killing patient. love small town see local businesses struggling survive. turkey baster “Along way met 34-year-old Kris Slevens, guy who’s booked 350 appointments...”

Thank you. glad that’s sentence ended. to. Summer probably busiest time performing arts they've lost one already well almost whole year. need concerts summer survive. we're still bothered indoor crowds there's reason can't outside nice weather - time reach autumn would justification restrictions. wait 2 weeks US Merck. That's one facilities NC mentioned article. recommendation vaccines married two weeks ago! perfect, didn’t postpone cut guest list, everyone great time. It’s relief stress anymore, too. wish best wedding! idea, saw one mostly focused preventing death. going important give one remote places poor countries 2 doses might prove difficult patients Oxford actually *superior* efficacy longer delay doses. know would apply Pfizer/Moderna. However, 3-4 week used likely shorter optimal, chosen world wait trials takes months start. Every vaccine given several months apart.

""There isn’t much Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, trials compare different dose spacing compare one two doses. trials Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine include different spacing doses, finding longer gap (two three months) led greater immune response, overall participant numbers small."" understanding immunology really complicated one would able say sure without data, based vaccines quite possible prolonged interval first second dose would lead stronger lasting immune memory shorter interval mRNA vaccines well. mean, obviously giving two doses 1 day apart would good, know best combo 3 weeks 3 months 9 months apart tested. ""it's flu"" bros preaching brazil reached herd immunity? Plus needs international markets especially developing world. US produce 3 vaccines helping countries can't produce even 1. Thats messed (Looks mirror) Also showing science action. Really hope right! World War 2 infinitely interesting imo, I’d rather never think covid it’s done Oooh interesting!

And get that. Like makes harder workers customers get angry wait. (not me, remember ex talking people mean alllll time constantly asking pick shifts). Thats lame tho, I'm sorry :( Bloomberg tracker 7% guess rounding could approx 10% Less less vaccinated. Luckily wasn’t named specific year Covid blow dust 2027. pedantic all. big difference “FDA emergency use authorization” “FDA approval.”

There miles distance two terms mean. Yeah wearing mask bothers me, lack seeing people's faces constantly mindful distance, avoiding going someone's house, etc move NJ - smoke, gain weight. boom, inclusive group. Trust flu, real flu, getting vaccine too. never thirties knocked week. 4 days straight fever chills nastiness. Yyyyes. Yes, that's idea. Yeah were, comment literally provided purpose discussion mock me. even said ""I think know answer"" wanted reassurance. That’s great! I’m also tracking vaccines pretty close 20% vaccinated already! Trump done bare minimum would easily re-elected. Look Cuomo Boris Johnson. one worst outbreaks world act like charge handling favorability gets huge boost. Either keep staying inside let people's lives return normal. fair support letting people happier. 2 weeks second dose, I'm back normal. Idc flip flopping fauci says German government going announce another lockdown extension tomorrow March 28. means locked full five months. shops able reopen get unter 35/100k, basically impossible without enough vaccine available ages 65 79. sorry 😢 Lol it’s girl knew high school, she’s close friend close friend. don’t talk much. They're probably following restrictions better are. rate I'll shocked fully open July knows.

We hope, things worked last summer I'm kind reluctant optimistic. main reason states changing messaging halfway confuse people. Here’s thing: reaching “herd immunity” threshold isn’t quite important useful protecting small populations within ongoing pandemic people seem think. means outbreaks among *tend* die spreading entire susceptible population, even without additional control measures. *does not* protect unvaccinated people come contact cases. area continually importing cases, say reopening tourists places ongoing epidemics, unvaccinated people still need make sure directly exposed imported cases. *Regardless vaccination coverage* unvaccinated folks also risk secondary transmissions cases continually imported, since vaccination totally sterilizing.

High levels vaccination good protecting people vaccinated, “herd immunity” doesn’t really people imagine global pandemic reduced. Unfortunately that’s large group people. 35% hospitalized long covid. Yes I'm aware that, even difficult get tested number tests per week day stay fairly constant. means number cases *not* dropping unless suddenly testing less people. Man hope ironic. agree life move on. That’s trouble understanding. 

Money table? mean, sucks lose money, I’d rather great party later, okay one everyone needs wear fucking mask. *Especially* I’m forking tens thousands dollars it. 

Family expectations? pushing this? *your* wedding. *You* decide it. 

“Get with” seems like worst reason wedding. Pandemic not.

There nothing wrong getting married late 30s, 40s even later.

Note party, small ceremony legal wedding course completely different thing, definitely something done get with. virus doesn´t respect political rhetoric.

The USA bad Europe, UK complete disaster Brazil ""serious"" neighbors similarly bad even worse off. 

Go check worldometer. China afford vaccine diplomacy managed contain covid-19 risk pretty much nonexistent inside borders. West can't since overrun covid-19 needs vaccinate first. geopolitical consequences felt long time. kill millions people shutdown global economy, smart guy? Also, mRNA vaccines niche even among vaccine manufacturers

This would better worded ""mRNA vaccines brand new even among vaccine manufacturers..."" issues come obscure product instead technological jump awaiting supply chain trying catch up. Poe’s Law novel virus never approved type vaccine determine misinformation isn't? Besides obvious troll posts still much know yet. think masks gone end May knows. maybe wishful thinking

For masks one states, I'd say summer spring. They'll likely last go away, especially New York. Get standard dose get booster there’s supply ""They different efficacies different levels severity disease.""

Edit clarify:

""this Corolla goes 85 mph, Prius gets 51 mpg, I'm getting Corolla"" science, public health experts come message properly? missing opportunity big time. come? trying literally look anywhere sub thread news find answer... something wrong old man?  still able lift donuts fine ok. hope get people ""enjoy things love"" sick fucking football game. thing put lockdowns place people (and still do). I'm much anti lockdown followed lockdown rules last year. problem going long compliance going go - people reaching limits. We've gotten point people (like said, even people lockdowns) sacraficed awful lot reached point start acting needs going destroy soon. Lockdowns end say 'okay, lockdowns ending now' open. reliant us making decision following through. Also, say planned pandemics pre 2020 lockdowns recommended, never done before. downvoted ground saying earlier, hopefully someone engage let know I'm wrong.

Fauci specifically said vaccines allow return normal life, may still allow virus spread. here: things, even you’re vaccinated, you’re going able society: example, indoor dining, theaters, places people congregate. That’s safety society. You, yourself, together another person, looking that, we’re going try find quickly recommendations could made people do. things that’s universal know: point time, unclear whether get vaccinated might protected clinical disease, primary endpoint vaccine studies, could conceivably infected, virus nasopharynx, time symptoms, reason recommend say still need wear mask. virus nasopharynx, even though hope data comes in, it’s going show virus level quite low you’re transmitting it, don’t know now. reason, want make sure people continue wear masks despite fact they’re vaccinated.

I'm literally reposting something Fauci said, smacked down? feels like people image vaccines *should* opposed *actually* do. restrictions Oklahoma managed less deaths per million 35 states. Yes theory live Indiana there's ton stupid here. many people work thinking everyone else gets vaccine too.. dumb Definitely seeing bubble. I'm shot 2 weekend know least handful friends family interest getting vaccine next months sure portion definitely getting soon feasible.

I think we'll still struggle logistics getting people scheduled another month two eventually supply fully available, distribution problem, gets solved, pretty easy open anyone get people scheduled. types easier accomplished I'd hope opened wide registrations April / May timeline people getting vaccinated without wait June. friends fucking loser? approved emergency use authorization allows us use it. pedantic now. save coronavirus sub internet archive somehow? Idk works hard archived posterity. assume many people lived ww2 felt/feel way South Africa's covid cases dropped quickly? discussion South African strain better avoiding vaccines etc. case drop seems quite steep. read lockdown case drop still seems lot faster countries everywhere else Europe nearly bad? 

And three national lockdowns practically half year lockdown UK reached worst recession 300 years police goes people sitting friends parks joke? Yea, US WW2, always fun talk winning. Given 500k+ death toll, say US Covid war. talk it, US certainly win next Covid war comes. Thanks quick laugh course providing solid answer. Really appreciate hope you’re great day! senior, we're trying. everything new intimidating self discipline make school work. we've never responsibility. plus pandemic severe loss company alot us depressed fuck. check brother, make sure he's okay. hes probably struggling least they’ve moved shaming people outside all? 

On somewhat related note, got ticket game wardens kayaking “closed river” may 2020. hundreds yards away everyone jetted motorized boat. course weren’t wearing masks we’d accidentally waterboard ourselves, ended dangerous approach us let five six boaters paddle around waist deep water. I'm high risk, live someone high risk, OCD. Yes. serious. 

After year caution norm, i'm trying re-integrate world like normal person i'm asking reassurance. Thank making feel shitty though. please love god stay inside let us go back enjoying things love. witnessed incident grocery store thought two cashiers really rude other, realized actually friends (and likely smiling masks), started interpret conversation totally differently. really mind masks now, necessarily think they're great humanity. Personally, I'd rather get flu year (it's usually every years me). recorded death tally 2,642 October 1.

That's ""official"" total. Testing limited region. excess deaths recorded 2020 8,527. Lmao calm down, everything’s gonna open fall. got B1G school announced classes person fall last week Cheers full time job still school, it'll May June volunteer time... Can't wait till either dead, completely overtaken extremes society almost everyone rational moved normal life. said. someone wants hold longer, fine majority people making 81% deaths vaccinated, we'll much safer place

Why wait majority (say 65%) people making 84% deaths vaccinated?   safer? Haha depends state. Bars indoor dining closed two weeks Georgia creating dichotomy people think it’s fine safe go restaurant another group afraid everyone else. Set aside joint venture Merck gets vaccine money J&amp;J gets even money letting Merck manufacture contract gets percentage profit. Let's pretend charity. Colds influenza spread primarily droplets way COVID does. That’s aerosol experts saying COVID likely spreading aerosols year ago anyone listening - they’d researching rhinovirus flu virus transmission. PCR tests near perfect accuracy. thinking another kind test.  sure politician opinion rather tries follow scientific advisers.

Macron did, openly aired nonsense opinion press, slated U-turn him. Maybe others, is. publicly try undermine vaccine admitting evidence back (clearly listening scientists) , turn around try give age group claiming work against, that's U-turn, son. Probably lot us suspect given we’re 2-3 months away full supply suspect help global supply. Serious question: conservatives wanting vaccine? ones super supportive OWS vaccine development. don’t know wouldn’t want it. Depends, would rather microchipped FSB, CCP, Bill Gates?

KIDDING! Pfizer best numbers difference honestly pretty marginal, get vaccine good getting us closer end.

(Why guy getting downvoted legitimate question?) legit mistake troll, apologize rude. get people skeptical, right? government taken advantage new measure? understand others support want around forever, many implicit trust lasy long. article even points criticisms. UK cinema exec says many theaters might opt open implemented. article also points it'd create two tier society unvaccinated freedoms vaccinated. Younger people towards end line. America POC finding less access vaccine. implication older white people get freedoms back first. 

Besides that, carrying around health papers sounds downright dystopian. There's risk guys extremely minimal.

There's risk others may come contact later, also minimal. No. standby lists vaccine doses go waste. taking someone's spot line, making sure people 1C *can* vaccinated, line move faster. Cool, can't wait sub become r/AskCoronaHistorians yeah listen it. imo shit gets politically he's going reopen things deflect looks like happening right lol.

I think masks gone end May knows. maybe wishful thinking india donated 150k AZ vaccines recently planned supply us. sucks roll slow wait now. might get end year i'm way back list.


Hope get vaccinated soon. Since getting 2nd dose, I've made transition wearing tight-fitting silk mask filter loose cotton mask purely comply store policies state health regulations.

I think there's danger infecting someone else (especially considering live alone engage high risk activities), care enough argue store employee get dirty looks walking around. No. shots arms better, particularly shots would otherwise go unused. Signed, epidemiologist read it. little ignorant?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm sorry but... serious? mean, That's *want* think.

/s mean, saw videos folks China allegedly 'dropped dead spot' COVID. like idiocy borders. No. get vaccine get it. Two reasons:

1) Ensures doesn’t go waste 

2) Makes one less person get deathly ill potentially spread thing. 

Get wait list! going keep lower risk loved ones safe allows spread continue longer puts selective pressure variants, causing higher risk escape mutations. That's short sighted individualistic point view. option, we'd go hope best. option better protection available, makes bit foolish take chance. may take couple months longer get shot, better higher risk shot becoming useless within year. know effective 2nd shots spaced couple months. actually work like that- get results mess timing. Children susceptible virus. It’s shown repeatedly past year. “wake-up call” would shouted fat-shaming. Healthy size, right? Bill Gates SecretAgentIceBat !!!! they’ll likely help ramp production countries US right? Since 4 months country mostly vaccinated.

Is Merck American company? article paywalled me. probably knew well meant, I’ll correct myself: place “your belief masks don’t work”, read “your belief anything less N95 mask doesn’t work”. point stands: basis claim. 4 days seems like long time, may want call doctor advice don’t know means anything I’m last weekend June 100% pushing ahead. we’re outdoors ceremony reception plus several guests already vaccinated. read actual article, there's still pretty significant restrictions restaurants. indoor venues operating lower capacity. really smaller indoor venues. filling Celtics arena 50% quite including requirement six feet spacing tables, limit six people per table, buy asthma claim wife gave birth wearing N95. emergency situation pain meds anything. complain able breath mask give birth one. clearly never planned wedding involved planning wedding lol.

We postponed once, 30s, theres money table, family expectations, whole shebang. Life move on. I'm ready done. Yeah I’m kinda disappointed folks won’t get vaccinated bc it’s one want. point, vaccine vaccine, helps beat thing. 

People frustrated months COVID - offered tools end it. It’s time end it. hard understand wasnt put place earlier. 2 months waiting tough. Better tmrw, great took long Well see point man. We’ll agree disagree. don’t think opposite anyone favors either. Rocky III-style scene Merck coming across beaten, tired J&amp;J former rival:

*Now, fought, eye tiger, man; edge! gotta get back, way get back go back beginning. know mean?*

*Cue training montage, J&amp;J increasing supply ramping production 

*See look eyes, Rock? gotta get look back, Rock. Eye tiger, man* become like subreddits TV shows air years. Covid deadly, vaccine long term studies. Cigarettes deadly, vaping long term studies. 

I agree thought process all, people know get vaccine immediately would prefer stick known quantity matter dangerous is. 'The devil know' yada yada. supposed impressed this? America blowing usual bitching price tag. Spend god damned money get done.  cases don’t end hospital, do, apparently 65% don’t end “long Covid”. doesn’t work common. 

(I also think there’s lot work determine what’s actually long Covid - believe exists, like long-term problems happen lot viruses - versus what’s anxiety, hypochondria, psychosomatic problems, that’s separate discussion.) exactly do? Next thing know they'll saying can't cure COVID bleeding leaches rebalancing humors! What's next, disease *isn't* caused foul miasma carriers?!

Scientific stances change get new info. Frustrating may be, also scientific community normally takes time publish standards. COVID moved quickly us good data place took best guess.

Normally favor this. pandemic kind emergency situation principles matter less results. getting downvoted wrong... mean get US, I’d same... makes wonder happen water scarcity becomes common Macron take decision, something completely flies head people sub apparently. 

The HAS, French health agency, said clearly vaccine perfectly safe group ages due lack data, AZ vaccine prioritised 65s data available weeks. 

We're weeks later, data available vaccine approved 65. I'm taking 1.5 days extended weekend. flight going far cheapest part. need escape. field call *chiropractic* “chiropracty.” Otherwise yeah, lot complete quacks.

Lol. Yes basically agree, though seems fair call newly mass produced (though long studied) technological advancement, also niche.

Again expert, understanding plenty space multiple, different vaccine types indefinitely, even mRNA proves itself. understand people worship him.

Especially still. said really think probably would banned.  spoil WandaVision ep. 9? significant global event since ww2, look much old men still love talking learning that.

Good: technology enabled keeping economy life-support via internet / vaccine development.

Bad: lockdown/shutdown insanity. seen equivalent giving person labotomy depression. That’s fair, we’re still sticking outdoor projects ones going hanging inside house extended periods time yet get vaccinated list mile long point lol bet killed covids covid killed us part Scotland colonised Vikings. exactly live life individualistic manner. understand rugged, manly, powerful culture like me. feel special connection sea, that's wear life-vests, know there.

Also sign zocdoc don’t trust notify appointments available- keep tabs open call places yourself. Meanwhile Ontario won’t start vaccinating people 60+ June. Yeah, pandemic done, want done. don’t want 2024 things 98% normal, hear things like “there Covid outbreak town over, governor closed schools week”. still wear mask get vaccine? choice... call around refuse offering want. Yeah, Juicyjackson personally screwing Mexico Canada... want probe, go don’t hear Bill Gates whispering ear sleep? got first dose Moderna 45 minutes ago. injection spot definitely feels like sun burn. haven’t felt happy long! Hope get soon! sat several minutes trying figure response comment, but... can't.

So I'll give serious response say shocked much better experience wearing KN95 mask compared surgical masks cloth masks. assumed would harder breath on, actually much easier less glasses fogging issues humidity build issues. think you’re trying make straw argument I’m saying it’s healthcare workers I’m not



That's literally point fauci masks lie was..... concern healthcare get proper masks stand unable detect sarcasm. UK entirely possible deaths could double digits next week ICU admissions 80s single figures

How much data would like? reason continue blocking vaccine 65s could saving lives work hospice instinct certainly count. fact patients end life change fact people would consider hospice healthcare setting. read article scientists concerns covid variants becoming immune vaccines. bad rollercoaster ride. I'll wait evidence showing work. Yeah much slower happening. much like Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorld Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNE bought plane tickets Florida ($69 round trip 1400 miles away FTW) cannot wait. know anything reaction kinetics, case. Smaller people less surface area lungs, exchange less oxygen, etc. Thus, average, infections composed fewer viruses need correspondingly less immune response. given # viral cells inside body, immune cells higher odds colliding infected cells, producing again, less adapted immune cells needed fight infection.

THIS actual science, absolutely one allowed discuss apparently. shouldn't, FDA wants trials done Americans, least partly high obesity. sure countries. much so. really miss gaming conventions most.

I loved PAX east got demo games. want virtual PAX E3. would rather way safe.

Virtual concerts also lame fuck. would buy ticket livestream watch old performances YouTube real crowd. coworker told me, ""there's much bad shit vaccine, I'm putting body."" Mind guy heavy drinker smoker.. awe. seeing correlation causation.

The reason minimal Covid restriction states cases per capita fewer deaths per capita testing beginning pandemic.

The case count April peaked 33,000 deaths around 2,200. January cases peaked 255,000 deaths 3,400. urban states (New York, New Jersey) biggest outbreaks April testing low treatments better governments sent positive Covid patients back nursing homes. led low case/person high death/person metrics.

There's also another factor there's minimal restrictions people less risk likely go things get virus instead older, risk folks.

I take Oklahoma's approach New York's approach day week. Half deaths per capita people allowed personal freedom choose wanted live. joke lol. Obviously would take j&amp;j vaccine getting covid 


I took Moderna worry anyway blame individual psychology (that's Libertarian cop out) people always people. They've always lazy, greedy, selfish etc. traits suddenly get turned 11 '80s obesity rates started skyrocketing. 

So changed? system changed. food industry changed. started pumping sugar HFCS everything. Scientists labs started developing food like substances induced cravings tricking brain thinking unhealthy trash. 

No amount moral lecturing fix problem capitalism. fixes must systemic well e.g. repeating slogans individuals junk food bad they've ignoring 30 years. 

But frankly think American people willing swallow systemic changes would need made reverse changes.

I remember going /r/news instance reading comment section news story shops taking away sweets counter. could still buy them, right face checking out. enraged commentors took minor attempt partly address huge problem vile attacks personal liberty, something akin Stalinist tyranny. 

To people shorter, miserable lives worthy price pay fulfilment ideology (while also profitable corporate interests pushing deregulation ideologies). mind asking guest size city state in? issue compounded fact AZ also decently strong side effects, even younger people.

Yes Germany stable 20% take it. point don’t feel comfy coming, don’t come, wedding. 

Preach. hold anyone coming. Spring weird events gonna like that. Come don't, guest. wanted start work around house too, seems like people wear masks home improvement stores. go grocery store gas station everyone masked up, home depot/lowes maybe less 50%. sure different, I've started ordering stuff amazon usually would buy person. thought government 5g free... let hopes go high guess. Cries Canada HELL NO, fatties get everyone else, can't stealing vaccine rest us cause can't stop pigging food every country secluded island little impact global economy Count blessings, Canada still 5%. don’t know anyone else, personally take risk getting cold flu 2 times year reduced communication connection intimacy stemming masks 11 days 10. 

I don’t think masks go away healthcare settings, honest health centre university made put mask enter (and 5 years ago). personally makes hospitals, health clinics much depressing environment ... guess want make sacrifice can. 

However, masks non-healthcare settings extremely depressing there’s way trend continues average person’s day day life. say communication isn’t hindered everyone wearing masks like saying phone call intimate video call - isn’t. There’s communication audio, think it’s something we’re desperately craving. sucks state throughout whole ordeal. first time life genuinely wish Florida haha Hahahaha. Moderna Pfizer hitting capacity production specific lipids nucleotide-related components needed generate vaccines. contrast, JJ vaccine grown vats using relatively well-known techniques substances limited. vaccine composed modified adenoviruses grown specific cell line.

Sweden elderly may hug grandchildren two weeks second dose. that.... you’re fool enough believe vaccines work long term, you’re fool enough believe vaccines work variants. already part, place almost ghost town already compared year ago. r/gatekeeping guess used /s... article is. 

I'm UK, we're great job. comparing 1 dose % 2 dose % dumb multiple potential explanations ""closing restaurants bad."" peak later lot states, effective treatments came around. Plus shipped lot serious patients neighboring states (I personally know two people got transferred state, one Texas one New Mexico). understand it, someone gets transferred one state another, death certificate filed reporting infrastructure state died in. Even true Oklahoma's deaths bottom third country, counting COVID deaths metric matters unfair. COVID lasting effects people, plus lack care available overloaded hospitals spread considerable suffering people something COVID. true.

I actually saw something like real Twitter thread virologist weekend. discussing certain aspects vaccination J&amp;J one, approved thread. person actually ask never got vaccine COVID-01, COVID-02, etc. person seemed sincere question, deleted tweet virologist politely answered ""19"" for. Ireland 60% fully vaccinated start July. I’d enough make major difference guarantee start testing animals search ""reemergant"" strains sure deadlier lockdown inducingier ain’t authoritarianism. I’ve seen loads folks without masks, about. punishing folks throwing jail. might bad. 

If want authoritarianism, look China did. still using old pcr amplification cycle? skimmed headline saying something like read article Ah youre scotish. Makes sense. probably was. 

We're hearing today, sort things get announced soon execs start talking other. Biden's president 40 days, sounds like something started trying put together quickly learned supply issues (which literally happen 21st - previous administration misled state vaccine supply). 

Also, per Andy Slavitt ""In Bubble"", administration *really* want make optimistic public statements may bear fruit. make announcements things they're confident rather offer false reassurances. Alright man fun basement forever  J&amp;J different. cant compare vaccines. Different trchnology altogether. J&amp;J trial one-shot only. Pfizer Moderna said chose go two pretrials effecive bad WTO preventing vaccines generic (i.e. using open patent anyone make it). Instead everyone backing company monopoly vaccine.

Honestly one ghoulsih decisions made whole ordeal. Really hope supply bump makes fraction damage Also often mentioned “herd immunity” concern. Needs kids vaccinations happen. think goalposts moving all, rather we're yet end pandemic yet got shot day bsing w one workers saying huge benefit also dealing transient risk populations. People like homeless may tougher ensure schedule double shot like others.  Thanks confirming! thought heard sure.  also confused people got appointments. I'm essential worker health condition 3 chances make Walgreens appointment. Every time told eligible. They're 65+ according I'm reading, even though documentation links state guidelines I'm eligible 2 fronts. Talk moving goalposts. know even bother. fun isolating rest life. US trial finished yet. next month may disconnect 5g time time preserve battery life That’s too. Even second shot felt cold-like symptoms day. However arm sore point reaching seatbelt car struggle. Thanks heads up! plans next days good. I’m kinda way, except don’t like them. would love wear flu season, go work I’m sick won’t infect everyone around can’t get work. also cover acne don’t wear much makeup. 

I hate though. I’d like able drink water I’m public work without putting everyone around risk. They’re miserable it’s raining boiling hot. state require agency affirm employment kind self-attestation? latter think clear self-attest qualified vaccinated. former could volunteer coordinater write note saying without commenting vaccine eligibility? Hospice patients life expectancies 6 months recall correctly, there's good reason avoid inadvertently bringing covid getting vaccine. Meh, elderly high-risk people - ones *by far* likely require hospitalization die - vaccinated, “omg cases!” numbers mean less less. guess keep asking everyday till stops. approving now. moment AZ vaccine approved, enough data 55 year olds approve (according vaccine authorities countries least). already said hoping able extend use data voila. Literally nobody wants say this. point keeping things closed political poison Democrats Republicans alike. That’s idea! guy anti vaccine anti seatbelt. trolls lot here. Yeah tracks experience. Think someone drive second. pulled way home gotten Uber. 3.8 million dosis low make percentage, sample research low you. reasonable approach. I'm willing bet ""silent majority"" people camp. even read children infected SARS-CoV-2, get sick COVID-19, spread virus others, less 10% COVID-19 cases United States among children adolescents aged 5–17 years

Whereas, go endocrinologist US diabetes present couple extra pounds says nothing weight might increase insulin dosage! find incredible difference. Same. Someone said wanted big indoor wedding everyone vaccinated years now, said something effect ""The 5g connection would roof"", bam. “Look drawing made COVID19!” may missing point entirely. 

The CDC tell us leeching worked. *did* tell us masks work, type claim potentially get booted Twitter. 

If allow type scrubbing history give organizations power cover mistakes.

That incredibly dangerous. Oh yeah trust me, hence point plenty money made.

No one free, end day long get shot go back normalcy. Sick. Flu-like symptoms, aches over, 102 fever, chills, headache. Yada yada. Lasted maybe 12 hours, started 10 hours shot. Inshallah know AstraZeneca hasn’t applied emergency use US? Crystals incense metal statues naked people really nice, actual medical stuff, avoid like Covid19.

Dude took 240v vibrator jammed side glute hard, depth vibrations my... Area... basically felt like passing gas solid two minutes.

Never going back. *cries PA* people gonna do?  course listen. need told again. 6 know severe hair loss second round!! forgot that. make holistic medicine asking make something stop hair shedding. No, thinking normal PCR Test!

But biggest factor wrong Results introduced Humans. food desert? never concern dangerous.

There previously lot data effective protecting elderly.

Data starting come countries previously recommending elderly starting so.

I think difference cautious (if turned vaccine wasnt effective exact population used would undermine confidence well prevent death illness) leaders Macron spreading fear vaccine ending recommending. Given position irresponsible. Yeah too. friend acquaintance. He’s terribly. He’s blood brother, foster care kicked 3 houses mental health hold week. Lack social structure school, isolation bogus zoom counseling sessions etc, come close killing  countries might fully vaccinated soon let in. get exotic. Pfizer planning applying normal approval April. need 6 months data get full approval, already getting data. Lol, *you know mean*. find comment pedantic w/out regard colloquial- something many commenters sub fail parse fairly often seems. 

There two layers this. Imagine soldiers Battle Stalingrad felt, talking amongst they'd like futures look like survive war. someone chimes in, ""well actually, war never *really* end- we'll still talking effects, happened, got here, etc."" Which, sure, guy would point- but...

*Then* woke Feb. 3rd, 1943. Yeah, mean read CDC website health websites; getting news facebook youtube, everyone around live seems get it.  true.

No one talks don’t exist lol We’re way beyond psychological problems. normal now. 

Parts US quite thin parts fat hell. Culture matters. 

The slightly pudgy kid grows Eastern KY feel pretty normal moves DC sees he’s fat. chinese japanese bows low. Ok, good. Go eat. say vaccinated people meet up?  assume whole world gets vaccine. correct flu higher death rate. need tolerate increased risk comes unfortunately. studies show ""modern"" children asthma live sterile environments

Do source this? makes sense intuitively I'd like read it. live richest country richest people live lol, everybody well financially. Even personally know “middle class” people risked foreclosure not. It’s genuinely scary. CDC 96 million doses delivered across country nearly 77 million administered.

Does make work you? like second paragraph article. sounds worst COVID bout, although, long-lasting maybe permanent issues it. I'm 56 though major high risk group slightly overweight. Absolutely. 8 month old, even though kids get sick Covid I'd rather just...not get Covid? states government won’t make requirement sheer political provocatively. know personally- thanks look vaccine actually works see there's really potential long term effects, doctors listen health advice almost also recommending everyone get vaccine can.

I see skeptical, one afternoon reading basically tells need know.

And there's people vaccinated 2 3 months side effects besides within first couple days (which mild body producing antibodies fight virus). No, standby lists exist reason. Tell what, man. Give address I'll come weld windows doors shut avoid temptation.  problem reddit I've read similar comments entirely sincere. hope looking 35%. Agreed would huge issue. think public health officials want everyone vaccinated... I'm surprised conservative states putting barrier especially around immigration status. Everyone know expressed intent keep using they're sick airplanes, probably day day going places. They’re two doses five-ish weeks apart. received first shot mid-December second late January (in Ensemble2 trial). Seems like something could started months ago. started day Merck stopped vaccine efforts. short answer mRNA tech requires production lipid nano particles act mRNA carrier. easiest thing can't build capacity overnight.

J&amp;J adenovirus vector vaccine. far common vaccine manufacturing tech. even use make influenza vaccines. plants better equipped make vaccine high volume mRNA vaccines. CA :( currently 155million cases 2.5 million deaths worldwide. 1 year expect arm pain. people know mild symptoms arm pain real. brother described best saying felt like Randy Johnson threw fastball arm standing ten feet away. Went away day two take easy can. Yeah. Derek Lowe written Scientific American hard mRNA vaccine manufacturing is, sort thing particularly easy scale quickly. (If reading regular blog updates, strongly encourage it; here's recent entry mRNA manufacturing: ) Yeah next thought, much initial shipments j&amp;j? Knowing isn’t even included legitimately impressive. Trying get hopes much keep thing mostly behind us summer 🤞🏻 Florida also shown litterally fudging numbers, addition governor covid denier. Minnesota, covid testing centers armed civilians outside it, trying discourage people tested. states covid testing covered insurances, state itself. states better financial safety nets covid (my brother get tested cause afford wait payment). long even wait get results (2-4 days, 4-7 days, 7-10 days, 10-14 days) determine person feels like worth tested all. Testing sites per capita vary. Attitudes towards testing vary. There's lot variety, Florida great track record, little bit I've heard. fuck lump us them? interviewer specifically referring Mexico President Mexico going meeting Biden regarding us getting vaccines bought... oh well Americans wanting us still border control stopping Central American caravans getting US. mean that’s governments already many cases. Murphy said yesterday state done vaccinating sometime May major spikes March continue easing restrictions. Thanks. I'm super worried, want know expect. Heck, vaccine could come kick nuts I'd still happily line it. may little soon, sentiment ""just hang two months!!!"" kinda moot point. Florida wide open months and, last checked, people still alive there. Source that? [This poll saw Euro vaccine skepticism. Masks permanent fixture public. Look flu deaths 2020/2021. save LOT lives continuing use masks perpetuity. totally agree. know issue handled Twitter, etc. mean, that’s idea behind vaccines. don’t get virus don’t spread it. That's unfortunate.

Assuming received Pfizer jab, around week early start hugging anyone.

Peak immunity reached day 32 (counting first shot).

In first two weeks, vaccine yields virtually zero immunity. Yurp. fully expect feel guilty existing least end year. I’ll probably switch back feeling guilty existing environmental reasons mean Hospitals fine, fine, fine. Open shit already stop politics money grabbing. planning 7 years could eventually subreddit 2.4 million subscribers! would foolish *ever* lift mask mandates. looked flu statistics 2020/2021? We've saved many lives effectively avoiding flu season entirely. really wish people better able grapple trade-offs. Like yeah would nice everyone could control eat problems, know that's realistic. diets gyms country people fail diets over. sign gyms go. 

Nobody wants lose freedom (including fat people), there's ways simply re-incentivize behavior without banning things, healthy country would lot fewer restaurants (fast food especially) lot grocery stores. many F&amp;B brands proliferated survive long Americans eat poorly. nobody's ready even imagine that, let alone advocate it.


I think obese people alive right die figure right changes make, maybe there's hope next generation. That’s thing: miss nastiness bar. greasy spoons, dives. that.  US 4.2% global population, 21% Covid deaths (&amp; something like 20-25% prisoners IIRC). love country goddamn... Though /u/GoingLegitThisTime mentioned, countries could significantly underreporting deaths. Seems it’s never matter staff give shots it’s enough doses give. I’m sure hospitals could easily get remarkable number people vaccinated enough doses. nicotine long term, heart going 120bpm days nerves lit feel like someone removed skin sprayed vinegar, it’s hard see people turn things. 

There’s always benzodiazepine, totally safe won’t ruin life; doctor gives you. clue, I’m upvoting hopes someone knows chimes in.

(bit.ly/2ZYX0JM) Yikes. hope governors aren’t jumping gun. opening ASAP, smartly. Yes, site took numbers from. 50%+ drop cases 70% drop deaths 6 weeks indicative significant reduction Covid prevalence harm? Funny guys getting downvoted. Right you. mean? mean instability countries. Imagine uproar British research group would deem Russian vaccine unsafe. It'll referenced lot forthcoming COVID-24 sub. thassa lotta vaccines know Pfizer shot hits?

But absolutely COULD free speech laws. era communication facilitated small number powerful technology companies, may public interest require certain standards. might enacted making sufficiently large tech companies ""common carriers"" FCC?

Realistically, though, idea long term implications would be. interesting question going forward issues resolved, now, protections, mercy Twitter Facebook, etc. bought vaccines, fact country supposed closest ally left us rot hand country America pressures us embargo actually proving worth damn. J&amp;J included yet started administering? understand. lot comments following underneath much vein meant like ""God, pants uncomfortable, wish wear them. mean I'm gonna jeez"". I'm still gonna complain cause hate them, I'm absolutely gonna complain actually wear *keep people dying* literally felt nothing either shot, sore arm. weird seems differ person person much without real reason seems. pretty much virus movie Outbreak. Euros... never knew Mexico part EU.

I never said Mexico part EU.

I simply said Canadians Europeans wanted border US closed permanently. reason didn’t include Mexico simply seen many comments them. Still waiting group next it. Shouldn’t long point hope. I’m leaning getting one two doses since seem effective. it’s this. work healthcare amount oversight government gained pandemic truly staggering. started ask questions might ease response essentially won’t. government loves grab liberties America‘s time need, reluctant give up. WhilevI mask mandates vaccination, wary giving big brother power need.  Youre getting downvoted truth. Fauci stand this. Supposed get first dose today... Nervously excited. hope endgame soon. want able see hug grandma. Yeah feel guys. parents burbs way able get vaccinated drive hour away. reading Philly burbs getting way less per capita vaccines allocated counties way Styx wonder it’s going slowly. also read state supposedly “reviewing” allocation strategy got called fingers crossed improves soon. Yeah pretty obvious, never thought would come day Russia China would better ally Mexico neighbor. American greed works wonders... Texas opening 100% capacity ending mask mandate. Watching Abbott's press conference now!  I’m good, I’d appreciate referral someone teach discipline. know I’m overweight, know root cause is, seriously feels like Herculean task stick workout routine depression-eat drink. 

Finishing college, working masters degree, jumping wildly different jobs careers throughout life... less daunting sticking exercise routine me. It’s certainly contagious. idea soon sit drinks you’ll get silly, like said we’re 35-40% Americans contracted year, that’s vast majority people going work everyday (the world isn’t Bay Area, composed wealthy tech workers). 

But regardless risk getting it, point harm comes getting it. Covid bad kill you, risk Covid killing young person minuscule, dwarfed causes death. doesn’t mean 0 risk, something like car accidents 10x dangerous someone age don’t shame people driving. young people, risk driving places much much higher risk hanging places. 

Now make point young people spread higher risk older people. vaccine offered higher risk groups, need worry vaccines nearly 100% effective preventing serious illness death. even young friends aren’t vaccinated, never significant risk Covid. probably get vaccinated increase risk death even percentage points, refuse dumb reason call risk barely measurable. Great Diamond Yes statements I’ve read people like Fauci, others, less specific date, “by summer” it’s going become clearer get closer point, bet. guess point still non-marginal risk death spending time unvaccinated people fully vaccinated.

I sure accurate statement considering data we've seen vaccines, however might correct. Completely agree. fact mildly surprised minority tbh always next week... mean antagonistic way, find crazy people complain wear mask. UK we've stopped living lives year, mask nothing compared that. wearing mask while, like putting hat used wearing hats. surprised accidentally put one habit over. bother slightest.

Not able see friends family, hate. Wow, wow lol I'm sure call 'body shaming' crap like that.   would need masks next winter? Either vaccinated vaccine turn new variants flu. damn fault. way points cross graphs funny me. like yeah, utah bad outbreak pushed numbers nevada idaho exactly. people post political views superior everyone else bad agreeing. must suck live life like that. hasn’t built yet. get it? getting Russia complaining about? Fuck that. I'm bringing mask ever spring.

I'm wearing one winter. I'm grandma killer it. Fourteen days pack walmart home depot like it. /s nose swabs aren’t thing anymore? Broken title. bet positivity rate 0 2018, nobody checked. could get ones bought... seeing stuff developed maybe accept Russians Chinese far better allies Americans... Yup, Moderna first dose sore arm next 24-48 hours. Still waiting receive second dose. live Montgomery county current rate, won’t see vaccine I’m actually 65+ J&amp;J people's arms yet? First Manaus' prior 70% seroprevalance largely debunked. besides that, second surge cases seen primarily different demographics Portuguese. Covid kind forgot Iron Fleet and Euron's forces, certainly haven't forgotten about it.  US, strictly vaccine administrators check conditions? I’m eligible right considering lying something, I’m deathly afraid getting infected desperate dose situation led variant variant led current situation. Hell yeah mofo.   Mask randomly controlled proven efficacy. It’s misinformation state fact opinion yet could get banned “anti-mask” that’s problem know it. doesn’t change simple fact bought vaccines America prohibiting exportation vaccines bought.

Not problem fucking care This^, everything Newsom started I’d surprised doesn’t win recall election. He’s given stimulus check state residents huge mention he’s also basically kicked overdrive help small businesses giving grants loans forgiveness said loans fees. Secondly, vaccine rollout slow beginning going insanely fast. California I’ve always seen train, starts slow starts shoveling coal engine; man oh man start going faster faster nothing short nuclear bomb stop it. Currently California capacity vaccinate 3 MILLION people week California getting 1.5 million vaccines week. Finally, schools reopening teachers getting 10% vaccine supply every week schools reopen sooner later. recall election happens Newsom believe win. serious variant allowed spread freely. Yeah, I’m unfamiliar process vaccination sites sounds like don’t even require insurance information processing Normalcy must return, even social interactions moral judge

Its miracle made far life pre-Covid. seems like everyone needs told take shit days. think we're stuck individualistic framework really solve obesity anytime soon (without miracle drug least). personal responsibility, going gym, dieting. 40% Americans obese, think problem bigger one solved individually. 

But really hope turn corner soon start coming solutions beyond going diet exercising. people simply cannot adhere them. want able go concert. wish could college graduation. Meanwhile, Super Bowl family FL go bars, leisurely travel, attend bike week... barely done anything year. guess feel better done part contributing problem. Damn sucks guys make Fatties Per non-scientific survey restaurant parking lots happened weeks ago. EU auditing SII potentially get deliveries vaccines too. would swell. 2nd dose. I'm trying help! Philly residents anyone who’s seen headlines coming vaccination effort going far know badly need legitimate efficiently run mass vac site like this. city hasn’t exactly instilled confidence abilities something magnitude think exactly need. Glad hear many cities benefit sites well. Yeah even doctors get it... confirmed positive first time second time doctors hospitalized couple them. bad. Give normal dose. become fat imagining doctor taking like half cup vaccine turkey baster jabbing someones arm like Monty Python sketch. data shows almost always reduces hospitalization nobody died. Get can. one coincided world war. got shadowed. one live US screwing Canada, Mexico, maybe Canada Mexico set factories produce vaccines soil like US has. Obese people much higher mortality rates COVID. high risk group according data.

The greater benefit would vaccinate risk people first. 30th 191 okay 38th 191 bad? It'll also around next Coronavirus! nephew epilepsy intellectual disability still can’t find vaccine! Virginia, rollout actually decent is. option isnt taken away though. literally going move unhealthy foods different section inside store ffs. far difference ""lower increase profits"" ""bankruptcy."" 

""Oh noes! made 3.4 Billion year! made 3.2 Billion last year! means we're failing need bailout money! want us go bankrupt!?!?"" Aside vaccines, studies found plasma effective, extremely expensive?  think need check math. places problem finding people vaccinate. goal reduce hospitalizations death, x amount vaccine give away, makes sense give people higher risk. 

Obviously surplus give anybody possible make sure gets used. Well big reason macron Germans together. macron people listen much guess.  think worst group going forward going anti-vax people also think keep strong mitigation efforts, think they'll small percent (I've seen one Reddit far myself) yet blown proportion anti-mitigation right wing people (both us versus mindset want paint groups ridiculous extremists). Anti-vax, anti-mitigation people also suck right especially high percent anti-wax people altogether enough people vaccinated eliminate mitigation changes, they'll mostly irrelevant. Send links studies. doubt interested learn immune response consists T-cell reactivity. persistent presence B-cell reactivity still produce antibodies. Maybe graduated college entering medical school maybe know basic immune system functions.

The end result ""no severe infection, guaranteed"" 3 years people some, last 6 years know why.

Presumably, already know 80 years HCoV knowledge 18 years HCoV immunity knowledge.

What eat STRONGLY impacts caloric intake.

Sure, CICO, yes, make eat eating right stuff, eating much it. Seems weird December Manaus chaos. downplayed, US went 300k cases day 4k deaths. relief, too. another incredible surge despite vaccination, experts warning us similar catastrophes, people still putting fingers ears, see pattern? bot clearly didn’t grasp part agreed virus shed way. haven’t heard say, however, valid reason form shedding treated even remotely similar risk respiratory droplet/aerosols transmission MUCH easier spread?  UK variant dominant strain UK cases dropping precipitously despite increased transmissability. Social distancing measures + vaccines clearly enough combat it. isn’t vaccine news. Donor plasma vaccines Thank much this. always frustrating see here.

&amp;#x200B;

Particularly since actually stop antibiotics, not-antibiotic resistant bacteria outcompete baddies goes bye-bye. stop antibiotic use population while. think lot refuse get it. think least realize certain businesses going start requiring vaccinations able get hired use services.  mind boggling. got first dose February 4th second dose February 24th- don’t take daughter therapy clinic day go inside. caregiver obtained vaccine 34 year old healthy woman, though single mom. daughter also super severe- premature delayed. said- vaccinated parents therapy clinic rather sending people Dodger stadium turned away. There’s stories NPR Latimes it. kids epilepsy ventilators night. personally know enough since field expertise. would assume taking approach seem best given current info. wear N95 mask surgical mask. I've wore two masks whole pandemic. 

I remember people taking piss online Kamala Harris wearing two masks, thinking ""but effective though."" PA seems shitting bed drove NJ got mine CVS. Maine’s choice change schedule going cause lot problems. went getting two weeks “maybe May.”

But biggest problem soon weather warms people ANYTHING anymore. Everyone fed up, vaccine makes feel safe even don’t it, even worst Maines numbers enviably low.

We’re get inundated wave mask less tourists care “getting lives back” living expense locals’ health.  Kingpin entered chat idea might see cases really start fall again? It’s week 7 day average less plateauing seemingly caused mix new variants premature relaxation vaccinations still ticking lot optimism normal summer would hope would see serious decline 7 average soon. won’t find scientist talks future definites. 

Ask astrophysicist sun rise tomorrow. Hell, ask particle physicists protons stop existing tomorrow dont blame government to, blame people dont give shit following basic rules. perfect scenario rotten people ruin everything majority. Brazilians ground care point? ignoring completely? Oh shit too. Nice. Wow. You’re gem. hope republicans get it... Come June? I’d expect domestic travel entirely open June. know plenty people turn J&amp;J...sorry gonna happen. variants concern otherwise still subject surge pattern Covid usually takes. Tons anti vaxxers there. Reality care. Yes, also decades experience “close 50 years” approved similar type ebola. disease far fatal covid even imagine. adenovirus used type common cold. also side effect profile already established. short term would result lower drug prices kill patent law. long run means see many new treatments. Yes reason five hundred thousand people died novel respiratory virus people twitter tweeting things true. ""Spoiler alert!""

""Spoilers apply 30 years finale!"" Also near future? (Q2) r/gatekeeping I'd disagree. things mentioned long-lasting global effect day-to-day lives people. certainly mattered lot countries, whole lot short period time, everyone extended time. Meanwhile, there's country earth changed dramatically year COVID.

COVID unique fact there's almost one alive whose life past year dramatically impacted it. Things like Arab Spring various wars Moon landing big news stories, level impact everyone's day-to-day lives extended period time. Officially, pandemic never started FL. Yep... America land fat. Oh wow, behaves like vaccines ever invented. ever could guessed? I'd look first cavity say, ""That cavity completely empty.""

Then I'd look next cavity say: ""That cavity stuff it, one, full.""

Particularly last year saw cavities 100% stuff it.

Seems like piss poor assumption cavity 20% stuff packed. universal healthcare? Paid college? Job programs work? Unemployment support? Housing support? genuinely don’t know Scotland. I’m telling America. 

When get sick, fall crippling medical debt ruin lives. yes, happens even people health insurance. 

Don’t sure wouldn’t insist two doses Pfizer/Moderna sitting shoes. 

A lot us interest statistical games. Calories? None taken, respect opinion. 

I think what's lost twitter policing anything instead looking remove Misinformation. example, Anti-Mask, Anti-Vaxx stuff garbage rightfully banned. 

Keep mind much Twitter policing truth instead twitter social media platforms abused nations/corporations influence elections polarize social issues. first step mitigating impact propaganda targeted misinformation campaigns. Arizona resident wife Toronto, it’s nice win change. Haha LOL. Nobody following anymore. here. fact sinuses fucked since mask implementation. Deviated septum combined allergies, fact didn’t wash mask often should. 

It air producing humid air outside mask. live desert basically humidity. happens bunch moisture gets trapped inside mask inhaled over.

Either way I’m 100 percent sure mask made sinus issues worse. don’t care “experts” say. surgeons wear surgery. think shows much many usa people care covid handling opening economy. usa ideals go, money human life. true. able get older family members signed figured ""game"" worked(hit refresh million times bouncing around multiple sites). say there's way mother would able figure something like that. best vaccines 95% effective. covid equally effective, hundreds millions people worldwide already infected, expect see many thousands possibly millions reinfections. course makes sense. Every country innoculate citizens first move exporting. Give valid cogent reason US send vaccines abroad first? Thank god yes, got together Florida, governor decided back October municipalities can’t enforce mask mandates. Maine pretty much 100% back open. mask mandate restrictions place that, life getting back normal. can't think normal business open. Granted might use drive thru certain banks still open. Yeah, that's call body shaming. ""Isn't onus scientists prove mask mandates noticeably led decreased death counts?"" is, shown masks help worn properly? Absolutely. one going enforce proper mask wearing anyway, there's almost point mandate **could actually hurt people constantly improperly using masks.**""

Do source this? Last heard lie used early pandemic stop people panic buying masks. Besides, big worry touching surface touching face readjust mask something. First, surfaces major source infection: people touch face LESS wearing mask aren't:  !RemindMe 6 months compare excess deaths, still higher countries many didn’t say can’t replicate within GI system. said doesn’t appear first detectable site. also acknowledged shed via GI system longer course infection. again, would (not before) it’s detectable via nasal swabbing. even virus detectable asshole present respiratory system, again, concern? warrant isolating someone making wear mask virus can’t spread via respiratory droplets/aerosols? significant evidence transmission via feces?

Lmao say you’ll trust China’s judgment pretty much anyone else effective? also bold people’s doors closed enforce lockdowns, mean would help controlling virus right? could also download one copy it, print out, burn fucking death.

Your idea probably sensible though. Anti-vaccine sentiment simply rational. Anti-vaxers concerned vaccines, new old tech. arguments appeal innate notions ""natural"" emotional. never rational. Yep that’s issue. person qualified give vaccine advice, I’m shocked doesn’t see dangerous so. Except withholding vaccines exactly administration doing. Read article. US government blocking export American-manufactured vaccines Canada purchased. Pipeline required daily reading covid/vaccine curious- Yeah, never anything enforce first place. oh god y’all saying since March 2 2020 lmaoo. get creative headlines please. That’s ask.  Since COVID there’s actually mode game instead wiping earths population virus goal save population virus (as far remember many people complained game COVID started happening even though game many years, added game mode keep people happy). dunno, feel like positivity rate probably even lower 5 years ago. Seconded. way thought masks work. evidence masks work going back drcades. said stop Joe Everyman running buying many medical quality masks could. Hold on. saying people suddenly wear masks distance Covid goes away (which never)? right, political issue debate, republicans democrats can't live like completely safe Covid, everything carries element risk. live world full public health experts, step bubble realize vast majority american public gonna give ""stopping spread"" summer. tell people can't change lifestyles even get vaccine, decreasing uptake vaccine despite consistently high excellence preventing severe illness, approach seem like completely asinine. even ""dangerous spread,"" fecking matter everyone come contact vaccine, case sniffles. absolutely dispute fight, seen Florida looks like? That's incorrect policy claim restrictions bc government bc population blatantly false. like cast delusional wanting live life, one believes people ""modify behavior"" Covid even vaccine. Word advice, stop reading clickbait masks distancing forever articles, actually interact real world. Life turned South Park episode. Temperance social movement led Prohibition. I’m mocking moralization people risking getting Covid, fine going night drinking. March

You mean thought equivalent airborne Ebola, people falling death streets? Back thought fatality rate hovering around 6% instead .02%? 

Yeah, I’m sure people’s reaction would effect economy, luckily learned pretty early China lied, early-mid March hysteria would stayed early mid March. 

Again, even plague thought was, think worse businesses, forced close down, less business people’s precautions restrictions economic damage would much worse

Florida says hello Cool. choose get vaccinated. can't also send kids schools put people risk, someone vulnerable community dies disease transmitted need prepared everyone come take hard accountability look them.

Also, since matter choice, employers free terminate hire based choice. understand might always agree them, but... orders orders. They're keep others safe. Last checked, cutting back carb intake (which necessary part diet) cause extreme anxiety, rapid sweating, fevers, cold sweats, hallucinations, paranoia, etc. concerns regional variants affect vaccine effectiveness well. large impact, never know study it. fields, like cancer drug research, sharing protocols like describe, anything approved EU considered approved Canada exceptions. US typically this, say US population unique due racial diversity obesity rates. think fundamentally misunderstand body positivity movement. trying remove stigma overweight. way society treats leads poorer outcomes many facets lives. Body shaming/shunning effective way get people lose weight.

Yeah, might people Tumblr try argue obese unhealthy. powerless teenagers/young adults depths social media come close explaining prevalence obesity. I’m even sure 24 hour Walgreens pharmacy open hours- store. started trying get neighbor appointment Friday night- got lucky 6 Saturday morning. Shot scheduled go arm 12:15 PM today. enough show ""taking covid seriously"" ""being denialist"" doesnt result categorical difference per capita cases deaths. nah, 0.5-6% averaged, least according UK government's estimations. 3rd time row, YAWN! Empathy must limits, far actions go. always empathy person, also acknowledge appropriate X numbers people something them.

Now, finding limit challenge. Two people? Fair. Two thousand? No. St Patricks Day seem smart. opinion Charlie Baker making huge mistake. vaccines rolling now? Waiting people vaccinated makes sense. think Baker dropped ball handling pandemic. God hope wrong. wonderful news whole world needs ramp vaccine production. We're race variants want get back sense ""normal"". Plus, children need school many falling behind. Stop making excuses fact people little time energy due fact make slave wages country. working class fattest class reason.

We live capitalist shithole corporations constantly pushing unhealthy cheap shit us. partner working two jobs make ends meet it’s hard take time meal prep. mention fresh food expensive cheap shit shit industries heavily subsidized. Pennsylvania abolish requirement recently? Broken bones. Broken bones never healed. PCOS (very common). Depression. Injuries car accidents. Sports injuries. Working 18 hour days. Lack nutritional education. Addiction. 

Once overweight hard become normal weight. terrible cycle. lots people become obese children/teens nonidra fix it. 

There one fits solution. Encouraging lockdowns makes pandemic last longer Mate, talking this. specifics would take certain decision. you, obviously. think misunderstanding I'm taking grievance with.

What saying language used indicative certain attitude Americans seem cultures. Namely somehow ""tougher"" ""braver"" cultures around world.

We hear politicians celebrities time entire world rolls eyes it. Scotland go around telling cultures tougher, better, ""number 1"" etc. rude also obviously live easier lives 99% rest world. mean? variant already exists, already present Europe, proven escapes natural immunity AZ vaccination.  


It's gone, need anything ""similar"" occur. Europe already, thing keeps bay lockdowns. 60% population vaxxinated AZ, work (and proven single vaccine doesn't), moment relax lockdowns, variant quickly go people. 


There speculation here. SA variant exists, present Europe, AZ work it, UK uses AZ predominantly. helpful denial. Well president called virus hoax, second largest political party America refuse follow covid protocols, push agendas anti science intellectualism decades now, sewing distrust factually reported news. Exactly. People done steadily become defiant. unreasonable though US significant capacity manufacture AZ vaccine won’t let countries access it. Even though likelihood won’t end use US. Oh 100% agree. Absolutely. 

I think that’s biggest problem hear mask wearing excuses. It’s personal safety safety people around you. shouldn’t want get virus. masks protected 10% time, that’s still enough reason wear mask. Even early saying weren’t sure masks helped any. still saw doctors wearing masks, knew respiratory virus. Knew mouth nose main ways contracting disease. Knowing seemed obvious still wearing mask.  Ok remain patient, keep wearing masks socially distancing, hold enough vaccinations herd immunity, variants win. Seems based lab test tube experiments. Could different story humans. said seems likely kept mild disease infected. Also masks social distancing work. also don’t know potent vaccines (moderna, Pfizer) work them. 

So it’s definitely concern there’s lot learn becomes really concerning. believe he’s referring “pandemic” status. can’t call endemic transmission rate comes certain threshold. yea, buy taking away financial freedom fellow man fund medical care. Income result labor, forced income redistribution form economic enslavement. Haha yeah let’s take words context funny joke seem room nuanced approach sub, especially comes reopening. feel similar you, I'm comfortable indoor dining large gatherings need something store really feel unsafe going, really mind cold met people gone walks outside. feel like hard exercise caution also find ways ""normal-ish"" things even modify bit.

The thing can't get drive past bars restaurants weekend absolutely packed. Lines door, capacity restrictions, body body waiting. like months now, people think totally reasonable. ""I would like start getting back normal, maybe see friends soon"" ""what pandemic, let's go bar 5 hours saturday night"" ""lets haul whole family texas roadhouse wait 2 hours table"". really understand someone justify latter. nice. also wear required wear around family too, even get togethers far between, maybe every 3 months (my brother law keeps 'forgetting' mask get together.. try keep distance). can't wait deal anymore. piggy back on, Moderna Pfizer receive materials suppliers. house. would still bottleneck. rant, like there’s ban exports. pointing internet you’re full it. Touché COVID positive 🥲  gall man lol Plague Inc already available. called ""third world countries"" better us, shame

Which ones? also second trial come 2 dose schedule. Likely trial better efficacy mid summer recommendation would two. trial lower dose twice maybe full double vaccine needed 75% more. 

Also dont know people vaccinated 1 high dose take 2nd lower dose. 

Kids greatest expansion think treat hoarding interchangeably wasting away freezer. Hoarding saves US citizens. Wasting away freezer saves nobody. said first lawsuit requiring vaccines filed New Mexico. want go restaurant get haircut. I’m dumb. That’s thought meant, actually get appt get shot overnight hours. know, post someone else’s, meant. insanely disingenous heroin addicts comparing drinking 12 pack coke day addiction  Bruh people defiant beginning. least NY, people take seriously still. Telling ""look around"" reinforces fact people care other. Iowa Governor assumes people ""will right thing"" waits impose mask mandates lifts seemingly leisure. link also said rate much lower (&lt;17%) expected beginning Covid-19 80%)

That’s definitely one opinion. inability read observation, attack.""  ""since don’t seem able understand.""

Looks like personal attacks - please, continue rant. Inject baby  Pretty sure COVID passports also take account person recently recovered COVID well, would allow younger population participate whatever want chance get vaccinated yet nearly booked tickets conference last night. felt strange looking airline tickets again. Yeah honestly vaccine isn’t really Democrat vs Republican issue. two Republican coworkers first get vaccine, view whole thing Donald trumps personal win. Meanwhile couple democrats job weary. vaccine hesitancy really everywhere Japan track/release hospitalization numbers? show true shape pandemic. 

Their [Worldometers shows declining deaths, unless there's *massive* intentional coverup, level impossible pull functioning democracy, look like surge receding, despite population high levels immunity. 

There's going decades worth epidemiology research comparing spread differently different countries, idea much know diseases spread.  I'm listening Catholic priests moral anything. know meaning. Naw. Facts shaming. Think possible traveling reopen November? don’t care many generations removed are. benefiting original aborted fetuses much rest us. IMO it’s hypocritical pretend like big difference. want set aside convictions benefits them. want get vaccinated don’t want pretend set aside beliefs like “oh well different”. That’s great! wonder it’s different health district Virginia? They’ve “on list” county health department month now. point time science wasn’t yet settled vaccines people wary understandable. time come gone. vaccines safe effective. People still aren’t convinced despite fact vaccines probably studied vaccines human history well path antivaxx aren’t yet. time bring back science aren’t going achieve herd immunity. Covid vaccines attack largest misinformation campaign human history. attempt legitimize movement attack public health. That's fine bro, makes feel safe please try force people wear mandates go away. mind people still want wear mask mandates gone, that's try force others wear them.  

Also add, confronting people wearing masks deadly lately worth even try now. Whatever makes feel safest. Definitely stops getting sick. Hoping also stops asymptotic transmitter. No, think travel Mine sure anxiety makes muscle tight tight muscles makes hurt. Add able see osteopath RMT, bam!, pain. Oh, you’re correct. thinking Moderna. can’t keep companies straight 😂 discussion South African strain better avoiding vaccines etc. case drop seems quite steep.

I think case counts affected vaccines anywhere except like Israel maybe UK. imagine we're seeing usual pattern wide rapid spread followed rapid burnout caused combination increased population immunity via infection, increased distancing people trying avoid catching it, heavy government restrictions activity. 100%. soon saw early efficacy, used DPA force production 200m doses stage every dr office pharmacy US, could go directly arms hour FDA approval. 

What unforgivable miss vaccine rollout been. children 16 getting lung damage potentially long term issues?

It’s like ppl outright ignore data science push unsubstantiated fear mongering. work time population level.

Then why, despite decades public education programs, obesity levels continue rise? read prior comments below. explain believe risk. Keep mind purely speculation medical advances first become common practice. Obviously, old people average age life dangerous cause pneumonia likely die. Second, theory less known. People weight ESPECIALLY suffer sleep apnea extremely risk. body might younger stronger VIRUS attacks lungs don’t clear airways sleep harder fight off. Third lastly pre-existing conditions. take care treat pre-existing conditions even Covid-19. practically slim none chance die. three listed conditions don’t take care get vaccine please. others wait supply catches up. see news like start think many predictions seeing actually pessimistic. “Outdoor concerts August!” 

Why sooner? vaccines work really well disease development transmission, missing? People either vaccinated almost entirely safe, choosing vaccinated taking risk. want whole ass outdoor gatherings May lol Malicious compliance US test vaccine see works key demographics instead relying solely countries. example, US 60 million people hispanic descent UK not. variants moment current vaccines work against. Yeah, he’s telling I’m pretty, I’m cool it. entirely open now? Yeah, think POTS mono several years ago. happen viruses trouble believing possible COVID. Yeah Macron said stupid, change fact take decision. interview also said following entirely recommandations, one matter comes vaccine gets clearance not.

It's frankly amazing English-speaking media got completely stuck stupid quote, Macron got disapproved quickly, made clear vaccine absolutely safe age groups French media completely moved everybody forgot rather insignificant interview.

Did English-speaking media even reported Véran, Health Minister, took AZ vaccine live TV like 10 days after? completely built anti-British vaccine narrative simply exist media, frankly ridiculous. find quite hilarious lot old people voted brexit jab already &amp; allowed go nice holiday summer &amp; young people voted remain aren’t allowed go anywhere unless pay expensive test haven’t offer vaccine yet 

Lol Canadian living America, roots province, I'm really hopeful able visit BC summer. Well big chubby pudgy different 300+ purely personal responsibility. horrifying considering goalposts moving saying fat unhealthy making public opinion saying beautiful  hope so. CDC CNN keep talking cases. never seem mention sharp drop deaths. That’s I’m going let decide me. never want thing end. doubt upset, probably making valid suggestion. understood issue, would see common need headlines articles Brazilian variant. US screwed think lot people need come grips fact Americans never going *this* year (yes, fully understand many even handle weeks). Vaccine not, never going sacrifice much 12 months. I've taken Covid extremely seriously point, think could (or would have) done another year this

Now cases dropping vaccines rolling stunning pace, can't see reason normalcy begin return. recognize lot people going mad saying that, that's reality situation. what're planning NYC question? looking nightlife think NYC one last fully open sadly.

but travel it'll open then. I'm getting 2nd shot today already trips planned FL april july. autism. Packed subjective term I'm talking specifically people say reacted pandemic.

And far South America goes, think would like look excess deaths only. say places hit super hard covid numbers actually look bad. Nah sounds cringe inability read observation, attack.

Your sources show US unwilling give away vaccines it’s bought, fact Moderna used globally proves US isn’t banning exports.

Any company product excess obligations US export. different EU. conspiracy anymore since openly discussing stupid ideas? mean dump parade multiple variants thing current vaccine may ineffective variant... sure politician opinion rather tries follow scientific advisers.

If still believe 12 months pandemic know tell you. Yes, one one need break hold virus world. Every manufacturer pumping stuff out.

I think read Sanofi something similar Europe even continuing research vaccine. that's absolute bollocks. NPR shows 7.5% doses. 15% least 1 actual stat 10% better way! Nope! Hard pass. Everyone saying mind fucking hate can't wait over. course still follow masking mandates everywhere required fucking hate wearing thing. Honestly ""man, go out, wear mask"" effective reason I've stayed home go walk outside. go ride bike. go eat outside bar patio beer. problem opinions pulled one's ass valuable things originate forming pop health strategies.  link actual academic paper: absolutely right, although least current lockdown measures pretty clear brought spread rapidly since start January. Unfortunately many may forget incompetence vaccine rollout success. love people ignorant think ignoring basis reality *makes rational* know that. Trump Biden strongly ""America first!"", including export band vaccines. see much soft power coming crisis. «The Moderna Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinees show significantly reduced neutraliza- tion 501Y.V2 (ref. 18). Furthermore, compared global efficacy estimates, vaccine efficacy South Africa (overlapping emergence 501Y.V2) significantly reduced sev- eral vaccines. Conversely, trials seem retain efficacy severe COVID-19.» Yeah, summer places MDI going packed suck people got rug pulled close getting first shot.

I admit, 16 days 1st shot feel lot safer continue wear mask. I'm hoping numbers continue stay low time tell. Exactly. catch up. think Canadians sick Covid would agree US desperate situation. way around, headlines common legitimate concern. People want pretend there's magic bullet keeps safe COVID. yeah, young super likely die, yes, young healthy people died gotten sick. Pretending otherwise going keep safe. wondering, JJ vaccine need 1 dose? There's thing called covid tests.

Allow people qualify vaccine yet supply negative test result instead.

Otherwise people fight take vaccine someone who's risk party earlier. Vacations florida absolutely booked next months, looked hotel go Easter weekend, couldnt find one, people want get away restrictions asap. basing of? Good see Arizona getting positive coverage well good, convince lot low-information people it’s mind-controlling, government tracking, free-will destroying, population-culling, autism-causing, you-name-it vehicle turn us powerless pawns. somehow that’s legitimate theory held people would ever imagined. 

I tell anyone asks opinion 100% board take first vaccine access to. Living Canada, trust right people making best decisions us. mean higher mortality rate even Covid developed. see reason put drain society ahead support them

[link another plane you’re told emergency take care first help others. current scenario we’re opposite. Virginia, it’s done county county. live larger county outside DC got second dose teacher. She’s middle state it’s kind mess. thinking driving get shot! I'm disagreeing asking 2 doses Pfizer. want 2 too, objecting statements:

""Here hard truth: Americans individualistic lot countries would like. told young age personally responsible health safety, need tough, stand strong, get ahead. Mind business, take care own. ""

and

""When turn comes, want feel like fully armored knights battlefield, people cautiously tip toeing around. That’s expected us. That’s expected us entire lives. ""

Acting like Americans uniquely tough world. mean, people live Africa, Syria. embarrassing.

I think people would choose born US 90% countries. haven’t offered jab pay test can’t go EU guess? wish politicians would adopt Americans first philosophy jobs, like clearly vaccine supplies. house burning save kids burning house thinking saving strangers houses. taken care business ""free"" heart help others. before, comes expense people. odd since we’ve pretty strict guidelines since beginning. sure sudden shift governor. never tested released vaccine human coronaviruses before.

I'm going wait husband vaccinated really start gathering vaccinated people indoors masks, I'm really looking forward it! I'm sorry missed point post. agree. idea people voted Trump primary reason ridiculous face. Canada purchased American-made vaccines. Canada purchased vaccines made Pfizer Moderna outside US. clear everyone don’t hear Canadian government complaining US. know purchased know they’re coming from. 

It absolutely clear everyone back July/August US purchased first 200 million doses Pfizer Moderna made US. Moderna precondition receive billions dollars fund research &amp; development well prepare production facilities. Pfizer facilities guaranteed access key ingredients necessary manufacture vaccines result Defense Production Act. 

It’s fault US Canada invest research development, invest expanding manufacturing capacity, developed working vaccine wants cut line ahead US countries invested heavily. that’s thing - violent, dangerous speech already illegal. ok unelected Silicon Valley billionaires enforcing rules rather legislators job feel something amiss? Yes sure authoritarian style lockdown option opposed leadership telling people fake.

Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore also authoritarian list? (hint: answer no) don’t troll actually. It’s trolling want wear seatbelt it’s trolling want take vaccine something poses risk me. Stop trying force way life me. It’s weird backlash Germany EU buy enough Pfizer vaccines...

Not ""didn't buy enough vaccines"". ""didn't buy enough AZ vaccines"". ""Didn't buy enough **Pfizer** vaccines"". Good, people given large portion life already. seeing Florida drop 28th US mortality rate almost restrictions, surprise people becoming less less compliant. say like US country ""won"" WW2. ussr? certainly affected subreddit's perception Emmanuel Macron. seems fair enough. Things improving. Scotland running behind rest uk we've vaccinated 30% population. Exactly. supply constrained situation lives equal, vaccines going pay. 

Here’s larger point. Israel paid enormous sums get are. I’m even mad. would be? paid it.

What I’m asking angry anger directed America?  Doubts AZ prominently reported EU highly encouraging early findings Scotland England barely seem warranted mention.

Good news bring many clicks bad news. would toxic comment wasn’t ignorant. knew better, yet still chose say malice. Oh god- yeah husband doctor. completely ridiculous way redefines meaning word ridiculous. “Michael Ryan, head organization’s health emergencies program, said press conference cases risen last week every region Africa Western Pacific following six weeks falling rates. U.S. cases also show signs plateauing steadily falling February. Ryan added would “unrealistic” expect pandemic fully end 2021.” continue go gym matter reddit tells me, yes lose weight without gym, whole schedule going gym everyday keeps eating healthy thinking body every day, makes lot easier eat better. that's obesity crisis going get worse. want freedom? OK. price paid. Exactly point? Even symptomatic still spread it. think people agree you. Health experts governors alike talking changing metrics hospitalizations deaths rather cases/positivity rates soon vulnerable fully vaccinated. one person seriously overweight, telling take personal responsibility reasonable solution. millions are, talking public health societal issue addressed level. might well try solve opioid crisis saying ""there's excuse take drugs"" short sighted blame individual decisions massive, rapidly increasing percentage overweight/obese people.

I'm sure people there's way 70% population overweight/obese unless serious policy/systemic failures. problem runs much deeper folks lacking willpower. Lol yeah know. OP one talking countries. example:

"" hard truth: Americans individualistic lot countries would like. told young age personally responsible health safety, need tough, stand strong, get ahead. Mind business, take care own. ""

Do honestly believe old Scottish mum told growing weak, take responsibility actions let people roll me. know met Scottish women before...

I talking US culture. I'm talking stupid pretend tough rugged 1st world country nowadays acting like wilderness. problem actually followed advice, curve never flattened. also ""flattening curve"" bad advice begin with. Yeah, city still 1B, know people 1B can’t get appointment all. seems like lot people city driving suburbs can, none friends cars way get there. Hopefully United Center opens things pick here. not, may making trip home Indiana April get mine. PCR Tests say get sick, say may fragments Virus inside you. Wow. Congratulations!

Yup, folks group - I'm happy them. short term. effective enough medium long term, also reduce spread level masking social distancing allow reasonable reopening society. eradication even possible strict adherence observed - Australia New Zealand prove that’s possible.

Looking back 2020, countries decisive lockdowns spring broad population adherence relatively normal summers. regressed fall measures like masking social distancing weren’t maintained. 

(The UK one worst winter outbreaks, example, likely attributable scheme encouraged unmasked person dining.) Hi! saw thought -- -- hopefully get vaccine soon? Yeah I'm hiking indoors...in mall.... making plans. One thing remember is: long friends safe get vaccinated, able socialize normally amongst yourselves. me, enough make coming Summer fun, regardless much society manage fuck up!

Competent people charge vaccines (I'm talking companies manufacturing them, making political statement) know work well enough.

J&amp;J AstraZeneca improving deliveries, vaccinating 70% Spanish population sure within reach. depends course deliveries capacity administer vaccines, would optimistic. It’s EU followed Canada, large trading partners doesn’t mean you’re allies. Ah.

In case, agreed! based  kidding? he'd suspend intellectual property laws ""historic partnership"" even necessary. They're supposed suspended pandemic, guess one count? China set path global hegemony matter?  Radicalization. People see fat acceptance movement view attempt celebrate accept death disease. Anyone lose weight say this, mostly everyone works out/loses weight sticks successful sustainable plan severe benefit mental health It’s going get hard governors hold firm general mask orders June. Oh could done start? Cool. Also record number people shitting streets. want pity. Keep boarders closed country absolute shit show. 100% sure. would guess designed way. Alternative Facts. 😏 Possibly. one “standard” vaccine. Makes way likely acceptable parents. hate it. hearing loss everything muffled. wind asking people repeat constantly. Plus I’m counseling much lost facial expression. Plus clients kids spend way much time trying hear practically whisper masks. Plus live Florida it’s million degrees permanent acne sides nose. 

And double masking, caught covid anyway day getting first shot. 

I’m fucking done bullshit. really want go back office sit cube mask day long. 

This kind me. I'm office one person floor me, wear masks day. sucks bought bunch comfortable masks I'm pretty much used point.

That said, I'll happy never wear mask work again. Meh. 

The end Cold War probably qualifies. others important regional events, certainly, global impact Covid. Mexico America’s largest trading partner think take everyone else does. Everyone get's normal vaccines measles mumps except far left far right group vocal attention. think 250 million people getting everyone else go flow too. country lockdown November. restrictions, varied area still allowed travel regions. new nationwide lockdown came force 4th January. Yeah facetious, still, relieved! Treating neighbors treated us pandemic :) another example increased symptom severity reinfection. ""May"" ""almost"" sooooo scientific. country opened vaccinations people (while reserve AZ vaccines). colleagues got shot. younger folks (below 40) got fever day, recovered rapidly. I'm middle 40s mild pain hand. week later, reserve gone, waiting AZ fulfill obligations. someone sitting stash unused vaccines, going cost lives. New York population: 20 million, covid deaths 47 thousand. 

California population: 39 million, covid deaths, 52 thousand 

Florida population: 20 million, covid deaths 31 thousand. 

Somehow two states harshest lockdowns restrictions similar per capita covid deaths one literally nothing. don’t call lockdowns working, don’t know tell you. Disney world going limit visitors nothing coronavirus. Please post topic articles. Subs r/news would better fit something like this. Thanks. Check NY see crushed curve last summer nothing reopened indoors halloween ""Why lock downs worked effectively none countries avoided spiral control? wort hit places lockdowns?""

Like said, lockdowns necessary governments contact tracing right properly enforced mask wearing social distancing.

Also confusing cause effect. worst hit places choice lockdown measures properly done.

There many variables determining whether hospitals cope number patients needing ICU. lockdown, also whether people stay inside time (depends weather), average age, mask wearing compliance, number available ICU beds...

I aware scandals UK. can't say surprises me. UK politics seem gutter since Brexit referendum.

Maybe something fishy going UK, still, find hard believe politicians like announce victory end measures get votes soon possible? 

In Belgium experience politicians promised repeat lockdowns summer also forgot properly contact trace test enforce mask wearing quarantines infected people. numbers kept rising announce second lockdown hospitals nearly full.

Those politicians trying relax rules hospitals already filling due variants let in. epidemiologists advising relax rules.

Vitamin ignored Belgium helps taken systematically long period. think ivermectin already used hospitals time, treatments general improved quite lot since beginning people still dying.

I asked think China lockdown? Like said number total deaths must much higher reported.

The Chinese government exactly known shutting economy save couple lives. must done thought virus serious millions would die lock many thousands may already died shut instead dozens officially reported.  gotta say, love wearing makeup part (due WFH masks out) live crowded city to. I'm wearing big shirt saying, ""Don't worry, I'm vaccinated."" it'll thin surgical mask, N95s, I'll take people around I'm spaces people voluntarily masks like bar restaurant. suspect enough vaccinated many people going maskless around July possibly June, maybe August there's unexpected drawn slow vaccinations. also necessary. that’s necessary cutting calories, similarly doesn’t cause suffer withdrawal. feel hungry time appetite adjusts You’ll get there’s enough. can’t even get inside America essential job Whoever says “we never going back normal, better get used it.” That's part bad messaging. vaccinated people still spread it. enough studies say vaccines keep spreading, stop it, degree reduce contagious nature virus.

So people interpret lack info inverse get bad messaging. totally different risk levels. drinks (so getting super drunk) carries risk. Getting infected covid could mean serious sickness weeks, death worst case, exposing others realize you’re infected (if ever realize).

With infection rates now, bars open patrons you’d almost guaranteed infection covid hours. I’m interested helping friends get sick, I’d refuse participate that. Give know... dare they.

On serious note though, people absolute idiots. Bold assume people actually take them. Errrrr okay? fucked up, thanks shitty administration mismanagement, denying that. grateful vaccines, healthcare worker, truly hope things speed y'all there. formerly opiate addict obese person.

I found much harder quit food opiates. may cause withdrawal, also opiates staring every checkout like chocolate bars. 

Honestly, getting sober hardest part (even withdrawal), staying sober is. food addiction America stuck world designed make fail. gained bunch weight beginning april making cakes every day eating them. got 205 165 today. dieted, walked miles day hurt neck month ago I've kinda stuck 165. Factors aren’t health. Economic mental health issues make things harder. Note doesn’t mean impossible. 

Honestly don’t get people ran mile directions overall reasonable message “don’t asshole fat people, making feel bad doesn’t fix anything” 

Encourage people live healthy lifestyles without demonizing they’re yet. WW2 still much fun Soviet Union, even though won. I'm worked categorically saying long hauling due anxiety PTSD without evidence there's plenty evidence post viral sequele **not** mental health issues frankly never been. research confirming post viral sequele anxiety? Congress approved several billions study long covid came report several days ago stating long covid due organ damage physical sickness, **mental** sickness. Doctors post covid clinics saying unilateraly many patients organ damage, can't smell stuff 10 months infection, dementia symptoms sudden mental decline, unable exercise due extreme fatigue, shortness breath high HR on. multiple athletes suspend entire seasons due long covid.

It incredibly unlikely people 10+ symptoms, previously young healthy, sick bedridden, sick due anxiety PSTD.

Anxiety make bedridden. Anxiety make physically disabled. Anxiety lead POTS. Anxiety lead organ damage. Anxiety make unable exercise. pretty bad anxiety (GAD) even worst panic attacks ever feel physically disabled way. terrifying, yes, never feel long term physically disabled way long haulers do. Spring break going nuts there. super bowl surge hit yet? Yes, right deliberately covered up, response pertinent.

As change, I'd like say absolutely flagged misinformation, despite CDC &amp; guidance less year ago. hang Mickey Mouse probably okay. doesn’t seem body-positive you.. Totally agree wearing flu season out. think will. wouldn’t get hopes up. America’s really good fucking shit Huh?  haha, feels like last weeks school summer break. tolerated school entire year, suddenly done shit. Wow. left field. hope it’s true. Going full steam ahead wedding end June California. Originally 350, cutting guestlist half 175. frustrated one three venues really following rules, waiting guidance. honestly pushing normal-like wedding America call McDouble shot people line them. give voucher McDonalds get shots endless line drive vaccine site Compliance? *America?* 😂😂 risks taking vaccine well documented. someone good health, could easily conclude rather take (very small) chances serious illness (if) contract virus. would rational beyond minimal risk serious complications, consider; 1) natural immunity effective / well documented type immunity fighting future infections 2) vaccines enough time study long term effects (nor effort made) 3) vaccines documented prevent transmission; reduce symptoms infected— therefore, idea vaccinated “protect others” case 
4) known side effects vaccine undesirable, short lasting

Given known health risks covid young healthy people, versus many still uncertain implications vaccine, it’s difficult imagine world someone makes choice vaccinated— one isn’t conspiracy theory alt right racist terrorist believing microchip population control agendas, rather health conscientious person making calculated decision. 

I would encourage research roll swine flu vaccine, dengue fever vaccine, oral polio vaccine, several others, tell big pharma world governments “would never jeopardize health profits”. remember, gyms churches closed, McDonald’s liquor store stayed open. Health goal governments big business— responsibility. Try researching sides using myopic scarecrow arguments generalize side (sides divided categorized you). 

God bless. Literally response say others wear masks. question posed ""if vaccinated would still wear mask"", responded, currently that. fully vaccinated still wear mask. power mandate people wear masks wearing one community live people wear I'm outside. think important respect overweight people instead shaming jump conclusion fault they're like deserve bad things. respecting someone mean pretending obesity issue. find overweight person cute, pretty beautiful, still think eccessive weight addressed/changed live healthier life style. ""Fat beautiful"" often frowned upon imo necessarily mean ""you stay fat"". see ""you hate are"". acknowledge lot people think fat beautiful *and* healthy I'm supporting particular point view.

D wanna go India bad. Goa NYE pretty please cut important info. 
Although children infected SARS-CoV-2, get sick COVID-19, spread virus others, less 10% COVID-19 cases United States among children adolescents aged 5–17 years (COVID Data Tracker). Compared adults, children adolescents COVID-19 commonly asymptomatic (never develop symptoms) mild, non-specific symptoms.
Not high risk complications. splitting hairs. think want set kids vaccine trial go it. choose to. right I'm wrong. differing opinions comes raise children. Peace you. Cool anecdotal evidence bro. absolute number b117 cases drop though?

If cases remain constant, b117 increases, keep increasing even 100%. Let data, date, decide it’s safe travel.  Nah fuck that. moment I'm mandated wear mask, I'm Especially Morocco, parents Moroccan know chaotic healthcare system Expect better summer, large festivals months wishful thinking. countries driving it? need wear gloves home. Exactly... Obviously USAID's priorities based US foreign policy goals, they're helping CIA spy kill people lol. They're delivering life-saving humanitarian development assistance Uhhh...yeah that’s kind whole point Israeli study found greatly lowered transmission presence virus vaccinated individuals. 

Just one study empirically can’t say “it prevents it,” lay person that’s pretty good. Dude. I'm American love kinda talk really bothers me. Canada's military huge history bravery respect anyone amount research. look WW1 (while think stalemate) war 1812. 

I mind America wanting make sure vaccinate people first. Canada enemy, like, all. people like yourself. hope vaccinate fast start helping neighbors. Yes, 100%. don’t wear outside anyways top small likelihood I’m contagious Covid, outside reduces likelihood someone catching large amount. don’t give shit people don’t know I’m vaccinated, Im obligated wear vaccine. Peoples risk tolerance gone fear anxiety gone much, sucks. Oh, know. Maybe PCR test? 30-40% population (in areas) already exposed covid, adding another 10% population fully vaccinated, smaller portion likely protection (single shot) -- we've got close ~60% population form antibodies.

Let's get work March ~70% form antibodies. Yes, messaging fumbled media well.

They conflated medical/N95 masks cloth masks statements, example. 

Certain people, like Surgeon General infamously declared work.

If sub early would known many us calling bullshit honest it. 

Maybe reason fucking Jared could get hands masks... /tinfoil

The grey market STILL there. genuine 3ms supposed go legitimate hospitals organizations still buy Amazon?  really understand purpose would serve. someone wants lie status risk life, that's them, legally morally.

Once immunity kicks in, I'm parties house fellow vaccinated people. someone lies tells they've vaccinated actually come party, care? thank you! get end 2-3 months going become ""just hold another 2-3 months"" Yikes. Well want that, want virus either. guess I'll prepare worst. Glad feeling better. study holds up, I’m fine bigger people getting bigger doses *after* everyone wants vaccine get one.  getting downvoted saying currently wear mask even vaccinated. herd immunity reached wearing mask unnecessary.

The worst case scenario masks 2022 new strains cause vaccines fail.

this news India, Africa, Russia etc - knows numbers are. 180 million kids + Antivaxxers = +50% Thank you! Louder people tha back room!!

The ""journalist"" least may researched bit vaccines Spain expects receive next months, extent health system able vaccinate people. Lift lockdowns reopen whole goddamn economy already (with safety precautions like testing, frequent sanitation/fumigation, air purification ventilation/filtration, UV lighting) ramping inoculations. Lmao, totally fine first one except gnarly bruise size quarter. second one made spike fever, get migraine, get all-over body aches 36 hours, totally fine. Personal decision. think me, would. mean, children without married. legal wedding legal reasons small ceremony religious reasons really feel like need permission church children someone. actually read wrote, you’d already get that. 

But discussing 250+ guest party. new CDC director warning might fourth wave horizon.

How concerned think happening? Well, assumed that's movement sort about. However, reading more, wrong. would certainly never claim morbidly obese person healthy. would say fat-shaming problem, like discrimination bullying.

A teacher used say: ""You're perfect wonderful individuals exactly way right now, could use little work."" that's pretty much position. [If access fully stocked grocery education main barrier. people stuck buying corner stores, meaning mercy stock. store fresh fruits vegetables, buying any. 

This addressed well nutritional education. parts world though. 

If one shot needed, that's whole lot potential unnecessary deaths. one person fired debatable reasons back summer last year. ""evidence"" hiding numbers. New York hiding numbers, one seems talk that. going eradicate virus. We've successfully eradicated one virus (that affects humans) history. set eradication expectation. Oh haha said exotic Ten years ago fast food menus didn’t list calories. Two decades ago food fat free meant healthy. 

A lot issues stem decades ago food industries lied profited building decades food issues families schooling systems. agree 100% think live unfortunate time saying said inevitably gets people angry. Thank you. :) Curious kn95 mask fits properly. wife double issue kn95 issues hard breathe. Mine actually sucks breath doesn't. Thanks. hadn’t seen this. find interesting talk conspiracy theories create shadowy ""bad guy"" that's responsible problems people's lives, end bring corporations bad guys preventing improvements people's lives. I'm calling out, wanting know thoughts are. know falling conspiracy theory, least oversimplification reality, yourself? read bolded quote that's completely garbage way extrapolating high hopes future production capacity - US soon position easily produce boosters entire population month two. horrendeous! rich people stealing sublime vaccinerino! make names public! Decades ago, wanted extra large big gulp soda, would buy three large sodas. We’ve made making unhealthy choices lot convenient used be. people using cravings make choices instead brains. wear N95 *and* surgical mask working film shoot -15C weather recently well glasses constantly fogging cold breath condenses swap masks every hour gets soaking wet. bad enough working types conditions without strapping feels like wet rag face. “Some” people free time generally. 

I get feeling live bubble don’t actually interact working class people. 

You try sometime. may open eyes bit. 

Our country successfully waste I’m working class people several decades now. 

Or going argue union membership tanking good working people?

You gonna argue “right work” laws good working people?

Dual earner households didn’t start dramatically rising families decided wanted spend less overall time other.

Adding another income earner way bullshit economy propped last decades. next 30 years going see yet worse. think meant careful spread kid even get vaccinated. 
Not weren’t wanting vaccinate kid. get practice gratitude, know I'm always best it. I'm insanely fortunate roof, job, partner. live first world country access internet, clean water, decent food. 

When feel down, try cast thoughts put shoes family trying scratch survive place like Syria that's torn apart war years. grand scheme things, going movies sitting inside nice restaurant partner seems pretty small think basic ""how survive today"" matters many go through.

As future, believe science, believe work done getting us path mess. vaccine work astounding, speed quality. firmly believe even nasty variant pops current ones can't handle, we'll beat one too. Also controversial completely different reasons Thankfully studies already coming showing vaccince cause reduction transmission person person still wear mask responsible thing must 2022, next couple months pretty solid data shows fact reduce transmission. vaccine always prevent infections, excellent preventing serious illness death. So, may cases, perhaps many mild hospitalized? I'm sure though, since seen data. one arguing US help rest world get vaccinated. However, US global epicenter COVID, US government US private companies paid develop vaccines, measured dollar terms US economy far hardest hit COVID (because US rich, service-driven economy). Therefore, makes sense mostly prioritize vaccinating live US first exporting vaccines rest world. I'm convinced first step stop watching cable TV. can't cut completely, least stop watching national news channels. parents watch Fox News constantly makes angry people. Food survival need. Opiates not. Eating food literally controlled order stay alive Yeah work healthcare wear mask entire time hospital work at. never worse acne past year. Overall mind wearing mask work want skin calm fuck down! Definitely looking forward wear mask day every day. think always true. Grandad spent war POW camp loved old WW2 films.  six weeks, cases slowly dropping people getting vaccinated, you’ll say wait another couple months. on. Britain best. Fift place world. funny everyone shits america entire year gets mad us help hope so. want see look faces folks got vaccines still wear mask years after. Dumb article. makes sense project current trends say ""if increases four fold"" something countries decide themselves.

Italy, part EU distribution scheme, planning increase **more five fold** vaccines available, April so. Simply vaccine deliveries gonna increase five fold.

So, short: everything goes plan, Spain (and everyone else EU) actually able vaccinate well 70% end summer.

If everything goes plan. Hi everybody. information efficacy level Moderna one week first dose? Thank you! Yes, way knowing vaccinated isn’t. don’t want anti-maskers start lying say they’re vaccinated, reality they’re not. talked parents? Perhaps doctor’s office guidance kids parents considering return school. know change anything, going high school fall. fall, required go school physically, I'm sure going school physically matter. No, alternative fight address systemic issues led obesity crisis first place. noted earlier thread, socioeconomic status lack access affordable/nutritious food contribute.

I’m sure what. maximum impact marginal number people start wearing masks flu season. Maybe cruises never come back. that’s it. 😂 access cheap, fresh food. 

Because regulatory agencies aren’t captured multi-billion dollar mega corporations. 

There million examples. 

Have even used brain think five seconds? Thank you.

 think success stories, nothing ashamed of. Nice Lots places starting tax junk food. think studies showing makes significant difference. 

It’s frightening think normalized many restaurant meals near zero nutritive benefit. There’s big shift last forty years. People used feel guilty consuming healthy person’s allotment calories single liquid meal, little guilt behaviour like now. it’s menu, means it’s okay eat it. US export ban temporary. Give months US vaccine supply US vaccine demand, begin exporting excess capacity world. Come 2022 we'll shipping hundreds millions, billions, doses rest world. Correct. That’s masks important. keep droplets contained. Funny places near following rules. must vary. authoritarianism starts Dr. Ding gonna start selling filtered underwear prevent Covid spread farting Honestly, people that. people use drugs ""once blue moon"", people even use injection drugs way. obviously good idea, disingenuous suggest everyone easily control whether eat chocolate bar, injecting drug causes addiction long term drug problems (for people). Neither things true. everything... Except don’t studies suggest effective. would sick did, would expect be, think would odd started making recommendations based science. f-ing hope so! Don’t worry!

Learn fit properly buying groceries much less dangerous. hearing less ambulance sirens. stats bullshit. 

Housing, education, costs risen faster inflation. it’s getting worse. 

If honestly think next generation Americans going better quality life current previous generations, you’re delusional. issue approach isnt preventing deaths old people (which obviously important) also ensuring theres enough hospital beds emergencies. blunt, covid allowed run wild, beds would taken matter months whenever someone gets car accident something, would beds available them. result people would otherwise survived accidents/illness would die thats small number either.

I'm looking headline Absolutely true seems we’re getting positive news every day. Here’s May! comment perfectly sensible get downvoted. strange doom cult place become... Well decide whether want wear mask not.

I'm fine drunk driving. fine mandating masks flu season though, I'm guessing too. Someone please explain Florida California. Florida open awhile. California not. California worse off. 

I know reasons aren’t black white virus gonna virus. youre getting together households one vaccinated you’re risk. 

That doesn’t mean stay shut down. even close legal. Earth legal, idea another galaxy. I'd say least thought coming plan, government knows Flights hotel typical normal year. Guessing goes lot summer. 

It would 30% cheaper go spring I'm fine waiting. 9 nights flights 3 $3600. talking wearing mask here... throwing everything trash? 

Stop overly dramatic idiot. virus, agenda. I've wearing one nine hours day last six months, honestly get used quickly. wonder truly enforce though. see big company enforcing mask policy kicking customers out. I've heard lot people kicking screaming getting told leave due following mask policy. 

I hope get things running wild Texas people think safe. 

Also, parent, wonder school districts do. daughter's school mask policy place, hope continue enforce it. problem there’s never clear goal

What trying do? Flatten curve? Prevent hospitals overloaded? Lower deaths threshold? so, threshold? Reach herd immunity? so, know we’ve reached that? protecting vulnerable people, trying eliminate risk low risk begin with? 

So many questions, zero clarity goal ""Learning live it"", means voluntary mask wearing, plenty people Texas still do. people wearing two masks everyday, wearing masks outside nobody around, going suddenly change mask wearing behaviors everything that’s happened year, honestly think wouldn’t better locked hard enough beginning get with?

We’re close ending pandemic want throw away go weeks earlier. ""this lampshade looks kind like virus."" ok. Biden president corona over. Relax. end, deregulatory race bottom order grab vaccines first detrimental all, hardly possible blame EU this. 

The world (the Anglophone media) applauding grab vaccines. daily pissing contest get vaccines whining lot developed world profoundly distasteful.  needs help get completely totally botched winter storm handling. 100% him. got stupid got Abbott stupid. It’s worth noting localities override lifting restrictions I'm going lie.

I'm going neighboring state get mine month. 
I've ""essential"" worker entire time looking like I'm also going last group authorized get vaccine state. Neighboring state offering basically anyone, questions asked. 

So I'm going take 2 hour drive get it. 

I understand reasoning getting risk death groups first. also strikes wrong many us asked keep working people facing jobs deemed ""essential"", still put lives risk every day dealing people increasingly become lax precautions, yet shoved list people get vaccine.  ""Up 6000"" read fine print. got second shot Saturday along teachers school. lucked hard, nothing sore arm. people back today sounded like went hell. say word, ""overthink""? It’s perfectly okay. isn’t okay? economy worth 1.25 million deaths goes population more. mention long covid.

War worth millions deaths, yet happens. Why? economy Lmao Florida fully open months fine. Way better authoritarian lockdown states lol. adjust outcomes population, country like Canada significantly better United States. New Zealand, South Korea, etc much better outcomes leaned heavily following recommendations medical community.

Italy, Spain, UK? lol nice username vaccine flu. manage risk every year. 

Our response proportional threat. 

You’re making arguments bad faith it’s making look worse. Google information available outcomes every state country compare them. lot states follow recommendations well quantifiably worse states did. Even adjusting cases per 100,000 people see also kind ridiculous expect every state country turned pandemic party issue goddamn reason states defined entirely either following science following requires community participation. became party issue, every state portion population recommendations refuses follow them, real way enforce allowed entire duration. firmly believe June month things open full capacity. However don’t think festivals concerts able kick rust spin gears time get scene alive fall. Children required law attend school yes making us (my kid) go public place state opens schools 100% there's reason believe wont. Man, look...I’m reopening easing things back affect. crazy. Thank &lt;3 underestimate fast exponential spread is, restrictions think it’s likely explosive rate COVID-19 transmission R0 intact outpace rate vaccination within month two Texas doubling preventable tragedies year. Again, meaningful restrictions. It’s government stopping life going back normal. It’s majority people choosing stay safe, business making decisions, physical reality virus. simply political issue play here, it’s dumbest thing I’ve seen lifetime people think is. wonder 4 months might started, pssibly completed study teens ready present data approval. go next age group.


We need safe effective vaccines kids reach herd immunity, many adults 20 30 % depending polls swearing never get kids make 15 20 % USA population. 

Also nose spray oral vax best bet needle phonics one 💉! take trip. It’s amazing open places are. break rules. Businesses county that. Remember great used be?!? cherry picking countries though? Europe listen scientists?

My relatives England strict lockdown months looks like it'll continue June. wikipedia article situation there? rest Europe matter? Lol calm risk/reward perspective, time lock hardest. end sight, clear long would last whether would end getting eventually. possible masking distancing would amount much making sure run ventilators (which important, get wrong).

But now, see finish line beautiful future beyond it, know distancing masking really worth it. exciting, actual risk/reward calculation cause even *more* cautious sure make finish line unscathed. wonder booster time frame look like affect guys got early trial. Hey! 4 inches *and* multiple days very, cold weather! able get grandparents vaccinated Wal-Mart week Florida. Really easy process. you’ve waiting Publix, I’d recommend looking Wal-Mart immediately. No, literally don't.

Visit page sort ""deaths/1m pop"" tell Oklahoma Florida Makes wonder they'd still crack even actually true. Minnesota vs. Iowa, Utah vs. New Mexico, could go on... shouldn’t even start vaccinating people 80 everyone else gets access. dump enormous resources people already lived beyond average life expectancy, sacrificing lives younger people many years go. It’s ridiculously selfish needs stop. massively overlooked detail. occurring Florida Desantis non existent restrictions localities humming different tune Oh agree you. think snap fingers declare Covid tomorrow. think totally fair areas start prepping post-vaccinated America. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m sure TJ still thinks earth flat that’s ancient Egyptians first thought. 

Some people don’t understand science medicine changes new discoveries made. Basically, said counties allowed mandates, allowed punish anyone violates them. I’d like able mouth kiss every stranger pass street again. Given uncertainty really see issue this. provinces (ex. Alberta) already vaccinating 75+ age range next groups 65+, 18+ risk conditions, prisons, homless, supportive living workers, frontline medical received shots.

It really make difference rollout give AZ 65 Pfizer/Moderna used all. Plus Canada receiving 500k AZ next month (versus 4mm combined Pfizer/Moderna still small chunk) fucking go pandemic since last May realized high profile people weren’t staying home realized didn’t either. Oh noes! Heaven forbid would think solution frankly overwhelmingly insurmountable problem. Fuck better let hundreds thousands people die then... Florida welcomes you, Massachusetts. remember.. hospitals overwhelmed opened 100%, lot hospitals. Just. many... that’s called God’s waiting room! Lots old people take care plenty resources it. 

In words, capacity handle case spikes, people lived. sure hospitals handle load. 

Good luck. thinks winter storm wipe enough people TX, let's spread COVID. Flu deaths 2019: 22,000

Covid deaths year: 500,000

Why comparison keep getting made??  live state never mask mandate. Probably 60% people wear anyway. wonder many people TX wearing regardless that's percentage. good excuse give vaccine younger people spread faster anyways. Agreed making sure hospital stayed capacity unsure quickly virus going spread. never promising could go back normal life. can’t wait new vaccine resistant strain come socially distance forever isolation makes finally kill  kid fast food considered expensive rarely got it. However since mom didn’t want sister feel left experience things American kids got one happy meal each. remember mom taking us work (seamstress) daily summer couldn’t afford day care. took us McDonald’s lunch didn’t lunch could pay happy meals. sister gave one bite burgers.

My mom never near obese almost 5’8” 130 lbs average dad also never overweight. don’t get excuse food deserts eating fast food it’s cheap. 

My mother worked two jobs thirty years. full time job part time one day slept helped clean sweep woke mop floor. dad unemployed 8 years worked butt got job post. would pick us school cook dinner waking 5 meant feet 12 hours day finally sat dinner 7. many excuses helping cause arguing extremes... contention masks worth even saves one life, would rightly chastised (and would among chastising). better argument deploy every tool thought may help attempt keep hospitals capacity, barely managed do. hospital capacity much issue, see problem different states taking different actions reflective political residents. concern businesses opening back I'm sure schools close behind kids packed together classes hallways masks. parent kid school (currently remote learning) amount vigilance part going protect may bring home yet homeschooling really viable option. Might worked y’all jackasses actually followed protocols back then. didn’t, half million people dead thing drags on. Meanwhile China opened months ago fine....because people actually listened gov told cautious conference August. better then. I’m sorry reality evolution inconvenient you. 25% 61%? kind error bar makes conclusion ... shall say ... bullshit? Fucking idiot. Yes, bad thing do. it, legal moral responsibility it. Well Texas effect two hours. I'm making comparison early tell.

I'm simply asking case explosion is. mask mandates prevent cases, Iowa removed mandate, either Iowa best voluntary mask compliance country something else happening. I'm conservative I'm fan ending mask mandate matter public health, opening businesses something support. I'll keep masking socially distancing vaccine kicks in, smart people same. Russia admitted excess deaths 3x normal too. attribute covid... understand now, I'm afraid we're wasting breath. Well, Texas going full Future aka *Mask Off*, almost certainly fewer people come Fourth July. Here's idea you: maybe Twitter *legally required* allow kind speech platform, maybe also still bad become arbiters truth. like staying open flu season 2019... oh wait... life risks people die time? revelation! Florida already this, months ago, also basically ended restrictions across board. still see people wearing masks isn’t super common. Inside grocery stores bit moreso. higher density city, people complying rural areas back 2019 been. 

In terms many people tested positive, Florida basically exactly middle pack. masks, social distancing, indoor dining, things, you’d expect opposite true states like California well, Florida horrible. it’s exactly opposite.  Anal pain And? Yes, see fat people everywhere. make okay.  People rejecting communist mind control device? Shocked! COVID flu? Makes sense, chief. Man can't wait go movies again. eat out. park. family gather birthdays. friends come play D&amp;D in-person. get back normal. No, actually don’t. tried didn’t help therefore doesn’t work pain. even tried 2 chiro’s sure. dry needling temporary pain relief (a days) don’t find value it’s fleeting. also tried acupuncture. worked 2 times stopped, therefore concluded placebo effect originally pain reduction. regular month visit osteopath RMT keeps pain reduced manageable month, therefore work. added bonus I’m pumping body full narcotic pain killers. reason Heath insurance benefits cover them, hint, it’s work. Source Japan Korea worst flu deaths per capita? Exactly. complex get it. “We haven’t eliminated covid never restrictions, ease restrictions it’ll apocalypse. “

I feel cognitive dissonance think obesity also pretty important comorbidity. point year people likely won’t even self isolate quarantine virus. anyone think people cold even flu (flu bad still) quarantining s*it covid? course not! Sorry got carried away. bad Yeah way people vaccinated changing nothing. RemindMe! 2 months considered hoping one state line North Atlanta pull discarded dose. like getting new xbox PS5 lol. gotta quick lucky. I've made least 10 family/friends appointments.

my uncle called asked could help get one. 5 minutes later appointment made Friday him. luck one mega-sites happened release bunch soon got phone lol. show claimed Europe whole listen scientists? said UK didn't. going tell I'm equating UK Europe whole? certainly say that. 

you look per capita outcomes responses comparing United States every European country. United States worse vast majority European countries containing spread. literal quantifiable fact. 47 countries, United States worse spread 40 them. ones typically dense small countries less likely contract become seriously ill still spread it.
Please research I. I’m except grocery store thing. love taking little kids grocery stores. make shopping even pain ass. uncertainty, England published vaccine roll outs pfizer AZ yesterday Scotland days before. show AZ extremely effective preventing hospitalization contracting covid. good begin with, unless absolutely necessary.

So people pushing resume war swim around pandemic time.

I'm simple guy, think that's good look. Seems murderous me. RemindMe! 2 months end well texas vaccines going great rate...I support Abbott ""Who knows ever get vaccine?"" 

I'm glad guys eating words. 

Normality ahoy. 200 times haha. Don’t mean brag. know they’re blocking middle seat wrong before? Even governor removed ability enforce mandate individuals, people continued wear masks.

So sounds like people made risk calculations behaved accordingly. uncertainty? addition, we're already seeing, many American states loosen spring Oh I’m saying lifting restrictions today right thing do, mean think would’ve less push clear goals set much earlier (soon first approved vaccines) Assuming everyone able get one quickly I’m told varies person person. first one felt like arm hella bruised, second one laid good day half. co-workers opposite - first one terrible, second one fine - reaction either shot. Either way, symptoms shouldn’t last past 48 hours. completely fuck educate yourself!” child moonlighting parents 80s 90s say poor excuse. mother held two jobs majority life one day off. dad woke 5 came home cook dinner meant didn’t get sit 7 pm give take 30m. still ate home cooked meals every night. dishes daily helped sweep every weekend mom mopped. parents never got break raised healthy kids good food fast food considered expensive.  believe incorrect. Average flu deaths per 100k

Japan 32.07

Korea 16.34

US 10.59 yeah elder population vaccinated key hospitilizations didn’t nationwide lockdown: 

Someone another state bordering Melbourne could come spread Says who? guarantee Texans fine mask mandate staying pandemic I've lived Texas better part 40+ years. big state wildly different politics cultures depending region state in. circle friends even immediate area necessarily indicative feelings state whole. again, polling data back claim? know point asking evidence something became controversial. “we” mean GOP literally real world results demonstrate mask mandates impressionable impact COVID cases. take much google search find comparisons various states differing level mask mandates see less restrictive mask mandates generally matter end result - cases generally equal fact, states less restrictive mask mandates lower numbers states do. guys twitter account comparing states results cases months. worth read actually think mask mandates move needle much low ask, sure mean really anything.

Further, reducing transmission viruses already community ideal either. means weaker immune systems road. going end bad Thanksgiving spike. Christmas spike. Super Bowl spike. could get n95 mask protects you. haven’t clubbing since pandemic started. I’ve bars though. I’m willing sacrifice folks get us back normal - yes. want frame way. got news you, feel way understood you’re advocating for. wonder common masks pandemic, they'll common courtesy flu season like many Asian countries they'll forgotten next.

Other diseases kill people too, think be... virus's peeter approx 18 months anyways. Lookin June 2021. can't bet black roulette wheel say ""time tell right call""

Bad unnecessary risks still bad unnecessary risks even get lucky. Congratulations.

I really happy Texans. I’d argue reopening guidelines set states direct result lack reopening guidelines federal level. Oh ok. agree Also exposure bugs. I've heard said allergies Africa. sounds like bold claim much exposed birth nothing new coming in

India Pakistan rough area. given hand sanitizer kid gloves. expected confront filthiness day one 

Also region horseshoe bats carry coronavirus variants they're largely unaffected well everyone living near cave full bats every antibody need kids still enrolled school district still happen. 

The ones we're discussing de-enrolled previous school district may enrolled somewhere else not. state work speed data has, lot independent schools (or even rural school districts) slow provide new student enrollment data. school districts ask ""next school."" unless another school within state school district, often hard consolidate (i.e. junk).  

As calls Vs. letters, state may even *current* phone number file. Even lot letters return-to-sender missing kid's parents moved (both inter-state state). everyones take masks staying around awhile? think s.m.r.t people (like us) continue wear public setting grocery store, gas stations, etc.

Once I'm fully vaccinated masks go bonfire Damn. scheduled 2nd today, thinking maybe opted earlier appointment 2PM... eradication achieved, nations kept protected closing borders everyone completed mandatory two week quarantine, prevents superspreader events occurring removes concerns inaccurate testing. avoid people sick 2020? Yes, did. Texas entered chat. sars mers fuuuuulllll blooooown covid ""Just 2 weeks flatten curve"" Nice. Give one. 


NAH, young healthy. punsihment, turn summer. lucky anti-vaxxers people virus kills even chance get vaccine.

Nobody died D-Day getting vaccine either. crazy CA population still supports him, good amount want even restrictions reason.

I bad gut feeling masks going around long, long time here. Hopefully I'm wrong. still allowed wear mask makes feel safer. Somebody super optimistic. live Texas think we're fucked hope right. see spike hospitalizations soon eventually decreasing vaccine quantity actually meets demand.

This confirms I'm going avoid public already do. I'm willing go back grocery stores 50% mask rates. way. think there’s anything wrong that? even little bit suspicious? Love it, can't wait finally restrictions Free Last!! Free Last!! Thank God Almighty free last!!! completely feel this. I’m totally fence lockdown. itching end, extremely worried we’ll regress jeapordize summer. keep we’re general population able begin getting vaccine think we’ll fine. really feel like next weeks last hump summer, I’m worried might fuck home stretch. area leaders supposed ***LEAD***. follow behind constituents constituents, politicians constituents, infectious disease experts. cool wear mask still fine means deaths/hospitalizations continue decline. suppose time tell, think right call make. Uhh... I'm sure know interpret data... agree, need clarity goal could expect able safely lift restrictions. massive failure leadership. 

But article interviewing experts virology, public health, infectious disease warning research shows risk another surge transmission death restrictions lifted now. aren’t setting goal, job to, suggesting holding onto restrictions bit longer could save lives. 

I don’t think disregard people misinterpreted 2 week quarantine definitive fix. Outdoors transmission extremely rare. really problem beaches open. Virus going virus. always going way.

That sold last March, definitely sold bill goods. stop pretending original point lockdowns. literally admitted lied there’s need keep defending first world nations Japan Korea far worst influenza deaths per capita them.

If masks effective effect two places usage cultural norm (SK Japan). 2 nations show lower influenza mask usage common decades.


Instead 2 nations show decrease influenza deaths actually much worse non-mask usage nations. saying one state locks another didnt locked state opens borders, happens someone asymptomatic super spreader comes in? false negative covid test? Western part state isn’t bad. Somewhere around half percent allegheny county vaccinated day That's Florida shut testing sites genomic testing detect new variants.

Independent whether Texas right thing lifting restrictions, think many people across board would placated every state clear reasonable metrics criteria lifting every restriction
 
We argue “reasonable” is, don’t understand people okay metrics criteria lifting restrictions majority states

“Playing ear” “it’s safe say so” doesn’t seem like effective public health messaging something really cool immune system working something out. Like there’s whole separate intelligence inside whose sole function helping you, rarely notice working. every surfaces you’re like “hell yeah go little T-cells Memory B cells.” continue wearing long want. absolute shittiest thing protecting *them*. mask much protect you, help prevent spreading virus caught it.

Bunch assholes. first pharmacy state get it, adding chains plus mass vax centers supply increases :-) yet see actual enforcement even mask mandate. happening. Quit facetious. know fact I'm showing countries people whiny little babies, put grown pants locked solid handful weeks, social distanced like anyone would basic human empathy, got shit back normal ASAP.

Anti maskers anti vaxxers specific locale culture. Egocentricity short term greed kneecapped greater societies throughout wikipedia article situation there? rest Europe matter?

You know, nothing utmost sympathy folks live totalitarian regimes restricted internet access. I've recently linked copied resources help users China India can't access ""politically sensitive"" pages sites regularly take granted. Really puts things perspective helps realize privileged am.

I'm really upset hear access Google Wikipedia. :C hope things get better soon. Sending love blessings~ fact another preprint today showing CD4 CD8 cell response remains intact across common variants. YEEEHAWwwwwww! 
Couple years ago considering states move. Texas list. Glad go there. say weeks ago doesn't? New zealand says hello. Iceland says hello.  people want. government represents people. stop anyone wearing masks still want to. really change anything except incrimination wear masks. wife traveled Europe previous three years twice 2019. We're ready GTFO.  There's explaining low deaths though... Clearly Japan get hit hard West virus. Maybe luck, knows Greg Abbott opened Texas soon caused skyrocket cases. failed then. 


Greg Abbott failed every response far COVID even failed power outages winter storm response it.

 
Greg Abbott fail this. GOOD LORD SOMEONE HELP US TEXAS No, officially. majority california still purple tier, means indoor dining.

However, restauranteurs declaring ""to hell restrictions"" opening full capacity defiance order, state fuck-all stop them. gyms, smaller movie theaters too.

The lockdown paper looks quite bit different lockdown real life.

Really things can't right California go sporting event ride rollercoaster. Lol 0 chance states outside conservative ones lift mandates around May. 0 chance People always say state fully reopens, yet always end following exact curve states regardless restrictions. Removing mandate absolutely gives anti maskers ability stop wearing masks public places. People obviously still choose wear them, mandate necessary bit longer shortest duration whole mess.   March hopefully opposite last March learned lesson this, roughly half country tell 2+2=Green straight face make wedge issue it. Agreed. Remember last may/june Texas reopened early, declared huge success, close blew face? Texas doesn't. thought HEB already stopping maskless customers danger employees something? You’ll reason infringe other’s rights couple months I’m sure   ever reason people lose dang minds forced eat favorite restaurant’s food dinner table instead someone else’s

Some people, yes. someone's putting lot money pockets companies like DoorDash Uber Eats, everybody. personally could go another year without stepping foot reastaurant, I've always preferred eating home. Wearing mask small harmless action. need everyone save lives. People dying flu still crisis. Sad apparently see saving lives bad thing. Lack social distance indoors risk factor. Good. locals going park every weekend inflate crowds bad way. parks managed open actually seeing rise profitability due fact smaller crowds park means people spend less time lines time midways, buying food, drinks merch.

A talk able (enthusiast event) president Texas amusement park month ago mentioned even though attendance dead summer, managed make amount money normal summers. Everyone wants play doomsday card, Florida way long time it’s numbers worse NY CA. Everyone thought cases would spike celebrations Tuscaloosa, dropped like rock. Let’s wait see saying it’s horrible decision. goes well, hopefully states same. adults. year. can’t stay locked forever.

I Florida right great everything open even restrictions.

It comes personal responsibilities. wear mask time, wash hands, keep distance able live relatively normally (restaurants, parks, etc). Even vaccinated, continue while.

I avoid crowded places people don’t respect basic mask wearing distance. stopped going businesses don’t care masks.  **Time abandon hygiene hypothesis: new perspectives allergic disease, human microbiome, infectious disease prevention role targeted hygiene**

Basically, says microbial exposure (what call ""Old Friends"") crucial strengthening immune system. provide examples pets home, raised farm, lots siblings linked less allergies.

The authors point hygiene hypothesis misleading word, hygiene public speech different hygiene academics meant. actually point unlikely exposure viruses makes us stronger, evolutionarily speaking. hygiene hypothesis *academically* meant sanitise everything point sterile, microbes actually good! people read ""hygiene hypothesis"" like ""hygiene bad!"" case: want dirt, lot, necessarily want exposed pathogens.

I'm sure there's it, comprehensive literature review found. @ everyone wearing mask 9 months ago Fauci said don’t work   We've turned stupid mask thing political football. 

It literally one mitigation mechanism absolutely zero economic impact.  Paying $100 hour appointment feel placebo effect worth you? suppose much money worry handing much cash then. New Jersey, appointments gone seconds/minutes. entire state pretty much eligible since everyone lying smoking mean many times need happen? Honedgly id wait vaccination spike J&amp;J one removing restrictions en masse like Finally someone balls obviously necessary feel side effects tried engage moderately strenuous activity, turned way difficult expected.     may HAHAHAHA 

""if stay home corona 2-3 weeks"" I've always thin rail, eat low carb, IR would still bomb OGTT. avoid making condition worse underlying genetics never go away. seriously couldn’t wait 2-3 months something like this? Good. year this. God remember reading news coming China wasnt going well trump saying nothing flu.... doesnt take genius realize dont hear China flu.

That's knew gonna go shit. Missing context presumably people guidance Archdiocese still get vaccinated mRNA vaccines avoid moral compromise. Short sighted course due limited supply vaccines, eventually one supply goes up, non-issue. research cause I'm curious rationale (not agree it), apparently J&amp;J vaccine uses HEK cell line (originated elective abortion Netherlands) production vaccines whereas mRNA used cell lines test vaccine. state provide context ""rational"" explanation J&amp;J vaccine morally equivalent Moderna/Pfizer vaccines many Catholics. thus Archdiocese's warning, since theoretically better vaccinations available sight Catholics concerned compromising morals get vaccinated. Good. year this.  know thats still good right? Also held restriction another month two less people would die one stopping people wearing masks put another couple months

This saying every month year.  I'm okay *you* wearing mask every flu season end time. Nothing idea people consider small harmless action save lives makes mad. mandate crisis passed. There's difference people thing making thing *mandatory.* would removing mask mandate ""learning live it""? Sounds like deciding pretend exist. social distancing. Doubly bad indoors.  Summer starts mid-June ends September, surge happened late spring majority summer season saw noticeable drop cases. Cases started rising October another full-on surge occur late November lasted late January, It’s ongoing concern- reportedly (links follow) SA variant slightly resilient common strains, NY California strains *reportedly* better able evade vaccine induced defenses. 

SA: (old news) Francisco variant *allegedly* likely put people hospital may resist vaccine: *ongoing* alleged unsettled inferences data- settled science ones saying are. epidemiologists watching relevant data; finding cause concern new strains ""People still alive there.""

Uh...a lot arent   Iowa lifted mandates weeks ago, decline continued. Florida Georgia open since May, decline continued. story South Dakota. story Montana. list goes on.


Vaccines rolling quick, J&amp;J game changer. states well 50% 65’s least 1 shot in. Oh misread that. I'm sure he'll shoot anything local past.

I’m confused think comment doesn’t include “people”. I’ll go controversial take. 

“Long covid” isn’t much diagnosis umbrella term million different things. percentage things curiously mimic symptoms anxiety. 

I’m saying, wouldn’t surprising symptoms mysteriously disappear event basically means “covid over” person symptoms. problem solve itself. contagious strain also means people acquire immunity via infection faster. much longer quarantine then? Yes agree you. Hopefully vaccinations variants administered greater scale, texas effect starts spreading Speaking of, Texas still dealing power issues water crisis? Correct, guess. charge process deciding gets researched. Mostly, people fund scientific research get decide gets researched. United States, mostly Congress funding coming Executive Branch well. things get control, it'll late shut stuff back without massive costs human life

If decision based facts, science numbers would reopened everything instead gone gradual reopening process could carefully monitored. Sadly based facts, science numbers. Instead decided play big gamble people's lives.  Apparently conspiracy theorists one rung Q--a--n--o--n people disagree dangerous let run wild massive, front-page COVID news source silencing criticism them

Good know, Mr J***s.  it’s enough people’s homes made uninhabitable burst water pipes, get COVID too. Sounds (R)ight. I'll right wrong. 

Virus keep rapidly retreating. NJ sucks too. Even seniors! It’s early 100% lift mask mandates Texas. Open restaurants, whatever, pandemic isn’t quite yet masks make lot sense still. People need wear masks months come, frustrating. Hey fellow Texan. son play game called ""spot idiot"" driving look people alone cars masks on. great fun helps pass time. We're going back normal, told us hundred times. find statements WHO, Gates Foundation, CDC, etc stating we're going back ""normal"", that's they've calling new normal. media keeps saying ""normal"" like carrot stick masses give get experimental injections. care anymore, masks everything back 100% next week state /dab sure sound optimistic finish line.  Well difference vaccine part equation, apples apples.

I personally conflicted, hesitant cautious things reopening already continue routine I've isolating, honest I'm curious results going could better we're expecting. Live free die, New Hampshire state like seatbelts. argument 6ft 15 minutes rule. based common knowledge science.

Do realize 500k us dead, variants gaining steam, people Florida, live, still like nothing happening? Businesses 100% open. 

Americans know better want strong self-protection largely own. Mask wearing falling favor, many people don’t want kind vaccine, get sick lose jobs, asses.

So no, won’t find lot support watering vaccines save infections, especially vaccines flow like water matter months. already year!

That's absurdly high barrier considering see look window overpriced high-rises. else? Rent goes every year.

This city living hell car, especially also family take care low income. Yes. miss able breathe air fellow humans. natural thing I've always taken granted. children 20, even 16 aren’t dying covid false, children died.

This dumb absurd attempt dismiss verified patterns infection rates pointing outlier anomalies. You’re ignoring science.

Ppl 20 aren’t susceptible virus anything close rest population children unaffected also false. 

Use head try interpreting actual data known regarding infection rates age. getting MIS-C, CDC states still learning idea kids get don’t. 

What per capita rate children getting children hopefully recover, die (even without MIS-C), don’t even know full long-term effects children except may need long term coronary care.

Again, rate children getting this? 1 10,000 1 1,000? Please provide data frequency children affected. statements children unaffected won’t die like people outright ignore data science sound informed really ignore data points don’t fit beliefs.

What science data suggesting ignored? I’ve offered actual data shows minimal impact children are. you’re claiming data wrong please provide something support claim. Till you’re nothing trying create disinformation attempt sensationalize example lung damage that, example. 

Again, Could please provide data shows frequent children developing health issues due like covid adults don’t know true long-term effects we’re exactly long term timeline.

Why even mean? suggesting policy based “we don’t know” ignoring science known?

Why, end goal suggesting suggest ignore science/data available formulating move forward virus? understand asking right now? know long term issues children. 

We know exactly infection rates, deaths effects covid population age grout. data utilizing push fear covid you’re advocating for?

Please explain lung related? Probably not, potentially serious resulting long term issues death? Yes.

Again, data using? simply looking stoke fear?

Please explain lack verifiable evidence support whatever you’re advocating for.. Wut amount disposable income available increase since 80s.

Did mean say disposable income?

Because mean much. Discretionary income number using here. Canadian 20s, expect get first dose June. I've feeling way. know Newsom weird spot gets criticized ends, people think open ASAP, end freaks anytime lift restrictions, feels like enforce restrictions.

Personally, start pandemic told preventing hospitals overwhelmed. knowledge, hospitals actually overwhelmed (though get little dicey places Dec.) overwhelmed then, cases hospitals plummetting, still need restrictions?

Combine fact plans full reopening ever (literally lowest tier yellow, green tier), living California feels hopeless like said. Especially seeing states gradually lift restrictions.  problem reduced effectiveness means people get vaccine still get virus. happening higher frequency increases likelihood virus develops immunity vaccine. antibiotic resistant strains bugs today people stop taking antibiotics feel better, rather taking duration prescribed. bugs develop resistance time. That's currently huge problem. many antibiotics covid vaccines covid vaccines similar stain developed resistance vaccine likely effective vaccine many many months. 

Covid long term problem. need long term solution. can't weaken long term solution short term results last. risk high. Risking vaccines effectiveness could disastrous pointless non-lockdown lockdown months. I’m 18 already waiting list sign area. soon opens 1B here, sign vaccine. talk COVID-01 COVID-18 anymore, we, smart guy? know might seem like dumb question point think know answer want reassurance. 

If i'm vaccinated, friend covid 2 months ago, there's risk us hanging without precautions right? averaging 70k new cases per day, 1.2 million doses vaccine per day. That's 17:1 ratio. way virus spread enough cause another surge. Numbers continue go important areas like hospitalizations deaths.

We -may- see higher ""case numbers"" percent positivity likely decrease continuously well. 

Obviously virus still present people still terrible outcomes, suggest another ""surge"" coming just.. well.. wrong. Even cases go up, old high-risk people getting vaccinated, *by far* likely end hospital capacity die. vaccinations, we’d still far better fall.  got first dose New Year's Eve.

Not frontline healthcare worker, WFH since last April, work hospital... time, NY allowing hospitals vaccinate healthcare workers going start fining letting vaccines sit fridge, hospital went nuts vaccinating every employee. 92% us division got vaccinated according one chart saw. Canada needs step means majority. Unless trying claim count Americans vote. know dust think do. believe know less reasons covid prevention think know. 

I never claimed anything 15 minutes, direct criticism someone else. 

As 6 ft rule, recommendation intended avoiding larger droplets, dont stay aloft 30 seconds. Additionally, recommended people stay shared public spaces half hour avoid breathing enough suspended aerosols exceed scientists believed threshold viral load cause infection. So, hold secret viral spread overlooked. 

I really dont go attic flashlight already knew continual lofting dust due thermal circulation. one way keep dust aloft kicking floor one way. mention one way imply ways.

But seems must repeat myself. Virus particles sticky unlike dust particle, land, become airborne mere thermal circulation air. AC helps virus particle stay aloft much longer undisturbed air 3 hours virus sticks surface, eventually become inert. Chiropractors crack shit back like, ""I lower credit score too.""

They're basically glorified snake oil salesman. trust damn thing say outside something specifically involving spine. sub. :) Yea dance zones thing super weird- definitely hoping eases time wedding.

Family Scotland scheduled June first vaccine, 12 weeks later second dose. they’re 35-40 age bracket. assume younger people might wait even longer. European countries might even longer looks like. think much larger psychological issue people realize. sure really fixable either many levels. much giving shit involved become overweight. large need diet bit actually obese people. know many people tacked 50lbs life lost it. Sometimes life hits need bounce back.

If someone allowed care little health become 300lbs+ think COVID little impact changing minds. think anything would outside death large portion them. America point accused fat shaming whatever offensive thing apparently said even trying address talk epidemic.

No, killing causing extraordinary harm society whole. facts.

""The impact obesity overweight U.S. economy eclipsed $1.7 trillion, amount equivalent 9.3 percent nation's gross domestic product, according new Milken Institute report role excess weight plays prevalence cost chronic never herd immunity. could evaded? ""In spirit brave forefathers Alamo..."" I've seen, people still wearing masks. Unless, maybe, they're fully vaccinated. makes Ted happy.  issue simple exposure virus - seem dealing virus simply potent inhaled vs ingested. really sure would directly test without actually exposing people controlled experiment. seeing viable virus surfaces really tell anything virus needs properly inhaled.
 
The contact tracing epidemiology really able answer question though. say seems like fomite transmission rare - see people getting sick food delivered, also fomites serious risk, bad mask hygiene improper mask re-use would making people sick. opposite - even thee laziest, marginal mask behavior seems huge protective effect. would case used mask contaminating surface place on.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  rights kill people breathing them? rights 500,000 dead? get downvotes every time make observation; obvious answer ..... make air filter box fan couple hepa filters tape clear air tens times hour  Oklahoma Florida highest death rates... worries. April resurrection month. Book discount! agreed upon stance based actual hard data people banned. think restrictions *do* make difference, much we'd like, mainly America people tough time following restrictions en masse. So, indoor gatherings, poor mask usage, etc still happening. countries people take restrictions much seriously, work lot better. 

But that's argument get rid restrictions altogether, probably effect, even meager, still saving lives. mean simple google search timeline coronavirus [insert country] answer you. really TX (or US state) wanted to, could opened back 100% capacity May 2020. government data freedom choice available two examples gave. 

They (or sizeable chunk citizens) clearly made decision go things differently. Interesting. Canadian figured vaccines going ramp Q2 similar ours. Looking schedule, almost appears like April-May drop bit. done sometime early June maybe, based schedule, Canada maybe early July. less difference expecting. ""Oh hey survived global pandemic plus side learned way help save lives future lets ignore lessons instead pandemic total loss hurt people's feelings""

what? Yeah, same. Wearing mask bother all. wanna hang family go restaurants. think residents Melbourne would like strong word you. cases dropping too? like ending sad war movie (think SPR) - know coming towards end, cavalry there, yet know character going get popped right he's free clear.

Vaccines distributed, need another month two campaigns hit critical mass, instead get? Shit like this.

IIRC positivity rate 10% mandates lifted - that's reassuring. Stay safe, Texans. need another year, months give time distribute vaccines. makes sense good last year, give now, case numbers bad 2020 vast majority yet vaccinated. We're home stretch! Well, surely replace freezing weather headlines (i.e., crazy electric pills, needing weatherize stuff, electric grid reform, providing aid texans).  Fauci floating indefinite masking distancing 2022 fucking dumb. Biden suggesting things might normal “until Christmas” dumb too.

But opening fully vaccine widely available. logical ramp.

Goddamn, stuck two extreme positions. There’s nuance critical thinking American politics anymore. FUCKING LOL CALLING SOMEONE FLAKE POSITION ""WAH WANT WEAR MASK WAHHHHH""

God tough. want run back alley. actually think better stay inside. piece cloth bring knees, wind might kill you.

Also ideas presented??? whole argument ""WAHHH DON""T WANNA SOMETHING PEOPLE WAHHHHH""

That's idea. fucking dumb want hear ideas either. I'm well aware that, dickhole. seriously implying getting nice steak delivered house good getting one straight restaraunt kitchen, fucking mind.  2000 trucks cross eurotunnel everyday? starters. 

Where uk net food importer? cringe? crazy you? Look around Dad’s 40s 50s. good argument reopening businesses cases dropping.

There good argument removing mask mandate yet. We’re literally handful months everyone able get vaccine want it. hurt retail businesses people can’t get vaccine yet avoid stores without mask policies. without government backing, low paid workers even anti-mask crazy deal with. Please report comments rather engage. Permanently vaccine 6 months ago? Love it, happy..can't wait celebrate. lot people know cannot stomach another spring summer cooped let alone another year. Eventually people going get tired getting pandemic not.  would also pretty expensive virus allowed replicate developing world spit unforeseen variant fucks everything right back up. 

Not sure odds even would be, everyone's interest tamp ASAP. think still largely symbolic, doubt we'll see stores taking signs yet, outside large cities never see people wearing mask anyway.

It's still gonna come to, want responsible wear mask, everyone else continue wear mask. likely win lottery variant completely dodges vaccines show next year. reason still experience pain

Chronic pain. name. chronic. first word. one always there. end, Political decision. really comes whether people Texas elected office feel worth saving additional lives not. Although Americans say listen science, there's huge swath voters feel otherwise. minds everyone equal, deserving fair outcomes, especially disaster like pandemic. Nowhere. someone lived Texas whole life, let say this:

Fuck Greg Abbott entire fucking administration. nice, please. report rule-breaking comments rather engage. thread removed user banned. also got look fact wearing mask remind people future 2020-2021, time many people want forget move from. might safe still 1/8th chance spread someone else compared someone vaccinated. people's safety. Good job op! makes angry people, life continued usual whole time. House parties all. Meanwhile I’ve living like hermit year now. think people deal August, HUGE surprise.

Last year, people couldn’t even deal two weeks. direct conflict ""mask wearing social distancing"" ""opening up.""

If dedicated diligent pandemic response, many parts society open safe, distanced manner. However, careful reopening ***must*** coupled masks social distancing reasonable, scientific standards.

The reactionary right somehow made debate complete shutdown versus complete reopening, in-between. mistake obviously pandering culture war fighting since Obama elected. y’all think happen Texas cases
/ hospitalizations? argument comparing heroin addicts sugar addicts “insanely disingenuous.” trying point studies strongly suggested otherwise. see happened April May places didn’t take COVID seriously tried rush reopening caused cases spike? United States whole epitome rushing things prolonging it. New Zealand , East Asian countries basically done COVID months took seriously beginning. talking New Zealand Australia?

I impression several states within US lot Europe listened scientists. going them? reported comment spreading misinformation COVID19 subreddit certainly meltdown Massachusetts Republican governor still ton restrictions. Still mask mandates, still 50% capacity outside restaurants, still 6 people per table. Still amusement parks, bars, festivals, outdoor events, etc. literally opening everything up. opening things up, Republican governor well. accurate comparison fly state 3.2 million people throughout 56k square miles! troubling thing none health messaging governments ever says lose weight. dumb absurd attempt dismiss verified patterns infection rates pointing outlier anomalies. You’re ignoring science.

I'm ignoring science. Science says children die Covid, MIS-C long term effects yet fully know actually 20 aren’t susceptible virus anything close rest population

I say were, glad per capita rate children getting this?

I'm mobile formatting already annoying, I'm going sort statistics you. welcome fairly easy google searches find CDC information (or plenty health publications) legitimately science data suggesting ignored? I’ve offered actual data shows minimal impact children are. you’re claiming data wrong please provide something support claim.

You actually provided data comment chain said ""Nonetheless, children age 20 aren’t dying covid."". Regardless, I'm claiming data wrong, claiming you, person chain said nothing children die wrong. factually whether ""anomaly"" have. Whether data point small still you’re nothing trying create disinformation attempt sensationalize topic.

Uhhh what? even attempt create disinformation? Nothing said factually incorrect. ""an attempt sensationalize topic"", started entire conversation. made general comment (to different user) long term issues possible, are, like said user despite likely survive still want contract even mean? suggesting policy based “we don’t know” ignoring science known?  end goal suggesting suggest ignore science/data available formulating move forward virus?

My end goal agree general comment another user tried turn kind weird pissing match me. Literally nothing policy moving forward discussed user even prior know exactly infection rates, deaths effects covid population age grout. data utilizing push fear covid you’re advocating for?

I'm pushing fear kind. I'm pushing anything, actually even reply chain begin replied someone else took upon tell ""It’s like ppl outright ignore data science push unsubstantiated fear mongering"". Perhaps look back chain see advocating thing person was, catching covid despite age group likely survive still want system cause long-term issues. Literally nothing anything else even directed data using? simply looking stoke fear?  explain lack verifiable evidence support whatever you’re advocating for..

Again, looking ""stoke"" fear. said anything searchable relatively easy find. verify quick search MIS-C long-term effects people 20 die covid. Everything said came CDC, Yale Medicine, WHO, Mayo clinic probably couple others forgotten. one trying say people 20 die (false) lasting effects (also false current ""long term"" are). disagree number dead long term illness smaller younger age group, also literally never said this, seem trying use gotcha moment, say happen false.

I honestly understand got point bringing stuff never mentioned general comment made someone else. looking debate someone time energy might want try find somewhere else. Hope wonderful day. I'd really surprised places like HEB, Costco etc suddenly give requiring masks. think change usually skeevy superspreader places like Twin Peaks clubs. think maybe slowly open everything back up; rather reopen everything instantly. seems like bad idea.

But decline hospitalizations increase vaccination, guess Texans gonna Nation's guinea pig see happens go drastic measure regards reopening. appreciate link.

So far, everything stock/fully booked still. That’s already it’s been...how people think political battle?? Nothing going change regardless action governor takes. Happened every state  mask mandates

I'm sure much good first place, many people wear masks private gatherings; behind bulk cases Winter. People believe masks continue wear anyways, goes people really understand votes this. I'll wearing mask public transportation rest life. guys fun getting unnecessarily ill. people care flu enough wear masks. Even East Asian countries stereotypically described mask cultures, minority do, least healthy people displaying symptoms. deaths, averaging 34 mask mandate averaging 228 now? mission accomplished looks like? Depression talking here. Stick topic hand stay out. shopping beer friends, person game nights

Where can't right now? I'm super restrictive west coast officially kosher state guidelines. go indoors bar 25% capacity friend get beer outside, retail open, guideline 5 people private indoor gatherings (but really who's going enforce that?).

Just people reddit make absolutist statements wrong mean listen them. plenty redditors, even health officials, *always* say bad ideas. gotta decide yourself. Realistically young healthy people seeing big deal right now. Probably. Symptoms often aid spread disease. still stay stopped season 9!! went shit bought tickets Florida (already second vaccine) non-stop issues flights canceled changed. hope better luck. UK ""euro country"" EU exporting vaccines importing. 

Generally speaking, vaccine nationalism vaccine export bans bad thing everybody industry relies international supply chain.   homeless still required maintain social distancing defecating streets sidewalks, however. true. I’m curious see numbers look coming weeks... Dakotas highest cases per capita country don't, they'll bs excuse agree majority said, fairness shitload mixed signals coming various offices led lot confusing messaging. state went ""2 weeks flatten curve"" ""Ok summer things back normal"" ""no normal vaccine."" 

Even fairly well educated college graduate times got confused different messaging. can't blame anyone also confused thought would back degree normalcy sooner summer 2021. Oh no! They're afraid enough. RELEASE VARIANT X motto seem shortsighted now, doesn’t change reality current situation evolved time additional research. 

We shouldn’t use frustration accuracy old advice guide current approach. Also people lie say vaccinated don’t wear mask. again. need both. long stores right thing, matter selfish people think. I've going non-stop since June. regrets it. Done. say that, that's theoretically true I've seen first hand someone ""power"" explicitly saying ""wear mask"" lead people choosing wear one. How, may ask? workplace. one wear mask. bosses never explicitly said masks, also never explicitly said wear them. 20 people office saw every day months even saw start double mask single one decided going mask well. absolutely cannot trust people wi ""right"" thing explicitly told it.  thing is, states quite open still followed curves others. It’s like haven’t seen states open things ‘prematurely’, look Florida Georgia iowa. Another thing aren’t going ‘stop’ Covid, we’re going make issue that’s worth fuss. I’d say good portion restrictions never worth it, Covid track become minor issue. Also, 90%+ capacity hospitals isn’t kind thing that’ll break them, it’s commonplace hospitals 90% slightly busy time. It’s like don’t resources get healthcare capacity, much time, haven’t really needed it. think sees attention Noem DeSantis getting CPAC wants action. constituents die, higher go 2024 GOP primary polls. 2 weeks right? yearly covid rewatch new theory: smoke monster source covid, began Locke opened hatch old normal ~30,000 flu deaths year.

Even cut number third, people would see ""If save 10,000 lives"" say ""sign up"". mean, invade whole country death third number. finish line right fucking fuck Florida higher deaths per capita rate Mexico. country they'd 15th world. ""Better"" relative, overall US piss poor. That's scientist said media asked question. Media reported ""vaccine may prevent transmission"", they're idiots. point using point invalidate masks inept Exactly. Redditors put lot faith statistics 

Like doubt someone census going door door Syria shelling skirmishes Caracas entire country disintegrating gathering population data. god speed vaccinating teachers bad?  can't things? second ""lockdown"" even close shopping all, bars/restaurants closed around holidays think supposed restrictions still, many following. state seemed one cautious ones. countries also lifted lot restrictions. ""AZ's reputation already suffered back November efficacy results trials reported. course people thought bad read 50%-70% botched trials vs 95% mRNA every newspaper.""

Interim results published December showed 62-90% efficacy. I’ve worn one least 45 hours week since started(~11 months), point found world going like forever wouldn’t really mind. Wearing mask hard, huh. Either people immune vaccination they'll immune infection. matter. know I'm totally getting banned this, performance mask wearing areas non-mask wearing areas identical. Masks clearly work flu, covid, year in, obvious ineffective. 

We need cancel busybody interventions keep what's actually working: vaccinations. wear mask protect you. wear mask protect me. Neither effective without other. owe other. agree sad *need* mandate mask wearing, are. AZ sent request approval later hide production shortfalls. fact, AZ admitted 60% reduction supplies 1 week EMA approval. “What’d call me?” Lots people dying cause impatient. Humans live Texas, hes spring break. we're choosing economy public health still Americans fucking stupid wearing mask hard us pretending Europe listen scientists though. enforced strict measures, results bad well.

Some nations natural advantages going used advantage.  terrifying writing comment underneath article says vaccine appear almost completely stop transmission. mention anyone disagrees decision isolate however long want. heard manus washington heights variant? Im saying wrong. Believe me, pray right chance mutate enough vaccine wont work lock one case common cold Mars? restrictions first resort, would never them. Uh what? Yes people know COVID flu absolutely encouraged self isolate. deadly viruses, neither common cold.  RemindMe! 2 weeks wonder timing partially nudged fit Texas Independence Day. 

Either way, sounds dumb! false dichotomy. ""open 100%"" still require masks possible! point? wife teaches special ed school NJ schools least hybrid. person since September currently 5th covid contact quartine parents send sick kids school DNGAF. Um, trump's pandemic response plan. Open churches easter 2020. good plan. first recorded case equal first case country. New diseases wind going undetected period identified. Research indicated covid lot earlier February would please try actually cite specific countries accusing certain conditions? makes hard actually look claiming unless provide concrete detail.

It's also fairly unfair keep sourcing data keep giving vague claim unsourced data. That's actual discussion. That's throwing stuff wind. News articles need clicks Georgia well we're fine here. Exactly. end? us Nikes iPhones clothes items come slave labor go back writing letters, stitching clothing, etc etc.

Like point you’re projecting insecurity think moral absolutism everyone else.

Now finishing up, people want wear masks flu season wear masks. stay home get pickup groceries.

I’m going back normal living. gave entire year life protect wife newborn daughter, family, strangers alike. That’s big enough sacrifice. 

Once shot arm, I’m back. restrictions, doom gloom, masks, etc. 

I one life live that’s it. people crazyyyyy think crossing finish line means gotta go back halfway rerun half marathon again. ""Sacrifice one summer epic Christmas.""

Calling now. I'm amazed actually upvotes here. live Alabama surprised see many people willing eat inside restaurant go rural places even staff wearing masks. none less, cases dropping like crazy peak, hospitalization June levels. think dust settles, highly publicized, might realize mask mandates effective anyways. people wear cloth mask discover perhaps slow spread 5%, sold put much importance expect 50%.  
I'm going take guess nothing really happens Texas course next month move onto next thing. like Florida beaches last spring again. not? 75% intend get vaccinated. reason end lockdown now. third wave Biden's fault anyway.  
 
/s That's I've seen SC right next phase gets opened up. makes sense think public health adversarial terms, similarly court law. Public health experts *always* encourage greater precautions, that's job, decide falls neutral notion right wrong. non-tech business community representing traditional in-person economy likewise, *as rule*, advocate side debate. decision makers play role judge, reconciling competing adversarial interests. ""Allowing public health experts lead"" conflating roles judiciary prosecution; public health experts litigators particular side debate, fine, again, that's job, ought treated such. Went Florida early January. Changed perspective sure. Australia New Zealand remarkably successful containing new sources spread mandatory quarantines international arrivals aggressive contact tracing, combined short circuit breaker style lockdowns outbreaks occur. 

They far exceeded expectations, result aggressive measures currently enjoying public gatherings ordinary quality life. cite actual data. data mostly disagrees point. Texas voters concerned Coronavirus. approval rating positive here, full opening right supported data see. 

  

# CORONAVIRUS SERIOUSNESS (FEBRUARY TEXAS STATE GOVERNMENT APPROVAL: HANDLING RESPONSE CORONAVIRUS (FEBRUARY 2021)

 SAFE UNSAFE FOLLOWING? (FEBRUARY AZ deliver lot, time. yes!! can’t wait get vaxxed, many later year start returning normalcy 🙌🏼 unreal much pisses off. that's big fault messaging reporting we've around it. Yep. want family able hold baby. That’ll great day. freeking YEAR’S time! we’re woods getting close. meant everything safe relation “old normal.” want wear mask 2025, go it. people won’t ever again. can’t even parse English. saying? Don’t tell you’re feeling pretend robots communicate simple point. That's correct. EMA started rolling reviews vaccines EU portfolio months phase 3 readout. what's important high risk. elderly immune compromised. It’s pretty obvious live Texas. Fellow Mainer here. bookmarked worldometers, 

China: 89,923 cases, 4,636 deaths

(X) Doubt OK. unvaccinated house member probably too. early evidence points significant reduction spread vaccinated people.  username checks cluster? data not? know early confusion AstraZeneca messed dosage trial, assumed data aspect cleared up. 

Is case? surely Murphy Cuomo top GOP primary polls, no? deaths-per-capita. Hell, poor DeSantis would way back 28th.  Finally, rational person. completely relevant. vaccines take long costs ton money produce vaccine. COVID vaccine entire weight government financing behind it. miracle, something skeptical of.  Yes. feel bad older population dying risk. But, millions millions kids losing valuable years life. sacrificed much older population transitions WFH lives hardly change. feel terrible high school seniors college freshman. single transformative two years life expected give without second thought, last group able return normal. think it’s incredibly unfair.  one speak certainty yet vaccines virus mutations interact. Anyone says know certain lying. hit 10% nationally vaccinated

Now time declare victory remove mask rule, giving virus chances sicken mutate people hoping praying milder strains

If can't spread, can't mutate got Astra. better non! went like 130 kg 90 less year staying home. countries contained first wave, let run wild second wave.

The US first confirmed case month Italy did. Same. want family able hold baby. That’ll great day. wonder poles react it. Obviously western vaccine ""make gay"" probably turns german muslim that's big no. might think chinese vaccine might turn communist? shit Texas pulled today, sooner rather later would great. please add words: narrative, agenda, surge, brink  Florida one worst states variants.

[US COVID-19 Cases Caused countries managed get state built entire response science focused platform. want compare results separate approaches handling pandemic, can't fault comparing results separate approaches handling pandemic. 

You literally asked comparison. ... please stop this? mRNA new technology, researched decades. regular vaccines take long full government support basically unlimited funding behind development like COVID did. could mild case COVID yet lasting damage lungs cardiovascular system. sound fun? No? get vaccine. there’s another dangerous respiratory disease going around causes pandemic 

its called everything safe

everything safe. see flu hope right family there, sounds pretty stupid waiting another month month half would least take care senior citizens. Since Abbott moron, much hope.

edit: 7% vaccinated? actual fuck Existing manufacturing facilities retrofitted J&amp;J vaccine much easier two  lot Brazilians infected early, makes sense virus coming again. know isn’t like chicken pox, one done. 

I think world eventually pull together provide Brazil vaccinations. take them? I’m sure least will. must difficult watch death destruction know happen stop it.  people really wanna learn hard way. year this, I'm ok let them. mean, point even there's something enjoy twice year, overdue. makes complete sense- hope enjoy soon! People already unhappy, people already following precautions. hadn’t seen before. wonder shouldn’t pair them? can’t find explanation. Agreed. People rushing reopening gonna prolong everything entered one dangerous times coronavirus freedom choice ends kill others I've seen movie before.  ain't it. lifting rules agree going extend pandemic years. Worst could happen Texas gets another spike cases going summer.
Mutations fake news they're getting way hyped honestly. never hear phrase “social distancing” life still soon. also think worth risk drive car travel even though might hit someone someone might hit me. could freeze Texans last month. wants unleash covid deaths. dummy tracking chart available right tracking various vaccines efficacy in: reducing mild symptoms, reducing major symptoms, reducing transmission?

Would curious see stacks up, especially traditional vs mRNA doses Let’s real. folk wearing mask distancing continue to. folk never gave fuck wont. It’s matter individually assess risk. Wait till hears Florida started shipping J&amp;J Monday likely administering late week early next week. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* agree, things normal 4th July (barring something truly unlucky terrible), people happy. plug ears shove head sand, typical expected Yes They're afraid we've still done none actual work defeat pandemic. lost year deadbeat administration reveled idea 'certain states' suffering. Individual states allowed run completely wild, plans keep spreading across state lines. *never actual lockdown, literal bare minimum necessary counter pandemic*. current federal administration less shrugged shoulders meaningful help action necessary god forbid *too much*. countries Africa *just* got Ebola Pandemic, illusion wealth, there's nothing suggests US capable handling Covid better. lose decade lives *feel* like things normal now. I'm sad thought lives saving lives harmless actions makes mad instead giddy. covid aladeen instead I'm using general ""you."" Try  I’m get downvoted saying this, it’s definitely soon open place like Texas. 49th place vaccinations, hospitals many counties 90% capacity, small minority vaccinated. get want go back normal really helping anyone, specially considering close stopping know taboo really taking account economic impact. 

The motto back Spring ""It's actually better economy strict restrictions!!""


That totally debunked.

The places went ""hard"" masks, curfews, capacity restrictions, etc absolutely leveled.

The places reaping benefits.

It's year. time admit failure. 

CA, NY, MA, etc failed stop virus also caused massive economic harm.

SD, FL, TX, etc booming people/business going keep moving people want wear masks live fear 24/7. cases. ensure catch illness, symptoms significantly reduced.

All they'd tested vaccines far that. Basically people would longer get seriously ill (or even moderately). could still catch and/or spread it.

So somewhat expected, proven thus something could rely on. Even people keto eat carbs. nearly impossible eat protein fat literal LEAST people do. infringement anyone's rights wear piece cloth order protect tasked protecting, irrespective political affiliation. number seems low, consider Tuesday usually ""slump"" day. double number reported doses last Tuesday. nearly double number reported doses two weeks ago. mom loves going concerts shows, bought tickets musical October birthday. felt surreal think might actually happen! said thing 2 week lock lol Right, mean county local government subdivision, country  vaccine protects getting ill, necessarily stop picking disease passing on. It’s anti-science bullshit. 

It takes minimum two weeks *after* first dose level protection, actual trial data 2 weeks SECOND dose.

This completely jumping gun based actual levels protection community, even among first groups getting vaccinated. 

But apparently, lives worth needlessly losing people don’t deal horror wear mask another month.  zero cost wearing mask

Your refusal wear one makes clear see protecting lives priority, thus proper thing ignore hope rest country less selfish hell would mask mandates next winter expect enough doses highly effective vaccines drastically reduce transmission everyone US beginning summer?? seriously think kind messaging sensible likely get people board? kidding little soon, wait like another couple months nope instead jump gun shit like think people deal August, HUGE surprise.

This said months. think people deal August. people abide precautions right now, months go by. 

But think public policy walking back precautions restrictions step-wise, once.  problem surface disinfectants work seconds. sitting wet required length time, killing weaker bugs letting stronger ones copulate other, expediting variants, including disinfectant resistant variants. think impacts much. Federal mask mandate affects certain places afaik, like public transportation would keep mask rules anyways elderly can’t get yes are. areas 60-70% elderly still without. Yet plenty young “essential workers” can. Supersedes believe. two weeks everybody knew long haul. public messaging June basically said would go indefinitely. better every way. 

Do people advocating full reopening today genuinely think restrictions going extended 2 3 months time 2045? don’t immediately reopen we’ll lose opportunity? dumb thing say CDC says otherwise. don’t know people getting idea goal open things over

I think might case familiarity. US States known shut weather-related event occurs like hurricane snowstorm, Covid ballpark mentality ""When gone done, life resume."" cases disease, reliable statements effectiveness vaccine people 65 possible point time,” said.

The initial decision ignore EMA unconditional approval appalling lack pragmatism come statements like even wealth real life data pretty inexcusable. Reference then. Cite. This. Restrictions always last resort.  cost? remember reading weeks ago Russia's Sputnik vaccine, similar J&amp;J vaccine, showed pretty large jump efficacy second round. hopeful J&amp;J one would well. Daylight Savings/Later Sunset: 12 days (1w, 5d) 

Spring: 18d (2w, 4d)  “dangerous” thing buying groceries is...oh wait nothing. Never was, never be. obsession literally everything “safe” nauseating. highly dramatized movies this, Saving Private Ryan-like stuff years lmao next days. winter weather slowed things pretty consistantly around 85% doses distributed administered.  know meant reply me, reply seems context. 


I saying US selfish, saying even selfish perspective supports us assisting global immunization effort. never pass anal. Tell embarrass can't sure anymore lying claim believe. Say lost trust taper contact, point full-blown shunning necessary.

Or keep whatever, guess. nothing going change mind except actual consequences. Nothing. thanks bud don’t focus trolls devoid back n forth conversation thought exercises. God bless makes happy see governors loosening restrictions. basically prison NC. Can’t wait go Florida April. Whenever medicine given someone, weight part dosage. Tall people use medicine short people. mean clearly helped. people wear masks hospital settings help prevent spread disease. given wearing masks completely harmless action point refusing continue celebrate selfish simply sake selfish pretty fucked thing do.  exactly. comparing flu isnt always saying current level risk like flu, saying goal getting risk level flu like levels. even lower would great waiting around return normal even less risk flu. 

get flu like levels risk, reopen *everything*, stop masking social distancing orders, keep working lowering risk via vaccines treatments much possible. Exactly! Texas resident myself, I’m full agreement you, but, know ton idiots state. Got first Pfizer shot Saturday ended sore arm 20 years long time.  ""The Greatest Generation"" really bad, 1918 flu pandemic, WW1, Great Depression, WW2.  least America, WW2 things became really good them. 

But, guess history life nothing suffering death every day. People 10 kids 1/3 would die infants. People died regularly things consider minor inconvenience now. New Jersey, common live 65+ person, essential worker, high risk individual they'll vaccinate everyone Atlantic City supersite. anecdotal know young people vaccinated New Jersey unvaccinated. They're moving Jersey  need get internet turn TV day 10 USA UK gave emergency approval, EU insisted full approval. Full approval needs data. Everything balance risk vs convenience. speed limit higher demand convenience. OSHA exists interrupt convenience little bit manage risk. 

The risk flu society worth inconvenience getting flu shot washing hands, it’s worth masks waiting line go Whole Foods standard winter. I'm curious see shakes out. folks one side want whatever works best (myself included) would rather get mRNA based vaccines, preferring traditional vaccine, even less effective. demand roughly proportionate, one demand?

This even assumes really much choice time comes. actions permanently mandated using crisis shock-doctrine people allowing risk-averse forcibly impose subjective definition ""small"" ""harmless"" onto rest population, yes. Man actually like social distancing capacity limits degree hate fucking masks lol. L'Hospital's, L'Hôpital's. FOMO, negativity, fears manage, mine.

lol I'm negative, I'm happy people this. Amazing! anyone list completely open states? know grown recently Iowa, Montana many joining open gang. Happy US! Proud live here. 


Meanwhile county CA still hasn’t indoor dining, gyms, movie theaters, 3 elementary schools (500k pop) open. end sight. Moron: *sees cases Texas drop*

Moron: ""I succeeded!""

Moron: *forgets massive winter storm kept everyone indoors two weeks ago* mostly agree, cases actually starting plateau concerning amidst variants. long freakishly mutated variant emerge (hard say chances that) think plateau (or wave) short-lived vaccinations immunity Wait. reports say exact opposite yesterday? lol I’m going start triple quadruple masking 1. Obese people 2x risk compared 100-600x risk older.

2. Need source spreading, presumably people getting infected would make sense

3. Weight calculation kinds dosing since dosing kind medicine began. need calculate different dose child compared 6' adult man.  live texas, still going weak mask even vaccinated. want protect people surround me, selfish wonder impact business person attempting obtain assistance insurance unemployment.

What nightmare. also define over.

Over apparently means ""immortality obtained"".

If think one minute people going pull crap every flu cold season crazy.

Get ready hear dangers RSV see scary charts ""HOSPITALS 99%"" every flu season. relief hour virtually nothing pain

. Abbott doesn’t care people. don’t know people keep defending him. Stop questioning science! knew sides hardware! 🤣 think point ""Done"" implies started first place. shit forget 2020 time, always refer last year 2019 gloss 2020 far, Flu pandemics 50s 60s killed COVID

This true. Estimates little 1 million killed, adjusted population growth little 2 million. Covid 2.5 million deaths worldwide. apples apples comparison - numbers flu post hoc estimates numbers covid counted cases. Post hoc estimates covid certainly going significantly higher counted statistics. politics, science. science proves young healthy people need vaccine.

Get vaccines people need want them. 1/3 Americans right decide need vaccine. subreddit days ago, remember link. Thanks, sent father, hopefully get soon. Chile, Morocco?  That's about, ""muh freedoms!!!"" abstraction. paying people getting people back work government handouts national crisis evil something. /s ones worked countries cant close border stay isolated dont know dry tinder? think republicans dumb? operation warp speed (republican initiative) vaccine wouldn’t released public quickly. someone moderate, maybe look sides intolerant shitty person.  It’s definitely little early. ~7% state vaccinated. Still claims? Oh, people absolutely deal August, matter, COVID done us.  thought would come day Russia China would better ally Mexico neighbor. 

The fact think DiaperDon got elected surprises me. Gregg Abbott? Science trial error means don’t always get right first time. highly doubt UK study flawed, I’d rather 100% ensure vaccine efficient US public rather forcing early causing people doubt vaccine many already do. worn mask 100% time required pandemic. 

We pandemic. haven’t work masks this? like not, masks big disruption lives. make communication difficult, bad children’s development, nuisance. It’s fine global airborne pandemic, standard flu season.  I'm saying Fauci claims. proudly says coordinated misinformation campaign masks to. Might come shock working class people option to. People comparing ""two week quarantine"" promised last March, time around actual reason say 2-3 months: vaccine. current rate we're vaccinating people, everyone wants one access summer. speculative guess anymore could over, majority Americans vaccinated 2-3 months. Tallmadge (N/E Summit County), near Kent. never open appointments Akron area. Never one second. figured wee need drive least hour away, found some. 


Incidentally, wife preschool teacher managed book appointment Friday. mother gets jab Saturday. job could quite literally replaced vending machine, pre-packaged medications available Dr's offices, think pay quite reasonable. 

With advent services like Amazon Pharmacy, think things like vaccination drives keeping profession pharmacist life support.  Nobody wants take personal responsibility. Every excuse anyone invent Americans fat, like stress, lack time overworked, lack education, poverty, health problems, shitty healthcare system, etc. exist poor 3rd world countries yet people fat Americans. ""I consider thing people care crisis need everyone something want order address it"" dangerous road go down, dangerous ""there thing minding business business everyone else's business"" ""the functions currently performed police instead performed whole community."" Story really ""There enough studies yet concretely prove pretty much know applicable vaccines, vaccination prevents transmission said disease""  couldn’t done another year. barely made 12 months. can’t imagine depression I’d locked 12 months, wife 5 month old isolated family, friends, living.

I would’ve us taking calculated, much frequent risks already were. 

I never going give 2 years entire life shit, I’m thankful every single second day vaccines here. impatiently waiting turn. RemindMe! 2 months  Economy != money

Bad economies create bad living standards creates list issues correlated death. new normal crew shall known ""too soon crew"". Look, taking term food desert literal manner. “propaganda term,” whatever means, academic phrase used within multiple disciplines geography, urban planning, sociology. 

Honestly, I’m going keep arguing specific term, whether believe thing “food desert” not, think agree *there areas healthy food convenient less healthy options,* important aspect consider looking America’s Obesity epidemic. wide variety reasons America (and nations) struggles obesity, including personal responsibility, nutrition oversight, education, yes, easy concise isn’t access unhealthy food rather healthy options. want combat obesity, address factors, don’t believe one singular concept food deserts understand this, recognize obesity isn’t disease caused solely laziness lack personal responsibility. people get them, yes. nothing human facial cues. Nothing insanity treating healthy plague rats. 

I hope like hermitage going back normal (the OLD normal) faster probably ready for. 

I one hope state goes back prohibition public masking (it felony charge back 2020) strong suspicion anonymity afforded masks increases criminality, looting, knockout game type attacks, etc. Greece pretty good. Go there. What's date today? It’s called Guillain Barre Syndrome, real problem covid. Also, googling that, google “covid long haul” Yea bad people actually stay home Americans fucking idiots. work HEB. confirm I’ve seeing maskless customers store months now. don’t anyone door offering masks anymore turning away. way to

Debatable. time play guitar, also started learning German.  Wearing masks applying recommendations scientists South Korea got control. need one message politicians. Abbott needs held accountable inevitably happen.

[South Korea South Dakota has* population 800k. There’s like nobody highest cases per capita.   mean, hard disagree unless cases trend again, would weird. Massachusetts literally opening almost everything they're far conservative state gets.

The difference is, sarcastically say ""two weeks"", time there's reason expect things get better soon. places lift restrictions community spread way immunity way up, public opinion rapidly turn leadership. yet. hold true get greater buy in. Yea that's I'm doing. I'm going weekend go gym everyday two weeks people still wear masks without mandates Best thing March end quasi ""lockdown"" rules restrictive states - i.e. California every state hold line wait. Nah, made solidified urine. grifter money even yellow painted metal  Heroic?

I'm person trying save lives. That's heroic. That's good person moral compass. takes heroic today states?

How far we've fallen. Wow, thanks letting know pain isn’t actually gone. migraines osteopath bring 8 2 meds can’t actually still hurting 8. endometriosis cramping making cry pain actually still bad saw RMT. suppose limping knee aches still I’m imagining I’m walking better.  Wearing masks absolutely mandatory this. understand wearing one you’re sick need go store main way prevent spread flu future tell people STAY HOME sick. Instead promoting masks, need promote telling people stay home sick. many people attitude, “well I’ll suck go work” get everyone else sick. attitude needs change. Mandatory indefinite mask wearing flu season get fucked. Source? don’t mean party pooper... aren’t multiple strains virus (California UK strain) vaccine can’t protect against? No, still mask mandates here, set counties businesses, they're going anywhere time soon. That’s great thing freedom choice. choose take many precautions want others choose Mmm delicious! despite masks, infection rates go other, masking parts country?

I know regions like Texas super scrutiny like Sweden, exaggerating cases daily doom gloom articles reckless pay price. Make sure report side effect via cdc signup Youuuu still need wear mask get vaccinated…  able stop wearing gloves over?  Nah fuck that. food never fresh delivered. Actually closing gyms swimming pools made worse many like going walk densely populated places  That's fair. think OP's line thinking always places blame others pandemic existing (""_I_ can't go back normal other's responsible enough""), that's appropriate way view this. _Even if_ 100% responsible, we'd still borders locked hard we'd terrified letting virus in, we'd basically reach 100% vaccination rate we'd comfortable going back normal. words, even ""doing right thing"" made go faster, may actually prolonged things. Delusional, go texas; people businesses ignored mandates past july outside big 4 cities. shouldn’t feel bad. manual labor mask it’s really bad. all. said government mandates, masks. going get adults want end April start getting kids. nuts! RemindMe! 2 months  game sounds terrible. play nurse giving vaccines 8 hours day get clock out?   worked places (NY, NJ, CA) would far less deaths per million places (SD, FL, GA, etc).

They don't.

Again California low obesity rates, warm weather, young population, insanely high mask usage, extremely high restrictions deaths per million FL, TX, GA, etc


It failed. Atlantic article published weeks ago stated. One we're entering ""in between"" time ""Pandemic"" ""post Pandemic"". Something takes time variants cause virus make significant ""comeback"", light vaccines virus time side. France antivax kingdom, nowhere else Europe situation bad. Macron calling AZ quasi-ineffective older people certainly help.  mean, sociable person pandemic, *not* taking another year shit. get fully vaccinated, good amount people too, moving damn life. seems subreddit addicted doom gloom *fuckin' ready* semblance normalcy. golden idol tells so. lockdowns work. Crap lockdowns work. Crap anything work. Crap knives cut, crap cars handle well, crap stereos sound bad. uk lockdowns bought bloke pub swore nicked would work perfectly. restrictions imposed uk half measures, imposed late, lifted early, badly observed enforced there. result economy operating whole year twilight uncertainty little prospect end. vaccines hail mary hope work. Texas lifted today. followed similar waves areas similar demographics, culture, geography did. small summer wave, like CA, NV, AZ,TX, southern states winter wave like entire US did. Plus FL much higher average age US states. learn live it. 

That's made vaccines. everyone wants vaccine get vaccine Texas right now? NO.

It's flattening curve anymore, making sure enough people vaccinated. States even consider opening every adult able get vaccine. Correct. learned understand longer true. 

We also used think Earth center universe, solar system, flat. used know multiple blood types, used aware bacteria viruses. 

We learn new things adapt standpoint necessary. 

This difficult concept understand. huh? people still wearing masks majority places helps keep cases down.  course study long-term effects. ""cutting corners"" assumed meant process holes normal non-Pandemic approval process. example shows normal non-Pandemic approval process already perfect opinion even makes harder argue, side effects occur, caused cutting corners already flawed standard process. sub, lot people like that.

Can confirm. Plenty people crap going gym. aware Texas ever closed Oh yeah, marched people deaths order make buck. Completely fucked again. one knows sick. simply asking sick people wear enough   Wearing masks resulted virtually flu deaths year. could save approximately 50,000 lives year 500,000 people need die order care? lifetime people died flu COVID. worrisome you? 23.2 doses per American average 22.76 gaining National average every day. Pretty good. Countries universally listening recommendations scientists things like in-person sporting events sorts nice things can't United States huge chunk population want listen people whose entire lives dedicated handling situations like this.

when adjust outcomes population, country like Canada significantly better United States. New Zealand, South Korea, etc much better outcomes leaned heavily following recommendations medical community. US adult obesity rate 42.4 percent. hoss. don’t mind seeing world burn. suppose believe science chiropractors well they’re established everywhere right? 

Hint: reason still experience pain. experts go idea they’re talking about. You’re lied scammed money. 100% getting locked lol stupid decision Texas. Ah yes, spring winter 2020 would’ve fine didn’t wear masks!, deaths, hospitalizations new cases would’ve happened. Thanks solving problem! counties Napa, Santa Clara, San Luis Obispo moved red tier well.

From article, red tier includes:

-Expanding outdoor dining allow three households six people

-Allowing personal services require removal masks outdoors indoors, specific health safety measures place

-Opening indoor dining (including bars full meal service, food courts, hotel restaurants) 25% capacity, limited four people one household, requiring indoor dinner service end 10 p.m., safety requirements

-Opening indoor gyms fitness centers 10% capacity

-Opening indoor museums, zoos aquariums 25% capacity

-Opening indoor movie theaters 25% capacity without concessions

-Opening outdoor stand-alone amusement park rides Ferris wheels, carousels train rides

-Lifting nighttime restrictions gatherings non-essential business activities hours 10 p.m. 5 a.m.

-Allowing limited use indoor pools

While state allows indoor retail expand 50% capacity red tier, S.F. keep capped 25%. Small indoor gatherings also remain restricted.  Neither. simply makes sense limited amount time. someone wants lie status risk life

They risking lives anyone yet vaccinated. Yep they’ll start using evidence “vaccines don’t work” didn’t wait work. It’s right time relax restrictions good bit given cases gone despite media hype variants, variants haven’t caused cases go up. Moving relaxed reopening tier bad idea even sub won’t agree likelihood.

However Texas pretty irresponsible far soon. Go BIG go home!!! Amirite Texas?! must know lot conservatives. No. 200 pounds lot 40+ year old male.

Its crazy people believe this... countries can't close borders?
The fact stipulated border bollocks sets every alarm. reason UK closed borders. say UK extra special like countries. bollocks. Nothing. 

Cases, hospitalizations, deaths keep falling Texas. dumb...the government aren’t ones reopening anything weren’t restricting much begin with. lack activity governed Individuals, businesses, physical reality virus. isn’t political battle lost, it’s dumbest thing I’ve seen lifetime people think is.  We're planning 2-day, 20+ acts music festival end August I'm damn hopeful! LOL DeSantis won’t stick plan, know going open 100% too. every governor who’s politically tied ex-President. It’s gonna open season conservative states now. Anyone returning Canada starters.  well giving made clear want share saving lives, actively want prevent people saving lives clear values far gone try conversation with

have fun plan get people killed. certainly hope enough decent Americans remain try stop Texas spike cases this, Fauci public health people never let us hear end not, never going sacrifice much 12 months. 

Now imagine government held end bargain paid people stay (mostly) home period time, would closer lot sooner. *orange idol there’s new variants scientists warning us about. It’s never ending cycle 'Flatten curve' meant get close zero possible, become numb massive number cases.

'Flatten curve' mean stop preventative measures hit steady baseline 10k 20k 50k cases day. Hi there, Texas here! idiot governor lifted mask mandate definitely going fuck rest nation. boy Ted “Cancun” Cruz sure bring COVID wherever may be. mean went Florida. he’s super spreader, don’t know is. waited 85 days, could get behind forcing families shelter closely others still heat 

So lockdowns dumb encourage people exactly said causing transmission?

Lol. quests demand restrictions literally strongly argued restrictions.

The stupidity public health experts amazing. think average BMI doesn’t paint true picture obesity problem US. Mean vs median variation around values. Also, age group geographical, socioeconomic group. going states countries listened scientists? Governor Texas. vaccines prevent illness transmission said cold flu virus built against. 

Flu vaccine designed target 3-4 flu strains predicted dominant year.

Because cold flu mutate rapidly (also typically deadly) there's high chance still catch/transmit strain cold/flu vaccine offered zero protection for. Predictions strains dominant given year also easily incorrect. 

So yes offer immunity protection transmission, there's much higher odds protecting wrong virus well.  Exactly. fear-mongering obsession continuing Hell we’ve fucking strange. second I’m good go vaccine, never utter word coronavirus again, never wear mask unless absolutely to, etc. 

Accept reality, going back normal living. thank stars above. not.

Iowa removed mandate February 10th. 7 day rolling average cases **still** went down.

Where spike? Iowa apocalyptic hellhole Covid? live Tampa Bay, we’ve wearing masks per local mask mandate since nearly beginning. Despite mandate unenforceable law, still wear inside businesses exception bars, gyms, restaurants. 

We aren’t Brazil big counties, populated places, culture mask wearing. equivalent celebrating win 1 point lead team 3 free throws time left clock  worry.  Texas guinea pig see happens pandemics, large cities, social darwinism. 

I predict mass death materialism. What's prediction? read write post understand autocorrect well pain. degree psych, including things like placebo affect, know well. suffer multiple conditions causing pain, understand feel don’t. attended multidisciplinary pain therapy clinics extended periods time given multiple coping techniques including things simple breathing changing thought processes, placebo well? know gynecologists, psychologists, physiotherapists physicians specializing pain therapy? recommend RMT Osteopath I’m pretty sure trust pain relief past 3 years opinion Reddit rando telling well educated experts wrong. comment far much hyperbole taken seriously. need foster work culture encouraged acceptable stay home sick. absolutely realistic given dealt past year. think majority people succumb wearing mask future Covid gone, kidding yourself. think we'll fine Texas. Deaths/Hospitalizations continue decline us get vaccine. multiple vaccines year ago? spread = opportunities variant sufficient immune escape characteristics current vaccines develop. 

From risk/benefit perspective gain essentially nothing risking 6+ month reset vaccine rollout. political posturing nothing more. Back 1918 mask mandates enforced gunpoint. understand restrictions seem orwellian, really mild compared past viral outbreaks. difference effort collective global scale. Today's Americans would dealt well restrictions 1918. worries Covid go wild Texas, new variant emerge, rest country end dealing thus prolonging whole situation.  finish line sooooooo close, rush it?  Amazing organization 6 percent clergy know giving recommendations vaccines politics. want break traveling. Oh doing. Projection real flu? mask mandates basically erased year's flu outbreak.

Makes think much Covid would spread without them... literally destroying businesses last minute.

I didn’t minimize trips wear mask part fucking year catch store lifted mask mandate months I’m eligible vaccine. won’t business lifts mandate vaccines available I’m alone. businesses caught losing majority business removing mandate dealing violent anti-maskers making scenes Governor said over.  Get ready ""Well SE Asia done years!"" comments.

What people fail tell consensus mask usage areas useless April suddenly amazing.

Or they'll fail tell places WORST flu deahts per capita Earth are.....Japan Korea


So masks super amazing work well work all. Bet could try completely fucking once. stay fuck home shouldn’t even going outside we’re middle pandemic!!!!! Everything bigger Texas, including mutants  I’m conservative I’m happy this. Let’s get america open!!! Masks required Tokyo grocery store normal times. understand, people wear feeling sick. 

Look videos Tokyo metro system shove people onto cars. Maybe 5% people wearing masks. Oh good, numbers averaging 7,700, mask mandate ordered averaging 6,500?

Makes sense, Greg. Keep astounding work. Douchebag. I’ve seen videos packed beaches social distancing masks. places may enforcing it, everywhere. Even Tampa super bowl, everyone thought cases would spike haven’t. know, point risk COVID becomes acceptable opposed throwing everything makes life worth living trash. would probably come summer people, even vaccine. injury made pretty sedentary year. 30 lbs overweight feels horrible. 

I still get called skinny office. There's enough vaccine capacity stop variants forming spread innoculations around world, best focus 1 country time. good lot incorrect? almost much  units that?

Calories moving First Doses First, UK government considered argument vaccines approved use UK,the virus neutralization titres efficacy higher two doses one. therefore higher risk virus replication partial immunity one dose  two doses,   short-term, delaying second dose would expected somewhat increase probability emergence vaccine resistance -but probably low neutralization titres seen  one dose  vaccine  lower  median titre convalescent plasma, within lower range responses seen following natural realistic possibility time immune escape variants emerge, likely driven increasing population immunity following natural infection.

Unlike antibiotic resistance, many ways might end antibody (vaccine) resistance. Yes, might come people getting infected first second doses Pfizer/Moderna. people given one dose J&amp;J weaker vaccines. following natural infection--this may UK SA variants arose.

From variant evolution standpoint, important fewer people imperfect immunity suppress spread rapidly people imperfect immunity come contact virus less often? seem obvious, latter First Doses First way go. It’s funny aircrew exemptions quarantines, (Hawaii, Canada, US international testing requirement return) isn’t priority list ahead general public states. someone smarter explain means? Gottlieb retweeted seems important I'm totally lost... ELI5 vaccines? several vaccines mix using different platforms different efficacies measured using different criteria different circumstances. perhaps ought stop lumping umbrella term “covid vaccine”. Check Lowe’s, stores near enforce masks everybody wears keeps distance. It’s like Walmart vs target, Lowe’s big step Go somewhere else. I'm 29 comorbidities. I'm expecting universal mask mandates go away long get vaccinated. let johnson johnson make vaccine let put bodies.... scary times Germany France shunning vaccine.

Basically Germans French started shitting couple weeks ago. Germans first injecting healthcare workers got bad side effects, Macron jumped comments almost useless.

Fast forward today, 25% AZ vaccine used France, rest sitting fridges, vs much higher uptake Pfizer.

People refusing AZ vaccine offered doctors.

On flip side, got Danes Austrians going Israel cut deal new vaccine doses, Czechs Slovakians ordering Sputnik vaccine, Hungarians ordering Sputnik Chinese one. safe say EU failed joint vaccine order strategy.

Germany France failed rest EU, take position ""we're big boiz look us got EU strong"" shit AZ vaccine together... It’s almost “back normal” means legally.

There’s like zero rules masks still leave house groceries work *almost completely 

There’s still plenty room contagious mutations create vaccine escape. That’s conspiracy. one Macron quote, OP implying. messaging 1 year [**2022-03-02 16:39:37 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2022-03-02%2016:39:37%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

Most likely, people suffering way world currently is. lot people getting short stick life today. work long hours get little back it. They're bombarded advertisements propaganda every angle, making think need want things good them.

They trying regain control lives. conspiracy theories give ""bad guy"" focus concrete way fight (by taking vaccine). makes feel powerful. gives illusion they're pulling back control lives small fashion.

I understand got place... know it. really don't. believe factors trying hard keep people focused conspiracy theories feel like taking action, feel need take action really might help. need things like universal healthcare, higher wages, better schools, possibly even form basic income. 

But things hurt corporations currently charge, spend lot money resources keep people distracted polarized. stop going Home Depot reason. Go Lowe’s, much safer cleaner. IMO it’s political thing. vaccinated lot people. Tens millions. Good points, kind amused getting down-voted. get good estimate infection level sewage system feces relatively high concentration Covid public bathrooms probably good places catch it...

What's units that?

Because depending unit choice there's probably strong link eating much eating. I'm done wasting time you. Hope able deal variants suppressed. wish people would stop using argument. completely apples oranges comparison. Bacteria viruses completely different beasts giving small amount antibiotic *radically* different vaccine exponentially increases immune system's response therefore exponentially decreases viruses ability replicate (and therefore occasionally mutate). “keep hospitals capacity, barely managed”
Yeah U.S never experienced actual lockdown that’s whole issue LMFAOO Texas! Texas! Texas! Kill! Kill! Kill! don’t even understand you’re writing

More people get virus. means deaths, hospitalizations. overall decline take longer. bad scenario, stuff go bit coming back due vaccine takes hold. worst case scenario, new vaccine resistant strain takes hold texas get royally fucked rest us get fucked. best case scenario, slow decline much gets Texas head start recovery. seems like unnecessary risk point data strongly suggest given we're months away actually start reopen stuff safely. masks could easily mandate flu season save even lives. happens soon someone infected non symptomatic supper spreader place lockdowns? spreads again.

And record think restrictions last resort US. state level restrictions implemented doctors threaten quit en mass. mentions ""new studies"" cite them? even stop people passing the virus “almost completely”, head immunisation at Public Health England has revealed.
Dr Mary Ramsay said grounds hope that vaccination may achieve holy grail halting community transmission **emerging new studies**.
“What don’t yet know long might last whether enough stop infection spreading widely population time,” told Radio 4’s Today Tuesday
“But there’s really good signs going least reduce infection rates across population, hopefully ... prevent people passing almost completely they’ve vaccinated fully.” Yeah. figured much fighting tiny piece cloth one places mouth keep killing neighbors.

There absolutely actual imposition here, vice signaling symbolism. Keep good work! still wear two masks N95/equivalent, go shopping much earlier nobody around mean? I'm talking official guidelines understand talking person sporting events though. realize countries able hold person sporting events outlier exception, disingenuous think Texas could achieved results simply 'listening scientists'. China also didn’t lock whole country - localities outbreaks. don’t disagree like said , people never fully comply America - time move stop pretending government restrictions going help us. I’m wearing mask corona longer threat. there’s another dangerous respiratory disease going around causes pandemic , absolutely. everything safe, fuck new normal. like reverse. equal though. Well comment got deleted political lol.

Cheers mate we'll see many keep restrictions, think quite interesting consider Mass conservative state. Except KNOW COVID long lasting bad effects even mild cases, yet vaccines shown next none. I'll take chances vaccine. Oh man got first one morning, second dose scheduled 29th. side effects first shot? expect take days work? read early pandemic. took advantage traveling work focus losing weight. lost 57lbs going ""Obese"" BMI ""Healthy"" BMI. hard work, worth it...especially IRT covid.  try explain months vaccines widely available meme back “oh wait two weeks” “masks forever.”

It completely incapable processing new information situation changes stuck mindset said year ago gospel. It’s right time relax restrictions bit given cases gone despite media hype variants, variants haven’t caused cases go up. Moving relaxed reopening tier bad idea even subreddits won’t agree likelihood.

However Texas pretty irresponsible far soon. one, states reopened bit far still maintain mask mandates Texas getting rid off. good, understandable frustrated. super helpful comments like get reported we're guaranteed see :) unforgivable miss vaccine rollout been.

Could lot worse... Look Europe, Canada, well many places. Side effects universal, parents fine. 70% probably never happen... Based saying, sounds like many people following mandates. like state (we mask mandate), 60% people wear one rest don't. I'm guessing there's pretty high correlation people refuse wear mask mandate vs wear one without mandate. fantastic news. Hopefully first world recover parts world soon follow. Go science! argument fact idiots beat us herd immunity

idiots also got lot people killed everybody acted responsibly.

I hope eating shitty mcdonalds burger inside restaurant instead home, going walmart without *oppressive piece fabric* worth death. Would happen know happens? I've seen it, ever figured out/seen good reason it.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: (for people) shows ""slump"" pretty clearly. many people willing kill go clubbing without mask? Korea far worst flu deaths first world nation. 

Only European nations come even league.


I lol every time hear ""Well Japan wear masks!!!""

Ok........are saying draw attention fact work?? I'm big mask person honestly, probably nothing.

So much spread small personal gatherings people masks anyways.

In NY everyone wearing mask highest cases per 100k right now. thought mask wearing voluntary South Korea. Social pressure conform government mandates UK follow medical recommendations early cost significantly. Italy hit first without benefit knowledge countries later containment. 

Spain I'm less familiar with. 

what practicing right cherry picking, little reckless considering really taking account countries reacted it. quantifying everything either United States United States ignoring countries outside United States also handle poorly.  thanks what? isn’t political decision. isn’t something negotiated. comes majority people businesses behaving well physical reality virus. There’s thing grab onto. watching. isn’t even conflict. There’s way negotiate vote way kind life want vote way rain storm Masks required outdoors (and be). still possible difficult-but-not-impossible catch covid surface contamination, low bar reality, reliably eliminating like 10% potential low-hangin-fruit transmission cases sanitation practices. seemingly majority Texan voters want.

Have got polling data support that? many deaths morally willing accept order us move lives? people fucking following rules. Melbourne one state. wasn’t entire country. unusual circumstance. I'm happy people, also see negative attention others give them. Pog Maine done pretty good job keeping cases low. That's anime con Dallas June attend cancelled, still holding hope con weekend Maine Mall might still go on, pending vaccinations course. Spread cheeks. Cuz getting fucked BIG PHARMA BIG Brother Thank Yup. Keep chugging it! think people deal August, HUGE surprise. I'm man. Wearing mask fucking worst especially wear one hours hours work. Especially everyone work vaccinated anyway feels like waste. No. Ah yes - took train Brno once.

I call pseudoscience either - think test anything that's predicted useful. also hope people start trying treat things still testing, without good info efficacy, dosage, risks, interactions, side-effects, etc. uncomfortable, able see people's faces can't get used to. already like phone calls texting can't see people's face, real life friend could independent contractor food delivery (grubhub, ubereats, doordash) lot money. decline order. block specific restaurants. set schedule. wait car. boss.

Downsides need reliable vehicle, pay gas, vehicle repairs, taxes, health coverage.

I grubhub (I average $12-20 hour, part time) I'd happy walk answer questions. It’s looking like March good month. transition April things looking 5x better right now! We’ve hade HUGE progress year alone.  think could phrase better saying vaccinations acceptable level around May lifting restrictions big deal unless die hard lockdown person good advice. masking asymptomatic (read: sick) people kill flu. People staying home scratchy throat want possibly spread might covid may have.    Someone model individual penis game *almost* forgive that. said not, word English people use?

Crosspost r/catastrophicfailure? Weird, least Home Depot one better stores. remember going Home Depot last spring mask use still bit contentious, surprised everyone masked store enforcing capacity limits. probably varies regionally, individual store! fact country supposed closest ally

We laughing stock world would anybody want help? Aren’t living shithole country Gucci belt? said would better without us.

Oh well. Florida: way ahead you, buddy Question?

Does override Biden’s mask mandate public transit?  500,000+ people dead even measures place, yeah let’s keep talking flu. Well, next pandemic. icecaps Tibet (which melting course) apparently house many many viruses. pro life. Godspeed Texas.  really mitigated things well places high mask compliance. ignore lack correlation case statistics mask compliance...  There's evidence vaccines actually reduce transmission too, proven before

But yeah, probably least kept mandates people vaccinated seem like issues get help OCD something  Lol y’all saying year now. vulnerable people getting vaccinated right now. It’s time let people decide risks willing take waited another 2-3 months. summer, majority Americans vaccinated anyone wants shot able get one. There's reason right now.  Florida Georgia continued decline since May.

Laughing ass  Ah, stupid then. Thanks laugh.  luckily chronic pain I'm sure going judge people looking relief. New Zealand Australia level lockdowns China seems agreement. Nobody stopping staying inside. Looks like another Randall Flagg  would that? mean come man     one shot J&amp;J, two shots Moderna/Pfizer, two weeks- pandemic you! pandemic end date different person. theory. Get rid one big main thing stops spread 100 yards finish line? Okay then. I'm Texas absolutely right Export proportionally amount purchased. It’s hard, country purchased certain percentage vaccines percentage production goes them.  Okay lot people still arent alive. missed point

Get head ""everything open masks"" gutter see reality It’s almost government mandates don’t effect natural curve virus. Shocking! Fauci say work.

He later said lied. Fauci said.

He said ALWAYS KNOWN masks work lie cause panic PPE shortage healthcare workers.

Again FAUCI says. 

Now better question Fauci 79 spent **entire career saying masks work claims ALWAYS known work**.

Be great reporter would ask Fauci explain it. Guess check 30,000 people still alive  Well Gregg Abbott moron That’s sure. That’s I’m going continue curb side pickup local grocery. it’s “these trying times”

Social distancing great me. social anxiety. one thing even think makes sense. ever sore throat cold last year pretty great. Prolly going keep masking on. one making go public places. mitigation efforts designed flatten (but elongate) curve virus spread. no, anything could make mess shorter. March 8, 2020 Fauci said reason wear mask. Sorry hurts feelings. Ah yes, mock real concerns something could actually happen  grocery store way knowing someone healthy not. Hence need require masks safe. Meanwhile sounds like mask successfully keeping snot kid rather spreading elsewhere means working planned. 

Meanwhile, wearing mask prevents none stuff wanted do. Making even clear objections mask wearing nothing reality instead internal selfishness preventing harmless act save lives. Texas continues exist despite hated cause told truth.

Edit: truly understand people love lockdowns. family members lost decades worth business progress strict lockdowns; state worse florida end. Lockdowns cause increased stress, mental illnesses, etc.. They're literally benefits lockdown unless small island pacific. Cool. 2 sparsely populated island countries. talking vast majority countries earth. still dealing able eradicate COVID mask wearing lockdowns. fact NZ entered another lockdown recently Iceland still strict travel restrictions community spread. really sure 2 locations contradict said. Florida middle pack deaths. Get facts straight. Nothing gained, nothing lost awesome. Time let folks decide risk factor. big box stores still require masks anyways.  don’t live healthcare setting you’re fully vaccinated, don’t quarantine upon covid exposure, according CDC. like ending 😔  didn’t know muscular dystrophy symptom covid. think need keep everyone house arrest relative died though, seems reasonable. VaRiEnTs God's sake, Manaus never reached herd immunity, city reached ""natural"" means. 70% stats hugely overblown due faulty studies political pressure reopen business city. Restrictions masks numbers double, triple, worse.

Your life maybe tied materialism looking way justify mass homicide, mine not. know people panhandle, Tallahassee check walmar. know people first coast (Jax metro area), there’s plenty Winn Dixie.
