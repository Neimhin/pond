0,2020-10-10," deserve die body can't fight minor virus. time get back normal. Survival fittest. Pittsburgh Could placebo vaccine 100% efficacious. Heck, I'd tickled pink 80% efficacious Covid-19 vaccine. rumors circulating online, even Reddit COVID China around dates. might first get outside China. bad mean gotten worse. I'm disappointed many downvotes got lol. thought funny *""good news""* they’re saying widespread mask usage would useful wearing think you’re around sick person isn’t enough.

So sounds like actually supports idea current climate mask wearing would help prevent flu spread Depends slice it. could mean things. start talking general approval mass distribution months, you’ll get clearer terminology this. Yes, that's exactly meant  masks effective worn? shock. wear mask... someone works government funded organization, underfunded. still use AS400 made late 1980s lot data. Super old Green text black screen. Trying get approval upgrades hardware/software already working good enough next impossible experience. shocked using outdated systems.

There also factor comes third party source. data they're sent likely fit parameters they're use to. unique identifier data SSN, would difficult auto detect duplicates without causing problems. specific software designed around data could probably done, coming 3rd party source. speculation, without knowing going on.

From experience databases sql, finding duplicates would pretty easy scripts. article say would fixed tomorrow though. fascinating manage condescending asshole feeling superior time. try empathy. History repeats itself. 2nd wave fall 1918 worst Spanish Flu four waves. Mood ok. 
More wearing mask now. least better 6 months ago wearing mask lol Show evidence. Yeah Mao red guard still running wild. Yeah, well happen. ""half ass everything rescued vaccine"" thing work well. kind fool thinking everything same, normal, really costs larger end. C'mon Pfizer! :) also people like you! We're US, cops tend that.

 works Germany apparently, think that's also bit Germans general. example, see many Germans jaywalking red light , do, there's chance someone reprimand you. goes corona rules. stereotype, often true

When girlfriend's parents got home holiday, obliged get tested remain quarantine could show negative test. second day already three police officers checking actually still quarantine, otherwise get massive fine. governments made much efforts enforce rules collecting parking fines, example. I'd say ""mild"" symptoms flu-like anything past lot worse. huge factor. already know steroids cut mortality risk. likely medications asthma patients taking reason data:. 
______
Although factors underlying findings yet known, important considerations include: possible biologic mechanisms ... **And possible protective effects asthma medications (such corticosteroids),”** Covid deaths aren’t tragic? fucking sociopath? Germany ICU beds EU far. Like 5-10 times country (e.g. DE - 60/100k, NL 6/100k). sure allows getting cases ICU less severe still serious sure isn’t meant least something enforcing quarantines allegedly exist (or existed) president shouldn’t unhinged begin trying push bullshit “states rights” “lockdowns ineffective” narrative deluded. low level trolling outright banned sub. So... evidence?

Also, want point fact changed counting methods multiple times revised death toll doesn’t give high hopes

Now around sub happened explaining since day, people still seem get it. go again.

When new mayor Wuhan came on-board saw lots suspected cases waiting queue PCR test, policy time need positive PCR test result confirmed case hospitalised, PCR test bottleneck time. Also time doctors already seen many lung CT scans almost 100% tell COVID-19 looking ""crushed glass"" foggy parts CT image. new job wanting get bad news way first put blame previous guy, new mayor allowed week new category patients called ""clinically diagnosed"" admitted hospital confirmed cases based CT image.

Many already CT done first see huge spike reported cases, gradual decrease CT image back log worked through. week new PCR test lab called ""Fire Eyes"" could run 10,000 PCR test day came online able handle new suspected cases show day well begin work PCR test back log, mayor stopped allowing ""clinically diagnosed"" went back requiring positive PCR test result count confirmed case.

A days pass Fire Eyes worked PCR test back log, including test results previously hospitalised ""clinically diagnosed"" patients, turned handful false positive CT image actually garden variety pneumonia, day correcting records patients removed clinically diagnosed false positive.

Then month pass COVID-19 dying Wuhan, medical staff went back double check records remove data issues like double counting patents hospital transfer, counted due procedure corner cutting time outbreak on, added bunch new cases case count retrospectively.

**In examples corrections actually increased case count Wuhan, decrease.** fail see anyone accuse government cooking books make look better despite fact change number exact opposite. elections India guess... hit nail head. starting cold weather states. Christmas going suck. Good job! thing talked enough many people get covid end w either loss warped taste long term. That's pretty big quality life issue imho. Vaccine far hopefully.... Yes, give hospital I'm Poland echo thoughts. think masks outside going lower infection rates. keep people compliant making sure indoors, much important. Cops really enforcing indoor use. threat ticketing people outside, hopefully increase indoor use.

I wish government would prioritize things proven higher infection rates. gatherings still allowed lot people. Many bars/clubs still open. Churches still full people. Literally nobody enforcing 50% capacity transit. Masks small part entire solution. wish done places proven hot spots. Yes, uncomfortable, burden. you, you’re special. Yeah, lol, info graphic reasonable estimates whole lot more. Obviously said, depends vastly population, looking give sense scale.

The “1 1500 Americans died COVID” (not deaths; 213k/320m) expanded hospitalizations, icu, ventilation, best estimates long term neurological, cardiac pulmonary symptoms. Sorry ruining party genuinely believe wont.  one , guarantee vaccine ready late 2021. two, economy be...well...in ruins.

It's less happens getting beaten hell. first might feel pain all, adrenaline. get home, adrenaline wears basically feel effects one one broken bones.

Same happen next year world economy...We'll feel full impact 2021. I'm glad moved years ago. Per capita home country Belgium twice many new cases single day new country NZ entire pandemic keep badmouthing Sweden fighting fight six months ago, entire world following Swedish model today.

France: locked 1,000 cases per day March, keeping schools open restaurants open 20,000 cases per day (corresponding 100k US)

And that’s great thing, got mass panic hysteria, we’re embarrassed admit it. that's case, Trump genuinely reflects Americans. Shenanigans Winter make spring look like picnic. Read /r/covid19positive - long-term symptoms like loss/warped sense taste &amp; smell months pretty common. Losing two five sense would huge QOL issue imho. see lot comments comparing numbers ones March, think correct. 
Yesterday 133k tests, march testing approximately 17k 5k cases likely comparable point time well march, still cases going going back mandatory masks restrictions.

I also see people referring Italy's trucks event march. talk without compassion, first: fuck you, second: really hope live situation, live city event took place, scary hell. Reported. YFDH Yep China could get away short lockdown aggressively fought outbreak lockdown. Otherwise get situation nearly entire Western world lockdowns longer sustainable people forced get severe community spread. ought thank Germany something did, forgot was... exist. would specific given population, massively affected demographics, specific locality, affected behavior policy too. Long-term effects unknown, many 3-6 month effects permanent, long-term. True. meant continuing rising case numbers right. wasnt total lockdown. allowed meet elderly outside. (Also inside called antibodies.) 

Swedens gdp fell 8 % average drop eu 50% higher. Doesnt matter though, didnt refuse lockdown save economy. Swedish Public Health agency responsible economy, dont care economy. however responsible public health broad sense, focus coronavirus. thought would cause suffering lockdown lock down. example reason didnt shut schools lack education serious consequences long run society individual children. Increasing inequalities, child abuse, asocial behavior, decreased mental health, increased wealth gap etc.

This might wrong decision reason, save economy, conspiracy, reach heard immunity insane reason. 

Regarding demonstrations, blanket ban gatherings 50 people police allowed demonstrations took place. complex police wont endorse demos however allowed break spontanious demos. several BLM protests example. 

As side note since bring Germany, think looks like well. Lockdown (as restrictions) scale. seem right amount restrictions, much little. god them! Dumb question: common lose hearing one ear due virus? Coupled FOXNEWS Yeah, compare facts see one way worse other. Probably expecting though  Even though economy factor Swedish response, overall health well-being population, it’s worth discussing measure “the economy”. 

Typically look GDP, gross domestic product, measure products services bought sold specific period. It’s really intended measure state economy in. 

That works ok’ish compare two similar periods time. doesn’t work **at all** circumstances. 

What happening right now, governments taking **huge amounts debt** distributing small big companies would otherwise go bust, individuals lost jobs subsidies paid sick leave, cash payments stimulate economy etc. etc. Subsidies packages like we’ve never seen before. 

Taking debt work time help temporary downturn, eventually need stop **is sustainable long term**. debt also need repaid point time. 

All GDP numbers thus inflated huge debt numbers. It’s financial artificial breathing subsidies CPR seeing right now. countries it. less. 

So saying country X detracted X% Q2 2020 comparing country Y, misses whole debt subsidy variable.

It makes sense comparing without looking debt created overall debt rate.


*Edit: clear, subsidies based debt point pandemic. It’s right thing do. let’s compare apples apples.* know. conversation ""muh Freedums"" guy backed Swedish plan. asked backing agrees social plans form government allowed Sweden take course did. said without irony got virus response right mean agreed policies. realize 2 intertwined.  IMHO mild weather mild cases people outside get lower viral load exposed. Cold weather higher viral load tend inside huddled together. sun supplies vitamin seems make difference outcomes. Less sun exposure winter impaires immune system. Let’s say reaction like got store owner fits profile see Dutch people without using actual words... Basically yeah, there's one spread to. get 50% vaccination only, say, 80% effective, reality 6 10 immunity good news? actually thr pesimistic end previous estimates. stay lockdown indefinitely, lockdown last measure stop IC going capacity. happens huge increase deaths. 

Also remdesivir treatment shown slow virus. medicine used different illnesses like dexamethasone has, mean know start pandemic work this. need time testing make sure effects are, time thankfully got lockdowns.

Lockdowns way eradicate virus. way slow it. is. it’s probably collective noun like “what data(set) says”. don’t ask individual *datum* say. ask whole set one. you. Everyone same, surprise! That, wait nightly reporting run. Sometimes fixing data hard, wait time slot reporting. bit old school, surprising. Numbers calculated per population meaningless. reason people say ""it tastes like chicken."" add something like contract tracing system right away, using cellphones. data already there, big brother already way whether accept good reason to. sounds spooky, would place emphasis individual responsibility larger good (sounds inconvenient unfun) happen. Add aggressive, short term targeted lockdowns, problem solved. care practical solutions much days, we'd rather fake it. several years same, virus hanging around large baseline numbers, mask fights, -30% economic tax, half-assed vaccines dubious quality (just take all, like 30 them) may actually confer long term immunity half population want. Enjoy. old people please stay inside die, youngs need fun. Oh no, sports! Anything sports! Absolutely. post ridiculously daft context.  also lying numbers earlier year. wife's work colleagues came back China late October 2019, worst ""flu"" life ended cough lasted 5 months sore chest month ago. cough throat bleeding peak.

*(in thousands years flu around, versus year Covid). US lockdowns provides limited supply masks limited online grocery services limit growth flatten curve.

Yet funding airlines, allowing theme parks remain open, advising leisure travel, many activities keep virus spread nearly every city town. long term, eventually 85 percent population infected. then, probably 3 4 million people US dead COVID-19 another 200,000 year die seasonal COVID flu would remain decades. Also, many people probably disabled infected. unclear often people get infected US.

Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand China seem know limit pandemic. lockdown India's ineptitude. made much worse. reason people taking precautions - wearing masks, sanitizing, social distancing, working remotely. ""rare"" without precautions. Black Death killed 50% people got infected humanity survived that. COVID, dangerous disease ignored kills less 1%. point Germany, one countries best testing systems, suspected missing 90% cases. Good. let like lab experiment. Let’s see many downplayers going get sick. least serve purpose gathering data stats.  Spoiler - didn’t pay off.

Number deaths metric measure success fighting pandemic. Obviously. Literally last night talk going well week past still close care. 90% another fake Trump optics thing continuing treatment hospital makes Trump look bad close election.

Even Christie dies, they'll wait announce election day. right, nobody listening you. done math COVID-19 estimate IFR. Early on, estimating 0.8%-1.2% IFR, based NYC deaths/antibody data.

When death count hit 100,000, still bunch people saying “oh, it’s 0.1% IFR!”

“Okay, 100,000 x 1,000 = 100 million Americans already virus? Right...” .028% maybe mean?? Well put. looking excess deaths period year year fine measurement. One lasting lessons pandemic.....never move Florida. COVID infected lot 0.5% population. Obviously country would better without Large protests allowed, large gatherings outside allowed. exact thing. 
How anyone say govt. implementing science based effective guidelines, mystery. see lot masks social distancing, lot microparticles. I'd imagine lot people wear masks believe covid spread larger droplets land 1 foot away; invisible particles stay suspended air long periods time. Hang there! Perhaps reframing situation terms things mom cares could help. Try get one piece end sight; years away. Look r/covidpositive awful. It’s shame took something like understand it’s scam. Still wouldn’t wish death anyone reason. I'm doggopoop one. assertive it, allow get point across without antagonizing much. know millions rational people silently support over, included. eyes, real heroes. That's external feedback accept opposed misinformed hate. doctor believes demon, alien, witch sex cause disease? Or, doctor know like, doctor planet earth? dancing around point. Let's try make little clearer: refusing wear mask equate nationalism. Wait case = murder?! can’t keep 🙈😅 Football Culture everything that's bad America. flu every year cause 200k+ deaths push hospitals capacity.

So...whatever numbers theoretical really matter clear illness causing far stress system things like flu. compounded illnesses injuries can't treated efficiently before. Nice , reminds 1500 climate alarmists “‘We're hearing people hearing loss part COVID infection,’ said Dr. Matthew Stewart, associate professor otolaryngology Johns Hopkins Medicine...Stewart colleagues performed procedures bodies three people died COVID-19 infection see could find virus inner ears.
In two three cadavers, found novel coronavirus middle ear mastoid bone skull, located behind ear. study published JAMA Otolaryngology -- Head Neck Surgery.
Stewart said viruses known cause sudden hearing loss, ‘personally I'm suspicious [the novel coronavirus] potential worse.’” Republican propaganda/lies lack education those? Please post/comment music links.

The earliest models (and cheapest ones) white &amp; black screens. pixel either OFF, middle points, grays, nothing between. one other,period.

The diverse color spectrum gets, complex expensive technology gets.

People's opinions works way. way cheaper easier black &amp; white guy live huge spectrum lays between. spent 25 years living South Bay. smoke, worst it. didn’t feel like home anymore. wish speedy recovery please stay strong countries these? Dr Phil Dr Proctor disease caused prolonged suffering course authorities let people die isolation. Butwhy.gif people like almost always counter ""well want us live like FOREVER?""  

No. want strong mitigation persist long enough science its' shot COVID though. 18 months mitigation followed return normalcy beats shit constant waxing waning floods COVID patients. (Reads ""family oriented culture"", cries Mexican). Staying beautiful southern fjord year round fish, camp, hike generally left alone idiots... i.e.: majority people living world. thought too. trump get quarantine something. true? Right Blimpie Subs shop... 1/3 got they’ll ignore even more. “Oh already got it, I’m good” Shit might really underestimated covid dude ugh dont social distance alot dint wear gloves facemask everhtime . done single test since biggining covid. flu blocked nose nothing seem serous. 

But crazy lowers oxygen level kill fast? cause lose hearing like posts  Yea that’s definition exponential growth I'm dude. greatest system. best technology best doctors world. Many people Europe (only wealthy ones course) come America certain treatments. fact expensive pretty shitty thats besides point. money want best go America. China take measures Western democracies cannot. Strong central planning authoritarianism much better ways dealing issues like COVID American institutions liberty federalism. That's say China better America, means America REALLY needs learn realize extraordinary, innovative measures need developed allow culture hinder response big threats like COVID. Well........................ shit. Tough shit. think guy worth tens billions given wealth (along Warren Buffets) Gates Foundation needs understand Covid keep charity ""solvent""? dumbest thing I've ever read. 

So we're supposed listen scientists....and tech nerds. bet every single dollar could save would way less business going business people took seriously..  


How that? way fucking cheaper wear mask avoid partying friends close entire cities outbreak let's dismiss every older person ""they're gonna die anyway"".

No dismiss drain society already caused enough problems. Meh, refusing admit countries simply care less enough. 

My comment definitely generalizing pointing general pattern, oversimplifying even implying successful countries simple ""simply shut borders indefinitely forever without completely destroying economies good"". 

It's denying things done better, better execution, personal government responsibility, mask mandates, social distancing..

Yes, Malaysian. illegal immigrants breach borders brought second wave, idiot politicians went campaigning spread second wave. point is, things perfect either, people try. 600 cases per day days ago people already concerned. 

A mall usually crowded city almost empty case reported. school reopened parents refused send kids school, even officially school close. random podcast 2 Malaysian comedians one living Europe also stated: ""White people simply care."" actually travel countries, see actual protocols serious governments population take it, know. Europe English speaking countries failed enough take seriously enough.

To put simply, people care, give shit, worry virus Europe yes ""anglophone"" countries (not ""anglophone"", France, Italy, Spain). 

Stop finding excuses failures actually take responsibility. Actual lives stake, something many seem forgotten. want beat thing, countries need start implementing New Zealand quarantine model.

Maybe international accord countries agree certain guidelines/practices gain privilege open borders friends visited Manitoba summer said that, could see, people weren’t really wearing masks. case? watch zombie apocalypse movie, kind containment situation break always happens human error. mean blame them? wife literally submitted letter resignation yesterday, 10+ years floor. offered significant “staying on” bonus many nurses also left.

Anecdotal, it’s happening across country Dude went uni today confirm registration crazy fully cramed ppl tiny spaces breathing other. offered either study online face face nopped choosed online Dont forget Dr Dre Dr Pepper trump Christie got medical care? wish nothing cum stain wall point live US, say 2016 election born.

Well one way go back oblivion, sigh *ties noose* I'm also Missouri daughter's 6th birthday party today, two grandparents guests masks. fact people throwing parties like blows mind. moment born living borrowed time. get logic here. Death inevitable. Nothing weird I'm posting bread way fucking better April. care post restaurant photo. live like another 6-12 months means even people area survive. dining pretty wild me. Like, love food. love good quality food. live without restaurants keep people safe. 

I born raised SF area man, miss times like these. favorite ""cases per three days"" metric... bullshit headline Good job NZ!! Jacinda done great job containing Covid outbreak there’s surprise flu nonexistent. end times People used thinking common figures speech 99% chance basically 100%. become dangerous misconception numbers actually related something important. Long haired dogs need shaved become matted able poop easily unable see. Ive tried possible. People really ok though. personal friends who've lost jobs stuck. vast majority people deal complex reality make changes routines every day achievable.

It's complicated task go full denial mode instead. easier. brains cope better. Same. Covid taste. Ugh. still comes goes.  point buying property cannot free travel NZ? feels 20 years younger right now! imagine we'll see elsewhere - masks, restrictions crowds, less people going bars restaurants (and reduced capacities those), work home - everything reduces Covid also reduce flu lockdown helping, right way. don’t think France Italy real lockdown. China lockdown right way, 8 days national holiday hundreds millions traveling around country. there’s breakout this, really contained it. exhale mostly mouth? live Bend, never restrictions came travel. city council put strongly worded letter deter tourism, ignored pretty much every Californian, zonie, Texan, tourists swarmed summer. taken 2.5 months Victoria Australia, one-fifth spread France currently That's point

It shows huge deterioration social distancing practices well effects quarantine fatigue

Europeans social they're tired af quarantine. relatives France basically reporting good majority starting give af I'm glad better. humans, need love  fellow citizens. problem argument chose Italy lot people large cities harder contain. Yet chose two populous states massive cities. point embarrassing many cases would need use scarcely populated state huge numbers. Yeah he's nutty, calling someone paranoid schizophrenia bit vindictive without knowing actually are. close friends schizo guy clearly due speech mannerisms. Delusional, yes, controlled opposition, probably. good points issues, stuff straight fiction. 5G thing beyond stupid. think cough kill me. 

I visited ward hospital serve committee member. far empty. heartbreaking. Let's hope, masks!! ik school gegaan daarnet point lockdowns first place get rapid testing infrastructure, contact tracing, PPE production, rest place

Oh wow, hard believe someone actually gets it. hilarious watching people argue pro anti lockdown, arguing ""flattening curve"" whatever ridiculous slogan day is, without actually correctly addressing lockdowns needed.

Bunch western countries blindly copying one aspect fighting without understanding works, complaining copied measure helping. turn tables. 0.013% population, setting mortality rate 2.6%, per numbers. deaths 1 serious illness. like coronaviruses seems long lasting protective immunity little sterilizing immunity. Frankly discount reality willful fear, pretending despite evidence reinfection worrying all. Victoria, Australia, 9 weeks ago averaging 470 cases day 6.4 million people. instituted severe lockdown 10 cases day, looking partially loosen restrictions soon. France's current spread (per capita) 5 times high back then. point lockdown thing works, must severe takes long time :(  .6 % far.... Nobody knows comorbidity future health issues. experienced hearing loss COVID19, gimme hell yeah! done rona, rona done us. Repost

Earlier discussion hahahah, yes please. this. heard got remdesevir, regeneron. Source please? Covid caused secondary pneumonia infections well. rest us resume daily life you? Interesting. Totally logical even know still discussion... Fauci getting fired 5... 4... 3... Absolutely! stay home aaallll time out. Can’t risk giving stuff grandma getting killed! One side, Twitter/Reddit collective, says listen CDC say ok.

The side says ""but CDC said ---- get interrupted Twitter mob leads confusion, leads people ignoring everything cause people interact socially online say CDC dumb. also say CDC right stuff want right. CDC says something normal people naturally listen to, mob says ""NO FIT VIEWS""

I almost got confused typing out. braindead hivemind Twitter Reddit want know things going right? wonder fuck why? 

Should listen CDC not? That's simple question yet get ""I'm terrified Covid, wear mask house"" crowd (which 90% users sub) goes tangent can't trusted. they'll tell exactly tho, quoting things CDC says lines views. 

Oh Fauci worshipped, quote followers God Fauci. Dr. McNinja? people die co-morbidities, different saying people co-morbidities die. still something avoid definitely death sentence. I'm sure totally buy that. issue right wrong sense morality virtually culture. think people want anti-science, people lack empathy, people ""team"" need ""win"", called losers. actually get problem.
 
You make sounds like there's actually two sides debate. like talking taxes, everyone different opinion, objectively correct answer. right wrong here. frankly, he's right, anti-mask idiots *are* wrong, i.e., wrong side history.

You past adversarial point. We're going accomplish anything dancing around snowflake's feelings. fact, wish could stop soft people. WTF gotten us? gotten us here, that's gotten us.

Plus, believe he's literally correct. history books *will* make point people anti-mask, *will* painted negative light. Well somebody tell pikachu fresh save life. Preface: read article, judging headline I'll accept live upside-down now. Cuz one's ""ominous""!!!! Gosh! hope you’re successful getting job doesn’t place family unsafe circumstances. 

If circumstances really dire try GoFundMe.com 


There solution. I’m sorry every person similar challenges going this. much dislike job, feel grateful it. makes worse. 1 every 100 get sick. get sick 1 every 30 die. don’t like odds. L/C liberal Swedish standrad still socialiberal US standard. Enough sanctimonious bullshit “saving lives” “taking responsibility”. don’t actually care anybody closest you. Newsflash: everyone else always been. You’re different rest us.

You’re afraid virus that, (not if) catch it, survive. someone immunocompromised, they’re free take precautions, like it’s since forever. Nobody else responsible you. hide house mask want. walk around full hazmat suit care. rest us getting back normal whether like not. scary.

Not soul chillingly terrifying begining pandemic know deal zero therapies actually worked (the idea put ventilators actually killed many people just... fuck man...). 

Thankfully figuring deal this, may able deal using yearly flu shot, hope pretty much totally normal life returning next year two.

At least, hope. Paging /u/popeyes_lover regarding state Dakotas. Tbf want philosophical weight creating new guaranteed suffer. Whether one agrees, something many people could least considering. 

Of course many become aggressive wrong way go it. blatantly sarcastic. Look username. Exactly. told death rate 2.8 currently per Johns Hopkins. didn’t get response. Midwest don’t believe masks social distancing “flu” *visibly panicking* socially distance well next year according life supposed right I'm ""proud American"". /r/prematurecelebration forgot population density well.  also remember Ferragosto August 15th marks massive two week nationwide vacation. people work least 2 weeks socializing, going beach, lingering coffee shops even usual, traveling, etc. cases circulating multiplying background month September plus back school time = shit hitting fan. 

That’s take anyway. Coffee shops bars worst one social distances properly. still see folks greeting hugs cheek kisses pass coffee shops. times like I’m glad don’t drink coffee drink alcohol cheaper home without side COVID. prove opposite! Absolutely. go work, see people dying disease high numbers. 

And go gas station see ten people bothered wear piece fabric faces minutes day. 

I barely see family, care them. 

I begging mom, autoimmune disease, go restaurants risky, 50% capacity thing hygiene theater. 

She told needs go eat people ""for mental health."" 

So lost it, *on mom*. I've dealing front line 8 months, watched every intervention get botched, stayed away people know if/when I'm going catch this. Let continue sacrifice *my* mental health go biscuit 80yo Nan. 

I feel alone. family acts like smallest inconveniences great sacrifice. want bad opinion family; love them! do, hurts. So. Bad. Change say 1 every 100 people get sick hits little harder. Percentages tend muddle peoples perception Geeze, guys league COVID right now. 

Their teams, opponents stay away arena ten days. That’s it. 

And wasn’t even shared players league. comforting even middle pandemic, people still priorities straight. fucking football game. actual positive effect wearing masks everywhere. Even slight advantage enough positive effect. Nun loses bearings car wild intersection. Good it’s ashamed apparently people hate living 1% 65-year old, changing factor 10 two decades age, easy rule thumb. may change factor (4?) based level medical care, much information that. 

The formula works 0.7% full population United States, less compatible we've seen here. would far lower many countries.  also works roughly 0 50% US (90% countries) least vulnerable, may hard get agreement handle even among experts. get lulled false sense security, seeing uptick cases, too. Hundreds Toronto alone! similarities mean ""is nothing like"" false. Florida gonna Florida. Oklahoma set record yesterday... set new one today. Ugh. think sick pay like 80% salary. people go bankrupt poor families still hurting bit. 20% reduction 50% reduction rent. ""And let tell you, Biden's car biggest turn signals ever. see like 200 feet away."" */immediately gets run car* sure point is? People allowed make comparisons effects different diseases. much likely get testicular cancer male pancreas cancer would still OK say pancreas cancer much worse higher death rate. Hope got everything dont assume sickness covid, flu season.

Exactly. Especially time, even understand symptoms watch for. Losing sense smell? Symptom. Lose sense smell clogged nose? symptom. Yes workers dealing public experiencing added pressures environment created COVID-19. People crazy ever before. crazy may always existed pandemic pushed surface. I’m Spain. We’ve done seriously stupid shit, country plays whole different league. It’s sad see. Yeah think needs protections place vulnerable certain point we’ll need open more. What? Dr. Fauci playing 5D chess  Hundreds children, mention parents grand parents neighbors community members risk one man becuase folk can't keep busy within household, choosing bounce people share risk -Giant racist know it’s annoying day I’ve flus before.  need robot enforcers humans aren’t put danger. Unfortunately, kind person ignores mask requirements also kind person dumb shit including shooting it. I'm North Dakota far I'm concerned 310 deaths nearly enough. thrown sun would higher kill rate.

But COVID dangerous you, individual level. Yeah interesting. remember seeing pictures people japan kid 1990's wearing masks public paying fresh oxygen vending machine. 

I thought wow that's odd place would never happen America.

🙃 I’m ashamed country too. You’re alone. thought whole idea COVID like flu, flu didn’t vaccine proper treatment. They're also wearing get infection level levels fully re-open. Wearing mask saves economy.

From June: [National mask mandate could save US economy $1 trillion, research says US neared many cases everyone uproar. India gets there, everyone feels sorry. Hmmm adversarial. morons living alternate reality incompatible actual one rest us living started fight. 🤷‍♀️ watched old ""the newsroom"" clip climate change. Scared bejesus outa Oh wow Smeden large spread FHM downplayed situation beginning, allowed 30000 visitors European song contest March 7th. on.

They gave even started. day, Sweden suffered lot initial herd immunity strategy.

So many mistakes made. Stop trying cover up. laughed god damn hard comment. Lmao fucking swing-and-a-miss. Worldometers us 50k, even without FL. I'm ashamed whenever CDC says something suits hiveminds narrative, social distance, they're quoted, sourced, praised. CDC says 10k died solely cause Covid masks really effective, hivemind wants lose collective shit.

So it? Listen CDC want listen say, verbatim call day? think meant individual basis, diseases much worse. Obviously COVID-19 presents risk personally Ebola disease self much worse. really nonsense all, he's completely right. Democrats conservative, Wilson conservative, ergo assuming things remain (this actually silly part) he'd Republican today.

This, course, throws nuance window. we're painting broad strokes, /u/seannemairi correct. Stop pushing eradication narrative. getting really annoying. It’s feasible country. Sooo release data provide context? Seems pretty simple? Sounds similar USA set up. 50% population average intelligence, another 10% aren’t much smarter.  remaining 40% many hampered drug alcohol abuse, limited opportunity good education, due political religious affiliation reject fact based education?  leave us with, maybe 10% population requisite capabilities? 

Of remaining 10% people proper focused education capable understanding what’s happening COVID.    

I’m lucky wife Masters Biochemistry, cousin PhD virology PhD Synthetic Biology, good tutors.   also participated pandemic exercises Homeland Security, part job, know models tell us.  

Take vitamin D/K vitamin C, it’s best hope beyond great mask, social distancing, good hand hygiene.   

Flu season going awful, awful, May next year could easily 1M dead, especially states re-opening.   

When hospitals get overrun, people forced stay home get proper care death rate go 5, 10, 15x it’s easy entire families die. Sorry, made clear. Although study looks cross-reactivity SARS 1, that's I'm interested in. fact SARS 1 demonstrated 17 years immune response (first page title showed SARS-recovered patients (n=23) still possess long-lasting memory cells reactive SARS-NP 17 years 2003 outbreak

I'm merely saying SARS-COV-2 related SARS 1 4 common cold coronaviruses therefore trying draw conclusions long specific immunity (not cross-reactive immunity) would seem better served comparing SARS 1. Thing is, everyone gets different. don’t wear masks protect easy cases, people suffer maybe even get long lasting medical issues. personally experience nothing like flu. terrifying. heart problems, shortness breathe, headaches, everything. 
I lot things, never scared virus. cautious it, sure, never scared. I’m young, shouldn’t been. 
Let’s say I’m scared lol. 6 months Wilson promised American people re-election America would enter war. got elected reneged promise started commission spread anti German propaganda. beginning USA involved Americans anything bad say Germans weee diff us Americans. Towards end entered American visceral hatred Germans. plenty time resources stop pandemic sooner rather later. can't produce quote add assumptions opinions.

Just one question understand position. COVID sick binary you- someone either dies fine- between? Okay, that's good hear, standard obviously gold standard determining effectiveness specific drug part treatment illness. (In double-blind study, doctors patients know given treatment given placebo; researchers know.) good standard observe determine progress disease complications symptoms one observe recovered it.

For studies deal drugs progression illness, double-blind study work. example, trying determine someone severe smallpox could experience recovering illness, could made double-blind placebo-based? ""double-blind placebo-based study"" insist proof accept, doctors patients would unaware smallpox. would set up? could give smallpox virus people way neither doctors patients would know it? simply impossible. Yet know great degree certainty happens someone smallpox. know that? observed patients collected analyzed observations.

An example factual knowledge one common side effect measles elimination ""resetting"" body's antibody ""memory,"" making one susceptible diseases previously immunity. double-blind study ever determined this, could used determine this: determined observing measles patients course time.

The current studies following COVID-19 patients collecting data seem indicate mental, cardiac, and/or respiratory problems significant number patients who, testing positive symptoms illness ranging mild serious, test negative illness positive antibodies. 

I'm aware Fauci considers drug studies double-blind flawed various ways gold standard, would scientists. every scientific medical study drug trial, believe demanding: demanding observations illness exclusively tied double-blind drug studies, observations ever used considered valid. summarized position correctly?

Certainly, aggregate data post-COVID-19 patients, treatments used provide invaluable data help determine minimize adverse health conditions following recovery. can't double-blind, would patients healthy patients COVID-19, neither patient doctor could know which. plainly impossible, means studying data used. 

We'll use double-blind placebo-based randomized trials drugs, observe happens patients COVID-19, must use measurements observations see someone COVID-19 different someone never COVID-19. Trump literally stated wears mask though Given pretty open racist seems pretty likely! Living Melbourne, Australia getting 700-900 day, 9-15 month(ish) masks become compulsory. thankful live USA. Masks work LSU isn’t even good Well...they’ll chomp, chomp whole swamp filling it. exact equivalent saying ""I'm wearing condom refuse live fear"". scared get COVID? Hell yes, scared seriously ill, scared suffocating, scared dying, scared long term health issues. importantly scared reason someone else suffers things. fear (a normal healthy human emotion) live entire life fear. thank encouragement! yes don’t hesitate consistent holding everyone accountable even it’s hard. i’m sure many team really want speak much anxiety advocate security it’s responsibility keep them, take seriously.

It surprise nothing, pandemic included, stop getting kids ice. 
These people bat shit crazy! *only* enough money. Yes. don’t take home realise get thru airport get thoroughly tested would take people 18 hours released. idea meticulous are/were handling virus. difficult humans create viruses. used weapons, need create one. lot viruses used. rather die live state much respect human rights China.

Also, don’t grocery shops pharmacies delivery services?

""Wait two weeks covid"" got results. Now, could Zealots possibly get rapture actually listened medical recommendations? countries referring to? US line typical countries. You’ll see lower death rates countries younger populations obvious reasons. US testing ton people there’s really nothing wrong testing saturation  It’s unquestionably good thing flu nasty thing suffer still causes death. hurt us long term? really. may make making vaccine right candidate next year flu season harder sample size people getting smaller, vaccine would still effect provide protection, perhaps much efficacy dominant strain easy identify. 

I think public’s education terms avoid COVID (people know better far stay away sick people, people hopefully going likely stay home sick, better hand hygiene people may even choose wear masks crowded places sometimes) couple together think put real dent flu next years. lived NL 12 yrs yes one pretty strict. played sports league teams villages areas would barred playing games Sundays. places even drive om Sundays. 
They political party religious core recently women MP's even advocated say. USA!!!! #1!!!! :( Sydney Melbourne lot worse Auckland. leaders belong prison this. recent reinfections.

Look virus airborne means, notice wearing masks made difference countries' infection curves. Doctors (not pharmacists) administer shots areas Large event limits postponed Context clues 🙌  Sweden could have, chose to. They're example do. Africa's cases rising now. guidelines advise masks anyone showing symptoms go (maybe get food medicine).

Not sure point - arguing masks? I'm someone gets immense pain arm scratching myself: (not sure why, I'm sure related injury sustained shoulder years back)

I'd still rather take shot (username related). 闲着也是闲着，测测安心 case numbers rising, albeit two weeks behind europe. forget though, virus weaken time indistinguishable common cold (among coronaviruses already rounds). vaccine might last long, prepare immune systems get sick mild variant year later, much better chance fighting off, especially additional treatments.

Here New Zealand, eventually need let virus run course, hopefully time happens, death long term injury virus thing past vulnerable. overruled hours press conference article university president athletics director...

Will wonders never cease? American university president AD actually value lives students football W/L record, good them. hope drummed NCAA outrageous principled stand! Australia NZ seem world leaders combating covid. Hard lockdowns early gradual easing. Apart Melbourne. Also compilant population unlike states. Even flu shot, nasal spray version essentially phased due issues flu shot screaming last week 😂😂 I’m late 40s husband pharmacist crying laughter. hate needles. it’s don’t mind thought before. rally yesterday showed symptoms. would argue many special education students trusted person aid assist home time.

Gonna play little devil's advocate here: special-ed students *don't*? 我靠，又全民检测？这药够猛哦。 get it...... Guess what, get Covid you’re going die loneliness anyway since one visit hospital.... problem everyone can. everyone receive level care even close it, largely part policies promoted party. know...I like throw term 'Death Cult' around little played. said, seems many Christians mood test God's word really shouldn't. stupid shit expect God come save ass, don't. That's M.O. let ass sit stupid boat made. 

Friendly reminder Christian God fan hubris. similar disease control agencies Scandinavia believes. interesting actually. showing symptoms, know, stay home recover. think might over. People needed forcefully educated. still hate wearing yes, bad me. area area Holland, MI Grand Rapids, MI littered Protestant Calvinists Dutch Reformed Church persuasion. produced notable people Betsy DeVos. When? another ruling last part September done back spring “unconstitutional”. really matters point one considering (but far know still planning overturned, one thought going stick anyway). believe you, hadn’t heard it. Got link me? 
This last heard (and actively looked — zero media around area covered all): 
 



I think Wolf Whitmer two governors best job Covid response nation-wide (NY, NJ, MA, etc decent well, bad things already happened states). thing wish Wolf differently beginning (that could actually control. testing, contact tracing, PPE clearly needed everywhere federal government actively hampering do........) much proactive regard nursing homes. yes. well, considering working with. awhile ago, saw redditor make post saying something along lines of, “I love wearing mask, people don’t see ugly face…”

And thought myself, “Who hurt you” lol Unless referring something else, [the CDC advise masks anyone showing said ""No recommendation made time mask use community asymptomatic persons""

Part advice, I'm guessing, comes fact masks seem effective worn carrier, person might infected. Repost.
Discuss original post Returning normal means eradication dude actually live Sweden.

It much social democratic.

That bad thing. Death, longhaulers colds think surface transmission can’t ruled possible source (unless know certain neighbour cold case likely that). so, much capacity allow people get intensive care even cases mild.

You really see look U.S. data. U.S., steady decline number deaths per occupied hospital bed peak second surge COVID19, death rate started increase again. 

At time, doctors reported better treatment methods younger patients. could deaths relative hospital beds increase people younger treatment better? 

It almost certain taking lower-risk patients. Then, situation became severe, hospitals started give beds serious cases. Everyone different. hate wearing reasons anyway true. culling time CCP China. anything? It’s preventable. yet governments prepared needed stop it. It’s value western lives others. tho, stores open question hand is: measures place, much spread reduce (or increase causes people follow measures less) marginally mask mandate. really see answer studies COVID scale measures place Western societies since Spanish Flu primarily behavioural question. one denies masks better masks reducing amount virus contagious person gives off. going closed space close distance longer time contagious person probably infected either way unless use medical grade masks short supply. able follow distance keeping hygiene measures probably infected either way. lead virologist held Norwegian research indicating high infection rates, 5000 people wear masks stop one infection. can't speak asian culture personally stigma thing huge US. People wont even tell others made contact tracing extremely difficult infamous words Comey:

**That's it?** irrelevant article, obvious read it. government expects test 800,000 people. genophage cure type shit, need shroud facility. Color skeptical.

Tried influenza vaccine past lessor results.

I'll take needle one science skeptic longer fucking things every turn. Shut damn schools.

They killing teachers kids. Vicovid: takes away pain well, it'll take breath away! got covid, get covid, everyone gets covid!!! wear combo? circumstances? 

At uncrowded grocery store state low community spread everyone masked wearing properly? 

Or 6hr flight? 

Or you’re getting chemo? country right Immunity lasts months

source please. 
 virus airborne *so masks largely ineffective* 
 
source please. Event 201 World Economic’s Forum 2021 “The Great Reset” already knew you’re critical thinker (“conspiracy”) shake head say “omg what’s going on?” attitude problem. data, possibly study know safety measures truly working? political, pandemic need know facts. Stop deadliest pandemic humanity seen someone poke tiny hole body closes within seconds.

Tough call. asthmatics take corticosteroids. reacted earlier, saw first wave hit labs, hospitals.
After bungled away successes weeks behind developments France.  plan place ~2003 till 2016 half plan 2018 plan. bad. Please vote. Really? article speaks millions children malnourished going without food due lockdowns, think Trump matters? almost like been, *gasp* health theater.

This airborne virus going away. Better hope vaccine quicker. true, mostly opinions cable news, point answer ignore news choose believe whatever want. That's what, political faith? hate state isolation restricted access instituted security measure.

Argentina: Yes case France vast majority territory infection cases. That's lockdown better discriminated. entire territory fire lockdown coming..  would believe North Korea reopen boarders No, posting PROOF ban evading smart. it? See ya next account, yeah? hope another Theranos type fraud. Friends Trump? Easter right around corner. french one military checked papers went buy groceries? 
Didn’t highest ever spike? 
Or Italian one mentioned didn’t almost 7000 cases day? stated squandered time. Please see article. explains. There’s data lockdowns causing large number deaths many reasons, surely large amount hardship, poverty, hunger, abuse, serious issues. shall see pans able look back. “Fear bad press slowed canceled school reopenings elsewhere”

“Democratic governors love flaunt pro-science bona fides comparison anti-science Trump administration don’t seem aware growing body evidence.”

I find article unnecessarily antagonistic towards people trying keep kids teachers alive. 6 feet, precise. think they’re right western world controlled class people that’s different class people control china. working class may want us look like china country can’t it’s hands. literally saying time can't know this. said *could* like that, could also not. predictions literally predicted bump cases around time. I'm sorry like entire quote provided World Health Organization. Truly. Rather reflexively argue quote, consider Nabarro made comment, however? ""Arthur, plan"" Well, comment obviously joke. preprint couple weeks ago claimed thing PCR instruments set detect viral load low, authors claimed may infectious. Speculation viral load much load given point incubation would infectious almost pointless. something measure without sort challenge trial. Estate sales winter weeeeee! rapid antigen tests least accurate early detection. took one couple weeks back (2nd hand exposure) technician said need wait least 5 days date exposure, preferably 7. Traditional PCR test sensitive take day earlier, depending lab turn-around time may wait 2 4 days results. specialty PCR labs claim 12 hour (same day) turn around, they're pricey like $100/pop available big metros. ELI5? one lengthens need lockdowns. everyone wore masks 2 week lockdown would fine Specifically, President United States America fully embraced pseudoscience wishful thinking, simultaneously receiving around clock medical care based actual science. think writing reasonable things conservative breaking law? Make sure use bleach. def let back in. Also thats good way kill everyone else's grandparents. Take let stay going that. temperature least 140 degrees. no, guys going that. 


how ineffective masks? read actual study, even used correctly talking 16% reduction risk infection wear one properly every day 30 days. know people want that's enough stop contagious upper respiratory infection, slow little bit. herd immunity strategy, inevitability. hell ""squander time"" have, time now, flattened curve well capacity. all. would much rather live nation coronavirus part daily life live nation controls society like Chinese government. Fuck that, coronavirus isn’t worst thing happen country.   waiting game vaccine maddening.  No, part critical thinker ask “what angle / agenda author article reading? 

Even normal circumstances, author’s beliefs politics could definitely influence writing. since virus responses unfortunately politicized - writer’s political direction absolutely relevant. cable service CNN, I'd get rid also.


No way I'm paying cable rates one channel. It’s interesting right wing US talks lockdowns problem freedom, yet lockdowns affect poor people US most. rich work home aren’t affected. left typically champion poor working class (or presented be) yet overwhelmingly lockdowns. course, right vs. left US much complicated that, especially current climate. 

I can’t see WHO’s statement wouldn’t apply US well, say liberal. certainly enough poor people.  claims immune First website distorted sources pretended quote. estimates also suggest 6,000 children could die every day preventable causes next six months result pandemic-related disruptions essential health nutrition services.

This transformed so-called article say definitive ""6,000 children die today"" that's quite cherry picking compared report says recent estimates based modeling.

What also leaves prior pandemic, roughly 3400 children risk dying due food insecurity.  (That's extrapolating numbers report, says 149 million people countries listed affected food insecurity pre-pandemic, number estimated go 270 million).

This tragedy regardless numbers, whether 6000, 3000 1. 

But world care much pre-pandemic, would suddenly start caring now? true. That’s probably couple dozen comments here. one knows say doesn’t fit Reddit mold panic, restriction, big government overreach. added conversation something completely different. “defining vacations” chose keep going reduced farming causing poverty malnutrition. 


Look, one saying lockdowns primary mitigation. don’t think anyone ever said that. Unfortunately, people don’t follow rules fir primary mitigation measures, made lockdowns temporarily necessary Sorry clearer post. I’m surely fine recommendations maybe restrictions place HIV positive patient. I’m ok illegal everyone sex weather HIV not. That’s insane. continue restricting people aren’t positive? can’t even gatherings certain places even everyone already disease. make sense?


Furthermore, see reports secondary effects lockdowns restrictions gatherings. There’s serious concern restricted gatherings effect people’s mental health. lockdowns decrease economic activity leading hunger third world countries. banning elective procedures decreases cancer diagnosis. already know viruses trigger post viral illness people, known decades. medical community refused acknowledge instead pushed ""psychosomatic"" angle every turn. post viral illness would taken seriously 30-40 years ago would treatable/curable today thousands people suffer silently every year ME/CFS, POTS post viral sickness.

People acting like new phenomena caused covid. not. know someone awful fatigue brain fog following flu completely dismissed doctor said mental referred psych. Malpractice like still going today. look r/cfs subreddit, tons previously healthy active people came virus *never got better*. medical community still refuse acknowledge thing happens. Autoimmune neurological conditions (many post viral) notoriously underdiagnosed underfunded comes research. wasnt long ago MS thought mental well.

If want get permanently screwed covid unable doctors believe instead mentalize symptoms, wear damn mask socially distance. want end like people r/cfs whos lives taken away virus malpractice ignorance medical community. Well obviously can’t leave lay public try keep people healthy Tennessee lay public worried whether get nails done watch football game bar. (Not saying government officials better least “control” potential keep people safe) Testing United States surged rapidly 1,000,000+ tests everyday, that's we're getting 50,000+ positive tests daily, still hella 5.0% positive rate. Better later Additionally, Moncef Slaoui stated "" expectation really something 80% 90% efficacy "". higher previously expected. great, huge news true. But... but... Trump must've gotten rid oversight personally planning ensuring cabinet members pocket money.

Why else would go way make sure one could track money went? Testing done sufficient numbers able contact trace inform decision makers whether localized lockdown warranted. nationwide lockdowns developing nations merely recognition resources necessary keep check otherwise. recommendations unrealistic given actual situations underdeveloped world. Great theory, useless practice. Additionally, impact tourism industry inevitable wealthy westerners traveling. little lockdowns imposed underdeveloped countries. live things open. I'm grand ole time able go out. type vaccine great shedding, making likely spread others week following use. Typically used live virus form. country’s leaders besides US really harped fact virus originated China? 

It doesn’t seem like EUs major leaders finger wavy US. competent don’t need point fingers distract gross negligence. I’m familiar EU news. would compare countries half-assed measures still struggling contain benefit kicking 3 months road?

Yeah, imagine that, countries less social responsibility Nordic countries struggle maintain shown benefit lockdown flatten curves. Yet somehow think countries actually emulate Sweden's strategy?

Also, think countries swamped COVID cases actually well economically? Even Sweden escape Q2.

Just fyi, criticisms China got draconian measures, they're essential COVID-free actually saw +3.2% GDP growth Q2. acknowledge opposition science coming Republican party USA conservative parties countries stupid, irresponsible detrimental health wellness people represent. irony ""pro-life"" people easily disregard million plus lives lost due pandemic. Pure stupidity. Nevertheless, virus care vote abide science run risk sickness death themselves, friends, neighbors, families, coworkers everyone else come contact with. People refuse wear masks social distance selfish assholes, like idiot leader party put blind faith into. constitutional right move around, travel, trade meet. national lockdown would illegal Sweden.

Freedom assembly freedom demonstrate may limited interests preserving public order public safety meeting demonstration, regard circulation traffic. freedoms may otherwise limited regard security Realm order combat epidemic. seems competent lawyer could make case Swedish constitution allow temporary curtailment certain freedoms order combat epidemic. it’s pure nonsense. one thing people ages 20-30 probably less 1k died this? Maybe less 10k? that’s globally. original source isn’t great, happening. hunger leading deaths 10,000 children month first year pandemic, according urgent call action United Nations shared Associated Press ahead publication Lancet medical make confusing, plenty families Dutch extraction within old German religious communities became Pennsylvania Dutch. Statistically, locations don’t lockdowns getting high number deaths new cases every day Give one example lockdowns used primary mitigation?

No, aren’t. many, many Covid deniers people parrot talking points often poorly sourced understood information.

Speculating scorned. 20 percent number almost certainly garbage. Instead running popular news report, taken seconds takes find actual paper.

You care tone Even right, tone matters correcting misinformation. People listen tone reasonable context.

I don’t care think tone. information read anyone.





If think I’m uncivil, report me, I’m done tone policing.

Laters. shit gets sprayed us en masse without consent.... Texas barely locked top 5 leading deaths nation we're back! (bet sorting r/Coronavirus new)  read article (I know know, still believe possible) note quotes huge number studies, world, done real scientists. ""follow science"" really follow science. science nature changes conclusions time care politics.

That said, science good, there's big problem. sample comes back low viral load (CT 35), could mean there's non-infectious remnant, article suggests, could way gotten infectious load level yet. depends infection occurred. There's excellent chance either way infection dangerous actual patient, simply know patient gets another test whether infectious. awed differently people respond stimulus. varied species are. Texas among states either. People sub trust experts fits narrative, works ways. matter far reach expert makes, I've seen single pediatrician Baltimore talk virus living freezer people freaked fuck here. I've seen articles oceanographers, HVAC experts, kinds garbage. never ends here. like threw farming discussion vacations, haha. wrong here. Sensational headline, context, Political right leaning supporting source use. think also purpose without fact checking and/or reading article... even worse read purpose. nvm. Nothing new article tbh... headline misleading context. Like often shit...

Stay safe, wear mask follow local rules minimize spread Somebody may try mock say I’m anti-science conservative...

But really comfortable government kind control lives several months thing? Yes serious got uppity Dude, stop believing spreading lies. great deal narcissism stories. feel sorry family members pressured going house weekend refused take precautions.

I’ve read several stories like one. one feel international avoidance rules family early New Jersey March.[New Jersey Bariatric surgery everyone BMI 30 Well. design skeeters attack without antibodies?

If would welded doors maybe wouldnt standing infront virus apocalypse.  think Queen pretty cool gal. Eh rules peasants afraid anything. really shame people fixated measure tiny effect, considering tracing studies overwhelmingly point almost infections happening prolonged indoors contact, passing someone seconds street. energy instead invested pushing measures actually work, everything limits people meeting indoors: closing pubs bars, forcing office rats work home time etc. mean work work. need make things even complicated happens curve rises again? Time another 5-month lockdown! Flattening curve plan, otherwise, would use time prepare. make sure curve stays flat, pushing problems road. Keeping curve flat thoroughly planned locking people two months highly unnecessary Fake news... Ill think reason later. 😳 already proven spread warehouse grocery store workers packaging imported frozen food, China banning specific Brazilian Ecuadorean producers since June.

Edit: Also German Argentinian producers. food inside apparently ok cooking anyone regularly handles packaged/uncooked product needs get weekly coronavirus test. LOL oh guys fucking hilarious Nobody wants lockdown idea one would necessary based hope evidence reason. 

This idea pushed people pro-lockdown vice versa. reality countries cannot use lockdowns repeat strategy, especially proven methods designed keep exponential curve down. least got try. least make official policy. Obviously that's going put massive dent vs nothing. Unfortunately strategy waiting vaccine work either. years tested, approved, manufactured, shipped administered enough people make difference See Israel example...early masks/lockdowns...no effect.

Small country.

There factors. simple lockdowns/masks work everyone 100% compliant. 

See Philippines well. See Panama. Kuwait. Qatar, etc..etc.. interesting actually.

""Interesting"" way teeth removed without anaesthetic is.

Look graph: realize everyone went away holiday week coming back.

Kids school, unmasked. Masks suggested stores, one wears them.

It's clusterfuck massive proportions. Yes. Masks work. wouldn’t suggest rely solely mask crowd people can

Acting like paper isnt germane demonstrates lack understanding. yeah! pence makes think one word time whenever see ""embalming"", great example embalment done well - well got done early.

May bring whole EU. think sre basically restart go back rethinking many things.. Due constitutional right freedom religion, government unable force churches limit number churchgoers 30

Bullshit. argument safety laws would apply churches, like building codes.

Notice RIVM continues say masks worthless. Note Rutter continues avoid sort actual legislation, quoting ""Constitution"", without explanation.

No, issue Rutte spineless non-entity willing take stance all. result mass death us.  Spare rod, spoil child, make spare rod. Trump flagged lead source COVID misinformation. president went claim vaccine could become available “during month  way virus works 20% people responsible 80% spread. people super-spreaders infect dozens people, people infect one.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, still hit 90 deaths today. Seems like lot Sunday. Frankfurt last year December, loved theirs.

Same. 5 year old daughter pathologically shy lockdowns I’ve never seen comfortable around kids month. like Swedes made minds, amirite? thing. already isolated-why would stop? way right health also ones choice forfeit right going church.

And went church, got covid there, visit place appriopriate advised regulations like distancing wearing mask LEGALLY nothing wrong.

So collision rights bc going church willingly knowingly forfeit right.

And totally agree common sense prevail problem ""commons sense"" law. Hey Swedish defend swedish strategy, know world wont take kindly grotesque evil. Shhhh, doesn’t fit narrative.  real story record current hospitalizations impending deaths result. Remember Dr. know, guy wrote clickbait garbage ""masks years even vaccine"" article MarketWatch?&lt;!

Yeah, probably remember him. I’m boat. want get COVID vax comes out, especially it’s going seasonal thing, won’t able it’s nasal spray use live viruses immunosuppressed body wouldn’t handle well don’t masks work? *shocked Pikachu face* really freaking hope so. Here's wishing Believe not, it’s possible Democrat skeptical nuking way life grandma gets years... actually great idea would able pick Australian challenge duel citizenship! basically gone.

Turns welding door actually right fucking thing do. everything doing. Seriously. 

Until recent localized lockdowns Europe, nobody locked since jun

And even that, weren’t really locked down. couldn’t go restaurants. Drawing blood hard, get red marker something like it, scribble paper. /s blaming one another wearing masks going vacation equivalent blaming global warming neighbor sorting aluminum cans... antibody prevelance among blood donors indicative prevelance general population, donors self-selected. example, lot people think Covid seek blood donation testing, could make results artificially high. blood donors tend scientifically minded follow precautions average, could make results artificially low. need true random sample study understand real prevelance, estimate prevelance state. going compare worst responses world, come *marginally* better, real insight provided? 

No, claiming provide ""perspective"", offering biased comparison. Perspective needs sides claim illustrated. hand medals great Pandelympics...

In case, almost every first world country locked down. can't argue things definition; lockdown defined taking away people's freedom movement, nothing else.

It's like losing weight getting rich. Simply saying ""I therefore too!"" disregards many important factors things different, simplifies comparison meaninglessness. easy NZ mean easy everyone, obviously.  Brutal!!!!!

I LOVE it!! like things see better do. Yup. First come cases, come hospital, comes morgue. basically bordetella. Yeah, even though 2020, suspect covid-19 wiki page still end giving huge range deaths, like every pandemic! going pics alone looks like there’s vent breathing out. that’s case, totally defeats purpose wearing mask. you’re able freely expel unfiltered breath you’ll spread COVID much weren’t wearing mask.  

Please tell I’m wrong isn’t vent. killing host antithetical survival reproduction virus. host dying immune system fighting off. Ehm. Google   never see massive uptick states already peaked. virus pretty much done states. Herd immunity probably achieved them. mainstream media done that? even substance approach. Quite irony lecturing someone else then. fact remains Sweden's neighbors best comparison, work *you* completely contradicts narrative. Pity.

You want countries compare to? There's China, South Korea Vietnam. Add Australia list well. referring (and directly replying to) prospect 2 million dead now, entire point statement.

He certainly agree many countries death rate like US's actual current one. didn't. Read full comment chain next time fall called straw man. OP said US really harps origin China. brings example Australia well indicate due Australia's history US pawn. brings countries want know origin virus read article even name China resolution. different op's claim. Australia distinguishes calling question China's transparency calling investigation China handled pandemic. UN resolution ask either name China all. this. Would text message people remember saying anything. Would find car intersection forget driving why. didn’t realize happening causing forgot refill prescription week. Medicine scary. decrease traffic related fatalities due less travel Thanks ANOTHER update DR. GATES. lol ridiculous. Unless plan never opening borders you’ll going go lockdown again
And inevitable waves cases show up. It’s delaying inevitable. Sadly think many cases is. Doesnt mean shouldnt still better/more PPE reduce chances, seem even small fraction chance eventually enough working long hours months end. 

I friend pharmacist, family take COVID seriously. wears mask, shield glasses day work tested positive. NYC'er here, made worst without contracting far know (antibody test negative). Wife living life ""normal"", simply going eat/drink inside restaurants. wear masks go inside shop outside people around.  overly cautious thing stick wearing KN95's, Mostly worry things, know I've done best avoid it.  Also trained get used wearing fly cross country recently (no issues).

Just wear mask indoor around people pod, outdoors close strangers wash hands generally OK.

Think way: Health care workers spend entire shifts around sick people long proper PPE careful avoid contracting it. Furthermore healthcare workers consider exposure close (under 6ft) contact 15 minutes WITHOUT masks someone disease.  intents purposes avoid (preferably all) conditions ""relax"".

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide I’m arguing bad faith, points don’t make sense me. Saying China well certainly take I’m going go with. others, lots countries (the UK, Ireland, etc.) implemented lockdown, test trace, also distribute PPE. countries clearly done nearly well others, that? Others, like Japan, Korea, etc. didn’t implement lockdown test trace, PPE, etc. relatively low number cases. Watch ill-informed masses attack vaccine equally ill-informed reasons, 'causing Autism'. 280k update seems date, 22/aug (7 weeks ago). Must calculated bit differently. 7?!? Lol that's awful! I'm glad levels getting closer.


I lot fatigue, brain fog, period issues, etc. improve thyroid treatment thought vitamin d. fatigue brain fog improved cut dairy gluten. “smart” big part was, myself, people. feel dumb front them. It’s frustrating husband forget things asks do, can’t follow shows/movies wants watch together, can’t conversations complex topics easily used to.

I feel hardcore, brutal. Like you, used really smart, accomplished, great public speaker, forth. I'm chronically ill bunch stuff, affects cognition terribly. Especially ability speak. went speaking like politician running office someone lucky string sentence together without stammering forgetting words. absolutely humiliating know everyone sees much struggle find basic words speak coherently. Every time start falling want cry.

I also hope temporary people terrible thing experience. soon knew people China, Japan, Hong Kong, etc. wearing masks, household started wearing them. actually bought sewing machine learned sew mid-March, made 200 masks. 

Well, comes washing food/objects - best knowledge, western nation advising this. doesn’t mean proper precaution... again, think couldn’t even find toilet paper, paper towels hand soap months. Imagine population (in country) advised sanitize everything. Panic would ensue, largely due anywhere near enough supplies. would also put another nail coffin economy.

I agree you, though. make political - losing 2016 presidential candidate office right told people wear masks, think lot mask/covid deniers would behaving completely opposite current reality. president people would come early properly communicated everything along national organized strategy, would much different position right now.  aren’t enough cases draw conclusion from. could outliers. can’t argue around 0.00005%. might wrong protective immunity position isn’t enough evidence draw conclusion reinfecruon problem still justified. Unless show it’s don’t expect response. “long term” strategy Swedish model.

The ""long term"" strategy similarly used post-lockdown countries. unique Sweden. See NZ good example - currently far laxer measures too. countries include Finland, Norway, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore Vietnam. won’t shake foundations economy all. That’s something pro-lockdown people made try justify huge economic public health toll lockdowns. best approach Sweden’s. NZ Australia’s delaying inevitable. Another ridiculous post reddit. Imagine that! Yeah strong enough actually infect someone? 'live' but...... administration makes extra uncomfortable terms trusting right thing. trust rushed vaccine I'm damn sure trusting anything administration says. economy priority this, GDP tell whole story.

Neither debt. want best overview look projected EU Commission economic forecast released Tuesday predicts Finnish economy shrink 6.3 percent year grow 2.8 percent next joins Finland tail end forecast, growth next year estimated 3.1 per cent. year, Swedish economy expected shrink 5.3 also predicts Norway's economy shrink 5.5 percent year grow 3 percent next year.

Which parts show lockdown causes significantly economic They’re supposed “aggressive contact tracing” state US. I’ve close contact multiple people diagnosed COVID would’ve never known unless told themselves. take part COVID study university told shocked upset nobody health department ever contacted me.   

My phone also contact tracing thing built OS whenever try activate says Apple still waiting state’s health department allow it. Millions people carrying around devices make contact tracing goddamn easy POS health department sitting ass nothing. fucking country stg. UK lost 16,000 cases last month idiot using Excel 2003 truncated rows cases. 86% fucking crazy high, anyone studies corroborates this? sample size apparently fairly large (36k) number actual positives small (115). read 'lots accidental deaths' without even double take!   said country death rate like that. said death rate similar misreading New Zealand 1% probably traced almost cases bad symptoms? I’m asking cause issues vitamin too. 7 year weekly 50,000 daily 3,000 it’s 17. Also congrats getting levels up! It’s hard! nobody live actually affected Corona fuck matter? straight full blown panic attack went get tooth pulled years ago. told multiple times use gas, inject. warned would panic injected. injected, full started bawling panicking trying get passed out. 

They wake afterwards either. go get dad. woke instantly dad came back room. also reaction something, chill back good minute. Yeah day fun lmao billionaire talks, people listen.

okay seriously though. captain obvious doesn’t anything small biz belgians number translate 180k us cases. doubles 8 days. czech republic worse. BOOF South Korea returns lockdown pleads citizens adhere social distancing Korea’s government gradually reinforcing social distancing rules since 16 August, closing public schools, nightclubs churches and prohibiting gatherings 50 people one efforts far failed halt part latest escalation, private tuition centres – known “cram schools” – shuttered first time restaurants, bars food kiosks subject 9pm Poo Bear doesnt like them. good reason reason. Lol, rferl, source article, propaganda piece created USA specialized spreading propaganda Europe, claim China, Russia propaganda influential USA domestic sources yet countries best shape used sort lockdown and/or closed borders.

Unless offer explanation claim, trying derail conversation bad faith.

What countries good shape better New Zealand, Thailand china lockdowns all? Google covid activity risk charts gyms second highest category behind large venue indoor activities. remotely 8/9 Given Iran declares 30% deaths guess must near 1000 actuality.  airdrop antivaxxers make inhale microchips? knowledge sent supplies thr actual machinery manufacture it.

That 8 months ago. factories churning much PPE giving away. ... what?

You wearing mask whatever make smart tough. means care anyone else.  Whoever playing plague stop upgrading damn thing. admit defeat create something else. like deadly reaction memes contrails seem silly  woke today, feeling kinda bleh tickle throat cup tea tasted like hot water (it's vanilla spice put lot sugar cream it). Got notice confirmed positives apt building...

Do assume then? :/ Im risk group I'm concerned I'm worried go get test without accidentally infecting people. car live high rise two elevators. I'd say keep time. Food moths suck. think main problem higher lethality ease spreads. Uncontrolled coronavirus current strain infect well half population pretty quickly. Influenza that.

You lose capacity healthcare system deal issues covid health issues related it. said, another series lockdowns something definitely look forward cannot say limited knowledge warranted not, sure hell *seems* like are.  Trump ordered us manufacturers ship n95s china February, boost chinese production production death rate similar US. must misreading guys post. global pandemic stupidity respects national boundaries like virus. gives false sense security. single layer gaiter stops 10% 0.5 um particles cotton mask stops 40%, you’re talking someone front absolutely useless preventing infections. don’t need prove insecurity condescension. wear good mask. He's blackmailing anyone. He's ordering things contrary public health policy order extract personal political gain. Yeah one going bankrupt hospital trips great Probably ""would [sic] died anyways"" / ""harvesting effect"" sophism. mention “this administration” ? Essentially, that’s best argument lockdowns. seem effective short term. cases alway rise again, necessitating new lockdowns. lockdown system results yo-yo cycle lockdown again, draconian lockdown vaccine widely available. Hamburg/Germany, people gathered without distance street corners drank. bars shops stopped selling beer take house, remaining people keep distance. Curious think countries combined 150 million people UK, France, Italy 60 million each. total population 4 around 230 million.

It's better death/capita number, anyway like 4 countries beyond reproach either flip side, Canada say allows Canadians fly US despite border closure least Brazil, winner actually votes loser. I’m saying men aren’t incredible stress right now. I’m saying one study implies potentially women overall experiencing negative dreams, may may sign greater anxiety. may significant sociocultural trends explain this. doesn’t mean men aren’t facing family financial stressors. hypothesis greater proportion women facing types stressors, men aren’t facing similar (or even greater) stressors. percentage wise may smaller percentage women. may related this. Dreams may way women experience anxiety (although don’t know data supports that). particular stressors women face may likely dreamt about. I’m throwing potential interpretations data response dismissed findings hand men likely die covid. It’s competition. one saying men don’t suffer men easy pandemic. It’s potentially different stressors way anxiety may manifest may different. Two things always prevail general population: stupidity selfishness... supposed feel type way rn Same, though I'm 25 next year. career love life getting completely fucked point wonder they'll ever recover. get huge amount publicity you’re surprised people filling form trolling?

My children’s pediatrician kids back school full time. personal doctor doesn’t agree way we’ve locked everyone down. 7+ months in,my zip code 53 cases, zero deaths. Even schools reopened person 80% attendance 6 weeks. deadly contagious one elderly person entire zip code died 220 days almost 5 months reopen.

Sure. likely ploy? No. saw anti masker protest Toronto today. Even Canada safe idiots. almost certain children’s school isn’t reporting it. school isn’t requiring masks - students teachers. kids wear masks reported lots lots kids teachers home sick. day kid hallway, beet red, complaining cough fever didn’t go home (he wasn’t masked). Anyway, parents administration school afraid Covid testing don’t want end list government “track” them. So, pretty sure they’re outbreaks, testing, reporting. needs breaks may can’t stand like around kids much. Also taking consideration might different kind stress work home vs unemployed, plus kids 24/7. children’s ages self sufficiency skills take part parents beyond exhausted kids day. Well noticeable enough commentator wish luck pending test end interview. reminds Russians world war 2. Germans afraid fighting saw every Russian without glasses. reality Russians saw glasses sign weakness refused let soldiers wear them. Using aids isn’t sign weakness strength. Letting people know care loved ones far stronger choosing act everything fine. Reality harsh unforgiving. strongest thing face reality giving best fighting chance can. Related, there's movement stop describing cancer way well, reason. places blame responsibility belong. Comparing SARS-CoV-2 immunity common HCoVs little irresponsible.

Nah doubt it. influenza pandemic mask craze one wore masks afterwards. think problem death rates, least canada anybody died corona virus part corona virus death toll, dying cancer got positive corona test died 2 days later, died corona base statistics Thank answering! AMA. 🙂 

Given low wage, survive? job entail? Bruh sometimes go Piggly Wiggly confirm one wears masks. positive rates tests gone also generally considered mean missed cases. Know Australia it? government paid everyone AU$3,000 month 7 months stay home. They're *still* March 2021, although stepped payments depending circumstances. Cities emptier. people permanently working home. Businesses destroyed pandemic still closed. “Here’s another one downvote” says downvoting every single polite comment I’ve made thorough explanations. genuinely think mostly vaccinated population going wear masks social distance years 100% effective vaccine available? think world even afford that? 

Fauci MD, makes recommendations trying get best healthcare based effect fail consider economic social needs population. I’m American só Im liberty population vaccine uptake pretty high even 70% people took rushed vaccine H1N1 (that nowhere near societal impact COVID), head sand see vaccinated people comply orders anymore. isn’t medical science based anymore, social sciences human psychology. already massive parts US EU pandemic fatigue brought second wave. Tell next spring pandemic fatigue won’t even prevalent? Even Fauci knows social distancing won’t stand vaccinated population, incentive isn’t anymore COVID susceptibility much lower current level susceptibility. 

Im fortunate enough work home, sector unaffected current economic crisis. still heart concern aren’t fortunate, understand there’s acceptable level risk engaging normalcy again. acceptable level vaccine greater 50% efficacy primary outcome prevent COVID-19 severe enough hospitalize patient. Done responding, nice night buddy. case, global companies death business publicly traded? great couple years em.

We never cared begin here. definitely me. Want make predictions? really unlike uncivilised countries, European countries we're still paid self-isolate. wait test still limits amount ill people walking around, tend home self isolating. ones boasting great number medical scientists signing position paper. claiming, right following count signatories:

What pandemic? Lol lockdown quarantine contact trace time. Yes this. literally can’t re-shut anything Supreme Court ruled lot decisions “unconstitutional” point. love did. difference although big part increase diagnosed cases availability testing, PA cases nearly concentrated nursing homes way spring. Thankfully death rate positivity percentage decreased likely look increase soon since flu season officially started. Although people wear masks time public (SE PA), virtually one gives thought actually staying home wearing mask socializing friends houses, etc. really. lazy look politics.  Things general progressing conservative. Reagan would democrat now. entire point honest, would resulted panic buying masks made way healthcare workers. simple concept.

And ya, 3rd party voters tossed votes trash, indeed, resulted Trump elected. don’t know convince that, right cousin sisters mom cousin keeps coughing... I’m gonna get COVID even start fucking job one sided argument.. Maybe reason women facing family stress men often ones lose custody kids divorce. lots men (including friends) would love take care kids aren’t allowed to. Would sacrifice kids reduced childcare stress? Yes! absolutely agree little subset, husband falls category well. ever stop that...? seem like pandemic growing lmao yet.. I've read small group they're starting call xennials, ""micro generation"", born 1977 1983 (I'm one them). think fits. young really Gen X. old really millennial. Born world completely analog, shifting digital came age. That's consider be. one rule left. imagine snot nosed neck beard covering sneezing proud, people getting sneezed clap say"" patriot!"" Lmao last week people sub telling Sweden fine strategy proven work despite among worst world deaths per capita. [Statement – Rising COVID-19 fatigue pan-regional Time issue. goes by, people break. Yup! Millenial term coined around millenium talk things 'those kids' around turn millenium.

People 2000 lot say newborn babies. talking young people doing. generation kids school entering workforce around turn millenium. kept using term next 20 years keep referring teens people entering workforce. 

I'm 38, called millennial early 2000s. I'm called boomer people get called millennials today. idea events yes Wilson’s propaganda commission hugely responsible Americans hatred towards Germans  Wow. know that. TIL.

Edit: except 96 would 4 turn. beginning range base off? Bad moderation.
I'm always reporting low quality stuff subs idk anything done. 60% positivity rate, holy fuck Fun fact: COVID inected 0.5% global population, already killed million people!

And that's wearing mask going dumb social gatherings important.  Would say outdoor gatherings mixed mask usage, decent possibility transmit virus, therefore avoided, mandated against? _There war Ba-sing-se_ became adult millenials became adults around turn milenium. Roughly late 20's 40 years old. I'm guessing, pull head out. can't run full term virus three days. Plus, one two week incubation period. least two three weeks, last week. Even Dr. Fauci come complained timeline. buddy Trump messiah guys think is. all, proven liar, especially COVID. fan tbf coughed 3 times.  number people know genuinely believe election ridiculously high. really unable see foreshadowing going here? Super spreader event White house. Covid cases preparing spike again. Climate change threatening cataclysmic fires hurricanes. main character die. obvious. There's nothing else left writers do. account people long term issues. Tackling one existential problem like climate change would made pandemic much easier manage. recall refers Valium Keep posted! workplace? 

This pandemic brought best. Instead brought worst humanity. unbelievable thoughtless uncaring people be. self-centered ones. anyone could self-indulgent something I’ll never understand. think problem happened long this, mask problem happened instead saying “listen, people, masks work, need hospitals first responders. Please join forces start making masks friends,” said “masks don’t work.” Fauci others took long say work people already freaked out. Hopefully next pandemic better. I've never able figure trump's voter base generally masks trump trump masks voter base generally is. RemindMe! 30 days. God. far fallen. estimate Board airline representatives Australia. got elected reneged promise started commission spread anti German propaganda. beginning USA involved Americans anything bad say Germans weee diff us Americans. Towards end entered American visceral hatred Germans. plenty time resources stop pandemic sooner rather later.

What's evidence Wilsonian propaganda blame shift public opinion, rather stories German atrocities Belgium, sinking Lusitania, even (by 1917) Zimmerman Telegram?

Or misunderstanding you, saying events important Americans magnified Wilson administration? Yeah... that. I'm sorry, first posit opposite argument, you? Regardless, data right specific point, cannot definitely correlation/causation. still debatable. That's point. missing point. Sorry spell you. used call “scamdemic.” thought overblown media hoax. made fun people wearing masks. went way rabbit hole fell hard sword, want hate blame me, that’s fine. I’m plenty myself. 

... 

I told wouldn’t bad. “It’s flu. It’s basically flu.” didn’t horrible cough keep hearing about. breathing never got terrible. fever peaked like one day 100.5, nothing — barely worth mentioning. “All right. got this. See? nothing.” symptoms started get wild. sweating profusely. would wake pool sweat. tingling feeling body, radiating kind pain. remember old space heaters you’d plug in, red lines would light glow? felt like happening inside bones. burning inside out. buzzing. dizzy. couldn’t even turn head around look TV. felt like eyeballs fishbowl, bopping around. rubbed Icy Hot head. nonstop headaches sweating probably week — went away. got energy back. really good days. started working projects around house. thinking: “Okay. That’s it. Pretty bad, terrible. beat it. managed it. Nothing worth shutting entire world over.” one day walking stairs, sudden, couldn’t breathe. screamed fell flat face. blacked out. woke later ER, 10 doctors standing around circle. lying table going CT scan. doctors told virus attacked nervous system. They’d given medications stopped massive stroke. said minutes away.

I stayed hospital three days, trying get mind around it. guilt, embarrassment, shame. thought: “Okay. Maybe I’ve paid mistake.” kept getting worse.

Six infections turned nine. Nine went 14. spread one family member next, like person caught different strain. mother-in-law got never real symptoms. father 78, went get checked hospital, whatever reasons, seemed recover really fast. father-in-law nearly died living room ended hospital exact day. mother room right next trouble breathing. lying sides wall, fighting virus, neither ever knew one there. died weeks. day funeral, five family members tested positive. Death got corona I’m 26 decent health emt horrible could died. summation, death. fucking honest people. fucking trust gov health officials say can't fucking honest people. let's praise man helped spread anti-mask bullshit we've dealing with. I'ma assume also blame 3rd party voters trump president amount stupid spewing US bad EU good think lot people also getting tired cooped up, states least. see people social media going often. 

:/ Many billionaires became residents citizens years ago, that's point. 

In 2018

Why Silicon Valley billionaires prepping apocalypse New Zealand gave Peter Thiel citizenship spent 12 days 2017

Why Billionaires Moving New Fourth Reich isnt weather Italy fine ? mean even cold. Countries north Italy much worse it. Nope it’s one. Sweden’s economy poorly well. bad outcome around. U.S. insane asylum. Actually, wear masks law Paris compliance seems very, high area city. downfall restaurants packed w/ mask wearing, well lots private house parties. Teaching virtually different world person. It’s maddening yeah. best times way coping situation like this. kinds entertainment help pass time many different ways socializing people can’t meet person yet people can’t it. Sweden’s economy poorly others. strategy hasn’t helped guess problem people too, government measures . Im Argentina, one strictest lockdowns world formality. people give shit gathered together anyways wear masks nothing happening. 


In deeper sight , might well cultural issue too. think western culture differs Asian cultures terms stoicism community norms compliance. Asian countries used wear masks public variety reasons since , places masks wore before, troubles adopting them.  


They sense responsibility communities . give bloody F weaker ones, chose endanger party insignificant inconvenience wearing mask public Nope something affects almost every part lives negatively aren’t simply going accept “new normal”, fight back. quite follow. Could elaborate on
""I miss time healthcare experts vocal health societal engineering""
? Like compared what? 🙂 Yeah, super powerful skin alongside injecting disinfected clean lungs.

He repeating things understand try sound smart like coming ideas. really pathetic watch unfold. happens borders open again? page says :


Adults shed influenza virus 1 day symptoms appear approximately 5 7 days onset illness; thus, selective use masks (e.g., proximity known symptomatic person) may effectively limit transmission community. FUCKING REDDIT, ""front page internet"" Google took role you.  
You're HOST REPOSTS KARMA WHORES. Part reason US cannot deal pandemic people like believe typed instead actually looking China did. course you, media also blame.

Or let argue another direction. become abundantly clear enemies US around globe US uniquely vulnerable attacks biological agents. what's stopping attacking US future biological weapons US harden attacks, aside goodness hearts? Data plural information Spanish I’m sure think maybe participated earlier stage trials without control group.  New Zealand residents citizens (and children partners) permitted enter New Zealand. post opinion. Opinions aren’t facts. 

Downvoted judgmental deserves it. Well vaccine 100% effective Article doesn’t mention could placebo, don’t think would know not? Well since seems completely given finding origins virus we’re bound go entire thing within next 20 years. CDC page says exact opposite different conclusion anecdotal. tons studies conclude strong effect. studies covid, Ian Lipkin stated ""this week virology"" March already. meander around please wont change facts. Awesome... Yes trying repeat bunch stuff heard understand try sound smart like one coming ideas.

When called claimed joking serious bringing up.

Why think deserves credit lying joke taking back try cover ignorance? sounds stupid. say ""What data says?""

Yes should.

Yes. Amen hear ya. perspective week “lather, rinse, repeat”. Every week feels same. Good him. Glad see he's better US impossible get tested. US numbers probably underreported far France.  Look back, much world changed (without epidemics) last 5, 10 15 years only. top normal pressure change event impacts directly ways communications, vacations, family gatherings - direct threat sickness death - unreasonable think would effortlessly slip back 2019. 

It always ride change: denial, resistance, acceptance adaptation. 

Once complaining fiercely, congratulate yourself: longer denial ;) explaining somewhere else day, thought funny people tried instill values patience, discipline, seek instant gratification younger people pretty irresponsible right now. think look parameters easy find compared ones used, found tax registers. doubt research done, take time. Unless enough money pay rules apply you. thing is: payments forced parliy will. poses father it.

Quarantines lockdowns unpopular Brazil. place people die due violence poverty bunch. discourse life precious ""we even allow single death"" sounds unrealistic cynical there. country works informally, furlough kurzarbeit policies inviable informal workers #stayathome means hardship day already. fact point, Bolsonaro sounds honest, overly precious opposition alarmist liars touch reality.

I say person, every decent human being, fucking hates him. posture opposition, actually largely reminds strategy USA's democrats, handed PR victory even situation sounds like defeat.

I also add AMLO Mexico remained popular focusing corruption economy period, Fernandez, also center left quarantine enthusiastic, dire straits considered failure. much left X right thing.  investigations showed three asymptomatic cases associated Qingdao Chest Hospital, set independent areas treating imported cases COVID-19, commission said. Oh wait. Washington Post Jeff Bezos owns? man may benefit tiny bit this? OK! Check... Assuming referring US, would help? virus rampant US spread domestically. New Zealand took numerous precautions get point, addition banning travel small, isolated island nation, like social distancing, lockdowns, mask requirements, excellent contact tracing. US try want follow successful model. post full complainers. Complaining gets nowhere. Yes China literally round dissenters shoot heads. America cannot, not, means dissenters exercising ""freedoms"" harm nation's work towards mitigating COVID. doctor already admitted lying ""stay upbeat."" would anyone trust information? buy novel? Florida enters chat. Exactly. completely wasted gains made lockdown enforcing masks start opening. Plus, social distancing protocol complete farce nobody seems care. People cannot seem wrap brain around idée stay tf away other. root evil. actively root him.

Anything happens God all. Exactly hypocrisy special treatment ruling class gets access bullshit.

Do us would allowed check hospital day found tested positive?

Fuck no. would told leave come back death bed. do. 7 months allready. hope becomes new normal. care 99% chance I'll recover. 1% chance losing hearing, sense smell, fatigued years? thanks.

The ""99% recovery"" refers die. include experience symptoms. Dual. I. doesn’t exclude feeling empathy others. don’t get some. 😠 specifically large. there’s reason shoot “5 nines” reliability. 99.999% “It also surreal people world write asking knew would involve bat knew term ""social distancing."" didn’t crystal ball — access great expertise. So, people find movie accurate, give confidence public health experts right trying guide us."" 

Screenwriter Steven Burns interviewed 2011 film Contagion saw renewed interest current pandemic Germany liberal ICU admissions even patients old polymorbid. Also dont give easily. ICU patients poor prognosis weeks nothing unusual, whereas lot countries patients would get turfed normal wards ticket return. South Korea style containment control choose carry close normal, includes enforcing mask mandate, giving greater power health authorities, closing schools outbreak instead reporting strong contact tracing department. sociopaths people reported verified statistics? Speak yourself. sure. I'd shocked didn't. fact feels like needs keep keeping appearances probably make fatigue linger longer, rather taken full seven days bed rest got back campaigning sometime next week. can't, private jet flying billionaire? know. live across border, minutes east Grand Forks. ND residents really don’t give shit. It’s going disaster them. makes think people single generation? That’s basically dumb assumption. may want irrelevant. I’m going thought experiment Americans humans vanish/perish, would missed, would planet/the universe better off?

Thanks reinforcing hunch planet would better off. That's confirmed cases... illegal wear one? wear one yourself. ~~the main~~ reason difference Netherlands Germany. Guidelines get accepted IC differ well (not COVID specific related treatment methods, survival rate, half implications). current lockdowns purpose anyone explain.

Roflmao! typically ~~American~~ dim must person think lockdowns serve purpose. guess that's happens developed countries copy developing nations without realising purpose measures.

Lockdowns measure pause break uncontrolled community spreading, order buy time put contact tracing processes, implementing mass testing rapid turnarounds, fine tune isolation processes, prepare current healthcare infrastructure build treatment facilities, prepare dedicated quarantine centres, train healthcare workers disease prevention, secure PPE / build PPE production etc.

They not, according dumbfuckistanis here, sole purpose ""buying time vaccines"", eradicating virus thoughts prayers put reason. magic bullet stop covid (just like masks alone end all).

How October already people countries free media, freedom information, human rights, money, **still** unable realise this? Wtf media health officials doing? messaging still delivered? lockdowns used above? shit pulled state time office made extremely hard root this, gonna lie. 300+ million people, enough people let diseases circulate indefinitely 'invent' new ones. say also ban inter-state travel. Except men (in fact, working class men earn less women average Sweden enough statistically relevant) factors overlap perfectly poverty, Swedish context means primarily worse housing situation. could considering things like poor diet smoking well, also tend affect mostly poor people here.

It makes really sad none issues addressed considered. Improving health quality life population whole rather obsession ""non pharmaceutical interventions"". miss time healthcare experts vocal health societal engineering Ah open schools person learning say? think them, year two ""forever"". live instant gratification society things like personal sacrifice, matter minor seem like egregious affront sense ""freedom"" think owed. especially live US, part people seventy come demographic memory real sense sacrifice greater good, much less wait things. Maybe Trump stopped couple Chinese planes March. fourth reich-y you? work shoot hoops 🤷‍♂️. Although over-ear kind. safer/more restrictive around-the-head kind work with. really speak family Normandy; they're following mandates there's lot private socializing happening see graph (such online NY Times North Dakota Map Case Count) uptick steady since July sharper increase mid-August. There's nothing sudden this. Sad. want 100% population (at least one country) infected dangerous disease. sad person. That's terrible better numbers here.  live France. People wear masks supposed that's it. Still socializing privately maskless.  cousin epidemiologist, put way: COVID sits deadly sweet-spot, mild enough nearly everyone could ignore precautions fine individually, deadly enough society ignores precautions devastating. well thought wrong pls educate  Yes, Paris life usual part. One neighbors huge party last weekend. I've started carrying disinfecting wipes clean doors elevator every time leave building. He's woods yet... well go ask china implement trip wires. given China's health system still underdeveloped compared advanced economies, happened tripwires Europe US? asking something advanced Europe US currently have. Poor cats, die curiosity scientists sick sh*t. Yes, talking real cases. studies suggest developed countries could 10 unconfirmed cases every confirmed case. undeveloped countries ratio could lot higher access testing kits. Winter coming. probably means total number death middle pandemic necessary good metric strategic success. Death rate change death rate telling.  Interestingly, nurse also working ICU covid patients since least may. Lmao, seriously know science evidence proof? Ever heard Karl Popper? guess not. Nothing funnier uneducated people actually think know anything all. go buddy. Read learn. Maybe continue understand science actually downvoted this? 20MM wouldn't. long girlfriend Ivanka Gilead, company makes remdesivir, announced increased production speed antiviral better methods. faster times means greater supply available near future. fair wasnt total ban. People visiting relatives inside, instead people met outside. Amazing nobody cares much this. US crosses 8M, thread full jokes #1 much winning happening. India crosses 7M record time nobody bats eye. Germany there’s fines don’t (same way Dutch ppl suddenly follow rules go Germany). German tourists saw summer certainly don’t care all. agree lot morons running around conspiration theories blocking thoughts. 

Regarding lockdowns however, lot proof. scientific evidence strategy works, since lot countries practiced would like see positive effects lockdowns. So, you?

Not really. France hard lockdown spring, 35% ICU patients treated covid Paris “second wave”. Sweden lockdown period even though cases increasing now, 5% ICU-beds occupied covid patients. Taiwan lockdown practically free covid. 

So, still evidence lockdowns effective, either scientifically empirically. Almost lost job refuse serve someone tried telling masks work corona deaths barely flu. refuse sit polite kind insanity. Germay's number going pretty significantly right now. No, science says needed. LOL. Yea like gonna save haha students partied Vaasa currently outbreak, said originally meant party smaller groups, later evening already much fun resist meeting new people go bar bar...

But yeah, them. Pretty much none. lockdown, literally thousands people currently enjoying life would 6ft underground. people call failure beyond me. Thousands people get alive. betterment what? me, goal maxmize years saved, instead number lives saved. means saving young people suiciding, getting children jabbed die infectious disease, resume elective surgery, etc much valuable saving elderly, especially right median age death literally higher life expectancy.

Before call idea unethical something, criticizing italians earlier otherwise practising double-standard, exactly triage patients nobody says anything. i.e 80 years old 25 years old need ventilator one, young get prognosis elderly (almost guranteed) grave. 

It's able go bar restaurants, people know already spend 1 year 3 year Uni entirely online, isolation spend least another half year remote study. what? virus little chance killing them? Why? literally endorsed Brazil’s previous military dictatorship. He’s fascist trump saint comparison 1 10,000... Patients asthma become infected new coronavirus appear higher risk hospitalization need mechanical breathing assistance compared Covid-19 patients without asthma, updates coronavirus. happens next rest world pertinent question? seeing 2nd wave currently rising Europe US? chaos northern winter going bring? NZ sit one can. data Chinese cases comes China directly, third parties, making easy change data, fact changed counting methods multiple times revised death toll doesn’t give high hopes. fact silenced whistleblowers lied COVID beginning, human human transmission, severity, etc, doesn’t give high hopes New normal. come! fuck you, moron. [Comparing automobile deaths COVID deaths daily basis, right. even lot work schooling done pretty much online now, too. liking outcome democratic election mean it’s fascism. fascism would able vote, silly! fascist? fact you, Brazilians sit cry fascism day proof isn’t fascist. drugs? Sure know. it’s simply true. Well, simple. course, certain regions world would benefit less babies, countries already seeing problems population ageing. Im one saying it. quoting Antoine Flahault, director the Institute Global Health, Geneva. Haha it’s like people can’t deal Sweden failing dealing Covid.

Sweden already sparse population huggy sociable France Italy, Sweden’s Covid response absolutely pathetic consider advantages have.

And yet people still seem think Sweden’s ridiculous approach somehow still relevant controlling Covid today. outbreaks NRW Bayern. 
There reports turkey mass weddings +350 attendees super spreading events. liking outcome democratic election mean it’s fascism. fascism would able vote, silly! also twice number people hospital NL less cases, ICU admission criteria irrelevant really.

Same ratio hospitalised ICU. different ratio cases hospitalised. 

Clearly nothing ICU admission criteria. Interesting, Thanks insight, Mike Agree absurd.

Sweden unique country highest taxes world large amount trust people people government. fact Sweden might able get without police locking people doesnt mean rightwing capitalist country like example US without restrictions. 

Sweden probably left country world probably left response pandemic (left distribution wealth) Yet somehow missed right (and left extent). Oh get it, maybe effective sort Sword Damocles. actually round dissenters shoot face like we're longer helps disease prevention? Oh god... that's even longer first lockdown... we're gonna need 6+ months Wuhan lockdown, that's impossible (and probably beyond Macron anyway). we're isolated island like Australia share aren’t even sure? given placebo non-story really provide misinformation. get that? know talking globally here? 37mil 7bil around 0.5%.

EDIT: maybe talking confirmed vs real cases. right. probably lot more. can't be, Germany recording less cases Netherlands hospital, ICU. also reason always recommended majority population vaccinated? there's large herd immunity even though vaccine 100% foolproof, diseases still harder time jump people people? Yeah, explanation lack perspective. country, 10'000 considered city. let claim perfect physical specimen actually young. Yes. **All viruses this.** That's meant saying people took seriously spring anymore. spring masks recommended almost one used them. recommended still officials always remember say know help (which bullshit). know live Helsinki region mask usage public transport increased quite much summer. everytime go shop think well ""strong recommendation"" works. woman Facebook anti vaccine anti mask. it’s government taking away rights. Doesn’t matter much science throw her. Maybe, also much higher number hospital compared cases countries. UK instance getting around 15 - 20k cases around 3000 hospital. nothing know Czechia. Everyone wears mask since month ago, still 2nd highest amount new cases world. Masks work extent. even include link.

I pretty sure PEBKAC issue. See clears things you. 96 year old German great grandfather would like fucking Word moron  West needs get it’s ego check right things already established numerous non-European non-American countries. many people study?

Out ten, oh fuck. ten thousand, cares? Err mean Korean model. one world following Sweden’s example. Yep. would LOVE go see family Europe anti-maskers people right thing getting worse worse again

ETA: case it’s clear didn’t state it, obviously care people’s lives health whether go Europe - miss family Finally, US number one cases per million anymore. 5 percent there. rest get infected, 3 4 million dead US. know acquired citizenship / residency private Jet getting would big deal. might quarantine etc. 

Have read citizenship buying going Caribbean? wealthy snapping real estate?

**The Island Brokers Overwhelmed**

**The wealthy want escape pandemic private, isolated paradise. people sell islands explain: It’s Yesterday outbreak nursing home Osnabrück. 30 something infected. Hopefully turns alright. 
But yes deaths still quite low compared daily infections long time doctors supported smoking cigarettes taking cocaine medical therapies. fact change opinion? everyone gets it, it'll good actually. course, time, everyone day. learn live it, virus disappear. China really care west believe not. west wanna get rid virus, better believe it.  Another jerk zero compassion. ever worked retail? idea you’re talking about. It’s typo autocorrect. 🤦🏻‍♀️ every bus train someone enforces mask rule. quite high fines 50-150€ don’t wear correctly little enforcing rule. Also lockdown spring, distance rules much stricter compared now. Children partners permitted enter. Thousands partners seperated since start pandemic.  sub original covid subs switch mods pretty crazy stuff go around beginning year, back still nCov-2019. Reddit together beginning much now. employer pay less minimum? Isn’t law? overall public enough people aware going still?

Whats general mood like? I’ve noticed too, flip particularly noticeable last weeks. even seen fair amount Fauci hate recently absolutely unheard couple months ago (aside occasional critique early mask recommendations). Number deaths metric measure success 

Take minute reflect. interesting country whose government actually filmed sending secret police unmarked vehicles nab protestors street pandemic seem success disease control thesis predicts. this? Putting bullets dissenters driving seem work us either.

Very strange silencing scientists, limiting testing, faking data according effective strategies China turn ineffective implement home. It’s joke people understandably going difficult times? Wow. I’m glad don’t apathetic point view. Maybe understanding compassion things wouldn’t fucked are. 

I work healthcare. feel stressed they’re going through. also feel grateful job. Unlike I’m looking people. dare you. Ohh no, small country (Latvia), comment sections consist basically deniers. go Public transport masks mandatory, vast majority wearing wearing correctly. observation tho biggest deniers Generation X baby boomers millennials hold education (mostly construction workers young facebookmoms). 
I sorry stereotyping, that's observation. anti maskers Spanish flu, too. Although probably wide spread coordinated internet age. Arw fucking obtuse purpose? Netherlands brink lockdown, expected stricter measures taken spring. Except schools... remain open matter what. Huh?? idea. It’s pretty common Germany think things turn better without reason. think better aspects example US, Italy France. health system indeed one best world still assume icus remain empty like situation now? 
Arrogant idiots well, happening. look Sweden dude can’t even convince boss definitely is. Yes China literally round dissenters shoot heads.

They *didn't* though, relevant?   3 serious illness events upon reinfection.

You’re right. long lasting protective immunity, expect serious illness occur upon re-exposure (or increased symptoms occurred 50% secondary exposure cases known outcomes).

That’s incorrect. definitely would immune system isn’t perfect. People die common cold despite people typically protective immunity. Seems like trying make reality rather acknowledge what's actually going patients. so-called ""protective immunity"" 50% reinfections (with known outcomes) result severe symptoms first exposure?

Well first .00005% cases really nothing draw conclusions from. number alone suggests *is* sterilizing immunity lasts least long virus around. Secondly 50% worse symptoms means protective immunity 50% mean? Thirdly isn’t 50%, it’s 36%. 8 22. 

Same symptoms: 11 (50%) (72% symptoms)
Worse symptoms: 8 (36%)
Less symptoms: 3 (13%)

You’re one drawing conclusions nothing. history coronaviruses one essentially permanent protective immunity. evidence contradict reason assume different. won’t open world without virus, there’s talks bubbles places level covid control keeping borders shut now, potentially opening still requiring isolation 14 days government managed hotels Hopefully, narrative „ health System isn’t good ours, problem.”

Typical German Überheblichkeit - Economic damage Sweden similar. Even domestic spending.

- Sweden lockdown nursing homes 6 months. Cruel. Germany 6 weeks.

- Sweden still bans events 50 people. Germany football matches 8.000 fans game since. Also Sweden applies political demonstrations - bit undemocratic.

Where exactly Sweden's advantage? Humans lead short, boring, insignificant lives, make stories feel like they're part something bigger. want blame world's problems single enemy fight, instead complex network interrelated forces beyond anyone's control. - Pearl, Steven Universe time though, easier us people West. lockdown practically 6 weeks, faced lockdown fatigue many places faced elsewhere. 

I'll absolutely applaud Chinese people, government pretty worthy applause making lockdown easy people simple follow, least difficulty first month. 2020 actually 庚子年, way calculating years happen every 60 years. 庚子年 considered years great upheaval times change.

1840 - [First Opium - [Eight-Nation - [Three Years Natural Paywalled. someone please paste article here? president? think part seasonality part unfeasibility prolonged social distancing mitigation measure. It’s real easy talk “idiots” ignoring rules, people ignoring rules West problem rules people. wasn’t reasonable expect people socially distance 18 months. got good months public fatigue sets in. Legend doctor made statement President happy went give doctor hug ran away. virus truly preys human short-sightedness.  one bought idiots conversation. Yeah work Hong Kong, many like trust mainland, understand sentiment. live across border Hong Kong despite think city live handled many times better hk.

There reason border 2 cities still closed hk careful, way around. positivity rate says all. Argentina's testing joke. number cases reporting limited many tests run. one knows many new cases are, whether curve even reached peak. certainty Argentina losing \~400 people Covid every day, population 45 million. probably know much anyone state find inexpensive housing solid Internet

Don't keep secret man! shouldn't. None foregone conclusion started. world's ineptitude containment led current predicament, inevitability.  Think it’s crazy built dogma Americans say even it’s available them. people allowed pack stadium max guarantee will. exactly anarchy never work.  Oh, so, suggesting was, LOOKED TO? Eh? Good, looked light therapy touted Trump also still development. According clinical trials website, tested five COVID-19 patients ventilators see lessen viral load disease severity.

I bet theories proposed US presidents get like 2 test subjects. lab Helix, state, Friday report done 64,582 tests new lab. already procedure integrate data, I'm understanding automatically checked duplicates. state uses SAS reporting easy code check duplicates using I'm buying it. 

So 400,000 records one lab break reporting system, hope news follows Helix get explanation. 0.6% healthcare: oxygen, antibiotics, steroids, vent ect 

things even dream 1918 Gatherings sorts discouraged avoided. said, believe banning gatherings mandated.

Gathering outside masks little doubt far safer option gathering without masks. Sure, ""theory"" sure hell one I'd bet against. Oh EVERY single American come flu, also many people got twice. Wow. i'm shocked heard burned medical professional something bad tinfoil hat idiot point. somebody smarter tell me; sunlight already contain wavelength that's supposed kill it? so, it? God fucking stupid. note caution: form light therapy proven work COVID-19. **Some forms UV light harmful trigger sunburns eventually cause melanoma.**  

Oops. u know u get multiple flu year? .08 IFR flu last season. IFR = deaths / infections x 100. I'm everything data here. Deaths 18/19 season 34k, infections estimated 38million. op, Canada city 5000 people. ""New Zealand offers residence permits rich investors—the hacker Kim Dotcom, who’s facing extradition United States, bought way investing millions dollars—and grants citizenship special circumstances people don’t meet five-year residence requirements.""

Qingdao Municipal Health Commission reports 11/10/2020, three asymptomatic carriers found city Qingdao, two discovered routine PCR test patients hospital, one discovered via contract tracing original two. initial epidemiological investigation believe three asymptomatic carriers related city's chest hospital stand alone section responible treating COVID-19 patients. Exact chain transmission still investigation.

Mr Han, male, 58 years old. Resides Shibei District Luoyang Road Sub-district Office, 7 Wuyang Road. 09/09 Mr Han hospitalised chest hospital tuberculosis treatment. Mr Han discharged 04/10/2020.

As reminder citizens: intensify personal protection. Wear mask according scientific guidelines, wash hands often, maintain good ventilation, maintain social distance cooperate relevant health monitoring authorities. experience symptoms like fever take much preventive measure possible. Avoid public transport seek medical attention nearest fever clinic soon possible.

Heck, even want traveling domestically right now. Thanks advice though, take care. holiday weekend. fear numbers week now. would gladly trade places citizenships could.

-Canadian residents citizens buy homes New Zealand lol - talk soon! :) Wish could go! enforce it? Shoot streets? Fines work, especially since people charged posh upper middle class people Healthcare administration actually advocating reducing emergency capacity many places. Excess hospital capacity increases cost healthcare actually needed sure uncensored trustworthy data. .01% 1 10,000. math (or apparently not) 40,000 deaths x 10,000 = 400 million mean wear one ten hours day work. They're bad.  mean around 40 million infections. Oh good. Things getting way normal. deflect. ones publicizing large number signatories pedigrees. ones putting discussion scope. claim something fact, boast make press releases, cry people take hard look claims.

It's also serious proposal. Allowing encouraging young people become infected needs solution keep infection spreading older family members. nothing say all, unless count policy position: 

**Measures, including approaches multi-generational households, implemented, well within scope capability public health professionals** 

If answers, present them. Public health professionals obviously found answer yet.

But I'll tell present one. one. advertising campaign something exist. talking deaths per million.  One country millions ingections obviously deaths.. Oh yeah, you’ve never ever heard surgery? Never heard stent? Never heard thing “oscopy” end it? use things “inside body” time. Trump *is doctor* said “we look that” doctors told UV light kills it. months ago. Months. Fuck you. We’ve always war east Asia  one? one wrong tried find statistics support ever moving point?

It’s cool, bro, get you’re triggered. 

Best luck.

Scream void bs...blocked.

I don’t time inclination talk people like you.

Sucks wrong, get it. basically idiot don't, overwhelming evidence support zero evidence contradict it. Yeah western countries dont want like china. would rather cell phone app tracked me. Good. you’re type demographic staying home non stop. able bodied people work, maintain economy, enjoy lives, sit ass provide you. week, hairdresser posted tired nonsense “no one know died.” 

Btw, need new hairdresser... feel pain, guy. Born-again Christian sister law told evolution hoax telling masks don’t work ALL, knows Dr.Fauci. high school drop dead beat baby daddy....knows more....than DOCTOR. FAUCI. surrounded people really think way. would 2020 therapy ends successful lol  Yeah this. brain must stuck August thought well heard per capita numbers week. North Dakota Smart /s part dumb “inside body”. So, fuck still. mom’s deaf one ear since kid mumps. Stuff like used happen time viral infections, we’ve forgotten society we’ve able keep control last 50 years thanks vaccines.

I’d say hope wake call anti-vaxxers know won’t saw video Jewish guy IG Feed...he neighborhood Brooklyn filming someone getting live shots neighborhood saying ""he filming people masks ratings news."" Meanwhile, ton people walking around video masks on. hospitalizations 7% 100,000,000 infected. That's 7,000,000 going need ICU beds. less 100,000 US. Even converted hospital beds US ICU beds still enough beds go around. People would die. completely ignoring lack trained health care workers equipment would render hospital beds otherwise useless turn beds. 

This means lack medical care double triple, perhaps exponentially increase death rate people die lack medical care. death rate inches 0.013% whatever theoretical lower limit IFR believe true, closer 7% would disaster death rate would include younger people would otherwise survived. believe 7% death rate would bad nothing discuss licensed work mentally handicapped criminally insane

That's everyone going nuts earlier year ventilators field hospitals, worried going catch virus fast enough spread quickly overwhelm health care system. Keep mind week two COVID literally leading cause death US. currently hovering around number 3. Maybe heard flattening curve? COVID 101, known back February March.

So please enlighten us exactly think 7% high? year rat Chinese zodiac. things keep like expect lot rat looking lucky charms. Winter coming it’s going worse initial peaks. know! got AP alert thought glitch info. Nothing would better pain suffering. perfect conditions fascism. flashlight 👌👈🏻 That's one way drain Swamp...

Basically entering conspiracy theorist territory; ""the medical professionals lying!"" 



People really disgusting whole situation. Wishing die calling ugly swollen jis videos. dude sick virus y'all keep throwing face. Remember that. can't claim moral high ground ""200 000 dead"" wish deaths top people dislike, hate justify shit. That's hypocrisy straight simple. Either Covid Covid. child. USA: Hold beer. rich buying property years, intuition real good. Yea sucks, contradict I've said fashion?

Why people *naysaying* COVID19, treating like serious, argumentative people do? mad people wear masks take seriously, pissed government failing badly could protect support you---you know, thing *have* governments for? thought dragon rising before. Coronavirus might one best things ever happened China since Nixon opened economy. Feel free lick ass Lol - thought might like one ;)   well simple statistical argument. commonly acknowledged virus originated within 1 sq km Wuhan chinese level 4 virology lab. lab china known working corona virus. 500 million sq km earth new virus could originated in. Seems likely related way work undertaken lab doctors carte blanche experiment patients. further, information distributed imperfectly hospitals countries, places trying one thing another place trying another thing communication ""we believe seeing success.""

What’s normal coronaviruses long term protective immunity you’re really correct here. Sterilizing immunity what’s likey short term. airborne droplets 

Those aren’t mutually exclusive. People use airborne boogie man. It’s airborne measures recommended don’t work. That’s important spreads anyone public. naturally acquired herd immunity work

The evidence says otherwise history coronaviruses. Reinfection mild. become cold. sub ridiculous, originally people interested covid eventually turned people trying downplay it.

And it’s full people eager panic using half baked information form worse case conclusions. I’m curious know Alaska, it’s reported hit 232 new cases today, “new record.” However, July 26th apparently 234 cases...

Unless mean killing 10% population every 8 months so. restaurants area packed parking lots Friday night. went outdoor wedding ceremony masks left 100+ maskless people went inside reception. mom lost hearing one ear March never gotten back. doctor said likely “a virus”. keep trying get get antibody test won’t even consider it. 5G? bill gates? micro chips? It’s flu BTW live small town northeast. usually jog beach jog boardwalk beach. October arent many people.

I bring mask case put sometimes 99% time keep plenty distance us, isnt big city, town thousand people total. maybe pass dozen people five miles like said, xan easily keep distance.

I also look away passing try inhale exhale second pass.

Also since im water always windy.

Pretty sure sweaty face destroys mask anyway seems crowded Ill put courtesy. Running mask sucks doable.

I didnt go anywhere beach summer though.

So yeah, doctors confirming Ive bern following. Masks outside cant socially distance. Something over, US. pandemic still pandemic. See 
Source: [John’s Hopkins hospital treating imported cases new arrivals, seems probably breakdown protocol somewhere. surprise end finding staff members infected. cuckdown even possible? crowd even QUARTER size, would still give drive home call day live China. wearing masks compulsory anymore yet people still wear them. people still disinfect hands entering building. People considerate around them. applaud China way PEOPLE handling situation. together. stand alone die alone.
edit:spelling still got better treating it, like instance turning patients side helped lot recovery rates It’s sleep bro! didn’t make wear shitty mask? Germany half measure. Total lockdown destroy life system. think large uptick everywhere weather changing. fall Italy, France, etc? virus first emerged escaped China, people naturally think China poor job containing it. reality exactly opposite: China acted extremely quickly stop virus, among best public health responses emergent disease world ever seen.

People understand *extremely quickly* China locked down. Hubei Province locked down, ten deaths day. China locked 20 provinces days later. lockdowns dramatically stringent lockdowns US.

The lockdowns US start Mar 18, SF Bay Area counties shutdown, complete April. point, 1,000 deaths/day US.

The US locked 100x many deaths occurring population 1/5th large China. per capita basis, 500x many daily deaths US China locked down.

And original sin. Despite knowledge happening China, United States complete single test Covid anyone without travel history China *February 27th*, Seattle Flu Study broke Federal law, ignored FDA CDC, began conducting testing.

The virus spread unchecked US least Jan 15 mid-March without appreciable testing, even understanding happening.

At time, thought outbreak beginning, reality period peak outbreak. peak daily deaths US recorded April 21st, given 18 day lag symptom onset death, safe say peak outbreak right around April 3rd.

This China able control outbreak. implemented draconian lockdowns extremely early, trained hundreds thousands contact tracers, stopped disease tracks. impossible, acted comparatively quickly. healthcare provider infuriates me. don’t want thanks. want speak truth situation shut fuck up. B52 still use. that? genuinely care strange case. patient zero cluster? cluster genomically linked seafood plant another introduction city? cases found due mass testing drive would detected otherwise?  last 9 months flat circle  it’s dumb article 

There nearly enough data schools come conclusion

Schools closed world March August. 

Now schools reopened 4-6 weeks data places. Let’s see stand February I’ll feel comfortable agreeing conclusion. Considering world seeing rise Covid outbreaks past week, think need little data

School students don’t drive influenza outbreaks September either. shit drivers December. Sucked, everything hurt, lot soarness, cough really bad, felt like sand paper throat, dizzy weak fuck. Super nauseous. Super tired unable get good sleep pain sickness, everything smelled like bleach nothing
Everything tasted like absolute bland shit metal, soda tasted like chemicals. Missed two weeks work got hit w bill 300$ appointment, two weeks later appendix failed ended back ER emergency surgery



The docs said it’s probably correlated appendix failing, never issue w organs like ever, maybe corona make fail. Maybe didn’t. read articles bodies response corona shutting organs due shock sends body ...go doom gloomers like this. They'll find way argue it. ready....... mean, still happen, feel like 45 going win. done things differently, would have, since didn't, seem like it. feel blowback response pandemic growing last couple weeks. times crisis, good choices made, people tend stand leaders, imagine popularity grew. American's paid stay home something like that, 45 facing he's facing right now. pheasants near home might giving disinformation? evidence covid caused fear mongering? crazy Illinois put mandatory 14 day quarantine policy traveling WI coming back Illinois.

They act like WAY better controlling WI. Yes, know WI serious issues right outbreak, Illinois needs look mirror realize City Chicago immune mask mandate. Florida neither major drop cases hospitalization. It’s even bad flu ‘The country seen roughly 590 deaths per million—on par 591 per million United States 600 Italy, many times 50 per million Norway, 108 Denmark, 113 Germany.’

Spoiler - didn’t pay off. Plenty anti-establishment news agencies thriving around

Both statements wrong. seen mainstream media India (if India, guess) completely pro-government tries hide every fault attacking opposition, labelling everyone questions anti-national.

The anti-establishment news agencies far fewer, less resources (so thriving) government tries every day harass them. Seriously? H1N1 originated? Everyone expected ineptitude though. Especially US, India Brazil simply politicians. 

I incredibly surprised strict India’s initial lockdowns were, went back course giving that. Okay, curious. fucking doctors hospitals actually giving COVID patients drug ? bullshit 10 months ?

I havent heard shit new treatments anyone receiving we’re already 10
months shit ? like actual
fuck ..? would rather blood pressure spike, I'm pretty good. 
I'm true crime. know we're failures species, still see good world I'll die. hope follow too. weird. Several people neighborhood facebook page said halloween parties. wife tested positive wednesday(results came today). got tested today Im negitive. symptoms. Shes getting retested tomorrow return work shes negative. gets paid dont off. test every week work. mean sure, US pumping 50K+ cases day months France low thousands since initial spike Good point takes since first symptoms recover die. bout full New Zealand Results

On average, number excess cases per 100,000 residents states reopening without masks ten times number states reopening masks 8 weeks (643.1 cases; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 406.9, 879.2 62.9 cases; CI = 12.6, 113.1, respectively). Excess cases 6 weeks could reduced 90% 576,371 63,062 excess deaths reduced 80% 22,851 4858 states implemented mask mandates prior reopening. 50,000 excess deaths prevented within 6 weeks 13 states implemented mask mandates prior reopening.

Conclusions

Additional mitigation measures mask use counteract potential growth COVID-19 cases deaths due reopening businesses. study contributes growing evidence mask usage essential mitigating community transmission COVID-19. States delay reopening mask mandates fully implemented, enforcement local businesses critical preventing potential future closures. feel that. get car first thing rip off.  moved ND Christmas 89' I'm from, people consider GF Fargo real ND.

I think think cities Minnesota overspill since close border interstate.

It's miserable place, people weird clique individuals. prairie life poisoned ability use logic reasoning. tolerable short stints, place could use thorough ""cleansing"".

Hopefully, help reduce winter's potential impact. rough, can't bury heads sand like lot us last time.

You’ll find chick online. get tested together start banging!! Officials asked people sign certain date wanted return get free quarantine. natural cost sustainable. seeing right happening Europe, everybody (a less) terrible job. 
I think stop separating nation's always compare us other. 
Maybe nz china not,but overall response covid point view bad.
in many ways. don’t think schools problem there’s high prevalence disease local population. 

Once kids bring from
home schools, seems inevitable spread like wildfire among other

Schools fuel spark outbreak

Also, Tennessee currently seeing highest 7 day average new cases since August, may soon say schools didn’t cause increase cases. Remember, kids usually mild symptoms. kid sniffles isn’t getting Covid test... Philippines crying necessarily. China better pandemic control efficient competent leadership social infrastructure. Vaccine development China's forte. would still put bet US/UK/Germany overall better vaccines.  wait, think president flown hospital dire emergency he’s president almost always goes helicopter? Well...they ain’t. Stimulus pared bones, still GOP Senators saying it’s much. likelihood anything passing 11/3 basically non-existent. 45 loses, won’t care stimulus, want pout. yeah man, too. whine even close same. ...and illustrated pandemic, additional capacity handle surge emergency medical needs isn’t necessarily helpful bottom line even end filling extra beds. want run profit system healthcare, inevitable result shit hits fan. tough situation noted ample notice given would start restrict number flights date. Anyone signed date offered way come back.

There's way please everyone think reasonable. kidding right? wore 2 hours today, on, switching stores project we're face felt like swamp after. that, there's many coverings people use. even pretending know I'm wearing? high. That's way is. 

Why assume 100,000,000 (one hundred million people) going infected TIME USA? That's insanity. 

The USA population 320 million people, REALLY think one third going catch COVID time? That's possible. 

Historically, USA 7 million COVID cases spread March October, that's almost 1,000,000 (one million) cases per month. REALLY think 100,000,000 million cases (that is, x100) happening simultaneously possibility?

Please wake get informed, licensed work mentally handicapped criminally insane. things go like lock down. Also hospitality industry overrated. people getting tired globalist leftism. give public advice mask wearing. Especially officials said early ""the public wear masks work worn correctly"". take Chinese approach destroy nearby coral reefs use land fill. part TN, schools open two months appears crazy increase. classes half full wearing masks. genuinely surprised, honestly. course, posting info it, could shit show. link?

The numbers I'm seeing around 5000 deaths/day 300,000 cases/day last week. numbers closer 1.6%.

Are suggesting true number cases closer 3.5 million per day? back up? said agree way ran website opened criticism. I’m deflecting anything I’m always conversation. 

I also agree properly explain plan multi generational households. However varies wildly. kids therefore we’re technically multigenerational. low risk children. 

However grandparents lived would different story. would figure something else out. also doesn’t apply vast majority American households. don’t typically homes 3 4 generations like would see commonly somewhere like India. honestly don’t know would situation. stay away vulnerable people families now. lived I’d either live different lifestyle find separate home. 

Again though, believe necessarily need lockdown entire populations protect vulnerable. 

I truly appreciate conversation resorting typical insults animosity unfortunately become common around here.

You mentioned adverting campaign. what? motive? They’re making money far tell. don’t think go Oxford study epidemiology kill people. western countries chose learn China, glorify China's pandemic response. Treatment? treatment? truth don’t treatment doctors give supportive procedures like supplementary oxygen ultimately comes immune system.


Don’t tell dexamethasone, used treat SARS-CoV-1 too, hardly news get era media seems make big deal somehow.

Lockdown certain places doesn’t work.

Here question lockdown advocates vaccine readily available general public late 2021, stay lockdown then? must realize trump isn’t person declare lockdown think infringing freedoms. dont get it.  also dont get I'm getting downvoted saying I'm seeing  Lancet EVIL COMMUNIST people say police take military gear stop living fear. long traces virus detectable test?

I'm seeing everyone talking whether Trump exposed virus Biden, saying he's ""out woods"" 14 day incubation period up.

Surely fact he's tested negative means he's clear? takes dozen days detect virus symtoms show, tests effective all? Mostly everyone time get tested they're suspicious. Saying like reminding someone drink water 663 cases reported Idaho yesterday. neighbours tried *suppress* virus *mitigating* spread. Two different strategies two different timelines. 

I know already wants call winner, least see second wave first? I’ve wanted many times, I’m honestly worried safety comes calling people public. Part wants like “wear mask right, don’t know around you. Like me, person works Covid patients every day.” There's phrase that... Yea know. think Korea also total 260 deaths ridiculously low number, despite 50 million densely populated country. highly doubt significant amount spread occurring masked gatherings.

It's restaurants, bars, house parties gatherings masks coming off. Gladly reapprove it. Thanks providing sources. making claim common knowledge. However, idea ADE occur coronavirus vaccine developed entirely different ways SARS vaccine. Belgium much strict countries mirror cases/ day first seconf wave THEYRE SELLING CHOCOLATES statewide mask mandate working wonders Yeah think normal back end 2021 you’re wrong probably back 8-9 months earlier Spanish flu killed 50 million, wasn’t really “new normal” areas afterwards despite 1%-6% world’s population dying. Right, what’s solution people lost livelihood streets ? eat ? afford medicines pandemic ? Real smooth brain thinking Alrite, gonna troll I'm gonna bother helping you. going fairly well Sweden IMO Holy cow... finally know worse flu? think knew surpassed last years flu deaths no?  I’m sorry honest contribution won’t seen, Dr. Fakeman  dont lock belgium exceed hospitalisation march. Ok. We’re arguing semantics

The point wearing masks probably main reason sweden fared much worse neighbors Whenever friend starts preaching anti-lockdown mute 24 hours. Probably needs heart scan too.  still don’t know full effects virus. may kill us, ample reports published various side effects people get it. Lung damage, neurological deficiencies. sacrifice making also sake well. Idk can’t really afford healthcare treatment case get it’s bad. parents also 2-4 years shy boomers would like die. You’re upset wrong people, it’s boomers whole, rich boomers. Well... friggin chopper fly to...
Not doctor....
Not hospital room...

But friggin hospital every medical specialist, country probably whole world, every medical treatment (no matter cost) disposal...

Then might get impression covid-19 similar flu. town 2 infections 14 days. course lot People resist. cant go pub, see videos brussels sociale distancing all. Vlaams Belang scores lot points footage. Wait, USA didn’t lockdown? I’m confused now. wondering countries similar deaths per million completely different narratives pushed. Scoreboard: COVID 45 vs Dumb-Fucking-UF-and-everyone-attending-it 0 complaining COVID compared flu, compare COVID common cold coronaviruses. related SARS 1 common cold coronaviruses.

Denmark tested *more* South Korea per capita scale. next excess deaths March/April - basically weathered first wave smoothly South Korea did. Germany fare much worse things considered.

Some expected, suppose, seem especially bungled FL variety massive issues needed patched up... STILL correctly reflected numbers months later. I'm pretty sure people claiming mask dangerous people claiming masks silver bullet. think they're silver bullet line defense besides washing hands distance. Also, fact France even distinct second wave proves point lockdowns working, versus America’s perpetual first wave.

Does matter end result gonna same? way France going, going end exact situation US in, economic suppression *costs lives*. whole purpose lockdowns avoid healthcare system overwhelmed, United States successful far. curve Bergamo, small uptick last two days curve almost flat since end lockdown.

Furthermore, assist impoverished much proponents insist does.

Would rather believe rubbish think-tank nonsense, government health experts like Dr. Fauci? Excess mortality suggests also hiding another 10,000 deaths get reinfected

The rewarding even though clients cant talk I've learned love appreciate shown words. Getting wordless thank yous' love yous' make worth end.


The hardest isnt anything clients cause. work 14 hours weekends 10 hours weekdays (I work 6 days week). top make less local mcdonald's. stay said before. Thank questions! thought issue study, can't find post it. Hopefully someone respond info. I’d happily wear one daily. Nearly million visitors year workplace, visitors infect us kinds plagues. Right they’re limited number, they’re wearing masks, wash sanitize hands they’re here. Protects staff lot things besides covid. protecting Fauci fired? directly contradicted Trump far figure Trump I'm aware of. focus saying effectivity masks?  getting 8 billion people wear (indefinitely, maybe forever, whilst shutting notions bars, pubs, events, ...). That's life, that's basically prison extra steps. life go work, wear mask, stay inside, die. 


Stop looking science side, look human side. 
It's simply realistic. Americans denial right-wing/Republican party war country, govt anyone right-wing Republican. literally shooting people, plotting terrorist attacks kidnappings country denial Republicans = fascist attempting coup democracy.. Wow... there's quote want carved marble. way knowing idea many people infected. cool story mate. end game now. Cheesy know true. either come side, keep ignoring data events like Sturgis. life death. Today Republicans nominate SCJ says wives subservient husbands!!! joke me. TBF, Woodrow Wilson (a democrat) lead us Spanish flu. definitely guilty downplaying it.

True, many countries downplaying due wanting appear weak world war 1. 

The reason even called Spanish flu Spain neutral country war would report accurate numbers details, fact virus originated Kansas. weird numbers far apart country. testing must different, numbers also methods. 

Just look (cases max./hospital/ICU): 

Czech Republic: 8600/2085/408

France: 27000/8000/1500

Netherlands: 6500/1200/235

Germany: 4700/?3000?/530

Example: come Germany fewest cases coupled lowest positivity rate testing still many people ICU? exactly expect political climate non-political issues (e.g. environment public health) politicized. Everything one party approves party *must* oppose it. Yea America Country struggling Corona Virus. Much Europe getting hit hard second time. sound really ignorant statement. That's lot nonsense. Woodrow Wilson would Republican today? Give break. enough doses delivering doses two different things. Tate Reeves dropped mask mandate state like 6th 7th per capita deaths. Jewish woman, tell really DON'T. Let help you. group persecuted, targeted treated DIFFERENTLY others. definitional. others said Haredi treated others held equal standard obeying restrictions put EVEYONE. claim exact opposite we've saying!!

When think tossing around accusation persecution, need first remember story boy cried ""wolf;"" false claims led unhappy ending. Jews running around screaming ""persecution"" every time like something that's happening, people pay attention belive us we're really attached!! dangerous us all!!!! agree. hopeless. Similarities mean alike. literally critical care facilities many counties states. Hard believe Northeast took bullet Mar/Apr still facing problems regions support. 1918...Dems Repigs RePigs Dems, (See: Lincoln, Republican, North, freeing slaves)..do think Republican would fight free slave today???? I'm saying WWI did, many countries. Spanish flu end it, hard time argument. Florida remotely close Sweden part. Also Sweden doesn’t retirement communities like Florida.

The way works month young people get sick, older people hospital fighting virus. Yes yes. Couldn’t agree more. can't completely eliminate it, eliminated lockdowns entire population. Stores around southwest VA signs whatnot masks distancing, there’s enforcement, people aren’t it. There’s single store 30 mile radius feels safe. anti-maskers winning mean, family claimed ""they fear virus,"" broke last month. thought fun person pandemic brought differences them. thought risky seeing her, broke month ago. 8 months pandemic, lol. someone changed behavior yet, doubt near future. doubt truly curious, whatever. 

We actually higher number deaths per 100k Italy. 

Guess what? Population density matters. Italy got slammed super hard March/April dense. density, combined deadly novel virus spread quickly, got hit super hard. overwhelmed healthcare system. thing happened NY/New Jersey. death toll arguably worse Italy's, partially City New York super dense. 

Now, point summer, U.S. overtook Italy. embarrassing big country much less dense Italy lot parts. Florida Texas many deaths embarrassing. goes states. effort contain virus. Combine shitty healthcare system cavalier attitudes end bad results. 

Just look difference two countries. contained virus, not. seeing rise A) going winter months B) likely let guard bit. do, measures Italy took help? Japan's case numbers rather useless, due testing 20-30,000 per day. sister diagnosed yesterday literally said COVID. Another one told less 1% get sick. words Hillaru needs get trouble that. Trumo needs get booted office. mean matter everyone got people act recklessly unless get die. hearing “25%” crowd A&amp;M today, wants home field advantage! 76 years ago entire generation given rifle, 35 ish weeks training told go take beach. many volunteered sense national pride responsibility. 

most dripping stay indoors months save lives. really shows far society plummeted cesspool self entitlement. time life virus kill million people 6 months 2020. Sadly reason masks become politicized Republicans. seems stance days anything opposed left.  Unfortunately stupid people often misunderstand smart advice messenger comes across crazy message doesn’t fit inside limited paradigm. ELI5? Trauma icu high burnout rate. It’s I’ve ever worked.

LSU vs FL 3:30 they’d fill it. DTF downtown packed every night though. don’t think anyone GNV gives fuck anymore tbh. I’m sitting pretty comfortably securely Canada truly worry people vulnerable countries healthcare systems equipped deal high volumes pandemic patients 
:( Really scared family abroad, even government doesn’t recognize issue is. 

While hospitals necessary fighting this, think it’s really important remember actions ripple effect. I’m trying super careful encourage us so, ensure none actions may reason someone catches succumbs it. Let’s aware. Im saying Spanish flu didn’t cause new normal speed limit then? tell everyone take personal responsibility drive 55. Florida opened everything stopped giving even slightest fuck..  give 3 weeks they'll really bad shape can't count high? countries New Zealand South Korea similar politically US yet they're fine. mind, bring cases zero, unless neighbours also zero cases bringing ANYONE third countries covid cases, soon re-open borders...the virus gonna back vengeance.

False. Countries zero cases reopen borders them. Countries enforce lockdown stuck outside feel consequences behaviour. vaccine becomes available anyone wants one, feel most, restrictions end. point, everyone choice risk level keep pronouncing “genuinely” wrong!! thought PhD! People get flu shots still get flu. People read article vaccine effective graphs available? really argument acknowledging Sweden done worse terms COVID numbers? wrong people leaving parents elderly homes pandemic. earth would let risk life. bit old perhaps lack data Germany, France top 3 Europe (80%) together Spain Italy. know serious post, mow got thinking ""quirky glasses"" fashion gor people need glasses like 8 years ago. needs comeback. NY surrounding area owned/founded Dutch, lots religious countryman emigrating US centuries. Unfortunately, requires clarity thought resolve purpose, sorely lacking politicians wider society. 

This democracy fails. Taking unpopular measures directly harms career politician. Telling people want hear situation continues deteriorate benefits you. everyone US get though? life expectancy 70 year old isn’t 6 years though. it’s another 15+ years- enough time see grandchild born part life adulthood. see Hell soon Chinese approach. Long hard lockdown virus gone, rebuild.

We half assed politicians afraid getting reelected anti science voices given megaphone media sake clicks.

Someone needs sacrifice reelection chances initiate lockdown military enforce it. Two months later, people thank we're 5 cases day like China. I'm sure quailifies ""Good News"". Christie dies or, better yet, Trump dies causes people realize hoax everybody masks up, saving hundreds thousands lives process, would ""Good News"". that's strange way saying due vitamin-d deficiency ;-)

Then part strong seasonality covid Brief 2-minute look Viral Seasonal Vitamin Status, Latitude Viral Interactions: Examining epidemiology Vitamin Supplementation Could Reduce Risk Influenza COVID-19 Infections Deaths





In one showed giving people small dose vitamin-d (2000IU), prevented people (~99%) getting seasonal influenza. applaud China way PEOPLE handling situation.

you can't deny central government also great things like building hospitals, mapping genome record time, essentially testing uncharted waters every country stop control spread preventing re-infections. lot unknowns back then. H1N1 took long understand was? post per capita graphs then? need look worse even already worse? It’s like wearing bra. Uncomfortable, hot, restrictive, take whenever I’m home.

Except mask necessary everybody’s health bra mostly required social pressure unless running. be. sort be. 

Global Population 7.8 billion people. born 4 billion. planet cannot sustain many monkeys. We're at, damned close, carrying capacity already. 

One way another herd get thinned. always does. one thing know good thing pandemic like this. already knew data back up. unforutnate going get data future states refusing learn. I’ve actually lived Sweden.

It much socialist.

I'd say let's look evidence specific situations Swiss one posted. Hence, masks work policy everywhere.

And no, Swedish officials recommended complementary tools.

*""On 8 April,* [***ECDC published recommendations line emerging scientific consensus. Although questions remained, “use face masks community could considered,” said, “especially visiting busy, closed spaces.” Tegnell still disagrees. “We looked carefully. evidence country 10x deaths per capita compared neighbour (Norway), absurd public health official telling anyone else do. bad.

Thank much thorough answer! watch / read news, always hear USA Europe, almost never China. That's I'm searching ""reliable sources""; mean virus started China, would nice know they're dealing situation. Almost zero evidence real-world spread outdoors non-crowded environment like park. Indoors gotta watch for. Let damn kids play outside without mask let semblance normalcy lives. Florida earned reputation swamp fully alligators. Honest question: surge instance Spain crowding? Actually, person placebo group, would great news. need certain number placebo group get infected, one either group got infected would idea whether vaccine working not.

People find group study over, find early change behaviour, could make data worthless. Strangely enough, I'm bothered that.

Being dead? That's another matter. CDC published findings examining months US hotspots determined ages 18-24 sparks them, three weeks later, aged 65+ get it. Thank god. thank information. bring money. Virtually won’t make money! sell “god” $29.99... really trying figure part USA called netherlands first first .00005% cases really nothing draw conclusions from

It's not. ones bad enough get tested twice, places exposer needed testing once. Many people get tested. individuals ones samples stored, care many individuals. individuals ones genomes sequenced. individuals ones distinctly different sequences.

You guys densely populated.

The things worked NZ simply work somewhere like New York. realise doesn’t know whether he’s received placebo right. Volunteers don’t get told one receive phase iii

Need hurry summary Boris’ speech, surely don’t reading comprehension primary schooler. Unless course, don’t actually read articles post bit hyperbole general idea information generally date longer correct. Neither Italy Chinese response correct. Lock everyone 2 months, K9 units eat anyone leaves home, lift restrictions virus gone.

Meanwhile democratic governments dawdle posture afraid anything. said ever? cold Coronavirus. need exposed virus get it... really isn’t new information LOL even detailed Chinese standards, Dalian case published person's movements previous five days, went long stayed public place. suppose windows long 3 cases here. also access app-based information.

Looks like city-wide testing again. bright side, decrease probability two cases Qingdao two weeks ago infected surfaces. Diamond Princess 13 deaths 714 cases. That's 1.8% 0.4% fatality. apparently knee jerk reaction losing major game suggested larger crowds home games help. university president athletic director came publicly hours coach said press conference said intention lift attendance limits regardless fact governor lifted them.

This. seems measures short full lockdown basically impact spread virus. seasonal, governments pretended solved summer really happened people went outside sunny. We're Europe, we're going farther grocery store.

What's ""holiday destination?"". don’t think need full lockdown need shut bars restaurants it’s control. sure that’s huge part transmission cycle, seeding new clusters etc. don’t think retail, offices, public transport bad people wear masks though everyone work home. supposed say things like here. matter facts say, freaking mandatory! r/agedlikemilk must treasure trove kind posts.

The better question ""who paid it?"". I'll give one guess. Actually, person placebo group, would great news research. need certain number placebo group get infected, one either group got infected would idea whether vaccine working not.

People find group study over, find early change behaviour, could make data worthless. year old article covid? false hope, need proactive reactive. found. number police. Many ppl commute Madrid work leave work. would drowning traffic jams. Again, argue masks reduce viral load severity. argue arguments trying use proof not.

Sweden officials clear, complementary tools effective measures.  ""Humans?"" Love fellow ""citizens""? There's category error here. average age death covid years higher general life expectancy US.

But yeah generalizing makes sense it. anything show admit reinfections worse? I'm asking attack you. I'm skiing generally looked ice found they're often milder second time. open learning opposing things.

Edit: nvm read article link Nah Berlin actually, rest pretty fine. actually read full interview, you’d know great news 
He’s tested positive, virus solely stayed head, meaning he’s got mild headache/sore throat blocked entering chest/lungs/throat vaccine - making symptoms similar common cold
The second purge good news is, that’ll mean he’s got far less viral load contend - meaning, transmitted someone else, they’d weaker case did, 
This fantastic I’m sure agree statement keep hearing over.

And now, 220k it, people still saying shit. Well, worse...""let's sacrifice elderly good ~~my stock market interests~~ economy!"" also professional victim? No, countries well-funded, highly developed medical systems. Also, medical system would improve patient outcomes influence number community cases population, whereas seeing many cases France Germany. can’t. people far proud selfish admit wrong even realize it. won’t “muh freedumbs”. never believe real data instead choosing believe internet conspiracist read. won’t sociopaths.

if keep cases certain threshold fucked.

Governments seems uncapable learning already unadmissible mistakes.

Fucking idiots, must pay crimes. didn’t even need Javits center hospital ships. Good luck bussines uncontrolled virus around. Oh okay looks like Sweden fared far worse neighbors reasons poor public health policies related covid-19 since beginning. August numbers look like continuation that.

The world probably look East Asian countries worn masks whole pandemic densest cities world.

You could also compare countries previously high death rates without masks low death rates masks (eg Spain) acting stupid stupid? Slightly misleading headline. piece:

“Dr David Nabarro appealed world leaders yesterday, telling stop ""using lockdowns primary control method"" coronavirus.””

And

""The time believe lockdown justified buy time reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources, protect health workers exhausted, large, we'd rather it.""

So saying lockdowns important used necessary allow ‘pause’, single primary control method. definitely dont want argue economically, people always keeps bringing Swedens economy. Swedish Public Health agency beginning said strategy save economy avoid suffering. say quickly end cynical discussions. 

Anyway, study done Scandinavian scientists Sweden, Norway, Denmark Finland comparing effects different measures.

This article goes detail especially cost Norway. study done assumption everyone work home. cost probably higher.

The main part, 1.4 billion per lost school day, total, expected reduction life income missing education. learn less, also, average, earn less money working life, simple assumption.

The rest less productivity parents. compliance rates? mask use 90% Germany, 60% France, could explain lot. Tough find holiday destination Australia. can't go 5km home (Melbourne, Victoria).

My personal guess vaccines faster learning something simple. Maybe could require something like windows must new person gets vehicle exception rain. could require windows cracked outside air times well. late Lockdown coming soon doubt flipped going end us? get point comments. Worse case NZ experiences something similar Europe US now. 

While Europe US spent months thousands people dying every week public living ever changing restrictions, NZers live life normal deaths restrictions. 

Even NZ open eventually months freedom still valuable, opening suffer like US Europe makes sense. Businesses dying lead people dying. can't full social distancing society collapses. economies already suffering lot.

I actually wish socially acceptable wear one sick. would help things like flu season much more. Yes, came price. 

1st Lockdown immeasurable damage. People agreed temporary measure. Fine, lot sacrifice made, appears minimal return.

My career tatters recovery begins must enter lockdown. when? April? I’ll drained savings (with shrunk industry fight candidates get old job back).

If vulnerable - shield. Otherwise, wash hands, wear mask keep distance. Time lockdown. Christie wouldn’t admitted didn’t meet hospital criteria admission.

France spent (wasted) money European country flatten curve virtually eliminated measure caused lot loss. way, france strategy begging people wear masks wash hands. Source: live France.  Americans trying save face. 2 upvotes me! rounding error...are sociopath? cases country. One thing learned original outbreak 2nd smaller one things long tail see end. impossible countries now. That's secondly, tremendous compliance immense goodwill amongst populace get now. goodwill exist anymore without high compliance achieve nothing. possible I'm afraid never really many nations existing laws constitutions.

Population density low. We're heavily urbanised country majority people living cities. Military dictatorship one military bases around world? France get tested get result week later. I'm glad vibe scientifically accurate. WWJD father lives city 20 miles Amsterdam told week ago, pretty much one wearing mask supermarket.

well protect extensions rest planet, definitely speak ill them. Source? There's one China, there's dispute government legitimacy representing China, although judging UN seat quite one sided. that, government public transportation instances care either. work another city car, usually take shifts put outside rush hours, one Friday afternoon. NMBS 3 compartment train. rush hour. Friday. busy destination. train doors even close every single space possible taken (I decided wait get later train, even one social distancing possible). EU closing borders difficult politically (and sometimes logistically, places ""border"" basically non-existent, cities straddle it). Germany better economy, allowed fund healthcare sector better. one highest ICU beds per capita ratios world.

This little communication ""strategy"". fact France locked dow harsher, longer, mandated mask use earlier places Germany. said initial comment. china mish mash outside taiwan? lockdown vaccine including distribution? Lol  need talk risk infection Uber Lyft cars. major untold story.  Taught/ attacked. got ass kicked reasoning home field advantage opponent. wasn’t shitty coaching shitty play, crowd size. Nah.

If cannot figure own, worth conversation with. I’ve read several articles benefits vitamin comes COVID-19 none suggest dosage. pretty, little island taken hurricane sooner later. expected saved several billions - per day - shutting schools, time promised largest investment ever elderlycare.

How save billions leave schools open? Sweden also large push towards working home office, no? (one argument keeping schools closed force parents stay home. anyhow lots Homeoffice.... )

This sound cynical, want strictly argue economically: higher death toll might saved ton money pension payments. Corona death said shave around 10 years average person's life.... assuming kind relational database something. 
They might sending csv files every day manually working data. sure need break you, ""China"" package deal. Nothing policy all-or-nothing. Surely idiom English expressing idea ""learning good avoiding bad"". Usually start dying day tested.  cycling usually go everywhere bike went labs also bike. felt comfortable taking cab knowing may test positive.

But yes right, gotta get testing centers one way another, mean self quarantining lol. right multiplied 47k 27k. That's drunk math you. good scenario placebo, since try real effectivity vaccine, since prevent getting COVID, prevents travelling lungs blood.   Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mean, can't test home, gotta go test center wait line etc. went lab bike trips store got test results. yes, teleworking home. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Indeed. government make clear masks prevent 1) distribution droplets 2) creation ‘clouds’ aerosol around people wearing them. Third reason: People getting infected mask wearing environment tend develop less worse disease quantity virus received lower. fourth place might bit useful pure protection. Dead link absolutely agree, also understand ""ship sailed"" sentiment.

I'd love hear one countries Europe trying contain though, disappoint one thought back case count low... vaccines Due constitutional right freedom religion, government unable force churches limit number churchgoers 30. churches however follow urgent call, except traditional churches Bible Belt. choose lower volume organ singing less loudly, instead.

The Netherlands deep second wave new cases rising every day, point we're worse pretty much country terms new cases per 100k population. AIDS came apes Congo, SARS came bats, Spanish flu came horses pigs. Anywhere animals people closely live together risk. unique China. keep happening. no, stupid people ! 

I know people don’t give single crap politics still thinks coronavirus doesn’t exists isn’t lethal

People way dumb imagine Asia experience pandemics. Korea traumatized MERs much less deadly ramped pandemic response team (the total opposite US dismantled 2018). Koreans also tend HIGHLY educated health obsessed, general. good amount family still lives Korea. necessarily believe stereotype following authority compliant. also talking people protest like crazy feel like wronged citizens literally ousted president long ago (Americans fucking compliant authority considering shit madness Trump). I'm Korean-American really think narrative obedient Asian stupid makes seem like West can't achieve thing bullshit. I'm sure math works roughly equivalent 135,000 cases (and US pop 330 million, 5x population France) I’m French stupid sister (30yo) still thinks coronavirus deadly flu, bit more

Please send someone end humans race worship people iq hamster There's nuance: they've telling people effectiveness masks proven (yet). logical, since need years tests trials different circumstances definitively prove work. long proven, scientist never say so.

The problem people think extremes: ""oh proven yet, work"". RIVM advise masks public transport, social distance cannot guaranteed. Another reason anxious advise masks people masks tend ignore social distance rule feel protected, social distance probably impact spread masks.

Anyway, point: reality always complicated. Problem people react well complicated stuff want clear boundaries rules. There's lot stuff lost translation. read people's lips, everyone wearing masks.. Well Brazil US pretty terribly deaths per capita, think criticism deserved. heat map really bad. ton variance red. expected state 36th per capita deaths red, is. 1/4th numbers versus NY, etc. needs updated. thanks huge brain take That's says all. 🤣😂🤣. read it? ""People stay home feel unsafe."". argue implementation wide array measures protect vulnerable. are, fact, arguing exact opposite declaration posted. Back then, locking necessary understanding virus capable of. Magnitudes people would died lockdowns.

Fast forward today, much better treatments, strategies fight virus, simply, know virus. makes hard lockdowns less necessary before. evidence virus mutated less deadly, pretty much way endemic virus produce permanent sterilizing immunity survivors? heat map really bad. ton variance red. expected state 36th per capita deaths red, is. 1/4th numbers versus NY, etc. needs updated. whole attituded Denmark exhausting. really feels like need reinvent wheel every time sometihng implemented. like believe results countries, test everything Denmark first it. 

Everything considered okay here, damn tiring sometimes. wish would stop seeing sort racist generalization attributing personal characteristics entire country survivable mean bad. reason high survivability numbers right fairly stringent measures contain able provide adequate care patients need it.

Unlike viruses vaccinate for, virus incredibly resilient terms long survive outside host. last report 9 hours. Additionally possible asymptomatic (not show symptoms) carrier. places like S. Korea single infected person able infect hundreds households one day.

When multiple events occur local hospitals easily overwhelmed. Recovery time weeks, particularly spend ventilator, short supply.

And that's short term, idea long term health effects survivors. According [Mayo survivors Covid experience fatigue, breathing issues, headaches, joint pain, brain damage permanent damage heart even children.

Sure good chance surviving it, likely going take years life, potentially spread others, add unnecessary burden health care system. Idk thought reply totally different comment. Yeah probably right. malls? honest churches? open Poland (with masks social distancing, sometimes limits many may inside time) pandemic slow, steady crawl. Local tourism summer lead bit worse spread opening schools led current disaster. 
Africa lower death rate due COVID-19 continents, generally obesity ask whoever drawing blood lie procedure, usually helps patients ton. bringing water Haha exact thought, force people get vaccine. 

I live really conservative area amount people say refuse vaccine mind blowing... people even anti-vaxxers. convinced seasonal flu, sensationalized media thing influence election. Last time got flu shot, passed violently seconds later, flipped chair, hit head floor, made nurse scream, 1 year old son started bawling. 


I'm still gonna first line COVID shot. Maybe much longer, way things going. show economy booming, show billions people lost.

The pandemic real shutting always gross overreaction. Florida death per capita? I’m concerned new cases, I’m talking deaths. Oh, he's hilarious. realize people's lives hinge actions, becomes horrifying.

I'm happy let keep playing fool outside White House. churches owe communities serve? responsible moral thing do? add something gets high won’t able stop people using looks like Europe’s numbers rising also. countries got handle virus China, North Korea, New Zealand. Ya, everyone settings wearing masks correctly. I'm sure.

Are also wearing goggles? Todd Chlorox? mom pharmacist always told growing nasal spray flu shot effective needle age 20-49, mortality rate 0.2%. means many 200,000 age group die COVID (120 millions age 20-49) Human life competing sexual advantage

It's basic biology, think explains attractive people refuse wear masks. takes away biological advantage, making less competitive. terrible, country follow SCIENCE hear word “economy” ... churches sex clubs also reopened Malaysia? someone explain efficacy this? inhaling something make immune way shot would? wouldnt ended this. I’ll take shot barely feel nosebleed. Also, severe asthma = flumist know couple people got ""just going one party"" similar lapse. free go work. feel safe, stay home. 

The side effects mandatory lockdowns focus here. vape, bro? don’t include China, fifth worlds population also virus control

""It’s taking China US side, it’s taking side reason, logic truth. Look politics see truth is: US, UK, lesser extent European governments mismanaged virus outbreak governments like China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan fine.""

Curious don’t include Australia NZ list.

You're looking way white knight china comment nothing China good bad, simply list nothing more, obviously omitted entries. 1= 100%
.10 = 10%
.01 = 1%
.001 = .1%

And on. Great, sounds like country accomplished it!

In US, people still argue goal lockdowns..but metrics would say failed.

That said, US big/diverse place, localized hot spots happening different points time, less hospitals overwhelmed guess metric lockdowns worked? Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Actual scientists say even 60-70% effective would enough end pandemic. 80% effective vaccines won’t coming within next year. I’m saying is, can’t excellent without relying government mandate us so? think everyone would wear pants without told to. 

Communication top US sucked federal level states (all handful). even CDC waffled nature virus (airborne not) whether masks effective not. 

But I’m truly disappointed people general acted (Karens whatnot). rallied around defeating thing socially (or anti-socially case may be) terms mobilizing industry find vaccine manufacture masks. takes much top approach. 

If mandate, need enforce. happens quite kerfuffle moment around defunding enforcement agencies result poor enforcement techniques. 

Wearing mask (especially), keeping physical distance limiting social engagements might help keep us shut economy seems like reasonable things without much direction. happen.

It's easiest thing country do. plan airborne virus. lockdown. yet. certainly way. asked italy deaths per million america... Claiming lcokdowns didnt help.... lockdowns helped.  New york hit hard beginning lockdowned.  new york followed safety measures.  New york basically covid free 6 months.  

Meanwhile florida anti mask pro trump stupid 3500 new covid cases yesterday.  

The virus spreading indoor restaurants , large gatherings schools. really dont understand confused this... know that? look Sweden. dying Probably month two see goes. Dude cracks up. don’t think trump funny you’re lying. Terrible person, funny fuck. Delaying herd immunity incredibly stupid.

Acquiring herd immunity without vaccine stupid. possible SOLUTION save lives... regrettably word « lockdown » bad connotations... call « virus eradication period » , « war home » positive wordings? damn shot save life lives others, get irrational fear skin prick get best vaccine. Development time inhaled vaccines longer syringe route administration Well it’s really 250k since undercounting deaths 20%. act like numerous $1200 checks dropped, that’s simply case. 

Also literally dozens experts said there’s way COVID gets eradicated US, even 30 day lockdown. simply widespread. Stuff like used happen time viral infections, we’ve forgotten society we’ve able keep control last 50 years thanks vaccines.

I'm pumped get flu shot. Vaccines cheap free (with insurance) good stuff. That's quite conclusion jumping there. Based absolutely nothing obvious distain way thinking. wonder idiot really is. think replied wrong message, anyway, agree you. Also elderly. Feel kids.

I've actually got full text speech (unfortunately) listened full speech.

Boris support Brexit, unsurprisingly talk negative light speech. fact Brexit talk painting rosy picture future ragging Labour 'stopping delivering Brexit'. 

The going back normal bit seems contradicted ""we working day life back normal"" ""we ensure next time meet face face cheek jowl"" (referring next conservative party conference). However see got confused ""it isn’t enough go back normal"" referring chronic problems refer next sentence.

Your third paragraph basically bollocks. makes mention testing/contact tracing anywhere, fact accuses Labour supporting extending furlough (""there many regard state expansion progress, want keep state supporting furlough forever, keep people suspended animation""). Boris really say much short term future speech (which main criticism it), mention future covid cases/deaths opening up. again, 2019 thing better regards infrastructure economic opportunities.

For someone think wants encourage 'new normal', seems quite disparaging it, calling elbow touching ""some giant national version Birdie dance"" hairdressers wearing face shields looking ""as though handling radioactive isotopes"". Also Build Back Better three word slogan, he's Prime Minister UK, England (at least now). also forgot promises nurses hospitals, involving private sector state spending fixed rate mortgages help young people homes.

America truly care people unable work poor. leave room can’t remember patient said,” said, adding hadn’t exhausted medical leave she’d take time off.

That America. Can't afford take time recover. loses job, risks losing health insurance never getting treatment needs. isn’t new. 

We (and many eye clinics Australia) received ophthalmic alerts COVID related eye infections back things still going crazy Wuhan March (FYI alert came American ophthalmic association). incredibly rare going case reports, adjusted screening protocols accordingly. 

There possibility viral aerosol droplets enter body conjunctiva eye. Conjunctivitis (pink eye) possible symptom COVID provided occur fever, dry cough, shortness breath. 

Again stress super rare, please don’t start trying disinfect eyes. Honestly aerosols reached conjunctiva, chances already reached nose/mouth. Wear mask, wash hands don’t touch face it’ll ok. Nabarro praised GB Declaration, however, explicitly.  


Do trust WHO, global organization United Nations, blog 10,000 people, editors hold particularly strong credentials (you look up), particularly compared WHO? 


Mike Ryan, WHO, also agreed another article Nabarro, incidentally. FUCK VIRUS. Well, access local news, usually language reasons, statistics rely on. Like said, numbers Germany look good, general ""surge"" population. small number stupid people piss poor management one specific industry.

Our restaurants bars open 50% capacity half tables chairs upside taped down, pretty good indication can't sit there. can't approach bar either. staff come they're wearing masks. Guests must disinfect hands arrival remove masks seated.

You must also fill tracking form, name, address, phone number, number table sitting aprox times arrive leave. might sound ridiculous you, people even carry pen them, fill form. 

There fines place fake names many people registered Donald Duck. Bar owners supposed call police someone that. Germany, rules starting point negotiations. don’t really anything “good” getting tested tho. said you. reddit. Nobody asks anything.

lmao talking about?

Oh no, asked question, guess I'm breaking rules Good thing one Australia's biggest tourist sources also major country got virus control

Bad news Australia decided start cold war country, let racist hate crimes go rampant country's travel safety advisory list.


But hey theres always New Zealand straight propaganda.

It's goddamn business neighbors take vacation. Population size matter Lockdowns supposed interrupt slow initial spread US never full “lockdown.” Many stores stayed open essential people allowed go family trips Target Home Depot, maskless. Going walks encouraged. countries (Spain) pre-register leave house could go get food, medicine, take dog short walk. Police patrolled streets would verify approved out. I'll tolerate vaccines applied everyone. stay home point. sound harsh, Christ. Restricted gatherings lockdown. It’s public health recommendation common sense. can’t run around HIV bang everyone want without protection despite HIV infections control? children’s hospitals allowed visitors every single flu season? premise. definition, “lockdown” way, shape, form may either! Nowhere US reached goals yet even though attainable within weeks.

Maybe US lockdowns correctly. Italian Chinese style lockdowns, 1 person per family leave house week buy groceries? Well said may effective spray due nose mouth location entry... think missed point. fair, Washington Examiner sort print equivalent FOX News. Proudly so, think secret. That's lower bound. Add another 60K excess deaths ballpark. article says, squandered time, unfortunately.

Did flatten curve? Afaik hospitals past max capacity long time. Thousands experts around world come lockdowns. everything Trump. depends ""lockdowns"" defined. WHO, article, states people need ""go holiday."" article.

They clearly view closing global borders ""locking down"" based above. reason, state it, caused much global poverty hardship people. implies believe countries also closed things also may cause localized poverty hardship. Primarily intensive contact tracing localized containment rather national lockdowns. note guy mention US. right leaning publications talking do. WHOs Nabarro talks impoverished nations mostly. Exactly. basic research making grossly hyperbolic claims. whole point make sure hospitals weren’t overrun. original idea keep restrictions place ensure steady trickle hospital patients one mass wave. places US couple people hospital restricted gatherings? purpose restrictions never reduce total number people going infected, spread longer time. like this. One gripes vaccines by-pass lot immune system. means inoculation one chose choice. isn’t true. Surgical masks mitigate spread. Masks ”useless” people don’t wear **Their** model (I guess easier whine scientists tell one), actually predicted this. Quit drama lama. regional hospitals scaled non urgent care. hospitalisations IC admittance pretty low helps. ""and next trick, accurately counting infected"" Lol still struggling get frontline workers PPE makes people think vaccine roll smooth process? Can't x cases ICU x ICU beds. Germany beds, ergo Germany ICU cases. 2nd quarter GDP shrank 12% QoQ, compared 8% QoQ shrinkage condescending asshole feeling superior time

What? things go hand hand.

My comment perfect example. think math may broken. fatality rates Scroll way table link. think official talking affected industries like tourism, restaurants &amp; entertainment venues. Many developing countries depend solely rich tourists coming abroad injecting hard dollars/euros/yuan economies. Needles dont bother yet hated blood thinner shots. name escapes right shit burns. last time hospital. arizona worst per capita ive seen recent months, nearly 500 per 100k per day couple weeks.  still plenty businesses shut across country, depending live, threats shut (see NYC). Schools still closed many places. lockdown measures impact economy (and I’m talking stock market billionaires, jobs tax revenue services), well domestic abuse, poverty, hunger, crime, likely years come. 

I’ll also mention WORLD Health Organization, CDC. many places around world, lockdowns rolling continuous terrible people live (and haven’t even worked- see Argentina). Ok terms washing clothes, went say store gym, would instantly throw wash afterwards? clothes you’d worked in, stuff maybe touched surface?

I feel like I’ve gone deep end comes laundry worried surface transmission could make intelligent reply...but waste time. Definitely ton fun run n95 Yes, article says, squandered time, unfortunately. supposed take weeks come better plan. not. many countries. expressly concerned Europe said articles. Whether government mandates masks, closing restaurants, whatever, one thing. nothing stopping individual American wearing mask, avoiding restaurants, football games, mall, etc., died covid, many followed medical advice? many maintained social distancing? may wore mask prescribed health authorities? 

But hey, probably easier blame government, someone else, personal failings. means we'll get extra tough generation. Good thing. Life getting easy EU. made up...

most people believed Earth flat much smaller...including ""smartest"" people day...until particular explorer challenged that. See Magellan.

most viruses Frankly moralistic articles getting annoying boring. care whether believe yet somehow able defeat measles. hospital work covid floor now. It’s busy spring, there’s always positives investigation. nursing attrition astounding. stuck around thought would converted back former specialty, found going covid long(er) term broke. It’s exhausting taking care patients. It’s much. Colorado might. Polis isn’t messing around. BLM movement burden proof person making claim. response? Looking forward it.... viable unbiased one comes about. Okay, please post it, I've never seen it. TN resident, confidently say living like virus here. governor fanboy US “leader.” many stubborn residents watch Fox. mask mandate. Yea friend said ""I stopped watching news reporting different covid numbers."" Uh started reading could get hands point Red, Blue, much international news able read. get ""Everyone said guy good put head sand stopped taking information."" Okay, make masks mandatory. Mandatory mask mandates much preferable mandatory lockdowns masks ruin economy. 7 months later we’re still buying time? It’s entirely political now....left governors won’t open might make things look like they’re improving vice versa Yeah I’m kinda getting now


I thinking we’re talking states, oops Yes does, come think doesn't? I'm really confused. First blame world virus spiraling control tell governments take action stop spread they're lockdowns. WTF? one wants go lockdown nothing else seems work. It’s first method plenty places continuously threatened again. Argentina 200 days harsh lockdown still doesn’t control. 

This news. Especially also many people sub hoped harder, harsher lockdown. I’m glad shared noticed. seems reasonable countries america healthcare life sentence debt think help antivaxxer people get it? Like actual injection all, know? paper linked supports masks help, many papers. bizarre, copy-pasting comment everywhere people told it, yet insist cherry picked data even support conclusion. you’ve ever gotten flu shot nose, you’ll wanna go needles lol  Why? CDC credible fits narrative? 

Also, here’s source absurdly low IFR covid: another question - virus can't survive long outside body, enough masks use one leave unused couple days, safe use even wash it, right? know Covid? You’re mincing words. Obviously democracy, Sweden socialist know virus like soap much. virus survive long time cotton. normal wash cycle even 30 24h storage enough virus lets forget humid climate mask face sorts bacteria fungi thrive irritate skin. better safe sorry well ironed mask feels good. starters, US lockdown sense describes.

The lockdowns described draconian US has. can't even get people wear masks essential activities like shopping, let alone stop throwing parties dumb stuff.

Lockdowns countries stricter writing also enforced. Sometimes militantly. 

The US also theoretically enough wealth let poor survive providing food, shelter and/or money. Oh freaking health care. done extent halting evictions stimulus checks money run US government more.

The point Nabarro making lockdowns last resort. free health care here, maybe could get people tested enough tighter, smaller mini quarantines restrictions whatnot... can't ""muh freedom"" contingent country. [person woman man camera wonder worse immune system off. Getting Covid-19, getting vaccine Covid-19. math. half EU still lockdown.

Go figure. get every vaccine! Us needle phobes get one! 3-5 masks per person house, toss laundry wearing. obviously no, don’t need wash didn’t wear it. situation hospitals may ask? Idk living people wearing 85% time. Still large gatherings zero mask wearing. temperature least 140 degrees. no, guys going that.

how ineffective masks? read actual study, even used correctly talking 16% reduction risk infection wear one properly every day 30 days. know people want that's enough stop contagious upper respiratory infection, slow little bit. herd immunity strategy, inevitability. 


never thankful live small town, even servers cashiers often participate political virtue signaling. number people know covid-19 14, every single one fine week. person know died older relative. ever contract covid 19, fell injured therapy delayed bc lockdowns, died weeks later hospital bed unable move last several days Anyone heading Florida Northern state idiot.

A friend mine works support diseased children, another friend works dying old people … mind blocks analogy. thought exactly. friend sent articles basically saying Bill Gates released covid purpose, creating vaccine modify genes specialized EM radiation phones trigger something change behavior. thing referenced real technology called optogenetics didn’t know existed: actually productive discussion think convinced would difficult encode kind meaningful behavior modification message without directly implanting light source near targeted area brain. technique section says insert fiber optic cables mouse’s skull work. light absorbed phones would eyes, trigger rod cone cells. can’t reach areas brain besides optic areas.

It’s meaningless data unless want compare case numbers previous Sundays. says state means country. obviously American. 350 unemployment wtf. worse permanent disability? that’s Florida now.  certain high-profile patient won’t able tell difference. yet 95% anti-maskers never see 5% believe it, least believe significant.

Around 70% country making huge sacrifices protect idiots, everyone else.. bunch 70% reluctantly though.

They see 7+ million infected, 200k+ dead think either big deal exaggerated, worth shutting down. get 100's million Americans billions people around world making huge sacrifices, unprecedented lifetime, prevent getting worse.

If got way everyone would selfish them, we'd 10x worse least. Millions Americans dead, tens millions suffering, possibly life altering side effects.

Then get overwhelming healthcare... People could survived dying hospitals full doctors overwhelmed, stressed beyond belief, making mistakes fatigue, decide let die.  10x deaths turns 20x...

And taunt, yell at, attack people literally protecting themselves. Probably didn’t make list funeral insistent taking virus seriously. data lockdowns causing large number deaths many reasons

No hasn't.

Yeah, people 65+ historically committed suicides pandemic (out fear) age groups virtually poverty, hunger, abuse, serious issues

Living beyond means dysfunctional relationship virus' fault. going work instead facing problems solution.

Americans need learn ""entitlement"" (a word least-common-denominators country love throwing around blindly) really means they're to. You’re wrong sub don’t coronavirus stories. seems like everyone’s talking since March, though. see travel China.... 630 million last major holiday (which lasted week two different calendars coincided) yes, would like provide one source? Listen, really obvious type reddit commenter declare fiat evidence like invalid. I'll give one shot, move on, I've come across kind thing before. actual health expert: stop locking 
Random redditor: misguided dangerous!!1!  /r/ihavesex Wife visited Colorado mask mandate shutdown school closed something Marchish. people wearing masks servers. oddly opposite me. nowhere near close true. evidence even 8 billion people magically okay, 4 billion okay. Thanks. worse. social distance without proven community benefits end ruining economy live poverty 50’s decided react virus 20s. Anyone using East German Secret Police username would opinion. New York locked harder country much much worse off. Florida Georgia hand relatively good positions despite early opening school. Frozen food, hopefully cooking 165 degrees anyway

Doesn't work well ice-cream. trump right along. never listened It’s deaths vs quality life. It’s deaths vs deaths. There’s debate fact overdoses suicides increased, cancer diagnosis gone (in places 50%!), less spending west leads famine developing countries. It’s deaths vs deaths + freedom. don’t know many deaths lockdowns cause I’ve read intriguing economic analysis argue it’s nearly 10x amount die Covid. 

We need discussion, nobody willing talk it. Every news agency reports x cases ignores deaths caused lockdowns. fuck about? goes say:

*""Just look what’s happened tourism industry Caribbean, example, Pacific people aren’t taking holidays,” said.*

As need stop lockdowns tourism suffering, got bad first place? thought supposed rational voice science Netherlands ""bible belt"" need wash every day even use day? God would hate dentist people freedoms ripped away either permanently long-term you’re scared virus?

We rules placed society protect people, sure, they’re reasonable laws don’t infringe civil liberties. law prevents spilling garbage garden fair isn’t serious threat liberties, also doesn’t affect ability earn living keep roof head. Lockdowns both, it’s fair comparison all. always around

wow it’s almost like shouldn’t use lockdowns primary virus control method fondly recall Christmas market Nuremberg Wurzburg. hot wine Christmas stalls amazing site. suppose time changes things, better worst. Bad bot live Europe &amp; still risk holidaying Europe Unemployment maxes 350ish dollars week depending state CDC reputable random redditor. think anybody common sense hates needles honest. wear enough it’s safe lift lockdown. Doesn’t also reduce viral load intake? Cause important thing reducing many viruses enter. real problem show virus material surface. shown Germany months ago said material can't cultivated, grow. contagious. call seriously misleading headline. kids like 180 good way. daugher less anxious go school, shes calm focus better homeschooling, work shes working on. son also relaxed. miss friends course used seeing family year time. Personally life changed much routine wise homeschooling. table look IFR. What? 

It’s measure put place state. idea it’s called English French it’s « activité partielle » « chômage partiel », meaning “partial unemployment”.

In order avoid people getting fired companies pay staff limited revenue, state pays large portion salaries stay employed things turn around.

NZ also ended lockdown May, still maintaining restrictions. point, whole ""the lockdown ended early!"" excuse work. scary leave echo chamber

Mr President, projecting one alts again. Yeah Swedish authorities lying saying ""this always plan"" since Swedes brainwashed morons get away it. 99.95% survival rate please respect .05% people die virus. nights drinking wait. true, happen run science denying C0NServatives. Fun story - group 360 tourists Poland, 140 tested positive upon arrival Egypt. Skeptical unusual occurrence (there way would already positive getting infected plane, would infected beforehand high proportion, statistically absurd), took another test error. Take it, wish, would personally conclude Egyptian anti-covid measures ... great least. misinformation sub, least doesn’t kill people. Physical distancing solve economy. There's false choice saving economy solving disease, go together. Countries beat back covid earlier able open people work again. want reduce poverty keep distance wear mask. mean quarantine whole good thing. meant positive effect son's personality.  good resource. CDC taken consideration recommend use facemasks public prevent spreading, prevent catching disease, papers study. important section paper discussing ""Facemasks source control"" states obvious: effective catching exhaled viral particles. guess could lie like instead?

We fucked corona response, absolve everyone else mistakes either. Sneak back sheets hanging windows. Imagine hating Trump, like us, hate much you’re willing risk killing innocent people can’t get vaccines due medical reasons....so make political statement. Just, wow.  trying tell us? ; ) try open up, cases increase deaths follow. doesn’t matter political affiliation state has. separate issues. remain separate. You’re assuming ideology continue pretending know COVID scientists. 

And trying feign concern climate change, make COVID somehow stop killing people. 

What’s next? Pence missed embalming touch up, hence fly red liquifying left eye. tend label others already labeled.. Original comment brought Australia brought Melbourne people lived prisoners half year. put mention city made comment irrelevant topic.

But sure grass always greener side. mentioned Riga mention Visby?? science-supported truth. harsh you? Oh one scientific deniers, got it. 

Take leave it.  point shutting border virus similarly prevalent sides. newly found outlet xenophobia. good example lockdown Hubei, lasted 2-3 months, depending area. mass testing Wuhan suggest lockdown eliminate virus completely. answer 8-12 weeks. Comparing US Sweden without considering massive difference two pointless. differ every way. contact tracing would know, since we’re there’s way anyone know came Disney.

I’m really less concerned park itself, Disney lure bring people together airports, buses, restaurants, etc. Thats danger is.  Thats stuff! mean good faith? looking persuaded anything mean that. would nice see detailed reasoning. Notice even specify view... ""your view"". Applies us equally. Planetary? Intergalactic? blame gta v Thanks doctor. primary means control virus,

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* thought too. Yikes guys need get familiar reality. zero logistical reason vaccine wouldn’t available spring. Canada reopening cases increasing. states wide open many lifting restrictions months. kid’s doctor said stopped using flu didn’t work. speaking literally. Italy currently seeing rise cases China much locking down. Life China immediately jump back normalcy Wuhan lockdown ended, still testing, contact tracing, distancing, quarantining, changed. China still plenty cases lockdown ended well, get rid systems pretend COVID disappeared. 

An efficient lockdown making long harsh, efficient lockdown buys time life *after* lockdown. big country can't take responsiblity done, sends minions laughable execuses. ""side"" ""side"" ""everyone else"".  80% reporters scientists team create side misinform you.  jobs reported facts. large coordination conspiracy talking points. 

It's Republicans circling wagons, acting like corrupt idiots, dividing rest humanity. hope people sub watch closely, happens think mask order good measure pandemic. that's government things started picking up, instead real measures limit human interaction, scrambling put together now. wasted several weeks ""we mask order wait see effect"", now. Yup, edited title. ""Coronavirus: Florida reports 5,570 new cases Sunday missing day due inaccurate data dump"" 


Surprised? working hospital care facility, course see worst attitudes towards Covid. us long-haulers caught March still struggling 7 months... moments lately actually feel worse first month (and pretry fucking bad back then). can't remember struggle breathe everyday like anymore.

Only recently UK started make headline news, supposedly NHS officially recognise ""long covid"" set recovery services across country. I've still yet hear Boris even mention long-haulers though... felt like flip flopped alot beginning due politics.
Canada locking good before. Educate us please Thanks link. Norway well too. small spike, got control. right health, too? Obviously two rights collision here, think common sense solution (banning it) prevail. know. It’s scary leave echo chamber. It’s ok. 

I wish virus would end focus energy things matter. Like climate change, actual threat man kind. could easily take away peoples rights choose wether want vaccine not. start spraying shit streets.... want breathe that. say wether vaccinate body not. seen bunch news Disney super spreader? think would news article two bunch people getting COVID went Disney. Sure, agreed. Yes. China spread disinformation flu hoax intentionally ruined effort handling coronavirus several countries. New Zealand 300 mil population begin first place. Please note Florida report yesterday. today's report two days.  imo nothing special compared two days ago. Well i’m fighting coronavirus Tegrity Special Sauce *now wax form stay home feel safe selfish. seem wildly missing point.

I even said initial post clearly understand either. took forever admit pandemic, took forever admit covid aerosolized respiratory droplets even though Japan figured February. certainly innocent whole mess  Nobody claiming anybody is. Throw stomach acid *incredibly* strict lockdowns working places like Philippines? can’t even leave home you’re 60...but people keep dying... happened me. completely lost sense smell 80% sense taste (the two linked loss taste profound suspect direct effect losing sense smell).

they came back slowly week, thankfully. noted, people *want* believe disinformation.

For part, stop worrying them, can't change them.  believe different information hear sources (read: wingnuts) already like respect.

In words, conservatives start loving masks heroes Trump tell wear way fight ""Chinavirus"" ""Democrat hoax."" since going that, going change. Thanks.
I particularly like part priorising regular testing nursing staff.

Good luck! easily. People New Zealand citizens permanent residents dependents permitted entry. Exemptions granted 'critical purpose' unlikely apply unless already connection New I've brain fog 8 years unknown virus. people permanent. What’s say won’t side effects manifest years now?  show horrific example though, later contradict brush off. It’s unsupported. I’d really like fauci scientists stop making conservative ass estimates we’ll back normal frankly puts lot people depression even it’s necessarily true absolutely measure that, scientists have. take different samples try grow healthy viral populations petri dish, *in vitro* growth favorable possible grow there, ain't growing human body. general finding wrt corona virus 35 CT virtually impossible. people (assuming early viral growth process, noted above) contagious. Period end story. Good luck you. get better eventually. :( stay positive. try injecting bleach next. heard reputable sources make virus disappear instantly. Like miracle. Could Easter Bunny. started back then. Totally explains -Facebook mommy. Miller Kushner definitely reptilian

Forgot add Pence wiped nothing since March. A-OK. 

Wipe away unnecessary. PLEASE TAKE FAMILY!!! I'd respond believed picosecond arguing good faith. 
But since sealioning, .... sort evidence provide someone doesn’t value evidence? 

Unfortunately we’re left trying come marketing like stories get people adopt evidence. Unfortunately people opposing evidence much better marketing. George Bush Administration Pandemic Pandemic thrown 15 years institutional learning coronavirus outbreak rapidly spread across world United States, number public health experts within outside federal government sounded alarm severity crisis email chain called ""Red Nearly 80 pages emails obtained via public records requests published full New York correspondence initially started Department Homeland Security's top medical officer Duane Caneva eventually expanded include top officials Department Homeland Security, Health &amp; Human Services, Centers Disease Control Prevention, Department Veterans Affairs, Trump's former Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert, number top academics infectious disease specialists.
In addition ""Red Dawn"" emails, Times also published lengthy, investigative review instances Trump brushed aside warnings severity coronavirus crisis, failed act, belabored significant infighting mixed messages White House action take when. Lol wish covid19 black plague. Assuming become antibiotic resistant would never really spread would ago. Hopefully people stop getting paid work public support lockdowns ends. Exactly. misinfo population exclusive right. Thats horrific part. Sorry, what? ""Endocrine Society"" increased recommended levels Vitamin due influence Dr. Holick, may monetary conflicts Holick’s role drafting national vitamin guidelines, embrace message mainstream doctors wellness gurus alike, helped push supplement sales $936 million 2017. That’s ninefold increase previous decade. Lab tests vitamin deficiency spiked, too: Doctors ordered 10 million Medicare patients 2016, 547 percent since 2007, cost $365 million.

These guidelines also recommend levels Vitamin may amount vitamin typical daily supplement generally considered safe, possible take much. 2015, article American Journal Medicine linked blood levels low 50 nanograms per milliliter increased risk death. That’s within level considered healthy Endocrine Society, defined vitamin “sufficiency” 30 100 nanograms, Rosen said.

I especially curious Institute Medicine prestigious National Academy Medicine (then known Institute Medicine), group independent scientific experts, issued comprehensive, 1,132-page report vitamin deficiency. concluded vast majority Americans get plenty hormone naturally, advised doctors test patients high risk certain disorders, osteoporosis.

But Dr Holick's paper months later, June 2011, Dr. Holick oversaw publication report took starkly different view. paper, peer-reviewed Journal Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism, behalf Endocrine Society, field’s foremost professional group, whose guidelines widely used hospitals, physicians commercial labs nationwide, including Quest. society adopted Dr. Holick’s position “vitamin deficiency common age groups” advocated huge expansion vitamin testing, targeting half United States population, including black, Hispanic obese — groups tend lower vitamin levels me, pushing nearly billion dollar (probably now) supplement industry reeks snake oil. believe lockdown government restricts freedom movement, agree disagree.  one afford it, one take it. Personally, there’s second stimulus, major improvement contact tracing, huge increase rapid testing, I’m hearing single word it. Unless vaccine 100% effective (it be) people still infected goal (according UK itself) lower severity vaccinated (which less half population) Can't still passed people then? ignore experts. think almost 0 risk catching COVID walking someone jogging, biking, hiking without mask. director infectious disease Brigham women’s Boston actually talked radio show last week. literally air said tells friends scream yell joggers jogging without masks extremely, extremely unlikely transmit COVID way.

When I’m walking around town it’s crowded I’ll wear it. I’m hiking climbing mountains pass someone without mask 10 seconds, don’t sweat it. That’s virus spreads. I’m definitely stopping talk strangers like used though. future reference, questions like best directed Daily Discussion Post.

Hopefully year learnt lot thing help reduce future flu season Well thats still pile shit. lock early hard saves experience apocalyptic senario seeing.

You act proactivly, reactivly.

Acting reactivly exactly countries like Sweden total hellscapes atm. There’s always take out. went hiking MD friend weekend, said thing going hospital. Reduced number flu patients, due mask wearing social distancing Huh, actually changed mind?

While want vaccine certainly want first line. I'm happy wait couple months mission February investigate origins virus. read would like.

The recent mission PRC, July, team sitting Beijing [3 guess investigation team made clairvoyants need physical evidence based investigations. Never trust anyone cannot hold personally accountable. hate say could case at. deaths 64. Schools started early August 5 nursing home outbreaks. found weird let family members still see nursing home patients let high school students leave high school work nursing home. mom hospital dr said send nursing home recovery. taking care hardest job ever had. Sometime around spring 2021 start accepting never going quite before.

Things like WFH extremely common. Open layout offices fall fashion. Live music outdoors much often. People expect shake hands.

Society distinct pre post covid. don’t get predict sort thing. It’s even really vaccine point, it’s everyone personally says enough enough. opinion, we’ll back normal next summer regardless pretty much outside factors (vaccine, treatment, cases). price able pay forever. Half sub despises science point. People say Gates fearmongering (their favorite word!) even though everyone credibility warning bad fall winter beginning. He's alone here. Argentina technically still lockdown, 6 months counting. 
Of course reality different people going regardless, day still theorically need paperwork stating going 5 blocks residence cannot leave enter cities unless police woke feeling nice day. 
The consecuence absolutely idea allowed isn't. think small gatherings outdoors allowed, housekeeping too. hear someone got arrested walking dog sunday, idea anymore. spike started month go college kids. go cases age see early month September. There's huge lage deaths this. 3 oldest age brackets seeing highest numbers last week. Deaths trending would believe still going continue go even much more.  key.

If government U.S. supported people, shut could nationwide, lasted two months, felt like pajama party people home paid eat delivery.

Just make sure unemployment benefits there, freeze rent mortgage two months floating banks.

Pretty straight forward. dude many fake accounts gonna make long time particular television programming causing misinformation sociopolitical division, it’s turned full-on national security threat directly responsible loss lives :/ No. Yep. IgA would effective me, one parent comments points out, requires use live attenuated virus, could flat dangerous. 

Also interesting since something like 1 500 (in US, similarly high countries) healthy blood donors low IgA, could significantly affect efficacy. 

Still, weapons better long run. COVID, would get vaccine? Even wasn’t fast tracked?  TSA lockdowns security theater harm good.

Both go away. say Donald Trump’s right get vaccine Election Day. pandemic magically go away get back normal, really. fact, according panel experts Cap Times Idea Fest, we’ll masking social distancing time come. things get back normal, won’t normal we’re used to.



TL/DR: going take time get everyone vaccinated properly, things back normal vaccine approved. Oxford vaccine right? one trial still pause US? get nothing then? :( Wrong again.  think it’s fine. going climbing gym 4 days week since early June. Masks mandatory, people keep distance, hand sanitizer everywhere, it’s capped less half capacity. feel pretty safe. 

I won’t go bars, restaurants, parties, large, unmasked gatherings. definitely feel safe gym. Maybe it’s also mix bias/risk tolerance, long gym open masks mandatory, I’ll going.

I haven’t seen many articles cases traced back gyms mandatory mask requirements. seems main drivers right bars, restaurants, parties. gym operating capacity (either member time slot reservations), masks mandatory (and compliance there, experience gym, everyone complying), think it’s pretty safe. Glad Trump pro-science creating vaccine. Yeah, schools open Thankfully, no. It’s called Hyperadrenergic Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (h-POTS). It’s combination autonomic nervous system moving blood around properly adrenal gland producing much adrenaline body “fight flight mode” times, even I’m sleeping (which means sleeping really hard). 

When stand, stress hormones, heart rate, blood pressure skyrocket, don’t get enough oxygen brain. makes lose vision, get sharp headache, dizzy, blood pools legs making really heavy achy, collapse lot. It’s similar fainting, rarely lose consciousness anymore. worst symptom far though nausea. I’m exaggerating say level nauseous times least past ten years.

It’s kind disease range mild severe, severe case whatever reason. I’m seeing new electrophysiologist specializes though (they rare, mine hours away), I’m pretty hopeful improve quality life least little bit. 

Thankfully, won’t shorten life span, hurting fall, it’s dangerous, miserable. sure makes sense. Whatever, though. Well fatass kills people annually, so.... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Well, fair, dead people don’t contribute economy. I’m even going check username know exactly you’re talking about. person troll preys anxieties others. don’t believe second believe anything sit spew miserably day long, day day. sad life. governinobody afraid healthcare system overrun still using various levels lockdown. Lol nope. thanks I’ll pass. that’s sounds worse needle That's new daily record. asked reasoning selfish reasons mostly yes free say nothing think worth time. find bit weird people except ""accept"" things tell that's probably me. I'm going keep laying low ignore people think laying low weak.

Nothing weak wanting protect yourself. I've lockdown since March I'm vulnerable. Spent 20s fighting disease desperately want living life, I'd rather keep laying low things improve carry living life without issues caused getting covid (hopefully!). There's guarantee could achieve herd immunity. coronaviruses produce long-term immunity humans. viable ""fix"" situation all, might even possible. depends. literally nothing hating trump. I'm pregnant trust rushed vaccine idea safe pregnant breastfeeding woman. Hillary office take rushed vaccine either. especially trust dude told us inhale bleach. wear mask, go store essentials already Covid. I'm putting anyone risk. He's also dallas cowboys fan. proven wrong came travel bans. would nice stuck Thailand right now. speaks vast experience dealing viruses. Well, dad started refusing wear mask, he's coughing, acting super sketchy health.

Great. I'm sure decades smoking make covid breeze.. China also things like weld apartment blocks shut people leave... charts comparing insane. went Nationwide Lockdown early around time Flu Season would usually pick up. 


Over next 8 weeks something would usually tens thousands influenza cases stage less 10 nationwide. one takes seriously affects personally, someone know dies it. I’m totally losing faith human race. wonders people's willingness cooperate. one view is, ""The community epidemiologists concerned rapidity spread suggests utilize emergency measures reduce spread,"" is, ""Drink bleach,"" feel need defend it. Thats point guy stole steve jobs idea authority global pandemics?

Gimmie Fauci entomologist, ill listen. Im tired computer programmar wife go authorty pandemics. Schools linked epidemiological spokes no. Good luck getting people take precautions vaccine widely distributed.


But seems point quoting.



It take time widely distribute vaccine, especially requires zero temps transportation storage, possibly two doses.



These stories trying prepare people give precautions moment vaccine cleared, begins roll out. hell talking about?

wiping groceries means work? insane? like, really, ok? Coronavirus likes this. knew this, listing like makes realize US began bunch 17th century versions social media startups like Facebook. 

Facebook tells us mission bringing world together, real purpose bring us together sell ads data, get rich. 

Americans tell founding mission freedom escape persecution, like Facebook, that’s PR spin. 

The real mission bring people together one place investors could get rich labor. wipe mine soapy rag real quick. get like couple bags frozen veggies meat ever two weeks takes couple seconds. wipe handles milk jugs pretty much everything else gets set aside days. doubt significant risk figure helps cut possible salmonella contamination well. talking about, dude? went China Febuary recently. 

Since really want uncover origin coronavirus, make sense also investigate America test first month particularly bad flu season CDC admitted coronavirus deaths confused flu upon pothhumous studies?Would make sense also investigate Spain France found coronavirus sewer water samples dated long first case China? China's position is, want find origin,don't let suspects get away looking them. America even pulled WHO. really afraid investigation? 

Unbiased, guess mean something like WMD Iraq, right?

Would funny think America allies represent unbised. History's funniest joke colonial imperial powers last 5 centuries claim champion justice now.

DRC who? rogue state recognized pretty much every country world, including own, likely. going long hard winter too. Poor nurses. Bolsonaro take lead? go full circle.

As 2020 Contagion get documentary tag streaming services.

Well ""bad one"" / un-realistic one enough idiots denying virus. medical side spot on. That's I've saying, American revolutionary war actually conservative movement. Using CDC values IFR age (scenario 5, current best estimate) 2019 census values population age gives following estimated deaths 100 percent infection rate:

Age 0-19: 81.6M x 0.00003 = 2,449 dead

Age 20-49: 126.6M x 0.0002 = 25,926 dead

Age 50-69: 80.38M x 0.005 = 401,903 dead

Age 70+: 36.6M x 0.054 = 1,976,576 dead

Total: 2,406,854 dead

Population IFR=0.0073 =0.73%

If IFR numbers accurate, 209k covid deaths implies around 28.4 million people already infected. (It's bit higher now, numbers couple weeks ago) okay, already short flu shots year, waiting get shots two daughters 2 weeks I’m serious football fan feel like team performance college professional level suffering physical mental fog. would interesting obscure sports/computer junkie see correlation infection athleticism. No. not. huge fan time jumped ship. Also Trump definitely Hannity. thread comments hilarious Right. People making mistake Barrington Declaration, suggests implementing widespread federal programs nobody ""open up"" crowd throwing support behind. 

Nobody scientific credibility backing ""open feel like"" plan skeptics nearly universally pushing. fact plans include modicum reduced restrictions, skeptics' warped self delusions, validates view thats credible minds. Min. Wage like $8.25? can't find workers. much construction going jobs can't fill retail fast food. watch help wanted boards able bodied 18 year old says looking work, 50+ offers, real offers much better fast food. worry many young people going construction related jobs stopping college dropping part time construction dries (I would say 5 years away least, can't go forever due lack usable land lack water?) might sorry degree guess save could go back school? relate this, phone number 8 years now. month tracing began started get phone calls banks, tax office... places Indian operators tell problem.  3d printer recommend mask design thingiverse. uses disc mask tissue replaceable filter. Yes! totally agree
I've always hated needles shots well getting blood drawn, good actually got flu vaccine nasal spray (and started going minute clinic vaccines there).

I've spoken doctor well one two others general census I've gotten nasal flu vaccine affective ages, shot affective others. 
I done much research though. may gone, it’s going disappear like magic day now!!! full shit. Next? social Darwinist tinfoil hat. Nothing more. Kindly eat whole ass.   related lack domestic PPE production now? immediately obvious Fauci couldn’t referring Trump. said, it’s incredibly dishonest Trump. expect lies exaggerations election season, beyond that. Networks refuse run ad. state? cities particular? ""You cannot reason people positions didn’t reason into"" Ummm bc US federal government run racist hamsters. lots money, trust him. go mate, nonpaywalled noncookiewalled full Who? want totalitarian police state? That’s depressing. It’s really sad see easily people willing give basic freedoms. Though I’m sure either troll Russian bot something. moved April, joined. imagine, however, cleaner based condition facility otherwise. still seems safer grocery store, go grateful it. well stupid anything get infected based 1% mortality rate least come higher collective IQ. maybe stop making reality shows. Read key, green arrow better staying same.

[Look 7, 14 30 day averages deaths here, getting 10 states keep bringing either showing current death rate instead got hit early virus lots deaths, like NY, they're smaller states less newsworthy, like Mississippi. It’s flu bro 
It doesn’t affect young people 
What family? Don’t worry won’t get infected 



And favorite recents: 
“Don’t let covid control you”

Original meaning go social distancing rules fight disease won’t cripple us, people interpreted it? fuck want:.. eat delivery

Right. people working jobs risk getting sick sit home. wash N95 masks? sanitize them? Ahem....America Downvote click-bait. permanent change work home routine, hopefully reduce car emissions imo. Gotcha. ""Warbarglarg"". that's no. collecting data pubs restaurants help fulfil contact-tracing duties harvesting confidential customer information experts warned “privacy crisis” caused rise companies exploiting QR barcodes take names, addresses, telephone numbers email details, passing marketers, credit companies insurance “quick response” mobile codes widely adopted hospitality, leisure beauty industries alternative pen-and-paper visitor logs since government ordered businesses collect contact details give NHS Test Trace data collected kept business 21 days must used “for purposes NHS Test Trace

Here rest nonpaywalled full Plus universal healthcare. Wtf u talking  feel like personal vendetta reason Technically, know. Chump seems always find way. Check peer-reviewed, published study covid victims’ inner ears, “caught virus action.” point exact line reasoning applied aerosol (not droplet) spread. know virus hang air infected person left, every major study I've seen often self-admitted limitations friendly lab conditions, problems Independent Action Hypothesis, and/or claims conclusions whether identified virus would enough likelihood actually infecting somebody. forgot add part people dying n about. without lockdown person saying CDC full shit sheep? lol k. 

I wish could instill empathy people. aging population, check Japan also perspective. I'm flexing anything, head, saw 3 highly downvoted comments thread KNEW would say, almost verbatim, opening them. Right, better let run rampant population killing people shaking foundation economy instead. /s guess would like transparency *why* believe statements make.

I see point making wrong predictions. However, personally would feel comfortable experts trying transparent making predictions, also walking assumptions lead answer. 

Similar kid math test wanted us “explain work”. Even final answer wrong, evaluator look got final answer. 

Social distancing 2022? Why? vaccine effectiveness? Vaccine roll out? Rapid testing? Even prediction wrong, assumptions explanation important final date. European countries considered another lockdown. Trump entire medical community wrapped around finger doctor saying something even remotely positive blackmailed them

If they're WH military doctors like WR they're directly underneath chain command they're obligation tell public anything they're told say.

That's different entire medical community still significant here. There's need Trump blackmail anyone whose job includes following orders. like China?

 New Zealand?

And Vietnam? 

And Thailand? 

Why would make way insteadnof implementing testing, tracing, distributing PPE, etc.?

No one saying sit thumbs ass anything. Around 1/4 flemmish voters want seperate Wallonia. Flanders love canadians. Also think small majority assholes it. It’s important look numbers longer period time 7 day rolling average. lot factors could cause uptick case 1 day next labs processing uploading results simply someone waiting take test. I’d love see lower positive cases news article larger increase decrease cases scientific. week plus ago 738 cases one day. Thinking “defeated” virus based upon one day silly thinking one higher day degree high statistical significance. cant Neither France. Czech republic ""8,618 cases recorded Friday country 10.7 million"". equivalent 281,897 cases country size USA, double figures France. Haha maybe trust Fauci heart, seem kind ridiculous crap. like 2020's barely decade. plan, back-up plan fails. plan continuous high testing levels, strictly controlled border good contact tracing quickly shut cases slip border. 5 border breaches shut quick contact tracing isolation close contacts govt run quarantine facilities. 1 case slipped through, escaped testing marginalised community required new lockdown single city 2 weeks already spread far instantly shut down. 

Now even better contact tracing widespread testing even less likely happen again. I’m calm Kavanaugh SCOTUS hearing. person actually skeptic troll posts alarmist crap people like point say, ""Look crazy people here!"" post comments like crazy sub is. intentional whataboutism give skeptics platform spread disinformation. He's borne ilk fallen con. support military police, also hate paying taxes. people. misinformation bad ill informed tbh bigger problem idiot consume information 

they dont bother find trurth see something believe something conflicts question validity new instead figuring fake not

aka lazy I'm *very* pro Fauci. He's impeccably honest. wonder Chump fired yet. still disgusting despite topic conversation. kind sucks takes people going hardship, learn toempathize, least sympathize others. Like like breathing? Okay, pro mask, anti large events indoors!

&amp;#x200B;

One ladies Lupus catch Covid19. 10 weeks later still fighting. mom 2 biologically, cares many neighborhood. life matters many people. Unfortunately, doesn’t really work. soon lockdown lifted, cases go right back again. basically decimate economy need stay locked there’s vaccine work. like 5 months lockdown

Gonna need source that. AFAIK period 3 weeks restrictions usual. Wuhan 2 half months lockdown. 140.000 deaths 150 mio people Another lockdown (even govetnms call something else) seems likely European countries. 7 day average site says Florida better. I’m curious states worse Florida never mentioned?

If Florida bad got nonstop coverage sub isn’t coverage states? Good. Human rights matter. surely wouldn’t worked though let’s real here, two months would right back way two months. sure? Damn. one affirmative u/monnii99 vote away enacting :( Cries Melbourne Lol wut? wants things stay way forever it’s first time feels morally superior hiding mom’s basement social life instead shame peer-reviewed publications? Consult therapist address callousness one million dead victims bud.

And please note intelligence linked greater concern following covid public health guidance. almost 6 months.  


Either herd immunity lost it.

Or close herd immunity suggested long way go. 

&amp;#x200B;

All signs point ""we're fucked"". Winter coming going happens Meat Packing plants cold environments, going spread easily. still think weather plays important part even though still able spread summer too. think spread even easily winter. Tell Sweden, don’t even wear masks public transport people care others, even think them. ""my freedoms."" Everybody concerned trivial things complain show ""freedom"" taken away others even come question. idea ""freedom"" gone completely fucking rails. others ""freedom"" worry dying dipshit can't wear tiny mask thirty minutes he's grocery store? goes right back ""me vs them"" mentality - people view others, especially others disagree think/believe differently - genuinely lesser them.

There thought process of, ""am causing harm others?"" ""others"" matter. matter, they'd feel me. mattered, they'd believe - anybody enemy. People think way think living, breathing people different views - they're enemy, they're actively attacking way life, actively taking away freedoms, another example that.

It's dangerous fuck set us back least generation terms stand society terms empathy, equality, acceptance, overall decency.

When kid, family friend called ""Papa"" looked sort grandpa. racist, decent enough try hide although slipped times. remember thankful - genuinely thankful, like age 9 - time grew up, ""all people like would gone."" foreign ancient concept hate somebody based look feel think. consider be"" racist"" ""very accepting"" anything, normal, people people people different that's okay. way hate would continue, way people growing growing could still feel way. Boy fucking wrong. ""Potential"" - key word. Let's assume true. Ehhh...Tribalism politics definitely rose then. also civil rights movement sexual liberation much since too. Don’t disagree. Starting Karen Brighton. shouldn’t “gotcha”. someone truly believes idiotic notion leaders criminal prosecuted COVID response, consistent would hold accountable (which would evidently every single leader entire world). don’t, rhetoric politicians like DeSantis Trump, I’m pointing hypocrisy bias, dangerous thing pandemic. Shhhh don’t want hear lockdown overreaction  way American guy did. Wow really kind you. actually got respirator back January alright truly appreciate it. kinda stuff rarer gold. 

I try argue get sick health care workers use bunch masks kinds resources worth couple grand scheme things.

Stay safe condition, good luck. can't produce quote assumptions opinions.

So think Fauci thinks risk high enough completely avoid trains, planes, etc, despite masks social distancing, Trump? would inconsistent him. afraid getting Covid, clearly thinks could die get ill. act way thought would sniffles couple days like do. 

If want provide quote Fauci saying ""TRUMP DEAD"" know Fauci works. master implication without actually saying something definitive held account to. obviously Fauci sees Trump even higher risk himself, due Trump's excessive weight, exposure, etc. reality far Fauci thought would regards Trump's illness. According Fauci's reasoning, Trump ill point. one question understand position. COVID sick binary you- someone either dies fine- between?

It depends many factors like age, weight, comorbidities, exposure, etc. Upwards 99.9% mild illness asymptomatic. small percentage, mostly 80 years age higher risk. Well that, potential long term issues younger less vulnerable. Bad leadership means people unnecessarily die. super true Holy shit, insane. Stick TYT bc working you..... Come think it, they're probably reason can't comprehend simple thing. 10? would make sense Yeah that’s every night, pandemic not. 🤣 forget make twice dramatic, boring. sql it’s easy dedupe... getting stuff organized enough go compatible data structure hard af. 😂. one dumbest comments I've ever seen reddit. Nah it’s corruption stupid people American. China 31 different provinces, comparable number countries Europe. put limits travel provinces, eradicated virus everywhere.

When China opened daily life (schools institutions gyms on, non-essential stuff), inter province travel, view keep infected count 0. 

If infections city China today, lock city test 4 million inhabitants 3 days. 

In Europe, began open schools summer, tolerated cases there, using targeted school closings half-assed contact tracing. 

And see result approach. full-blown second wave.

Europe could easily done China, Europe chose eradicate virus because... knows. entirely possible China. Wilson literally part Progressive Era. presidency progressive us history FDR. people ate completely ignorant history. Yup. terms technology sure, terms politics society general downhill. ok.. disagree voting trump well watch 3 week.. hell remind me.. Right, terrorist attacks big deal people killed them. Makes sense. Fauci would’ve fired months ago possible. kill quickly oxygen levels drop. beginning pandemic doctors surprised “happy hypoxics” patients could talk seem fine,  low oxygen levels. might felt fine couldn’t breathe. speculating.

Recently scientists found virus impact pain receptors way patients might feel pain. Sometime patients feel better first reduced pain levels. You’re right it’s like common cold. Literally common cold includes corona viruses. COVID 19 mild cold. news around sensationalized it’s ridiculous. get elected first place? gave away free bear. you’d get one one. world: fine run we'll buy china

China: OH SHIT BAD BUY HOARD THINGS Fauci ever addressed studies say masks don’t work?

Or better yet addressed comments February said don’t work? Yikes! That's lot cases. Looks like things getting pretty bad! inherited memory inherited sense greatness problem imo. I've always tried say conservative family members mirrored events depression treated climate change new threat par WWII could implement socialist programs maintain republic get rich whole new industry sure joking not. Incase not, would COVID19 related deaths, related activity motorsport. Don’t want wear mask? Stay public areas.

Nah, I'll fine. thanks anyways. 
 
/Swede Ah, yeah, feel immunocompromised person. Wear shield plus kn95, makes big difference risk getting sick. need website kn95s, lemme know. two days could late. probably will. Numbers aint gonna drop gov almost certainly homejail asses. going anywhere good month so. always imagined people would anything save lives. Wearing mask easy. can't imagine someone would make bad wear one. Like really? much want willing bet people wear masks, wear scarf winter complain one bit. Terrorist attack very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, etc etc etc minor part world barely effected anyone compared world's population vs pandemic covering entire world effects everyone. I'm sure dumb enough understand assuming already. Like, seriously stupid thing I've read month. 😂🤣 good luck man! Playing victim good luck. know groups/communities stopping people realising that? Evangelical Christians. believe preachers/ministers else. Religion OG echochamber. Theologians joke all: Cult + Time = Religion thing said Oxford vaccine, never so.

No, can't be. Oxford trial proceeding deliberate pace transparent conditions. people trial developed transverse myelitis. public knows because. . . actual concern safety who've taken vaccine. There's accountability, too. get vibe Chinese efforts, rushed development/deployment resisted attempts get operate transparent manner.

There's Chinese equivalent letter doctors urging federal vaccine development efforts hundred Chinese doctors questioning pace government's vaccine program would hundred doctors jail. Im wearing Piggly Wiggly tshirt. case, hasn’t responded treatment seems permanent. patients regained degree hearing steroid therapy it’s modest improvement. tough positive tests quite stigmatizing people treat test positive much worse. better know instead center gossip treated pariah. obviously leads spread. trump christie survive, mother nature probably, hopefully, summon comet. even collectivist mind set. need get people understand risk management get stop putting petty political games survival.

Education leadership two things lacking. like add living post morality society U.S., subjective. counting Sturgis infections though? kids same. landing office job, shit flows office like wildfire. joke every autumn office sounds like infirmary coughing. That's fascinating stat, saying someone exclusively got around motorcycle (no car) almost year.

And compared 2019 numbers, covid 3rd leading cause death USA  I'm surprised gotten suicided yet much contradicts Trump help us safe. deserves lot respect.  difference far loss life ability prevent it? original goal flatten curve. going part life.  America literally generous county Drats, foiled again! Man, *went moon* cold war though! Like launched whole era space exploration.

I'd say US fucked lot stuff WWII. Great Depression, Dust Bowl, Prohibition. victories course; abolishing slavery, women's suffrage, industrial revolution, seems like made LOT progress country cold war; civil rights, dawn computerization information age, public safety environmental regulations, letting disco die... Really big picture stuff affects almost every aspect lives today. Global Study Hospitalized Patients Confirms shit human half fucking Brain understood first fucking place. Uh, said multiple times given agree. what's point bringing people them? distraction. way say ""gotcha."" Clearly proof number illegals America \s trending! I'm ready leave US. May live you? lol hell headline. parents non stop decades decades. mad Fox News. supplying propaganda. want scare you, Spain, pandemic stopped country months, average population infected 2-5% state level handful smaller populations (10-20k cities, especially ones near Madrid) 10-20%. Herd immunity going save us (the reinfection debate still settled) without taking years. best way beat getting it. Phuck Fauci that’s true lot understanding people still quarantining feel instead hateful rude history clearly shows. sound like edgy angsty teenager. Hopefully grow one day wise world. permanent deafness temporary It’s shame way enlighten morons dumb realize stupid 

Don't make mistake. specifically able enlighten anything want.

If Fox Entertainment, Britbart, OAN, etc. wanted wear masks, would wearing masks. think end WWII high water mark. America coasted 50s accomplishments past cold war one long spiral bottom. right me. That's people previous fields (statisticians actuaries) define/use term ""average."" know widespread among laymen (or possibly fields) ""average"" defined *only* arithmetic mean.  faith, need proof. Kind definition faith, believing without evidence. he's also literally lied literally every literal thing friend Thailand, can't get back Australia :( apart that, job still going, he's got much lower cost living and, say, Thailand basically ticking along. Vietnam, too, accounts. almost collectivist mindset better us species long run....

The thing sticks harder mind passing month idea pandemics happen result economic, social cultural situations. Spanish Flu would happened without end WWI diaspora servicemen homes world, taking disease them.

Coronavirus would happened without constant underfunding education system last 40 years, distrust science scientists, politicians using wedge politics gain maintain power, constant tilt politically towards rampant individualism. 

You end situation people educated enough decide true lies; even probably improbable. refusal listen experts spent whole lives working field. complete lack empathy others, thinking money given help others coming directly pocket. refusal what's best others, even inconveniences extremely mildly ie: wearing mask.

That's drag on. can't undo society-wide attitudes built decades matter months, even years. 

I'd willing bet large amount money *if* vaccine found, available eye-watering prices, stuff given vulnerable front-line workers quietly forgotten, favour people afford it. It’s daily life. socialize responsibly. Everything you’re responsible, adhering guidelines, necessary, encouraging spread. quote says available beds assuming rest already filled. guess catch find out. not, unfortunately enough nobody healthcare getting without chip shoulder. actively hype morning working EMS remember express empathy done people am. I've cut everyone life thinks bullshit, I've spent first half year plastic Tyvek haz suits going scenes even wear gown I've given up. kills least bullshit me, worst left absolute lack affection compassion anyone thinks fake.  message. 

Good, want ignorant, wear mask call hoax God-president brainwashed fine. us healthcare favor. Commit ignorance, stand statements. get sick, go Dr., go ED, call 911. guys know everything anyway, doctor tell already know? Stay home, either live like super human imagine be, find wrong die. waste resources people take seriously need, die home preferably alone bring anyone else you. appreciate gesture. cure him, never it. removed Whitehouse everyone sick. right tells dumb is. 

like right tells us dumb are? Like that? keep telling people: nothing else want avoid medical debt! It’s expensive sick US. I'm at-risk :/ Extremely dumb. Look scientists doctors respect opinion pfft Like cancer patients cowering behind chemotherapy? Putain est dans la merde Oh heard? Apparently China's fault. Contained word looking for. Vietnam, Taiwan, NZ several countries essentially done it. possible things get control North America Europe around mid-2021 fall winter looking pretty rough. sweating, champ I'm glad we're stage 5 go restaurants bars again! (/s, obviously) Lets deport everyone infected China “Dr. Anthony Fauci said Thursday even effective Covid-19 vaccine replace need public health measures, wearing mask, social distancing washing hands.

Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said vaccine 100% effective taken 100% population -- means still room Covid-19 spread.

Fauci said he's ""practical"" says, ""I think get 75 80% population vaccinated, think would really good accomplishment.""

Here’s another one downvote stick head sand about. Exactly. Percentage wise, there's really many attractive people world either, even though I'd bet lot anti-maskers think they're pretty cover face. Shit really going crazy 30 days now! I'm honestly scared, 27k new cases france alone Mothers Little Helper song Stones describing medication housewives “olden” days helped cope stresses housewife Alot political, would cost money large corporations, WH play mask mostly unnecessary angle. WH stopped CDC safety requirement mask wearing public transport, trashed plan USPS send masks every household country. Mask wearing seen offensive political stunt conservatives prudent safety measure scientifically valid. way avoid politics comes covid, got booted coronavirusUS sub comments like this. tell people they're afraid of. I'm *afraid* covid-19 I'll likely survive it. fact think already earlier year. 

I take precautions people. too. difficult either—it's totally within ability. Try good member society look what's best everyone. letter called “The Stanford Conspiracy”. behind 90% bullshit since March. Hockey rinks cold, ideal environments virus. like meat packing plants: virus die quickly. least one person came said referees wearing face coverings, which, unfortunately, prolonged contact not, increases risk transmission.

Luckily, kids wear full face shields games now, positive tests yet league. players also remain quarantine 9 days, even negative tests, reduce risk spread case one test positive later. taking threat seriously better safe sorry approach can’t read decision would made, oh enlightened one? Given two shitty choices, give masks medical professionals need care wave sick people save lives *or* give people go run weekly errands? 1.35MM people die annually car accidents world wide 8th leading cause death. 

37k die annually another 2 million injured US alone. 

I don’t see anyone rushing ban cars. 

Why ok people die car accidents coronavirus? one, accept it, entire world come grinding halt. see hypocrisy? think mean herd mentality FORSYTHIA - still hear jude law saying Well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Shit. hilariously ignorant stupid. really need grow What!? selling!? evidence worse timeline although convinced trump won. Maybe try source credibility.

Why would expert bother addressing complete crackpot nonsense is. You’re concerned shutdowns masks, you’re trying being. vaccine 50-70 percent immunity, like flu shot-we still going depend measures while. Sorry. paying 3000$ quarantine too. government stopped paying quarantine long ago. great great! Uhhh trump trouble going small ramp. I'm surprised he's tired 2 flights stairs lol Apparently can’t make comment politics comment says something politics, fuck mods. Vitamin deficiency relatively prevalent across northern countries it’s important piece information carry forward reducing population-level impact COVID infections. sure dexamethasone severe patients suffering cytokine storm anything information correct not? 

Also sure split replies 3 different parts last part immunity emergency, certainly is. guiding principles immunity virus eventually help policy makers choose course action, whether direct population towards learning live virus continue non-medical interventions since long-lasting immunity eventually provide end impact waves infections. 

There’s long world continue social distancing, knowing vaccines likely induce sort least protective immunity incredibly important making decisions move forward. whole pandemic emergency overall, people losing homes jobs there’s much debt issued following MMT means economically restrictive tax policy future. says incapable altering opinions behaviors new information. chuds keep trying rally around hold water. actually completely pathetic sound sane rational. completely unamerican you. Ahhh okay, makes lot sense. Still worrying residents state, obviously. also killed thousands let's avoid bad narrative almost like SARS-COV-2 influenza viruses, rather causes disease closely related Corona type virus. I've never surprised type customer unwilling wear mask. ever actually ask one leave, always storm frustration making clear ""Masks Required"" sign sign door.

I work small bike shop Az customers gotten program every day there's least 2 3. Today, customer try brush insistence wear mask, pull mask pocket, put chin - though appropriate way wear it. left frustration insisted wear mask appropriately, mouth nose.

I genuinely hate laying law store policy, literally law, happens also right thing god damned global pandemic. can't fix bikes get sick we're already slammed 5 days week even though can't get new bikes parts getting hard source.

Wearing mask keeping back best literally least customer. can't bothered minimum, probably want business first place. Venn diagram customers pain ass people refuse wear mask nearly perfect circle. Good riddance. Obviously education knowledge expect church? coming school nurse, I’m assuming hippa might play since decisions based symptoms/medical info. Either way, I’m custodian don’t give shit it’s Timmy Susie covid, rather it’s covid not. right fucking call. Knowing government completely ill prepared handle pandemic, last thing needed millions dumb Americans panic buy remaining n95 masks shelves could wear grocery store every two weeks. right decision probably saved thousands lives. Yep, I’m xennial. literally look different mask mandates shut downs done across globe statistics literally show stronger mask mandates shut downs significantly reduced total amount deaths per million.

South korea, Japan, even vietnam come practically unscathed compared america.  think culture legitimate reason wrong thing think culture lock family closeness. family close - cultural reason. seen Dad twice (wearing masks, social distancing worst part -no touching!-) children SO's. hard, sad difficult. accept Covid reality must defeat it. put number perspective, that’s 33 times people died holocaust. EDIT: oops replied wrong comment. Classic projection. go since mask mandate.  sense you’re clearly ignorant topic, probably aren’t familiar outside what’s posted sub.

I’m still confident normalcy mid spring, hope we’re busy spending time family friends point respond thread lol work hotel. Unfortunately, owners desperate guests don’t want enforce mask mandate (state, city franchise). I, however, treat entirely different stand front without mask, someone comes behind one on, extra cheery them, know different service got was. I’m sure light bulb won’t go dim heads tells it’s disrespected guests, hope. Sorry, sorry. Problem law medical professionals supersede politicians enacted, cronies would “medical professionals” sudden wont know til years road percentage people suffer long term effects. Dumb question  guess GenX. Born 78. 

Feels like 1878 compared toy kids though. Domestic imported ones noticing this?!!! good news welcome thoughtful reply upvoted. think post propaganda. literally to. science showing masks work right now. He's pointing idiots real life anecdote correlates known science literally have. 

You guys ones wont accept science stop acting like giving matters. piece polyester cloth around mouth picture worthless . country besides China went full Wuhan would probably riots think proven, been.

But people meet wear masks, latch misleading information; right now, coronavirus smaller holes cloth masks, therefore masks anything.

When reality, coronavirus going attached aerosolized water particles air, 100% impeded mask. understanding ""millenials"" would group teens early adulthood turn millennium. 1980 good cutoff. oldest millenials turning 40 year. almost certainly less 1% fatal. 

The rolling 7 day average hit estimated 0.14% Even good news depressing taste too! spent much money Christmas Island detention centre. mention first set repatriates Wuhan quarantined (way back feb I’m wrong). what’s holding back increasing capacity repatriations. find well structured preprint thorough analysis antibody cellular response across various stages clinical deterioration. Seeing it’s preprint don’t need believe I’m telling you, want show I’m spreading completely unfounded misinformation. 

I would like see paper interference immunologic memory. saw something similar lot people skeptical seeing memory B-cells present vast majority recovered patients, paper analytical rather trial/study based. sure we’re talking one here. point COVID least 2X deadly flu....try keep data far indicate crude mortality ratio (the number reported deaths divided reported cases) 3-4%, infection mortality rate (the number reported deaths divided number infections) lower. seasonal influenza, mortality usually well 0.1% Republicans Trump stupid look best interests. ashamed country. 4 years bullshit! climax.... Fair yes. Bill belichick knew every play call. Ah survive important part. possible thousands medical bills long term side effects prevent basic tasks ease. don’t matter all. point, advocate chopping hand? Pretty sure right survival rate around 99%  science works. control group (Trump friends) exact things test group. class things. part tests involve large numbers, myriad tiny differences balance out.

If case, exactly think test things like vaccines?

(This still good test due small numbers, something tells Dr. Fauci trying make political statement convince people safe instead preparing paper scientific journal.) wouldn’t die virus first place Trump also proved democracy dying, else new

Biggest dummy world actually made *masks* political... imagine wheeled surgery told staff wearing masks due bullshit opinions? Oh mild typo! hope never find repeat word typos exist almost great literary works. incorrect. massive releases VWF extremely high ddimer. oxidative stress much comorbidities. way outside way influenza functions. many people know this.  many sources. It’s hypothesis point article says ‘may source’ doesn’t make fact. Good read though. Thank you. realize knowing vs blatantly lying lacked supply masks? call Fauci every article blame him. Wear mask protection even care other's health. Protect health self care live see normality return.

Why risk stupid reason lazy adhere best health practices present?

Stay safe everyone! want Covid win! Wear mask! right now: Millennial 1981 1996. Makes sense. One would assume millennial would person born near millennium lol

Edited add argue years, they're one two years. 3 asymptomatics confirmed Qingdao. chiming say kids rock depressing many people learning can't around kids extended periods time Also vitamin you’re deficient, experts said. steroids severe patients. information you’re spouting accurate it’s important discuss inflate evidence, lack of. that's true, get healed flu 3 days like Trump got healed corona Literally party wears masks gotten infections party crowds tight spaces tons. 

He's using anecdote guys literally denying well known science masks work. China dealt pandemic wonderfully returned normal life within half year. Everyone else...

Second wave! Exploding Vaccine half year away. people even able get quick enough. Economy DEAD.

Here USA still lying HOAX ask back March ever see North Dakota COVID hotspot. Dear Lord!  Back 2009 H1N1 hit immune system hard enough let 2nd infection run amok ears. I'm partially deaf it. 

Just virus doesnt kill mean wont leave maimed scared life. Xennails thing: Canada needs test more. aARE U SHEEP LION? FACEBOOK SAY LION BCUZ WEAR MASK LIKE FRENDS. crazy I've heard people back states throat swabs commonly used now, nasal swabs like ones typically used PCR tests accurate. comes immunity, there’s emergency. need solid data. point putting people it’s factual settled. It’s not. Deniers explain away 2M deaths somehow

Can't take time worry *people* dying *business* might die cause somebody lose money. mean, talking about? amazes past flu killed tens millions well new. really terrible comparison make. wonder heart scans get better time shown permanent point... think licking boots cure COVID. live Queensland, another area that’s well coronavirus. don’t know anyone who’s even cold year since lockdowns. Right back you, slim. Careful, that's almost political comment - mods remove comment lock thread points relate illness medical issue though. That’s averages. US needs vaccines home. probably surplus export mid-2021 earliest.

It also seems like PR risk promise gifts novel mRNA vaccines convincing evidence (i.e. Phase 3) whether work. zoomers need safe space. Damn lot, scaredy cats. Even boomers shit scared least valid reason avoid catching flu didnt lack laws. blew didnt see danger seem uninformed. Government mandated masks drop cases dramatically. Since Republicans politicized mask wearing (for reason...), vote Democrat. initially unable ban visitation rights early pandemic. Hence high death rate nursing homes. incorrect? Sounds like Matrix Sure, take 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg, ¼ teaspoon ground ginger, ⅛ teaspoon ground cloves got perfectly safe oral vaccine*.

^^*Vaccination ^^protects ^^against ^^being ^^dangerously ^^low ^^on ^^pumpkin-spice. Keep mind differs based age health individual

Yea, 100 times less young reasonably healthy. could easily done China, Europe chose eradicate virus because... knows.

Europe chooses human rights utmost importance. People deserve basic human right freedom infect other, loved ones, family, friends etc. human right choose deaths infections something respected costs. Human rights. At. All. Costs. months ban nursing home visits, lifted days ago. There's reason monks tend celibate. Human life competing sexual advantage, competing offspring advantage dominate others' offspring. fundamental core socialization, romance, family competition exploitation. odd miracle enlightened sense we've developed right wrong somehow perceives barbarism cruelty emphasizes equality, etc.

Another way think anyone preaches equity, engages polyamory, hypocrite. million examples like that.

But, humanity exploitation, there's answer. got far people lost, killed exploited, others won. reason mods remove ""political"" posts comments here. igorbnews.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah admit dont want like China It’s tip spear comes inequality society, it’s solid example come rest country. 

As California goes, goes nation, right? One time 😜 tweeter die falling bed care long happens prison. Still debating whether wear mask literally 9 months start pandemic nothing liberty federalism. plain dumbarsary Fourth Reich upvoted this? whoever asshole, straight up. point anecdotal examples examples give different conclusion. point show examples conclusive proving mask usage defining factor fighting pandemic. read article, mask usage went shitton places people meet got shut well around time. would say much important. see people tend think ""we wear mask stand close together"" course, thats true. Press alt+f4 i'm Ontario, that's data i'm familiar with.

65% deaths long term care facilities (1961 3004)

69% deaths 80 years old older (2,067 3004)

86% deaths 70 years old older (2,596 talking k-12 schools Oregon? list counties in-person schooling? thought requiring masks also surprised me. mid September Fourth Reich. Adolph would jealous Asian culture thing?

I know Japan, embedded cultural traditions abotu disease. habits predate science, endured survived introduction scientific education. Basically, Japanese traditional culture handles disease like big invisible perplexing unpreventable mystery. that, people come disease considered either bad people must deserved it, traitors polite society gall become sick. brutally stigmatize persecute illness. people suffering radiation disease atom bomb. No, didn't, ""have uncertainty whether might contagious."" knee-jerk Japan cruel suffer illness. part social glue conformity, people stupidly romanticize ""cooperation"". I'm sure. new virus comes similar deadlier, expect non-morons social distance hardcore known corona morons. expect lots QoL changes business, social constructs governmental response well, f.e. availability prices grocery ordering services, spread containment measures acceptance within population, etc. countries used epidemic outbreaks tend get better response every time different layers community.

You'll never know crazy politics places like US Brazil general, think Corona we've got 1-generation buffer zone people get dumb lol.

half population suddenly basically epidemiological expertise sophomore haha Sweden failed protect elderly nursing homes lacked laws allowed government prevent people visiting aging relatives. knew that...whats pointless studies? 70 percent chance providing immunity person aka develop enough antibodies stop infection thus spreading becoming I'll. Sometimes flu vaccine work people may develop mild symptoms. sure would fall effective category not. deaths 1 serious illness. 

3 serious illness events upon reinfection. like coronaviruses seems long lasting protective immunity little sterilizing immunity.

If long lasting protective immunity, expect serious illness occur upon re-exposure (or increased symptoms occurred 50% secondary exposure cases known outcomes). discount reality willful fear, pretending despite evidence reinfection worrying all.

Seems like trying make reality rather acknowledge what's actually going patients. so-called ""protective immunity"" 50% reinfections (with known outcomes) result severe symptoms first exposure? Honest question, differences treatment now? funniest thing Americans might  realize EVERYWHERE ELSE western planet copycatting political views virus.

Take Bolsonaro example , saying takes ""hydroxicloroquine himself"" Trump said it. right-wing anti-masks movements around world repeating exact discourse republicans America.

IMHO way embarrassing anything  think , history class 2040, teacher explain students entire societies followed steps republicans democrats instead following scientific advice criteria , I'll feel embarrassed society fellow citizens. light thing. swear remember plot line Star Trek TOS. refuse test, forced get one. However, might justified quarantine tested positive, make wait two weeks supervised isolation unless agree test. people applied logic religion?

""I know anyone seen God eyes."" Sweden decided way went successful, that’s they’re changing policies like neighboring countries. Test results transmitted HL7 v2.

That's 400,000 sets HL7 code `MSH|^^^^^...`, `MSH|^^^^^...`, `MSH|^^^^^...`, `MSH|^^^^^...`, data reaches database.

Cross figures pray there's social security number inside PID-3 field, spend rest day trying see 15000 John Smiths California one needs notified critical medical condition ASAP.

Also result re-sent, might same. newer result might fields old one. multiple things tested, might originally sent separate results, re-send would combined message.

""Results ready tomorrow"" probably means there's guy who's going work 2:00 nervously drinking 10 cups coffee computer data correct-ish database. He'll wake exhausted tomorrow, assistant manager yell 10 minutes late, tired properly explain boss's boss lab result data took long fix. problem saying protesting allowed leads massive slippery slope far freedom speech concerned. opens massive legal liability government. Otherwise, would agree mass protests discouraged pandemic.

However, allowed allowed do. *should not* do, given evidence provided us far transmissibility virus concerned terms different conditions human behaviours. went ~270,000 infected March 3,000 end June. absolutely work great cost everyone's mental health, public health sports shut increase ~8% national debt. changed lot pains say now.m 12 months since even visited. grew south bay different.

What emotion proud roots yet also pissed become/ foreigner it? need ban international travel like NZ.

That's key. Dutch healthcare nationalised. know slowing spread MS (she 50s, family friend) feel like might worth it. One way think COVID highly supercharged flu. bad rare flu case body get messed up. COVID like that, except instead exceptionally rare, bad outcomes merely less likely. 

Sorry, care 99% chance I'll recover. 1% chance losing hearing, sense smell, fatigued years? thanks. figure out.

Until - forget vaccines - figure something like ""if clinical progression COVID going XYZ direction, treat QRS prevent sideways permanent outcomes"". also requires rapid available testing get diagnosed treated time.

Until that's place, naw, I'm going ""just live life"" return movie theaters etc. I'm surprised Italy bad, worse Sweden? many businesses closed forever? many jobs gone forever? many people experiencing mental health issues result government's efforts save sick 80 year olds? 

Different metrics. CDC said 2018 masks useless flu. Well sucks fit US numbers still going up, flu season hits... right, im lucky wife secure work quarantine. know lot people lost livelihoods pandemic rough - problem back 2008-2010 know head.

Unfortunately good way this, seems economy vs lives - make kind choice? don’t think metric shows Sweden better neighbors.

fta: “over past weeks, infections Sweden started rise well. 25 September, FoHM reported 633 new cases nationwide 1 day. Stockholm's rates nearly tripled 2 weeks, 334 second week September 967 last week. Whether immunity making big difference remains seen.

THE SWEDISH EXPERIMENT coming end, policies fall line neighbors. FoHM officials “quietly changing approach,” ... But, mean either variation produces immune response - general - effective protective neutralizing antibodies last longer months. ugh fucking sucks. guess maybe mask growing bacteria wet? saw little boy almost lost eye bacterial infection old water bath toy guess totally outside realm possibility? appreciate everyone jobs dealing stressful situations it, primarily due pandemic. don’t see need put others. Yes jobs visible isn’t. I’m sorry feel do. know appreciate like undervalued. 🙂 can't convince anyone unless want put work return. can't tell situation. ask follow footsteps endangering others. either take risks find way change situation (even leads difficult life decisions). Seriously, Tuesday he's going proclaim ""we're proud grown-up country"" something along terms ""we feel need set strict rules, to"", I'm done. Yes past 7months family 4 isolated due high risk status. urks end kids likely suffer isolation even longer US can't get together. Didn’t completely ravage country whilst nothing even fought restrictions?


Weird thing popular for? order buy time put contact tracing processes, implementing mass testing rapid turnarounds, fine tune isolation processes

Except none garbage actually works? entirely security theater designed make people feel like government taking care them. Nobody actually demonstrated ""contact tracing"" slowing spread country except New Zealand 5 million people isolated island. Europeons able implement successful contact tracing months lockdown police officers tasing wearing mask? Good comment 👍 anyone find 6 months lockdown elderly cruel? 

Germany 6 weeks - re-opened old folks homes early May. worked kept infection numbers society down. man, reality people reddit want right thing. relatively worthless stage anyway nothing tracked traced anymore. Anecdotal evidence reliable method. matter subject talking about. problem religion anecdotal stories thing have. think 5 percent infected. think scientist estimate maximum percent population 85 percent. percent people USA infected goes 5 percent 85 percent, maybe 210,000 dead could increase 3.57 million US. Wow. I’m cynical I’m glad don’t piss poor vision future do. 

And FYI, PPE zealots social distancing “Karens” (WTF even mean anyhow?). REASON PPE social distancing. it’s hardship realize this, stay fuck home. one needs fucked attitude. would happen supermarket probably able contain calm. right, also wrong. better headline would indeed ""what data says"" data treated singular English language. Yeah western world want live like china ""Living Fear"" taking basic, reasonable precautions slightly inconvenience overwhelmingly consumer lifestyle. hope sober one day, read comment months change behaviour 👎😿 Earlier year testing supplies short supply labs oregon sort genetic work stripped PCR supplies (and PPE too) supply hospitals. 

That literally never happened scale whatsoever part country. Fake? think not. comparing new cases PER DAY vs total hospital ICU? nothing comparable cases day might different curve country It’s skeptics.. reality it’s easy enough anyone let guard down.. roll dice discussing Facebook (i Know ir know) point Someone used argument. saying almost one dies covid, issues covid FLU People actually die. findings showing epidemiologists health specialists say process FLU exactly - people die complications diseases already prompted FLU. 
No one REALLY talked FLU ages people know virus kills covid everything new talked un detail. 
Those people 0 research unless conspiracy theory pooulism propaganda page. 
IM actually disgusted.  opposite way around. “Today, European countries less following Swedish model, combined testing, tracing quarantine procedures Germans introduced, none admit it,” said Antoine Flahault, director the Institute Global Health, Geneva. smarter every day this. look smile: think one difficult jobs, largely underpaid understand. short-staffed makes extra difficult. ☹️ 

It seems like care though! good thing! Anyone working long term care facility needs care. Otherwise don’t job disservice people care. 

Try see upside things, matter people care may behave, providing much needed service. something proud of. call Bull... public transport regularly see people wearing masks (even though ""strongly recommended"") shops also maybe 1 20 wearing masks....

Finns taking seriously one really wearing masks.. (except elderly ""foreigners"") Praying work. oh good confused science part fascism better globalism? cata-fucking-strophic. one power right now, gives shit. Knocks minute. Sounds interesting. he's still fat fuck. Where’s data? Let’s see sweden. Otherwise it’s making Alternatively, *reason* cities kept case numbers close zero *because of* bold preemptive lockdowns. 

Better take serious action seen overreacting, enough allow virus reap havoc. beat it, happens next? I'm seeing lot Paris well...also restaurants packed inside. Yes, masks worn outside inside, matter everyone still getting together socialize houses restaurants without masks. Look small business closures. Compare areas lockdowns. 

Lots businesses survive slowdowns economy. many months forced closures. 

All obvious. many currently NZ? 0.4% done, I’m calling Republicans legitimately everything turn WV blue again.  must old numbers, us 653 deaths per million now. (Sweden 578, Italy People say shit like people wear masks socialize large groups. They've literally killed hundreds thousands fellow citizens made U.S. pariah world. 

Don't engage them. Nope. relate. Hate job, yet grateful one. Better get right him. never know time may up. Watch Well yes, worth pointing people still get it. fuck wrong you, type about, upload screenshot imgur something, link it, easy ☹️ 

It shouldn’t way. 100% agree Safe try home? I’m currently recovering COVID-19 luckily case mild. wouldn’t say feels like flu much like pneumonia Shitty data proves survey asked 1.3 million people whether helped stranger donated money time charity recently comment particularly worth responding except want respond actually refute terrible, wrong.

Wear mask. Take seriously. People believe COVID19 serious take precautions living bubble. Economic meltdown? would imagine data patients name, date test, result test easily use keys. simple 30 second query would detect duplicates. One thing sure, people like guy definitely holding back progress. thought everywhere US control! /s KN95, assuming made spec, much better surgical cloth mask, assuming also fitted sealed properly face. Note KN95 indicates made China, US manufactured simply N95s. Note technically respirators, masks. Yes Unless government going start giving us handouts delivering food doors anyone health issues still go work, food, doctors, house items, etc. thus importance eveyrone responsible. prediction US second wave infections positive test results eclipse previous infection rates. not, effect, wane.

As discussed previously. 

Goal post moving thing, pal. School? trump insane say “we look that” 

Fuck hope reach someone, feel wish well. pass!!! LOL, everyone stuck home, staring furniture: ""What shithole, need redecorate!"". disturbed terrible job we've done teaching people safe.

I went got blood drawn day, ask phlebotomist put mask nose. Hibernating sounds like helluva plan RN. timeline reality would ever case. anti-collective, hyper-individualistic society. guess people didn’t like truth? parts SoCal like too. I’ve seen restaurants blatantly ignore indoor dining ban well So, fred trump affair Brazil point?  2 presidents seem like brothers. proceeded plead gun removed head. till next year year western world. Nobody forcing watch Oh fuck.... swine flu worst fever lasted week. can’t imagine anything worse that. Billings. bad here. 100% increase past week alone. science says needed? outbreak office April case, followed last month so. Europe cases now. is/has literally 0 community spread taiwan, everybody wearing masks. even months later now, probably 70% people still wearing masks. life completely normal UV flash light works well heard. Merci! money bought him. Herd immunity going save us (the reinfection debate still settled) without taking years. best way beat getting it.

The virus already control end game herd immunity. Millions cases, tens thousand new every day, strategy stop it.

The question much time then. Hi all, I'm looking specific infographic data set it. 

It ""for every one COVID death, x number hospitalized number going ICU. z cases permanent, life altering effects"" (and breaks type) 

Any idea find that? Never children. think private events one biggest cause. Government orders go far public can’t control happens private property Guess what...i wear gloves get mail...and day husband felt bad mailman bad knees everything delivered...so took package &amp; starts talking &amp; shocked crazy careful (high risk)...my husband comes garage says...""omg, mailman's wife covid, feel bad"". Needless say quite reminder stay awayyyy people ...I think people gave good advice already wanted share...be well~ really think China faked 600 million trips made 20 music festivals fool world?

[In upcoming 8-day Golden week National Day, Chinese music lovers 20 music  It’s selfish take COVID seriously. heart breaks Nurses frontline workers contracting COVID due work cause unnecessary strain due self isolating difficult social implications family dependents. do, welded doors shut, people able leave homes, sprayed streets bleech. stayed locked cases completely stopped. locked cities got cases single digits. can't really compare China's lockdown ours, lockdown capable erraticating virus China's. uh yea? went averaging like 150 deaths/day (v likely take account excess mortality) &lt;10 like 2 months wear mask whenever go out. voting Biden. shouldn’t even preface say two facts, alas, that’s political climate live in: buy right deceive American people masks wouldn’t panic buy supply (let’s ignore part first said science evolved) then, rightfully criticize Trump deceiving American people early months 2020 “because didn’t want panic.” argument entirely flawed. Here’s stance: trust American people truth. don’t, catch lie, won’t trust tell truth. Fauci wrong made mistake masks. advised face coverings warned buying surgical grade equipment. Trump wrong lied. one right lie wasn’t, that’s hypocrisy. read comments article, author gets thoroughly shredded. reproduce pertinent below, Dr Blain White MD:

In part respectfully disagree Derek Lowe’s evaluation here. want make clear fan Mr. Trump strongly support unprecedented editorial action New England Journal Medicine call defeat coming election. substantial evidence HCQ treatment helpful published real world studies series totaling (at least) 27,746 patients from

(1) Henry Ford Hospital Detroit (2,541 patients – Internat J Infectious Diseases 2020; doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.099),

Unfortunately, virus may last thing ever experience. florida like 20,000 excess pneumonia deaths year? prediction cases scale testing much like past 30 days 7 day average deaths remain 800 per day. you? Oh, live it’s pretty much constant ac indoors I’ve never sweat problem. That's whole lot bs. Thanks stopping by. right missing underlying psychology mask issue. It’s even compliance. It’s way react feeling powerless. mask represents — — virus “defeating” then, scares them. exert control seemingly helpless situation, refuse wear mask way controlling seemingly helpless  control world. Irrational yes, seems reason according literature coming psych topic There's also huge lag reporting deaths, half month prior . Life expectancy dropping rapdiy, statement far true end year. Start printing rally tickets! Saskatchewanian here, deaths still low we’re seeing surge cases province. lot new cases can’t traced back anything. Probably month two deaths increase. (AP) — Trump’s doctor says president longer risk transmitting coronavirus.

That's article. Literally, that's entirety it. ""This seatbelt really uncomfortable wrinkles clothes"". (Every adult childhood). Trashing tbe thing saving millions lives. Uh...the Us gonna second wave. 

It’s gonna happen soon.


I dunno, wrong once. I’m curious see think gonna happen next months.

Your call, bruv. Itttttttssssss baaacccccccckkkkkkkk....&lt;— creepy voice Someone described blue island surrounded red sea. OP NYC going really hard time coming winter. work escalations received angry email customer accusing (large) company “UNAMERICAN” strict mask policy protect employees. un-American protect people deadly pandemic wearing square inches fabric? really expected believe this? must think rest world idiots. guess money really buy anything. Definitely. Plus ozone plasma filters kill air. nah great intelligent lockdown. Crushed first wave people still could go outside etc. pretty meh, reactionary slow that. brother says civil war come masks  Someone said Austin like blueberry floating big bowl tomato sauce. voted. I'm glad hear it. Sorry sounding like dick. follow science faith. Science says wear mask, faith mostly says kind other, kindness require faith. don’t actually care anybody closest you.

Well shit, I've living whole life wrong. /s Hang in, do, live moment &amp; well wishes also! utter BS. FAUCI said masks work reversed himself. Claims Protests 100s thousands people streets months cannot spread virus. then, claims 1 small event super spreader. Anyone else half brain? must something else wrong then. never wore mask year, got sick *maybe* year that. Yeah right. went contract work full time gig somehow. I'm grateful starting realize able network going end badly long run. would wear mask sick leave house knew sick people likely flu season. Wal-mart gave lip service wearing masks. encourage wear mask front door; ONE refused entry, ONE asked put mask back inevitably remove mask feet past entrance.

There plenty news stories employees beaten telling customers wear masks, least one murder remember. news stories became popular, national outrage, movement defend employees way whatsoever, accepted new normal. course employees randomly murdered general public, that's life.

The businesses simply decided enforce law protect employees. That's lot cheaper even one wrongful death lawsuit! Yeah should. mask one many enemies:

- Tax loopholes
- Xenophobia 
- Drug abuse
- Mass shootings

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Staying home, wearing mask fascism. nothing inherent coronaviruses makes impossible make vaccine for.

Yes SARS, MERS coronaviruses tested Wuhan laboratory, still one that's shown work, make infection worse.  I'm hearing 50% efficacy less. I'm selfish asshole stating fact? I'm sorry emotionally unstable. almost like something stopped something, started something late avoid carnage.

If understood respiratory diseases spread. saying Republicans learned nothing last hundred years? Sounds right. true! think many friends relying “only old people die” aspect, I’m “the long hauler virus look fun, thanks.” I'm sorry like percentages would instead like pass agenda. problem you, me. good news fix it. Good luck!! Tell what, I'll stop living fear learn periods work. Lombardy 17k deaths 10 million, 0.17%. IFR may vary regions, Italy second oldest population World (after Japan) likely higher IFR country young population bad then... Sry dare people live lives. you’re miserable doesn’t mean others need be. Geography population density Arizona time frame change, can't imagine would impact this. Number coming state... going explain relevant case please back reference. 

You're almost arguing measures without brining reference table opinion. conversation yesterday “friend” proceeded tell figured out. said China created virus germ warfare “thin herd”. also thinks reaction grand scheme things, number deaths isn’t really high. contradictory. People attitude make feel like head explode. don’t agree time energy pick apart try change mind. simply responded work elderly disabled people problem taking precautions protect myself. It’s hard. Compare China's provinces vs European countries then. Even traffic, easier travel from, money coming out... What? familiar term ""high-risk"" means?

Sure, definition: involving exposed high level danger

Now answered question, answer mine? link Fauci said Trump Christie die catch COVID? Sorry, no. I'm going bring mask me. barely encounter anyone runs significantly distance others whenever do. paranoid. use Fauci's standard double blind placebo controlled randomized trials. Apparently study meet standard ""flawed"" use Fauci's term. Citizens shouldn’t rely government mandate restrictions controls. 

Part living “free” society mean acting good faith others. leaders suck? Sure, let’s put blame squarely whee blame belongs. terribly painful, im buddy. struggle daily watch idiots take over. live Phoenix. don’t think attributed masks. timeline doesn’t quite work out. What’s percentage people take needed ICU beds suffer long term effects? measures relevant overall health functioning society. Sick people ultimately survive often taking away resources people suffer cardiac illnesses, cancer etc hospitals getting full, greater consideration extends beyond death count covid. wear schnoz hanging that's 10 per 100k, give take.  cases spike 2 weeks May 18th?

Viruses start increasing cases quickly like that. cases community, even relax *all* social distancing measures, still take exponential increase really kick in.

Remember corona spreading since start year. took late Feb/early March everything kick , that's without measures all. It’s dumb many levels. basic level, firefighters scared fire, otherwise would die stupidity. hurtful part expresses lack empathy really “Let old weak die, I’m selfish can’t sacrifice others, even means wearing piece cloth face minutes!” right indeed older Japan. USA aging nation oldest population earth.  entering second wave restrictions parts Ontario I’m hoping we’ve learned what’s safe isn’t individuals. Live with, despite great take. Containing reduces level cases there’s upswing. refuse accept avoidable deaths vulnerable - end year tally really hit us. said, restrictions cannot force majority independent businesses close forever, without stimulus seriously regulated bar/restaurant rules. government goes back forth restrictions, population get frustrated. major level transparency needed. Oy vey! Jewish man know persecution see it. anyway we'll find soon enough there's lasting natural immunity fair, HIV generally much dangerous one never recover it, unlike Covid-19, healthy people 50 mortality rate similar bad flu. children lower mortality bad flu. Covid-19 certainly deadly sick elderly. think cause big salary. maybe job human beings part limiting spread shit. south later chance build vitamin D. Unless get supplemental vitamin see get winter northern hemisphere. Lots. Of. Periods. Is. Idiotic. Arrogant. and. obnoxious. sayin’.

And election it’s two sides coin - Repugnicans looking destroy republic create fascist regime.  Democrats led around lobbyists. would rather deal fixing broken system rather replacing idiot worships Putin. Checked post history, def idiot. male models?  That's great point too. outbreaks rolling.. really county county, intense others.

What would really good metric have, impossible given state things... current percent people form immunity county. That'd tell us exactly we're at, would take far effort intellect current leadership willing expend. Tonight, hunt. declaration whole bunch nothing. Almost everything solution stated already done (at least province I'm living Canda), minus ""Those vulnerable immediately allowed resume life normal"".  

Pretty sure even Sweden that. restriction maximum amount gathering, restrictions amount space restaurants theatres, sports arenas mostly empty, people work home can. definitely ""Those vulnerable immediately allowed resume life normal"".     


On reddit censorship: there's rule side subreddit, states, reputable news sources allowed. website linked looks like link actual declaration used, therefore breaks rules.  allow following types posts: reputable news sources (this includes, limited to, BBC, BNO, Guardian, Washington Post, Reuters, Al Jazeera, South China Morning Post, New York Times, Caixin, CDC, etc.), discussion regarding economic impact, societal impact, travel bans, etc. I've watching Korea Japan Malaysia numbers now. SK numbers linger around 100 long imo. Needs stricter regulation. Maybe meant 1 8 symptomatic something like that? Idk. Definitely 1 8 general. Numbers add up.  actually lot worse. Studies show 25% people catch even asymptomatic, show signs myocarditis coronavirus. pull mask around people. Also, I’m pregnant riding uphills mask whenever I’m range others. it, you. Oh no, spooky MaIn sTrEaM MeDiA doctors scientists!! Agreed! Americans terrible controlling spread leaders even worse, surprise. real question percent acquired immunity we're at. think case numbers going slow much starts approaching level prohibitive sustaining current level transmission.

I truly hope closer think. Otherwise going like magnesium fire next 6-12 months. Yes, whole point subreddit (and /r/COVID19) provide forum discussion based high quality sources. places reddit discussed. Focus China next time? someone says Rabbi positive person, new meaning. Oh no. happened? Hope recover soon. seems East Asia island nations ones got truly contained. premise pandemics globalized society entirely wrong.

Locking waiting entirely impossible unless every person planet same. level coordination unseen.

The measures focus healing sick getting much capacity pull people trough, everything else folly. far... I'm willing bet Trump re-elected. advice I'm taking first sentence, expressed doubt Mike Parson nice. may well true. know read. Yes bring mask. Pull get within ten-ish feet someone else. It’s much ask, exercise without whenever aren’t near people. lost good friend another close friend sick waiting test results. We're noticeably stressed. older relatives shrug say ""it is"" ""it's God's hands."" One anti-mask in-law going wedding three weeks. know I'll lose another friend. can't deal sadistic attitudes anymore. People took seriously Spring. lucky outbreak started later handled pretty well. Since many people know people covid-19 died it, take seriously now. Especially since got used looser restrictions summer. spread visibly driven young people go parties, get tested wear masks shops public transport. still many responsible individuals age group, behave stupidly. taking account possibility [water [hostile taking advantage widespread I'm pessimist anything. Taking sensible precautions real pandemic we’re dealing “living fear”. 

I’m personally worried health, certainly don’t want infect someone might lucky. anyone doesn’t want lockdown everything power avoid spreading virus. world got European strain so... thing happened pandemic 1917. Dont kid yourself. Yes, saw paper. contradicts two dozen papers stated last 6 months. 

As papers shown virus actually active mechanisms interfere memory cell formation. come conclusion. said hope case.

Whatever motivation, petty thing make issue really germane main point post. distraction. see someone trying make pointless distraction whilst avoiding main point, question motivation. get that. don’t expect us double numbers time, still try maintain status USA #1 Good ole nothing Burgum 0.065% country, whoever prefers percentages. Even higher count many tens thousands excess deaths raising insurance rates everyone.

basically, beneficial society require seat belts. seems bit high, maybe we’ll get 200 million fatalities 30 years converges seasonal flu scenario. mask vaccine working? source mask usage? People claimed months low numbers Europe mask usage.

Hell, people two weeks ago claiming Italy well masks, suddenly stopped using numbers went up

Maybe time stop righteousness competition accept little known epidemic propagated cheap homemade masks arent efficient people started fool thinking Italy’s president murderer? apply US? Florida also hiding 10,000 deaths, climatic variables heavily favor, well many months advanced warning prepare 200000 families lost 6 family members. comment sections would much wholesome altruism people posted sensible constructive comments. programmer worked large amounts data don’t find hard believe... data messy, especially comes multiple sources time always consistent reliable. lies rub

I really wish countries would pick one simple solution stick it. Stop moving one set solutions another overnight. 

If means locking till vaccine it. means closing restaurants bars that. means open herd immunity that.

 constantly shifting messages making life unnecessary difficult everyone fatiguing population. Aren’t vaccines meant available high risk groups December/January? kind understand we’re Getting drunk frat parties necessary right now, someone high risk doesn’t mean miserable. People like ones dragging pandemic making unsafe others. see people responsibly. get drunk fuck party not. someone comes saying I’m hating greeks, Greek, know what’s parties. necessary OK right now. Lol wtf about, response literally nothing anything. asked life important yours, responded kind. No. Everyone always tells Swedes follow recommendations closely simply make include instructions change interact. Problem solved makes want actually die. mean it’s going happen sooner later people like now. Yes, won’t die aren’t religious correct. immunity/vaccination rate needed dependant RO value. RO &lt; 1 result eradication Measles needs 95% vaccination RO disease RO 2 need 50% immunity eradicate it.

Covid Seems around RO 2-4 mark depending season/location. Vaccine 80-90% effective 75% vaccination rate effective. people recognise safe expect proportion rise. isn’t counting existing immunity people infected. worth noting “near” case significantly six feet heavier breathing mean expelled particles go further.

True, although outside, distance tends make disperse enough. 

Anyway, pull mask going someone, like say riding bike. Bit seems... Hope never hurts. even close. Yeah, downplay seriousness pandemic, mortality rate even close 50%, would need higher mortality rate cut world population 50%. I'm binary?
You're literally dude mindset everything go away get entire world wear mask. Maybe one highest deaths rates world. Right. 

And lockdowns people wear masks, hospitals would overrun IFR would shoot up. 

Glad agree lockdowns, etc. He's one 40%. We’re back numbers April.
Thanks, Trump. Seasonal influenza’s CFR around 0.1%, *not* IFR (which closer 0.01%). wanted clarify that. lot people keep inadvertently comparing influenzas CFR COVID’s IFR ""lapses"" always running someone hops behind car someplace see them.

Other always avoid getting near people, period. Much Western Europe asleep wheel take seriously virus already rampage.

You compare cancer. rapid response early game makes difference. cancer manageable Stage 1 kill Stage 4.

A fast, decisive plan implemented community spread widely dispersed produces results ala New Zealand.  one would singing NZ's praises right Kiwis waited another 4-6 weeks lockdown. would still struggling procrastinated. Even know older people lived lives, still great tragedy. healthy 70 years old still able enjoy life e.g. traveling playing grandkids. bad leave world sooner necessary. thought makes sad. pray find peace life beyond. Fat idiot: know, there’s thing much masks according report, novel coronavirus far dangerous deadlier flu. cause serious, long-term damage lungs, brain, kidneys vital organs. Since vaccine yet developed, several different therapies tested hospitals across world.

The flu also causes long-term damage lungs, brain, kidneys vital organs.

Google it. Ha! 8 month ago calculated correctly. 
 school kids go to, bus driver infected. Nobody quarantined notified. 
Multiple teachers infected cases school, nobody notified.
Called dept health never returned calls.
What fuck going on? Great, blind us too. great.  No, sacrificing Boomers hang little longer. Boomers fueled 2008 recession exotic financial instruments investments, driving real estate roof even oppose affordable housing, slashed social programs give another tax cut.

The generation given us least done damage needs more! (one else's) sacrifice good great! Also worth noting “near” case significantly six feet heavier breathing mean expelled particles go further. 

I like bike around blocks surrounding house exercise. don’t usually see many people take mask case spot anyone else sidewalk put mask way I’m close enough wonder need I’d rather overly cautious doesn’t hurt so. 

They ended mask mandate county bad before. It’s way worse now. dinguses

I believe plural dingi.  Nah literate check post history. do. 1 scientist advocating total lockdown prevent Possible ICU overflows (long way ICU capacity problems. reason ICU intake rising would expect). 
They also listen doctors, example oncologist total lockdown. Economists predict lockdown would cause deaths long run etc.  Wasn’t established months ago? getting voted bit, agree. exactly want catch - _the known unknown long term effects_. Downplayers fucking worst. get information peer reviewed stating X fact. comes 200 people stating things like"" irrelevant fact think important?! proof dont know talking X Z ( often misunderstood ) year old article covid!"". Good luck getting people go along it. force businesses close (until enough say fuck remain open) help people start gathering private residences. forgot part history China locked outside world. China definitely need be.

China still locked world, that's point. I'm saying full Wuhan-style lockdown could probably enforced countrywide scale - would destroyed economy. China got incredibly lucky 23rd January virus yet spread significantly beyond Hubei despite lack measures time. key trace virus early, lockdown, test everyone, isolate sick reopen. think late USA Europe now, I'm pointing could been, that's all.

Many European countries exactly that. Denmark Greece example went hard lockdown less thousand total cases. integrated countries average European country is, virus bound come back one way another. Italy took measures stop spread via lockdown.  president argues dont need mask... Yeah many subs Reddit borderline unusable there’s upcoming election :/ saying ‘fuck it’ waiting blow vaccines? Cases rising ain’t shit domestic transmitted cases China almost two months. hear man it’s fucked society &amp; economic system built fact people spend days pointless shit stay alive. (I worked event sector half bullshit.)

I’m also high af told partner humans exist waste time die may right mindset pandemic solutions. No? percent acquired immunity we're at. think case numbers going slow much starts approaching level prohibitive sustaining current level truly hope closer think

I, too, truly hope there's Easter bunny We're six months US. point scary new surprise. understand somebody's intial reaction disbelief denial. *still* convinced big deal half year passed people still getting sick, lot sympathy ""this real"" viewpoint.

You say they're philosophizing (yes, word), I'd argue -- they're making conspiracy theories going social media crusades in-person protests wearing masks. (And protests *about* masks! They're jobs!)

Not taking things seriously cause suffering continue longer should. I'd tell want keep health get job back sooner, follow guidelines (wash hands, wear mask, social distancing, etc) encourage everybody around same. think quantify contagiousness modeling many people you’d expect see infected time period many people would kill given IFR. One thing super variable would like see quantification overrun healthcare system - odds many collateral deaths would cause? feel like lot hand-waving done don’t really know much except it’s exceptionally contagious prone hospitalizing victims. Close border Florida Like said, IFR different different regions. Countries old unhealthy populations probably higher others. Italy old population, USA big problem obesity etc.
Africa young population seems hardly affected, bring global IFR (its opposite flu especially deadly developed countries dangerous poorer due lacking health care, example Ethipia 60-70k people dying flu year, far 5k deaths covid, similar proportions Philippines etc) South Korea US pretty different (seems continental Europe would better comparison) still telling. Appreciate info. 6 months since China's plateau. they're lying *any* evidence emerged time? need know fatality rate also medium term long term damage rate. like censorship. think adults can’t think themselves. Gotcha...good talk. Bend, Oregon still travel restriction October 26, apparently helping too. I’m actually suicidal right thanks rock. recall said maximum 1/10th it. take average 0.6% makes sense. Yeah, I've Lao Cai heard stories Chinese around there..

It's totally different scenario Europe though, borders invisible millions work 'abroad' closing borders would caused total economic collapse. benefits closing borders stood disruption lockdown also applied Wuhan parts Hubei. one city China (or one province 34). parts lockdowns.

Hubei harshest lockdowns, pretty much everywhere 'lockdown' form another. Practically *everything* closed back February stayed closed virus went away. like West reopened schools businesses virus still raging. Misinformation category reporting people subs. too. Sounds like like make lots claims yet never provide sources. that? Interesting. early advocate 8 10 weeks lockdown March April time frame argument far fewer cases time US, even increases infection rates lockdown lifted, would fundamentally starting pool fewer infections grow.

I've gotten little resistance that. Maybe threads choose interact in? know. I've mostly seen deniers downrated Oblivion. YMMV obviously. Wear indoors actual positive effect. important hers?

ETA: nice ninja edit way Thank you. TBF, Woodrow Wilson (a democrat) lead us Spanish flu. definitely guilty downplaying it. Lol bot always knew. discovered first place. DeSantis' eventual criminal prosecution appalling dereliction duty fill hours cable news time could prevented. completely needless. knowledge. means. science. social political structures. we, species, use things intelligently. failing species control, contain eradicate horrifying disease. like job impossible, even difficult. could accomplished single month, chose - planet - so.

I disappointed humanity right now. Really shows real patriots country are... many claim patriots supporter troops. turn something small wear mask protect country, can't even bothered. Thank do. would obviously hell lot cases without masks. know that’s works.  knows whether lockdown could enforced countrywide scale.

You forgot part history China locked outside world. China definitely need be.

The key trace virus early, lockdown, test everyone, isolate sick reopen. think late USA Europe now, I'm pointing could been, that's all. living fear would leave front door. Instead put mask, go work, go store, go outdoor movies, outdoor concerts, even fucking professional soccer games ffs (all spaced out, course). Lots friends still afraid stuff, really. ""misinformation"" referring to? can't know refer it. source regardless. questions safety attend vaccine, **there good reasons especially cautious COVID-19**. vaccines worsen consequences infection rather protect, phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). **ADE observed previous attempts develop coronavirus vaccines.** add concern, antibodies typical ADE present blood COVID-19 patients. **Such concerns real.** recently 2016, Dengavxia, intended protect children dengue virus, increased hospitalizations children received vaccine.

Now I've provided sources, please unremove comment.

Why ask people sources though?  also shut state borders.

For while, EU countries other. EU countries also banned intra-country movements.

Then reopened them, local spread effectively zero international borders still closed. could case EU. moment people travel pretty much everywhere within China (provided travel all, in, health code green). get point is. Given 75% adults worldwide plan get vaccinated immunity rate 95% needed eradicate disease eradication absolutely happen anytime soon definitely end 2021.

It take *years* vaccinate everyone willing get it. current goal vaccinate 20% world population end 2021 20% specific group people - health care workers vulnerable Anyone thinks things back normal end 2021 very, wrong. jajajaja national mask mandate coming end January... yeah that's definitely gonna trick three months later going millions additonal infected people. positive get tested! South Korea population 52 million first case time US.

South Korea 400 deaths.

With proper leadership, US could well 10,000 fatalities. life important mine? anyone elses? Frat parties essential. hard predict. like 5 different frontrunner vaccines moment show nothing positive results terms safety efficacy far (with 3 nearly complete already), hundred others development across world. that's like half year work far. borderline absurd point believe never reasonably effective vaccine disease. China shut borders, also shut state borders. Cross-state communication/travel China even integrated countries EU. agree totally. people sub often correlate things like bars reopening case spikes next day.

It seems like confirmation bias. cases go up, people following rules. don't, people following rules. logical framework, there's absolutely room alternative explanations. reality many factors epidemic testing, seasonality, geography immunity.

I think precautions impact, many factors play. Treating precautions like factor spread narrow-minded opinion. MIL stopped wearing mask got covid 2 weeks ago. still denies exists suffering 10 days. Loss smell, cough, fever... Jesus. Yeah, good point, guess there's always the, ""it's archaic government system"" variable. estimates burden illness 2018–2019 season included estimated 35.5 million people getting sick influenza, 16.5 million people going health care provider illness, 490,600 hospitalizations, 34,200 deaths hope come this. One day, hope care 34,200 preventable deaths influenza.

If can't sympathize say COVID worse flu, suggesting acceptable every year economy burdened 35.5 million people calling sick health care system overturned. 

Maybe result COVID aware preventative measures flu.  schools opening three weeks ago Yes, schools opening aswell Italy three weeks ago Time single again. think anything taught China easy way attack west. Create new viruses ""moderately deadly"" watch western countries melt due idiocy inability govern. UK govt models March based around assumption 0.64 IFR know what? outcome would *had* tested. What? then? see lose job this. know Sweden country grow Q1 countries dropped (because lockdown March) explains relatively large drop Q1 Q2. honest comparison would look quarters combined. got downvoted treated like moron multiple times saying suspected covid immunity would likely short term despite fact that's normal coronaviruses, pointing airborne droplets cdc giving biased information, naturally acquired herd immunity work, 6 feet rule, etc., etc..

Certain information suppressed prevent panic, slowly surfacing.

Immunity lasts months, meaning vaccines largely useless often promoted idea vaccine get us fata morgana. airborne, masks social distancing minimal benefits. measures effect full lockdowns.

All hope reinfection _generally_ less bad first time. so, people gradually build resistance accept losing ~1% population process. case, sooner get with, better. underrated point. get high school varsity league players want lose scholarships, college leagues dependent income, professional leagues offer entertainment, but, seriously, WTF? strictly recreational activities dropped little controversy. Watch games last year. put kid harms way pandemic, kids supervision. borders closed, essential economic activity. can't countries close borders? closed Australia, fact island nothing it. France close off, suggesting infected individuals bordering countries would sneaking in? Also, European union. can't countries coordinate closed borders much like states Australia did. think USA Europe put everything 'too hard' basket made situation far worse gone hard early lockdown like Australia, new Zealand, China, Vietnam Taiwan Florida country they'd #5 world deaths per capita.

That's why. 

Wake up. last time row breaking /r/Futurology next year: Scientists finds way use Covid targeting lung Cancer Mesothelioma like meat packing plants: virus die quickly.

I want disagree completely, meat-packing plants notorious recirculated air structured employees ALWAYS within inches other.

Otherwise, right. I'm sure recirculated air also integral ice rinks. questions China. How's situation currently? reliable sources they're dealing Covid-19 days?  Since Denmark Norway started using masks since middle/end August, comparing ""total deaths per capita"" give answer question asking. deaths per capita since 15th August (I added Finland well, since made changes mask policy well time): Hour out.

Weekends ""trip"" big city. since commuting daily, drive feel fun. form travel islands similar countries - Taiwan, China, Vietnam, Japan. already happening. Hell empty devils here. governor DicksAndTits seem sharpest tool shed. sex airborne :[ Anyone know follow-up trials Cordoba Calcifediol study? changing anything, always said new clusters could suppressed local restrictions; restrictions April. go full wuhan

The mantra unfit leadership. 2022. Even Fauci predicted summer 2021 widespread vaccination, emergency use authorization much earlier healthcare workers etc. Contact tracing 13 thousand people day still seems like tall order. could probably several % though. necessarily. China better pandemic control efficient competent leadership social infrastructure.  Vaccine development China's forte. would still put bet US/UK/Germany overall better vaccines. 

That point. matter US/UK/Germany better overall vaccines. people, especially US, refuse take them. There's already large percentage people anti-vax. think happen Western media starts vilifying China's vaccines 24/7 news cycles? many people get vaccinated hearing dangerous vaccines be? know Western media enough know they're going this. going backfire. They're shooting again. shit? export-oriented industry losing due pandemic?! likely outcome.
Also, there's 50% chance person placebo group. NZ unique opportunity though. Small, two island country easily monitored borders, low population density. everywhere thing That’s exactly I’m wondering too. found though look “active cases” post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* actions based stupid ideas consequences. happen accident. need read lips, no? 10%? rookie numbers, least 100%! Maybe 200%. Nice Yes world left, shithole. world great again, *so good*. True. Australia one luckier proactive countries, whichever way want see it, state Victoria, worst hit state, using masks despite small protests. states, notably NSW, top-notch contact tracing dealing new cases. Omg. Thank you. lockdowns bought time treatments get better.

what improvements? know remdesivir cuts hospital stay time, dexamethasone helps severe cases too. Yeah thinking fatalilities climb winter. mean, went hospital Covid dying, you’d probably allowed Regarding ""do like Sweden people"" totally agree! 

Sweden probably left wing democratic country world left wing response pandemic. (left distribution wealth) 

Lots people think Swedens restrictions loose, swedes really high trust government recomendation Sweden might effective police/military enforced ""law"" countries. really believe government best help citizens. government get understand mean. 

The fact politicians dont interfere pandemic response also factor. polics involved, even semi racist anti establishment party Swedish Democrats largely quit. sort concensus stick together finished start political fight again. Sort war. 

When Public Health Agency says ""stay home"" Swedes consideres trust would doctor told personally stay home. believe Public Health Agency experts say. 

There statistics supporting fact trust government most. 65% Swedes trust government. average OECD 37 %. 

They also trust eachother most, placing third world. 

98% children vaccinated even though mandatory, also one highest levels world. 

Sweden 3rd democratic 4th least corrupt country world. 

If look mobility data Sweden managed almost aswell recomendations countries like spain, UK etc police force.
 cost practically eliminating international travel, keeping kids school, allowing sporting events concerts, keeping people “at home,” requiring masks everywhere, locking businesses? It’s worth it. I’d rather live world flu. one anti mask guys? large-scale studys usually designed way makes impossible even give medication/vaccine know receives placebo receives real thing. data stored secret list people know injection IDs correspond placebo. matching generated randomly, there's bias.

In end secret list revealed, find received what. [blinded probably unblind one patient (or illness over)? turns received placebo, actually good news long they're registering number covid infections vaccinated group. RIVM (think like Dutch CDC) telling people *months* masks work. now. 

Just last week, ""strongly advised"" wear mask. little, late. means: IFR constant. Japan winter different IFR Uganda. know data including Africa, continent nearly everyone kid teen, used elderly Europe prove bad flu. Victoria's case different though, done rejoin covid- part world, borders closed covid+ part.

In France US, stage game get cases down... what? Can't country Europe try eradicate, it'll keep leaking others. Europe could easily done China

No, couldn't. gone Wuhan-style lockdown together time right found first cases Italy.

They didn't. one knew anything time. already late. 

China got zero cases because, outside Hubei, basically handful cases begin with. Again, absolutely comparable. didn’t test negative election important. know, try that. average change much estimates Africa available, numbers used elderly ""prove"" bad flu.  Yep, although Melbourne avoided them.

This want fuck things April - good option time. Heavy hand gets issues, nothing gets people pulling drawbridge going rate gets high everything grinds halt anyway. 

Good governance counts. everyone got would reason start taking seriously would stop spreading Read text, read data steroids heparin, read data LFA tests.  infuriates Westerners still seem unwilling look East Asians successes. PRC, RoC, RoK, VN S'pore handled pandemic remarkably better. one willing concede that. Compared done nothing we're ideas.  America man, know don’t learn anything. really something that’s uncomfortable.

Except people bad hearing really reading lips. cares them, right? May get sick teach lesson really wonder asthma patients medication.

I mean, far know asthma chronic disease, hospitalized asthma complications times kid. take meds many years. since turned \~18, I'm fine. asthma issues. medication required. I'm 30 now.

I'm still sure I'm high risk severe Covid not. someone tell going sudden surges imagining things? husband left UWS March - know TWO families still there. purchased apartments can’t sell don’t means leave. EVERYONE else left. high income people (my family five living parents 7 months point). can't. animal reservoirs. fair, EU chart, totally relevant Swedish numbers.

Edit: Fixed can't come together world take responsibility, put masks stop fucking about? exactly contest anyone want win. work somewhat closely someone tested positive. Several employees also tested positive. trying keep quiet there's contact tracing. tested positive days ago interact many different people slice older often oxygen tanks. Agreed. Australia announced we’re recession second financial quarter red. Cases world wide still growing millions. vaccine yet. Next year 3 months away it’s struggle optimistic 2021. may look back 2020 better year. least we’re broke yet. keep closed forever. virus endemic. eradication. even vaccine. Aha yes globalist neo liberalism ... leftist. fat idiot pretending nothing worry definitely negative global effect, yes. news France know, also selfish idiots want right thing, inconvenient them. Trump responsible hundreds thousands deaths plenty come extremely likely People pro vaccine turn antivaxxers come election. 

The people claim getting ""rushed-out"" vaccine angry politicians receive experimental drugs. Without public support get ritots. That’s point though isn’t it. world economies tied together country bouncing back easily one else is? Lets go U.S.A! They're catching up. least one vaccines currently tested showed moderate effect upper respiratory tract full protection lungs. 

In case, infection would still possible illness would resemble common cold. it’s taking 3 days? next? 3 hours? Since it’s 3, Illuminati confirmed sports teams still meeting beyond me.  site full click bait bullshit. think many 10% yet recovered much fundamental. Almost every developed country faced exactly problem, latest excuse Swedes Reddit. show Swedish nursing homes suffered average developed nation's nursing home similar COVID-19 infection rate, eat hat.

EDIT: fundamental part Swedish exceptionalism: belief things explained unique way explain unique Swedish result. Sorry results pretty much average level precautions taken. Something like 50? counting asymptomatic carriers is. dont think know vaccines work. act corpse body dissect find kill. wont help someone currently infected, certainly inhaling Complete misinformation. phased less effective needle due adverse reactions. reformulated back market. literally making up. Could please elaborate? theres lot progressive things either first implement known for, reputation progressive isnt fully earned anymore, especially considering many countries caught lag behind. coast past accomplishments, feel like keeps us looking critically inward, prevents actual dialogue taking place. issue too, sometimes :/

Are eating enough appointments? Maybe quite dense... yeah sure I'm down. risk going Dr's office get vaccine get sitting porch. inhaled injected want shit over. I'm going go sifting articles I've read since pandemic started, top head mention happened Florida someone losing job refused doctor numbers turned whistle-blower. 

I'm using 'feel good', nothing feel good situation we're Europe, asking compare US Europe. Right now, US like China, pick choose numbers disclose. administration sway CDC, actually administration controls everything, we've seen behaved year. cannot compare Europe, much clearer numbers.

Yes, UK 'glitch' lead tens thousands unreported cases. Yes, France basically screwed anything it. no, leaders saying exist, hoax, go away. Look latest discourse Spanish leadership, French leadership, Boris Johnson. 

Anyway, trash comment based 'people trying feel good' - lol RIP, I've isolating since February mum cancer, ain't nothing good situation. Lol. guys pathetic. plenty issues world get even fraction attention covid gets. 

10 million die hunger year, yet neither media governments give shit. That’s UN food programme got Nobel peace prize year. 1 million old farts die west suddenly genocide. terrible. Like spraying little masks yer nose. India: hold butter chicken. we’ve seen again, “lockdown” includes lots exceptions jogging activities really lockdown. voluntary compliance citizens drive infection rates down, restrictions eased numbers go back up.

Therefore mitigation strategy doomed fail long run — eradication strategy, extremely harsh lockdown restrictions shorter period time, viable.

But it’s possible U.S. European governments impose true lockdown, restrictions culturally tolerated many cases violate existing laws and/or written constitutions. We’re going rough shape another year. somebody horrible outdoor indoor allergies; hard enough breathing, effectiveness greatly vary. 

Thanks stay traditional shot Although I’m fan Needles, still willing get shot. really good news me! already got lil balls foil nose. Read up. Population density doesn’t matter population isn’t homogeneously distributed. sure isn’t Sweden. Vast uninhabited areas north. People crowding cities south. 

**Urbanisation** matters way more. 88% Swedes live cities/urban areas compared 64% Irish. 

So, summarise, 
* Ireland: 1012 infected one day population 5. Low urbanisation. 
* Sweden: 1694 infected one day (haven’t faced checked, trusting you) population 10M. High urbanisation. 

So, numbers sure support claim. 

Then, period didn’t numbers, couldn’t trust March/April? That’s probably different story. people fear needles reality people feint needles extremely rare compared dislike needles. 

Even then, feinting actually big deal. Lie down, get shot, feint, wake up, protected deadly virus. That's still brainer. Genes, post yesterday talking theory makes sense especially random infections/deaths may seem 2 sets rules = rules. don’t listen, I? look something like that? Well, got us point civilization addressed corrected, look forward decades shit-shows. CDC estimates 9 45 million cases year US. Lol love sub sometimes Firstly, politicians decide kind things here, would they, epidemiologists. Secondly, herd immunity strategy. Thirdly, economy, general public health long-run. pointing got statistic since asked. speaking defense it. Man awesome video idk poster talking need think bit surface (most people don't), see happening here. making announcement case numbers increasing massively, countries way containment lockdown. also praise Gupta. saying very, clear. Think twice. one greatest thing get see humans vulnerable state, help get better even go deepest shit, still feels satisfying make it. also job social team oriented. honestly struggled throughout nursing school I'm naturally shy introverted man however came much confident ever was. also almost endless possibilities, I've nurse 5 years long term care, nursing homes, palliative care, visits home check people psychiatry like best. 
However, downsides absolutely crushing, forced overtime, shit schedules, get thrown begin, done places barely give formation unit throw pit. Managers absolutely disconnected reality.
We much paperwork end seeing files papers humans. find doctors nice others absolute assholes. nurses btw. One nurse worked early think men nurse ignored me. covid. covid everything got ten times worse, managers care health really, bet give us PPE would get sick would even understaffed. order makes sense. Everything changes daily we've never stress fear safety. Oh btw, I'm Canada U.S. hear even worse... 
I see new nurses coming honestly tell there's good this. They've never known anything better get ""better"" pandemy. 

Honestly, I'd think twice time, still honestly like work, hate everything around it... Oddly, I'm opposite. mind blood draws, get panic attacks brain imagines foreign body forced blood stream... Often ""cold"" sensation way limb. intellectually know work way, phantom sensation nonetheless, along panic attack. stop getting vaccine though. matter form. Glad well everyone tests positive, symptoms (his words) gets check hospital like resort week, best medical care. even close. hypothesis why? making average freshman biochemistry level mistakes like complicated problem. 

And failing create working test, also blocked every private entity creating testing labs hospitals sloppy.

And working test, give anyone people basically knew COVID anyway, telling asymptomatic likely-infected people go home infect everyone too. Weekend delay? People would sneaking in. almost impossible seal big borders noone sneaking in. never succeeded keeping refugees out, right ?

And would sneaking ? millions people family france, people living close border,...

During first wave European countries closed borders, still plenty illegal traffic going border (I live close border region know people going border time time) double check, think hairdresser orange zone, think closed that. appointment later week. open I'll go. user blatant troll, argues sides fence. waste time basing seriously take virus badly affects fat fuck. 
If makes alive, literally FUCK INSIDE WEAR MASK TIMES. 
JESUS FUCK DUDE KILLING ELDERY PARENTS

within day other. Here's 6 days f\*aggot thinks I’m ‘hunkering down’ loosing job flu go love himself.

And here's 12 days FUCK YOU. DEADLY ASS VIRUS GOING AROUND! NEEDS trash. need won't. unethical. China need wait major global event. Americans might fuck up. Shame you. Maybe John Lennon something, ""Imagine"" Eh models always wrong. someone makes models living generally show realistic possible outcome. Especially good amount data input assumptions used models theoretically getting accurate.

That said, models often times completely wrong. Yes get it. never want life ""go back normal"". really need keep sharing every single day helpful anyone. Yeah fuck allergies even get flu shot! News.com.au trash. u/FreedomsTorch, care show subscriber list shows officials' signatures? I'm working project I'm documenting pandemic looking people share experiences, thoughts feelings virus.

I would like incorporate handwritten experiences, thoughts feelings virus book. could good/bad short long whatever feeling!

If want help let know 😁 Trump? surrounding area owned/founded Dutch

By Dutch joint-stock corporations, specifically. every American colony learn about, there's corresponding joint-stock corporation, new invention time.

Plymouth Plymouth Virginia Amsterdam Dutch West India infection begin settle endemic levels least 60% people infected least once. way, way future. Sweden probably bit cases, since testing capabilities limited back then. However, Sweden twice population, urbanisation (overall population density irrelevant country uninhabited forest). people don’t get it. Even superspreader events, majority people get it. Worst worlds Whatever makes feel better guess. Still seems little odd things would need happen daily People seem understand mask cover nose, virus pass one person one person, groups, contagious symptoms. Frequently see people pairs remove masks neither sick. I've told need wear mine nobody coughing, always respond I've around lot people I'm teacher know I'm spreading I'll wear mask everybody's protection. I'm ESL teacher Morocco. ""stop using lockdowns primary control method""
which quite opposite toddler-level declaration. border line conspiracy theorist, ways could administered someone without knowing kinda freaks out. Kind fan. technology exists though, guess going anywhere. Yup. pay attention countries. Basically, lot Fox News watchers. Yeah you’re 50+ chances you’ve bout pneumonia life. don’t extensively test post infection symptoms like people COVID, public interest simply isn’t there. Fuck cults! people, even here, floated idea society outright abandoning social distancing and/or masks within months (i.e. January-March, so).

I know true legal would then, definitely *shouldn't* case. know might hard accept, *staying healthy keeping family safe important going Aunt Marie's house Thanksgiving*. think? Sure, sad, know, see holidays 2020 go drain, *these unprecedented circumstances, we're learning adapt together*. avoiding risky situations, make sure Aunt Marie contract severe COVID end hospital permanent brain damage!

And that's support extensions government restrictions, addition national mask mandate January. Breaking pandemic guidelines = breaking law. even calling ""guidelines"" first place, actually; fact, *I think sort subtle messaging indirectly responsible inability respect science*. really keep us rowdy Americans check, it? particular true countries weaker economy one heavily dependent services social contact like cafes, restaurants night clubs. Combine culture evenings spent larger groups outside house, understand Mediterranean countries particular economically socially going able sustain second lockdown restrictive package measures resembling it. flat wrong. Either trust them, easy choice. doesn’t, bloke you’re replying either misinformed. much ~~fun~~ booze guess. Alcohol Achilles' heel. politicians literally CANNOT make 6 month lockdown work out? can't afford also likely even legal? uncivilised nations, one add. it’s primary tool government. 

There's states Australia would disagree you. Um... no. take injection please thank you. don’t know thought would helpful.  mass-administer way? Spraying planes example? Oh man take care pandemic already reposted yesterday’s thread, fact you’ve somehow made even misinformed here.

Still waiting Boris’ speech summary. New ..? um wtf think people still refuse wear masks that's hardly bit deal either. idea? still around. option year. Went shot. have! help, another nurse even held hand 😅 reason, get up, get lightheaded changed title submitted it. used title article previously published. question can’t get answered anywhere. boyfriend (who don’t live with) contracted Covid 3 weeks ago. finished quarantine 10 day isolation, gave another week half safety. roommate contracted it, also finished 10 day isolation today. 
I’m seeing tonight I’m scared could catch virus kissing him. possible? need vaccine something 99.8% survivable 6,000,0000,000 people already? Nowadays, finding blame important trying solve problem itself. thought estimate spring pretty reasonable. reddit. Nobody asks anything. stated something publicly, expect public response. didn’t reference disability once. comment wasn’t it. really clue point is? Right preventing suffering death argument. moronic faux intellectual. Yea, using pretty poor simplistic metrics measuring number cases. already know reported numbers cases world vastly underestimating infections. Even decent measurements cases going undetected. 

The real infection rates vs hospitalization going population samples 3%. Lol, actually it’s funny say that. might. don’t. it’s primary tool government. primary tools prevention. Masks, testing, tracing isolation. one wants lockdowns. one. Constantinople get works? Absolutely crap journalism. “They would effective” completely unsubstantiated could proven via clinical trial. isn’t new idea. flumist years consistently less effective shot. expect next week find WHO's funding restored relations normalized. LOL :) Auckland basically suburban, that's ""the big city"".

NZ very, sparsely populated overall. I'm confused...how know got vaccine placebo? got placebo, exactly want happen - people placebo group get infected That's Toronto used like, except Chinatown allowed open. Imagine city big Toronto shutting Sundays? case recent 25 years ago. saying wait two weeks? Really?

Why people feel damned sure everything? much work, honestly. takes much emotional energy, I’m honest.

I’m sorry one came help you. realize open link see article’s headline isn’t post title, right? love honesty, fact you’re AWARE this, too.

I’ve seen lot Redditors “plans” kind stuff we’ve discussing, without thought way through, makes sense. Adapting temporary. Stating reality imply permanence. adapt situation find yourself. Also answering anything. question asked. stated experience someone disability dont point specific chain. answer similarly disabled. entitled ass trying talk do.

But I'm engaging further. nothing contribute. India problems live vaccines ago? wish could remember exactly believe outbreak Guillian-Barre oral H1N1 vaccine.

Please someone correct wrong partially incorrect. Ever heard term ""grasping straws""? good job demonstrating it. common control evidence suggests strict 60 day lockdown would go pretty far control (not eradication-full eradication necessary, possible country large) followed local control implemented swiftly first signs trouble. problem getting 50 states board impossible shutting interstate travel illegal, I'm pretty sure level strict examined also illegal good ol USA. Less less reasonable people sub! Thank you! I’m you. I’d still take 12 inch dildo needed inserted 100% without lube guaranteed would end really Democrat vs. Republican deal virus still hold countries America. Germany almost 5000 new cases yesterday mexico seems hovering around 4000 day since June. Maybe could take India's response virus. 70000 new cases yesterday. I'm think much american political spectrum, really shitty virus. Please, cut crap consistent. 

If China's President Xi said press conference covid worse flu, hydroxychloroquine cure covid, international media would reported ""China claims coivd like flu"", something like that. 

But US President says something stupid, attributed entire country America, individual. 

Only hypocrite embrace double standards. writing American. kind crazy minds' work. exact opposite. Imagining foreign drug something entering body help get sick faze slightest. Knowing something vital (in case blood) makes get really woozy. True. bonus, can't catch disease too. good risked spreading VIRUS across region killing people ... hope “mental health” better.... lockdown wasn’t half added achieving original goal, preventing medical system overwhelmed giving time prepare. point ventilators hospital beds critically low supply anywhere county level. 

The curve successfully flattened. Social distancing never pitched scorched earth approach eradication. never option. Lots people want willingly destroy thier countries seems. Yeah, I'll leave ye it. Logic gone window. guys manage propaganda even Coronavirus subreddits.. relentless climate propagandists. called religion already? Holy shit. fucking dictatorial whack job country from?

This virus sub 1% death rate proposing flushing constitution bill rights toilet? PLease stay home come public. get socked mouth hard working americans faster say ""but keep safe"" used get FluMist scientists realized nothing. Ever since needle vaccines. Hopefully 'spray vaccine' covid effective useless one Flu was.  Wrong. Nerve damage completely painless. Going cultural victory route since everyone nukes military victory basically impossible. Would really rather someone goes scientific victory builds spaceship alpha centauri tbh :/ much lower case counts, things done somewhat alleviate spread-required recent testing + masking outdoor visit, example. winds really dangerous things uncontrolled right now. Canada US quite similar lot ways. large cities population density. areas little population wide open spaces. Yet, country dealt covid differently US twice death rate Canada. continues vaccine available herd immunity achieved US mortality likely triple Canada's. understand idea 'doing nothing' would save lives. someone explain? You’re right: important distinction. Case rate’s one thing, really useless stand-alone metric. 

Hospitalizations rising? That’s bad. future, people shocked erradicate flu earlier. country, Canada, 38,000,000 million people. half new cases despite population 7 times theirs. Scary. Pray Ireland. Nah man, got better idea! *slaps side crop duster* Wear blindfold. can’t see - it’s literally prick.  inhaled flu vaccine live, patients may become temporarily contagious? Especially boomers seem content continually fuck things younger generation...they responsible pandemic seem dead set anything global warming Formites remain concern still suspected form transmission.  Agreed respiratory primary form transmission. contains circumstantial evidence formite transmission. Weird language choices. Could easier, may work better. say idiots willing take less like vaccine  Look point, one *except* idiots believe climate change fake. one *except* idiots believe COIVD fake. someone trying suggest course action goes best science regarding climate pandemic, person either trying profit suffering idiot. Yeah well they're wrong. one silly issue. Netherlands deep second wave new cases rising every day, point we're worse pretty much country terms new cases per 100k population. 

ehh, bunch countries like france worse are. arent worse pretty much country. covid deaths.

we shouldve done much better though. rutte's reluctance getting little annoying say least. it’s don’t mind it

Title sextape They're different man. prep too, gotten flu shot year last year. really even feel flu shot, done quickly. Getting blood drawn process, hurts, forces think way long. shutdowns happen states. fucked nothing dislike. science says truth is. People find truth inconvenient often try discredit science. article showing people already find truth inconvenient already prioritize profits humanity trying thing COVID. Spent 3 weeks western Canada mid-pandemic incredible. Cheap flights, low amount tourist. Revitalized mental health helped realize life must go on. would go stores one wearing mask, I’m okay that. Live let live. you’re risk, stay home. Don’t want take risk, stay home. can’t control people, much pains people subreddit. Enjoy life. Y’all afraid die, you’re even living anymore. That's reporter talking, scientists experiment. It’s mostly actually, much rest us. Madrid, Spain went emergency lock last week.

[Scroll questions? broad shift media. would assume somebody implied that? know damn well stray narrative one second. 

There need medical experts downplaying anything. called data.

You know, stuff that's manipulated political purposes? stuff? obviously completely false. Much less corona NZ typically would flu. Sorry go that. really hope feeling good well now! several auto-immune diseases doctor said triggered “some virus” — neither us know which. Viruses trigger autoimmune diseases. would huge surprise learning Covid ***didn’t***. 

Of course does. properly representing website entire focal point line discussion, what's even point?

Is also declaration numerous fake signatures? Good point, wasn’t thinking labs PrEP monitoring. MAs draw labs may never even see patients come something like that. One cool things science repeat experiment see results stand themselves. Surprisingly, none acquaintances recovered died (in total, 10-20% population ill Russia). signing volunteers (stage 3 vaccine) mass testing, also give placebo (2-3 days temperature vaccine) (in Russia, vaccine must registered stage 3, clear much fuss comes from) . since people trust government, less 40% people plan vaccinated 2021

In general, IMHO Russia die less, men rarely live 60. poor health men die 60 years.

Well, patients coronavirus immediately given package medicines vitamins told treated home. sick taken hospital. Conspiracy theory believers Conspiracy theory deniers two side coin don’t realize it. Believers latch theory find provide rationality something find disturbing unsettling. Conspiracy theory deniers, reject hypothesis mystery unusual situation immediately, theory causes unsettling disturbing feelings true. 

Let’s use example. Let ask question give hypothesis proposed solution. actually scientific method. 

Why China appear virus well controlled comparison rest world?

Deniers immediately claim simply asking question conspiratorial. Believers immediately reply various theories seen floating about. 

However intriguing important question might help rest world. need asked, correct? Agreed. “We know set off, it!” get every vaccine us needle phobes get one! Would beneficial various forms vaccines production distributions sake? touch eyes stick fingers nose **should** good Nerve damage painful. thing happen 8. honestly probably wasn’t Covid. Mine virus killed sensorineural hairs right cochlea.

I would think event Covid happening time coincidental. good thing countries already started disinfect banknotes early **February**. responsible governments started thing. someone hates sore throats, including brief ones nasal sprayers cause, I'll take needle. marfalump many kind people lol Americans fattest comfortable people world. little struggle sesh police happened developing world would thousands deaths. nothing happened, Americans, right left, want go life without daily hot beef injections massages underpaid foreigners hard time hearing someone better hearing anything loved one dead.  

The pandemic sucks. see world depressing year 5 years hopefully rearview mirror. 

Wearing mask ever, like wearing scarf winter cold winter days. 


Masks allow us get sooner. Assuming people keep distance. least Germany rise seems coming people simply taking proper friend wife's wedding bride outright stated ""masks optional"" ""we'll virtual procession health concerns"". clinic blood draw confirmatory testing positive rapid test, pretty rare honestly. Depending sexual history, *may* blood draw (especially we’re already drawing blood STI testing) people get finger prick recommend follow testing another month history indicates need. **YOU NEED SAY LOUDER, NEEDLEPHOBIC, BETTER WORK.** 


Damn Virus 200% anxiety. get sick, needles would involved far many nightmare me. enough going pregnancy. sounds like someone either Russia China would say Ah. Interesting example. Md? wrong. 

I feel like paragraph explains best, saying lockdowns work straight illogical. whole article looking arguments made breaking down, citing studies prove wrong. Aside evidence, also hard imagine lockdown, greatly reduces frequency human contact, could possibly fail impact spread infectious agent. epidemiology another universe. Indeed, scientists clearly seen effects lockdown year's flu Northern Hemisphere countries. January, expected year among worst flu seasons several decades. number flu infections dropped sharply in April, long Covid-19 lockdowns imposed. Another weird Pfizer vaccine trial candidate, wouldn’t worry needle boys. Honestly pleasant vaccine I’ve received life, didn’t even register happening another nurse asking questions. son moderate severe asthma that's specifically triggered allergies respiratory illness. need wait shots mist thing available COVID-19.

I hope stay healthy. someone cries thought needles, YES trial one may ask also ""Don't afraid COVID. let dominate life."" Everyone made fun China back February rest world sat back shit all. we're wondering done sooner People deny one type obviously evident science trustworthy evaluate type science. Would let flat earther influence views whether vaccines effective? know wouldn’t. US government can't that. money going come from? temper tantrums say thank continue inside. ITT: one reading anyone else's comments. much this. Covid fatigue real setting in. **real** disinformation coming America, Russia China. 

It America goes around claiming covid like flu. 

It America goes around claiming hydroxychloroquine cure covid. 

It America claiming vaccine available November. 

Has China Russia made claims? study COVID-19 disinformation **the United States America** leading sponsor disinformation biased untrustworthy. Stop believing anything say. letting guys know. new thing. done pneumonia vaccines elderly bleeding risk patients now. hit nail head emotion based decisions vs logical based decisions. There's massive sustained push hack people's emotions virus led absolutely bizarre policies. Every time look data wonder translates see happening around me, think, ahh, that's right, there's sort election coming one side fumbled ball pretty hard last 4 years. Honestly, media continue push narrative? I’ve seen many articles follow story - “you never go back happy pre pandemic life”.

I found article came along pretty ominous, threatening messages; “*Accept current reality*”. “*Let go fantasies expectations*”. 

Listen, understand idea buying time there’s vaccine. understand wearing mask there’s vaccine. understand going concerts, weddings, etc. there’s sort vaccine. obviously, we’re going return makes us happy. aren’t going stay like forever, even next 3 years. really don’t understand media outlets tying get publishing crazy articles...  Right, intentionally misrepresenting says push politically-driven agenda. point. like idea much. trigger conservative extended family can't share views. could make echo chamber even worse.

The problem lies personal algorithm customized feeds. Every user forced 'alternate reality,' profits :( sad. I'll suppository please. nice arm sore injection sight too! avoid opening everything might infect john infects bob infects kills grandma. people got elevator buttons feel like super power now. Didn’t realize getting blood drawn difficult people. home blood test times before. Essentially requires stab draw 20+ drops blood onto special card five circles need soaked completely. well dropped people's minds. hence people stupid dumb fuck ""rallies"" virus LOL. You’ve never basic training lol, don’t think first 4 shots would hurt nurse doctor gave them, military people jam in, needle longer visible. get peanut butter shot... Get this, rumored family, holland?! hopefully vaccine soon avoid shut Weird say thank go in. Exactly! It’s necessary economy tourism-centric countries Professional asshole. Source that? I'm impression vaccines, like modern medicines health treatments, necessity tested animals they're allowed anywhere near humans read article? family care father physically anymore. remained engaged life move facility.

I'm stuck position family, physical way could care mother. I've injured back lifting/caring many times past. first floor bathroom/shower could use (or bedroom), equipment hoist onto toilet, bed, chair wheel chair, hospital bed. Nothing house would accommodate living here. three children care working/schooling home. And, would get care family contracted virus? literally impossible situation. mention, in-laws also dire health situation may well line care get sick. Like families predicament, We've thought every possible angle suck. “Probably” hell basing assumption think may typo there...

I self isolating kids exposed covid STILL caught cold (tested neg covid), believe talking neighbours fence like ten feet away. Starting 🆕 Karen 💻 Brighton. !emojify I'm disappointed person role resorts using fictive numbers argumentation. Completely agree. problem happens CR general. Doctors specialists stay within scope medicine tend advise people issues basic knowledge about..

But yeah, even GP kids pediatrician opinions COVID19, unfortunately people generally view doctors specialists, take word it. I’ve heard times something like “my doctor says it’s big deal it’s blown proportion”. Netherlands worse everyone else. Masks work virus spread aerosol. Naive dumb question: good thing? implications weakened immune systems threat even strong flu season 2022? fact many people upvoted frankly ludicrous comment worrying, genuinely think entire planet get 3% globe die? 
Seriously it’s barley touched south Saharan Africa due young somewhat healthy population talking Canada r/NFL turning r/Coronavirus fat slob like Christie beat corona, anyone can. 

Silver lining. Thats lie. head netherlands said masks dont work. causes confusion. didnt say that, we'd fine someone hates needles im board this. white family got week school started. Neighbours kids 😣 Oh I’m sorry loss grandma live end life away loved ones. Truly heartbreaking. fear situation soon well comment shook :-((( look punishing coach even calling Zika brain get it. Surely important thing world right now, one thing something about? classic prisoner's dilemma, capitalism cannot cope with. world becomes globalised importance individual diminishes, collectivist societies thrive.

This ""new Asian century"". Ah, good old Dutch Reformed. I’ve town, Sunday things open churches. downvoting you? bed wetters don’t like science? 
Every credible epidemiologist said IRF one percent zero point four percent Dr Oz Eradication means zero dude Moderators: told mod team allowed thread, since White House outbreak, overall pandemic response policy decisions pandemic started onward.  folks report hotel brands social media? Make clear list guests enforcing 3?????????????? serious? 3?????? ?? way extinction.

It starting sink in, see.

Countries went extinction thriving. Countries believed vaccine fata morgana suffering.

Also, think 5 years road, NZ, China, Vietnam, Singapore etc still corona free. want trade us? Nope. Unless takes exterminate virus all. even trying say? ""Slightly""??  one past jobs faking car starting would worked. lost grandma couple weeks ago (not coronavirus). assisted living facility. could talk windows masks on. last 4 months life get single hug 7 children 40 grand/great grand children allowed in. rough time family. opinion space set aside situations like (if possible) would allow least immediate family give last loving embrace help people pass love loneliness. ignorant opinion, simply can’t lock nation population poverty levels India.
It wasn’t government incompetence economic necessity survival. long term lockdown would worse Indian people. I’m related someone thinks things like this. I’m one texts talks every day. one else stand her.

She idea I’m vaxxer. talk every day isn’t smart enough simply ask. sends sorts Instagram screenshots videos “doctors” absolutely trying take advantage her. 

I kids. They’re young, home schooled, sick, don’t chance life long mother continues this. never disagree anything unless it’s serious. 

That means nip harmful ideas gets right bud. Someday, kids might need help. want feel like always someone turn to.

It’s absolutely disheartening exhausting. tries hard good mom. would be, weren’t psychopaths trying take advantage someone isn’t smart enough know better. explain real science her, can’t keep attention long enough (20 seconds) sink in. remains confused, scared. Actually right freedom religion extend allowing beat children religion says (or anything else believe). 

HOWEVER different constitutional right PREVENTS beating children, people general: article 11 dutch constitution says anyone right inviolability body. Meaning one allowed physically hurt without consent. 

And one abide laws, one. Plugging new David Attenborough doc Netflix climate change anyone painkillers light article might hope. type chronical pain potentially treated research outcomes. cancer, amputees (?) people partial muscle necrosis etc.

just amount people opioids alarming, imagine treating pain without possible threat addiction... 

and yes, really hope least bad things Cov-19 caused could changed positive effects future. Brazil almost excess deaths covid deaths declared. excess deaths US much worse. always report like instead 3 7 day rolling average? Bigger numbers better headlines? one day statistic actually useful? question Vitamin important, personally follow medical guidelines this.

I even curious see Calcifediol trial outcomes scale, hampered incomplete adjustment confounding factors.
But then, get hopes one factor among many. ""might well let commit terror acts bc mij rights""
Theres honestly much stupid comment giving migrain. Flumist thing years though think majority people know inhaled vaccs Haha wow, least autocorrect clitoris guess. Uh, referring this: “Description: chemtrail conspiracy theory posits erroneous belief long-lasting condensation trails ""chemtrails"" consisting chemical biological agents left sky high-flying aircraft, sprayed nefarious purposes undisclosed general public. Wikipedia” Cloris Bleachman? One way another, we're ruined, know yet.

Remember politicians this. exactly true. lot damage (if damage) unique covid19. look damaged heart, damaged way know permanent need wait years. cause damage change that.

We know full numbers obviously, but, dumb question. Reddit say science know theyre corrupt through. Yeah fuck no, people back didn’t “man up” anyone dared show form reluctance battlefield shot, people suffered lot chose pretend remember fairy tale propaganda. terrorist act would conflict different constitutional right (inviolability ones body) therefore terrorists can't hide behind right freedom religion. 

I however agree completely idiotic kind gatherings still happening Netherlands. Donald Trump. Biden publicly committed America join international COVAX program help poor countries access vaccine? Science opinion people country. Sadly. Freedoms important public health government enforce anything. Even quarantine testing positive advised. mandatory. Ciboire de tabarnak! point still stands. Errands means food, necessities, etc. us high riskers take care things go public unless government going give us handouts, thus importance everyone responsible unlike OP. surprise things thanks distancing, hand washing, cleaning hand gel eveywhere etc.

A doctor UK said back March thanks people simply washing hands decrease colds, flu, tonsillitis, dodgy tummys etc... right.

The awareness washing hands more, touching faces wearing masks etc absolutely reduced casual sicknesses. Me? I'll stick huffing Cloris brand bleach. Can't catch coronavirus lining lungs melted. US needs vaccines home. probably surplus export mid-2021 earliest.

China population 4 times larger United States. mention China developing country advanced America is. 

What means America China going able vaccine people exporting countries. Yet, China still willing join global initiative help rest world vaccines. world asking America step show leadership? people deduce risk support epidemic control stats 10 year old Africans. Sarcasm Please remember countries testing more, prioritising people symptoms/close contacts testing.  


We much different situation Spring. I'm saying bad, will, can't compare went through, even testing back then.  


On seperate note, would take information USA pinch salt, see comments like 'that's X % highest daily number X State' yeah Murica, please remember government encouraging hiding case numbers such, let's compare comparible please! called statospheric aerosol injections literally google it. thing. anti-vaxx, everything dumb tinfoils say necessarily false Redundant article. cites couple midwestern states, cites stories Fla.

...because everyone surrounding already it. Exactly. lockdown long enough exterminate virus option. give drug, it. useful dexamethasone, actually saves lives, ill. 60k? Yes, person assistance. Right now, “in person assistance” means sending back school buildings despite pandemic.

If society really cared, (which doesn’t) would working make online learning effective possible given circumstances. would argue many special education students trusted person aid assist home time.

Instead probably send everybody back buildings it’s cheaper easier, play daily Russian roulette virus... second wave Europe going get nasty. really scares keeps toes public. risk dying (I'm 20s - I'm going die this) shit happens heart lungs afterward.

That says really. government never people's side. always burden best, oppressor worst. authority implement anti corona measures people actually follow them. first thought : wait didnt italy peak march became hotspot? 5000+ cases everyday then? feel normal/underwhelming now......

Another news iran: 

TEHRAN, Iran — Iran announced highest single-day death toll coronavirus — 251.

Health Ministry spokesperson Sima Sadat Lari said Sunday Iran’s total death toll COVID-19 stands 28,544, making Iran hardest-hit country region. It’s previous daily high deaths 239 came four days earlier.

Officials reported 3,822 newly confirmed coronavirus infections past 24 hours, raising total pandemic 500,075. Among recently infected head Iran’s atomic energy organization, latest senior official test positive virus.

The government largely resisted imposing widescale lockdowns economy teeters continued U.S. economic sanctions effectively bar Iran selling oil internationally. Iran’s currency plunged lowest level ever Sunday. make mosquitoes deliver it. die immediately, everyone done. haven’t, got one last week. lot people simply aren’t educated US, specifically comes proper diets, literally invest every way keep uneducated eating shit.

No, Europe need adopt authoritarianism. Well okay guess that's settled.  requires authorization emergency use whereas dexamethasone given freely using steroids multiple ailments COVID know works. 

To answer question, yes used. prescribed patient last night. part, anyone hospitalized gets consented it.

this assuredly position WHO. much obvious anyone read things puts out.

Diwnvoted something would uncontroversially acceptable statement make many years ago (well, maybe many years ago, I'm old). TEHRAN, Iran — Iran announced highest single-day death toll coronavirus — 251.

Health Ministry spokesperson Sima Sadat Lari said Sunday Iran’s total death toll COVID-19 stands 28,544, making Iran hardest-hit country region. It’s previous daily high deaths 239 came four days earlier.

Officials reported 3,822 newly confirmed coronavirus infections past 24 hours, raising total pandemic 500,075. Among recently infected head Iran’s atomic energy organization, latest senior official test positive virus.

The government largely resisted imposing widescale lockdowns economy teeters continued U.S. economic sanctions effectively bar Iran selling oil internationally. Iran’s currency plunged lowest level ever Sunday. problem assholes planet... aka anti vaxxers Students teachers classroom , spread virus virus deadly difficult understand ? aren’t #1, haven’t quite time Wait get microchip int us then?? also calculate time people lose fighting bills economic drain US’ healthcare “system” unbelievable. what's real number? 300K, 350K? sort way - good things skin belong skin. start panicking get splinter calm - used days stand wearing earrings. Doctors assumed afraid pain injections blood draws would always say ""you'll barely feel it!"" issue. finally explained one doctor pain, needle skin, actually went easier - stopped trying reassure going hurt started giving updates like ""2 seconds!"" may may control issues ... updates settle right passed since started explaining myself. know going end, countdown keeps focused calm.

Aside needle issues, also hopeful inhaled vaccine. doctor thinks sensitivity preservatives additives injections - usually run fevers get body aches pretty miserable days. mean, injection far superior option, let's go - worth days feeling like hell protect community - cake eat too? Sweet! worked Contagion Hehehe also tell stop living fear. Ask wear seatbelts car. 

If use carseat baby, tell stop living fear tell anecdotal story carseat baby FINE.

See like it. country democratic vote, decide whether use Chinese vaccine not. way, people Country X decide trust Chinese vaccine, China stop sending vaccines country. 

After all, hypocrite publicly question Chinese vaccine, privately take anyway. Loud wrong. France’s positivity rate twice high America’s. want propagate conspiracy theories impressionable Reddit crowd, need try little harder. Aaaand anti-vaxxers become chemtrails conspiracists, although I'm sure there's overlap already. seriously good idea though, vaccine administered exponential rate injections. I'm Bozeman, people continuing completely moronic here. never disappointed people life.

I work part-time retail location people routinely ignore mask requirements walk ask us, ""Are masks required here?"" whine us bother put one ask. 

My favorites ones walk holding mask hand never actually anything useful it. Science based numbers data . Provide numbers show students teachers killed Someone know compared ""stomach flu"" said bad once. Europe needs adopt political system China, quickly defeated virus. need tough government measures. I'm surprised would take time unkind someone even know internet. Thanks making feel bad something wrote thought funny. Feel better now? purpose curbing spread hospitals get overwhelmed give proper care people.

And yeah, country worked really well. vaccines less effective “non-live” vaccines needed “live” order create proper immune response.

Although I'm doctor biologist, I'm pretty sure vaccine intranasal mean live vaccine.

For example, [flu vaccines intranasal bunch different COVID-19 vaccine efforts underway right now, article mention live vaccines, think article trying address general idea intranasal vaccines COVID-19.

I'm sure currently live virus intranasal vaccine worked COVID-19, even not, seems pretty clear going second generation vaccines, could future. possible summer months fatalities less this? don't, fuck you. 25000 people day die hunger. give shit. hits rich westerners suddenly care. bigger hypocrites. school district open little 2 months, first semester ended. border 2 states AZ/UT real issues school. almost 3k kids child's campus middle high school 3 cases none tied school (caught home), kids sitting near contact rapid test negative. child thinks maybe kids ""stayed home"" say anything positive, seem spread? Ifeel safe child school worrying first . child super happy back class real learning long high school kids stay school ready college? actually East coast ended desert mom retired here. child back be, would person school year. child takes AP level classes dreams good college can't learn science labs languages practice music online (or working us, bad internet, kids showing up, teachers knowing do).

My main concern live high school kids , many attend local college classes, high school kids attend healthcare classes seniors become CNAs work nursing homes. kind scary, kids attend high schools morning work nursing homes later day. Normally awesome program help kids get healthcare careers risky now.  Tbh propable gave nurse real vaccine he'd possibilities exposed virus started wearing last week. People still look weird haha. ...Why can't be? get send quicker hospital and/or ICU Germany. so, much capacity allow people get intensive care even cases mild. Hospital beds ICUs much rarer resource Netherlands kept free possible. Belgium called city defensive wall feudal times. official rule really. yeah.. better.. (in helsinki). nowhere near ""good"" - especially we've got higher infection rate compared peak april/may 1st wave...

maybe 1/20 public transport (enough usually see couple masks per carriage) - many days without local transmissions? disagree this. democracy isn’t messed partisanship ruled ineptly could also deal this. $100 fine you’re caught wearing mask even wearing one correctly. Subsequent offenses $500, $1000, month jail. Guaranteed you’d widespread compliance. America stuck divided half population warped view freedom. Possibly close seems.

The US undercounts 30%, likely lot Brazil, seen proper excess death analysis whole country thing Spain. I’m sorry happened you. swine flu too. Newsflash: exactly happened every country developed world. Yes it’s still peripheral issue. central. Exactly. Nothing really ""cure"" viral infection, except one's immune system. antibody treatment neutralizes large number viruses body, drastically slowing course infection, thus buying time patient's adaptive immune response kicks start produce antibodies own. Hey baby, listen. want grant herd immunity. None, really. Knocking population US 324 million achieve anything beyond burning doctors grave diggers. Even higher estimate 5% ifr services overwhelmed triage: population reduction 313 million would make difference 'the world' country. guys important. Also argentina many countries latin america, maybe masks help little they're equivalent hazmat suits people sub think Right except “a months” already half year people starting say gonna need keep end 2021. kind comparison compare ww2? things even shittier past young people means dont get complain situation now? hope never complained feeling well people year 1100 dying bubonic plague automatically invalidates feelings Broadly socialist yes, politics decidedly centrist due reliance support parties get stuff parliament. 

Social democrats confused regular old socialists even democratic socialists since much believe power capitalism tries balance large social programs. Even Green Party (MP) sometimes left Social Democratic Party(SAP). studies? far know study proving masks work outside laboratory settings, report 2019 suggests masks prevent spread flu, would work coronavirus? Imagine thinking corporate elites leftist. Pure unfiltered psychosis. need help. Finland Norway better Sweden TBH yet always ignored people prop 'Swedish model'. 2 month lockdown, trade initial surge resulted less cases/deaths per capita. Moreover, unlike Sweden, two countries place elderly care homes extended lockdown till mid-Sep.

Post-lockdown, people countries similar restrictions (namely social distancing group size limits) economies hit GDP fell 8.6% second quarter year, according statistics fall sharper neighbors — Denmark registered 7.4% fall, Finland 3.2% fall. Statistics suggest Norway also fared better Sweden.

Also, plenty post-lockdown countries using similar measures Sweden. Namely, enforcing social distancing, recommending working home additionally mask mandates. Again, difference lockdown afforded countries ability flatten curves sooner mitigate impact initial surge.

For reference:

Cases - - This, exactly. I'm RN, I've minimal exposure Covid patients work inpatient geropsych we've worked hard keep Covid unit. figure risk daily activities unit test prior admission concerning symptoms. Ah, got confused. always get confused words lockdown masks. biggest problem see unwillingness close bars limit family events. That’s everyone know got infected. Also 0 tracing. need leave details bar restaurant. Things work like here. Yes that’s literally said? I’m sure you’re trying prove . India also like 4x population. would shocker don’t end deaths especially cases landslide Del Taco starts $15 extra night shifts, retail starts $15 &amp; up. place pack good shipment, kind like amazon warehouse local smaller companies start $16 &amp; up. kids March August worked crazy overtime too. son friends starting college worked summer made 1k week. able bodied would work outside (it hot) landscaping, concrete, digging , entry level construction, money great 1k+ week, even packed boxes inside worked assembly could make $800+ week. 18 lots youth faclities wilderness programs, pay well watching troubled teens, controversy tied them? course college age mind crazy shifts, late nights, overnights, early mornings. adjust playing video games around it. lockdown totally ineffective. real problem bars, restaurants family events. Everyone know got infected got one these. won’t actually anything want spend money pay unemployed give cheap loans businesses pay rent etc.

Numbers already dropping nothing g measures. It’s political BS. Recommend, require masks.

We don’t need restrictions fight flu. are, close though. Two top ten worst countries world basically Gyms never openned there? source relatives could meet outside nursing homes? (In Germany, could meet inside. Even though every floor - usually ground level)

I acknowledge Sweden big plus letting children age 14 school. always main difference Sweden Germany: Sweden young kids provided for, 5 times dead. Difficult judge. (Germany never real lockdown - always allowed go outside. point often stretched necessary mental health)

GDP [much better comparison direct (I find comparisons including Spain Italy always fruitless way different society)

And can't find source, consumer spending also way down, like 25%, compared neighbours 29%. leaving stores open help much (We Germans ordered online like crazy)

What also find lacking ""Let's like Sweden""-people: compare Swedish society others. Swedens asked travel less, IMO likely follow it. ask German Americans travel less, conclude ""It's banned, it!"". Swedes more....voluntary solidarity?

EDIT: Political demonstrations never rely well-meaning police. demonstrate important right, never something granted police. also demonstrations initially banned - people sued way it, supported (though cause protest corona-measures ;-) Flu vaccine isn’t always totally effective, regardless that’s original point discussed anyway. Masks effective flu, current COVID restrictions happen also helpful flu. 

It’s suggestion lock seasonal flu. flu still kills LOT people. 
 hear people say things like ""just bad flu"" dismissive statement always think WTF. flu deadly virus, soo....if like bad flu like extra deadly virus. ever been? math you: That's USA 245,000 cases  wife leaves Madrid every morning. far checks leaving Madrid. ppl know get harassed town. allowed move around inside Madrid. police lies pretends even allowed leave neighbourhood. True, guess relevant info would important include article.  Hammer virus low prevalence, set nationwide test track quarantine system, get population buy masks, distancing l, hygiene.  It’s hard, obviously China, NZ, SK, etc it’s achievable. virus hide inside people's bodies.

You need get light bodies! Well enough.

If wear mask wash regularly (most don't). Also virus spreads also contact. wear gloves too.  incredibly detailed information testing, contact tracing, mitigation, informing public. even got taxi driver's license plate number warn potential people might come contact. span 2 days. tell much work put many people protocols mobilized soon positive results found.

It's really like dream handle there. God wish could here. Viral myocarditis uncommon mild cases usually resolve 6 months. Severe cases lead permanent damage death. reality countries unable handle it. Given work chance place like India Mexico Peru going contain thing? really don’t think so. Wealthy countries failed deserve blame. Middle tier countries like Brazil deserve blame willfully ignorant leaders were. countries really little chance compare ? 🤣 strange symptoms though , fever lacking taste ... believe worse US per capita basis. suppose key part 'true'... flu’s particles small masks won’t able trap Yep. Let’s ban people. I’m even sarcastic. vaccines seasonal flu, making masks redundant placebo group speeds things tiny bit. Wait wait, didn’t say sarcastic?? it? Pick one. equivalent US reporting like 245,000 cases day would insane. possible, unless want people starve riot, consequences second lockdown would tragical. First lockdown put Europe's economy 10 years behind, second would send countries default, would course lead political consequences well, election radical far right movements power on, that's France lockdown nobody Europe will. course 'killing 1% population' bad, lockdown, Healthcare system would collapse. cases requires hospitalization would simply end dead. would 'killing 20% population' bad. Asia would happened, given medical attention immediately instead waiting home can't walk anymore, reach phone ambulance.

That's happens aim zero-COVID. get 20% from? according wikipedia 57,662 hospitalizations nyc, around 2 million people infected according serology surveys hospitalization rate would 2.88%  think reality, flu 0.06 - 0.1% COVID 0.3-0.6%. logical explanation 0.01% clearly impossible. Hmm, informative /s.

A chart regions done and/or continue generally badly. Sweden looks somewhat better. 

But ""For perspective"", where's chart Sweden's nearest neighbors, Finland Norway? perhaps actual nations successful responses, like Taiwan, New Zealand, Thailand, Vietnam? Heck, chart even European nation bit better side, like Germany? 

Some perspective. Yes, yes think that. crazy real. Yeah ridiculous. trying get partner NZ year offshore visa getting processed, massively contradicting info INZ. ended leaving NZ month ago, lucky privileged so, that's option many people separated families. suck probably able go home least year two. Ridiculous understatement. Swedish case numbers rising everyone else. still say it’s ok use primary method.  Yes. That’s condemning them. clearly says situations (last resort) used. He’s merely saying shouldn’t primary control method. totally agree. it’s condemning them. don’t believe uses word himself. That’s incorrect editorializing. effective would vaccine side effects?

The reason large scale clinical trials 'it worked me' attitude likely get many people killed. got coronavirus, totally okay either risking coworkers getting virus, would let fire shrug off, telling deserved it?


EDIT- Fuck butchered that. Sure, chopped France continent put middle ocean spent couple decades disentangling economy rest Europe. 2020 weird year. NZ beat coronavirus wallabies ;) probably write one soon. Fear culture. Police stage checks media goverment saying 7.500 police officers stoping everyone leaves enter Madrid without good reason. 

And really like dozens police checks option either expensive much bother them.

All hope people scared enough stay home. always mildly amusing/mildly infuriating pediatrician tells ""mild"" anti-vaxxers hear outbreak town rush get children vaccinated. already? Millions loosing businesses jerbs getting high medical bill corona treatment.
All world events canceled... 

How much need go people realize... fuck. getting annoyed srsly.

You know moment calling BS watch zombie movie see person getting bit hides willingly traps rest group...

Yeah seems like realistic all... Sigh. want god damn doors opened enjoy planet fucking morons prolonging openings making everything worse -.-

Edit: however Dutch many evangelicals. Christians still Dutch thus straightforward expect anything free, even God.  rates still quite low versus early year exactly said. Maybe read carefully next time. rates surging. Look graph January rather relying headlines. Look slope first wave slope now. Sweden's case rates increasing quite steadily see death rates look like weeks now. told weeks ago Sweden's lack case increases proof policies work. Well look cases increasing too. Turns every country stage pandemic. Yes Sweden's death rates lower well. trend across world due improved treatment. magnitude difference Spain much larger though. There's never one factor public health medicine. simple enough understand. studies already showing war masks specific situations much less severe disease versus face shields nothing all. fact. one thing anti-masker hillbilly US argue public health official Sweden... well vast majority 10% young, IFR much lower, dragging average down.

If virus hit people 20-30's, IFR would 0.001%. hit nursing homes, would 20%. country's IFR mostly result demographics. Oh getting started. history repeats itself, like historically does, digging mass graves outside cities. That's people flu say corona virus......ever since CV every illness seems like exist reinforces beliefs since start covid taken seriously we've ultimately ruined economy nothing. 5 years old first world purchasing power dream model based endless consumption. So, dense selfcentered promoted west decades Wife got trip Christmas came JFK airport. mask mandate coincided several actions headline neglected mention. right freedom religion extend anything believe. religion says beat children (as Bible does), still allowed child protection laws.

Nobody stopping believing whatever like, abide laws country (which Bible says do).

The real reason church get enough money people church. So, money. That's great news. Make sure keep wearing masks hospitals get jammed up, people covid non-covid issues still get treatment. hypothetically really needed call “sick” tomorrow work, study fail online midterm. What’s best way raise covid alarms get tested skip work longer?  guess Europe, right? mean 'mainly'? European countries? majority European countries? think minority believes in? 

At first, depends heavily country. European countries highly Christian, others, like e.g. Netherlands, majority atheists, somewhat 50%, 43% Christians. countries Europe Christianity present. countries majority atheists make Europe 'mainly atheist'. countries secular, religion politics separated, make atheist either. Lol. seriously claiming users sub downplaying virus? Sorry cannot imagine pain. However, infectious virus, unless everyone around also agrees rather die Covid loneliness, much one do.

Besides: need correct use (I see much incorrect use) need maintain social distance addition wearing them.
The point medical professionals use masks therefor work partly valid, since people use medical masks. protection still limited diy regular masks lack filtering. temporary. saying masks keeping death rates low. death rates surging despite Spain mask policies since June places. maybe stop moving goal posts. Sweden also higher deaths per capita spring now. Here's full timeline: No

Yes

No herd immunity opt sweden, believe reddit trolls Hopefully move Korean model good job keeping lid virus wothout nuking economy. feel bad parties involved.

Could placebo Simple speed matters lot. Korea confirmed cases per capita wide margin government jumped hard February. aghast seeing country country things government done even weeks warning compared us. Trump's re-election? Okay, messaging confusing inconsistent. Plus NZ, Taiwan combine Relative deaths earlier year. pull daily deaths per capita January stop disingenuous. first wave peaked 18 per million. Look slope first wave slope second wave. Sink islands become new Atlantis! ""Due constitutional right freedom religion, government unable force churches limit number churchgoers 30.""

EU approved 1,8 trillion euro pandemic relief fund assigned countries; wonder took biggest bite it. Similar story Korea. Korea different model NZ track trace system that's worked well keeping virus without nuking economy work many cases. Schools needed babysit, otherwise parents can't work, collapse economy. 

There interest stopping spread slowing it, long hospital capacity deaths acceptable enough keep economy limping along.

Decisions made money, lives. American here: completely dissatisfied we've handled it. could easily numbers way lower Whatever China publishes, add 3 zeroes. actually 600 billion trips 20,000 music festivals.

The worrying part epidemic, eventually end epidemic. worrying part expect societies scenario climate change requires drastic changes way life even wearing mask becomes problem. compare Sweden's immediate neighbours? Also, per capita numbers easily extrapolated considering Sweden twice population two countries. double numbers Finland/Norway, still see fared much better. main point Sweden took far longer flatten curve compared neighbors graphs clearly show it.

[**Volunteer Tested New Oxford Vaccine Astrazeneca Tested Positive alarming countries chosen ""suppression"" approach... which, ideally, *every* country, know. vaccine provide sterilizing immunity, there's always risk people die. person turns non-placebo group, looks like countries going keep mitigation measures, like social distancing masks, well release vaccine, consistent experts Fauci Offit saying.

Technically they'd get die covid-19 lonely. :( natural, optimist wish future better, worse. quite convinced going “back” Yeah hey hope government needs done. I'm expert, can't say what's best. lock down, evening clock wearing masks. care honestly. part complying hopefully get numbers down. countries implemented masks usage much sooner. already widely known masks help prevent spreading.

Regardless Governor says, there’s reason ease restrictions time. matter fact restrictions likely tighten even Election Day, seeing likely national scale super spreader event. Yep, literally news. Guy idea whether real vaccine not. enforcing them

People Europe longer care.

This entirely surprising. light end tunnel. Immunity lasts months vaccines make difference, virus airborne masks largely ineffective, governments proven incompetent unwilling take crisis, therefore people seem thinking everyone going get anyway delay inevitable hunker get next year.

Most all, country (Belgium) trust government low hardly anyone cares anything say regards corona. Even corona tracing app flop government. they? Corona wreck health there's nothing says ever back normal. play around shit. China. enough medical face-masks protect everybody...saying proof longer valid argument, considering medical personnel wearing decades prevent infection...

The question is: still debating effectiveness non-medical face-masks? prioritize worldwide production medical face-masks all? People decided care. Nothing nothing less. effects people personally care. account obese people going much? forgot people got shot dead heights BLM. OK, Guayaquil April graphs add Germany? Don’t forget use per capita numbers like graphs posted. take supplements around 1000iu day, it’s hard know get naturally, may 2500iu don’t want much like geometric growth Good luck enjoy freedom able go out. Funny way say, misinterpreted comment ok. discussed? follow local news much keep eye sabah numbers due family friends sweden conservative administration currently?

We US focus seems preserving business income. (Or maybe sweden letting scientists determine policy? curious, so, they'd opt herd immunity). Right regarded certain outbreaks stem public interaction private parties gatherings. Public mask wearing pretty solid, even Berlin. seen two people without masks stores since April, mandatory. people wearing noses feel smug tricking taking mask later. though.

Masks much seems wearing prevents infections public transport shopping. diffuse background activity, meaning localized peaks cases like beginning, cause concern precautions (such large gatherings indoors without masks). People pretty much keep partying like summer hundred cases day. brings cases up, people gathering groups ignoring distancing mask wearing. already got it, asymptomatic, spread whole family, asymptomatic. Family full smokers, except children.

And dude, live US, Brazil numbers high, even then, things look critical. freak out. course, try get it, get it, there's really nothing it.

China uh well lot faults covid, family literally traveling around China vacations covid pretty well contained— contact tracing insane there.... gotta love authoritarian governments unnerving amount access citizens data.... poorly worded, first read thread title little quick, thought said ...patient respiratory *system* suffers brain damage. 

and first thought was...""well, *duh*"". not, feels like people do. would much like wake tomorrow over. still smarter you, stay threatened Hate thought something even deadlier contagious. worry ignorance really making look like dumb American. coma 1945 woke up? bad thing poorer countries many sufficient resources provide oxygen support. Even Rural India real problem. could push fatality rate much higher 0.6%. don’t get all. helix sent 400k tests, they’ve done 64582 send report multiple times? 64582 records duplicates rest records never documented? Legit asking. swear y’all actually want US cases deaths trump doesn’t get another term agree you. case store source dimensions merge data. need kind extra work pit recovery possible since data sources restored. yeah assume build without dims. “new normal?” I’m going abide it. Thanks I’ve saying! It’s popular, people can’t wrap minds around yet, don’t want to. 2021 fucked year was, possibly so. remember can't justify cheap immigrant labor without shortage workers. humanity gone, guess apes elephants could devolvd that, doubt it. 

If Americans gone, don’t think much would change, force good couple generations. slow normal Spring time. Summer/Fall real shit kicks in! God playing Pandemic isnt happy first run. Hold on, mean tell CHOSE go there? HAHAHA... People tend lose inhibitions drink. Putting trump, Fauci Cuomo sentence incompetent like trump? propaganda pushing? estimate I've seen used months experts trust. also agrees antibody prevalence studies vs fatalities Spain New York. HIV can’t fuck everybody room once. (With rare exceptions usually caught film.)

I agree. understand difference. guess forgot blood transfusions ways getting HIV. case, bad comparison. inject Oh, speaking specifically hydroxychloroquinine, symptoms someone expect recover COVID-19!! misunderstood you!

[When hydroxychloroquinine double-blind placebo tested efficacy COVID University Minnesota medical school, showed benefit compared one date able reproduce Henry Ford Health System's study double-blind placebo--doctors selected patients rejected others reasons unknown, fact, patients taking drugs steroids time, would potentially corrupt results.

You want patients receiving exact treatment exception one group getting nothing Covid (the control group), one group getting hydroxychloroquinine, one group getting sugar pill. researchers would know who, outside control group, would receiving drug. patients doctors would know.

It noted double-blind placebo study Minnesota came Henry Ford Health's study. Henry Ford story news Trump made big deal early study saying vindicated topic hydroxychloroquinine.

Trump seemed agree Fauci given Hydroxycholoroquinine Walter Reed diagnosed COVID-19.

But I've talking happens COVID-19 patient, symptoms experience recover, happens post-recovery. Patients observed continued difficulty breathing, elevated cardiac problems reduced mental capacities even recovering virus.

Studies aggregate patient responses experienced COVID-19 can't ever placebo controlled, testing particular drug placebo would made: they're recording patients experiencing post-recovery. 

Again, studies aggregate patient recovery experiences can't double-blind placebo, testing specific drug. tabulating statistics received, previously asked ""long-term statistics"" gish-galloping ""double-blind"" argument, apply general patient outcome post-COVID statistics, unless specifically studying specific drug, weren't.

The current aggregated statistical evidence shows people diagnosed COVID-19 recover show reduced respiratory, cardiac mental abilities. Whether specific treatments improve patient outcome remains seen, drug testing take time.

Now, explain placebo COVID virus neither patient doctor knows symptomatic patient COVID aggregates recovery responses, I'd interested hear it. fact, published paper that, likely win Nobel prize medicine would truly amazing set experiment would test patients experienced symptoms moderate severe COVID, neither patient doctor would allowed know patient ever COVID. Would willing volunteer study might get COVID virus might get placebo ""virus"" would make sick COVID (including loss smell taste) give COVID antibodies? placebo virus would created experiment suggest. Otherwise would trivial determine symptomatic COVID placebo, negating double-blind study.

Since COVID part SARS family viruses rely airborne droplets transmitted, masks reduce spread droplets. masks reduce spread more. powerful experiment done show much less spread mask. double-blind placebo, subjects knew wearing wearing masks. I'm sure agree would impossible make double-blind neither patient doctor would know patient wearing particular, watch 42 second video. demonstrates droplet spread without mask.

When Fauci talking ""flawed,"" specifically talking Henry Ford Health hydroxychloroquinine study, read remarks, says double-blind randomized placebo studies gold standard determining *if drug effective.* 

To extrapolate Fauci claimed every single scientific study ever randomized double-blind placebo would incorrect extrapolation, quite possibly could deliberately done attempt obfuscate confuse, attempt call liar.

Remdesivir (which Trump took) double-blind placebo studied [and shown effective haven’t done since April. ""Sorry hear live Mainland.""

On hand, case nosocomial spread hospital heads roll ala Harbin.  Trump wants US catch Covid, get brain damage vote. Pretty clever way get people vote him. /s people paying big bucks sit front plane comfortable seats, crappy seats back would cost bunch already do. think 2.8 100 people die, need help. confirm. coronavirus. Get flu pretty steadily every year, pnuemonia. Covid knocked ass. Tuesday night, getting bed said boyfriend 'I think I'm getting sick, maybe I'll go doctors tomorrow.' Wednesday morning, went work felt little chilly, left lunch doctors. Doctor said, without examining taking tests, may coming pnuemonia history. Told pick mucinex head home, didnt even make sense, really tired went home. night, body sore weak couldnt walk bathroom. couldnt get air gulping. thirsty, water felt like needles sandpaper dry throat. boyfriend stayed awake might thought going choke sleep. went hospital next day stayed two weeks. never felt much pressure chest, much trouble breathing, incredible dont wish upon anyone. pneumonia reclassified as, think 20,000 hidden COVID deaths. 

As usual, data way behind time, estimate around 10,000 unacknowledged deaths.

Which would put ~0.125% PFR, Connecticut. No. Why? 

Does science says president needs negative tests two days row? Ugh, think I'd prefer invasion white walkers point. Trump like building walls...... Good idea, arsewipes! Thankfully university president responded within hours saying plan keep limiting attendance. yeah you’re right, people dumb. Yes. virus contagious, yes. hasnt *he* dieted yet? I'll tell truth now: everyone NC caught it, would typical death rate, population would still continue grow year year dang influx yankees. Hey, remember cases Italy summer? deaths like US? times President Italy downplayed virus? neither. Jesus I'm sure capable spouting rhetoric confronted facts borne data, notice go silent? retort reality, distort fit worldview. They're sports fan tout team title several times 40 years ago, ignoring they've awful ever since. Ironically, they're exactly like University Florida football fans. That’s peak douche, like don’t know handle douche captain! ...Or, Faucci started saying masks useless, everyone told lockdown social distance, BLM protests everywhere apparently wasn’t issue despite lack masks distancing. 

It beyond farcical hypocritical Americans are, hyperbole fascists. It’s silly. Real talk America, you’re acting like spoiled petulant child, sides political shit show are.

The simple fact sides want hypocritically blame never take responsibility guaranteed civil war. I’m starting agree this. point millions would hearing ALOT long hauling seems smaller minority forums support groups make out. 

On personal note. happen infection. Someone close lost hearing one childhood infection. Never got back healthy otherwise. 

These things happen sounds like coach speak. knows President Fuchs AD Stricklin aren’t going lift restrictions. also known bullshit asymmetry principle, internet adage emphasizes difficulty debunking bullshit: ""The amount energy needed refute bullshit order magnitude bigger produce it.""

So avoid wasting ton time, provide proof bullshit? Prove bullshit assertions gtfo. Wikipedia preferred. According article going take extra day. sound bad. I’ve wondered tone days (in Corps) regarding social issues. got 2012 still much huge anti-sjw circle jerk, least time 1/6. get cases going up. However, death rate seems flat. Maybe covid mutated flu? used frequent supplement store worked at. Would buy tons expensive shit, brag money, “better drakes” house building. Hadn’t seen 3 4 years COVID obviously see douche shit place. I'm wearing mask right now.... look sexy! point dont care Fauci says coming within roughly ten feet anyone, need mask. are, respectful people either wear mask move keep distance. obviously think need wear mask running woods people around, think thread scenario! Might well take whole sub then, cause that's turned into. What's needed every country pandemic law whereby health officials supercede politicians matters. last time virus ravage world. may even last time century. I've hearing ""you can't live fear"".  buddy lab manager, know health care workers. None say that. lot people area decided want be. I'm locking on, needed. also, I'm shutting super-high-spreading things necessities (indoor concerts, bars). unless cases really low. think makes sense follow data what's happening overall. 

Anyway, ways determining IFR inherently flawed messy. generally rely trying figure much population infected, course. two problems this:

1) large-scale studies significant sampling bias issues. can't rely something people asked ""do want give blood see ever virus"" oversample people think virus want verify it. lot studies showing low IFR's big issue. 

2) situations EVERYBODY tested see virus (cruise ship, specific small town, etc), necessarily representative society whole. cannot necessarily extrapolate much, much larger sets people overall. 

Now, one thing sure shows absolute floor sample many millions people: .28% New York City died this. Therefore, large sample, know absolute sure can't lower that. got mad didn’t go restaurant hotspot dad’s birthday even though let stay house. It’s driving little bit nuts culture extremely family oriented think survive months without seeing other. tried guilt it, worked, I’m thinking back head I’ve seen parents twice since started. problem take cooking home I’ve person they’ve seen since started well... Like facts? average, number excess cases per 100,000 residents states reopening without masks ten times number states reopening masks 8 weeks (643.1 cases; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 406.9, 879.2 62.9 cases; CI = 12.6, 113.1, respectively). Excess cases 6 weeks could reduced 90% 576,371 63,062 excess deaths reduced 80% 22,851 4858 states implemented mask mandates prior reopening. 50,000 excess deaths prevented within 6 weeks 13 states implemented mask mandates prior reopening."" people gov freaked need justify themselves. Additionally, deaths lasting side effects COVID infection. It’s fault leaders, pure simple get you’re saying, testing becomes wide spread differences CFR IFR minimize. 

Also infection rate COVID (R-naught) twice high influenza means spreads significantly faster (exponentially faster). Higher infection rates mean higher fatality numbers.

But still don’t like numbers, back June COVID still estimated least 6.5 times deadlier flu. Fauci experts said this, Google it.

Which brings ask, what’s point? COVID much deadly flu anybody’s estimate creates lifelong health problems people survive. 

It’s flu. Americans test far EU, lie that? -Created Federal Reserve

-Created League Nations

-Supported Women's Suffrage


I understand southern strategy fact democratic party major conservative factions era. BUT, Wilson definitely conservative, looking presidency. bother.

I never made claim. said batshit crazy comment bullshit. burden proof friend. Sweden forbidden commit crimes *by law* Obviously IFR going vary dramatically based population demographics median age, obesity levels, health care system capacity. good thing poorer countries tend far younger populations. developed world, I'm guessing like 1% seemed NYC places Europe. course there's really great way even determine percent population become infected since antibody levels vary many would negative tests within several months. Personally believe presented range. see people stating flu 0.1%, that's CFR, 3/4 flu cases asymptomatic flu diagnostic tests much less accurate good COVID tests. Even 0.6% IFR COVID well 10X seasonal flu. Trump football trying kill many potential voters possible, final stretch election. arrested today Moncton causing disturbance flight. likely use say “they” afraid message must right! Ah ok, think get it. ""Everything changed"" must narrative media spoon-feeding you. I'm seeing ""changes"", couple silly fads. Jag vet. 

It still much socialist. Yup, I've noticing months now. Check threads ""developing"" countries (like Vietnam Thailand) handling pandemic well surely bunch comments insecure Westerners saying countries lying numbers. can't accept fact developing country actually beat something. What’s really funny someone brings “how governor let people die nursing homes (I’m Pennsylvania) always come back “I’m fine letting grandma die open economy” (which I’m not. putting there) reaction universally negative. tend shut remind that’s republican plan handling part wrong? didn’t involve Russian plot didn’t almost emails deleted couldn’t get caught? Either block facts bright. What? world different place WWI, Spanish flu not. words. article mentions anecdotical cases, [the study links finds 1 10 hospitalized patients report hearing issues tinnitus eight weeks discharge.

Now, sure: hospitalized patients subset patients; hearing issues tinnitus quite sudden complete hearing loss (although personally testify tinnitus quite unpleasant); might caused care received hospital rather COVID-19 (but likely make difference patients).

Even things said, think study alone enough warn brushing hearing issues ""a hundreds less cases"" still know little COVID, especially study patients currently waiting audiological assessment, delayed ongoing pandemic.

I really believe underestimate brush issues even *clinical capacity see there's prevalence* post-COVID people simply yet able let see doctors lingering issues! didn’t either. I’m wrong, I’m asking why? said “hahahahah ok” me. Yes. critical thinking skills either underdeveloped you’re bright. Yeah man you’re right I’m sorry! Wow, wow!

4 years. Small pox.
Just got flu shot last week. Yes.  2 years lockdown person? one - big deal lockdown 18-24 months person?

I'm saying big deal, lockdown also big deal, keep longer time way bigger deal virus itself. say necessary solution case situation spiraling control - like hospitals getting full.
There good solution situation, every choice cost different people, unfortunately try find optimal trade-off. try save many lives possible, need also think living.

And I'm pushing numbers, I'm explaining globally IFR 0.15% possible locally vary due many different factors. think anyone World currently knows exact number, estimations nature precise. know total infections number, probably even know real total deaths number. blind? hopefully!

I get y’all hate Trump want blame everything weird hero worship Faucci bizarre. cause entire mask debate held accountable. mean? commenting Covid subreddit. honestly expect catch 6 months happened since Covid hit US? Turn news man spoon feed history. Exactly! Even 95% people willing able, takes time make enough give vaccine everyone takes time distribute it. visited Idaho month ago went indoor restaurant first time six months. Beautiful! sad see politicised wearing mask became.

Yes, think 3 wealthy men best healthcare world admitted hospital day 1 illness reflect outcome average Americans, sent home told come back near death?

I thought Trump wealthy all, much debt according democratic sources. Regardless, since official treatment Covid-19, going hospital like Trump would worst thing could do, risk nosocomial infections, might pass along Covid-19 infection others there. magic treatment think Trump received made easy get over? Happy hypoxia. happened commonly early people wouldn’t slow recover. know disease people slow recover far fewer people fall sick. Even though Hillary uncovered numerous plots? doesn’t change it’s like flu. *yet another* third party lab data dump. keeps happening South.

We enough data show two reasonable options hope do! takes thin herd dumb protect around them, let's get done! Yeah whole thread trip. There's top comment like 1300 points, gilded, talking sub nothing covid deniers playing it, there's upvoted comment claiming 12% Covid cases require mechanical assistance, anywhere near truth. You’re right, wouldn’t. We’re cowering behind masks staying 6 feet apart whatever else virus greater 99% survival rate.

Imagine quickly we’d roll if/when real, actual threat emerges. like soap opera character gets amnesia, old plots repurposed. Could Florida undercounted 400,000 test results? trying blame lab?  15000 deaths taking safety measures... You’re stating CFR flu, comparing presumed IFR COVID-19.

Proof? ""Like this""? broke disagreements COVID precautions? That's fine, make sound like something happened long time ago ""she never changed,"" curious. sounds weird say someone visiting family, lol (if read outside COVID context). believe probable expect ""additional wave"" illness soon, people start getting infected again. viruses do. useless stem tide? initially cope overwhelmed hospital system. buy potentially months treatments, research, vaccine development. get better treating virus stalling lives saved.  **Oct. 11, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

I'll happy wrong, that's first study I've seen tried argue appreciable immune response much later. I'm busy right I'll read depth later, sure looks like study fauci waved starting ramping up. Last week math 250 dead hour. couple days ago, roughly 283 hour. done since but, yeah, taking off. Yeah, fuck this. full support (as fan school’s team) unacceptable Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* serious? OP told moment ago Why? perspective profound correct cockeyed views? 

(Hint: it’s not) coming post ""No shit Sherlock"". really people still know this? hurt? Well late millions upon millions people starve death due lockdowns.

But sure short sighted view people still think worth it, lives outside bubble matter slightest. dude, can’t dumb. It’s interpretation normal. hell that! bases medical opinion, part, trusted medical organizations sources. Early pandemic, CDC body supportive widespread mask use Fauci espoused ideas. personally think CDC said hoarders price gougers clear everything clinics would access. Now, that's opinion, there's proof there. But, Fauci changed tune CDC stated yes masks needed. Again, medical doctor use evidence based medicine follow health guidelines. health guidelines change, adapt change. use leeches treat fever anymore consider homosexuality mental disorder. problem comes change practices necessary--that's Trump comes in. Oh 100% Agree, question everything China say, example, government says exist... dare they!! never ""China"", therefore 100% certain place made lie, like lied 2nd largest economy world non existent 1.4 billion people!!! thanks think wrong.

I think math add up. 

To go 0 750 million cases 300 days means number infected doubled every 10 days since January. 

Or China hit herd immunity 715 million cases.

He say many active cases ten percent, maybe implying China went 0 700 million spread.

I know, see number possible. I'm hoping someone show data math. Where/when 700 million, non-symptomatic cases? 1% fatal, dead bodies? friend asian also family-oriented loves spending time family. However, majority contacts parents lives (he's college decided use dorms year, well online), seeing friends (who got tested recently getting together), seeing relatives consist 2-3 people. Meanwhile, girlfriend white extroverted. stopped visiting place realised often went out. Eventually lead breakup.

I think culture anything it. probably dealing different circumstances though, feel you, like friend. rough.

Edit: Also, NEVER let significant force anything makes uncomfortable. emotionally abusive manipulative, never put that. Human race. ethnicity nothing this. Species would also work. friends close 13 years refuse see indoors. “can’t live fear flu” mindset won’t it. Sorry, I’m going cautious. Harrell (the mom) symptoms tested positive exposed infected friend. Harrell’s husband mild symptoms. Another patient mentioned article mild symptoms: “Liam, 23-year-old student, lost 70-80 per cent hearing left ear COVID-19 infection.
Liam contracted COVID-19 June, fever.” Also, study covid victims found virus inner ear: Dr. Matthew Stewart, associate professor otolaryngology Johns Hopkins Medicine “and colleagues performed procedures bodies three people died COVID-19 infection see could find virus inner ears.
In two three cadavers, found novel coronavirus middle ear mastoid bone skull, located behind ear. study published JAMA Otolaryngology -- Head Neck Surgery.” Would said conservatives Dems Republicans absolutely do. hope we're wearing masks past spring though. wear public loathe it. Remember summer Europe blessed US dumb reasoned economy? important. Let hate caring safety. Never back down. true friends co-workers care people appreciate caring others well being. appreciate standing up. Stay safe. don’t know. I’m clearly doctor. Ashamed race mean ashamed species? agree measuring real IFR easy. also imagine IFR USA higher world average due factors discussed. estimations based Western countries place 0.3% 1%, believe time imagine globally much lower. probably means different countries use different approaches, based situation ,but unfortunately currently case - high risk countries neglecting low risk countries (due young population) rich enough taking drastic measures push significant part population poverty.
Not mention I'm 100% sure lockdowns best answer - countries like Sweden Japan lock currently situation control (yes know Sweden deaths Norway, contrary many predictions peaked around time European countries locked down) Perú strict lockdown since march highest death rate world regardless cannot control yet.

To clarify, I'm anti-lockdown per se, believe extreme measure used carefully (we marathon run early lockdowns Europe like running sprint, ran steam quickly situation getting worse spring lockdown longer realistically option) still need research really works not, balance saving lives collapsing counties pushing millions extreme poverty Humanity stupid, emotionally self-defeating, know got far. I’ve people say “we go back life going get eventually.” Well, wear damn mask year use caution? I’m demanding stay locked him, tentative. dislike lot, he's bully jerk. But, I'm glad he's hope recovers. Seven months passed still know anyone covid. looking explanation. similar deaths per million? one country fault one man, one unfortunate turn events. i'm curious difference two. Safety measures irrelevant determining fatality rate. got 96 son got agreed Corps fairly well balanced occasional oddball. suspect infantry regiments bit volatile prone overt opinions, depending CO maybe composition is.

Sad hear exists anywhere Corps. Everyone green nothing else, like we're taught boot camp. mean, let’s real, tend worse diseases covid here. Sorry, I’m going listen medical folks. 

“We want normalcy!” do, that’s what’s going happen right now. 

I wonder people like historical pandemic...?  Thanks showcasing you’re complete moron incapable processing data

You also avoided every question hardly progressive, southern style arguing you, pointing full legacy. official house/congress/senate. one cares do. sensitive confidential information “decided delete”. Yes... it’s illegal. Also different email government given one. sure. never happened. Keep rioting. Happy proven wrong see America start give shit fellow citizens, evidence yet. flu also bunch weird, uncommon symptoms. Nobody talks them, though, people generally know them. course confused. Dodge deflect. Lol appropriate username ever. 1918 Flu infection fatality rate high first, until..... Yeah right announced full person classes spring semester.

I doubt could fill stadium though. Okay live different worlds. got caught.... deleting emails. ok. happens schools get defunded much do. easiest way control masses, keep stupid. Firstly, according Republicans’ report Russia, Russia helping Trump, Hillary. Secondly, oh deleted emails, illegal!!?!?!! Really? way like flu? can't think similarities? shit I'm Brazil nonsense. president Bolsonaro member Trump fanclub, always sends wrong message population. Australia then? Epilepsy attack typing data computer? phrase ""wrong side history"" help. makes winners losers rather what's true. intrinsically adversarial. LOL. Phoenix February 6th came pretty sick mainly high fever (100-104). days quick ER visit x-ray showed mild pneumonia case. Tested negative flu 4 times (Urgent care visits ER) also negative Valley Fever. assumed bacterial pneumonia got medicine. Spent next 5 months returning exercise shape pneumonia hit harder later terms breathing. July get antibody test covid antibodies. either crazy bacterial pneumonia covid. Young 19 yr old athlete O2 never went 97% Jesus sucked Yeah. government can't trusted. stories can't trusted. let's anything good say one ever forget shady fucking sick are. 

When bots start saying China Gods work say something, sorry. hiding numbers, significant outbreak Panhandle, public schools... omg, saw LSU next; pics latest game looked like something last year read ticket takers stopped masks temp precautions lines backing shit sherlock ""mild"" like mostly innocent looking disease? Faucci started saying masks useless

You badmouthed MacGyver. one aspect often missing pro-Sweden take. often banging fist table US take approach like Sweden ones would call Sweden communist/socialist state ignore factors enable Swedens approarch. also ignore fact compliance public main driver approach. ""liberal"" bro people imbeciles. 

We need culling. Let virus thrive. intelligent, know do. One day's case like drop ocean. misinformation. 

The statement 10% world infected. based rough review seroprevalence studies. 

The commonly-cited 0.1% flu IFR IFR-S, IFR symptomatic individuals. True IFR lower, hard calculate people die influenza.

The put consensus IFR: Unlike Swine flu, overestimated early on: reported IFR China February 19th. scientific consensus upon policy based February March. got stuff wrong, IFR one things.

CAVEAT: applies first wave, perhaps May. nearly zero data fatality rates may changed. hopeful decreased, beware loud claims already happening.

CAVEAT 2: Risk **highly age dependent**. Success shielding at-risk hugely influence burden. people age 18, seems likely COVID risk indeed smaller flu risk, although pressure comparing two led scientists reexamine flu risk chatter vaccination pressure caused us overinclusive wrt flu deaths. Nevertheless, COVID mortality risk extraordinarily low among young - extraordinarily high among old. People making decisions based risk aware relative risk (compared one's yearly risk dying) essentially 40 up; like living another year two weeks. like way thinking things - neither exaggerates minimizes. Nobody think death sentence add extra year's death chance course weeks. chance really gets daunting get late middle age. Age-dependence also means younger developing countries spared lot burden older countries like Europe typically see ~~1% IFRs, England Spain. Bad news bad news good news is....also bad news. Got similar numbers?  news au basically owned Fox News. Im surprised trying spin misleading titles.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sounds supremely sucky Clutching straws there, bubba Got flu shot yesterday first time while. Dr. puts band-aid says I’m done. idea he’d already given shot...

Now soreness however, definitely feeling Pretty sure troll rilling people shits giggles. Get vote. Get ghouls responsible office. Donald getting desperate, even camp opposing him. Since HIV+ 31 years, I’ve gotten pretty accustomed needle poked arm. 

But vaccine needles tend lot less painful. Thing COVID necessarily going kill them. could spread virus family members, go spread seniors nursing homes want die COVID, immunocompromised friends, children spread families.

Nursing homes reopen, think lot resources keep everyone safe. Americans refuse said right things would absolutely bristle idea need non-American countries doing. That's whole point. get Anti-Masker wear mask. Look 14 day trend, rising sweden. Whatever help you! know exactly you’re talking about. day getting blood drawn, panic attacks. hate it. right wing still mess. done liberal leaning folks experts suggested could almost over. I'll never forgive conservatives blood hands. Yeah, live NC, like 10-11 million people 2000 like 5 days last week. one even blinked. 

They great, earlier, reduce numbers without complete lockdown. depends people part. Politically similar half equation, neither countries MUH FREEDOM culture America does. That's matter competent leadership is, believe current leader nowhere *near* competent, culture would still people refusing mitigate spread. Nancy Pelosi said “no” direct checks $1,200 Trump said would sign immediately. can't spell WHORE without W.H.O. lockdowns prolong inevitable, unless advocating literally locking rest time, people get infected. estimated could 10% world infected (700 million) even lockdowns place.

Nature run course, society move death rate less 1%. manually adjust numbers account things per capita basis still would align points. Who's one arguing bad faith then? trend established. Although Sweden underreports weekends become obvious another two weeks. Same. getting started though. don’t know empty chairs setup memorial didn’t get attention. ""At beginning pandemic, medical experts lacked good evidence SARS-CoV-2 spreads, didn’t know enough make strong public-health recommendations masks.""

At beginning, evidence *anything* related covid19. stop telling us wash hands stay 6 feet apart. could told us wear masks, medical community west long standing dogmatic opposition masks somehow requires greater evidence mitigation measures. Thank kind redditor. plan! 

Next time need get shot plan pumping beforehand walking eyes closed. Y’know like listening crazy music car. i’ll tell without saying anything. way don’t dread knowing coming. distract enough maybe i’ll get it! 

The worst part thinking freaking further. avoid good Military “flu mist” route went back shots effective. trump even good that? right, end metric, narrative lockdowns destroy economy supported surface level evidence. someone provides detailed analysis prove otherwise, I'm convinced facet anti-lockdown argument. Germany don’t harder measures better compliance rate. It’s others factors.

At moment compliance rate mask France good, far better end lockdown. must wear anyway otherwise get fine. could possibly mean, chance infection small unlikely non-zero.

For example, New Zealand Covid-free while, mysteriously reinfected. think came [frozen think surfaces really dangerous people. danger is, wipe virus area, way come back. takes one infection start pandemic. covid particles surfaces would disease's last-ditch effort rise again. not, nothing anything. America definitely flaws evils, maybe countries tally up. focused COVID though since r/coronavirus. feel like NJ often forgotten tragedy NY bad, guys got hit terribly. hope people remember stay safe. Hang there. Oct 11: first I’ve heard it. girlfriend get blood drawn little nurse collapsed vein arm. girlfriend little, almost died. severe fear needles this, she'd take opportunity deal them. It’s disingenuous use image head it’s statement. mind blood draws, get panic attacks brain imagines foreign body forced blood stream..

It may surprise learn, then, blood draws involve foreign body entering bloodstream vaccinations never do. Vaccinations given intramuscularly never blood vessel (in fact aspirate inject ensure blood vessel). Soooo scared opposite. Cheers. He's saying thing since April. shift official middle path needed…. many restrictions damage people’s livelihoods provoke resentment. ‘Virus run wild’ lead lots deaths well debilitating long-Covid among younger people. ninja-vaccinate anti-vax ppl.
Watch get quoted now. arguing USA good China bad. differences political systems cultures institutions deal threats like COVID. USA unquestionably bad actor many realms across globe. Agree much. virus robbed best years. sheer lies China told killed millions robbed generations youth. umm, doctors say? large numbers people even asymptomatic ones show permanent lung damage blood vessel famage, cardiac issues even neuronal ones. isnt damn flu , disease fucks ur cardiovascular system veins throughout body ,m happens lungs often take damage first symptoms similar flu.

&amp;#x200B;

We hardly understand disease. get notion everyone gets anything cataclysmic. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin White House Chief Staff Mark Meadows Sunday called Congress pass coronavirus relief bill using leftover funds paycheck protection program negotiations comprehensive package continue.

In letter House Senate members, Mnuchin Meadows said White House would continue talk Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Congress “immediately vote bill” would enable use unused Paycheck Protection Program funds working toward bigger package.

“The nothing approach unacceptable response American people,” wrote.

At least 20 Senate Republicans said opposed $1.8 trillion offer White House Pelosi compromise package. Spotted Civ player. least flu vaccines, used 50. city Germany around 300 cases 1 death tegnell stated strategy would avoid infection now, cases sweden rising again. think China would tolerate level dissent America endure regarding COVID mitigation? honest. He's wrong, point lockdown give time put measures place.. Hospital staff, ppe, testing/isolation protocol, contact tracing. know, stuff still actually insane reason. ICUs stop slow virus ? Wow nice Chinese science telling world human human transmission whole world infected. mean definition literally told us wear masks (the CDC), told wife listen... continued wear them.

They told us worry food clean shopping.... told wife listen either, continued clean groceries. 

I think they've wrong many things. best advice overly careful possible, that's default. become volunteer healtcare system digging grave services, problem solved would like object last sentence. 

I much feel flu shot year. man whole concept foreign course findings Chinese government. governments bought international corporations, protect fish industry. Chinese government give shit fish industry. Yup. dad’s pediatrician, gets flu every year. Sometimes multiple strains. vaccine keeps mild. actually 0.02% age group 200,000 becomes 20 000. anyone business them.

So trust government company, pretty much, least transitive property. Can't say disagree. Saturday/Sunday numbers tomorrow Sunday/Monday. We'll see trends tomorrow Tuesday. wait 15 min shot. every flu shot ive got ive wait afterword kile 15 min exactly reason mods gonna ban dude spam don’t look away injected? Jesus Christ can't even imagine inhaling microchip. I’m sorry hear :( hope gets better noted, plainly misinformation.

the doctor's name nabarro, navarro, although suspect even read article.

i'm frankly disgusted deliberate pushing misinformation subreddit and, unfortunately, internet. people like whoever wrote headline enemies truth, humanity itself. worst us.

the 'condemn' lockdowns. said lockdowns alone ineffective possibly deleterious follow measures. merely end yo-yo cycle.

nabarro speak entirety WHO. obvious position, special envoy WHO. also find made general proclamations line fact consistently said goal avoid lockdowns possible. implication may necessary get things control areas.

the supposedly great barrington declration says compassionate approach balances risks benefits reaching herd immunity, allow minimal risk death live lives normally build immunity virus natural infection, better protecting highest risk.

this assuredly position WHO. much obvious anyone read things puts out.

and vulnerable immediately allowed resume life normal. Simple hygiene measures, hand washing staying home sick practiced everyone reduce herd immunity threshold. Schools universities open in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, sports, resumed. Young low-risk adults work normally, rather home. Restaurants businesses open. Arts, music, sport cultural activities resume. People risk may participate wish, society whole enjoys protection conferred upon vulnerable built herd immunity.

you lying. plainly deceiving people hope mods ban ever posting again.

the great barrington declaration pushed climate science denialist organization funded charles koch: think climate science denialists too? problem enough screening reopen places rely tourism combined people reluctant travel anyway. necessary quarantines

Maybe don’t understand lockdown useful people fail use measures contain virus. I’m NYC certain areas wouldn’t locked simply used basic wellknown preventative measures popular? like they're vaccine kind available currently.

I'd take proven vaccine even meant 100 paper cuts Essential workers still spread 🤷‍♀️ silencing scientists, limiting testing, faking data according 

????? never said ?????? someone abhors needles, think fantastic! pass every time get blood drawn, get injection something, etc, I’m pumped roll way. Go help escape weekend. breakout let see family. never liked blood Hey could work

If America dystopia principles sociology weren’t real Stop confusing learned computer box thing. Yeah needles make feel exact way. 

As kid, terrible getting shots. hated them. didn’t bother much anymore. could get shots without issue. 

Then got blood taken one day.. Passed convulsions process. Ever since then, kind needle freaks makes throw up/pass out. Shots blood. bueno. Interesting. wonder cannabis would help.
[The interaction endocannabinoid system renin angiotensin system potential implication COVID-19 currently COVID started minor congestion lungs, sporadic cough largest symptom besides runny nose (usually night time) dizziness itchy feeling back, similar dry skin. It’s weird little virus. I’m day 7 since exposure. Time tell! They’ve outbreaks start meat- poultry-packing places. I’m sure everything gets shipped usual. ive hearing covid vaccine last long. probably boosters everyone till eradicated China literally sealed Hubei, something America could even debate let alone execute. think happened people tried break out? 

You're 100% right US vulnerable bio attack, much abundantly clear point; America, nature culture freedom liberty, figure ways counter countries like China don't. fear know convenient up-arrow Reddit express ""+1""-type feeling? Good article. think people become fatigued February things look different. People may start taking honest approach point (hopefully). expect herd immunity happen nobody lockdown virus mutates rapidly does? Antibodies last short amount time. ""Just look what's happened tourism industry Caribbean, example, Pacific people taking holidays,"" said.

So, WHO's official policy go vacation? Stay strong, think COVID19 going us least end next year. would LOVE run around spraying anti-maskers face something like could spray planes making trails something Don’t rinse produce? always have. SHUT FUCK downside see criticism FluMist completely ineffective administered properly. remember years back quit giving FluMist time high failure rate due improperly administered often.

I'm optimistic it. give needle. lot harder screw up. forgot couple zeros front three lol make good point, please break paragraphs. Fiance definitely fear needles like people thread saying administers Humira me. He'll certainly pass gets blood drawn sometimes pass gets vaccine. Gov Murphy LOVES long boring lockdowns. load defusers back commercial airplanes use Chem trails? /s Right needs acknowledgement opposition procedures coming one specific party. I'm sure how, logically, get around that. parties equally supporting science backing COVID prevention, absolutely would political issue. Unfortunately, made be. ""his"" strategy. one making decisions know. Anyway, models literally predicted this, know about. Also, Florida, summer winter hot outside. comfortable outdoors. yeah, opened everything people starting stop caring mask use well distancing. evidenced today maskless guy front Starbucks woman crowding behind mask mouth covering nose. highly recommend buying KF94 masks Korea. N95 masks, protect well people around you. No, Nancy Pelosi Chinatown. Ill put woth getting jabbed feeling like shit thats option offer nasal spray thats effective im taking that. lockdowns ever supposed primary control measure? thought reason US locked realized absolutely way combatting needed buy time Number keeps slowing down, great news! Depends phlebotomist. good phlebotomist worth weight gold. Gotta love armchair door Redditors seem know people making vaccine Savage lmao No, fine. Others definitely not. 

I appreciate suggestion! seems like problem along comment u/its_spelled_iain. curiosity, everyone got vaccine self-quarantine couple days, would solve it? wouldn’t around anyone potentially dangerous people situation similar ones would shielded virus fact people around longer risk infected. would work, sort makes wonder wouldn’t case vaccines could potentially put someone else risk. shame, would liked collect shells beach principle one could say...it's going spread anyway...survival fittest.

or...what already spread...and incubation time MUCH LONGER. Like year+.

And LATENT...it never goes away. Thus re-infections. Ms. Taylor, 31, contracted virus mid-June, thought she’d need brief break working lawyer Atlanta nonprofit helping low-income Taylor, lawyer, episodes brain feels like “white static.” couldn’t recognize car apartment complex’s parking lot take leave job.Credit go Lol actually idea, coming North America here! November Florida starts rise again, particularly seasonal migration Northerners. mind boggling U.S 210,000+ deaths. Yet, Iran issuing mask mandate 30,000 deaths. well? Commander Chief cares. people lost someone love. heartbreaking. I'm glad Iran taking seriously. Sweden one?

The Netherlands one Catholic Spain conquered south, strict protestants fled north border, there's belt right there, straight accross. Yep thing got tested antibodies July, negative. Sadly, numbers help them; ""Those fake numbers"", ""It's old people going die soon anyway"", ""The death rate going virus gotten weaker"", ""We're reaching herd immunity people protection earlier infections similar diseases"", etc etc expect official come with... suggest mass hugs love virus away. people get really sick end intensive care unit, number beds ICU extremely limited.

Once cap reached people die significantly faster can't get proper care.

The casualty rate directly affected kind care people get. Keep washing hands. Also, article states, ""The virus commonly transmitted people cough, sneeze talk."" Russia hugely flattered think capabilities USSR. going us raw resources large territory science/industry leftovers soviet era.  Bro come back earth, work full time job. find enjoyment chilling mean anything  Definitely board whichever approach works best. Given current state vaccine candidate trials, IM injections first available. nasal delivery trials probably part next generation vaccines wave.

No issues getting jabbed. flu vaccine, need vaccinator tell done (I look). vaccines like shingles injections noticeable, short term, slight discomfort much less unchecked disease. Yeah, state daily cases 90% countries world SUNDAY, nothing worry about, nothing... Good news, let's hope world leaders take note need nostalgic ‘let’s see numbers 2-3 weeks?’ really bring cheer? fainted making appointment... needle itself. even ""seeing needle"". 

As person lifted another person air trying hold body part mine giving needle. (I could see them, prick pain arm.) tell mine physical reaction small stimuls results lifting 150lb person. obviously 'overreact' small stimuls cannot stop myself. mental thought process stimulus. 

I wonder could treated like deal arachnophobia fear flying? Mine momentary tried investigate. warn nurses flinch given needle gotten better. Although one said ""That's flinch."" Afterward.

Since fainting could dangerous. could hit head. Perhaps might give ideas treating it? reminds show saw went area around chernobyl. take anti-radioactive liquid help protect radiation poisoning saw ""grape flavored"". general consensus give shit flavor going save life. I'm sorry getting process blood draws (had 4 past years) simply tell I'm going close eyes whatever tell tell I'm done. time move arm certain way, squeeze ball, etc. 

My last vaccination process chatting one medic gave jab. could definitely feel needle, particularly painful (unless badly. well, arm sore 2 days). thing really hate vaccines almost always develop headache mild fever approximately 2-3 hours after, usually feel fine sleeping off. Probably means it’s likely not. I’ll bite link sources please.

And that’s case entire population India Africa fucked No, can't trust ""science"" comes China. CCP policy place requires government review scientific manuscripts submission journal. [Link Bypass actually lot better numbing cream arm that's something really hospital fair tests done.

You ask! I'm peds actually standing order numbing cream pediatric patients, med-peds colleagues confused offer adults, order adult patients well. actually make difference tbh. pretty much yeah Dude...they 6 coworkers see every day anyways + 3 relatives. one's super spreading anything lmao.

I haven’t India west Africa think could
Do lockdown 2 months somewhere like Lagos privileged uneducated spoiled brat. 
Yes advocate lockdowns Australia Germany worlds poor day workers savings lockdown miles worse disease 0.6 IFR primarily effects old obese Long term health conditions. 

Read book people Nigeria doesn’t huge sick elderly population. What's worse that, apparently, Google showing GB Declaration website search results lot people showing 5th result page 1 several pages search, mainly people UK. I'm US, shows first result me.

But I'm hearing, lot British folks, Google shows articles criticizing GB Declaration first actual website. think agree perhaps first realized. American culture root problem here, right, Trump malignant symptom that. sarcasm? person sounds like they've living extremely cautiously put care get together organized. assuming crowded free without information. attack people living lives. ways groups people interact without ""super spreader event."" Australia. significant percentage population misinformed Newscorp well. surprising many running narratives. Except can't. Victoria, Australia, people restricted area within 5km home, police find outside 5km bubble slap hefty fine. going months, recommend anyone adovocates strict lockdown try themselves.

Spending 1 2 years studing online shitshow, online learning sucks can't cut it. also takes away valuable once-in-a-lifetime experience uni student . time meet new people, try new stuff enjoy uni life general, taken away end sight. what? logic ""if save lives"" then: stop driving save lives, stop drinking save lives, etc.

I also need remind vulnerble people protect themselves, own's reponsibility.

Long-COVID, much media (and sub general) makes somehow big deal, still rare. likely happend severe cases young people get it, laugh ill-effect. Next time see article, dig deep see whether particular patients gets ill get admitted hospital, mechanical ventilator. me, thankful even ""long-COVID"", ill would otherwise Schools good idea unless outside 

Pretty sure young people, COVID-19 deadly flu. UV therapy actually real thing that's used treat infections. didn’t say all. point nobody disagrees said it’s frankly different saying since day one. since lockdowns used last resort, seems like nothing this. Possible?! lockdown place now, look much UK spiked! waiting for? hospitals break down? point creating document allege wide ranging implications health human race, also put effort money making website solicit signatures, would seem (to me) make sense putting effort money audit list signatories.

Unless course pile hooey rushed publicity reasons... far know, (which little) military flu vaccines like joined 2013 around 2018. stopped effective vaccine delivered needle. cool worked tho Well, lets hope options snort gunk get quick stabbing sake humanity. chemtrails thing better put vaccine em physician handled testing told that, average, hospital still recorded one positive every forty thousand exams. positives repeat patients: infected initial run virus, recovered fully, reason, months later, showed evidence virus again. far, positives asymptomatic, physician saw indication virus spreading city. But, whenever hospital entered positive results government’s reporting system, somebody higher made decision publicize them. “I think they’re worried undermining confidence,” physician said. sure joke not, serious, Northern Ireland. vaccine

Obviously still much if, there’s good chance something available next summer. Wow awesome idea. didn’t anyone think it. Also, fart noise cuts meant skimpier caches protective equipment, Texas' chronic shortage public health workers made response difficult, experts said.  think enough Americans care ""how"" right now. absolutely see SEC football games packing crowds, possibly NFL ones too. Northern Ireland, I'd guess next lockdown? predict thread full calm, reasoned opinions need trust experts. Oh lord....a women posted xD Good job :) feral wallabies New Zealand dip though. misinformation. Measles example 90% attack rate. tegnells well publicized defense high death rate swedish strategy, deaths would occured following winter Sweden locked Norway Denmark. Thanks, British study interesting. Yeah, noticed thr CDC basically takes hospitalizations used project back symptomatic patients makes sense purposes number acute food insecure people at-risk countries could increase estimated 149 million pre-COVID-19 270 million end year life-saving assistance provided urgently.

So, no, happening currently. estimate presented fact BS website. 4u

SAS wasn’t suggesting American democracy messed solely Trump. symptom cause me. Honestly think would gotten really ugly Hillary office (let say don’t think half country would sloughing “just flu” could pin blame someone hated) possible COVID rebalance gender ratio killing men women? Particularly 20, 30, 40 age brackets make easier men dating market?? Serious question...
 
In Canada ages 20 - 29 4 female deaths 7 male deaths. would lead surplus 3 women.
 
Between ages 30 - 39 4 female deaths 11 male deaths, leaving surplus 7 women.
 
Between 40 - 49 16 female deaths 36 male deaths, leaving 20 women men. 
 
Out population 37 million nothing, Canada hit hard, I'm sure impact much bigger places like Spain Peru. thoughts? Zhang said experience working pandemic left calmer patient. drove carefully now; wasn’t rush. often asked Wuhan residents personally changed spring, standard response. expressed less trust government information; others said increased faith national leadership. nurse separated family admitted sometimes missed simple life crisis, lived hotel room thought nothing work. physician handled testing told since city’s seal lifted become fixated enough food pantry. Nowadays, always kept least sixty-five pounds rice, sixty-five pounds noodles pasta, thirty tins canned meat. “I five friends thing, store even do,” told me. mean anti-lockdown people disliked sudden believe reliable source? chance odds average, useless try pinpoint exact reasons individual cases. I'd say unless stress worrying really impacts you. want minimize stress living COVID puts us all. certainly seem, accounts, cleaning every grocery item bring home necessary. feel agitated upset unless so, however, say go safe clean use clean. want harm using bad chemicals. Meth. They’re I'm going Gym, wear mask, stay away people, wipe equipment use it. Thank this! makes perfect sense, boyfriend works fish processing plant, one coworkers tested positive getting wife (he never got symptoms tho), close contact employees infect single person. 

It’s crazy virus works. Try eating berries someone touched wiping nose. saw commercial ZShield face visor.

It seems like terrible product, since protect particles coming above, protect aerosols.

My understanding medical professionals use visors PPE, protect mask direct contact patients' fluids. right that? Almost like nonsense states achieving little... 🤔 old people lagging bit behind still increasing soon start passing away bigger numbers, basically? another outbreak recently locked city occured level three restrictions, harsh level four restrictions initial lockdown. put rest country alert level two harsh level three. 

The government putting huge emphasis contact tracing asking citizens record go using contact tracer app. contact tracing able find isolate people contact anyone linked latest outbreak thanks we've zero community cases now.

They putting lot focus contact tracing asking people get tested unwell avoid another level four lockdown - yeah hurt economy lot. Minus people, daily discussion post semblance reason left sub. Venturing posts, sub full people gloating death cheering things getting worse makes right. Every bleak outlook accepted holy grail every piece good news greeted strict skepticism. Every time vaccine even mentioned science abandoned favor talking zombie movies politics. WITNESS LEFT PART LOCKDOWNS WORKING UTTER SHIT STAIN! sure information like correct opposite opinion lies stupidity? absolutely succeeded geography. isolated island low population, course, easier get control. landlocked countries hundreds thousands people entering day, New Zealand much. Wow, Forcing kids social interaction months negative social impact group NEEDS social interaction. Yes, rules rules. like them? enter sandbox. Seems simple, yeah?  fair, yall test hell lot do, iirc. course social distancing ideal pick one other, simply possible 24/7, let alone take people consideration simply refuse bother. one other, supplement one another. current situation terms infections deaths.

In context locking long term solution shows really isn't. Nope. Definitely creating science loving children left right community. Normos living paycheck paycheck plan B will.

The best brightest go back work physically feel personally safe. cops add tear gas pepper spray wonder folks would take seriously experienced asthma pneumonia knew feels like able breath.

Best luck friends family! Stay safe healthy! surprise orgies strangers. adopted adored. 😍 time hospitals overflowing. Lockdown broke uncontrolled spread. Problem like US - virus still here. people act like it’s gone, masks / hand washing / social distancing / avoid crowds isn’t maintained, cases spiral back control again. rules whatever hurt feelings

But maybe think reasonable ivanka trump part administration. I’m from, they’d thrown head first. pretty much covid. US one main drivers infection months. You’re fine :-) near 0 infections traced restaurants here. Case numbers useless compared March/April. say open everything up? Please quote reply. stored something closer regular temperatures pursue route immediate. Pfizer vaccine stored -94 F, can’t held higher temperatures 21 days needed shots. Moderna vaccine little better -4 F can’t stored 28 days second shot.

These vaccines something you’re going rollover CVS get. storage requirements significantly increase logistical challenges vaccine deployment. 

Hopefully nasal vaccine could solve that. Right? Plus gonna get microchips nose spray? Can't wait microchip. right. herd immunity. Masks forever! plenty masks, adherence hygiene, public socially distance. honestly don’t know you’re 12 years old adult methamphetamine problem...so I’ll assume literally do. places essentially locked Spring extensive community transmission. we’re seeing across Midwest, delays inevitable. Unless you’re willing lock forever, virus coming eventually. here. think told us needed sanitize things bring home, would pure chaos. supply chain still caught kinds products (like Lysol spray wipes). Even I’m wasting time it, I’d rather safe sorry. governmental (police/national guard) enforcement - nothing. Someone would essentially sneeze eyeball directly mouth get it.

Updated Sept. 24 Reminds lot ""We may never vaccine"" stories pretty commonplace months ago mysteriously stopped talking herd immunity letting virus spread... would lot deaths.

If talking herd immunity vaccine, that's goal. end pandemic faster anything else will. I’d like stem cell cocktail like president please didnt work nasal flu vaccine. FDA pulled ineffective. Awesome! hate needles! Lock doors keep 14 days, test them. Hahahaha, real. already going downhill Germany, too. definitely paywalled. covid stuff free Distance part it, much random chance. Look case study 2 3, cases infect person sitting right next infected people sitting 20 feet away. Everyone inhaled infectious droplets matter luck whether virus found ACE2 receptor bind to. cannot enter cells replicate inside body way. making bold assertions without evidence. long think they'd stay locked eliminate virus completely? What's timeline? need specific numbers evidence. wish people would listen. Intention change gathering numbers. downplay one's cause,but fact. True, like think civilization result individual human beings realizing way use individual strengths together achieve mutual goals overcome deficits particular individual may have.

A society care weak vulnerable serves strong powerful like marriage lasts good times splits soon encounters difficulty.

With COVID-19, truly ""all together"", strong would willing take preventative action meant weak would spared.

Hail hydra comfortable government kind control life beginning thing. always washing veggies, backroom grocery store really dirty place part healthcare america death sentence? seems reasonable?

i got 800 dollar bill finger wrap nieces finger cut cant imagine cost covid dont want 


i get money back tho someone else might screwed Community masks worse surgical masks, unless really good fabrics. Silk example good 99% community masks inferior surgical masks. chances getting infected store gas station small even smaller wear mask practice good hygiene.

The majority infections sustained contact majority poorly ventilated areas indoors. Username checks need degree tyrant I've dealt stuff chronically ill. honor student well. hanging best. stuff like brain training I'm going try salvage can.

I wish best. It’s apparently killing lot Facebook mommies today misinterpreted WHO’s comments. amount scoring week going even higher last week. Yes would. gonna get anxiety everytime eat something wash. Covid could anything two? One could rejected null hypothesis sample size tiny, one found N95s good non-N95s, without control.

RCTs gold standard. proves something works real world not. Many inventions great lab fail put context actually used in. wipe flu would double plus good! pandemic taught many people professions thought 'smart' fact NOT. spent much time energy back Feb March trying inform educate people SARS-CoV-2 [based information coming China Italy time] even doctors (esp nurses...) pretty nonchalant it. we're gonna get worse. implore everyone everything avoid virus.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people *want* believe misinformation.  That's particularly true disinformation politically motivated.

Providing better information fix it, want believe ignore resist it.  

If believe me, look comments posts subreddit.

You lead horse water, horse may decide kick spit you.  I'll believe see it, ngl Nah think China reporting 2 weeks earlier would change anything west. people got serious hit Italy, that's Feb. already. mention trace virus found sewage samples Nov Brazil. I'm jokes seriously, one issue forced medication? Consent irrelevant now? way cases per day March, weren’t testing much point. flavour would Englishman? Absolutely. Poverty disability entire community. It’s really wrecks communities countries. I’m sure you’ve never seen first hand, it’s pretty tragic. Watching little kids shit hole heart breaking. 

Poverty effects entire community much worse few, rare potentially unproven, isolated cases another type disability. combo 8 233 cases even hospitalized, people take evidence virus worth shutting world over?! is. Knowing biases media outlets step 1 actual informed citizen. swill information without critically examining gets you, going awful time. Wtf everything I've told lie people won’t comply masks, makes think they’ll comply Wuhan-style lockdowns? Trust me, best life. know want it.  hear whining localized rules Germany localized containment: ""It's sooo hard know local rules!!!!! want global rule!!!!!"" 2 RCTs paper come favor masks, RCTs, difficult conduct masks, necessary assess efficacy masks. paper also acknowledges recommends conclusion.

How providing ""evidence"" explicitly contradicts conclusion baffling. never gotten asthma. used nasal sprays allergies though; gross, wet &amp; go back throat tasting awful. countries lockdown deaths per capita countries lockdowns, exceptions.

Pretty easy interpret means even lieu research article.

""Are people come contact disease likely contract it? Could go either way. think I'll wait information decide..."" almost exactly that. Fruits veggies get washed dish soap. Anything plastic clean bleach solution, unless needs go fridge, keep table couple days. DeVos = de Vos 🤯  I’d report comment there’s option “batshit insanity”  Actually precisely kind situation individual countries Shengen legally close borders stop freedom movement. They've got complex situation Republic Northern Ireland. land borders go also cause huge amount absurdity Brexit. study published National Bureau Economic Research, areas country exposed television programming downplayed severity pandemic saw greater numbers cases deaths—because people didn’t follow public health precautions. Tens thousands people daily, impressive, barely make dent general population. Lets say interpret generously mean 99 999 innoculations per day. take 678 days get every inhabitant. Well tell leader mask mandate then. Everyone area wearing mask think area lift lockdowns. Simple that. Knowing Boris he'll fuck somehow. good article mentioned brain fog made worse physical mental exertion hallmark post-viral myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. lost career science writer due ME/CFS brain fog. worst remember 4-digit number long enough type phone. 

NIH neurovirologist Avi Bath, quoted article, leading deep biological study ME/CFS. studying long covid patients.  Dangerous probably right word, *are* contraindicated immunosuppressed people: *is* stupid expect level empathy necessary 7+ months lockdown... one know someone washed hands see mask. Also, even loose fitting mask better mask. Additionally, airborne illness sanitation surfaces way resource intensive simply wearing face covering. Time snorting practice Lol queue chem-trail crowd 3...2...1... That's weird stance church goer. Probably cricket game. Thanks whataboutism.  tested negative there's going 2M deaths economic damage shutting everything down. Probably 2M people lost health insurance losing job. someone never done it, im also board got physically attacked Wallonia worried cheese industry threatened Canadian cheese due new trade agreement coming effect. even work government Canada, saw flag backpack.

It probably one advanced cases hickery I've ever witnessed. “America broken, like heart”

😂 😆 😂 😆 😂...I’m sorry, I’m sorry... 😂 😂 😂 Unless want visit China. elderly care done France, grandparents live alone/with family/in homes traditionally? elderly risk 20-29 year olds bringing grandkids grandparents close? right. quarantine exactly kids need. stricter too. costs lockdown much justify, opinion. early stages, six week lockdown would helped, due sheer prevalence virus now, skeptical it. way would willing support six-week lockdown point promise everything fully open afterwards never go lockdown again, regardless many covid cases are. That's already happened places. two days testing, divide 2 compare typical daily report. seems contradict this: [Absence Apparent Transmission SARS-CoV-2 Two Stylists Exposure Hair Salon Universal Face Covering Although can't certain, hard believe every customer stylist washed masks every day, much less 60C.

According study, Stylist wore double-layered cotton face covering, stylist B wore double-layered cotton face covering surgical mask. also says stylists interacted without masks also infected several contacts outside salon also continued working symptomatic, hard believe diligent washing them.

Also study: says ""although masks vary greatly ability protect, using type face mask (without exploratory valve) help decrease viral transmission"" (page 7). aren’t sides. basic science known forever along science done past 10 months virus.

The virus doesn’t take side. it’s possible contain basic measures. prefer force-fed ""the correct opinion"" possible sides. Yikes. America selectively. could’ve done everyone. suffering we’re seeing political choice. Finish headline: ""... Missing Day ..."". two days' worth. Hi type 1 diabetic exact news cycle before. Aerosol vaccines 1) rarely effective injected vaccines 2) often risky since use weakened 'live' virus 3) almost always contraindicated groups need vaccines like elderly chronically ill.

I hope I'm wrong, seems like pharma marketing hype. Airborne vaccines? Anti-vaxxers gonna lose shit  possibly could caused spike mortality? Could global pandemic? think it’s sharknados. explanation makes sense. Nobody stopping wiping groceries. rest Western wastelands

makes sound cooler is. instead, got #boringdystopia prefer medical research ranting Republican politicians.  

How you? PPE production vaccine research production two totally different things. Three things, technically. Different supply chains, different people, different logistics.

Hopefully screw bad PPE. Europe too? thought well. also, one greatest philosophers religion 21st century, Alvin Plantinga. Heparin don’t get flu shot, tendency make little sick, literally don’t remember last time flu. But, I’m gonna right behind COVID shot, might actually get flu shot year, since COVID + flu simultaneously sounds like bad time, considering also asthma. Same. Science technology advances literally things bringing hope happiness days.  don't. US isn't. ...yeah point stands, get America far coronavirus problem nations, time I’m glad resistant relying government enforcing complete control lives moments whim. It’s trade sure, trade I’ll accept. putting face right box Froot Loops huffing in

wait, that? Hell yeah. Science technology win! current situation terms infections deaths.

Are even able click link??? number deaths Sweden 21 times high one Norway. less twice population. plan? Boris encouraging people return office save coffee shops causing this. People still mainly working office. 

If go work 5 days week 7-8 hours day, you’re likely catch Covid need factor commuting public transport. 

Going bar restaurant 1-4 hours week way less likely cause spike seen. 

Boris needs force wfh possible again. serious concern restricted gatherings effect people’s mental health. 

How? mental effects caused gathering 10 people instead 50? remind people temporary dangerous mental effects come isolation, decreased socialization. course, idea decreasing socialization means isolated, that's problem. Chances are, know vaccine candidates work fall winter. effective vaccine, commence mass production distribution. Essential workers at-risk groups going priority, available general public while, possibly 2022.

That said, expect continued disruption average person's daily life then.  Same. I’m super calm, chatty watch phlebotomist doing, next time send new person know don’t freak out. lately i've seeing blood donation drives offer free antibody testing. anyone know red cross sending data view % US antibodies? using data hospitalisations? hasn’t peer reviewed? 
And using CFR IFR work death tolls? 
You bed wetters really don’t understand science you... articles need stop using total numbers.

By end week Mexico likely higher death per capita US, they'll less 100,000 deaths. Spain nearly 33,000 deaths higher death per capita compared US. pockets stupidity bigotry everywhere. America let access global media empire bit obvious. preemptively answered question, nasal spray vaccine effective injected vaccine virus spread droplets, aren’t flu vaccines typically delivered way? Thanks!  Thanks information, clearly uninformed. guess spread virus left employers. know? I'm pissed N95 masks arent readily available. happened months ago. Stores them...even they're double normal price.

This complete failure part mobilize industrial might. Yes actually. That's what's scary beyond fact directly responsible somebody somewhere dying part chain spread. could feel perfectly fine collapse dead morning jog.

There's also heart, lung brain issues persist long infection. effects covid take anything trumps health grain salt. Wear blindfold close eyes ask nurse give verbal cues it’s coming. reaction know it’s happen. It’ll know it. Literally. believe so, care homes really tradition leading lot multi-generational homes

Needless say, love elders Even Sweden restrictions gatherings, non-lockdown countries. Coffee? would guess immediately happiness versus chance promise vaccine pan ready idk though Share reliable source support claim live attenuated vaccines dangerous get fucked. 


If you’re healthy adult without medical history nasal admin flu vaccine increased risk compared typical intramuscular injection. 

If currently treated something causes be/and/or diagnosed immunosuppressed get IM injection. 

Flu stuff:

If allergy eggs, get flu shot. 

If allergies mercury, stop eating mercury haven’t already go get flu shot. (Or get flu shot quit mercury eating). 

Immunosuppressed? Talk specialist phone quick go get flu shot. 

Are aged 6? Get flu shot. older 6 year old? Get flu shot? ages 1-6? Talk pediatrician phone quick go get flu shot.

You may noticed trend here. you’re age 6 pass go, proceed nearest flu clinic! 

If you’re concerned all, call local health advise line take advise (spoiler: it’s go get flu shot). 

If child 6 child likely still get flu shot ask sure. 

Source: think mean late avoid lockdowns. I'm opinion 6 week lockdown everything hospitals grocery stores, pay every citizen 2k 2 months compensate freeze properties businesses worry making rent. Essentially freeze everything 6 weeks.

Then go back life usual masks reduced capacity indoor spaces. first lockdown real lockdown. Everyone grandmother claimed essential pocketing ppp loans never made way veteran workers pockets. people can’t follow simple non-lockdowns mitigation’s like hand washing, wearing masks, gathering.

Are sure certain governments fix PPE pipelines, set contact tracing, boost healthcare infrastructure? non-lockdowns countries allow people small gatherings asked people cut social contacts large amount. South Korea, particular, ask people cut socialization ""80%"", far better asking people forego seeing family loved ones knows long. Ok, next question... determine correct? Pretty much j alluding GFA haha. Schengen adds problem GFA problem closing Darwin call natural selection? Well, don’t even know start this. 

First, I’m trying see empathy statement. Basic human needs food shelter different “affording mansion”. think really meant talked terrible effects lockdowns increasing poverty? people want live mansions job prevents that? Come on, man. 

I also say historically rich “doctors engineers” move poor neighborhoods drive housing prices up, pushing poor people out. like described. 

I suppose WHO’s statement meant people can’t possibly understand people life situation do. 
You sound woefully touch, honest. Please research. NL significant conservative Christian community Ok. move Singapore. globally 101/100 census 140/100 covid deaths i'd say throw things balance even really, risk going grocery store people far higher. Washing hands reduces chance fomite transmission low.

This relevant countries eradicated virus. need careful imported items could reintroduce it, may happened New Zealand.

However, definitely wash produce anything else directly put mouth. least water. contact harmful chemicals, dirty floors, dirty hands maybe rats too. Keep mind people Going Disney fly plane, visit parks, fly out. stats won’t counted Florida, home state. Disney likely either exporting virus, least encouraging risky behavior (travel, eating restaurants). Almost like religious people concentrated away staying, maybe belt perhaps? add that, also mandated use faceshields top masks, people 18 70 (iirc) allowed outside, essentially eternal limbo community quarantine, numbers seem agree correctness totally right, new thing, COVID almost certainly causing unprecedented rates. another note- maybe me- get flu vaccine via shooting nose, I'm much likely sneeze back out. feel drip wipe/blow nose. *feels* like less effective. 

Obviously, there's science anything comment, real: feel like nose within like two minutes. least shot, know fucking ***IN*** there. Dude got stem cell treatment Republicans right wing Christian fanatics fought hard ban, y’all get see benefits stem cell research/abortion must feel stupid put hate something beneficial huh? math BRO.

37,694,823 Cases 

1,080,241 Deaths

That's 2.7% said 2% decrease even though depending country see 1.8-2.4% vaccine definitely going ready roll November? think ""it going happen inevitably"" healthcare workers working 24x7 corona patients since start pandemic irrespective ppe? Yes.Let explain: like correct information correct, thus information like correct.

The opposite would lies stupidity. people example like information uttered favourite politician, per definition like correct information. means people purposefully wear mask believe virus hoax... wear mask avoid getting droplets vaccine... Got get facebook mommies, stat! love educate them. like Sweden.
edit: guess initial numbers target get everyone* vaccinated within 6 months, least plan West Midlands Warwickshire.

**less 50% population likely ever get vaccinated everyone ≠ everyone country rather target population.* virus harms people ones die. Many people talk ""brain fog"" ongoing recovering worst symptoms, symptoms nothing scoff at. read post someone talking suffered multiple ways.

My point is, want talk ""more harm good,"" honestly, deaths facet pro-lockdown argument.

Edit: found post: ‘What afraid get it. 0.2% mortality rate feels easy dismiss. feels small. 2 people thousand die.

And realize means 2000 people dead every million infected. means entire population world (7,8 billion people) gets infected (this realistic, something consider) would 15,6 million people dead.

And long term effects people survived. living world? response concerning. don’t need every inhabitant 20% major risk nobody's going wear mask forever, anyways? I'm done crap get shot spray whatever. know, religious area. Free churches relatively popular comparison Church Sweden. northern såland around city Jönköping Hopefully necessary again, trajectory states infections plus start flu season... see. unfortunately, state preferred method covid mitigation was. glaring problem limited options given contagious virus is. Mask mandates ignored huge swath citizenry, good luck trying enforce limitations small group gatherings personal residences. ideal world able provide enough N95's everyone needs protection, real world resources severely constrained. 'condemn' lockdowns. said lockdowns alone ineffective possibly deleterious follow measures. merely end yo-yo cycle.

nabarro speak entirety WHO. obvious position, special envoy WHO. also find made general proclamations line fact consistently said goal avoid lockdowns possible. implication may necessary get things control areas.

the supposedly great barrington declration says compassionate approach balances risks benefits reaching herd immunity, allow minimal risk death live lives normally build immunity virus natural infection, better protecting highest risk.

this assuredly position WHO. much obvious anyone read things puts out.

and vulnerable immediately allowed resume life normal. Simple hygiene measures, hand washing staying home sick practiced everyone reduce herd immunity threshold. Schools universities open in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, sports, resumed. Young low-risk adults work normally, rather home. Restaurants businesses open. Arts, music, sport cultural activities resume. People risk may participate wish, society whole enjoys protection conferred upon vulnerable built herd immunity.

the great barrington declaration pushed climate science denialist organization funded charles koch: great barrington declaration restrictions qualifications sign it. even need exist! seems be, least evidence China, inevitable however probable may seem. much ""opportunity"" ""guarantee"". I’ve leaving non-perishables car couple days shopping. common practice anyway. People gross. germy kids touch nose mouth touch EVERYTHING grocery store. one keeps people starving becoming homeless. ""The experiments were, however, carried virus friendly conditions - dark room stable temperatures humidity - virus may well well real world.""

I would say considering survives significantly less amount time daylight hotter dryer temperatures. Stories like wife limit exposure friends family. want anyone's death shoulders. wear masks around time. living fear like say. living smart. wearing mask chances spread virus anyone else. Even cloth face coverings 70%+ effective. Nope. Even hospital rooms, hard time trying culture virus surfaces. Media wants keep pushing though. government reacting virus ways can. can't fault trying protect freedoms much possible (they foundations built society all, can't throw whenever convenient) 

For government institute really strict mandatory countermeasures, get horribly bad first. they'll definitely comes that, worry.  can’t donate blood I’m gay Thailand made many cases better. sisters masks much better store bought ones. thinking along, people would think I'm coronavirus non-believer anti-masker something ever said loud. world vacuum coronavirus. many, many terrible things hurt us. Especially 90% world people rich first world countries. Huh. Strange. Sounds like youd used prick ;) routes concern. They're mutually exclusive. CCP bots trolling me, lol Yes... North Dakota, biggie high death toll 100% happen. probably watch it. Nothing said controversial even change position. Lockdowns continue last resort. we’ve seen every country besides China, case. Yeah, shit. Everyone knows lockdown long time solution, economical psychological reasons. Unless vaccine comes soon, we'll strike balance acceptable death toll covid losses lockdowns. reason care. Masks usually useless people wear oroper masks. surgeon's mask help much.

The best control social distancing. Stay indoors. Minimize unnecessary visits visitors. need nice little outdoor hangouts masks sad lonely old people maybe routinely sterilized hazmat suits rented sent cleaned uses need tactile contact. 

If sterilized properly given days uses, unlikely viruses remain inside hazmat suits even different people use them.  Bruh straight Contagion love Could explain certain someones recent behavior, could explain behavior since 2016

Person woman man camera Sounds pretty good. I’ve always crippling phobia needles fine me. see karens using info horrible things... someone enjoys getting flu shots blood tests, still acceptable. Actually, wild vaccine could inhaled all. neat. doubt help, get regular blood draws (monthly), try donate 1-2 times year, administer medication via injection, help one kids same, get annual flu shot. Lots needles I'm getting at. order distract slight pain (flu shot) sometimes intense pain (tire pump-sized donation needle), focus good doing. Whether routine blood work I'll learn results, ""common good"" element donation, fixate elements seem help diminish real perceived pain. Hah! come White House press department? LOL Tennessee.. gtfo. Wash hands.  I’m still waiting find long lives human skin. virus around almost year now. well there's video interview. CONTAGION RIGHT Yes, 8 50% 16. No, 22 cases 16 8 50% 22.

If know case outcome 6 them, excluded. could well severe symptoms could well lesser symptoms. Read wrote originally. ""50% secondary exposure cases **with known outcomes**"". know outcomes include unknown outcomes completely totally cases didn’t change, number commenting on. According don’t count why’d say 22 cases?

There indication one way whether changed INFORMATION GIVEN. Again, completely totally dishonest here. said 22 known cases reinfection. true. gauge severity reinfection, information go cases known outcomes. try make completely dishonest argument like trying removed term protective immunity uselessly debating semantics it. seems deterred that.

Because thing terms immune system responds challenge. actually. argument there’s reason think reinfection present dire problem.

So, reinfection known coronaviruses possibility due short term protective immune responses demonstrated Nature Medicine article, one somehow special? Additionally, homologous coronavirus reinfection also shown. But, somehow, one special? Come on. arguing gut rather arguing science. Czech Republic back June/July covid still problem US. Czech word ""schadenfreude""? anti-church stuff kills me. 

It’s perfectly acceptable, nay, encouraged go protest US. Sometimes tens thousands one place, heaven forbid people allowed congregate prayer. mean, let’s use common sense here. 

One okay other? Clearly attack religion. Yet another double standard. mean, guess.

I don’t agree overreaction people something maybe associated Covid. Throwing arms saying “great another symptom.”

People need understand exceptional experience. norm. 

But unless caught virus action, don’t think definitively say caused Covid. tested positive week later. every country pretty much taking chin - ""cases"" standpoint...regardless measures. escaped... demoted, apparently raising concerns Trump administration’s promotion hydroxychloroquine treat COVID-19, Rick Bright resigned federal government Tuesday, alleging effectively unable resignation underscores badly continue fail whistleblowers bravely come forward disclose waste, fraud, abuse power, wrongdoing within federal government. Lol. Yet it’s rate transmission higher flu people hospitals. must magic. anything like ever happened? provide source case ""ENTIRE world"" this? long list offenses US caused countries; so, would without reason. Simply put, really need get head ass occasionally let oxygen reach deprived brain. take dog vet blood drawn little devil stay quiet hold her. Something happened procedure started bleeding.. end me. totally fainted took ground me. vet sure help first. hospitals fucking prepared they? Let's ban food imports unless want see grandmas killed Sweden’s cases going up. Looks like herd immunity. come on. None going place years like article says. straight dystopian.

It's dystopian think way. much better frame differently yourself. adaption process much psychologically easier dont fight it.

There real option. prepared things like OPs article, stuff like significant psychological, societal cultural question people profoundly affected major events occur lifetime. People lived Great Depression different tendencies not; grew Vietnam War different outlook born postwar. *It expected modern-day society shaped COVID-19 pandemic.*

We straight told this. people think ""New Normal"" actually meant? google broken? [Fauci says additional lockdowns longer 

Granted guy flip flops every day I’m sure find something else says must lockdown harder again. last time checked UK going vaccine itself, kudos change mind though [here's source worry inhaled flu vaccine ineffective. backing ludicrous claim. Got it. long covid -- many young folks. perspective vulnerable groups.

The amount deaths older folks likely stabilize. older folk fine.

There evidence latency... There’s difference “beating” discipline children. Another point people faith want go church, cant deny blame church wanting money. hard times people depressed, losing jobs, lonely church community get away troubles place worship hope might thing gives hope, remember everyone condition you, able stay house day without going crazy.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  wrong. intermittent brain fog aphasia, they're describing article, skull-based tumor. understand they're talking completely. constantly re-read often re-write. sometimes become stuck trying say mean symptoms really bad. terrifying heartbreaking suddenly say tip (edit: type) completely wrong word phrase (edit: saw re-read wrote saving comment). 

Now imagine healthcare provider rely upon say write things accurately making serious mistakes accidentally said wrote word kind sounded similar.

Yet, still people refuse wear masks, wipe groceries products buy in-person receive via mail, wash hands. still people go meet friends without wearing mask think like flu hoax. SMH. notice, suggesting trust headline common sense assumptions. data argumentation inside article engage ignore. far dismissals latter. reason young account.  Exactly. Ive blood drawn ton lately shoulder/arm flu shots pin prick comparison. big brain move, anti-science crowd go dont want us lockdown, hate WHO, want lockdown spite them, lol Source? Sure, kind guerilla mosquito attack might way get anti-vaxxers get vaccine. already spread...and incubation time MUCH LONGER. Like year+.

Yeah, could also say viruses real earth flat, we'd making things evidence Yes. worse. Except people dont leave city, problem rest Holland!!! Idiots Staphorst. ReliMaffies cal people.. idiots.. One could say things; but, they'd illiterate morons. Yes, yes, remembered afterwards.

It's extended family idiot conspiracy theorists thought military exercise thing made people claim hoax run NATO dunno else..

And head connected trucks taking away bodies coffins trucks... America great yet? Half country doesn’t, fuck you. Exactly. China hugely dense already opened domestically. Ah ok ... statistics valid countries. ;) Probably one fans acting like wannabe. I’ll check posted.  Supposedly 400k previously reported knows. think that's took extra day, sift all. ""The sites capacity inoculate “tens thousands people daily” festive season supported “mobile vaccination units” across UK, paper adds."" single person world proven highly likely infected handling cash change name Carlotta.

One thing ""surviving"" another thing able spread. Perhaps grind cash powder snort fast enough? That’s load BS. college town (Tuscaloosa, Alabama) literally walk student health center Coleman Colosseum get tested you’re student. There’s also least 10 different testing sites general public, many require appointment one don’t require referral. town 100,000. Umm. doubt it. remember reading guy take colonoscopy without anaesthetic. written screaming pain photo taken march. Military trucks taking away coffins city Fair enough. happen know alternatives offer? Wearing masks good start. 2 weeks estimate knew disease never realistically feasible due incubation period. currently using lockdowns? Nowhere US. Mask mandates crowd control lockdowns. UK going reimpose tiered “lockdowns” keep healthcare getting overwhelmed. 



Lockdowns supposed mposed trajectory slowed certain ATTAINABLE goals met: adequate testing, contact tracing, treatment. Nowhere US reached goals yet even though attainable within weeks. problem one really tried. failure government set goals. countries similar situations. 




This people can’t follow simple non-lockdowns mitigation’s like hand washing, wearing masks, gathering.  corrupted politicians take care families relatives hired government. fuck everyone course. Gee, vaccine that’s taken way getting infected. evidence support statements survival fittest way civilized society operate. COULD protect vulnerable, many choose inconvenience them. justification sacrificing lives. That’s me. Good point, infected person elevator would breathing virus particles could hands too. realistic half-life virus counts, end isolation &amp; protection ideas.  real mission bring people together one place investors could get rich labor.

Now think understand saying.

Is purpose corporations bring people together investors get rich of?

I would argue that's mostly right, achieves returns investors ruthless amoral. fact, I'd argue entire trans-atlantic slave trade, unfathomable think unplanned, incidental new investment vehicles structured.

Not one person anywhere accountable atrocities.

The employee buying slaves boss told him.

His manager subject whims Executives, losing job upon showing sentimentality.

The Executive, elected Board, overthrown prove wasteful compromising achieving returns shareholders Board represents.

The Board answers shareholders, placed faith make decisions maximize returns.

The shareholders bought shares company companies, focused making money. nothing money returning certificate uncertain returns. Retirement home/nursing homes most. fucked back March 20-30 deaths place, sure better...

But better prepared now. No. choice have? They’ve chosen nothing unless someone another planet Americans want follow simple guidelines choice participate solution pretend isn’t happening, isn’t bad, won’t kill you.  That’s plan. herd immunity fancy way saying “good fucking luck getting covid finding die” guess works sense. Dont worry. shit work well flu sure wont work well covid. significantly worried pollution gets spewed air rather essentially medicated sneeze... Ooooooh, opportunity brag. Well, good you, well! 

Stop strawmans. literally put quotes around something never said. think poor people need aid. think that’s coming? Would vote it? Remember, people envy they’re dumb, lazy, stubborn. would agree that?

Edit- edit posts fact too. stay home, dude. Don’t suddenly act like care poor people think government care them. one gives shit stay home asking anything. Millions people travel every week, educate look busy airports African countries be, it’s it’s spreading community transmission imported cases This. something complain about. don’t feel like downplayed, winter time much worse viruses. treated like March. It’s going get better next months. Unnecessary, diverts supplies legitimate use. Wow, 135000 people fell windows year? Must conspiracy Belarus women. Coronavirus fuck. 28 days later.

Yeah said it. So...reading comp isn’t thing then? literally wrote we’re working voting people out. also gave valid reason it’s harder “vote politician...”.  precisely change things? First line meet God. death rate surpasses hospitalisation rate? 
What utter nonsense think type? 

Most people Severe intensive care either. Obvious troll obvious.

At least try make funny. Depends vaccine. MMR stings bit.  numbers? France 100,000 cases week sure wash clothes?


Oh humanity! Muh Rights!


No wonder Make American Ghosts Abundant crowd upset. point.

Lockdown significantly reduced cases deaths

We reopened

They rose again

If need second one, openly admitting first one (which went quite well) work solution stopping virus. Well imagine every person immune. Imagine effect would I've heard he's self-proclaimed stable genius. Money abstraction levels. Printing money brings hyper-inflation countries it, creating currency balances.

In global pandemic, whole world could easily ‘pretend didn’t happen’ quarters, central banks printed directly or, cant, bought ‘perpetual bonds’ nominal rates

Most countries isn’t vaccine people still move on. casedemic  different they've saying months. entire subreddit creamed. funny many people sub willing take trial gets approved they're like way gave announcement come home March everyone still learning meant. Picking moving weeks country settled in, job, maybe kids schools trivial decision. 

Because cap numbers (imposed government) pretty much buy business class ticket right now. far understand gov offering loans (not contributions) eye wateringly high planr tickets + hotel quarantine. That's really great option jobless global recession. Also 280,000 people suffering heart attacks go hospital hospitals closed everyone covid patients.

Unfortunately, probably people get surgery transplant couple months hospitals unnecessarily procedures due covid (in stark contrast hospitals resources available actually busy emergency covid cases), can't imagine number high. get necessary procedure covid legitimately overwhelming hospitals... well, calling covid death certainly accurate, undeniably real consequence covid lockdowns. course was. Howard Zinns epic work history ""A Peoples History United States"" lays bare fact anyone read learn about. transfer power one group aristocrats landed gentry another hardly considered true revolution modern sense, power transfers classes. Also, work laid anti-revolutionary mindset founding fathers thier bloody brutal physical opposition burgeoning class issues period. Troll account, lead exciting life. everyone else go back normal

Conditional government's willingness ease restrictions *right away* upon release vaccine. seem likely, Dr. Fauci et al. recommending all. mention case, common populace probably getting access vaccine late spring early summer. anyone pro lockdown point mind boggling 

There dozens, hundreds serology tests prove beyond doubt, virus even 1/10th bad presumed lockdowns started. flu many times deadly COVID people age 25 (this undeniable fact). overall survival rate COVID 99.7% general population goes 99.98 60 (most recent CDC numbers)

Haha trump another 4 years! Joe Biden said xenophobic stop travel China! Huh? haven’t disciplined yet coordinated national scale, clock hasn’t even started ticking. That’s point. political it’s gotten, doubt it’ll ever happen either. So, it’ll need vaccine instead. !RemindMe 160 days threatening us!?!

I worked medical pre-Covid times, mid 2015 2017.

The company worked contracts employers insurance companies ran web portal could generate lab requisitions, login people view lab test results online results streamed server lab. closer data-source was. access employee lists (updated every 6 months), easier time matching lab test data correct person. Social security number still reliable way correct women changed last names though. Still bit crazy, since number lab tests huge barely manageable even back then.

I can't imagine hectic nowadays. *yawns* well fun staying like forever then, everyone else go back normal cause isn’t end world.

Makes perfect sense cancel everything forever virus 0.4-0.6% IFR /s Chem trails I’m 18, nurses always surprised reaction lol, hate guilt tripping thing too, it’s annoying. vaccine needle idk I’ll ngl looking envy?

Most people. making 6 figures saved money instead spending lavishly, see lot people around asking give anything?

Anyone says ""going back work instead demanding government aid solution viral epidemic"" telling every member society go back work.

So did.

Poor people demanding aid, one cares stay home. continual rolling lockdowns, happening continues threatened across world cause hunger deep poverty.

No, government refusing aid causing that. open businesses, businesses going sued existence within years can't wish away deadly virus telling poor people infect with.

There's enough food make hands hungry kids. Fact matter is, leaders give shit would rather let kid starve means financial gain.

Frankly we're 20+ years overdue transition mostly-remote work anyways. virus merely forcing us implement solutions sooner corporate masters wanted.  husband laughs can’t believe scared always holds hand one forcing outside. ""you guys"". involved those. There’s already million doses made, thousands already ready. Yes “normal people” won’t getting first high risk health care workers will. Anything decreases hospitalizations deaths good enough get us back normal. We’re trying ERADICATE virus. we’re six months there’s (less ten) cases reinfection.

Do see people struggling right now? People without jobs. people dealing depression abuse. People missing livelihoods. Vaccine not, things going back normal. existing living, people take much this. What? No. agreeing making joke. 😂😂😂 chronic illness called hyperadrenergic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. number shitty physical symptoms, also causes brain fog. suuuuuuucks. 

I used pretty smart. Honors/AP classes, near perfect SATs, college scholarship. got sick progressively gotten worse, especially last five years.

The brain fog makes attention span super short. 90% time walk room get something, can’t remember I’m there, even though ten seconds passed since decided go get it. can’t keep track time. I’ll completely forget I’m talking middle sentence. Learning *very* slow difficult. Every sentence read least three times absorb it. past year so, I’ve started making grammar mistakes haven’t made since childhood. used big stickler there/they’re/their, to/too/two, etc. would’ve *never* gotten wrong before, I’ve caught more. 

Being “smart” big part was, myself, people. feel dumb front them. It’s frustrating husband forget things asks do, can’t follow shows/movies wants watch together, can’t really conversations complex topics easily used to.

Brain fog really tough. hope it’s temporary folks. goal life prevent infectious diseases

That appears Big Medicine's goal point, they're going let anyone get way. They'll rid US population infectious disease even means putting us poorhouse. say especially means putting us poorhouse. Prove liberals: Follow science! 
WHO: lockdowns harm good, solid data showing masks really help either. oh mortality rate .6%(average age death 82) sorry scaring everyone 
liberals: Yes it’s even covid studying. also doesn’t control possibilities - like people reuse masks may less attentive aspects hygiene. That's good analogy would think way worse, tbh. mouths gross constantly breathing collecting sorts stuff masks. took shower putting underwear could reasonably confident *that* gross wearing hours. Definitely can't say mask haha virus falls apart within day food, paper, clothes.

This article study found lasted much longer surfaces. know, like title says. ever thought people would complain imprisoned. don’t know genuine bed wetter troll think economy impact human lives it’s travesty allowed vote 
(I read post history got 😂😂 keep good work) Please enlighten posting links. lab studies please. Ideally correlation covid something else backlog tests dumped system couldn’t handle it. ‘trolling’ you?

you say statistical argument, assume things? that’s works, give proof.

and also, ‘common knowledge’ talking about? never heard within 1 sq km lab, thought common viewpoint originated food market Las Vegas mayor still Carolyn Goodman, kook wanted keep city open ""control group"" shutdown. might seem logical, ""grandma"" *isn't* fully aware risks, ends getting medical trouble? Wtf.... HOAAAXX FAKE NEWS!!!! WOOHOOOO \o/ \o/ fjiopedssajfoi;eajfio;eahjwio;f supported lockdowns thought fatality rate 3% hospitals overflowing. Now? much. support restrictions, like indoor mass gatherings, don’t support lockdowns. also support WFH possible support use masks. possible testing done exposed people see get sick. However, whole point contact tracing contact people know potentially exposed, tested. catch many asymptomatic cases, limit spreading. White House refused CDC help contact tracing Rose Garden, I'm really sure many people actually got tested event. spoke king priest: ""You keep dumb, keep poor.""  Lock proven effective method far. vaccine reduces symptoms may reduce chance infect others well. See \- less serious symptoms, fewer people infected. crowded places people sharing one home? Kids showing pre school coughing sick parents questioned forbidden say ""oh knew sick errands run"" joke Thursday someone said this.

Add many counties blatantly breaking mask protocols, drove dog vet that's next county one person wearing mask (now gotta find new vet). guess still ""hoax"" there. get plenty spread. Still Oregon better example getting high even protocols place people pushing harder open schools. account biggest increase yet happens. Noooooo way. Give shot please. method vaccination many problems, wind contagious disease vaccinated spread others. Granted, small chance, compared injection chance essentially zero, stick me. really bad. well Republicans finally turned states bloody red. smh

Just look graph, .. block auto mod. hoax. /s I'm sure that, germany called Kurzarbeitergeld (~shortened worktime compensation) helped us alot economic downfall 2008/09. 

Basically, economy put pause everything left place, ready kick instantly keeping employed workforce current jobs either partially completly cut work hours state/state social inssurance jumps pays significant potion salary employers stead; whenever demand goods company produces comes back instantly start catching demand, everything left been.

Especially highly specialized skilled jobs like engineers electricians german car industry way dealing crisis godsend gift economy, noone let go save company workforces rebuild said companies, able return normal became possible.

We're using tool extensively atm, obvious reasons, unemployment barely risen, well self-employed people basically received aid state pay fixed costs like rent. personal favorite wearing mask 15 feet walk restaurant bar taking soon sit down. wonder many covid cases practice prevented. It’s pain lasts fraction second. think dental anesthesia far worse. please call Gavin Newsom’s office tell this? vaccines phase III trials currently manufactured. Even one approved, enough vaccinate, least US, end March. multiple vaccines approved timeline shrinks. 

And people start getting vaccinated, cases/ deaths start dropping shortly after. No, won’t light switch it’s either much like dimmer. start return normal.

Travel foreign countries one last things return unless come “vaccinated” passport. even then, talking certain countries less travel. major tourist destinations vaccinated fairly quickly. may able go London Paris maybe cities. countries successfully eliminated COVID 19 primarily lockdowns.

true, eliminate virus lockdown. Flumist already exists alternative delivery flu vaccines, would think crazy? Damn. Sorry learn this. Hopefully avoid it. I've quarantine pretty strictly, even nervous hug 80 y/o father small get-together last week. wore mask anytime close physical contact him, ridiculous might felt. Imagine vaccine parties take they've made available. 

People go special raves first spray vaccine air everyone mdma collapses floor massive cuddle puddle deprived physical contact long.

What times! partial defense anywhere near stupid could been. follow rules months, ""small gathering"" politicians told acceptable again. many GOP leaders giving people way much rope - enough hang with.

They lying course ""just barely"" following rules people open flouting them. tinfoil head people scream agony hear vaccines ait without knowing... Well, matter stupid think antivaccers are, think I'd ever want give governments possibility secretly dose citizens drugs mosquitoes. severe phobia...there rational reason blood pressure craters whenever injection yet does. I've passed around conversation needles before. I'm one delusional people got bad cough coworker back March everything starting playing ""Was it"" since. went hard Vitamin suspect helped little bit. could head.  Australia heard someone NPR saying washing mask every use like washing underwear wear them. It’s pain wash every time hearing never forget it. Lol bring “the economy” 🙄🙄 Almost nobody following Swedish model. 
Most countries way experience actually tracking spread infections. Since summer, many countries managed catch least 50% infected tracking testing. People even put tiny bit fabric mouthes noses minutes buying groceries, makes think people would get stabbed arm? 

A nasal spray would lot less intimidating hope ones claimed hoax insisted endangering everyone else around die COVID-19 betterment country.

And think that's harsh, tell someone cares. r /politicalcompassporn

Its real wild Sounds like something trump whould say taking vacations 

We actually lot people go holiday Europe throughout summer, idea US though. somehow become politicized hell, we’ll learn bunch politicians invested needle companies, syringes become week’s epitome patriotism, want ride, please... CDC reputable source? People wear masks time. lot? many where’s source? levelled mean die get sick? 
For 40s good health deaths ridiculously low. least somebody control lives. people - especially asked nicely spreading virus.

We rules break house. rules spill garbage garden. rules molest people street. much ask infect disease? Unless works like polio. can't know presymptomatic mild vector/super spreader (about 25%), keep shed little nothing viral infection never feel (over 70% polio) unlucky minority severe need hospital care large numbers people even asymptomatic ones show permanent lung damage blood vessel famage, cardiac issues even neuronal ones.

This extremly misleading. 

It might apply retired risk group, ""you"".

People 15-40 age range even hospitalized 90-99% time. like China testing importations frozen food... unlikely get infected surfaces food/drink. "" clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found may helpful remember virus enter body ACE2 receptor, abundant lungs, therefore breathing next people quite risky. otherwise difficult virus enter body. Beautiful. kind ideas give renewed hope. 

Not get this, innovate new drugs strengthen prolong human life.

I love science. winning? honestly believe ton anti-vaxxers came conclusion kids cried 42 seconds getting shot it’s momentarily

.... yes, long lockdown. stop lockdown resume life without precautions virus still going didnt fully lockdown lacked adequate testing come see country going second general lockdown net effect negative. 

Uh.. france?  don’t understand lot people dying lockdowns

As someone serious health issues fully aware problems creates. condescending. must consider total effect number covid deaths given time point. extended period.

Yeah, problem government fails lacks leadership. people wear masks covid would control now. find cdc quotes saying want. Thanks employing “no true Scotsman fallacy” response. Since supposed “listen scientists,” able supply scientific results support installation barriers. Oh great they’re going infringe right refuse vaccines spraying country planes unlikely get infected surfaces food/drink. "" clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found may helpful remember virus enter body ACE2 receptor, abundant lungs, therefore breathing next people risky. number ACE2 receptors mouth much lower, chance virus linger long enough mouth bind one would quite close zero. Take care. shhhhhhhh oh yes, would know? isn’t true. Surgical masks mitigate spread. Masks ”useless” people don’t wear them

In Colorado, confirm.  Lol beat virus do, precaution. Honestly saw video rats scurrying coke cans warehouse I’ll probably forever. 

Amazon packages let sit door days unless need I’ll wipe down. I’ve also gotten pretty good touching face. comparison point, simply coming something easily determine false terrible comparison. math equation *. anything else go results given here. likely selection bias know severe noted. fits pretty close many estimates maybe bad. also poor reporting deaths directions, nothing going perfect, go see try collect together came comments section bearing popcorn article seems suggest (I might wrong, someone correct I’m misunderstanding) cloth masks need washed use since could contaminated virus, one could infect touching virus. However, growing evidence fomite transmission incredibly rare happens all, doesn’t undermine article? visiting public restroom long time now, never fan.

Can anyone said fan public restrooms? ; ) miss point entirely. 

The article taking virus seriously, social distancing mask wearing. Keeping economy moving taking reasonable health precautions mutually exclusive. Yup that's ZERO sympathy people. continue deny affects personally. people come crap like nearly always liberal arts graduates like idea science, see way win dinner table arguments boomer family members.

Indeed. people never done science, really know works, love pull weapon think gives cred feel need ignoring science entire lives. Rebecca Watson ultimate example familiar blogger. sent thots sprayers agree many NY, NJ, plates past two weeks. need lock down. people vacationing pandemic??? WHATABOUT 
WHATABOUT implying factor goes 'worse' mortality rate. lots factors make much worse flu, ebola, smallbox. 

How easily infection spread? effective treatments/vaccines? many severe cases require hospitalization? long term effects survive? long illness last moderate severe cases people recovered enough get back work? long immunity last? mutate regularly void previous immunity? 

Ebola, example, crazy high death rate 50%, spread easily modern hygiene infrastructure. that, always kind nothingburger media hype fearmongering. Lockdowns obviously helped. Florida breaking revords daily deaths new york basically covid free summer Dont dismiss Czechia 8600 cases, US numbers: 266,000 one day... (in France would 53k cases). Czechia 37 % positivity rate. :( I'm definitely wearing fear. I've severe pneumonia get steroids help breathing trust want it, neither I. Alabama mostly Democrat country elected Black president. solidly republican ever since. 

 attitudes changed - party affiliations. Nobody room wearing hat, 34 people infected Corona virus. proves worn hats would never caught Corona virus. deaths elderly long-term-care. average long-term-care patient dies within 6 months admission. 

most covid deaths tragic.  order confirmed need infection genome sequenced confirmed second infection due slight changes covid something along lines. high standard. suspected cases stuff never done, number actually likely higher due high level proof required. lot cheaper easier assume reactivation reinfection, interestingly enough good number cases reinfection happened long initial infection.

If immunity longer 2 years mild moderate cases I'll astounded. feeling like year mild/moderate two years bad cases, shall see. hope long I'm going hold breath. mean ... vaccines effective kills many people certain health conditions, people already scarred previous bouts ... could lot next 5 - 10 years.  


Think many people already vulnerable, age high risk demographic, become obese enough high risk. people high risk today, everyone high risk perpetuity. ""We know"" irrelevant. literally suicidal trapped house 4 months, apparently matter 801 According virus tiny mask stop, explain virus never floating around itself, it’s carried water droplets big enough mask catch. virus pretty weak. It’s wrapped protective shell easily destroyed carried water droplet. 

That’s 2 second hand wash plain soap destroy shell easily. shell compromised virus exposed almost immediately longer threat. 

It’s water droplets carrying virus shell problem. helps protect virus further, masks help stop virus ridden water droplets. 

I explain usually respond something like...oh Biden didn’t wear mask day....

It’s frustrating! 

I honestly believe it’s Q’Anon spreading crap point it’s problem

Apparently mom following Facebook groups (I almost died told me)

She said stopped following got crazy wearing masks (again I’m like THATS MADE TOU STOP FOLLOWING THEM? think ppl like Tom Hanks kidnapping kids fondle drink blood)

Anyway...my kids step mom calls day raving mad saving kids pedophiles see trafficking. I’m like ooookay...

Then made connection shes Q’Anon ex think hoax anti mask

It’s crazy Q’Anon become big it’s become threat...of course Trump won’t anything think he’s savior arrest “deep state”

Seriously I’m still shock real I'm past ashamed I'm disgusted angry. I'm moved CA CO specifically fires climate change I'm evaluating moving Canada Germany. 

America absolutely WORST country responding disaster. SERIOUS catastrophe... want raise kids here... Video games kept stable. still go to. 

Hope well. Great 
Although scientists can’t control many confounding variables human populations, animal studies. Researchers led microbiologist Kwok-Yung Yuen University Hong Kong housed infected healthy hamsters adjoining cages, surgical-mask partitions separating animals. Without barrier, two-thirds uninfected animals caught SARS-CoV-2, according paper7 published May. 25% animals protected mask material got infected, less sick mask-free neighbours (as measured clinical scores tissue suggests another possible benefit: people get mild cases, might help enhance immunity population level without increasing burden severe illness death. can't fix stupid mods apparently complicit? Username checks out. know right! can’t wait governors like Cuomo, Murphy, Newson, foreign leaders like Macron, Xi, face time unspecific crimes. Maybe Pelosi DeBlasio face criminal prosecution encouraging people go pandemic! Oh ok, I've worked decently sized sql databases, I'm programmer trade I'll defer you. Yeah I'm Melbourne too, although lockdown tough fucking good see actually working. Proud fellow melbournians. got this. Also mortality dropped treatments improved things manageable hospitals full.

The lockdowns bought time treatments get better. supposed also buy us time testing get better PPE become available know failed us that. wait Chinese wet markets reopen get start SARS-Cov 3. Thank you.  Wear fucking mask. 

Social distance. 

Wash hands frequently.

Don't go to. 

Be kind. concept ""American"" gone window. People Republicans Americans, Democrats, whatever party/word. There's much ""us vs them"" ""insert group taking me"" whatever. used sense solidarity (history horrific racism, sexism, like aside) completely gone window. People longer care best America Americans, community whole, people whole - care people like them, think way do, believe things believe. dangerous precedent sending us dark road. think things bad - - wait see we're ten years nothing significant changes.

I desperately hope Biden wins makes sweeping changes, half job (if more) going undoing damage rather making actual progress based this, another part terrified going radicalize side even more. things become normal - government bodies outright scheming eachother, willingly hurting population strike blow opposition party, everything else another example said - affiliation comes first. American back seat member certain party, group, belief, religion, whatever else.

What makes worse blind belief best country world default. take continuous effort hard work, always wrong everything justified. delusion rest world still looks us shining light leadership democracy beyond me.

At end day still wonder people genuinely believe things tout know ridiculous insanity stick personally benefits somehow. hard believe people absurdly stupid, hateful, xenophobic, racist, thousand terms describes shit going down.

To people disagree - that's totally cool, entitled opinion.

Edit: I'm terrified potential ASE post, I've never gotten super cool star thanks whoever gave it. still unite defeat enemy soil, vote fucking hate Donald Trump, CDC cannot held blameless monumental failure response COVID-19 pandemic. I’ll NEVER forget telling worried mother even bother trying procure masks Korea.

I told CDC said masks ineffective likely cause infection bc people would fiddle much. come bullshit trying preserve masks frontline workers.

The Dem leadership also dropped ball, telling ppl go Chinese festival.

Trump sucks. CDC sucks. Everyone sucks. clusterfuck. handling techniques far anything new

my sense ignorant stuff, even pretty seasoned clinicians unaware kinds logistical hurdles involved something 'simple' maintaining vaccine temperatures. 

but hurdles matters mass behavior change, individual &amp; institutional, movement phenomena waaaay fantasy timetable.

So start eating words now. French given up. mean first time. remember early post someone saying concerned one important stat: 0 deaths outside China.

At time thought made sense, diseases recognize borders. way could find comment now, occasionally wonder person thinking now. Friend mine saw mask said “This mask useless governor.”

I don’t understand political either. job making wear one 40+ hours week., enforcing customer use well. want keep everyone safe. I’m exposed many people day, mall, state cases really bad right now. health department locations don’t want job close this. None political, it’s common sense. I'm Massachusetts, city side boston 4th highest population per square mile. live artic city known grand forks now. Since moving I've heard ""I believe science"" sentence know existed. ignorance get job market insane. Get fox news, pick history book, learn something. Yes, sorts reasons ""we can't"".

We need reasons ""we can"". Apparently Fired black people White House staff. Hey friend. share frustration. spent entire year described well, including real life friends family. ridiculed scoffed everyone knew, yet are. really sucks. taken quite mental/emotional toll time. Especially goddamn fucking mask thing. frustration easily took 5 years lifespan. Nowadays completely walled outside world try relax brain. I'm post title looked interesting, normally ignore reddit notifications. point alone. Hopefully general public **eventually** catches up. Hopefully...

Soon. second now. Hold bit longer... wait it... almost there... comes....... wants move Greenland? one that. large face form well. probably lower number lagging behind updates Mack, 29, worked children's cancer unit Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary NHS 111, self-isolating called ambulance died arrived. sounding like Covid induces lupus hosts. Bro snowflake didn’t like said Wrong state... Well that's idiotic comment many countries recommended masks *AND* crowding malls buses. Finally!! I've keep mouth shut time fear offending someone (hospital employee). HATE IT. South Dakota North Dakota Want know really sad fact compare too?

Motorcycles really dangerous right? Well COVID19 killed Americans 7 months entire living history motorcycles USA.

How sad that? actively dangerous Motorsport activity less deaths 118+ years... pandemic could controlled 7 months.

That's insane ask me. Absolutely unreal, unacceptable. think dropped this

""Much popularity monthly emergency aid payments £83 ($108) – £166 ($217) single mothers – 67 million Brazilians began receiving April."" think part southern states warmer summer people inside virus spreads easily. That’s say things wouldn’t much better mask mandate too. two compound other. alcohol concern? fully agree. sure you’re trying say last part? shouldn’t cost anything remove damn text boxes make people email copy credentials adding list. labor guess fit narrative sir job wear masks. agree, I’m Ontario. I’m definitely relaxing anytime soon. think there’s much selfish thought going on... everyone starts looking societal sense could suppressed big margin. going better controlling virus letting spread. major study showed economies fare best control virus. posted here. government's moronic messaging beginning 2020. Turned absolute disaster world realized masks reduce spread also reduce viral load severity. can't believe still people clinging ideas.  Awesome. 90k fewer votes Trump come Nov 3! Go China! Woohoo! 22 seems low, especially something get once.

Really small sample size draw conclusions from... might wrong given comorbidities I'm guessing wearing mask socially distancing Trump gave covid (masks shown lead milder cases), chances anywhere near good turned given remdesivir early. people see distraction seeing horrible news every day home takes bit toll mind. lockdown, F1 continue fantastic bubble idea kept stable. yes, full crowd right Florida nothing short absurd. I'm thinking talk got focus great therapeutics days. like spanish flu killed way people corona virus, back kind advanced modern medicine technology. ^^^/sincasethatwasntcompletelyobvious total deaths per capita Sweden vs Denmark Norway? Masks known reduce viral load reduces severity infection. Dr. Dick Inbuhts must too? so-called “patriots”. Nothing learned/changed since 1918 flu anti-maskers. repeat. Even lessons learned since spring ignored lot comes people caring anybody themselves. 100% accurate!!! let Democrats 1860s run things!!! means 500 million cases flu every year US. Right. Oh sure. definitely bad actors trying take advantage this, including nurses. saying arent bad actors hypocrisy dude downplaying covid19 yet soaking glory working hospital. Smdh. Considering they've spending time trying roll country's clock back little 160 years, makes sense. point learning progress want destroy Let’s hope quarantine stops transmission. way morgue according doctors I’m sure impact, think real cause likely colder weather forcing people inside making people like runny noses frequently. happens regulations laxed, get spike. cause claim proof something obvious.

Proof ""obvious""? plenty proof share since ""obvious""

So far *definitely* living irrefutable fact you... got Remdesivir, heard, people too. think got antibody cocktail, people gotten outside clinical trials. Like telling depressed person stop sad. Oh see shit like too. Burns up. We'll, maybe can't validate credentials, publish it.

How hard would randos sign something? probably cost money build system could service web traffic thousands randos trolls. takeaway paid Trump's care, Christie's. flu kills approximately 40-50,000 Americans year, .01% IFR, means 400 million cases flu. country 330 million. Wow. interesting. Tell more. logistics testing everyone antibodies feasible right now. tried pooled testing, way would effective vast majority infected. vast majority infected know work, detailed data fairly pointless already know need know. Almost one infected.

Getting numbers low enough test many people possible regularly devote resources pooled testing contact tracing scale back restrictions shut downs point targeted instead blanketing. 18-minute rally. suspect he's better fatigue usual.  argument won’t diminish people job experiencing mental physical breakdowns go through. 

Despite fact (and definitely fact) science anticipated pandemic (the “when” always unknown factor), pretty much entire globe caught proverbial pants down. better preparation place, those, like yourself, wouldn’t still work. truly believe this. overall response appears chaotic disparate. hope you’re able find work soon! Fauci thinks wearing mask getting coronavirus proves wearing mask would prevent getting coronavirus. right tells dumb is. also live Missouri tonight old school friends posting FB group want meet January. far I'm one hell no'ed post. Remember America could everything better every part world? Yeah, either, read history books. unstoppable powerhouse country, cold war seemingly made us best country could really weird think about. need new spectre doom villainy point unite against^like^regressive^neoconservative^politicians. 6 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday.

The lone serious condition patient China stabilised. lot colder weather people packing inside. Hopefully death rates stay like last year. expect rosy ""we great therapeutics now!"" spin it. may fear death, not. *shhh let moment* I’m man faith. man science.  Science says masks work. Debate over. Victoria, australia. get $450 stay home waiting test results don’t sick leave. found positive don’t enough sickleave again, get payment $1500 cover two week isolation. 

People selfish hell.

Edit: formatting spent last 3.5months road tripping country. people haven’t cared since June. Short term gains long term losses. American way. remember age thought one else anything else mattered F everyone didn’t agree. grew thankfully much wholesome mature person now. Hopefully well don’t unknowingly infect someone lead someone’s death along way. It’s clear you’re hateful others wish harm us issues sake partying. study says isn’t Fauci said back February.  One reason could ICU definition different country country. really isn't, masks never stopped spread begin with. great example would Democrats/ANTIFA/the KKK rioted around America masks. number cases still went up. wear mask give less shit get it. Heart disease far dangerous virus. Masks work everyone wears they're effective transmission worn sick person. Choosing wear one prove somebody tough, proves give fuck anyone.  We’ve also bastardized terms freedom liberty mean selfish narcissistic mean either awful flu maintaining antibodies like Dr's wonder? people never learned thing lives, fathom idea someone else learning something. Yeah shit. suspect we'll 75-80k range per day next couple weeks. Seems ton people tired taking precautions. I'm seeing traveling, family visits, restaurant outings. Even amongst people decently verbal acknowledgement virus severity it. Hey friend random question; without giving personal info course, consider old millennial young GenX? asking pure curiosity someone recovered Corona, would describe symptoms like flu. Started headache fever, sinus infection. exactly happened got flu 7 years ago. SarsCov-2 virus unusual. doesn’t behave way influenza many coronavirus behave. vascular disease destroys epithelial cells creates havoc body. Clotting, runaway inflammation. Cascade organ failure. person’s immune system can’t keep ahead virus bad things happen don’t see influenza. sense superiority exactly Covid control Western countries. think Florida interesting case though. reliant tourism sales tax revenue. easy virus re-enter state visitors even got situation control.  Masks primarily protect everyone ELSE. screwed though people don’t give 2 shits one another.  really sick begin with. could make believable showing sick hell hospital bed. still seen anything make believe really sick. everything took, may precautionary measures. nothing believable him, there's transparency.  bugging much, actually went WHO's site filled ""contact us"" page, looking clarification link data.

I expect reply nobody. But, can't back up, maybe I'll contact good Dr directly. I'm sure email. People allowed go get tested know/suspect they've exposed. Got puppy months ago. drinking heavily puppy goes sleep.

\#PandemicPupper

\#PoochHooch wanted point studies.

We still studies shit seems obvious clinically time. often find nuances help assign values various components problem, determine component important combat first.

We even repeat studies confirm get results (reproducible).

But yes, anybody regular conversation acts like still discussion ulterior motive Edited:
Apparently lab gave state 400k results need deduplicated fixed. said nothing vice president lol ""it works"" never viable netherlands, sucked whole way Guys think I've changed mind... two trolls feedback loop. 🤣 Well tell Fauci. He's one [quoted claiming studies fulfill RCT requirements ""flawed"". word chose use: ""flawed"". suboptimal, questionable weak, ""flawed"". every scientific medical study drug trial, believe demanding: demanding observations illness exclusively tied double-blind drug studies, observations ever used considered valid.

I'm certainly not, Fauci is. See above. RCT Covid long term sequela would use two groups randomly chosen receive either placebo virus, followed time tracking symptoms. kind study Fauci thinks flawed randomized, placebo-controlled blinded. Anything short that, according Fauci, flawed might well ignored, even peer-reviewed.

Hilariously though, Fauci says masks work demands wear them, laws passed enforce this, even though placebo-controlled randomized trial showing effective prevention Covid-19 exist, 6 feet social distancing. Thus Fauci hypocrite lied Congress oath. know religion needs go away. Kinda weird tbh. miracle. cases deaths Florida! 

In seriousness, what's deal that? reporting certain days now?   god, people hung that? realize science understanding things changes evolves, changes approach solving problems? thought like you, people would think earth flat. Unfortunately people dumb enough believe today.  would reply reply take account account everything he's said said context context.  supported support now, case politics. Politicians lose base base go looking eat, base enough money food shelter, keep base.

The reason many upsets political world many surprise winners minority think logically minority assumes people do.

This works. 

Here Florida nice vibrant Brazilian community. wife works many them, says majority think Bolsonaro good job world follow lead. words. leader small businesses wouldn’t fucked fucking Senate would get worthless asses approve aid. Another day, another disgrace America  Winter coming. true. Many many cases fogginess, loss senses, heart lung scarring... ""We're really seeing number reports people report long-term fatigue, headaches, vertigo (and), interestingly enough, difficulties cognition, hair loss, cardiac issues, diminished cardiorespiratory fitness. think we're going find large portion ― all, large portion ― likely relate significant cellular-level damage virus cause,"" says Dr. possible long-term effects affect even patients asymptomatic mild cases asymptomatic patients hospitalized observation. Fifty-seven percent showed lung abnormalities CT scan, sensitive imaging technique produces three-dimensional picture lungs. showed ""striped shadows,"" others presented ""ground-glass opacities"" — clear signs inflammation findings suggest future could non-negligible proportion patients, possibly young age, need thoracic RT undiagnosed pre-existing cardiopulmonary damage asymptomatic COVID-19. Lagging indicators new COVID tests like? Heard stopped using ones go nose? started using new ones easier less invasive product 2-3 generations never sacrifice anything live kind difficult times. 10,000 deaths last 3 months. guess really trying hard again.  understand people businesses bars financially hurt interest keeping things open, need crowds football game. something need. super spreader event making. wear one ball game. Yes masks work course. can't prove negative.

(I know masks work) logically prove negative? always amazes reasonably intelligent people (there must Arizona) simply unable read data elsewhere learn it. Nope, gotta stick hand fire know hot. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Illinois quietly jumped 2k almost 3k cases per day. even gotten cold yet! Yes, mentioned normal basic cover. also temporarily changed things like:

\- Unemployed funds (through unions, state pays of) easier eligible for, usually need join six months, need three.

\- Unemployment fund raised \~$136/1200SEK per day instead $102/910SEK first 100 days.

\- Usually get paid first sick day, do.

\-Usually need doctors note 8 days, 21, questions asked - stay home feel even slightly ill.

\- Employers furlough state pays 60% salary, work less get slightly less salary - companies downsize, valid reason kick staff.

\- Self employed pay pension tax till $11400 profits, \~10% instead \~29% (this company form sucks compared limited company, promised things)

These things top head. lots measures taken keep life ""normal"" terms incomes spending.

So US get Swedish basic normal security net would need biggest reform history economics welfare. yes - also need trust government people.  Sorry break CO often much better fires. air quality shit since August fires burning. Germany best option. Remindme! 6 months even worse actually. Last week old man killed asked another bar patron put mask. They're refusing wear masks themselves, they're perpetrating violence do. worry home, honestly. People live likely intimate. restrict visiting numbers homes. worry work social gathering well. work, even visitors admin workers (non-clinical employees) wear masks service high risk.

This highlights Covid-19 response political. Literally, governments jobs right countries less casualties cases. downvotes here. People wanting hopeful downvote true. 

The problem painful truths best swallowed small bites. People handle ""another 100 days"" another, another another much better saying ""another 400 days"" really seems like real projection Yeah, expected. reading comprehension. Glad lost argument though. bet. lovely day!!  They're tech news site. IPhones, computer stuff, tv's, home audio, stuff like that. front page story best electronic deals Amazon Prime Day.

Politics something would ever expect see BGR. works too. anti-maskers cowards, could refuse ring suddenly theft folks pointed issues data analysis, corrected findings change significantly upon review. wish would let nonbelievers walk halls ICU ER. know March/April described day like ER nurse, people looked like made story. people need look person struggling breath eye order see horrific covid is. need see people getting dropped family pushed back outside hospital doors. nonbelievers “it’s freedom” bullshitters make call family telling loved one intubated dead. 


This happened every day weeks part state. yet people still don’t believe enough wear mask. cares letting hospital dangerous could end spreading disease. It’s like person taking matters stop spread life. Let fully immerse maybe would make real changes life help stop spread. becomes even ridiculous see many anti-maskers also think covid sort bio-attack Chinese Democrats something. Taken logical conclusion...they think US attacked bioweapons, yet refuse help defend nation lol.

(of course comes back conspiracy nuts like believe multiple, conflicting conspiracies) lmao bodied optimistic want hope right. distant future, people going really confused mildly scornful look history textbook read anti-maskers. It’ll like read witch hunts today. Woodrow’s policies located fair, lot ideas pretty progressive time like 8 hour workday railroad workers creating income tax help fund war. cut tariffs reformed banking rules (federal reserve) maybe labels people 1914 don’t apply. 

People pretend republicans still party Lincoln insane though. every Dixiecrat join republicans then? living rock? Montreal red alert back lockdown sounds like 400 days point right number. 2022 closest normal us medical workers us lost young loved ones unexpectedly never return naivety innocence pre covid. forever altered obviously, mask won’t completely suppress virus, slow spread Yea Keqiang index interesting dude said isn’t representative services industry China growing industrial index doesn’t accurately measure that. believe made new one new one old one show significant gdp growth past 10 years China (still bit lower reported). There’s doubt China’s economy growing significantly though, faking would impossible given world economy relies other. Also idea TYT is. Looks like reality tv show? sure mentioned it. hurtin freedumbs! Cops willing enforce it, need private security. It’s antisemitism say it’s antisemitism. call antisemite are. Case closed. tried look failed got lazy am:

What kind news usually report Boy Genius Report?  long American they'll probably accept 2022 Next week, highs 50s 40s lows 20s 30s. know people going inside. air dryer virus hang air longer.  former nurse medical records clerk, I'm familiar, moreso would seem.

It's hard wrong, understand, matlock. Yeah nyc. cop shit environment. Sure, let fine black kids wearing mask. go well. hate right wish could contact Fauci somehow. thank continuing try even face everything that's going on. Wow yall say Karen's fucking stupid? shocked discover anti mask rhetoric funded big corporations

Maybe? least US, large corporations got social distancing / masks bandwagon governments did, others tried keep status quo. (By mention visiting castles I'm going guess might elsewhere?)

Examples I'd give former include Microsoft Google (they employees Seattle working home around week Seattle mayor Washington state governor announced stay-at-home orders) Wal-mart Costco (they nationwide distancing / mask policies stores US federal government said anything official).

For example latter, Boeing tried keep airplane factories running full speed long possible even massive outcry employees. Speculation /r/coronaviruswa governor's delay several days declaring statewide stay-at-home order due political pressure Boeing. know vaccines imminent, right? Letting disco die. Lol, forgetting important stuff! updoot. exactly. order scientifically prove this, would need half attendees wear masks compare difference. people wore masks event, enough statistically significant.

The Rose Garden incident shows get covid wear masks. prove less risk wearing mask.

(btw I'm huge proponent wearing masks. also believe data science, claiming Rose Garden proves masks work bad science.) Yes understand. political movement populist european governments turned religion pressure foreign governments specially developing countries, order gain economic resources European Union. ever hate needles !!! Vouch work, keep things closed weird economic game chicken...got Still much worried about. Ok 200k. 280k Politicians would never ever lmao +10,000 getting worked rational discussion with.  suspect people expected use tap unless one exists.

Covid spread people physical contact (two tables away restaurant) likely breeze air conditioning. Wearing mask (at least data) seem reduce spreading it, sane err safe side. goddamn everyoe. gonna stay locked home day longer absolutely necessary. Well that's choice. fewer cases persist. 3 4 less deaths per capita US, that's despite generally getting hit earlier treatments nearly good. Irrelevant said thanks. Go you! Alright... there's clearly conflict two sides, I'm failing see drinks bleach opposition lockdowns stuff. Trump voters drink bleach?  one saying it’s “cool”. difference gross/unhygienic useless covid unless washed daily. I’m sure bacteria mold grow it’s washed every use that’s increasing risk covid. Give two weeks True, record 3000 cases last week state. Sadly U.S. Make Americans Ghosts Already crowd thinks measure that's 100% fully open, masks all, lockdown.


There's gray area them, probably wants.  China complete lockdown couple months, got everything control, implimented rigours test trace proceedures.

Exactly people saying done first place. stay good restrictions foreign visitors.

Saying lockdowns evidence used wildly irresponsible incorrect.

Additionally, options hospitals starting get overrun despite regulations?

And china still using lockdowns, Jilin Xinjiang? ignoring lockdowns? never knew this, might move UK now... blame Wisconsin Supreme Court. CO(VID-19)nservatives matter, lie public public health advice, undermines confidence future advice. Many anti-maskers using early advice ""evidence"" back view up.  headline meant TOTAL number cases much third largest city, number NEW cases today. That's imagination. facts, kid. recap, far wrong protective immunity, simple mathematics relates case outcomes, cellular immunity vs humoral immunity, long immunity coronavirus infections lasts, qualifies confirmed reinfection... 

If you, I'd probably realize element rather continue triple down. state “database errors” blow mind. It’s 2020. Yes trying conspiracy nut wife idiots. we're supposed believe USA Europe superpowers? even understand climate change is? bet really understand basic concepts. no, really. cloth masks maybe something like 5-10% effective protecting inhaling virus.  cloth masks meant catch droplets breath protect others social distancing work.  course not. 

However, implying 'rounding dissenters shooting heads' dumb fuck. already know like flu. get flu pretty sick days. get COVID small chance really sick, moderate chance flu like symptoms, really good chance symptoms all.

So yeah, definitely flu-like all. Rest Peace 😞💔   Reddit sure getting flooded bunch bullshit inconclusive COVID-19 articles today. [The BBC claim seen think reasonable assume they're legit tabloid bollocks.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* federal level, plenty pressures federal government use get states fall line.

Unfortunately, pressures federal government encourages people get sick.  saying lockdown lol. headline clickbajt. saying use primary source fighting pandemic, last resort. Sounds like good advice me. No, even Swedish conservatives similar US liberals. Perhaps even left them.

Sweden left big government highest taxes high incomes world. ""With winter around corner people spending time indoors, imperative ever counter misinformation clearly communicate risks public; addition, await arrival vaccine, equally important arm public facts."" next virus longer incubation period screwed oven-ready 58. like 23ish years younger average age death. stupid ideas. Loving contribution brainstorm! 🧠⚡️ pick choose listen 1,600 new cases yesterday Michigan. Weighted population that’s equal 3,500 new cases Florida. Michigan noted imposing longest harshest restrictions country. gives? woefully undercounted.

How could possibly undercounted??

Every article I've seen suggests medical examiners practically *reckless* comes attributing deaths covid. So, reinfection known coronaviruses possibility due short term protective immune responses demonstrated Nature Medicine article, one somehow special? Additionally, homologous coronavirus reinfection also shown. But, somehow, one special? Come on. arguing gut rather arguing science.

No actually. argument there’s reason think reinfection present dire problem. realize admitting intention asking questions good faith thing saying useless engage with? Well said, unfortunately many subreddits shrewd, misinformation like would upvoted awards.

Doesn’t help mods heavy lean towards hysteria either... What’s taken account people gas pump across coughing wiping noses going life like nothing wrong ""zombie jobs"" description might apt jobs relying tourism predominantly American visitors.

Most tourists europe come from.... Europe.

E.g. 68 million European tourists come France every year, 3.2 million Americans do. exactly ""predominantly american visitors"". ""as primary source fight pandemic"" in, lockdown. alluding track trace competent system prevent need lockdown, however lockdowns work, seen pretty much every country locked didn't..They're saying lockdown, use means fighting virus. It’s bad flu like Spanish flu It’s nearly impossible eradicate disease animal reservoir. Smallpox polio don’t come animals, influenza does. try stay away people mask hard usually not. 

But ok, whatever say. Brain fog absolute worse. three years ago intermittent brain fog result mild gall bladder issues caused terrible diet. fixed diet started exercising point obsession, problem resolved itself. I'll never forget utterly limiting brain fog felt. Mild dementia good way putting it, feeling can't concentrate focus anything. break probably answer yourself.  course nowhere 100% safe unsafe.

But think it, people breathing hard, huffing puffing either aerobic equipment pushing hard. Sweat common surfaces, benches, equipment. may plenty wipes available effectively people use chemicals enough time kill virus?

It sucks, really does, rank establishments probability, gyms likely worse many places.

Personally, I'm missing gym home workouts help, know same. least though home gathering place people know. 

Good luck. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article I'm worried fast food country even businesses wear masks often places. 
I still eat figured virus easily transmitted food would've died now, concern nonetheless. ironic thread covid misinformation killing everyone top thread anecdotal story covid literally giving dementia, sub fucking joke lmao today saw Hanes Masks 10 $5.99  thats like buying pack underwear, wear it, put wash. Thats US, sure countries access these, easy purchase days they're everwhere.

Every 2 days switch new mask. Since make issues + also trial prototypes make well (someone to), plenty hand. Basically I'm getting 4 hours wear, equates 2 days , time change mask new one.

&amp;#x200B;

Now said, saw someone mentioned masks shrinks. sincerely hope everyone washes masks wearing first time, matter purchase from. Every mask donate put care card inside. firest sentence ""WASH FIRST USE"". sure masks made preshrunk cotton, ask. helps lot keep shinking warping more. Cardio seems kinda important maintain right tho. is\] damaging economy areas public health.   restaurants allowed past 25% capacity lockedown

If ""too damaging"" opinion, statement imply? Nothing else.

In town, several bars spread Corona police abused visitor's lists, many ""Donald Duck""s ""Lucky Luke""s searched I'm guessing nuance talking money.

I agree many people financially stable enough simple stop working, government failing act help mean rest us throw caution wind. government said ""sucks you"" take government, begrudgingly look rest us envy demand give we've worked for.

There's reason physically close contagious viral outbreak be. IV worse. Larger needle done back hand much sensitive blood draws injections. Easily second worst experience needle. Worst badly inflamed ingrown hair leg starting cause blood infection. already painful touch. doctor numbed spot used tip massive needle, like one large barbell piercing needles, cut open infected follicle. Where's lie tho Yes, would. attending local YMCA last two weeks. risk, know, also needed something. don’t even good place walk near me. check temps way (not sure means really means anything though). require masks times except pool. limit many people time practice social distancing times. clean high touch surfaces like crazy. even clean machine expected clean it. classes still hold outside, imagine need come inside soon. medical-grade air purifiers scattered about. Safer would staying home, yes. don’t pool home arthritis needed water....so are. Yes, understand given Rose Garden event, unfortunately isn’t much policy wise detect people like red hat man super spreaders. here, seems like second lockdown table, least now. Government came today restaurants shops remain open new measures announced monday, limit social contact.But I'm doubtful work. problem government bunch corrupt crooks people zero trust them. fact keep changing measures contradict time help.

Not Czech, lot respect decisions took March/April. think situation weird contradict time right now, image coming South American country people goverment idea impending pandemia. False choice. circumstances 1 2 safety protocols fail 3 don't. People w/allergies disagree convience factor defeatists like reason many businesses closed longer two months.

Lockdown absolutely best option proven several scales multiple countries fraction resources U.S. has. decided act political reasons pander people like *you*. U.S. decided help people instead cut taxes funnel money investment bankers PPP, could kept businesses afloat easily. 

All make unemployment boost last end pandemic, freeze rent mortgage payments floating banks.

Boom. problems solved. enough cases two months impliment pooled testing high risk high exposure folks (health care staff, nursing homes, essential workers, schools) tested every day. Back work right away, back true normalcy minus open borders another couple months.

Wouldn't two month shut far better several months back forth closing opening? restaurants better shape allowed open, allowed serve enough customers survive?

You claim care small business, think holding prop care. ""There's NEW Mexico???"" Imo Taiwan handle much better. Taiwan scenes Wuhan. There's always money extract public even crisis  Please computer programer please tell handle pandemic. 

Cant get windows work properly wants authority global pandemics. going shit show. media needs get sued posting alarmist crap like this. knows many they’ve psychologically harmed try push agendas like this... like nobody read article Coronavirus push herd immunity Koch brothers. Yeah, understand data rolls in, timelines change learn best ways tackle hurdles like covid-19.

I think would happy stated assumption, transparent timeline given said assumption.

I.e, assumption vaccine approved January 1 2021, start deliver vaccine general population June 1 2021, expect see characterize normal September 30 2021. assumptions change, update timeline accordingly.

This statement would like see. vague “oh, might long time normal ... maybe never” statements disingenuous don’t help build trust community. Yeah, that's keep saying States, highest death rate world. dead several biggest wars, combined.

Why would believe much hard uncontravertable evidence says wrong? rando like said so? Churches interested money lives, proved it. goes there. Many places locked lot closer back normal places didn't. People talk ""costs lockdown,"" hard tease costs people choosing avoiding going gathering own. anyone think US go back March level shutdowns? continue we’ve slowly opening? Tbh lot bars area packed arm arm nobody seems care. *average* rate transmission higher flu, mean every case infectious.  could high percentage non spreaders much smaller group super spreaders still end high average rate transmission. UK Belgium among ones I'm sure thinking using second lockdown. thought could protect elderly letting everyone else party like it’s 1999? true. 

That blood tests, ALWAYS ask butterfly needle. still ""feel"" it, definitely lot less regular needle. could get “inside body”.


Wouldn't inhumane hamster? Hahaha Chinese-American living American expat China (teaching English) shilling America's pandemic response China without setting foot US. Can't make up.

Meanwhile Chinese-American friends (in America) businesses burned ground arsonists little police investigation. Right. You’ve adjusted new normal. doesn’t mean world pretty much normal

Kids school. They’ve adjusted masks social distancing. That’s normal, they’re ok it

The world seeing unprecendented levels poverty unemployment. hey us jobs adjusted working home 

I’m calling world normal it’s...you know...normal lockdown, aggressive testing contact tracing. Find many infected possible, put quarantine special facility away family test negative. couple weeks get numbers down. 

Then start dividing city segments, mass test segment, i.e. everybody. segments free covid get opened up. free continue lock down. People travel within segments. 

Over time, shrink number people affected lockdown entire city small handful places short periods time. 

This rocket science. Chinese doing. question anyone else thing. BOB Well. ya go. USA officially civilized.  It’s going disappear day now, like someone else. Israel second lock ultra-Orthodox citizen live community like third world 10 kids family.
I'm losing mind point second lockdown might third one December someone phobia works ill take Lmao you’re downvoted. proving point🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Again, look like give shit rules? lol. 0.1, swine flu 0.02 affect elderly much regular flu season front page sub. scroll around bit.
Edit: get this.

Sanders orthodox barely mentioned anything religion running. Biden Catholic think Catholic media backing him. think point possible Washington Examiner taking things context cherry picking. know that's case here, would probably find better sources verify. nypost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nada 👎 yet. Reason response I’m Ontario Canada region went back stage 2 lock gyms closed. back market. pulled couple years reformulated particularly ineffective year it.  come stick ass Karen. Nobody asked buy one liked looked seen one on. heart goes people suffering this. 2015 repeated near fatal bouts brain swelling caused liver failure. miracle survived, catastrophic brain injury - weeks meds raise blood pressure, lose fingers toes, let alone limbs.

The lasting damage memory issues, fatigue. meant return legal aid work doing. five years, pretty clear memory fatigue issues stay. fortunate retired young working liked to, to. 

I consulting work CEO large company. \`I lucky flexible time off. people mentioned article, become overtaxed, simplest things become overwhelming. start making mistakes. can't type. Often become intensely nauseated. 

I recently able start driving again. got sick pilot's license. driven mile home, learned early use GPS avoid becoming hopelessly lost. cannot turn radio, open window, etc. distraction mean trouble.

It took years help outstanding therapist works people learning live limitations peace new normal. wish anybody travel path best. rocky first; fact, quite while. wholeheartedly believe wearing masks, literally came Starbucks drive-through pulled mask window courtesy workers. problem wearing one requirements masks. 

When first started masking California stoked thought meant we’d way return normalcy...but it’s virtue signaling pissing contest masks *and* everything closed *and* you’re still encouraged stay home *and* you’d called grandma killer suggesting recreational activity *and* business (if one) still tanking... 

I’m incredibly skeptical 7+ month lockdowns, won’t lie there. Wow really Contagion That's thing... countries lockdowns went long enough complete enough. countries succeeded lockdown cases dropped 0. countries eliminate countries lifted lockdown still non-zero number.

We would eliminations countries thorough.  Yeah can't put microchips vapors able turn us mobile 5g towers triangulate island Elvis; that's big win. Probably. awwww, little baby authoritarian.... R 1.3 1.4 even winter yet.

There christmas markets. Note Sweden appears trending lower compared previous average Coronavirus hit. weeks large excess death spike, appear returned baseline. leads theory got fear COVID put took preventive measures. I’ve read times cases lagging indicators hospitalization even longer that. well teaching English PRC. I'm ethnically Chinese, sought after, anyway. mine opinions bs default supporting opposite view  Everyone wants answers.

The PRC wants hide for...reasons. early days it. UN estimates average around 9 million people die yearly starvation alone. means even entire world caught COVID, 2 3 years starvation deaths would top maximum death number COVID could ever cause. Assuming average applied consistently last decade, would mean somewhere around 90 million deaths average occurred last 10 years due starvation. 

Long-term effects starvation include myriad developmental issues affect person throughout entire life, limited growth-related diseases severe cognitive deficits caused malnutrition. 

Where mass concerns deaths caused starvation undeveloped nations last 100 years? Oh, that's right - people developed nations give shit outside virtue signaling knew effect personally. something cause us harm (0.02% us anyway), people citing potential worldwide deaths developed nations ever gave flying shit rest world - history shown case. Hey least got holidays beaches August. Good them. One last hurrah total collapse. reason think people access vaccine April, let alone one sufficiently effective go back normal. Idk several friends grill out, eat favorite restaraunt, play rec hockey every weekend. wearing mask grocery store, life pretty normal. First off, good science means explore many possibilities possible.

The second article non-peer-reviewed source.

As third one, cases Wuhan backdated Mid-November 2019.

The fourth one based x-rays definitive proof covid.

The last one is, again, month first cases Wuhan. I’m trying figure they’ll install chip nose...will go directly brain!?!? strongly disagree. Yes, bad people die flu. frankly concerning people willing undergo lockdown/mask way life even relatively minor diseases. anyone else want go concert again? hug someone? went path eliminating influenza would sacrificing much life is, big scheme things, marginal improvement (and maybe).

&amp;#x200B;

And that's beside point there's telling eradicating seasonal flu might bodies. thing saves us highly lethal flu strain point cross immunity prior strains influenza common rhinovirus? know simple ""less virus = always good."" getting harder harder course.      
         
There's supposed one ""brigade sanitaire"" administrative departments.   
For whole France, [9000 September, 2000 persons recruited. they? know.
                         
In [this september 20, one person working brigade said usually called 20-30 persons sometimes 73 persons day.
More people tests, people called, people tested... [It increases there's miss. least 2 persons positive never contacted [their (paywall, sorry). Opps, think let idiot out. That's pretty ignorant selfish thing say. Everyone else stay home play game. Nice. Coming place near soon. Lay crack! I'm boat you, hope put harsher measures place soon read actual study, even used correctly talking 16% reduction risk infection wear one properly every day 30 days.

Did see section article stating research completed 5 years ago applying washing concept coronavirus? pulling 16% research? match I've seen, I'm eager look data.  200,000 lives changed forever?  think speaking for? lol Sorry comment, know irresponsible part. someone suffers OCD result very, careful every area life avoid contracting virus. However, I'm US visiting husband weeks quickly used public water fountain yesterday park. water pressure low, let run seconds, put mouth near stream sucked without letting mouth touch faucet.

However, I'm course scared contracted something interaction. anxiety consuming despite fact seems unlikely - mouth touch faucet, nobody around there, surface contact unlikely way catching it. went today get free test safe general told seemed unlikely, unless near someone confirmed breathing vicinity.

However, still worry. worry justified? understand wait, someone OCD often waste time blowing things proportion. types resources experience would help realistically analyze situation would greatly appreciated. fell scam? Trump should’ve done better job convincing people wear masks it’s late. I'm getting vaccine covid, I'm anti vax crazy conservative person. trust vaccine put administration especially fast tracking it. reason vaccines take years create declared safe. I'm pregnant I'm risking putting anything body could harm good. need putting resources accurate testing antibodies, way know actually already immunity. Yup. upon time, worked preschool/daycare. first year working particular center, developed pneumonia 4 times one year. Lung infections SUCK. know I've terrible luck health area life (not nearly bad lots people, 3 close friends lupus, suffering nearly bad), mean life (or friends even worse health issues) worth less. I'm going risk even WORSE quality life fucking economy. ""Had"" half EU still lockdown. Learn live kids. 1918 hard too. French known rioting burning cars they're pissed off, probably right. Wow. Every single thing wrote completely false. Well done, genius. liberals: Follow science! 
WHO: lockdowns harm good, solid data showing masks really help either. oh mortality rate .6%(average age death 82) sorry scaring everyone 
liberals: SCIENCE Wonder contracted virus. stay home. can't speak absolutely worth book. several. fun, four letter word. Everyone's getting shit end stick. Us young people get constantly harangued stay inside stop socializing kill grandma, grandma typically already lived full rich life, come terms fact much time left earth anyway. Seems like old politicians ones scared, cling power even start losing mental faculties. french one military checked papers went buy groceries? France stuck plan

How long think worth live like that? negative undertone good news? Pretty sure every country one. Finland one well. People tend gather around like minded people. Even look,it's actual pain. course, lockdown society stop spreading immediately it’s momentarily. bet see country going second general lockdown net effect negative. 

Maybe don’t understand lot people dying lockdowns. Whenever decide drastic intervention must consider total effect number covid deaths given time point. extended period. I’m introvert also huge nerd. miss sci-fi/ comic conventions much right times feel “with people”. First nearby con happens receive vaccination going without hesitation. top 0.1% made awesome profits, that's counts. minority. “škodoradost” yeah, I’m neighbouring country let tell literally didn’t give single fuck pandemic summer. masks indoors, public transport, open borders, covid tests coming back covid infected country, big raves concerts, people sharing hard liquor... still think like month CZ much better now, first serious restrictions passed like 2 weeks ago takes time slow whole thing down... family members adhere knowing risks okay whole ""dont get grandma sick"" argument goes window. one saying though. know frame protecting apparently significant portion world psychopathic care I’m saying scientific study waste money. area known heavily vote opposition party. actually tried get non “urgent” care recently? surgeries postponed? ic admittance low. Every single one takes way lot regular care. military already trained hospitals saying can’t already handle it, doubt someone nothing right draw line “low” is. opinion showing Political direction discredit honesty.

Maybe misread this? took believed incorrect consider political direction. so, apologies. agree, headline seemed sensational cherry picked. You’re combining necessary lockdown primary technique Vaarwel! Maybe effective risk take different vaccine works better trying immunize populace get herd immunity going anything 50% good?  realize healthcare industry part economy right? puzzling thing this, people seem think hospitals effected economic collapse. elective surgeries, people aren’t getting regular screenings, virtual appointments. Doctors nurses getting laid due well. elected boss? tired motherfuckers wasting resources putting healthcare workers risk Actually, assumed time. Contact tracing also shown small fraction infected individuals responsible large fraction new infections.

Publicizing fact harm good. Speak bought one case. Yup Masks, I’m supporter of. They’re effective low cost. 

Lockdowns, fan. Costs high justify. Whether agree (I think do), pretty easy read petition see they're saying. want elderly preexisting conditions stay home- government help them- rest community thing. used hate needles. highschool got bit dog. Lady stick around get info, precaution get rabies shots. One arm, one wound (on ankle) one butt. 1 shot every weeks believe two months. fear needles. get needle opened wound, regular shot piece cake. Damn straight! know, close neighbor can't help compare death toll 210K. Social distancing, wear masks grocery stores, post office etc. Protect elderly. 

Laws guarantee paid PTO workers. Free medical treatment covid suspected covid. Public service announcement informing public covid suspected covid treatment free. virus falls apart day fresh food eating contaminated food lead infection digestive system hits stomach acid right kinds cells virus latch to. Heating food kills it, too. US lock down. parts US called unenforced restrictions loopholes ""lockdowns"". could argue half-assing lockdowns harm good make case whole-ass lockdowns. 

There's narrative going round curve flattened, supposed stay flat proves lockdowns purpose, incredibly specious. Nobody wants lockdown idea one would necessary based hope evidence reason. start seeing exponential growth better lockdown hospitals become overwhelmed. healthcare workers overwhelmed point compromising safety protocol. Injected vaccines going cause issue supply chain needles syringes. simply aren’t enough administer required doses US around world. vaccines require two injections, doubling required US Covid task force projected needing least 850 million syringes needles inoculation population. 

Just another piece bad news 2020. well 20 years Exp professional good paid freelancer top 500 companies enough sub. Ob well downvote fun. ridiciouls failure needs 2 3 hours cleanup including data checks. system designed correctly eg expect wrong data delivered. understand built like that, it’s convenience it’s throwing completely. Temporary measures. honestly things already horribly bad. many people need get permanently damaged die it’s worth taking seriously? Perfect excuse ""forgetting"" wear masks. I’m stating facts. aren’t actually sure Asian countries didn’t huge surges- there’s strong data pre-existing immunities I’m sure culture mask-wearing helped lot. forced government lockdowns (Vietnam 75,000 one point)- easier government totalitarian. 

So don’t think there’s serious downsides ongoing rolling lockdowns? people want vaccine able get one later April things back normal. vacinated still wear mask respect others, going back gym, visiting friends, etc 

There still might 1/3 country still remains locked down, me. Lol. I’m That’s completely wrong. Previously-healthy people died suffered long term sequelae virus. fact *majority* “long haul” patients *mild* disease courses. I’ve already returned normal life. Gym three four times week. Working ton. Backpacking biking time. I’m seeing friends frequently pandemic even. Lots football parties Yeah save weeks additional life 95+ year olds. even get tested you’re presymptomatic you’re unlikely test positive there’s winning besides masks social distancing me, I’ve social distancing avoiding indoor gatherings since March I’m willing continue maximum, next fall. don’t go beyond that. I’m fairly extroverted person psychological toll simply much.

I'm fairly introverted person found taking toll first months. I'm introvert, hermit. relative much extraverted difficult her. keep keeping best can. secret is

1) lot news sources

2) learn bias, check sources

3) Hate Perfect example positive effect corona get horizontal doesn’t happen. Next time, let nurse doctor know suffer syncope (pronounced ‘sin-co-pee’) needles involved ask let lie flat surface sit chair fully reclines. Almost blood draw injection type facilities measures place days people go faint and/or pass out. Lying flat usually helps prevent fainting help bring someone fainted back consciousness many cases.
(I suffer vasovagal syncope time get hole poked me.) legend plain text rather color coded. Say what? Shockedpikachu.jpg website largest banner ads I've ever seen.  Y’all need back NPR better. infinitely better public broadcasting Canada.

Edit “public” think missing point article, really expose' horrible home placed in. But, also, positive test would shift course treatment. That's President Chris Christie still much alive well; infection treated confirmed positive test. doubt widespread. people end lives terribly ill sometimes doctors probably assess whether humane admit ICU. doctor told ICU admission traumatic sometimes people frail survive it.

Just told. Yes... *but*, lot healthy people also getting leveled virus. would mistake treat like exasperating factor rather debilitating pathogen. could close death even feeling perfectly fine? Something would worried ""inhaling it"" wrong somehow working. least shot know inside you. needed form migrant caravan motivate part electorate. lockdown/masks controversy helped fill role cycle. don’t understand lockdowns summer. 

If look numbers it’s clear virus less deadly warmer months. could immune systems stronger summer could warmer weather weakens strength covid. 

Either way lockdowns summer. 

I worry winter going another story. may see deadly covid.  I'm sure ...but type people want associated with. state mess....beautiful, mess. reply another comment 
The virus falls apart within day food, paper, clothes. Personally, clean packaging rubbing alcohol transfer produce different plastic bags go fridge. Anything I'm using day go fridge, bother cleaning let sit bag couple days.

A months ago, Washington Post interviewed number epidemiologists/virologists, think 6 8 them, included Fauci. None said sanitize groceries cause big infection point, felt they'd seeing way cases faster spread. theres things. 

1) get early. 

2) semi relevant.

3) short sweet.

4) watch updoots roll in. Goodbye old normal. thing pretty sweet chance I'm going spend 80 dollars mask. honest, would never wear something like public. know that's silly haha Mate chatting shit deterrence, can't say ""just sick ones wear mask"" impossible even tracing power world. everybody uses mask even sick ones wear it. goes nukes works 100x better really elephant room nobody seems want talk about. That’s great NZ eliminated virus, virus become endemic everywhere else. Even vaccine, it’s going eradicated. vaccine strains flu, yet still comes around. exit strategy NZ, order keep virus out, keep borders shut, basically forever. mess really don’t think history going look kindly lockdown strategy. Fair enough, guess thinking worst hit states overall. go numbers New York Louisiana worst off. Huh, got old fashioned needle. Honestly care long works. US tests per capita France. Stop lying. Northern England pretty much going lockdown tomorrow. Personally think winged hoping could hold October half term. can't people dead. Incompetence again. Sweden doesn’t underreport weekends. don’t report weekends. 

Have look 7 day average, see numbers. don’t wait two weeks that. last reporting day. good Death Metal Florida I'm disturbed terrible job we've done teaching people safe. 

The public seem understand mask wearing properly.  [recent church state church pretty obviously trying follow guidelines thought mask wearing necessary moving around allowed participants take masks indoors long periods time talked sang. 

They explained statement efforts, including sanitizing eliminate contact transmission, negligible risk comparison singing indoors mask. lack care caused outbreak, lack clear messaging. airwaves full misinformation, spin straight lies, important messages stay safe getting drowned out. Contact tracing nothing activity. 

If contact trace 50% cases, also helps bring R.

Anyway, agree control. Wolfe proactive. Half citizens state hate it. many self entitled selfish Americans. rotten egg it. think might “frame” piece around Covid would whole story  Wtf false anti mask bullshit talk Lmaooooo Florida highest daily 200 something NY 1k. Stay inside forever man it’s safe 🤣 masks social distancing, lessen viral load, nothing severity infection, seems depend on...the viral load?  thanks! CT's model fair tradeoff. That's basically rounding error. average age death Covid 19 North 70 years. American Life expectancy 76. possible entire state 16 intensive care beds... seem almost criminally negligent? That's fargin insane. Died ambulance arrived? covid kill quickly really bad shape before?
May rest peace That’s disgusting matter what. people think ok? Trump can’t fire apparently. Actually, Fauci proved he's good making logical fallacies sound scientific.

By logic, could say since everyone take large dose vitamin C right event, proves vitamin C prevents spread virus. know too! Glad page holding consistent standard elected leaders! also publicly mused people wearing masks make feel bad. man fucking narcissistic moron. Nice, shall cohersed sharing scandalous photos interweb. also reality probably take something like 3 months (December large portion Wuhan maybe end February) see, mistake. I'm driving North Dakota.
I decided camp tonight bismark tomorrow afternoon.

I went one store half people wearing masks.

Fun times soon Trump quits dictating science science say, fully trust CDC again. compromised self-serving demands. Cute think ""pandemic parenting"" happening along. could make statement really fucking stupid comparing current situation. Like, they're even close thing. I'm honestly surprised tried route. 

Again, I'm sorry statistics make sad. handle feelings making ridiculous comparisons greatest look. saying... appeared TV cough, climbed 2 flights stairs breath (surprise!), BFF got 480m $ contract said got covid 'miracle' cure got better instantly. Totally believable. it’s extremely unrealistic keep living like almost another 2 years Trump supporting republicans this. sane Americans wearing masks I’m proud them. can’t wait Biden take charge situation. trump fault, state governors whether democrat republican shit. could close without approval trump federal government. also peoples fault going restaurants, bars stuff pretending world back normal. Masks helps 100%, thought full poof 100% anti virus shield

People need stay home. Also treated respiratory disease, since know better. find bizarre often say infections aren’t high deaths low need masks. say implement things get worse. hell wait things get worse?? It’s craziness definitely right assumptions you. Thank finally giving good encounter discussing things. appeared TV cough, climbed 2 flights stairs breath (surprise!), BFF got 480m $ contract said got covid 'miracle' cure got better instantly. Totally believable. Bread circus.

Trump hoping use stimulus payments achieve similar gains. ironically, Republicans created culture war prevent succeeding -- people disdain Trump going switch loyalties money. spring old sick get test, it’s like practically anyone get test regardless age symptoms. look positivity rate. NY State, conducted ~20,000 tests spring positivity rate 50-60%, throughout summer, conducted around 100,000 tests day like 1% positivity rate. models true peak infections Europe US early spring 10x amount recorded cases, minimum, peak occurred weeks recorded peak occurred.

Lots people missed, it’s evident antibody studies well. still missing infections today, bad back then. smash mouth mosh pit smh many people think include though?  Yeah, realization lot people really suck disheartening. Like I'm sure theyve told masks protecting people protecting give shit. 

Just remember, end getting covid stupidity 95% likelihood asymptomatic don't. short memories go pub enjoy last evening probably last warhamemr game next month so

It's also best chance get Covid. 

I would bet 1% population currently infectious - Covid, infect get near them.

Going right lockdown want party instead taking precautions numbers rise dumbest fucking thing do. 
It's also reason need lockdown. arithmetic - /u/bobbies23 correct.  “But banned travel China” I’m getting sick heat lame shitty “defense” means anything funny people call ""a woman"" ""gay"" wearing mask. insulting, way maintaining health? gotta make election. It'll end election. \s ominous there's still bigger milestone achieve Definitely not, stop bullshit. social democratic lot favour capitalism. completely ‘team mask’ even wear multiple layers. However event isn’t scientific experiment proves nothing. read find mention people wearing masks didn’t become sick, like Starbucks Seoul, Korea. Instead said event zero masks. punish America global warming really isn't. Plus ton people never Disney before. podium today fielding angry guests without reservation. mk handful spots LTT Sunday Monday. it. freaking holiday weekend!! know quick service extended waits food well. 

The whole damn weekend mess. can't tell many people complained park crowded. One woman actually complaining ""felt unsafe"". Stay hell home then. get need guests keep jobs. 

It sucks really PT layoffs (I hung bunch party last night) people displaced moving higher seniority people heart breaking. people worked years gone. never going same. dealing this, walk job giant fucking cloud deal guest shit much. drag tunnel everyday. 

Then get berated guests policies zero control over. want tell Karen put mask 3 times less 10 minutes (fucking actually happened, last time spoke nice said would calling security next). want listen crazy lady north jersey telling covid Florida. want smile, take table make small talk. difference countries seem care told, wear masks greater proportion us everything possible spread quickly possible within ranks. least ones taken Murdoch media elsewhere. would be, headlines long, periods. repeat half people average intelligence taken next level. even depressed correct.... Minnesota trying hold back flood gates. metro area well, counties next North South Dakota current outbreaks happening. Lockdowns collapse economy. Ugh get new talking points like 12 weeks old Ah yes, ""Forget Republicans Legalizing Abortion"" channel  Unfortunately can’t fix stupid. Yep.

But genie bottle right selfcentered fools want adjust lives all.

Now fucked years.

Hell, even third world monarchies like Thailand able pull getting hit all. living normal lives without restrictions every way save fact tourists, supply chain issues everyone facing. anti maskers gaining followers Canada too, disappointing don’t know it.  New York's governor basically getting flak. Convo Americans pulled together sacrificed ww2...we would never stuff now. society we’re selfish entitled. 

I mean didn’t manufacture new cars several
Years. People saved donated bacon grease. Teens volunteered school Red Cross en masse. literally 100 counties ICU facilities all. medivac surrounding states getting crushed? study show effectiveness masks all. that's editorializing headline writer. shows opening bars &amp; restaurants cause spike cases, closing got rid it.

There's way could tease separate effect masks data had.

[Figure 7 research gives away. 

Masks probably help, study way proves it.  Imma need sexy mask pics, happen.

😷😷😷  rallying cry is, ""I live fear!""

Which ironic, since people saying ""I live fear"" ones can't stop talking they're going shoot someone breaks house. wearing mask political thing, see one political group impacted one no?
I believe people get covid talking long minutes someone. home family member friend. Sometimes bar that's allowed.
In comparison, Refusing wear mask beach supermarket probably big source infection, especially 99% wearing think gonna announce Tuesday? point 13 people disagree study show effectiveness masks all. that's editorializing headline writer. shows opening bars &amp; restaurants cause spike cases, closing got rid it.

There's way could tease separate effect masks data had.

[Figure 7 research gives away. 

Masks probably help, study way proves it. Username checks Politics complex 1-dimensional left-right scale even begin describe it. really wish could case see anti-masker population pushing harder harder mask use time goes on. I've always admired different Asian countries/cultures considerate others' health like that. possibilities. may gotten dumps past see cases reported organizations sent updates. case may identifiers. Data people messy since people don’t unique identifiers, things like names often spelled entered different ways. Pretty much everyone NYC survived 9/11 comparable statement could make someone speaks event. China enters chat Yes, pooled testing current infections something accomplish logistically benefit compared antibody tests whole population. {sigh}

she tell personally, rest assured actually opposed right, I'm living fear dman everything avoid it! Hello! I'm nurse honestly years nursing (only nursing 4 years far still learning) never experienced much stress burn life. thought bad working child abuse cases IPV new grad seeing people struggle breathe Covid19 gramdmum die stressful.

 found pilates yoga helped mind pandemic. even went bought sewing machine help fight distress. Big respects nurses fighting pandemic too. Stay safe everyone. fear you’re right. Unfortunately even much freedom turns problem today’s world. People worried expressing don’t wear mask it’s right to, seeing bigger picture. Forget 2021 2022 basically repeat 2020. **nothing**. Got it. fail life. 

Hope sentences short enough someone limited intellectual capacity. truly wish worst family. whole thread purely political dumbass. Bad bot. absolutely right. everyone gone NZ route February/March *none* would happened. 2 month complete lockdown would inflicted far less economic damage well. Nah aren't, government insisting students workers turn up, even to. Yeah couple months ago got told Sep /Oct... January *might* optimistic extra care mean nice dose *remdesivir* know many hundreds pages HIPAA (statute &amp; regs) runs to?

I'm guessing don't.

its provisions regarding discretion doctors -- &amp; patients -- regarding release info run dozens, alone. 

But forget &amp; wise up, Matlock -- info withheld statutory bar. That's people oppose conveniently dying Wow !!! Hell remind indeed. understand it’s preprint, emergency like pandemic need keep ahead curve look terms substance structure rather black white “is preprint peer-reviewed”. isn’t observational study done simple commercial antibody tests, thorough antibodies cellular response. substance structure findings, respected source EU (that mind privately funded exercised bidding private backer). Say want, applying logic helped get side Dexamethasone Vitamin deficiency/Calcifediol treatment well advance. Currently I’ve really starting back ivermectin/doxycycline quick, early stage treatment prevent hospitalization Phase 3 preprints basis. 

Not everyone believe ask source claims provided basis beliefs, far logic I’ve using preprints hasn’t failed me. Doesn’t mean I’m gonna right 100% time (honestly could lucky streak could start getting things wrong) right don’t see fundamental flaws structure study. So..anyone born *after* 1980 millennial?? thought 90 🤔 think can't ""see"" enemy. ironic part mostly affecting people can't ""see"" god yet claims exists. Hey,

The scientific process coming conclusion immediately definitive. Back then, knew, Masks inefficient means controlling spread. learnt more, scientific community realised wrong important masks control spread virus. 

People learn evolve. hope move embrace need wearing mask defeat pandemic.  Goodness linking garbage website? scientific complete nonsense. Please link reputable scientific journals, anti-science junk. sincerely hope “It’s optics, safety” becomes mainstreamed way describing GOP rona formal discussions Puppies tough! Would KN95 mask effective surgical cloth mask? particular brand sells good ones? scientific process coming conclusion immediately. Back then, knew, Masks inefficient means controlling spread. learnt more, scientific community realised wrong important masks control spread virus. 

People learn evolve. Imagine even *capable* understanding everyone thinks way do.

You owe life countless folks - soldiers, EMTs, scientists - made immense personal sacrifices good people they'd never meet.

But hey, least honest underlies right-wing thought. know US last much longer. We're past point return. want get Mr.Bones Wild Ride! got mine today happening countries well degree US Co-signed. Yes. Hospitals empty. know fact haven’t u think cough kill you. U know nothing tv tells that’s problem. go see hospitals. Meanwhile got downvoted shit earlier today Gen-z pricks pointing death isn’t negative outcome here. come back life general dangerous. fucking hate people. already addressed misinformation comment. first cases China even linked market. still investigating cause. China even suspect regard anymore history proven time time first place pandemic identified necessarily means then, maryland, population 6 million people, 130,000 confirmed cases, actually 650k 1 million real cases? 20 times higher, suggest extreme end things, something like 2.6 million already covid?

yeah, way. freaking way. would mean 1 20 cases symptomatic. believe second.

sometimes need take theoretical test real numbers, judge world around you. there's simply way almost half population maryland covid already. OP, anyone born 80 (some say 82, earliest I've seen 80) Gen X. So, 40ish, would Gen x. Got Italian British passports, moved US. Let's see :) Yah nice wish coach ain’t gonna happen

UF President Fuchs gonna hard pass believe would happened President 2000. believe that’s great divide began happening. Dunno s/he considers himself, s/he falls solidly time span Gen X Yeah, I’ve struck smooth criminal kind ironic Trump administration/far right trying play virus say “it’s cool guys, everything going fine we’ll get back Chy-na” reality likely cost votes anything. undecided voters likely level headed far right/left able piece together everything going Really hope they'll look overall picture nationwide lockdown instead piecemeal region region lockdown. Masks protect people virus protect them. know spreads airborne particles, basically breathing talking. masks reduce this.

I surprised someone wearing mask sick could still spread mask wearers. really people would wear damn masks could stop debating minutiae it. Wearing mask protect people around you. falls apart people protecting well. going take lot deprogram cult. going take even kill idea. I'm tinfoil conspiracy theorist, there's way hell populated country world domestic transmitted cases. actually said:

“I think — data speak themselves,” nation’s top infectious disease expert said during [an interview with CBS “We super-spreader event White House, situation people crowded together wearing masks. data speak themselves.” I'm early 40s always considered 80s kid. 90s teen.

In response FYI: accurate!  don’t get people loathe it. It’s really hard it’s really something that’s uncomfortable. Republican Party even 30 years ago nothing like party today. yah no. Mullen getting denied one went community college almost 4 years starting remedial classes get chance transfer real university. half semesters spent home alone, learning anything stupid zoom classes. Hell likely even get graduation ceremony. depresses literally every day. information still unknown ongoing immunity. Even Dr. Fauci said vaccine isn’t enough expect flu vaccine (similar)coverage 50-70 percent. 70 optimal. Holy shit. think figured out. bet backwards hat equivalence wearing mask nose. Vaccine effectively trains immune system produce antibodies virus. think different body survived live virus produce antibodies? sounds awesome!

Seeing sarcasm come son’s mouth year amazing. lol B52 bomber days useless bombing afghan tribesmen. Missiles it’s at. Nuclear Bombers nations detectable anti air systems S400 get within target range. yes. China bombers Russia US. It’s old technology. Yes, antibiotics. 1918 said May holiday nothing major happened. Guess wasn’t moronic think second wave way.

Kinda (proverbial) icing cake White House became super spreading clusterfuck.

Anyway, that’s 30 days later. entire article doesn’t anything proof masks work, title mentioned here. I’m single dad almost 16 year old. great time hanging him. He’s taught play Warzone love watching play online friends. actually get joking around playing. adaptive immune system behind endothelial shredding seen CoV 2, Spanish Flu. thing would expect highly pathogenic virus. anything outrageously unexpected inexplicable. Lol that? read article link OP? literally trash - headline substance article back up. Yeah, good look someone trying voice science. Yikes. next virus deadlier, screwed. fucking ridiculous. trump said wear mask day 1. We'd saved many people businesses. We'd probably control point people could relax little. education knowledge there. difficult cutting bullshit people *prefer* consume. active ignorance. people 99.9% chance survive initial thought Russia’s internet research agency folks see chance Trump loses hedge bets next “fuck America plan” maximize COVID impact 2nd wave winter Facebook anti mask groups. 

Hell could adding regardless Trumps chances. 

Like said facts back wouldn’t surprise comes true. Good them. Genuinely. means this: Readers therefore aware articles bioRxiv finalized authors, might contain errors, report information yet accepted endorsed way scientific medical community.

Abstract
Abstract Background Convalescent plasma, widely utilized viral infections induce neutralizing antibodies, proposed COVID-19, preliminary evidence shows might beneficial effect. objective compare epidemiological characteristics outcomes patients received convalescent plasma COVID-19 not, admitted hospitals Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, throughout pandemic. Methods multicenter, retrospective cohort study 2-month duration beginning June 1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients diagnosed COVID-19, admitted 215 hospitals pneumonia. Epidemiological clinical variables registered Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma supplied part centralized, expanded access program. Results analyzed 3,529 patients pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 62±17, arterial hypertension diabetes main comorbidities; 51.4% admitted ward, 27.1% Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 21.7% ICU mechanical ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality 34.9%; 26.3%, 30.1% 61.4% ward, ICU ICU-MV patients. **Convalescent plasma administered 868 patients (24.6%); 28-day mortality significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%, p&lt;0.001).** major adverse effects occurred. Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission without MV requirement, diabetes preexistent cardiovascular disease independent predictors 28-day mortality, whereas convalescent plasma administration acted protective factor. Conclusions study suggests administration convalescent plasma CO Tons extra money way less retirees pay covid cases rising. They'll rich need standard mask policy Netherlands. wear it. went Florida last Christmas (from Ontario) came back stepdad said worst flu he's ever everyone else got sick. Somehow, despite car 24 hours house next two days, missed getting sick returned college. returned January 4th. Well, long rate. realize that’s pre print right? hope dropped ""/s"" 

Intolerable strong word use convey full meaning. Oooof. faced “like man, boy”.

That's awesome haha  Lemmings vaccine different getting virus hoping immune system picks next time. Dosing, booster frequency, strains, fact didn’t get sick controlled vaccine. nearly smart think are.  either get covid going full Wuhan drag live hell we're Masks used said dangerous offered false sense protection (and right). Soon became clear protection better nothing (as many claiming since begging pandemic). institutions claimed dangerous completely changed minds right wing movements started questioning mask usage never accepted offer little helpful protection (since can’t sold public) started sell cheap homemade masks best tool deal pandemic. Yes, mask usage politicized, doesn’t help come sides Fyi. first cases China even linked Korea tracks origin cases see countries responsible majority spread. Hint: ain't china dozen exported cases South  Nah. People get stuffy nose get tested. mostly people sick enough require medical care.  ""This means China large number COVID-19 cases next 14 days, completely free effects epidemic""

14 days counting Queens today half people saw street wearing masks. wonder numbers starting go up. People...sigh. that's goal, reopen level keeps hospitals overwhelmed? current lockdowns purpose anyone explain. virus never going away. Unless we're going wear masks social distance forever, what's point? people risk coronavirus also likely [benefit vaccine, works all. technocrats already damage control saying vaccine less effective masks, get ready wear another year. point that? different year? bullshit. need look definition antisocial. much would rest planet benefit happen? Probably lot! fun fight wars using guns bombs. doctor said 239 pounds 🙄  I've saying. trust everyone take personal responsibility, throw criminal code? even need government for?  Hubby 3 surgery kept getting scheduled...he happy swab half inch nostril lol  want got!

Available everyone free! talking leadership history political? Fuck 8 million infected 
328 million population 

320 million left go! Sorry, MedCram regurgitated? physician?

Do know mechanism Spanish Flu killed 1918? labs work back then? Dr Doolittle, Dr Jeckyl, Dr Doom Doc Martin agree Dr Quack. That's nuts. San Francisco we've 123 deaths total ever. people freaking fuck three classrooms worth people dying every day. USA NUMBER ONE! wear mask outside home, except car go somewhere, short walk car street empty.

At home? No, though cold symptoms pandemic? Yes, would isolate wear one.

Right now, except one store TJ (which enforces mask wearing) shopping trip every six weeks so, go stores anyplace inside people. Contractkess pick anything version Amazon Instacsrt, mostly amazon cause instacart charges fees.

I used local shopping st start, many dick noses small children without masks even stores try enforce.

Last trip TJ, one child 2 without mask. it. mom kid cart trying social distance instead letting child run rampant.

For me? pneumonia, twice, damaged lungs, so, masks avoiding care others choice.

But used shop locally, used takeout, used care survival local businesses. anymore - life worth enforcing wearing mask, going way spend money worth it.

By amount closing businesses open? alone. Manitoban here. well think. We're fucking PISSED numbers.

We nearly leading country suppressing virus spring, totals low hundreds deaths single digits.

But we've breaking records new cases, active cases deaths past days weeks. trail Quebec active cases per capita fucking useless jackass premier hard-on opening take days respond things need addressed hours anything effective. seem sure. Perhaps would like examine [this 8000+ subject study Belgium shows substantial benefits. difference people used correct dose. Simple really. rest world listen.

Funny mention that, SK actually wanted COVID model worldwide standard. Asian countries successfully implemented similar systems, Singapore one. want pretend everything hunky dory public close noticing order actually ride out, needed feds spend ton money subsidizing people’s livelihoods, necessitating progressive tax overhaul. much leap realizing there’s perfectly good alternatives grinding death, living work going broke paying health care wealth flow upward. Instead got may stupidest battle culture war date, regressive tax cut, $1200.  Show us 2 negative Trump Covid tests 2 consecutive days then. career okay right now, started new job August way network build relationships coworkers, hurt long run. 

My love life horrible. can't stop thinking decent exes, rejected favor alcohol (one) lot anxiety much people pleaser fear rejection (the other, ironic).  Domestic time, hospital associtated, city last batch infected port workers. New lockdowns blanket tests underway. Man, good time anti-american. 
 
Americanophobe?Just xenophobic?Whatever, point is, hate guys deserve this. Time debate! take genius understand covering face help virus enters face Bolsanaro fascist. eradication become goal? Many experts said expect around awhile pandemic levels. Measles still around huge threat Duh Never go full wuhan study show HQC effective. [This study]( done Belgium, showed significant benefits. [This video]( provides detailed discussion matter. really comes using correct dose. mean call edge looks like facts even Americans. Christians dumbasses Europe post removed because:

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* opinion, virus modified lab. Sorry Chris Christie Hitler, far honest many additional people dead massive anti-mask culture. 

And 3rd party voters throw votes trash, voted. democracy vote candidate like. Maybe instead voter shaming 70% population ( non-voters, 3rd party trump voters), candidate runs want need country. Dems entitled 3rd party votes cant wait listen left wings cry 4 years K, cept they're still bad US, even use good example behave. quite well there, sad hear opened quickly. EU bought lot time. 150 deaths day months medical treatments much better. However new wave clearly going bad - France alone certainly going surpass death rate soon case rate worse US sunbelt surge.

They could much worse much faster without masks restrictions. 

The likes South Korea still strong case study - rigour compliance obviously higher west, never went full lockdown. Hospital capacity even question there. serious one EU. everybody going die eventually. 

I guess murder legal. article say they're marrying, one notes mentions see marriage still mean death Save Children predicts many 10 million children might never return school pandemic, girls. children miss attending school, could also miss receiving life-saving comprehensive sex education, putting girls risk high-risk adolescent pregnancies.

That’s judgement someone’s reaction people struggling

Think they’re sitting philosophizing (is word?) world turned upside down? Again? Wtf happened?    Austrian politicians dragging feet elections. kindergarten cluster spread nursing home. good situation. 

That ghoul Faßmann (Education minister) said May/June, ""Children spread virus."" Instead paying attention Israel's summer outbreak, fueled students, stuck false assertion. Schools Austria chaotic, many small clusters, teachers told quarantine exposure virus, since shortage teachers. many gaffes here, Faßmann's worst opinion. know sleeps night. financial interest company * prints trillions dollars keep people away other, kicks car manufacturing ventilator manufacturing gear, fast-tracks vaccine development, rushes approval new treatments, etc.

(choose one) People allowed praise China? feel much freedom suddenly. find super hard believe know 1) source data, 2) date sent duplicate, 3) total number records sent, would take significant amount time clean database.

I mean, three separate sorting/filtering criteria. like test results hand written, right?

That is, unless portion 400,000 results *weren't* actually previously reported. mixture would harder sift out, that's they're claiming. part jobs get paid well 200k/yr, hell expect? take risks every fucking day go work errands. can’t control behavior people I’m comfortable know people partying bars frat parties. People still fun see people would nice considerate us likely die adjusted things stop spread. read? NIH compilation review RCTs, FFS. clearly bothered read it. 

Im done thread right around christmas. visiting parents mom week came visit. Right start 16 hour drive home emptying entire body 48 hours straight. got bad one point took shower 2 (you get it) blacked shower. Fell, hit head hard enough get concussion. managed get knew bathroom door locked didnt want team fire fighters breaking find asleep naked shower god knows what, god knows where. could see straight stopped puking every hour started drive home soon felt congestion chest. get bad bronchitis almost every year lasts months makes feel exactly like everyone describes covid like. brushed off. surprise 2 weeks later back new moved on. 

A ton people going get covid. know. dont assume sickness covid, flu season. worldwide, America. India worst now. Herkenbaar, ik wist het ook niet totdat ik dit las! tell old people go club, job done Yikes. one highest per capita daily new cases I’ve ever seen populated country like France  hope kills ya good insurance. I'm longer front lines I've heard brutal right now, I'm sure would burnt million times now. hope getting good self care despite pandemic. Thank work well.

And worth, visual imagery give deniers better feel free keep sharing. agree people aren’t going stop. liken HIV epidemic, it’s better teach safer ways things abstinence, people won’t fully stop hide practices feel ashamed. masks make event safer, try get public wear masks rather shame going. can. Selfishness American way. extracted Adrenochrome pizza parlor basements Started winter China. went Florida Keys back December week got back, got extremely sick couldn’t get bed two days extremely sore couldn’t move far without getting fatigued drenched sweat. ended going work next day two hours sent home, ended taking two days afterwards. end week gotten entire aisle sick gotten family sick well. didn’t go doctor I’m sure virus. I’ve bad flu felt different. fatigue brain fog lingered weeks after, felt weird. heard woman interviewed BBC morning. matter facts presented with, she'll believe coronavirus hears Fox Trump (Apparently rest world conspiracy). Worse, since got virus (perhaps) recovered, assumes everyone else too. Honestly, sounded like gullible cult members. 

There people beyond help. long vote guy again. getting Pakistan thing from?

Read OP's link, statistics also depict India country maximum number people (around 56%) without toilets basic sanitation.

Again, half population 1 billion plus people? Ya right. Lol. France, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, reporting record amount daily cases.


Get head ass. authoritarian updates? two months old amusing came conclusion like see graph readable. among patients high viral levels antibodies eliminated 99% viral load.

Has peer reviewed double blind study shown quoting observational study? Thanks advance! yes, that's saying risk near people.

I agree, simply going near anyone, need mask. shit hospitalized. significant, although smaller, group people 80+ saying fuck it, years left anyway No, western democracies UK switzerland control. let planes land reason. country handle vary depending circumstances, I've talking US. 

You insulting making assumptions help case whatsoever. Around rallying cry is, ""I live fear!""

Edited add: think bs. Yep, work school too. brought coworkers mid January. closest urban place (requires air travel) work brought home supplies. Wuhan shut down. live island susceptible disruption supply chain anyway! Sure enough... guess happened! also told thought everything would closing sooner rather later. thought crazy! ""Adopting measures protect vulnerable central aim public health responses COVID-19. way example, nursing homes use staff acquired immunity perform frequent PCR testing staff visitors. Staff rotation minimized. Retired people living home groceries essentials delivered home. possible, meet family members outside rather inside. **A comprehensive detailed list measures, including approaches multi-generational households, implemented, well within scope capability public health professionals.**""

Yeah, soon hand waive away going 25% seniors living multigenerational homes 20% still work, I'm going assume plan Trump's plan protect people pre-existing conditions, assumed based upon information is: Let die ditch. Look 'christ church rapes moscow idaho's see everybody fucking hates them. false too. drug made embryonic stem cells. 

It tested cell line called HEK293T cells. derived single fetus 50 years ago continuous use since. Yes, burden proof people declaring certainty mask wearing outside makes difference. 

I saying know. one making definitive assertion. burden proof me. literate. Yes, rare precautions taking. 

I went rain used umbrella, stayed dry. rain get wet. never gather. gathers anymore? Learn China then. So... 'war polio' war, 'war smallpox' war, historical events required citizens work authority physicians scientists contain, control, eradicate diseases benefit Mankind? 

Yes, brainwashed. brainwashed thinking medicine science last, best hope uncaring universe kill us countless ways. brainwashed thinking humans survive working together common good all. brainwashed believing die like dogs, like cavemen darkness ignorance.

I brainwashed, unlike you, shining beacon ignorance, futility suffering all. 

You may worship death, absolutely not. Yeah lot preppers early hehe. much talk type food preparations

One interesting thing thought people wanted masks listen cdc nonsense working Great Barrington Declaration censored heavily subreddit r/COVID-19? Trust get that, one people, situation regardless pull weight continue spread kill people needlessly. Yes missed meeting people last 7 months, lost summer internship, I’m still paying full tuition pretty terrible online courses, haven’t seen family 8 months, conversations people video chat. upset this? course, I’m upset people taking seriously. takes us making effort effectively get this. despite country one worst outbreaks people really caring, still try best follow needed get this, sake everyone. quite possibly one dumbest replies I've seen while. agree pandemic likely go long lack leadership finally leadership divide driven mask wearing uphill battle relies vaccine, yeah probably going take long easily. I'm government creating new treatment facilities, creating new facilities letting virus run rampant like seemingly promoting. 

Stop thinking manichean binary way. nice evening. virus evolves remains mystery bad sequels get. best policy still catching it. Mask on, social distancing, it’s hard. sure scientists aren’t smart 3 people sample size. fact explain once.... makes brains hurt. people understand stuff? Better ""live fear"" live denial. 70k+ India. They’re catching USA. probably surpass us soon. might year, especially can't differentiate person Ok dr dump.  That’s good point. It’s difficult conversation can’t get everyone board Medicaid all. There’s money made building clinics Covid patients associated long term therapy might needed. 

Most aggressive anti-lockdown/maskers I’ve seen want everything go back normal without thought downsides beyond old people dying. Alright, I'll see stupid ass summer 2021/when still governments still built extra clinics actually save people. I’m 79 years old. getting plane. flights I’ve seated near people sneezing coughing, three days later, I’ve got it. So, chance. Metro, public transportation. I’m high risk group, don’t want play around.

Clearly Fauci believes so, due high risk group in, Trump. seems think survive got infection due fact. fly, use Metro public transportation, even though got infected he'd treat world's best medical facilities. Speaks volumes it? tend watch people do, say. neighbors much faster you. wasn’t taken seriously enough many excess deaths compared properly managed? Don’t get wrong, I’m 100% Trump administration handled COVID, many people would died even properly managed. I’m curious amount/ratio might be... 50K excess? 100K? 150K? irony people think fall category 'weak'. one Mumbai slums found 57% people antibodies. parts city lower, around 16%, general India sure way way infections reported - also rather young population due general conditions people weak immune systems much likely died early causes.

China yes well far 3 obese people surviving sample size ... 3 Removed misinformation. spread here. cite sources. people died falling sounds awful. shocking see many people lack sort empathy. hope friend pull :( hardest hit regions.

And new york city .28% entire population die virus already.

Again, number impossible even every single many, woman, child already infected (and haven't, course). Compare HK then, 45 min train ride mainland.

Or compare UK NZ. island countries. *laughing south korean* way Yah man used 4 accounts downvote -3 🙄

If can't understand basis HIV vaccine treatment harder create coronavirus, implore study retroviruses closely integrating DNA well hiv's high mutation rate, that's problem, many large clades HIV there. SARS vaccine little funding, never really got ground, canceled. comparable. beginning learn long term effects Covid. Scary. It’s unlikely catch mail really necessary. makes feel safe though. system able cope automatically? point lab data various identifiers. could use compare already create duplicates. could make know software notifies received duplicate.

Presumably system sophisticated they're write code specially fix hand. HIPAA applies certain entities (hospitals, healthcare adjacent, etc) don’t think it’s HIPAA issue, someone trying secretive. fact, intra-provincial borders China well open. Even Hubei's borders open since April. unified tracing system works regardless China from.

I indeed convinced one main reasons China's strategy proved successful able effectively cut hardest hit province rest country. knows whether lockdown could enforced countrywide scale. know, right? defunding pure applied sciences utter difficulty getting research grants investigation legitimate life-saving technologies, somehow able find funding utter horseshit.

As researcher hard sciences sometimes can't help utter disdain fields able secure funding fluff. Patient: pain

Doctor: Ok, i'll give prescription see Sneezologist Mr. Jones home office. follow two weeks via Zoom.

2 Weeks later

Patient Zoom: Doctor! Doctor! I'm excited barely breath. went see Mr. Jones, sneezed twice pain gone! Holy mother god... virus gives mercy. lots posters point out, plenty credible sources tear apart. French university student here. Even uni decided welcome 50% students week, still plan exams everyone (we're talking +400 people rooms, poor distancing, window all, two doors). first exams starting week.
Teachers know students worried, especially since finals december us come home family, right spending two weeks packed rooms.

It's even worse school. distancing younger students, lot schools barely open windows. 
There lot sick teachers heard. Kids 11 required wear masks. 

In field uni, know 6 teachers got sick week. yet know covid not. communication around cases. even report sick student. Presence mandatory, especially scholarship fund want lose it. make medical certificate using one disabilities get right skip classes. I'm worried. I've seen friend March July, seen two since then, always careful all. know do. go groceries, take public transportation buy something classes. government keeps saying almost one gets sick schools. Youre person read bleach smell like did. Food tasted horrible slighly metalic salty. Everything disgusting, bleach smell also accompanied slight fruttiness, like scented cleaning spray. True. clearly said beginning possible vaccine would reduce symptoms provide full immunity. No. doesn’t work like that. It’s random capitalism cope it. Vietnam hand amazing. gave people money. plandemic vaccinate us Bill-5G-Gates RFID microchips manipulate us vote Democrat!

Go end long post context translation. 

Regarding GDP economy think complicated. Swedens economy probably similar Germanys neighbours since export nation. simple fact Swedish economy 50% better eu average. (but like say complicated that) countries took huge dept boast GDP aswell. 

I believe best comparison discuss economy compare yourself. could resources saved. example
Sweden expected saved several billions - per day - shutting schools, time promised largest investment ever elderlycare. According UN Sweden already best elderlycare world. could argue shutting schools might actually also save elderly people long run. 

I appriciate Germany took childrens health conaideration, countries didnt this. Thats one reasons think Germany really good humane response. 

Regarding consumer spending thing actually seen argument Swedens volontarely recomendations effective locking people using police/military force. 

Here google translate parts recomendations regarding ban elderlycare visits. 

Regarding demonstrations agree you. like said complicated, someone wants demonstrate tell police might say you: "" Yes yes time etc"" . Usually organisers follow police suggestions. dont still allowed hold demo. difference holding demo endorsed police endorsed complicated. 

The BLM protests diring blanket 50 person ban example endorsed police also forbidden. 

Now demonstrations (or for) corona restrictions like countries (including germany think? ). reason try shut down. 

 ""Visit indoors outdoors, respectively possible, visits primarily received outdoors. one visits need received indoors, especially considered set higher demands measures need taken visit must able carried safe manner.

Just wash hands regularly (like even without covid), covid survivability surfaces problem you. know it’s crazy. fact don’t see coming fucking obvious beyond me. really think red hat man go without violence? New York University psychology professor Gabriele Oettingen told USA TODAY. important realize likely long-term fantasy, said. 

This pure rubbish. Going back normal long-term fantasy. New Zealand looks like **JUNE**. China looks like Vietnam **last week**. like New Zealand, China, Vietnam. question whether willing demand governments right thing. inadvertently involve people day. can't control spread virus to. could give grocery store clerk, fast food worker, grandparents. ""find risk acceptable"". simply irresponsible. arm, nose, eye Dead Space 2 style, protects us Corona i'm board surprise! think “The new coronavirus may remain infectious weeks banknotes, glass common surfaces, according research Australia’s top biosecurity laboratory highlights risks paper currency, touchscreen devices grab handles rails” pretty clear. **Remain infectious** key part.

So, basically, wash hands. please post rest article? can't find second part wapo let view it. deadliest pandemic, far it. Thank you, wasn’t able find one. know least one post deleted glad see discussion. Sorry right. says posted deleted still fault. Apologize repost doubt word, repost purpose. Completely different, freedom movement, GFA etc. many factors easy ""just ignore lockdown"" politics entire British isles fragile fuck regards GFA. Without GFA we'd still bloody conflict. everyone involved finds risk acceptable not? ‘Eat help out’

And lockdown?


Make fucking mind crying loud im convinced redditors live real world 100% agree means they’ve practically motorized goalposts Looking forward election USA. Pretty sure matter wins, covid news going page 10. Ooo McCloskeys, seen minute. Also can't believe Charlie Kirk's face really looks like that. local think fine is. narrative. exact quote president. yes, shortly started saying it, noticeable decrease number tests done nationwide, still case Trump ball sucking governors states Florida. test thousands people daily reason sports players supporting staff, yet can't find enough tests give people known exposure covid. plan. herd immunity impossible vaccine won’t work either. survive destroyed organs, notably lungs heart. Death poor outcome. Yeah, it’s funny examples earlier year. Md good example. Emergency orders already place. Bars restaurants already closed. Cases kept going 2 weeks mask mandate went effect around April 18th. started dropping steadily. maybe 2023. compounded every day needless death suffering. Devastating. Right broken heart. factual. tool know it. Normal Florida doing. gonna make way population eventually. keep close 1 million people alive, keep control ever makes comeback. real concern, either mutant strain immunity wanes quickly. Again, question actually matters ***transmissibility***: catch dollar bill, elevator button? Chances likely not. tell people starting IV them. It’s Combination arbitrary list countries top head also fairly large population, also didn’t include Singapore, Brunei, Mongolia etc. example. 

I’m asking question seems like pretty obvious one leave out, especially since epicentre outbreak. I’m white kniting China, I’m trying bring awareness positivity otherwise unfair negative press they’re getting past months. usually ask lie done usually accommodate. one time last years want that, fainted. ""Told so..."" vaxart pill may anwer want Woah slow turbo. say I’m masks? 100 support masks.

I’m talking lockdowns buddy, go read comment replying. Really? Fuck. Sorry check Shortly delete so. blatantly associating group climate denial black list thier views. Simple as.

The approach covid one size fits all. many countries could around world could avoid using lockdown thier health services would manage fine restrictions place. damage lockdowns causing society economies felt years. used last resort country can't handle situation. fucking idiots still vote red hat man. point is--they're overstepping bounds broad generalization. extreme outbreaks planet left national governments specifically ascertain whether harm good. one size fits statement. group batting 1000 Covid-10 issue. That's opinion. posted website buried big tech powers fit official narrative.

MY opinion people allowed work provide families overblown virus sub 1% death rate, much like flu, pumped half year left MSM last ditch effrot steal election. THat's opinion. delcaration nuance.

GO back chamber let adults life. Bruh ever Malaysia Ctrl f contagion 50%-50% placebo...Garbage article It’s new. It’s something since begginkng pandimic. would love following happen.   
  
 * Claim invent aerosolized vaccine.  
 * Start deploying dramatic fashion public places prone crowding.  
 * Anti maskers either mask-up prevent government mind control finally start staying home.  
 * Virus stops spreading  
 * Vaccine works.  
  
(it store bought air freshener whole time.) Let know recline lay first, also using butterfly needle smaller, try distract best can. done start read article , or?

Some losses recent months permanent. dark cloud coronavirus risk, meanwhile, continue linger – possibly years. 

""Normality"" means different things different people. Tragically, hundreds thousands Americans, pre-pandemic life would include loved one died COVID-19 year. 

For Americans, return normal would mean restored health financial stability. others, world concerts gatherings, hugs handshakes. 

There's nothing wrong hoping better, stable future, New York University psychology professor Gabriele Oettingen told USA TODAY. important realize likely long-term fantasy, said. aren’t police arrest them? difference is, Sweden they're definetely testing much.  Keep mind COVID-19 represents one strain also shut 1utama week due (2?) Cases there. Msia taking really seriously, hope hard work get back control supposed inject us 666 mind control chips Bill Gates made though. working.. everyday, without break...also..in feb hardly anyone anything new anything.. till end march till people really started use mask such.. trumps great.. watch 3 weeks turn 4 years. Source? summed one sentence like that.
 
It's absolutely software recreated. fact set status quo new breed product: social media platform  It’s good till ya find live virus🦠 Emotionally sure wouldnt significantly affect America’s continued existence economic output  Florida 16k deaths.  happened recently places stopped spread.. whay happens dont lockdown ignore safety protocols.  

Also percentage infected people die... Close one percent. 3500 people infected day florida right now.  35 going die... Precentable deatha anti mask karens like yourself.  Please wear fucking mask. covid using raw tested confirmed numbers appears kill 2%? take consideration CDC saying we're missing potentially x10 amount cases brings levels we're observing wild suppose. No, article posted yesterday sure anyone commenting read need ask really concerned look east. “Are concerned done unethically, done China?” asks. “I think two things often conflated.” Perfect time chance name anything *vaccine* address stupid ones among us circumvent idiocy. Yeah, talking anti-vaxxers. Totally misleading headline. one advocates lockdowns unless totally fucked.  Instead, try know works maybe don’t lockdown....but idiots US don’t understand fight advice designed prevent lockdowns. Yeah right! Loaded full bill gates’ tracking devices /s Nah, coherent. Corresponding author gmail email provider authors genomics company. hope credible. Sounds like lock flu Lol it’s called normal it’s called UNSAFE!!! anyone business 

So left trust? They’re bouncing back virus nonexistent now, easily seen traveling data. Domestically businesses normal, something country say maybe New Zealand. realize doubt numbers China gives strict handling virus, mass testing (can give 10 million tests 10 days one city) mandatory quarentkne foreigners adoptance masks make believe it. countries near zero cases less. 

Because normal still main provider manufacturing goods countries looking buyers go China. Also many countries printing money try boost spending, believe much money mainly going products made China may one providers shut severely impacted right now.

But isn’t say China wasn’t impacted, growth year much less previous years let us vaccine? reliable metric. 

Espionage trolls bots active ever. America broken, like heart. 

I going trouble ever forgiving people put us state. I'm even talking Trump cultists. I'm talking neighbors felt take trip Palm Springs contribute ""mass hysteria"". I'm talking jerk mortgage company wear mask cancelled refi.There's lot people unforgiven list.

My fellow Americans allowed happen personal carelessness obtuse selfishness. Worse, try justify precaution denial words like ""herd immunity"", promoting idea get people also careless, destructive unpatriotic. anybody needed encouragement. destruction America embraced enthusiasm anti-maskers precaution-deniers, still denying reality.

My fellow Americans brought us point history, shame you. Shame, shame shame you. blood hands. god, another one idiotic takes last 8 months? Uhm? IM injections vaccines hurt much simple IV draw.

Sure needle tiny, muscles really made amount liquid pressed them. US failed state. probably end civil war red hat man loses election threatens throw judicial system. nazi followers rise based rhetoric go. don’t see possible outcome. article depressing needed look kitten pictures. one good resources ETA vaccines?  truth truth. doesn’t mean wrong opening back also means science data supply scrutinized more. ANYONE agenda vetted. bad hindsight way people hoarded EVERYTHING, I'm sure telling truth would better. Imagine hoarders gougers made run masks, essential healthcare workers get any. would also disaster. Ewww, Fox  Honestly can't recommend Social Dilemma Netflix enough. explains well happened... hated flu mist. would come excuse feeling sick they’d give needle. 

But would take mist 100x Covid test. Jesus god bad. people would choose COVID spending last years couped up. people ready normal life think. echo chamber doesn’t represent us Don’t forget Kawasaki symptoms... kids SAFE!! Conveniently finds promising vaccine right election... Stay tuned ""11/15/20 officially beat worst virus known mankind! Go ahead take masks folks"". include you’ve vaccinated yourself?  OP what's prediction number hospitalisations deaths would result events? could give us update 4 weeks confirm came true? long compulsory, much backlash. TROLL! No. not. Blunt lie. Oh dear fucking Christ, Singulair. took period decade ago, legitimate way explain medication made feel, made feel absolutely wrong like myself. want compare anxiety that's quite right either. making sense?

I well controlled asthma Symbicort, good ol' inhaled steroids ftw.   quite bit tension cops, nasty habit murdering either innocent non-threatening folks, particularly white. protests across country, especially Portland seen 100 straight days. I’m glad see media, Reddit, science health community start question cost/benefit strict societal lockdowns. Months ago, merely asking question, “is locking society good idea”, downvoted hell. Now, people starting think rationally instead emotionally. Hopefully reverberates public policy decisions. Eastern too, we're stupid incapable making sacrifices collective good country. ._. I'm singulair, duo resp occassional steroids. first given montelucast googled know great side effects, find refrences looked treatment covid. She’s inquisitive. isn’t super smart it’s easy manipulate take advantage her. She’s got untreated underlying mental health issues, makes difficult discern what’s real isn’t. correct context thr current use lockdowns primary tool many countries, basis Barrington Declaration. inarguably condemn that. That’s incorrect. definitely would immune system isn’t perfect. People die common cold despite people typically protective immunity.

It correct. really know think people long lasting protective immunity coronaviruses. case. first .00005% cases really nothing draw conclusions from. number alone suggests sterilizing immunity lasts least long virus around.

As I've stated before, bar confirm reinfection high. needs stored sample first infection second infection. samples need sequenced viral genomes need sufficiently different. There's possibility person reinfected virus. However, there's way tell genomes different. Additionally, whole heck lot people samples stored (which see reinfections often health care workers whose samples likely stored internal 50% worse symptoms means protective immunity 50% mean?

The 50% cases worse upon reinfection. 81% symptomatic times. isn’t 50%, it’s 36%. 8 22. symptoms: 11 (50%) (72% symptoms) Worse symptoms: 8 (36%) Less symptoms: 3 (13%)

Math...and case history...learn it. 16 cases known outcomes.  get count ones say N/A ""no symptoms."" N/A means available, known. 8 worse, 3 less, 5 same. That's 50% worse symptoms. 18.7% milder symptoms. 31% symptoms. one drawing conclusions nothing. history coronaviruses one essentially permanent protective immunity. evidence contradict reason assume different.

Literally evidence points permanent protective immunity coronaviruses.  study, monitored reinfections, occur protective immunity (cellular and/or humoral) insufficient. show reinfections natural infection occur four seasonal coronaviruses, suggesting common feature human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Reinfections occurred frequently 12 months infection, indicating protective immunity short-lived.

Perhaps know enough immune system confusing protective immunity cellular immunity? Protective immunity tends mediated B cells antibody response. Cellular immunity mediated cell response. However, cellular immunity, nature cell response, indicates reinfection possible cell response requires already infected cells activation. time re-infection, race whether immune clearance fast enough symptoms appear. as? Look Indiana stage 4 5, even mask order inforced, check list Star Trek style! exactly. even take nasal flu shot, asthma definitely can't take this. might nice idea supplement actual shot, think lot people refuse spray live &amp; may cause minor symptoms. Woah. Dutch ancestry, PLUS Dutch surnames? Drs saying vaccine might need stored 100degress zero Wait... call dude troll?

You literally cut sentence halfway make fit point better. phased people getting infections brains dying it. Welp, hope that's last one Vaccine widely available March/April. agree totally.  I’m supplier. doer Thanks kids. (single) mother way. tons issues. one could stand left alone us. wish one single friend family member would stuck sake. long happens. #ftfy  That's awful need political system China.

With civil rights lawyers America, can't achieve success China has.

China dealt virus iron fist. US. Ahaha okay. Ah got me. Lol  COVID really shows us religious makes better compassion human. live NJ seeing climb pray stay another shutdown. instituted herculean measures prevent collapse. imported staff, materiel, medication US cases, world. every state went NY March time, talking one state's healthcare system collapsing. would talking every state's hc system collapsing. wtf thing Everything comes China regulated Chinese government, possibly changed make China look good.

So no. Yes start shutting bars restricting restaurant service first. Also make masks mandatory. answering line “we adopt”. adopt what? aren’t gunna live like forever. I’m discrediting experience don’t rely masks survive. I’m discrediting fact hard hearing. disability irrelevant don’t think majority people going continue mask mandates. yeah, maybe try reach hard. It’s bad back. tests rolled beginning flawed work Trump's admin suffer ego blow using foreign-designed-but-working test insisted CDC rush own.

They leaned violate policies standards Trump's ego turns policies standards excellent reason existing. Yeah big me. I’m totally vaccines stupid. case anyone forgot: flu vaccine worked like released mass scale found significant portion people caused infection went straight brain killed them. got pulled lots people died it. stupid thing novel virus. Massively same. hospital bedbound weeks daily blood thinning injections stomach. Sometimes literally feel thing sometimes caught wrong really hurt bothered all. Blood draws absolutely fucking detest. fair every time get stressed hell can't get blood out. difference thought needle going vein opposed going muscle- thought sends panic. actually lot better numbing cream arm that's something really hospital fair tests done. 7 day average ranked per capital deaths? Taking cumulative per capita deaths misleading. young people getting sick dying much less treatment improved. Interestingly, gave flu vaccines recently gave people option injection nasal flu mist. many people request needle like idea spraying fluid nose. pretty surprised that. Remember psychological. true Germany long time. seen team player caring fellow citizens. message, weak scared, want end care every life fellow citizens. people wear masks US willing pick gun die lives fellow country men, wearing mask go. stupid. War British Netherlands. took city renamed it. agree. reason wear masks threat still among us, safety precautions. Meanwhile Sweden Yes that’s correct that’s condemn means. think, would taken prevent misery every body sitting down, shutting fuck up, behaving couple months begining sitting home paid extra $1200 eat delivery still fun.

I showed said different things, therefore join.
If others highest rank subscribe, accept headline. I'm in! People like wearing masks it. I'll also to! UK country ~4 million people higher per-capita testing numbers US. Sorry disrupt narrative. Millions people reporting long terms terrible effects (fatigue,feeling unwell, difficulties breathe...) Covid deniers shamelessly compare virus flu... say though already. Alex Jones actually serious non-ironically watched people. Specifically respiratory viruses intranasal may effective promotes immunity site infection. Also lot intramuscular vaccines development mRNA based might terribly effective anyway. Adenovirus based vaccines probably effective potential safety issues course thoroughly investigated clinical testing. States like California done good European nation (tech, pop culture, etc). mainly flyover states done much Non-shitty masks include surgical masks, n95 masks, kn95, kf94, etc yes. are. people get fucking heads get numb it. media barely even reports anymore.  correct. really know think people long lasting protective immunity coronaviruses. case.

Of course it’s case. I've stated before,
 bar confirm reinfection high. needs stored sample first infection second infection. 

The facts know, could possibly be. 50% cases worse upon reinfection. 81% symptomatic times.

8 50% 22. Math...and case history...learn it. 16 cases known outcomes.  get count ones say N/A ""no symptoms”.

Sure can. can’t say they’re asymptomatic say Literally evidence points permanent protective immunity coronaviruses. title article doesn’t seem relevant. discusses immunity reinfection, protection disease. Perhaps know enough immune system confusing protective immunity cellular immunity? 

Maybe. Nothing I’m saying really dependent though. I’m talking whether there’s reason think covid severe future now. Whether people susceptible it. Re-reading discussion I’m sure you’re saying different. still think long way go, hopefully broad shift soon!

Which step back see forest trees. pyrrhic victory reason opinion shifted simply shifted people self-delusional fantasies via political propaganda. Todd Clorox? 

Are Clorox Man Clorox Plan? legal California? oh yeah full antivaxxers people watch TV sunday remove rooster hens get fun day Lord Masks everywhere part solution primitive countries people homes need daily forage food. countries afford FOLLOW SCIENCE, lockdowns MUST enforced !! Well, think people moving inside risky, think schools would be?  would happen without Trump would higher. There’s many damn haters someone played little bit panic everyone save PPE people hospitals need it. He’s done Hillary Biden would combined pandemic one expected speaks behalf WHO.

I find odd Trump says something, people like point necessary represent United States America. dude works WHO, even head WHO, suppose represent entire organization.  Iran far know suprisingly west Asia found right flair. least Gates won’t able inject chip clear distinction first second waves US. states largely spared June (Florida, Texas, California, pretty much everywhere besides Northeast/Louisiana/Washington state) still significantly lower death tolls compared states hit first wave. first wave never ended, states like Texas wouldn’t per capita death toll that’s 1/3 NY/NJ mean Gal Gadot?

Yikes deez nuts! Nope. Two countries bunch idiots make either set idiots less idiotic. I'm opposite -- mind blood drawn, feeling liquid vaccine pushed weirds every time, even though needle smaller. I'll still get vaccinated, though -- heck, already give two shots month walk less pain, I'll take million means dying covid it! think I’m headed direction. Never ever issues blood draws injections, point would labs send inexperienced tech practice lol. last time muscular injection, also happened neck, oh man walls start closing in. Thought going pass puke time. 
And reaction, I’m nervous next time something similar (which happens next week). I’m sure pre-anxiety contribute another reaction.

But yeah, proven, safe vaccine, I’m in. I’d like able see parents often. friends. coworkers. And..people general? SCIENCE... enough you... ? NAC sounds stupid Antivaxxers hold breath!! update I’ve seen ZERO forums articles this. I’d love know science behind particular situation. W0t m8? Cocaine kills Coronavirus lie get it. Huh super trivial you’re welcome. told mom, would solution. Inhaler nasal mist vaccine, thought crazy. want vaccine come country, anytime already. want escape always agitated spouse every little thing frustrates her. She’s also OCD, imagine many times asks me, “Did wash hands?” Jesus. don’t mean sound anti-vaccine, explaining flaws compared traditional vaccinations id hate patient. stubborn nurses like kake worse. ""Man stop fucking baby little needle"" know helps doesnt thank you. California here. mother sister got colds. mom secondary caretaker sister’s kids, dad idiot signed football practice fucking pandemic. tell mom pretty sternly got cold easy could catch COVID. 

It’s frustrating. Let guess, assuming I'm Covid-denying anti-masker? even close - bitching storm May Texas reopened quickly without precautions, think we're headed second wave may worse we've seen far.

But point still valid - news? daily death toll -- going start posting every day?  would live vaccine? can't get due immune deficiency Thanks lecture assuming don’t care things. school teach inequity issues make online learning almost non-starter many families. pandemic started local conservative government cut education funding pushed online courses hard. went picket lines it. People already believe this, think contrails that’s airplanes leave sky full mind control chemicals, therefore calling ‘chem trails’. mother somehow thinks this, it’s really annoying. She’s relatively normal person otherwise. Weird praised China it...hmmmm... also destabilize existing arterial plaques cause heart attack (same flu) Southern Utah different SLC.

Dr. David Nabarro appealed world leaders yesterday, telling stop “using lockdowns primary control method” coronavirus.

He also claimed thing lockdowns achieved poverty – mention potential lives saved.

“Lockdowns one consequence must never ever belittle, making poor people awful lot poorer,” said. live Midwest. city hit hard, people taking seriously all. lake packed every weekend - events like county fair high school football games. Hardly anyone wears mask.

It's frightening frustrating. go well? Cool, let's go immunity. read article doesn’t condemn lockdowns  Nurses working Covid patients tend get much higher viral load Joe Sixpack restaurant. likely vaccine saved life gave milder case Covid. heard Australia one best flu season. B memory cells rapidly respond new infection. tiny number people get reinfected, probably due undiagnosed immune dysfunction. right Amsterdam's Netherlands' top hot spots within like supermarkets, compliance around 50%... go well accepting climate change. Well, that's wrap folks. ELE let's go. Yeah, that's can't simply vaccinate vulnerable get lives. elderly immunocompromised still risk even get vaccinated.

It pains say this, there's good possibility Covid vaccine effective enough us get back ""old normal"" long long time. might need hunker way we're now, doubt us attend crowded concert indoors without masks next 5 years. right thinking vaccine stop getting it? reduces symptons? so, what's issue? studies since suggest originated Sept early October.  guess never know. Influenza 60% mortality worst strains. Fortunately developed human human spread. 10 times worse bad seasonal flu strains. don’t understand anyone needs convincing. far I’m concerned it’s whiners complain something simple wearing mask. Gee, fucking hardship them! 🙄 prove it, giving big hugs kisses Repub friends.  golf course designers apparently. nannies kids avatar crew also.

And Jacinda tells everyone ""be kind"", seperates children partners NZ Citizens parading kid partners isntagram. Kind mind-blowing really. US? throughout world? really think 194 countries creating appearance pandemic impact US elections? Take notes western world. Watch learn. NL, every 5 patients hospital , approx one admitted ICU. Germany, approximately same. Jesus Christ. course get looks. That's overkill. also deaths per capita neighbors, several times seriously sick children? Assuming lab already submitted daily data before, pipe already though. probably timing case takes long done inside reporting window, get resolved next day. Yeah people could died. plural anecdote data. mistake. Sorry misleading anyone. Trump, Johnson Christie seem demonstrate long access good healthcare, matter obese unhealthy are. without die.

Does seem right? doesn’t prove anything. Trump admit COVID serious threat would mean he’d admit entire strategy dealing virus past 6 months wrong. Trump lacks cognitive abilities admit EVER wrong anything. Therefore, play defence. lives Americans entirely contingent massive ego insecure narcissist power. really highlights failures populist leaders actually look leading nations Well I'm Dutch must say behavior appalling. additionally: people making random comments wearing mask like sarcastically shouting 'Good going pal!' random Maroccan kids making fun (always groups 3+) me. Also, random old people barging supermarket without wearing mask think is: man, got death wish. correct goodwill squandered incompetent politicians, eradication remains workable approach. left heavy hand. Closing non-essential shops, working home, curfew, travelling 5km home, etc. hard slog, positive part see results within weeks, turning 20,000 cases per day 200. numbers low enough contact tracing operate.

It takes strong leadership, putting murdoch jail cell. fucked April, left since seems antibodies last expected mutations invalidate vaccine attempts. trouble Haredi’s rules always tweaked suit needs/wants regardless. aunt 10 children, 40+ grandchildren live lives based Rabbi tells tells want hear based number teachings. least 1 reason anything within Torah. guys need routine structure idea live independently. COVID rules forced kill get back it. COVID forced think pray own, don’t like it. guess numbers listen people know healthcare systems inside. Awesome thanks man. entire world? Haha that’s funny. think people Korea, Taiwan, Australia, hk, Vietnam look sweden say ‘hey wish like that’. Really ?? Lol
Edit: btw America whole world :) data masks clear enough recommend them, convince certain people wear them? thorniest issue mind. Pretty much. Derangement syndrome that


People pro vaccine turn antivaxxers come election. stay closed forever outside world. way, clear outsiders corrupting NZ. like Sweden failed earlier everyone else rest catching now. one idiot keeps bringing up. I'm comparing total cases recorded hospitalisations ICU. 

I'm saying roughly number inpatients compared ICU Germany NL strongly suggests major difference ICU admission criteria. 

If higher ICU hospitalisation ratio one country argument would make sense, really.

To put simply, numbers clear. hospitalised Germany likely admitted ICU someone hospitalised NL. Probably best comment I've seen sub since created. Wish gold give you, friend. another article clearly states know received placebo. Yep, family film crews America's Cup workers able circumvent rules apply everyone else. mean sub also full fear mongers thought 10% death rate like SARS society going collapse Yeah, countries listed comparison. didn’t mean countries world. probably already knew countries world lockdown March. Sometimes vaccines ""sterilizing"", case prevent nearly 100% infections, example rabies smallpox. Sometimes vaccines ""protective"", case prevent infections, reduce symptom severity infections failed prevent, example flu chickenpox vaccines. seasonal flu vaccine estimated reduce symptom severity 80% cases could prevent.

The phase 1/2 data current COVID vaccine candidates ranged good spectacular. produced sterilizing antibodies nearly 100% time (the lowest 92%), hopeful COVID vaccines sterilizing protective. However, phase 3 data say sure whether antibody results translate real-world effectiveness.

In case vaccines cannot achieve sterilizing effect, still protective, people infected vaccination less symptoms non-vaccinated people, therefore less infectious know large Chinese contact tracing study infectiousness directly correlated symptom severity. /r/COVID19/comments/iccj85/contact_settings_and_risk_for_transmission_in/ probability patient infected close contact 0.3%, asymptomatic, 3.3% mild, 5.6% moderate, 6.2%for severe critical cases. (Note asymptomatic means people remained symptom-free though *entire* infection. confused pre-symptomatic, phase people infectious.) way end reply chain deaths. new cases, current hospitalizations people intensive care. rounded France little bit data day older. Disagree. best thing that's ever happened China since Nixon Trump. call comrade super secret agent Trump. president USA dronestriked US citizen posts declaration. one. Furthermore, unknown injected placebo not. Jesus article garbahe. shut up.  clean sanitize vehicles.  click bait garbage. country grow Q1? beg differ. know really good comparison numbers least somewhat similar. R value much different countries. think shows reporting also totally different country. Wtf talking man? We're saying thing. 

All provide interview title article taken from. stated opinion validity comment claim made.

So there's nothing 'agree disagree' over, unless claiming video fake? matter think way argue. study indicating this. That's matters. (and our) opinions biased. studies not. since it’s essentially clotting disorder, cause thrombosis cardiac arrest strokes. deaths young people often strokes. I'd guess dry winter indoor air weakens mucosal function evaporation. Thereby, rapid aerosol evaporation, increases inoculum coming contact mucosal surface. know growth Q1 decline Q2 represents bigger drop surge much higher, honest comparison would look quarters combined.

Yeah, going +0.1% Q1 - 8.6% Q2 (Sweden) bigger difference going -0.9% Q1 -7.4% Q2 (Finland) -1.9% -6.3% (Norway). lockdown March meant Finland/Norway's economy affected Q1, Sweden's continued surge till June meant Q2 fared worse others.

Is *honest* point making? dangerous middle pandemic also seems control crowd. panic, lot people stomped death. makes say that? Covid19 came via Europeans Americans. Centralized vs decentralized, hierarchical vs cooperative, precaution vs reaction, lean vs redundant  part world (East, South East Asia, Oceania) travel bubble everyone else get acts together. I'm sure consider reliable, seen bunch bloggers live China reports mostly same, life mostly back normal except masks still required indoor spaces regions required scan ""health app"" entering contact traced later. Otherwise restrictions. Golden Week right now, domestic travel 80% level previous years.

The current strategy seems test essential workers regularly (the Qingdao dock workers tested every two weeks), contact trace aggressively (either using app publishing movements new domestic cases close contacts identified isolated. still fails reveal source infection, move city-wide testing, batch technology allow test millions week two, done 5 cities far. still aiming eradication, although government credibility issues, think numbers plausible, either hide numbers extremely aggressive contact tracing, cannot both. Netherlands deep second wave new cases rising every day

If people follow science. Maybe need anymore time shipped. They've city. pool rides, nobody front seats, ac, windows open masks required. I've taken 2 rides day months far good. Germany lagging behind couple weeks? Numbers going currently :( pic, two guys mask blow nose, kids, well nourished kids less doubt it. company reports NHSN module. heath care company though. You’re talking straight ass. Let's agree disagree read voice salad fingers. clue voice came mind. /r/MurderedByWords Ray Dalio - Principles 

Talks study empires what?

you'd rather people died? No, old ppl r racist generalize Western countries. New Zealand eradicated virus too. America messed up, doesnt mean west messed sure replying me? provide video timestamp said. allow massive international travel Asia, cases deaths resume.

They need stay closed till vaccine. reads like disclaimer end weight loss pill commercial list possibility every side effect known man. umm..ever? definitely fascist Oh, that's interesting. 

Remind me, flu particle free saliva again? 

Oh, what's turbulent flow again?

And come larger droplets contain viable virus? Radio lab episode sun used help people Spanish flu. Invisible Allies

and history hospital allows Covid-19 patients dose sunshine vitamin study offers promising results

its shame cant learn history rofl umm , far commonly anowledge , fact , claim made TYrump Pompeo , , statistically speaking , wouldnt say comes trump likely lie?

&amp;#x200B;

The general consensus outside insane conspiracy theorist maiac insane people like Trump &amp; regime artificial 10% lol.

Even doomerish scientific estimates suggest 0.5% take account asymptomatic cases. probably used private jet visa/pr/citizenship replies top say otherwise, flip like awkwardly turn. line mo speaking vitamin-d blood level relevant dosage. dosage needed achieve certain blood level vary widely different people. would argue 40-60ng/ml good target. Israel started year long lockdown. go back lockdown, expect get 2021. worked stayed home kept distance. people tired care anymore.  Indeed, showing west must gets shit done.

Decades hedonistic spoiled behaviours corrupt society. 

We slowly going towards car crash still holding foot accelerator.

We may end like Roman Empire even worse like Aztecs get shit together soon. nuts? wont kill probably leave permanent damage , get much likely kill Mississippi free range comes wearing masks now. Thankfully 75% people see grocery stores wearing masks honestly surprises me. feel stupid getting panic attacks I’m around large amount people aren’t wearing masks state Covid hotline damn house almost 90 days still showing symptoms still fever. absolutely could leave unless without fever 3 days row. started showing symptoms 10th. tried fight much phone didn’t leave house. Police patrolled day sometimes stopped front home. day, exactly 7 months later, still fever goes throughout day. live alone very, sick mainly neurologically.

I’m taking chances getting sick different strain. 

Sorry lengthy comment. Please stay safe, y’all.  That's one main reasons IMO, protect real estate value. Probably good time get social media avoid that. mean? sais ""nationwide""... Death worst thing come covid sever ties Quest dump 75k ( granted , result really old). time it’s 400k 5 times much. Wonder take action .. HIV eradicated

And yet, we've still needed adjust lifestyles order accommodate altered state world arisen insurgence HIV. Better education protection-wearing, even abstinence! anti-drug campaigns! Greater precautions involving blood donations! Society becoming generally less promiscuous before!

Yes, everyone follows these, even areas required law. new messages effective, ingrained society across generation lines, considered part ""new normal"" ongoing HIV pandemic. imagine COVID-19 pandemic similar effects brave world children grandchildren. [Ruh Yikes sub full Covid deniers. Mods must allow misinformation harassment. Europeans confused America contain virus putting record numbers. there's significant portion US needs see it, annoying see everyday whole year. Looking similar pictures, wonder pictures show medical staff, wearing ponchos similar? required potential dealing covid positive people? 40% what? Supporters current administration? I'm mutualist, one analyze reality situation realize lockdowns devastating response kill people next decade covid will, realize masks marginally better nothing best. I'm probably far left dems economically, value freedom security buy hysteria porn ""left"" do. Fuck tavern league. breaking news water wet. UK Spain 1%

wrong. 0.8%

You could googled 1 France, IFR 0.8% well goes UK. googling everything.

Please provide accurate information. blame belongs leaders. hell about. bought time, time stock piling medical supplies, development therapeutics, we're closer vaccine now, plus meant healthcare systems overwhelmed. almost feels like labs FL trying jack count.  mean, thinking 0.8%, studies Spain UK pointed to. 0.2% lower better nothing. That's terrified March, math. slowing spread (not best many following mitigation efforts) people like ""wow guys totally wrong!"" dipshits, actively fought virus even like 60% compliance able slow down. Imagine could 75%, 90%? 

Probably would able go parties get margaritas already hated *acknowledging virus* wanted *actually get back normal.*

You played yourselves. Enjoy prolonged mitigation time.


Edit: talking you. cool. I'm talking stubborn anti mitigation people. nothing like flu.  I've since January fucking WILD much changed. Sadly true.  let cat know, thanks. Child marriages USA typically pre-teen teen female adult male. countries I'm well versed in. doubt bunch teens marrying other. usually younger girl.  right way things would full shutdown three weeks. 

The virus doesn’t look like it’s anywhere near tamed. Einstein alive would reminding world thing expecting different results insanity.

People spreading virus, there’s one else blame. Asians obedient authority thats capacity even question there.

It used back August fraction cases France currently experiencing: Korea's low case tally even compliance, two things:

-closed borders

-a high-tech, highly intrusive tracing system.  know 65 disease mortality rate 0.02%. disingenuous misleading state mortality rate 0.6%.

Isn't using 65 cutoff disingenuous misleading too? age might working probably best years 65-75 time hopefully bit money (yeah, know) enjoy retirement things working life. Well done completely oversimplifying generalizing every anglophone country World, tell Asian. Unlike countries named Europe completely reliant freedom movement open borders keep economies running shared currencies everything interconnected, cant simply shut borders indefinitely forever without completely destroying economies good. CFR. evidence claims? I've provided mine, can't provide yours? heard something called ""anecdotal evidence?"" 

You think 3 wealthy men best healthcare world admitted hospital day 1 illness reflect outcome average Americans, sent home told come back near death?  volunteer tribute test assumption. idk weather something incidence virus, thing (if heard right) winter, cases common colds diseases might traduce decrease hospitalary capacity. 

but point, really know don´t know anything all.

(sorry broken english) I’m angry this. 100 years ago influenza courts faced fines JAIL time wearing masks. 100 years ago nearly RESISTANCE wearing masks save people’s lives. 100 years later idiocracy real life live blows mind many educated people stupid. seem misrepresenting third source, 20% world’s pop Covax program alone. Places like US, UK, EU got individual purchases vaccines, believe UK something stupid like 300m spread around several different ones. Russia/China seem trying vaccines they’re probably covered (assuming work okay)

Also good luck pushing complete eradication hospitalisations deaths go background levels, which’ll happen way 95% mark malls protests everyone wears masks, result super spreader events. Additionally many countries issues mask culture know. anti-lockdown person. ""this big deal"" type. try push clearly-incorrect death rate. 

I giving good-natured ribbing since admitted death rate changes based various factors (which lockdowns sometimes necessary). Yes, site making net defense unhappy. I'm arguing measure.

Just variable looking changes, mean must something else changes explain it. static property underlying cause. example, places first hit hard covid large, urban areas, dense populations high connectivity world. sound like someone knows nothing minority life America. Great job, New Zealand Australia. heading summer. envious. said would right sentence. “There’s PROOF ALIGNS WANT!”

Fixed means reach 450000 deaths herd immunity? Also TBF, democrats 100 years ago less = today's Republicans. names parties really matter anymore splits changes morphing did. can’t use 7.5m number, countless others never got tested didn’t symptoms. flu number 49m estimated. you’re comparing case fatality rate flu infection fatality rate Covid. work places. makes think even masks effective theory lab, won’t effective real life enforced home, work kind social gathering. even possible desirable?

If could done voluntarily would problem, enforce otherwise? really hope every store decides stay mandatory big F U everyone hates them. mind em, maybe employees everyone else should. Location factor. Tom Hanks travelling US. Meanwhile, stories trapped citizens months ago said get flight, either booked capacity grounded. US never stopped outgoing flights, warnings destinations. Smaller airline companies running flights going cost more.

The 100,000 estimate I've never given details got estimate. Many Australians duel citizens duel citizens may choosing abroad pandemic idea they're included estimate. Duel citizenship may also issue means return Australia considered priority. Again, idea included estimate. money important repatriating 100000 Australians stuck abroad due caps incoming flights?

That's kind it. I'm amazed little scandal all. fuck citizen for, prevented returning home country.

We're quite well setup island-quarantining people, done refugees past decades. Unless cause conditions like prisons thus fit citizens. Belgiums shopping street Brussels crowded.

A part belgian population doesnt care. Also parts Brussel foreigners show 15% positive test rates.

Still politicians dont guts. know 65 disease mortality rate 0.02%. disingenuous misleading state mortality rate 0.6%.

It's likely much lower almost 80% cases asymptomatic. Thanks detailed write-up. familiar what's going WV, got list states article. Judging written above, hope guys vote out!! Everyone weak get COVID. anything, I'm moderate assessment.

Retirement had/has eroding late old age throughout decade, given massive recession/depression kick virtually beyond reach young middle-aged people today.

Also vitamin deficiency increases chance death.  Make sure take vitamin supplements. Here's information vaccines different types coronavirus affect cats, dogs, cattle Italy. Yet... 220,000 Americans died. never thought could admire federal employee much admire Dr. Fauci. disease doesn’t need eradicated things normal. HIV eradicated, Spanish flu eradicated, Yersinia Pestis, agent behind Black Death, eradicated. live among us, pretty okay things like big events international travel. Covid, honestly, relatively mild compared diseases. anyone age 50, it’s really particularly dangerous risk comparison things like driving, that’s without vaccine. Get vulnerable elderly vaccinated vaccine works them, won’t much need restrictions hospitalizations deaths necessarily drop. 

As 20%, that’s gonna worldwide. richest powerful countries receiving vaccine first. think you’re sort right- 2022 may still travel advisories countries like, say South Africa, perhaps travel bans there’s particularly bad outbreak going on.

Please provide evidence, searched found nothing death spray. looked forecast couple Upper Midwestern cities, look cold right now. leave life long chronic fatigue syndrome, permanently damaged hearts, lung scaring. actually kind bad thing young children get flu shot. hypothesised first flu infection imprints immune system determines handle flu later life. early exposure lead pretty disastrous consequences theorised 1918 pandemic quite idiosyncratic age groups killed. depends objective. Besides New Zealand Asian counties, lockdown countries seeing resurgence cases. way control virus (in terms cases) either lockdown indefinitely bring cases count 0 close borders.

I don’t believe temporary lockdowns work. eventually get cases small amount, spread lift lockdown. 

Then get whole debate whether lockdown harm (economically, socially, educationally, etc) good. rolling average? Hospitalizations? need provide money single parents hire babysitters. Cancel entire program!! personally knew someone died influenza.
Still, least order magnitude western IFR, half contagiousness. 99.9 43 previous spike couple months ago largely within communities well Maple Leaf meat processing plant, spread Brandon surrounding area. elevated restrictions successful large, spread-out area low population densities.

The recent spikes reportedly community transmission Winnipeg, way, *way* worse, given density, number bedroom communities surrounding it, common destination travel Manitoba shopping, etc. elevated well, numbers still spiking almost two weeks increased restrictions little late enforcement nonexistent. dragging feet *everything*.

Ultimately, caused arrogant jackass premier opening quickly allowing travel western Canada without quarantine. Everyone /r/winnipeg knew it, predicted it, are. [It took literally 50,000 screaming fucking insane government keep mandatory quarantines place travelers eastern provinces, weeks pushing give mandate masks schools buses. going take fighting still get control. depends finding Chinese government. ask sharing info?

As far tell worked like charm country.

Are places failed? (I heard people say UK Scotland) go cinemas **Inhaled Vaccines** **won’t require needles** 

water wet didn’t dawn seeing news morning back normal China right now. Streets packed people masks on, restaurants bars, even concert halls. quote journalist it’s like covid never even happened there. Now, population much bigger US huge cities metropolises. beat virus effectively? “draconian measures?” lasted 2 months, they’re home free now. Instead we’ve gone 7 months partial shut downs. get us? still tons new cases daily, highest world deaths per day. I’m afraid never go away finally take kids gloves decide strict lockdown. fact it’s important lock make vaccine work.

It’s late get done. start lockdown vaccine released introduce vaccine badges. order outside home either present vaccine badge, appointment you’re way get vaccinated. buy airline tickets, make hotel reservations, order online goods etc, attend school, etc present vaccine badge. enforce need use drones AI. badge tracker drone detects movement tracker, police automatically dispatched quarantine movement. think also mandate covid breathalyzer installed every car US blow (or spit) negative car start. Come it’s 7 months hell going decide FIX mess? Given number deaths could already prevented people wore mask wore correctly, may well prepare herd immunity hard way comes everyone getting simple injection. don’t get hate myself, I’ll respect it. tell don’t like it?

My heart goes family friends. Why?  Sing less loudly lol. dumb motherfuckers Lol gotta stay number 1!! brazil catching up!! usa !! usa!! usa!!!  late January, Chinese scientists saying virus dangerous Europeans claims virus flu, would believe European scientists? Sounds like compulsory mass medication tbh What's rolling average at?  Nearly 8 billion  Let guess, never worked elderly people? definitely die loneliness loneliness brings. Yeah there’s way could know article shouldn’t published first place anyone see movie ""I Legend""? Inhalable vaccine cancer gets mass deployment world ends? Anybody? translate american? 
Ok, I'll translate it. It'd something like 60.000 US cases. cities are, least They’re talking converting drive test sites vaccine sites Fair enough, im medically knowledgeable person. thought booster something different. put dome around area prevent travel from? Dublin greater population density Malmo though thats nonsense. discussing intuitive lot people. words, something lot people think about/are aware of. Ok nothing headline article

It’s like articles early days said kids dont spread Covid, kids literally let houses Like squirt gun? Ross really wished thing years ago. monica’s hand it! Pretty sure 99 percent uptime means almost 4 days per year. Maybe meant 99.9 percent? Yeah. hope people begin getting wise begin reshape policy surrounding income inequality. I'm also curious longer impacts COVID work home be. I've heard increasing people moving state may help soften bit hyper competition going there. That’s literally vaccine lol Glad state well country whole terrible. one question. China says virus spread via international cold chain ships sea food, West says cannot. believe? Wo AI Beijing Tiananmen, mention pie young Chan? Yes stay date “grim milestones” someone doesn’t chuck article onto sub every time country passes new 10k mark. HIV test usually isn’t blood draw, finger prick I’m different ups store address box vpn provider? Happened middle school science class watching surgery video, even worse, taking wilderness first aid training, watching video shock guy hang-gliding crashes bleeding out! Also happens whenever get blood drawn. tell nurse vasovagal syncope they'll help out. mean thing single major symptoms, returned field 10 days later made NLDS? Yeah, remember think youve completely misunderstood him. saying interprets Swedens actions considering lockdown first time. Actually, person placebo group, would great news. need certain number placebo group get infected, one either group got infected would idea whether vaccine working not.

People find group study over, find early change behaviour, could make data worthless. giving health advice. Lockdows causes human suffering, question measures negative effects positive.

I think find things worth it. cover up. lab released genome virus. inaccuracies data, would derail response countries, lab shut review approach make sure genome released reliable. think lockdowns targeted small areas. Another MCO lockdown kill economy.. US stop using nasal flu vaccines? doesn’t kill quickly get help monitor oxygen levels get oxygen. many long term effects people get. government fucking job properly. They're island yes politics complex Australia NZ fucking island small population. Ops name Hillary_Clinton Yeah way entire life diagnosed cancer. Getting chemo blood draws every three months really made deal needles better. 

I still cringe look away though haha Yes mask advice disaster. people like problem  Come dude. That’s obviously stupid. 

You need get powerful light INSIDE body. Well yes no, might show simple comparison states googling cough information, however given pandemic, volume search elevated, 7 day search volume be, even places wr know high volume covid infections, top 5 highest volume search term but, far know, adjust population means north dakota googling Cough california, new york, florida, despite massively smaller search volume general. It’s really bad... mind matter bc needle hurts literally second Known Issues

While believe model strong, models limitations reduce complex reality simple system. aware following limitations model interpreting results:

* model relies upon valid data COVIDTracking.com, turn rely states provide timely accurate data well. Unfortunately, data noisy, incorrect, delayed, otherwise wrong. average, believe data correct, times errant datapoint throws model off. Please let us know see instance this.
* model attempts correct testing looking essentially positivity rate. positivity rate changes time group people tested changes. anything, model may understate Rt currently far people without symptoms tested, thus driving positive percentage overstating downward trend cases.
* model relies upon distribution delay infection reported positive test. data used generate distribution Germany handful countries – quite possible delay distribution may look different US state state. jesus....

also, irresponsible trump say ""it's trending down"" like really dude? good attitude towards criticism great quality, yeah don’t sell short well-done project! look. It’s really control. state, mass, rising cases abit right it’s control. control now, ever since first spike. still pretty strict things opening back up. Mask mandate seems like everyone taking seriously. we? pump stonk boys!! fuck yea Already August: Tegnell keeping open mind. “Face masks complement things things safely place. start face masks think crowd buses shopping malls — that’s definitely mistake,” said, adding countries Belgium Spain widespread mask use still rising infection ECDC \[European Centre Disease Control\] \[World Health Organisation\] others write, might situations face masks might good addition things; see outbreak starting up, places can't avoid crowding on, might need face masks see epidemiology moving direction unfavourable.  Sweden fairly sharp decrease cases. Adding face mask situation maybe right move. see problems again, course look face masks look measures see situations might make difference. need remember face masks protect getting ill belong risk group, safe way looking it.""

===

You using Norway example. difference death rates Norway Sweden indicative effectiveness (or not) masks prevent deaths, since time difference death rates accumulated neither country used masks. 

Also, find Tegnell spoken countries asked media country's officials. fact, repeatedly said measures implemented certain country might applicable another even regions country. reddit one gets impression Sweden trying push strategy countries across world. longer go without catching better science treatments be.

In ways we’re never going “back” anyway. I’ve come realization dining restaurant weird weird pressures, like hurry want flip table. I’ve realized gross gyms developed great regimen outdoors. bought massive 4K TV likely never return movie theater (I trending way anyway). I’ve gotten comfortable fact people want spend time with. 

I miss vacations I’ve also realized overspent sometimes strange pressure well. Must visit family, must travel, must keep wife happy.

There going back, new future make want. Europe English speaking countries failed enough take seriously enough.

Thank you. Governments cannot trusted country's best interests mind, good reasons. incompetent, corrupt weak. effectively leadership, everyone whatever please, leading uncontrolled spread.

Ultimately, Asian model collectivism strong government future. Trump hates China knows China winning US losing, installing petty dictators answer either.

And light West dies.  comes ""all Christians bad"" comments people lost minds ""systemic racism"" Orange hair? weirdly comforting realize ""Bible Belt"" idiots ruining everything world, US. a\*\*holes \*\*THE PROBLEM\*\* hundreds years already, seem slowing all. Super frustrating. Yeah - head sand approach. We’ll see happens. Either isolate doesn’t harm second order effects economy way vaccine. - stretching bad situation last long possible whole country dry tinder future infections add additional economic hard waiting. Private schools open full person class learning month heard outbreaks within city. So, union thing uncomfortable school conditions ie ventilation, breaks, etc... sure hell see lot teachers drink inside outside restaurants without masks on, I’m leaning towards it’s bully union thing. It’s argument. It’s dishonest source though especially pointing out. Keep arguing bad faith. Good day! Open eyes  ‘The kids best parent aid sitting right next them’ - soooo Person assistance child. stand assessment. imagine next big conspiracy theory vaccines. putting vaccines air mind control....or ever. Maybe get assholes wear masks people may try live breathing. Also know like nose spray thing inhaler setup, mean nutters going to..... nut... ewwww. 43.8% population.. close 65% United States still lot people.

That said half population Netherlands religion. moving right direction. oh idea whats brewing india....teeheehee😆 follow news much. explain lie? practice, lot dutch people are, (like european countries) long history religion, definitely doesnt entirely disappear either - especially bible belt. Bremen Berlin 50 already, states positive growth new cases. Certainly Berlin rest ""pretty Actually can't. School compulsary, wife would fired turn work. I'm 100% home I'm OK, employer norm. seriously cite something March 16. even data says 5 percent mechanical ventilation (which longer even valid). simple look total number icu beds utilized covid daily infected (accounting asymptotic antibody+ people) tell way off. simple analysis possible ppl like you, read shit can't parse data properly. 

Here's simple number calculate... 200k 80 year olds dead, going spend 10 trillion combat this. equals 50 million per dead unhealthy 80 year old spending. Here's another simple number, 725k dead per year heart disease, recur infinitely. ban sugar red meat? spend 50 million year ppl? Wouldn’t great major discovery made rona researchers, fight different issue - saves lives rona taken? dunno, cancer maybe? Trump fans Italy? hard hearing. rely fanning people seeing lips move. still support wearing masks. People adapt. asked speak later write something down. hasn’t states mandates? Right that's best cars senario. exactly around corner. “Beat it” means temporarily suppress it. Sweden seems likely beaten it. That's less one third per capita max Arizona had.

Yes bad, proof well earlier year.  Imagine means economic competition. Western companies tanking, Chinese filling void unprecedented rate. Probably forever like we've seen many industries. odd China, New Zealand Australia spiral default.

Could EU eurozone already rotten core? Hitler fascist voted in?? /s Fuck Several countries Europe require mandatory quarantine test upon arrival,

Am European. Well half international travellers ignore governments care enforcement. Lots people said that, weren’t scientists everyday person medical background. know “stay warm you’ll catch cold”. Cases = Good. Deaths = Bad meant write ""herd mentality."" Soul-chillingly terrifying absolutely best way describe that. like watching Aztec religious festival. end, know. I'm suggesting use logic co-worker's logic. Many foreigners buy real estate NZ.  CDC saying number cases far higher, may closer 15 20%

Doesn’t really work effectively new children born year isn’t vaccine though. Smallpox didn’t go away natural herd immunity. Lost track fudging numbers? begs question, thing eventually going us? I’m curious channels one get harvested organ. know mega rich exchange students family hard time getting new liver etc. wouldn’t easy since there’re millions camps harvest? HOH coworker relies lot lip reading since hearing aids aren’t helpful voice hearing issues. He’s happy everyone around masked keep people safe.  


The inconvenience carrying around notepad open phone app far outweighed benefits. try non customer facing work possible, it’s retail, often it’s unavoidable. amount could accidently fall J.Powell's pockets way restroom. Europe keeps moving towards Swedens strategy scared admit it. loyal pet sticks orange hair master matter badly treats him. Fucking moron live Western Australia. premier closed borders rest Australia world. still getting WA residents coming back must isolate 14 days go homes. haven’t community transmission 6 months, economy extremely well. live almost virus isn’t around. However, dont know long keep up. rest Australia calling us open border. states still community transmission although it’s lot got returned overseas people hotels keeping hygienic practices. 
I wonder every country taken seriously, would pandemic still racing around strongly inevitable? Italy tougher longer lockdown NZ. literally banned people taking walks around block. half country pretty much unaffected virus begin with. Yet still manage reach zero

It enforced. People still went whatever wanted.   seeing 0.01% number? I'm hard time finding anything besides CFR. Looking CDC 0.1% CFR much IFR. 0.01% would imply 90% cases asymptomatic can't find anything saying case. IFR definitely lower CFR found good info anywhere mention might change mind real quick ARDS sets can't breathe. course depends health individual, guess close death may matter much. Covid blows nursing home kill tens people. die alone, horrible slow drowning ICU without family. would ignorant beliefs I’m there, understanding lockdowns US dubious benefit isn’t measures lockdowns actually maintain control numbers. rest Asia barely uses sorts lockdowns, use social distancing contact tracing manage it. course multiple factors. Spain probably second wave. ""surge"" second wave mere fraction experienced first wave (no masks). Look slope daily deaths per capita vs back March/April. comparison.

But keep mind seen massive surges China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea since massively crowded well? time. matter dense there. social distancing possible there. Japan one oldest populations world densest cities world vulnerable Covid19 yet deaths per capita 13 per million vs Sweden's 583 per million. visited Japan, see huge chunk population always wore masks especially news first came China mysterious illness. people end jail.

American lazy think stupid understand basic physics, companies held higher standard comes false claims. need prove claim *before* start advertising, taking money declaring bankruptcy avoid punishment get sued. Good. Living AZ fried extra crispy. Ok head out, every vaccine also get stamp like paid cover club, takes days wash forehead. everybody knows see stamp shouldn’t damn house stay far away That’s 2 2 million plus cases fomites...but means let’s continue scrubbing groceries Clorox 😂 Weird, almost like guys plan MS? always heard medical professional wore shields block potential spray hitting face, mainly eyes. used called New Amsterdam. I'm kind surprised mention comment. 🤷‍♂️ correct,  cannot infect 100% population.

The effective level natural herd immunity bit lower that, could 70% 80%.  still means complete failure precaution, mitigation, containment efforts. means society well bunch cows would. would even assume I'm English teacher?

Hint: I'm not. RemindMe! 6 months Yep, greater population general, difficult control borders.

Like saying, NZ unique coincidentally incredibly well situated enact virus restrictions effectively important really. EU EEA countries works well, see Australia whatever US tells though. It'd like saying Japan raised stink. UK Canada. also hate needles. nauseated anxiety anytime think getting vaccine next year (or whenever it’s available). doesn’t mean I’m 100% getting it. Nobody stopping laughing either. media report people even notice anything wrong Still bringing evidence table, instead resorting particularly unclever sarcasm. I'm shocked. 😂🤣😂  You’re right. folks told work suck wipe groceries nab food bank, it’s small burden... I’m amazed 8 months studying every aspect virus, scientists worldwide still can’t make minds basic characteristics like mode transmission (airborne vs droplets), longevity surfaces, etc. keep getting contradictory information place kind consensus, even cautious one.  Yes certainly do. also see attitudes social media, including Reddit. really problem attitude alone also result disinformation.

One big problem getting patients visitors wear masks. Many take second leave room, every time reenter ask put masks on. shared rooms they're endangering neighbor well everyone else. matter much educate certain patients visitors, think kind ulterior motive asking mask (what motive idk). even worse many cannot grasp simple concept mask protects people. 

And least favorite thing COVID patients' conspiracy theories. one believed COVID hoax til died COVID.

So yes damn right see worst attitudes, attitudes way exclusive hospitalized. know defeating propaganda way beat this. ""building safe capacity"" regulated public safety recommendations depending situation, without ""but muh religion"" override.  countries get inhaled flu shots. people religious festivals services massive part identity. don’t share feelings doesn’t give right tell can’t it.

I'm talking private, personal gatherings like board game nights friends. Religious gatherings festivals need adapt well; sure religions, Bible Torah teach adherents test God. Joe Reddit doesn’t understand 

If it’s meager 1000 day vaccine works 

It’s still 1000 less vectors worry 

Idc number is, neither anyone 

It’s going awhile get everyone ( smart enough ) get one jab inhaler pill... whatever means given one step closer normal 

So Joe Reddit complain left right center rememebr place last December ?... 

The conversation many vaccines dosed instead many vaccines possible Answer : no.  think certainly present stories way aligns way seeing things. 

For example presenting economic relief like unemployment helping need rather boosting economic growth. Raising minimum wage good economic growth, helping poor. 

Universal healthcare like leaving American behind like WW2 Mantra, helping sick. guys want point something here. People need know misinformation looks like. go bottom thread see massively downvoted post guy says someone took vaccine got sick cannot return normal. straight misinformation gives us great example avoid reading websites like Reddit. 

The user conveniently excludes patient could
Have received placebo. first example misinformation 

He goes life cannot go back normal even vaccine. another clear example misinformation. 

I hope everyone see recognize misinformation looks like online. Blame governor unhappy state's mask rules. definitive proof Covid 19 originated China yet. Mexico first case H1N1 mean virus came there. really scientific question better leave science community figure out. course, believe want believe try separate opinions facts. First case HIV came Congo mean need ask Congo reparations every day. “I'm scientist. I'm prime career. another income depend lose marbles.” husband sole income provider recovering long term disability. LOVES work idea taken makes feel sick stomach. Laying low weak, right you. safe protect noggin.  Yeah one made ugly cry inconsolably probably lagging taking precaution vulnerable.  go younger people spread them, go faster younger get control. sis nursing home. old, disabled.  nursing home sends email every week, telling many residents staff positive, suspected, recovered. also tells whether positives house hospital.

I cannot hand anything her, needs left lobby. 

I try go week, cause know likes visits.

I feel like implemented everywhere know isn't. long ample space apart touching. taking away freedom scared little bit trash garden. Yet want freedom murder me.  Lol no. never 😂 wish virus would fuck off. Sad story surprised happening comprehensive plan, thorough implementation, job well done.

From China NZ typical liberal democracy 
society, goes show country beat pandemic regardless government type, science care ideology. country needs creative like this.  economy dying thousand paper cuts right now. everyone would suck pandemic responsible weeks, could get worst get back track lives. already use something like cold flu makes sense since respiratory disease. never go away, unfortunately. spreading misleading garbage. say, ""this coronaviruses work."". implied viruses heterogenous dispersion low attack rates. wrong. surprise push anti-scientific narratives also misinformed ignorant, yet quite willing spread garbage things understand. Keep God's work cause. Fine want Big service. quarantaine church 15 days make sure infection speads outside Oh heck no. Id rather get injection 10 times used get nose flu shot think always made sicker normal shot Heh, weird... 

/s cut one legs give vaccine would get concerts back, I'd it. Misinformation *is* sub section, note evidence comes study:

I'm really curious why? end? half US convinced Trump entire medical community wrapped around finger doctor saying something even remotely positive blackmailed them.

I’m lying, look half comments r/coronavirusUS problem. ad-blocking extensions Firefox? casualty rate directly affected deplorable people spreading disease making excuses lack precautions things like ""I thought said flatten curve"". stupid excuse giving careful. agree this, similar pandemics, it’s two year process......hence end 2021 things get back normal.

Do want sooner, absolutely don’t think that’s realistic.

As well, wouldn’t want see accelerated timeline would put back quarantine again. 400,000 Americans projected dead January, think enough lives sacrifice. Man, long term effects sound brutal... virus politicized like 2 dollar whore train set.... yoga long breathing though? said masks magical. last resort failed stay home failed keeping distance.

Google show people keeping not-more-than-30-cm rule mass kissings weddings (while wearing masks). seems way get decent information people street home actually do.

Just one random picture might give that's spread virus wearing mask. Remember Mathew 4:7. completely desensitized them

That's experience country mandatory mask rules. People socially distance still do. People never still don't. everyone wear masks law. 

I see everyone tries look Sweden example handle pandemic countries (non Asian even) handled far better far better numbers. Perhaps nobody likes lockdown wearing masks.  damage isn’t unique COVID know COVID caused it? 

It’s like lot studies detecting long term heart damage etc appear using subjects average 50+. chances someone 50+ already unnoticed heart damage catch COVID-19? someone hates getting things put nose (the covid swab test one them, horrible) I’m board myself, I’m glad prefer it! 完了，全市600万都要测。全国开始追踪，看来这次动静大了。口罩往后两周又要开始带了。 load mosquitos spray rigs.

TOGETHER!!!!! freedumbbb woooooo I've never seen day old. Would interesting compare Oct 2019 China model fighting pandemic followed. several problems it. 

First reason pandemic spreading worldwide Chinese authoritarianism incompetence. initially tried suppress pandemic cover up. jailed doctors whistleblowers lost vital time trying save face. Furthermore stopped flights Wuhan internally allowed virus spread across world. It’s possible clear transparent governance would pandemic. 

After SARS epidemic 2003 World Health Organization drew list guidelines handling problems. China supposed notify new diseases within 24 hours. Instead failed blow whistle covered pandemic.

Another problem China sealed world time being. going remain closed forever strict entry requirements. pandemic beginning. Corona could circulating forever even vaccine. EXCLUSIVE : Liberal Scientist spraying vaccine mist election polls make Republican men want meth fueled gay sex orgies. 
^j/k ^they ^already ^fantasize ^about ^that Guess it’s awhile since I’ve got vaccine. point is, many people suffer needle phobias. chart clinic go to, list needle fear part health problem Lock inside let eat Jesus crackers. now. expect anti-maskers suddenly turning pro-maskers. going get close even half. takes long get tested get results period tracking gets longer well. eager so? Sorry disappoint, mention race, background ethnicity all. Religion choice, live it.

Did yet find comment follows pattern desired? That’s gonna dawg irresponsible journalism whose purpose polarize support feel lockdowns stupid. saying governments without effective plan control infection choosing go full throttle locking populations primary means virus control. binary protocol effective long run risks lost altogether option population resists repeated lockdowns eventually views ineffective (after all, again? )

Instead governments need emphasize social distancing, washing hands, mask usage nose limit group gatherings  

Also needs learn communicate better headlines generated I'm immune patient told stay away anyone received inhaled flu vaccine, idea inhaled COVID-19 vaccine makes want crawl house stay there. know call Florida gods waiting room. like kept waiting waiting room? Didn’t think so. Agreed. don’t mind lot changes, since weakened immune system, already sanitizer/hand washer &amp; wipe high touch surfaces. way, I’m glad others acting like me. lol  90 three classrooms worth

The teacher got triggered. 

But yeah, they’re freaking majority deaths still, mostly be, someone else zero connection to. 

The way things going, Florida still covid bubble places normalized. cities struggling capacity? can't find any. Getting vaccination different getting blood drawn. barely feel vaccination needle. way, lost control (of contact tracing) like 200 cases day (australia). likely multiple health issues. good side pandemic understanding virology immunology made quantum leap, preventing future infections treat well likely multiple autoimmune diseases. One year deemed highly ineffective next year available. though. Personally would still prefer shot. Actually, multiple churches opened way 30 visitors today.

Not mention chanting advised, yet ...the college football subreddit tearing Dan Mullen new one even suggesting full capacity, Florida fans among vocal it.

Good them. 👍 vegan friendly understand. It’s frustrating redditors seem capable grasping economic nuance beyond “capitalism bad” Fraud, dude. Omg think it’s shock 😂 still hoax!! DONT TELL WEAR MASK!! MAH FREEDOMS!!!! \o/ woooooo wooooo wooooooo 

o.O facepalm situation presents economical political opportunities people power. Money makes world go round, responsibility. would think Microsoft (and companies) would catch on, right?

Salaries heavily tied COL anyway; mean, employee probably changed personal information (which includes physical address HR portal) anyway, right? exploding ever before. that's point, states whatever want. That's good way government set up, listen president unhinged.  Funny three BLM protests went hard see anyone without mask. hundreds people literally can't remember one without. Also people provded one well, water also given out.

But hey ""both sides"". One word. America! Nice hat! dont think u.s Europe wants like china though cases = deaths? i'm confused.   obsession case count whole issue this. Since okay sick? People going sick work/school entire lives. month visit farmer Netherlands buy hay animals. lost 3 brothers summer covid sick himself. age 70, healthy. never ever heard flu deadly impact older people. Homemade masks first presumed little use evaluated whether protected wearing them.

When became evident homemade masks could reduce spread wearing them, guidance changed.

Laypeople misuse medical-grade masks masks encourage overconfidence.  goal use masks keep infected infecting others, perspective different guidance change.

Nuance lost people. also still know long immunity lasts Apparently leaders jobs to....lead ""..., contrast Fauci's initial claims inefficacy masks, inspired anti-mask movement done incalculable harm country arguably world."" Wilson didn’t give fuck American people getting influenza cared American troops started getting ww1.  New Mexico set record yesterday Due reporting cases seemed getting infected within short window obviously inferring got sick around time. everyone got sick together outdoors. work together outside specific event could passed other. However exposure event it’s assumed got event gave event. It’s terrible coincidence happened test positive time frame make meet here. almost like way country governed designed states make laws follow insane president saying... also, metric Florida mess? please elaborate. Let guess, they're hiding numbers... They’re still responsible, don’t make excuses   Yes they’re obviously part conspiracy? Walk idea end street. many people complicit fraud, exactly? cool ‘Who supposed listen to? Every single doctor scientist planet? uncle drinking buddies?’ Precautions far biggest factor Even Canada anti-maskers. boggles mind. I'm ashamed race. Humans smarter this! must work home patient likely die Covid they've treatment diverticulitis years ago? father currently Barrett's syndrome; he's cooped exercising precautions. ...but scenario, person gets COVID die 2X many times (so far counting).

You get that, right? Deaths per million: Texas ranks 18th among states + DC, California ranks 27th.

And Texas first case weeks California, difference even worse suggests. Florida relies sales taxes fund government. state income tax, dependent sales tax revenue. got covid. feels way worse flu. first world country without universal healthcare. shocker people caring others well-being existant US? Right, they'll want change RSVP tentative.  people always compare one thing other?

The worst part studies looking backward - something dynamic COVID that's especially poor.

Truth is, many populations COVID compared diseases. state 14 people die day respiratory disease - COVID. regular population (those without serious existing health problems) dying 1 week COVID.

If course different - time discussed largely respiratory disease especially danger (at like 100X 1000X rate) elderly people serious underlying conditions.

For slight take - public health system tops nation (maybe one best world), 1.8% deaths people without underlying conditions - AND, people probably elderly (avg age 82).

On one hand novel virus. hand, see people wrong side equation - is, acting speaking dangerous general healthy population is. 

1.8% approx 10K deaths would be180 dead 6 month period. 

160 die every day causes - 14 respiratory. 

I'm debating ""side"" here, facts important things. mortality already come approx. ""5X Flu"" want look way. That's high - Ebola death sentence! 95% figure specific measles shouldnt used context. different value different diseases Covid still relatively new exact number still known going corona viruses 60-70% range could even lower. Look numbers. dies. Recent death versus cases numbers. It’s biggest reaction history humanity. deaths Spanish flu occurred secondary bacterial infections, Spanish flu would different occurred today  Dang right shit hole countries

Boy, GOP perfect presidential candidate you! might bit crazy China create said wrong. I’m looking yes no. Shouldn’t difficult know right? See listing stuff one asked blaming time answer “yes” “no”. typed enough time copy paste something stupid, asked yes no. 95% number seems taking specifically WHOs measles control program. Measles much much contagious anything else, R_0 easily double digits. Covid-19, easier spread influenza strains well coronaviruses like MERs SARs, much less contagious that. Less contagious means lower vaccine coverage needed prevent outbreaks. Meth  Lol trying discredit news based people reporting it? Yes understood way you. wonder back-up plans would see numbers like spring. guess region's find measures suits area help FHM. bigger question handle society people follow initial rules. Life sort back normal get people follow measurements.

We still far spring numbers hope stay way used massive anxiety came anything needles, especially blood draws. learned two game-changers doctors nurses almost anxiety get problem.

Unfortunately I'm bit hesitant trust numbers. 


Less 6k reported Covid deaths July, 30k excess deaths. 


The Economist list Russias excess deaths 6 times Covid deaths. 


733 names healthcare workers' memory list. 


If real number deaths 6 times reported, Russia would 135k deaths, 935 deaths per million. Well Belgium. Damn. hoping would legalise snipers dart guns. People *say* they’re ready “normal life” they’re blue face, doesn’t matter much there’s deadly novel pandemic. can’t wish things back way pre-covid. It’s going take time effort, it’s better accept rather deciding things want be. cults hard family Hungary. July 10-15 cases day strict lockdown. August came everyone went August holidays Croatia coastal places. cases back 900/day so. wear masks public transport (I think). 

But, friends mom get virus last month(from work, holiday), police locked checked times day ensure quarantine compliance. Hungary also completely closed borders everyone except transport border workers. don’t scientific evidence, think August holidays something increases across Europe now.

Dammit, people produce FBS mouths noses. Okay, obsession brunch marks torrent alt. stop? make one suppository bc want cum time!!! worked Namibia, able keep virus bay long enough first wave occurring countries second wave. Also there’s lot known virus people getting treated better. March 58 ventilators whole country big wave right away would meant death lot people. Corona doesn’t cause hunger. Lack humanitarian response government failures causes cancer. compare New York? way worse state except Louisiana. Thing is, T-rump voters tasteless already recognize main post-covid symptom :) WRONG. purpose stop spread disease people die. country NI? Trump got them... sigh. what's plan? god come NWO cashless society crazies Hey, issues too.

I recently cognitive behavioral therapy something else, practitioner helped too. phobic like me, works differently phobia.

In general, phobia invoke fight flight responses, spiking blood pressure able things effectively. Blood/needle injury phobia different. body overreacts blood loss event (or thought one); case actual major blood loss event, BP plummet, attempting slow body bleeding out. keep BP elevated artificially flexing large muscle groups body getting blood draw. Thighs, core, biceps: keep 'em clenched. still unpleasant experience, helped loads lightheadedness. Hope helps. Yes, fresh frozen. Australia months second lockdown, virus still kicking. way much populated integrated European countries same. like offer viable alternative. Contact tracing absolutely work United States. People willing make sacrifices protect lives others. can't even get large percentage American people wear masks. harm done tourism, understand lot developing nations whose economies rely heavily tourism, imagine impact disease could potentially curbs put place. psychological issues associated lockdowns, effort resources put improving access mental health. lot people, especially people developed world, lack coping mechanisms resiliency. Minor inconveniences send deep pits despair. decadence made us weak. Wrong question. right question is, get deplorables cooperate?

The lockdown work deplorables cooperate. End story. cooperated, maybe would worked, that's way is. Cases surging Germany Spain recently lowered. 
But anyways still masks place months months ... cause effect obviously recommend banking soda vinegar instead...  Well fair kind annoying every post sub US slightest, still half comments somehow US  possible happens people, certainly common anywhere near 10% Yea, one virologist said need like 100 infected people coughing small area anything you. even that, wash hands touching packaging, irrelevant anyways. Sarcasm assume? better not. cant handle another lockdown. supplementing vitamin important also take vitamin K2 (about 180mcg per day MK-7 often recommended).

Vitamin increases calcium absorption. without enough vitamin K2 (MK-7) excess  calcium deposited vascular tissues instead bones, increasing risk arterial calcification hypertension.

See instance info important add K2 supplementing Vitamin D.  cover up.

This factually incorrect. Even believe virus completely natural origin, coverups multiple levels led delayed international response. example: Many people work live different countries. pretty horrible way die clean groceries - packaged things soap produce vinegar - yes no?! Cases ""surging"" Spain Germany. 

Italy France? Yeah, they've got problem. Unfortunately, people also cherry pick data find one statistic ignoring everything else. Like CFR IFR.

Yes, IFR great, also crazy high. statistically kills like lot viruses, weakened elderly. Nearly everyone catches survive. people say live normally, mitigation waste.

Of course, that's entire story. Sure, people live rather large percentage infected require hospital care, crazy contagious. ""letting rip"" would cause overwhelmed hospitals like we've seen NY, Texas places. mention supply chain breakdowns, among problems. People can't manufacture, distribute, stock, etc. they're sick time. That's even get long term health issues, cost cause.

Remember people decried China's methods inhumane everyone changed minds suddenly, places like SK Taiwan forgotten?

Pepperidge Farm remembers. know works, know other, better long-term options besides lockdowns refuse implement seriously. Nope, I’m certainly nailing hot Facebook mommies week looking pure science juice next child. It’s great couple weeks. actual health expert: stop locking Random redditor: misguided dangerous!!1!

You proving point: thing Joe Average get ""WHO official says Lockdown"". listen interview ar read say lockdowns stop. problem overestimating people. easy do, fact almost impossible underestimate people. People want cooperate, people want use masks, people want adhere social distancing, people want to, can't afford to, stay home sick. I’m interested seeing way would used. mother, severe asthma ground glass nodules lungs told can’t use types vaccines trigger? relevant? 
What special Melbourne boring Riga?  said, shall see pans out. try read experts, some. still plenty experts concerned effect lockdowns. business “restricted” providing feeding family...there, fixed it. ones NYC get crowded. Matthew 18:20 also seems particularly relevant here. Here’s hate articles, even comments experts, we’ll masking social distancing time come 

Notice there’s never estimated timeline. long “some time come”? June? Yeah deal that. sucks, least know reason we’re making decision - wait vaccine available want it. It’s vague statement meant spread fear. things get back normal won’t normal we’re used to.

Again, line meant scare public. experts clear want taken seriously. Give examples, let public decide going agree moving forward direction not.

Someone another comment said it, agree. point it’s news outlets trying scare public click bait articles. Even Fauci said “things probably get back normal used end Q3, early Q4 2021. Media outlets spun “Fauci says return normal anytime soon”. Q3 2021? That’s tolerable public. Lockdowns going norm long massive spikes keep happening people irrational, unreasonable, selfish. want lockdowns stop? Figure get people compliant.

If there's one thing pandemic taught us, real outbreak fucking stupid everyone is. like we're movie Contagion catch thing way die within 3 days effective treatments ways prevent spread. Straight scientists, trust, came said ""Hey, wash hands, stay away people, wear mask.""

And response ""Excuse want wear muzzle? Wash hands? Stop spraying mouth drops everyone scream free country? That's basically slavery get fucked. Good day dare you.""

Take antiscience bullshit elsewhere 

liberals: Follow science! 
WHO: lockdowns harm good, solid data showing masks really help either. oh mortality rate .6%(average age death 82) sorry scaring everyone 
liberals: SCIENCE How’s outdoor dining looking winter NYC? Lol Don’t worry, hang science denying Christian friends. don’t discriminate comes science deniers. suggest looking past headline course reading article. Actually, suggest reading beyond article going directly video watching that; direct information proverbial horse's mouth. Lock abusers let marijuana smokers out. That's be.

And yeah, made poor, it. many people shit earn anything want live neighborhood doctors engineers. I'm supposed feel bad can't afford mansion McDonald's worker salary? I'm supposed help keep shit could never afford moment lose paychecks? No. learn budget, like me. plenty empathy. ends lazy stupid people come beg I've worked for. simple analysis possible ppl like you, read shit can't parse data properly.

An ad hominem attack definitely crosses line, simple number calculate...

I think agree even premise numeric alone stand valid complete layer policy making analysis. Compared cardiovascular diseases, far fewer people die murder. fires. divorce disputes. organised crime. robbery. terrorism. war. natural disasters. None stops us pouring huge amounts money resources building extensive societal structures around issues, often inconveniencing people quite bit. surely disagree murdering 85-year old prisoner legally executed next hour murder.

Also, neither red meat sugar infectious capable uncontrolled contagion. heard thing superspreaders these.

Last, couple numerical 80 year olds dead, going spend 10 trillion combat 80 year olds dead. seem recall someone harshly accusing another simple data inaccuracies point ad hominem, nevermind me.

Also, *dead* past participle. *going to* grammatical construction expressing future. Surely internal logic seems bit insufficiently solidly founded. Nevermind Fed decided spend overwhelming majority trillions *unlimited* liquidity supporting market. also strong doubts citing quite intentional governmental incompetence evidence discussion sorts actions *ought* (not) betaken. way predict circle jerk assholes using comment comments like poke fun ""liberal arts majors"" ""leftists"" ""manipulating science"" bullshi--oh whoops I'm already late lmao. moment Karen finally wears mask Belgium stupid. 25% region votes party dont believen masks lockdown. 6k cases day doubling every 8 days.

Basically, concerns always met responses ""well, primary way spreads.""

That's question. doubt, less risky inhaling people's sneezes bar. Far, far less so, even. 

But without risk, there's little downside time energy wipe groceries wash hands. great burden, like able go work make living, even able go see movie, low risk might worth it. talking wiping groceries washing hands here.

Heck, least wash rat piss groceries nothing else. something recommended, needed used number countries outbreaks growing quickly,” Dr Van Kerkhove said. “But we’re hopeful countries need implement national lockdowns again.”

From WHO. doctor went recommend combination localized shutdowns, health services, distancing, masks. 

Nobody recommending shutdowns primary solution. spray microchips Nordic model underpinned mixed-market capitalist economic system features high degrees private ownership,[37] exception Norway includes large number state-owned enterprises state ownership publicly listed Nordic model described system competitive capitalism combined large percentage population employed public sector (roughly 30% work force).[5]

[...] 1990s, Swedish economy pursued neoliberal reforms[41][42] reduced role public sector, leading fastest growth inequality OECD economy.[43] However, Sweden's income inequality still remains lower countries.[44] per WHO’s guidance, it’s control like stated Argentina, guidance still lockdown based statement. Utterly incorrect. whole “if Karen wore mask” thing fallacy.

The Philippines brutally enforcing masks outside home since April- police AK47s every corner ensure followed. (This top nobody 60 21 allowed leave home *at all*) take peep case numbers.... Probably is, good point “racism” “discrimination” anyone need to. saying isn’t tend back get targeted called racist, anti Semitic..etcy  lived 3 years foreigner. church-goer (int'l church). meet anyone said attended church see town active church community. could missed one town. suppose. feel like im going pass skin feels loke comming sheets rest day needle. Ill take snotty nose that. employees don’t choice. employers tell start working don’t show up, get fired showing (has happen times legally get fired, though) 
If get fired showing up, tough shit, unemployment benefits waiting them. 

Also, measure isn’t permanent. industry, hospitality, generous help State industries, example. Admirable confidence. Probably makes side likely win! Keep up. You’d rather live dictatorship slowed covid free country? since beginning actually happening. lot uneducated Facebook mommies really confused today, they’ve already reached proper understanding. see everything black white, everything short anarchy lockdown Sure:

You partly right. new things: 

•	⁠A strong reminder recommendation work home possible. enforcing whole public sector. (This recommendation always there, went fashion pretty quickly opened may).

•	⁠Not allowing bars restaurants open late.

•	⁠No public gatherings 50 people. (Down 500 believe). 

•	⁠Mask use bars restaurants seated.

And whole test strategy something scaled reinforced specific regions according current needs. 

Personally wouldn’t minded slightly tougher hammer beat rather stabilising it. think hope achieve even better testing contact tracing: 

A new test strategy announced days ago prepare us winter. main change capacity enlarged 70-80.000 tests per day (now it’s 50.000) 100.000 tests per day really needed. also proactive mobile, easily quickly available quicker answers better fast track special groups needs it. lockdowns? followers ignoring protocol thats one thing would much better way. problem is, unfortunately ( want yank hair out) anti (or lack regard for) science sentiment coming large swath non T-supporters. It’s horrifying. honestly think Trump everything right, bozos would still are. Even mask mandate, would see decrease people behavior, would still ton rule breakers... Would really weird blame diseases US since there's definitive proof came US.

No one sure Spanish flu came from.

HIV originated Democratic Republic Congo.

The first H1N1 cases backdated Mexico. least it’ll get wear masks!

(In fact, let’s aerosolize vaccine spray everywhere. Checkmate!) equivalent US reporting 67,000 cases. Sunday too, usually slow.  dark room ideal conditions virus stay alive surface. guess so! seems like would help situations someone sneezed directly face sneezed hard would go visor. Americans want doctors specialists telling anything smart people make Americans feel insecure. True, remember NZ zero community transmission gone elimination strategy countries haven't. them, little things matter seed larger outbreaks. 

For rest Western wastelands, matter. Even dozens infected every day via contaminated surfaces, probably epidemiological irrelevant countries detecting tens thousands cases infected via aerosols. 

Washing hands often good practice, going save going restaurants bars every day. know people obsessed hand disinfectant, hardly take precaution. People lamenting COVID19 second coming black plague bad honest. Really? 2 days many people die flu one day coronA.. government tells thats effective buy model requires low infection rates practicable. point, reaching requires absolutely nuking economy. (Europe) almost got rates low enough fucked afterwards, third opportunity without breaking everything. try flu vaccine years ago really sucked stopped administering way? people actually end lives though want see loved ones possibly last time. I've thought nasal spray might effective while. vaccine additional preventative measure like hand sanitising. Vicks First Defence effective stopping cold taking firm hold - nasal spray defeating coronavirus. Australia one. PRC slapped economic sanctions daring step line. speak sanely first paragraph devulge “all live like hermit”. inject zinc!!!!!!! So, little additional background former Army medical officer (and working vaccine development), name game call ""cold-chain."" That's logistics getting vaccine factory end user maintaining proper environment... proper temperature, storage, etc. holy grail self-stable, thermo-stabilized inoculations... tell isn't. Yes, true nasal inhaled vaccines ideal site administration. solve real problem, logistics storage movement. Wendover Productions really good job explaining high level details hard task is.

What interesting however, proposition concomitant therapy along influenza. would incredibly useful. \- Close international borders

\- mandates gatherings shame people needing socialization (small gatherings fine, big parties fine)

\- Mask mandates

\- Make PPE home instead relying countries

\- Make COVID isolation wards decrease chances spread home regular hospitals

\- Encourage people spend time outdoors shame (remember calling beachgoers ""grandma killers?"")

\- Close interstate borders necessary

\- Develop efficient contact tracing system (UK, I'm looking you)

\- Test proactively efficiently (No one waiting 24-48 hours results)

\- Pay people take time they've exposed they're isolation

\- Keep places can't function without distancing (fight clubs, dive bars, restaurants need indoor dining) closed cases extremely low well managed

\- Focus stopping outbreaks clusters (i.e. White House superspreader event), untraceable cases, instead cases alone (i.e. ""Casedemic"", cases tell much)

\- Look EVERYTHING successful countries use methods instead looking one aspect strategy (lockdown, mask mandates, distancing, etc.) Well, mean offend you, apologize. According 2018 poll Pew Research, respected think tank, 9% Dutch people 40 attend church regularly; 40 13% attend regularly. among lowest church-going population world. town lived in, cannot recall working church. Dutch friends thought slightly odd going church week, experience.

Ik heb wel Nederlands geleerd. Mijn kinderen werden vloeiend Nederlands.
Ik ben dol op Nederland! “10% more” bro make data. 
The IFR less 1% stop saying it’s 2% point, I'd let Mike Tyson punch balls fist vaccine it. 

and temperature least 140 degrees. no, guys going that.

how ineffective masks? read actual study, even used correctly talking 16% reduction risk infection wear one properly every day 30 days. know people want that's enough stop contagious upper respiratory infection, slow little bit. herd immunity strategy, inevitability.

never thankful live small town, even servers cashiers often participate political virtue signaling. number people know covid-19 14, every single one fine week. person know died older relative. ever contract covid 19, fell injured therapy delayed bc lockdowns, died weeks later hospital bed unable move last several days Absolutely, idea downvoted. downvoters: rename sub r/Bedwetters. got lost park medication-induced brain fog. would terrified mind depressed mind time.

Who they? depends nuts misinformation peddler is. could lizard people, illuminati, globalists, Rothchild's, Soros, Satan worshipers, mainstream media Gates foundation... sure made issue impacting US. Well believe vaccines bad chemicals whatever think there, applies nasal vaccine. hard take discussion seriously people argue bad faith actors.

The Great Barrington Declaration scam article uses legitimate resource.

You also provide evidence links information support deaths lockdowns cause 10x deaths COVID-19. 

The article argues official think lockdowns *PRIMARY* control mechanism. agree statement. 

And US, UK, Brazil, Russia, competent dealing reality rather denying lockdowns would likely effective like NZ, South Korea, Singapore etc.

But unfortunately right leaning Governments world shit bed comes Coronavirus.

That makes really hard believe try pivot make argument really *care* lives *genuine concern* health citizens arguing months ago sacrifice grandparents economy saying Covid-19 hoax, selling millions stock intelligence briefing continued publicly downplay severity virus.

They lied masks knew short medical industry.  ask people make own...

You're probably right washing food, could easily give us alternatives.  

I think they've taken bad approach.  lie public, getting trust back take decades.... never wash mine works fine. go grocery stores, restaurants, crowded boardwalks, etc. Works great Homicidal maniacs taking stroll around block 😂 😂 😂 vaccine going prevent covid. might decent chance still get considering infectious is. Viruses weaken they're contagious way, asymptomatic people likely spread them. one already capable that, 60% infections pre-symptomatic people. also mild children yound people, main spreaders viruses. So, I'm sure virus reason weaken significantly time. mutates slowly, good vaccines, bad natural weakening. would anyone want work get 10% more? I'm talking global scale. Hamster injected HCQ placed appropriately red hat man glorious thing.. best treatment. could get “inside body”. “We must bit stricter places infection chains spread mostly, parties and, unfortunately, also travel,” chancellor’s chief staff, Helge Braun, told public broadcaster ARD.

“We beginning second wave politicians’ population’s determination decide whether avoid it, slow down,” added.

------

Merkel mayors Germany’s 11 largest cities agreed Friday adopt stricter measures infections exceed threshold 50 cases per 100,000 population week.

More 20 cities level, caused patchwork internal travel restrictions.

Braun, medical doctor, said test centres prioritise health sector workers people showing symptoms tourists.

Holidaymakers circumvent local travel curbs produce negative test results.


Bavaria’s prime minister, Markus Soeder, weekend proposed steeper fines people wearing masks mandated places public transport shops -- 250 euros ($295.60) compared current 50 euros, 500 euros repeat offenders. 16% reduction wearing mask all? Sounds fine me. couldn’t even recall “toothbrush,” saying friend “‘You know, thing makes teeth clean.’”

My mother talks like now. got COVID back June sick enough hospitalized week. managed bounce back August seems good spirits now. whenever talk her, say stuff exactly like quote even skip beat. help find words without making big deal it, want make feel bad. concerns whole lot. year ago could go weeks without talking mother. call multiple times week make sure gets intellectual stimulation see brain gotten worse last time talked. know I'm this. thinks I'm calling say hey.

And I'm terrified getting COVID. I'm scientist. I'm prime career. another income depend lose marbles. already brain challenges me, someone suffers Tourette's syndrome dyspraxia.  Even neurological injury COVID common, know there's good chance vurnerability.

So I'm going keep laying low ignore people think laying low weak. Well would push vaccine-dummies get it. top immunocompromised people would completely depend everyone follow quarantine rules. killed, killing, kill ... people emotionally invested believing misinformation. grabbed coffee real life would agree. Real life conversations going well. need reach people. 
Thanks reddit! Mine 22 tested last day work closed. Spent 12 weeks weekly 50000IU (plus daily multi vitamin 1000IU) got 40. doc told maintain 1000IU. still may end getting tested stay top this, work school I'm terrified holidays families disregard everything get together anyway. can't play rules nasty asshole. Noted. Post conservative again, change world. lol Dipshit. kminder 5 days ""is gone yet? lol""

Maybe answer this, seeing Swedish fuckbag accounts? Vietnam isn’t landlocked. Taiwan enormous population island. UK. 

It’s part equation government response cooperation general population makes breaks COVID success strategy. 

Population size border controls factors success. third covid deaths U.K. Alzheimer’s dementia. 
If me, father grandmother I’d rather die covid rot brain deterioration years. said lockdowns....didn’t Merkel get memo? /s favor look ""happy hypoxia"", one silent possible deadly symptoms virus. terms particular virus, absolutely could feeling ""fine"" take sudden turn worst matter day two. Yes, numbers going stop. Like said France “nous sommes dans la merde jusqu’au cou” cathartic read lol. I've saying months kept getting downvoted. 

People firmly camps, though. doubt they'll change outlook even World Health Organization says so. Says 😉 says shutdown isn’t answer...gotta follow science, right?! females males US..... Lolol well least we’re using science make decisions overly dramatic anecdotes.

You sure copters weren’t filming protests? So... mobile respiratory droplet turret? problem North England, don’t know figures tell story. Even quick glance [the map gives indication going wrong us. Got get info Facebook mommies, stat! write angsty opinions internet one listens real life? Interesting post taken misinformation yet gives shit? make new account, cucks like give shit.

Social conservatism plague. downplaying virus, tell idiots. defending spreading disinformation. Yeah think least try to. Start testing, posting, tracking daily flu counts sub eradicate it. might well knock 2 viruses one stone, say. insurance paid it?

The healthcare system US ranked like 38th WHO. level care, also access cost. included. Reddit's favorite son, Canada, ranked 30th. difference really much, website loves shit one crow bizarre.   key statements predications. predications happened didn't. able buy way lockdown. Bezos Zuckerman grease right palms. worry, dissappear like miracle.... day now.... Nope. Literally one proposed use actually used “primary control measures”. used trajectory makes clearly inevitable hospitals overwhelmed, “flatten curve” buy time healthcare able handle cases also learn treat new disease dramatically helps death rates (which case loads spring, death rates much lower). Good bad government is. discipline people discipline too. much culturally difference paid off. listen to.

US CDC - flip flops aerosols? 

Those dispute HCQ+Zinc+AZT..despite countries doctors using it. Like UAE - low death rate despite high infections.

Calif. doctor successfully cures 1,700 COVID-19 pharma..who tell vaccines work obese / elderly? 2 primary ""vulnerable"" groups. Nevermind vulnerable groups include young LONG Pharma Moderna - insiders made huge stock profits on.

Tech companies censor?

Mask fanatics despite Scandinavia using masks part pro-mask folks realize downsides. levels ""gone down"" many places mandated - see Israel example.

Taiwan CDC? Note part Taiwan testing CT one. take data points. see world differently. understand people losing valuable experiences, one people. also can’t speak situation Australia, I’m US Florida. situation way people behaving right dumb instances. don’t fines place, also many people simply won’t put mask, simplest thing people still cannot that. power COVID-19 positive thinking. Harleys sale! two accounts? Seems banworthy.

u/EaglesNumberOne u/EaglesNumberTwo. post exclusively coronavirus. Separate conversations allow hypocrites blame side today, defend leaders lies tomorrow. Good observation. Texas border New Mexico mask free zone. beside lockdowns? Right - Trump federal judge determination won’t stand way future necessary precautions, main concern. Especially since shutdowns managed properly seem way truly end transmission. France cases per capita [Here’s page links opinions expressed Dr. Special Envoy quoted story, gives balanced picture views fighting COVID doesn’t focus anti-lockdown aspect.  total population 83 million people, packed country half size Texas?

Now could convince shit heads around inviting 300 people no-mask wedding party good idea? would lot better off.

The big problem meat packing industry, hundreds workers least dozen factories got virus time.

On surface look great fact accurate, non-political transparent reporting helps awful lot. Please note Florida report yesterday. today's report **two days**. imo nothing special compared two days ago. comment helpful? ~~What trucks event?~~

Ahh ok, Bergamo referring transporting bodies. head associating coffins trucks took click together me. Especially real-life pandemic drags forever. remember getting too. Honestly vile. prefer getting shot. people liked better though Well that’s fucked up. burn place ground then.  possible American public stupid noncompliant go along it. nursing home residents **PCPJ: Pentecostals &amp; Charismatics Peace &amp; Justice**

Sounds like article written means get donations. Maryland. May ask. feel? nasal flu shot? thought highly vaporized like breathing steam. never know. Still better many places spent tax dollars... many current cabinet officials pocketed PPP funds.

Emergency medical funding used take ads bring tourists pandemic comes mind. brain fog side effect meds. Scary. Got lost house. find kitchen. Never want go again. want people die? terrible person. said: right now, there's way, best. call **quarantine**, biking, queuing... self isolated. I'm pedantic probably, pandemic lack resources overwhelmed health services, we're demoting services language. we're experiencing like using carrier pigeon calling ultra-broadband messaging. 

In normal times, somebody suspected highly infectious airborne deadly disease allowed go bike ride... twice. Somebody would come door hazmat, bring food test kit even open door time takes make sure ok. That's quarantine. That's countries took disease seriously back january doing. Countries whose president went elderly wife theater March assure People life goes on... well... countries wait 16 days results call mass testing. vitamin 15. PCP suggested hundred iu per day. Endocrinologist suggested 3,000. Dietitian suggested occasional 5,000. 

After year taking 3,000 daily average, vitamin finally 30. 

Sadly, crap symptoms lol. Glad got pandemic though! locked March. took long time get referrals, condition seen priority. might one silliest things I've read sub, that's saying something considering fact ton anti-maskers post here. thought Swedes trusted government could trusted follow recommendations?

You mean tell FHM introduces recommendation wear mask, Swedish people can't trusted continue following recommendations? can’t according laws. state can’t even enter church NL. hospitalizations deaths.

Well coming ""cold/flu"" season could expect hospitalizations deaths go *somewhat* summer. indeed seeing.

And seems (at least am) asked asymptomatic people go get tested order combat lineups testing facilities. symptomatic people going going see rise positivity rate, no?  federal government botched testing let spread silently vulnerable populations, simultaneously pretending virus contained downplaying dangers spite knowing much worse flu possibly airborne. I'd say always. spash vinegar water hurt. military back in... 05? given nasal one. squirt nose runs back throat. get feeling water nose annoying taste trickles down. *probably* sore throat/nasal issues days.

Honestly I'd rather get needle. Call surprised. It’s like playing idiot whack mole C0Nservatives. Deep  even see fuzz around without masks. happens.
Priapism called. Thanks god, I’m deathly terrified needles lost shit doctor didn’t flu mist spray anymore. We’ve using old, dried wet wipes doused rubbing alcohol wipe packaged goods, soap/water produce since March. far good. knew waiting till 4th grade drop right call. Wrong state feel opposite lesson learned 1000 people moving every day. sad many stories like one! I’ll try keep updated. right it’s gone ~400 per week 6500 infections day less 2 months people taking less less seriously. Also like 3 deaths per week ~17 day hospitals stopping non-corona care. Stroke? Sucks you. Heart attack? got space. Frequent tonsil infections you’ve waiting surgery 3 years now? It’s fine, don’t believe complications illnesses anyway even though you’re you’re 20s already infection spread heart, it’s ok it’s real wait another year.

I think actually called ""accurately calculating IFR"", opposed ""a mathematical trick"". I'm confused would say probably caused COVID said lost hearing **to virus**. Many viruses this, know COVID bunch crazy things. odds someone otherwise normal hearing developing rapid permanent hearing loss one year would pretty infinitesimal. Hearing loss due virus tends gradual age-related loss ears, could occur rapidly due extreme noise exposure (which would still probably ears) due ototoxic medications like chemo drugs. Unless woman cancer recently explosion, I'm guessing COVID far likely reason. Playing lives people too. sorry reddit, agree liberal fringe groups.

I mean virus originated US ENTIRE world would gang sue demand reparations next 50 years US horrible monster careless caused severe harm felt generations, since China we're gonna ignore get angry accused double standard...

This level anti-privacy contact tracing fly West, New Zealand model palatable, even that, golden opportunity already passed, people's confidence level government longer high enough adhere measures required. dunno I've seen Thing. Americans flyover country live knew China locking apartment buildings slow spread Covid back several months ago. knew Covid-19 U.S.


American leadership purposefully lying Covid-19, claiming would disappear Easter like miracle, wants act like flu, can't even promote masks. want continually claim China lied let Covid-19 spread worldwide.


Despite knowing better, American leadership continues game plan 7 months ago. apparently game plan nothing China lieing. Covid-19 disappeared. American leadership even keep leader safe nothing plan.



Covid-19 affecting G7 nations Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, since February 2020.


So worried China's Covid-19 science there's several countries confirm with. I'd suggest ignoring Americans anti-science leadership. love comment, spot almost identical feel well. Science science. matter Chinese not. ppl charge....some useless. I’m listening Dr Fauci point, he’s one telling like now!! \+1 Reported misinformation.  said. also claimed tall skinny. 24.1%

And visiting public restroom long time now, never fan. Word wise: Read outlet (Byline Times) something like leftwing version National Enquirer one British tabloids. seeing loads stuff like served coming months, started ""investigative"" arm. They're relatively new monthly ""news"" outlet founded run journalists leftist movie-industry types, particular story written well known conspiracy mongerer none Christopher Hitchens written extensively. **For entertainment value only.** vegans use medicine medical treatment? feel like going outside realm standard definition veganism. nasal mist used without hen eggs.

Everything shipped. Can't go detail. vaccine ends needing multiple doses maybe initial shot nasal after? faster acting nasal first boosters? least reasonably effective enough people take properly, don’t care taken. (And needle fan) Great. immunocompromised usually can't used inhaled vaccines, need addressed. kill food? Given utterly disastrous they've terms deaths, especially spring, I'm really surprised. Sadly lot running minimal staff really can't support anything additional full lockdown easier-I know LTC infection preventionists normally cover multiple facilities, tough even outside pandemic WILD right now.

That's example against, going immune life get disease going immune months exactly many varies person person. Don’t think I’ve touched physical money year understand everyone luxury contactless credit card. 

The amount banknotes shop owners poorer countries touch daily really scary. Exactly right. gotten point feel like combating misinformation online patriotic duty show every day argue guys. Want pandemic denier Reddit? Plan getting trolled hard account. Plan told self-serving, unpatriotic person are, perhaps adjectives. troll instincts carried me, I'll duration. instructive anecdotes. Anybody want hear psychologists Nuremberg? I'll tell said, applies you. eat lot foods contain magnesium like bananas, whole grains, tuna, leafy greens, potatoes, milk, yogurt. say eat lot mean basically entire diet. I'm suffering hyperkinetic gallbladder going long get out. I'm managing pain symptoms diet mean time. 

I'm wondering still taking magnesium along vitamin d? told doctor GP also educated comes nutrition. 

Google helpful either. thinking I'm consuming recommended daily value need supplement. seeing GI end November definitely ask then. least among certain media outlets, I've noticed recently transitioned ""not big deal"" ""a terrible disease"" discussing certain event, maybe change response...but seem past certain event, might become big deal again. get annoyed get flu shot reports come like ""the flu vaccine might working well"". Like itd better work go yearlong emotional trauma it... Also common form Magnesium supplements — magnesium oxide — isn’t bioavailable whatsoever. want chelated magnesium, magnesium glycinate magnesium citrate (the former favorite).

*disclaimer — comment medical advice, Im saying form Mg bioavailable* I’m lucky live UK don’t get flu shots haha think glad rest life her. know am. mom passed grateful times able care her. vague “oh, might long time normal ... maybe never” statements disingenuous don’t help build trust community.

I know aware this, equal root distrust government *no* predictions *wrong* predictions.

Yes, get it. novel virus, Yadda Yadda Yadda. learn potential every day, on. given developing nature pandemic, think little information much?

I guess depends, boils specific topic timeline. seems might right. Avoiding specific dates favor broader health metrics would better *lockdown* timelines, clear yet flexible timeline described better *vaccine* timelines. going vary individual many factors including ethnicity, genetics, weight, sub exposure, geographic location. take 6,000 IU day, alongside K2, magnesium hide sun recent serum level 43 ng/ml. different reason. still lot account for, pandemic response large scale impressive pull off. People tend accept reject message based upon *who* expressing it. content usually secondary.

One reason Democrats often struggle win elections convinced must persuade opposition, even though can't. Found neckbeard. usually means existence measles violate that. study logical force, pretty useful. Give Dr. Ashley Bloomfield team love please, Jacinda 'front-person'. suggest people do? Vote out? Working it. Side note - people uniformly tend hate congress, love particular congresspeople. Okay says armchair epidemiologist lmao. chatting shit. 

This says use primary way fight it. sentiment echoed epidemiologists since beginning. Track trace ought primary way fighting this, seen places like SK. way allows vulnerable sick potentially sick isolated, whilst overly damaging economy etc. gets far reaching lockdown would best bet. 

By saying act proactively reactively sounds like watch Dr Campbell's videos can't comprehend message. Especially can't understand article, comment implying.

Also apocalyptic scenario? Lmao sit laddie, far worse ""apocalyptic"" events past 100 years this. shite could far worse, lucky pandemic sub 1% fatality rate, talk nonsense apocalypse. happen I'm teen guess they're used little kids freaking out. family tries guilt freaking (""see, little brother fine! baby) just... hate it. hate everything it. least favorite part pandemic thought need get shot end. posts need stay people know misinformation looks like “Until vaccine” worst argument nobody knows real timeline vaccine. citizens accept abuse? really don’t know I’ve never gone looking it, mom know she’s Facebook lot. think probably Facebook groups serve echo chamber. yeah really don’t get otherwise intelligent people fall crap either.. makes cringe every time hear shit...and embarrassed them. What's difference people 90+ 70-89?

They've infected significantly higher numbers consistently. explanation comes about? Fuck everyone living within means, paycheck-to-paycheck gluttons gotta party! coming say this, live flu spray vaccine makes shed flu two weeks. would shedding coronavirus? don’t know vaccine going give better better outcome virus? think know answer that. Basically, unless it’s unsafe someone get vaccine, choose to, think they’re terrible person. lost family members virus, people make choice put elderly mother, immunocompromised friend risk terrible human beings, truly hope legislation passed protect disgustingly selfish people world. I’m done talking this. Enjoy world, thanks letting us live it. draconian government employs draconian measures. fighting virus right origin. democracy knew needs shut travel early mass testing, contact tracing, mask wearing would’ve resulted success. cousin tells shut up. quite like Swedish approach live here, mind elaborating mean? We've pretty consistent start far I'm aware. Ban coming 3...2... weirdo likes watch needle go in? love blood draws. almost feel good, also like needles. face piercings love tattoos. 

No idea why. One things surprised whole coronavirus epidemic many people take vitamins.

I've always taken general multi-vitamin. US, big brands Centrum One Day, plus generic equivalents. General multivitamins 1000 IU vitamin 100mg magnesium. levels based idea get additional vitamins food sunshine. Keep borders closed forever. don’t disagree NZ advantages risk saying we’re special case implies form inevitability elsewhere. 

China, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam plenty countries much better responses Covid countries like America, UK, Brazil. 

The response makes breaks pandemic rather geography. Inept government response costing thousands lives. Huh, kinda does, wow. uhh, ok, nuts. 

I hope get help. soon.

Edit: listen, that's nice me, saying people lose jobs wiped groceries. Plus bunch strange nonsense. saying makes sense. really bizarre. Welp, time lock surfaces 28 days literally panic whenever think them. year dread day get flu shot. Aaaaa hate em Would rather stricter lockdown? thanks, People given point. Bible Belt europe? Really??? people enough hold government accountable this.

No one involved innocent here. Somebody understands excess deaths works people don’t get it.

I feel like misleading statement goes blatantly known science. I’m bit surprised comment sat day undisputed.

“Most people don’t get [SARS-CoV-2.] Yeah... factual statement. Keep mind IFR rises end sometimes longer getting new cases current cases final outcome (death vs recovery). beena huge source misinformation.

""X country reporting real numbers, actually great"" restrictions relax numbers go ""how could happened?"" need new word, people hear ""neo liberal"" hear ""liberal"", person probably thought agreeing them. “...he asked scrubbing box cheez-its, tin foil hat akimbo.”  Yeah, would ever imagine party propagating disinformation middle sever pandemic? think term this... Americans tell founding mission freedom escape persecution, like Facebook, that’s PR spin.

The reality suffered religious persecution amicable employment company sending unexplored lands. look Plymouth Company, realize Puritans refugees staying Netherlands exiled England. Joining Plymouth Company (which people would want do) way restoring citizenship, sort of. deal king made real mission bring people together one place investors could get rich labor.

The real mission get financing way investments endeavors focus long-term outlook could achieved. 
By granting defined mercantile monopoly perpetuity access nascent stock market's financing investors across country, could justify financing ports along African coast way India. Otherwise, there's way hell family business would able access sufficient financing and, even could, could take massive risks and, even could, would remain long-term oriented enough justify expenditures returns ranging 20-30 years.

In case corporations, colonists employees consumers still trading goods currency home charter grants monopoly. U.S. government called puppet China withdrew from... So, logically consistent here, American Right dismissing Chinese ploy spread disease throughout rest world? 🤔 Yeah might die cross road. stories mean little  6 millon Jews exterminated Germany. scared death needles got real excited talking patch thing, nothing came that, really truly hope works. already know rolling dice looks like. Every state run C0NServatives. good convince antivaxers virus exists... one said forever. Calling concentration camp huge insult Jews. believe know much that. many months say this? Florida well known cooking books. unless you’re wearing ~~N95~~ ***a properly fitting mask*** breathe air flow side.

Fixed you. also assumes news organizations would propagate disinformation pandemic. know long immunity lasts permanent. Yeah see happening. act like every case super spreader safe, roll dice :( think helpful know arrived decision. people say ""I'm right, deal it!"" sometimes looks like know themselves... example reasoning is: ""I really want people die saves lives, therefore enforced even though might unpredictable consequences. None could worth life lost"", here's another one: ""I fucking hate Trump, whatever opposes automatically promote!"". 

Often people act like obvious, guarantee everyone thinks differently, probably arrived conclusions different way, even conclusion appears similar. tons magical artifacts let people carbon date anymore. good though less half people get it? UK said vaccine induced herd immunity even goal. talk someone r/coronavirus claiming masks hoax? 🤔 clean underwear?

Fixed you. Normal phone calls inexplicably stopped working mobile month ago (everything else still works though). I’ve relieved stop getting **relentless** spam robocalls haven’t bothered fix yet. I’ve always careful avoid giving 14 year-old phone number, spam calls really spiked around time. Dear leader clueless. Props you. work people can’t bothered wear mask matter what. would also suggest looking comfortable masks. actual mask wear make huge difference comfort long periods time. know asking for?

It's one thing even float idea covid based travel bubble. New Zealand still comfortable opening considering Taiwan, Australia, etc..

But would need demand thing flu. gonna happen.

Unless idea cast New Zealand permanent isolation zone. that's impossible. Obviously happened really sad, happen ways. Due lock downs people working home, noticed significant drop deaths due car accidents accident based causes. Also drop deaths due infectious diseases expect see significant drop deaths due influenza due social distancing extra safety precautions. 

All I'm trying say that, it'll impossible fully quantify excess deaths due COVID reasons mentioned added. However decent range calculated using method mentioned article making reasonable adjustments... 

Now figure denominator issue actually calculate mortality rate Yeah leapt virus November 2019 hard. faked vaccine middle school. realized enough doses day later. Needles big back then. still scared also realized fact scary enough organize escape it. Also, know wtf taking importance. comment intended reflect lack American tourists. someone understand, would mind giving little insight? understand post responded to. Appreciate it. Fuck vaccines yal fools 2 countries still closed borders, would argue still locked down. real world Sweden's death rate five times higher neighbours, that? Jesus Christ...you're dense. bar confirm reinfection high. needs stored sample first infection second infection. samples need sequenced viral genomes need sufficiently different. There's possibility person reinfected virus. However, there's way tell genomes different. Additionally, whole heck lot people samples stored (which see reinfections often health care workers whose samples likely stored internal testing). work construction job one largest subway maintenance complexes city live in. I'm around people often enough warrant 100% mask use - anyway respect others get virus myself, large complex vast number people about, even I'm direct contact them.

I find uncomfortable hell, I'm constantly moving / climbing / looking ears burn extremely painful touch end one 9-10 hour shift (thank fuck work 4 days 5). also made feel little stuffed days.

But I'll never stop guy start anti-masker. I'll tough means one less person die become severely ill. Let's get fucking shit show with. know AZ, TX, FL beat COVID moved shit. Midwest see peak all. That’s America done together mask mandate only. $$$  Explain? factories states remain open? even prison... Maybe see stupid individual, takes talking points bad sources. understand him. 

With Xi know saying news mis-translate selectively qoute. 

Whatever says say China CCP, one entity. Fellow brain fog sufferer here, thankfully bad (I’m sorry) still manage remember wear mask, keep distance people, wash hands. People looking wxcuse think put vote people would agree this, I’m tired Newsom Alameda county restrictions... Calm down. wrong though. South Korea never lockdown. China lockdown since April. implement strategy mass-testing isolation positive patients. Nope. I'm neither r/coronavirus masks ever anything last resort. However cannot usually keep distance 2 time, need mask. guy proved wrong. want answers origin virus along US Australia. Get it. Testing pretty much halted. Actually think TWD went downhill way slow. first 3 seasons great frustrating next seasons good episodes sprinkled entire episodes could skip. felt flip-flop good episode, bad episode, way long. finally got frustrated whole....and would rather died quick death like Star Trek:Enterprise did. Wasted much life almost giving show get hooked long enough question still watched it. brutal cycle me. country death rate like that. stupid you, can’t junior high math idiot. Blocked. Nice dm loser. masks people wear aren’t properly fitted.

So admit fitting issue type issue.

I thought serious conversation gaiter comment.

Are still referring goofy duke study one referring reason example scientifically illiterate population is?

What study referring since know one still ignorant enough referencing data Duke demonstration counterfeit masks testing, author said data used way using it? gay frogs? Hahaha looked post history. Waste time. conspiracy nut active spreader misinformation. 0.000025% virus can't cross state lines? MIAMI — Florida officials reported state’s biggest one-day total confirmed coronavirus cases since late August, day releasing pandemic data problem private testing Florida Department Health said Sunday 3,700 new cases previous 24 hours 1,790 day that. said 180 COVID-19 [deaths?] officials say received 400,000 previously reported test results late Friday Helix Laboratory, prevented processing releasing daily data report Saturday. Epidemiologists needed verify results make sure cases weren’t counted once. want punch statistics people still thinks virus like flu! Cloth masks easy make though. There's lot tutorials YouTube. need thread, needle, old shirt, elastic. use elastic one time use mask. I've made 8 far since pandemic started. I've slowly learned new patterns that's made many. Hey everyone look new alt u/T0rrent01 u/10pesjidi

Everybody report account like report alts well mods actually jobs. It’s not. refuse work, punished less privileges restrictive housing. simple Google search could told that, lack care many Americans demonstrate learning subject pass judgement form opinions continue. vote blue! account uses talking points (‘brunch’ misinterpreted AOC speech example, italicising emphasis) troll already admitted multiple accounts here. man? trust him? /s Lol mad “troll” conservatives think covid hoax?

They idiots, deserve called out. policies literally kills thousands people expect shut up? Disgusting ditching masks social distancing law, people able legally ditch masks socially distance. know didn’t work? time machine? Who’s say wouldn’t 2 million dead? tell one thing didn’t hurt! Idiot also deaths hardly risen, cases. nothing fact Michigan seeing another explosion even countries strictest measures place. Horrible response. immunity short lived seen coronaviruses, 50% known cases experiencing serious symptoms initial infection, that's problem. No, he's one telling want hear. day now...  You’re obtuse. Wearing masks helps risk management approach. majority arent 100% effective, it’s lowering risk shut already. Yeah feel like wash hands 50 times cooking food anyway, can't imagine virus surviving + cooking  dreaming...

Arizona decline weather related.Many governors attributed declines masks/lockdowns, fact, weather. simplistic people make be.

It must suck enough Worked better U.S. despite total enough.

Anyone cherry pick data.

How Thailand, Vietnam, New Zealand? big bad daddy pandemic responses, China? 215,000 dead. Clearly travel bans didn’t work. keep mentioning this? Don’t know makes look ignorant? submission removed because

90’s kid here. 40’s. jesus  Tbh sounds less like fear like taking responsible precautions look health. I’m telling feel eyes you’re intelligent responsible adult. Almost like cold dissuades people activities outside. actual death count 120k heard . Leaked documents showed govt declaring 30% deaths. bought office chair wfh.

Hey conservatives, really want economy go back normal wear goddamned mask hard That's good info thanks! sounds like still aerosol borne aerosol hangs around longer thought situations little ventilation. I’m still trying figure article title massive typo nobody caught publishing. hilarious twist irony, diversity turned biggest weakness.  Wear damn mask! Hard tell exactly got it. speculate hide lie everything NY 1425 cases today - weekend. That’s higher GA, decreasing summer surge. would watching closely temps drop. think part problem America long habit “wrong” side.

How many countries statues dedicated traitors country? We’ve got confederate monuments. laws many places preventing names attached pictures anti civil rights people (ever wonder history books never captions photos people against?)

Germans don’t nazi crap around. agree shit fucked up. It’s viewed national wound, part “heritage”.

America pretty weird. government mandates restrictions.

It's lack government action help need protect so. need dictator, need partner.

Federal role help risk otherwise support frontlines fighting thing.

I see much action either, White House hot zone. immunity vaccine about? immunity lost anyway. That’s entirely true Huh, think I’ve misunderstanding “90’s” kid. thought meant born 90’s lol Numbers argument. many bars human life worth? many middle class jobs? 

No one EVER gives answer this. Ever. back January/February: sorts disease outbreaks happen developing world. places poor health sanitation standards. best doctors hospitals here. We'll fine.

Also March/April: *surprised Pikachu face*  Funny tell cherry picking cherry picking. course. see numbers dropped 75% mask mandate, 100%. lol Vermont surprisingly San Francisco Bay Area places seemed respect across country. 

Was told didn’t need wear mask Texas, met people vacationing states specifically lack mask mandate since then. 

Plus, didn’t matter where, allowed, people dining everywhere. past months, articles posted daily COVID mutated. study indicates (as speculated) people exposed either variant protected (and vaccines development also protect both) China B52 equivalent? 75% dip Florida cases without mask mandate, mash help cause know I’m reddit rarity, mine teen love hanging him. people understood hot things hot Phoenix exist. democrats far bigger liars cheats.

Holy shit, that’s crazy. Literally designed medical industrial workers spec. many people making homemade masks buying favorite style (like privacy mask) I'm looking forward still wearing mask long covid over. I'm sick feeling asocial! say cops get bulletproof vests

And take locks doors

Defensive measures sign fear!  boggle mind many people refuse live fear guns. Korea, Taiwan, Australia NZ seek emancipation definition ""the species"" certainly truth that, conservative/republican problem wearing mask wish others would follow suit finally end shit live lives again. honestly insane people refusing wear masks point. (but honestly pisses wearing mask people wearing face shields nothing else) Same. really feel like Facebook plays major role. People feel insatiable need post photos cool things going cool places visiting friends family...but like, lungs likes us 4% U.S.  german numbers definitely don’t make sense. media reporting?

Where get french death count from? There's election couple weeks; think pretend everything hunky dory.

I get why. like Democrats would gone anti-mask Trump said, ""Listen Dr. Fauci wear mask."" True. I've felt back sliding bit. think hit 75k day July people got little jolt reality.  smart  Trolls gonna troll. Like florida  Yes. Idaho track historic state budget surplus. God: Instead trump almost getting Covid RNC, let’s make trump actually get Covid Hope Hicks. Well, *now* republican position deaths count people probably would died anyway.  extremely vibrant life pre-covid sheltering due high risk. People like nasty attitude sake wanting party huge issue. hope mature stay well. ✌🏻 Dumb fucks wearing mask months already Netherlands. People looked weird months. 

Now actually starting wear masks that's nice change. also proved Covid big deal old fat man. guess 5 years old limit parental devotion. time outsource raising child. Ignorant exactly? mouth throat though? say 2 weeks ago... bad job politics. *travel save* earlier. *Trust people* fucking mistake...

if think future, really bad.... Yikes.... thanks. Im interested future. recommend lockdowns Makes sense. Taiwan getting high number cases deaths every day? That's news me.   gonna end well. lockdowns continue morale improves, citizen. masking die vaccine coming hope unless someone vulnerable It’s prison trip Disneyland I've probably already spent $100 masks since March since shrink washing drying tend double cloth mask synthetic, wear two masks span one. 

One $80 mask sanitize replace filter actually sound bad. French report August 120 patients hospitalized found 34 percent memory loss 27 percent concentration problems months later. Thanks thoughtful post. 

Then obsessed surface cleaning? need work person people, probably try masks stick yoga tai chi promote fitness mental health without heavy breathing. South Korean gyms beginning pandemic outbreaks hit exercise classes yoga classes spared interesting. happened whether blood drawn vaccine I've passed past.

Since faint easily faint makes nauseous point subtle movement gag I've seen types doctors it. diagnosed Dsyautonomia and/or NeuroCardeogenic Syncop. Still sure actually one doctor called latter another former. Except didn’t include “in opinion” “ai believe that” anywhere, actually making statement. 
But sure, let’s agree everything wrote simply opinion indeed completely wrong opinion. worst part considered accomplishment 70% US making great sacrifices overcome selfishness 30%.

If 30% would way, would much, much bigger number, especially medical facilities overwhelmed. watched show forever. even want know? inhaled vaccines better general? kid told couldn’t take inhaled vaccines. never really thought asking again, better, would great explore option. 2021 going different 2020. disappeared Easter. think they’re saying isn’t forever, time party New Zealand. Right. many countries there? 1? 2? act like numerous $1200 checks dropped, that’s simply case. 

An extra 600 month whole lot literally dozens experts said there’s way COVID gets eradicated US, even 30 day lockdown. simply widespread.

First, fucking shit. shame anything.

Second, thirty days would long enough. would need like two months. pick arbitrary alexamples intentionally wrong make point bad faith. would present data back claims.
Last RKI survey left room improvement, even holiday season young people stopping care. original point NHS' initial plan focus vunerable front line workers. person responded provided quote supported statement. suggest either people calling vaccination programme take place go way misinterpet exchange here. stories yesterday, maybe got taken  people love feeling superior. blame trump “followers” feel better favorite people arrogant enough dictate well established human
behaviors like handshakes never return. Nothing could farther true happens... Every person gets vaccinated decrease spread. really matter is. Jesus every single comment contains world misinformation lmao. viruses similar sarscov2 (other coronaviruses/influenza) standard virus behaviour. ban MSN? Sure...whatever.  It’s lol. Science isn’t thing driving this. virus doesn’t decide people behave governments police it. Every nation bankrupt summer choose continue disruptive mitigations. stock ur bunker. Harsh reality, know. Lol think needles disguised square box like container stamp arm call vaccine print something people scared also think terrorism way overblown threat America, yes. plc\_nerd: ""Who cares 213,900+ American lives? me!"" maybe little lower average. Florida's slow days Monday Tuesday historically. *Indeed. was.* next question odd conclusion got comment. 

Lulz T2 diabetic here. often enough, get used it.

I used terrified needles. nothing now. yet keeps coming back...why Yeah, Vietnam, Thailand, New Zealand, fictional countries fo exsist.  That's brutal... mars outils mesure. It’s incomparable 280,000 suicides caused lockdowns. /s I’m hearing stay precisely 6 feet people never wear mask? Great also sounds simple could, yes. won't.

Source; family goes churches. Yikes... Yup... there's lot deliberate misinterpretation going on. Like right we've got official saying use ""primary"" virus control method seems suggesting somehow interpreted mean can't ""repeated"" long methods proven work circumstances, regardless whether continue work. lie. already established religion trump public safety. Building codes apply churches like anywhere else. frustrating disease. 200k+ dead US, 1M+ dead worldwide, yet time Chris Christie basically walking co-morbility beats it. dont know think anymore. Yeah, going slaughter. clearly thoroughly tested, get first round vaccines. Pretty much. Although live everyone wears masks. can’t go store without wear mask. won’t let in. test used. paper shows usable test - even give sensitivity specificity. 

It help us determine false positives vs false negatives, chain - yeah, germane. please, think understand I've read, pull sensitivity/specificity numbers paper linked. abundantly clear US mask mandates slowed rate infection areas enacted. people take time wash masks every day, yet still appear effective. 

When treating Covid patients, washing disposing masks every day much important since much exposed virus. However, everyday life masks still effective even regularly washed. simple. It’s anything anti-China posted, immediately downvoted. doesn’t really surprise communist country internet firewall, control citizens see, would stoop bots anti America/Pro China effort.  work reducing infections, completely eliminating possibility infection all. can't fault trying protect freedoms much possible (they foundations built society all, can't throw whenever convenient)

Convenient. Convenient? 6000 dead. died horribly. fucking ""convenience.""

It's bullshit. live Netherlands, way. argument, require building safety codes churches. 

And there's legal argument Constitution supposed prevent mask legislation rest us. wave Constitution us, make legal argument.

And RIVM keep shitting idea masks.

It's complete fuck government institute really strict mandatory countermeasures, get horribly bad first. 

6000 dead! We've 6000 cases per day last five days. much bad must they'll definitely comes that, worry.


I thought March. _too late._ COVID permanent here, thanks incompetent, spineless dishonest government. lot checks balances future holds. I’m personally pretty back normal(ish). work service I’m pretty excited get back work house. economic backup gov sounds great theory practice bankrupt us. High ups know this. Fauci scientist, policy maker. sounds cold virus isn’t concern. would take word extreme scenario. *This long way saying ""I prefer proudly ignorant, since born knowing everything need know"".* Masks make huge difference shown many studies. I’m going rely solely mask. I’m also relying social distancing. forced go workplace wear mask 8 hours day, would quit live savings years. Surely “just flu” argument gone now? [Experts caution expectations return normal Let’s say Donald Trump’s right get vaccine Election Day. pandemic magically go away get back normal, Well, really. fact, according panel experts Cap Times Idea Fest, we’ll masking social distancing time come. things get back normal, won’t normal we’re used “**It’s going like somebody switches switch sudden everything’s back normal**,” said James Conway, medical director immunization programs UW Health. “I think it’s going gradual process march three experts dispelled notion vaccine take us back pre-COVID times. take time, possibly years, get enough people vaccinated eradicate ***But even vaccine puts brakes COVID, old normal isn’t likely new “It may case even presence vaccine still wouldn’t want pack conference rooms people like used medical conferences shake hands,” Safdar said. “I think behaviors likely going go away long **There could substantial public health benefits building social distancing business usual.** instance, Australia, flu season ending, cases flu — kills tens thousands Americans year — hit record lows measures put place combat “Ultimately, best vaccine may years take traditional timeline developed,” said Conway. “I think people kind look significant number people resist vaccine, either skepticism fast-tracked approval process general anti-vaccine mindset. Polling August showed 35% Americans would willing get vaccinated COVID-19, many scientists say 60% 70% population needs immune achieve “herd immunity,” point virus can’t find enough hosts survive.

*Very* informative read. know might sobering Pollyannas, *certified health experts notable universities*, decide bash article, end awkward position fighting **science**. economy priority this, GDP tell whole story.

One example less companies went bankrupt Denmark peak previous years, even though much closed down. even be? answer printer went brrr. 

Looking government debts trend, see Denmark Finland really takes pandemic hit, Sweden Norway kept somewhat continuous trend before. mention another reply, Norway took $41 billion oil fund. 

Best overview five year:   Florida enters conversation. Didn’t announce limit sporting events? Yes...UV-B kills viruses absolutely not. opinion. Science Geez... Good thing listen WHO. mean 9/11 killed 1 100000 still show airport 2 hours early take shoes almost 20 years later. like  Anyone know legitimacy 'leaked NHS documents'? news running story Mail Sun, really trust either Whether stay home stop going sort events absolutely matter science moment. Population Density proximity UK/Europe Ah,I understand now. Thanks clarifying situation. previous post taken down? Mod says “repost” can’t even find earlier post referencing news. like 1957-1958 pandemic. Vaccine came given vulnerable helped contain pandemic put end pandemic status. [It's almost warning people deadly pandemic would actually make panic Right! Even poster admitted using alt accounts sub posts allowed remain. Meanwhile mods removing comments left right. lead ideologue facts, can’t make think version like. Oh shut absolute gobshite.  Taiwan never locked down. Quarantine. South Korea never locked - except places short period.

There's factors...not talked about.  I'm glad get close worst-case scenario 2,200,000 dead. countries qualify civilized, according you? York County PA coming hot hot zones, bunch ignorant fucks disregard social distancing mask requirements Fair enough. We've got idiots charge federal government sure can't really control states do. roll numbers. Sure, could couple backwards states playing shenanigans, think difference reporting seriously overblown definitely like China. know news looks really bad outsiders perspective since really see Trump.

I wish luck. really hope crush curve again. true. heard Dr. Daniel Griffin Week Virology podcast say underwater took weeks water.

It’s excellent point. hospital system close collapse rescued large part generosity people coming help risk health. always remember help. Thank you. It’s true, that’s japan low death rate. It’s sad tell truth It’s impossible eradicte even vaccine. none live normal. Society move eventual immunity prevail every virus outbreak. terms death rate anot extremely bad flu. flu already dangerous enough elderly, fact people downplaying influenza deaths highly disingenuous. Influenza deaths matter grandmother that's dying pneumonia. percentage unreported cases obviously highly variable region. places tested 50% people, could 10 X infections means. test rates low possibility. idea happening Maryland.

As 1 20 asymptomatic, again, one saying that. lot symptomatic people test negative. Bad test? Flu? can't know. measure ignorance.  saying goes, really know death rate. Everything else inferred. second literally months Oh man watched Contagion last night too! comparing us? Compare countries like Norway Finland etc idea going available? interpreted mean freezing rain get soaked immune system susceptible inevitably get exposed virus (in normal times people interacting enough it’s around). sure true anecdotally seems possible think time I’ve gotten sick anyway. seems like consensus true infections somewhere around 5-8x gets caught testing, assuming decent level testing (say, 2-2.5k tests per million per day). Even controlled spread US, nursing homes would still locked pandemic official end. one would risking vulnerable gamble. dont always fever........that's absolutely ridiculous. know 3 people personally, 2 didnt fever whole thing.... Actually asshole, willing accept reinfection rate might lower. nothing said actually refuted points.

Im engaging further. actually respond anything. immediate evidence sufficient conclusion, works ways. point sub happy jump conclusions direction, declaring things super spreader hotbeds comes fruition (including US school reopenings). ""Wait February"" can't apply positive indicators. people won’t make theories track you... hope way virus works 20% people responsible 80% spread. people super-spreaders infect dozens people, people infect one. real life, people infect many others others don’t spread disease all. fact, latter norm, Lloyd-Smith says: “The consistent pattern common number zero. **Most people transmit.”** Yet, according president, disappearing. don’t go look articles posted 5 months ago answer next President United States commit joining international effort distribute vaccine, not? Either way, American people deserve know. Shades buffoon governor Arizona crippling spike. Yeah, too. Everytime got injection, sensation liquid pushed really affects me. control myself, kid, parents nurses needed hold down. Bill Gates New World Order going microchip everyone? /s better part we'll vaccines. Take harder look, y'all. party y'all trying ruin? true. Javits center used. hospital ship wasn’t helpful bureaucracy transferring patients much overwhelmed staff use. doubt tons smart people China, trust Chinese government anyone business them. Lega another 3000 positive tests. Yes percentages lower, know quickly numbers explode exponentially. pop density Chicago make numbers really scary 11 states set records new cases seven-day period:

Alaska, Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota Utah. not. ones bad enough get tested twice, places exposer needed testing once.

Yes, is. 22 is, unequivocally, 0.00005% 38.8 million. isn’t fact wish away. Many people get tested...

Oh, maybe reinfection rate even lower. Somehow doesn’t occur you. facts know *22* cases now. course probably also probably non-reinfectiom cases too. know numbers know doesn’t matter why. already pointed twice article. aware misrepresenting things anyways support preconceived ideas started instead learning growing things presented you.

I misrepresented anything. I’ve said based facts know conclude nothing reinfection possible, unexpected concerning itself. preconception I’ve made likely act coronaviruses have. evidence contrary justifiable default position.  thanks, fam. Living life bubble life worth living. lockdown need to. refute claim speak behalf, presumed valid. 10:36 earliest US (as write this) even day old yet. sindemic, punishment decadent lifestyles.  know better. Spain, france, uk, italy Vaccine chemtrails lol Two weeks! mistakenly thought vaccinated turns TB testing. Would great helps. people idiots... playing lives!!!! handful examples general fuckery numbers state level, either mistakes/bad data odd report somebody trying hide school cases you. one sub ever able provide evidence happening systemically national scale, I’ve asked quite times see posts talking Trump WH “definitely manipulating data. Especially well liked objectively incorrect conspiracy theory numbers started improve mid July. It’s one things people feel true seems basis reality. course one *wants* - still advocated necessary order buy time regroup, much necessary netherlands. healthcare cancelling non-covid related procedures, weve testing shortage months now, weve never tracing sorted community spread never contained, numbers going crazy. ideally, regrouping preparations wouldve happened summer cases dropped, didnt that, we’re unprepared struggling. course prevention better reaction, didnt bother preventing. yes, necessary evils needed. Thank good explanation else thing infecting? every weeks hearing something new. Scary. however give disastrous advice wear masks right beginning though even claiming bullshit like wearing n95 mask increased risk exposure touch face.

Granted, data yet, basically nobody countries came conclusion.

They say lied run masks depriving health care workers them, Kushner running entire logistics program COVID inevitable anyway, fact decided onset lie hurt credibility. get hit paywall, see googled it, sounds like me.. watched first twilight movie scene Rob sucks bloody wrist, never fainted movie theater. leave lol never define mean ""lockdown"" - I've heard used describe total, ""you need excuse leave house"" restrictions, I've also heard applied less severe restrictions, like gatherings 25 restrictions bars restaurants. 

We're deep enough know total lockdowns overkill, also deep enough learned masks restrictions (spacing restaurants, limiting crowd sizes) work well. Fuck that, crazy? people find vaccines unpleasant, arguing there. people legitimate, severe needle phobia really respond reason like that. Attacking typo? That's tactic someone already lost argument realized they're wrong. Governor dumbass. SEC ACC set restrictions conferences. say whatever wants. Florida already said last night. **Summary [Boris Johnson's ""no old normal"" future white rosy. Lots people lost jobs due COVID-19 (i.e. lockdowns), Brexit decision. need cooperate want reduce risk COVID-19 build better society. 

*When pandemic over, going back normal.** release vaccine COVID-19 transport us back 2019; that's *last* thing want, actually. pandemic perfect opportunity launch widespread social economic change, fix previous underlying chronic ills disgraces society. rethink get energy; goal mind, invest 160 million pounds wind turbine manufacturing, successfully run wind power 2030. 

We shall improve testing contact tracing *the next years*, extend furlough scheme. help solve unemployment crisis. opening not. reason would cause COVID-19 cases deaths counts surge overwhelm country again. people think like short-sighted. sooner accept status quo ante 2019 returning, progress make long run.

Going back normal enough. lost pandemic much. much hardship us even *think* going back normal. Think lesson everyone learn, repair effort. Again, want make world better place future generations English people, *we need cooperate* Build Back Britain. We're together. still around UK, fact 18 one NHS allowed give   You’re clear. Kiss ya want :) wishing today could get vaccine progress along fast Mass Effect! Mate you’re gonna use alt accounts, least try change way write NEVER returning old normal

Lol, like past pandemics, NEVER went back in-person schooling, social gatherings, etc.? Humans social beings, many countries already back “old normal”. Don’t worry, go back normal regardless vaccine. 2009 pandemic, several U.S. studies among 2 17-year-olds found nasal spray vaccine effective influenza B viruses influenza A(H3N2) viruses inactivated influenza vaccines, less effective inactivated flu vaccines 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. data led ACIP CDC recommend use nasal spray vaccine 2016-17 2017-18 Source: Still amazed seem forgotten past triumphs. them. tend much damaging skin tissue never really caught on. Also vaccines go subcutaneous tissue muscle, blood stream. got sprayed nose swine flu. nice experience last flu shot I'll take vaccine either way. Boris fcking buffoon. short ago asking everyone go restaurants bars. He’s directly responsible incredible mess. Literally exact verse used justification divine right rule nearly 1000 years. Probably still, they’re quiet now. question mods continue allow misinformation posts posted continuous basis. 

You proven troll posts things basis reality. Thank you! keep bouncing thinking good trash, I'm glad people seem enjoy it. also, criticism help future. think governments easing lockdowns. miss part mentioned Florida Texas? totally ignored two worldometer links posted. embarrassing part United States death toll March/April, happened that. one loved ones becomes one 0.2 percent think understand. cares? Bro real? virus weird hell Dr Fauci also says lockdowns shouldn’t necessary US; public health pandemic guidelines enough. 

(Of course people aren’t keeping safe distance apart / wearing masks public, lots sickness deaths.) might vasovagal syncope. talking something serious it’s best fudge numbers. 7-day moving average new cases US hasn’t 50,000 since mid-August. moving average exceeded 50,000 7/4 8/17. past week, moving average would better characterized “35,000+” “40,000+”. Stop misinformation. I'm NY get rapid test almost day want. could also explain races darker skin tone generally harder hit children usually better off. need know COVID19 become endemic animals. idea bad things could get feral cats start spreading COVID19? act soon may start killing cats mass. Let's respect sacrifice cats made actually deal this. Yeeees I’ve post posing flu shot reason intranasal flu one year, let tell head rush. sure you’re ready :) It’s new. It’s said since January ffs. They're mixing Virgin Mary Typhoid Mary again.

Seriously guys, ""love neighbor"" rocket science!

\*grumbles Annoyed Christian\* I’m down, know shots don’t hurt much, massive phobia needles can’t stand buildup waiting shots. think issue needle manufacturing production literally billions people. sure improved one point logistic issue would slow vaccine distribution. see done data analysis then. Yea thats reaction psyched into. nurse, would hate seeing people comments. Fuckin group up. always people hundred tattoos anyone else going try get flu shot inhaled version? want get scared.
Let doctor put needle dick draw blood erection lasted longer need to. Exactly. won’t correcting lifestyles, we’ll collectively deal sickness death science comes magic pills. don’t breath mouth either. don’t think you’re supposed mask?

Yeah sweat hard. live USA south, less pleasant wearing one summer, unbearable. got nasal one swine flu always pass injections (even got tuberculosis test).

I didn’t realize “live” vaccine ended getting swine flu. remember hit biked 8 miles friends house (didn’t car) hanging friends back yard. remember asking, “Did buy strong shit? swear I’m contact high, I’m gonna lie down.” went inside laid couch.

Woke mom screaming, “HE’S MOVING HE’S MOVING!” Apparently I’d slept 30 hours everyone freaking out. knew didn’t health insurance didn’t want call ambulance didn’t live parents didn’t know number phone locked didn’t know call.

Ever since got fear needles. I’ll take passing second getting live vaccine. misinformation? Health experts, economists, etc beginning talk this. misinformation? made assumption months ago feel it’s worth repeating again. recent case teenage COVID death North Dakota - 17 year old girl (VERY YOUNG). glanced article picture don’t mean rude girl severly obese. think coincidence severly overweight obese people prone general diseases like diabetes hypertension seems like give hard time catch Covid even kill (knock wood). I’m medical school student proffesor Internal medicine compares obese mild constant general inflammation whole body (yes whole body means eyes, brain, heart, lungs, liver,kidneys on). generalization also practical meaning - get systemic infectious disease fact obese makes matters worse obesity put layman’s terms worsens one’s ability fight disease consequences quite dramatic. obesity problem exclusive America become global problem last decades. Europe every 1 2 adults average overweight obese, that’s fucking 50% that’s humongous amount fat people, means larger amount deaths cardiovascular, oncologic diseases, means larger strain health service limited supplies, means larger strain country’s budget also limited... see I’m going. Nowadays can’t say anyone he’s fat get jumped milions snowflakes slaughter fat shaming. whole idea „plus size models” dramatic consequences sends false message already obese fat people it’s okay fatass stop thinking diet habits don’t even try fix it. results ever growing number fat fucks worsening general health society. watched documentary country dating 50 years ago. noticed fact back seeing obese people really rare, like 95% people healthy weight range slim. Nowadays medicine advanced 50 years ago still continue get advanced future think MUCH HEALTHIER general society would 95% people would right weight range. Fifty years ago possible wouldn’t today? talk problem raise peoples’ awareness fat fuck matter individuals also indirect effect country’s health care finances. tell people: „Hey fat fuck late change life, don’t go gym lose weight, hell don’t even go walk times week (although recommended) must fix shitty diet habits put fork go back healthy weight range”. Lastly realise much disservice served retarded people tell general public obese/overweight, well mongs labeled medical condition/illness dramatic consequences many matter elaborated above. Nopenopenopenope nurse give alcohol pads. Open inhale prevent passing out. gets bad, left legs chair hand apparently NZ autralia You’re good person looking kids, it’s shame they’re mother couldn’t Wrong. declaration imply let things go free deal vulnerable later. misrepresenting it. Nation nothing collection people.

Are desperate fight totally missed implications calling lifestyle driven diseases solved “magic pills”?

Parse out. It’s difficult see I’m saying. ditched last year wasn’t worth it. friends still work living working exit plans. 

The people happy ones don’t need rely income live. Hopefully done Rona McDonald soon least locally-sourced, farm-to-table vaccine. kind grandma used make. actually like watching process getting blood drawn. It’s cool see spurt vacuum test tube. cut hat bleeding quickly though, would tough handle. case polio too. Anti Vaxxers like use fact oral polio cause polio. Like cases total reason polio vaccine shouldn’t taken. perspire lot wearing prolonged periods time makes face feel gross sweaty. rarely breathe mouth either. breathe well, general, either. Nope bloodpressure spikes falls fast nearly stopped heart. feel rest day. much second really lame. Colder weather people spending time inside? 0 evidence rise cases coming schools tRUmp vAcCiNe mOnTH TRYONG KEEP SICK INSIDE ANTIFA Hopefully 3rd wave like 2nd first attitude throughout middle country quite heartwarming. fatality rate would deaths divided number infected. many confirmed tested infected? say ten million(s)? That's 220k/10m. math comes 0.003. 3%? move decimal? That's vaccine, tetanus one notorious causing soreness. like that...but, yeah. tetanus vaccine *sucks*. Moving goalposts changing topic. Oh great. *finally* get rid evil test eye doctor shoots air eyeballs, gotta deal shooting stuff noses! Can't catch break.



For real though, sounds amazing. Bin privatversichert, ich check das mal ab. Yes see, something missing, world seems confused. humor, maybe recommandations colored childproof instructions 🤪 I’d rather get IM vaccine isn't. said nation done anything it. nation CAN'T anything it. bragged European. Wait till anti-vax lot get load this, they'll banging shit like ""no vaccine! Bill Gates wants spray AIDS mouth!"" dumb shit. Downvoted correct... would call employee claiming speak behalf BS? disprove claims? get veto authority? Adolph Hitler voted President Germany August 1934. mean fascist? shift opinion actually misinformed Republicans getting high political propaganda. Congrats, encouraging hate getting shots, get 'em necessary. situation makes necessary. 

I'm still holding hope invent hypospray time vaccine rollout. Except question Americans gone, knocking us million, us. redundant. Great idea.

I can't wait see antivaxxers feel this. gonna shitshow. That’s literally said. well shit lol. still lockdown stuff. totally enforced. nothing ever going happen dont people going stuff Someone arguing right eat indoors right now. Apparently getting take unsustainable Excellent plan force antivaccine gang wear full face mask. think us problem obesity? Forcibly starve obese people? Whip exercising?

This problem ""solvable"" individuals involved willing so. That's 220,000 divided number confirmed untied states deaths figure approximately death chance infected. many United States confirmed infected math look like here? Anyone know? Us Europeans hypocrites. we’re wrong sometimes ;) die loneliness, directly yes Oh yeah, gathering thing. meant business closures/stay home order. needs more, always department health anyway though, doesn’t really matter I’d rather needle nasal spray. can’t stand feeling. You’re going downvote next posting website lol. You’re tool. Dr. Cranjis Mc.Basketball? 
Do Dr. Cranjis Mc.Basketball list?! One earliest recorded forms “vaccination” crushing scabs smallpox victims dust inhaling them.

This predates William Jenner’s use cowpox inoculate smallpox. explains day-to-day variation update times, 3+ day delay. Well, yes, options better.

Like inhalable flu vaccine, bunch counter-indications. Yet, Europeans call Americans retarded daily basis thing. gap Brazil US widening... theory technology evolve go backwards No, things don’t need 100% perfect lift unconstitutional restrictions people’s lives. People need go back work. Sick weak people need stay home. majority people fine, be. That’s disease works. Delaying herd immunity incredibly stupid. know left taken golden football ran home touchdown. Funny.
GBD: allow minimal risk death live lives normally
WHO: advocate lockdowns primary means control time believe lockdown justified buy time reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources

Can tell difference, beyond that, emotionally? Didn’t release data pretty resoundingly rejected hypothesis? failure refute given BS make ""valid"". Really strange. Masks mandatory Spain Italy Germany France cases surging countries Surprised see Wisconsin Unfortunately, infected back March, likely anymore antibodies. actually sides. post easily attacked alarmist crap think **hilarious** sarcasm give brigaders straw man attack. insane.

criminal. oldest daughter got blood work, vitamin 20ng/ml... got get up, I've paranoid catching virus. [guest Amy Rosenfeld ](http://www.enterovirus.net/) Wear eye mask even notice. got blood drawn flu shot even feel it. teacher get triggered watch us continue leave behind minorities kids low income homes? I'm teacher, high school, also 2 kids distance learning. kids learned shit school, since school got last March. home help would completely lost.

On daily basis talk kids class 2 bedroom apartment, trying share wifi Hotspot 3 younger siblings moms work. internet, constantly leave try help younger siblings, pretty soon start give up. college, trade school, better life them. continuing fail kids need us widening gap nots.

As teacher, thats triggered about. country cases went fast went locked got handful cases.

Then opened cases went **half speed.**

This made sure hospitals get overwhelmed. 'the people', we're together mercy weak leadership egocentric people.

Good luck brother across pond! Keep safe! October 7, 2020 - **Pre-Print**

Abstract 
-
It increasingly recognized SARS-CoV-2 produce long-term complications recovery acute effects infection. Here, report analysis 32 self-reported short long-term symptoms general adult population cohort comprised 233 COVID-19+ cases, 3,652 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls, 17,474 non-tested individuals. majority COVID-19+ cases mild, 8 233 COVID-19+ cases hospitalized. **Our results show 43.4% COVID-19+ cases symptoms lasting longer 30 days, 24.1% still least one symptom 90 days. numbers higher COVID-19+ cases initially ill, 59.4% 30 days 40.6% 90 days, even mild initially asymptomatic cases, 14.3% complications persist 30 days longer.** contrast, 8.6% participants general untested population develop new symptoms lasting longer 30 days due illness study period. **The long-term symptoms enriched COVID-19 anosmia, ageusia, difficulty concentrating, dyspnea, memory loss, confusion, headache, heart palpitations, chest pain, pain deep breaths, dizziness, tachycardia. additionally observe individuals initial symptom dyspnea significantly likely develop long-term symptoms.** Importantly, study finds overall level illness important variable account assessing statistical significance symptoms associated COVID-19. study provides baseline understand frequency COVID-19 long-term symptoms population level demonstrates that, although likely develop long-term COVID-19 complications initially severe illness, even mild asymptomatic courses infection increased risk long-term complications. mean, guess live places like South Dakota, right. largely lifestyle issues. many nations, especially US, proven unwilling correct issues. Obesity T2 Diabetes aren’t going anywhere without magic pills solve them. Hmmm... gets later kissing him, hope updates post. Colorado, becoming ugly. good handle things people let guard down. I'm really sure path here. shutdown needed get colder weather businesses life support is. 
Here Colorado Springs, sound ambulance sirens hospital helicopters non-stop since last Thursday. happened weekends, afaik. yeah, really evidence say effective Unless completely eliminate virus 0, continue spread. indefinite lockdown feasible, work leaders see this. think better comparisons European nations.

The Denmark Norway locked hard. Sweden didn't.

The outcome end same. Sweden deaths _but_ state countries right essentially (and actually Sweden better right economically, total wellness standpoint).

Lockdowns meant prevent surges hospitals lead excess death. Yeah bro watched Contagion pretty big based sample size I’ve work last week. love soccer mommies think read. remove rooster hens

Huh. That’s new one novel. People dying suffering COVID restrictions. Even directly due covid.

Yeah, no. Good luck getting people take precautions vaccine widely distributed. Lots lots people already basically back pre-COVID normalcy except might wear masks public spaces due state mandates. It’s risible think many people taking precautions vaccine. 

And me, I’ve social distancing avoiding indoor gatherings since March I’m willing continue until, maximum, next fall. don’t go beyond that.

They pick battles hill die on.

I virus back March. Yes, pretty light. Coughing non stop chest hurt breathing. However, never stopped wearing mask making sure safe. Never tell people relax country shouldn’t shut down. listed experts

These ignorant people deserve sympathy think vinegar kills virus (at least light wiping)...The virus falls apart within day food, paper, clothes. Personally, clean packaging rubbing alcohol transfer produce different plastic bags go fridge. Anything I'm using day go fridge, bother cleaning let sit bag couple days.

This well good, unless buried somewhere, article fails mention *what* ""Focused Protection"" entails.

So certainly understand haughty indignance wanting point high horse *le stupid redditors*, though I'm sure gets end day, perhaps could introduce conversation there's actually little merit case.

We listen experts here, good we're told work, does?  TLDR: 21 new imported cases, 0 new domestic case, 23 new imported asymptomatic carriers,0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

The vast majority people disobeying rules probably poorer backgrounds. fining actually achieve anything, likely turn 'class' issue.

Cushy middle class people generally afford stay indoors month. Oh nooooo, 100 years ago? Shouldn’t today’s presidents knowledgeable simply better 100 years ago? Irrelevant said thanks. Yes USA like Nazi Germany. ironic sad. Yet countries 100% mask wearing still virus Luckily, usually usually pretty good consensus among medical professionals. Certainly among elected politicians. 

The logic behind simple enough. vote politicians lead government, give us medical advice. go doctor. would assume people would feel similarly comes deadly global pandemic! title article rubbish, making appear large gatherings *with* masks ok. I've since mid February posts human rights lawyer china, seared memory.

You correct sub taken stupid interests downplaying virus demonstrate insane number is:

France

Population: 67 million 

Cases today: 27,000

USA

Population: 350 million 

Cases today: 47,000 sick since pandemic became prevalent US. wife 3 kids wear masks public. past years, sickness would sweep household monthly basis. believe masks precautions reason why. someone believe masks work truly fucking moron.  ""Congratulations, played yourself."" went walk today, sloppy fat maskless guy (a stereotypical redneck) ahead spit ground behind. felt fucking disgusted. imagine refuse put mask middle deadly pandemic, spit sidewalk tons people pass everyday? knew lot knuckle-dragging idiots like yet somehow I’m still shocked absurdity comments lmao 

From August 14th (so numbers higher):

The number deaths United States July 2020 8 percent 12 percent higher would coronavirus pandemic never happened.

That's least 164,937 deaths number expected first seven months year – 16,183 number attributed COVID-19 thus far period – could high cause claim proof something obvious. 

right wrong depend opinion. thus wrong default. According article, China committed sharing vaccines dozen nations, particularly low-income countries close ties joined COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX), collaborative effort Gavi, Vaccine Alliance, together Coalition Epidemic Preparedness Innovations WHO, aiming provide 2 billion doses vaccine vulnerable people health-care workers, especially poor told World Health Assembly May vaccines would “global public good”, list countries China promised share vaccines continues grow.

And people still worried China going vaccines. 

Shouldn't people concerned *other* countries going vaccine? questioning United States America, leader free world, follow China's lead, make declarations? Expected? dude enough blubber power small city middle aged. poor elected official he’d dead. part help prevent spread illness death? it. please glasses fog much Go Hey man, poor people color affected disproportionally take consideration talk holding us back. Wtf wrong lol

America millions infected.  1. can’t shoot bullets virus
2. Covid doesn’t oil

Ergo republicans don’t give fuck. south really dumb. America: land professional victims number increasing fast can't keep up... damn sad

Not mention survivors suffer long term damage reduced lifespan well oiled machine.   Lol. Yep. Thats case. That's criminal That's ridiculous argument. could say bad situation - give hope accept it. Also artcile place. Look consecutive paragraphs (OK think second one automatically inserted algorithm link ""relevant"" There's nothing wrong hoping better, stable future, New York University psychology professor Gabriele Oettingen told USA TODAY. important realize likely long-term fantasy, said. Hope luxury: essential mental health. Maybe tell give guns stop living fear/s.
See great goes over. record 40% approval rating. party called democrat, policy less referred republican today. Could one please explain title ""potentially misleading""? Here's start article you: hard-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, dismissed Covid-19 “[little said faced “[like man,  sneered self-isolating “[for raged lockdown measures. clashed state governors, [former health savaged handling pandemic.  Brazil counts nearly 5 million [Covid-19 147,000 dead, Bolsonaro popular ever. nice idea think would work. happen Fauci Betsy Davos health instead? prove opposite? person made assertion, prove it?

By logic, guess make irrefutable fact biggest idiot reddit. can't ask proof, I'm right matter what. estimating number missed cases? still like 10/1. maybe 80 million Americans it. double level herd immunity? bears repeating, infection fatality rate useful context data. Primarily, easily virus spreads. 0.6% huge number we're talking disease capable infecting world population literally given hoping states like Florida. entire logic wrong headed point can't muster sympathy anyone local community. testing levels then? dangerous take contagiousness real meaning. sure, go ahead.

I guess done here, then? never give up, you? That’s absolutely big part also. thread similar study. Two thirds symptoms two months, study included patients hospitalized (majority not). Death hoax, maybe? People suffocating masks?

Just wild guess part. &amp;#x200B;

canada healthcare overall cheaper actually dying ther wait time abit excessive

but better simply care cant afford usi think us ranks high get care want/need within weeks pay it

the ranking go based general public instead rich meh

I ibs took 3months see GI suffering one best insurances friend canada told wait year find hemmoroids?is correct medical term I'm sick hearing HQC. dead, bury it. point people still going wear masks even mandate. people wear nose protest mask wearing. think mandate implemented, reality people dont give fuck. Gyms reopened temporarily July shut 2 weeks ago major cities like Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Lille, etc. Yup, it’s really human nature need blame “somebody”... people remind Caucasian suburban housewife chiding someone Whole Foods checkout line bringing reusable bags strolling gas guzzling SUV...  Yes schools obviously dont spread it/s mean technically something country care current situation control. something countries bad bother with. European countries done second wave effects vaccine take time occur. Therefore, safe people like *you* go forget pandemic, likely might fully protected vaccine. take appropriate precautions, like social distancing mask wearing, reduce chances happening.

Imagine that, ended infecting one immunocompromised neighbors. elderly relatives. 

As doctors saying, vaccine ""magic gold dust"" returning normal. know that's lot might wanting believe, sounds good all, remember: *the best scenarios always realistic*. reality, vaccine *one more* weapon arsenal COVID-19, along mask-wearing, social distancing, gathering restrictions, closures/cancellations. replace them, complements them. everyone, opposition, trouble grasping accepting beyond me. 2022

Source? Nope school front cost giving hassle mom town got money back making big fit 


also correction favorite son thing canada japan/denmark/sweden people mostly refer tocanada culture alot closer guess people would bother read info rki.de instead asking shove throats. troll, right? can't honestly believe that. People really need start making distinction herd immunity absolutely goal since total eradication feasible (and would require herd immunity anyway point).

The issue methods. differentiating confusing scientificly illiterate ignorant folks makes feel justified fighting useful measures. no, lockdowns lasted months, countries werent ready (westerns) cause asian countries always ready. believe locking wearing masks either comment history. Stop shilling subreddit Ever injected Iodine contrast? typically used see circulatory system CAT scan believe

Actually feels warm instead. strangest feeling makes think pissed pants. Fair last point. guess said secondary measure severity damage lasts 7 months, statement worded poorly. 

My point restriction whole population lockdown, different level one. argued either way suppose. even close isolated unless consider 3,000+ inmates facility guards barely screened come go. I’ve going EOS fitness Phoenix Arizona 3 4 times week since gym re-opened two months ago. safe. Masks required inside. you’re curious going gym, experience safe. Where? certainly noticed NYC. Looks like duck, walks like duck...

Really though teaching English? need embarrassed, China needs English teachers. Canada not. Cause I've died like 7 times definitely one WORST dont need vaccinate everyone. First focus people risk. people live close people ( mainly people big city centers). reached 50% everyone vaccinated reaching herd immunity. Remember whole lot population antibodies virus also slow spread. honestly baffled people seem think problem information itself. obvious ability person think critically powerful information? problem one education critical thinking (its skill anyone capable thought learn) disinformation. always misleading motives info. Immunity comes applying critical thought. want live like maybe buy hazmat suit full face respirator safety. 

You say handle one thing time. would work free slaves prevent getting sick, get replacements cost?  Maybe get better constitution then?

And actually doubt unconstitutional, given circumstances. It'd nice unbiased, international inquiry looked origin virus. far PRC denied it.

And knowledge, DRC refuse scientists investigating. And? That's different US Australia specifically saying China alone investigated. 100 countries want answers. US buddies want distraction. Wait wait wait, thought masks solution stay home meant last resort? (Referring recent guidance). masks mean failed? can’t keep up.

While one random picture makes strong case... (/s) I’m going go first person accounts friends family Manila. didn’t state “opinion”, merely pointed complete BS. countries still using though? thought abandoned it. Australia, Israel wales perhaps? Yes agree. live biggest city NZ. also self-sufficient wealth resources. 
All shut borders quarantine people coming in, difficult. Jews 😎 🙄exactly. Maybe things complicated. Maybe simple. going assume quoting greatest leader pandemic translates is.

/s Stupidity immortal. Okay great let's shut 2 months come back, 80% small businesses shut unemployment rate sky high.

There easy solution here. Lockdown never #1 option. don't. [100 countries asking third party inquiry origin like US Australia alone. Coincidence!!! /s spike children 10 19 concerning. schools still open? know. I've seen plenty people failing soooo miserably trying inhale sprayed medicines, know 100% effective. Especially among boomers older population USA. Well half right. trying understand think everyone trying lie disinform. Yeah, humans also xenophobic wary strangers; elements nature trying overcome mixed results last decades. surprise return deep visceral distrust anyone outside ""bubble,"" however large small turns be. Genuine question. critical urgency around right now? Appreciate cases obviously spiking hospitalisations seem still way first peak (like quarter level). surely can’t imminently overload hospitals? missing -thanks think people would adhere recommendations. since mask wearing intrusive simply keeping distance stir counter movement well would see demonstrations mask usage countries requiring masks.

It could also give elderly population false sense security change behaviours. Currently people 70 years old told avoid gatherings pretty much close anyone.
 
Personally mind masks required traveling public transportation. necessity get work keeping distance rush hours almost impossible. long methods proven work circumstances, regardless whether continue work.

So, like lockdowns, then? vaccine needle tiny. got one human trail vaccines arm pain later would barely known. Face shields acceptable replacement all.

These unnecessarily lax rules gointo drag things make selfish dipshits comfortable.

So shamefully selfish. MSN one article written for. Washington examiner... even know source. Please educate yourself. hurts also understand fall denier, mask wearing people. open link Invest 2-3 min. copy without taking effort Bullshit someone said anti lockdown, antimask subs. call sceptic even read article. even know origin (which big article see). God alone knows survived long. even understand system msn... really hard belief really this... Nvm wear mask Buddy follow local rules minimize spread family end sub comedy part like many deniers caught sometimes even lost family members. Okay. least respect argument. would suggest locked 12 weeks still positive tests? seems really contingency plan place apart lockdown indefinitely. president said Google would screening website people could fill questionnaire find get test. back March. website. People ""imprisioned"" allowed make holidays Covid-Land, allowed meet friends home, allowed walk park cycle around, allowed go work …

BUT BEER 8 !!!!!!!11eleven feel like people saying ""eh everyone else going up, we're basically same"" failed calculus.

Measuring area curve important thing, even lines meet point, rather maintain low case spike high case count whole time. That's interesting know, source information? Yep agreed 💯 Lol maybe you’re working mall church (important economic activity Poland ...) make argument crowded places pandemic good idea????

Shopping praying online exist keep us safe!! Time get large pump backpack sprayer, fill thing, visit antivaxxer convention. course it’s case.

Except, again, facts know, could possibly be.

The fact numerous people claimed reinfected virus way confirming reinfection strain. cases definitively confirm genomic sequences significantly different stored samples. apply nearly cases 50% 22.

Again, 8 16. 8 can. can’t say they’re asymptomatic say symptoms.

No, can't. information given. mean ""no symptoms."" completely totally dishonest say N/A means symptoms.  3 4 diagnosed health care facilities indicating seeking treatment. title article doesn’t seem relevant. discusses immunity reinfection, protection disease.

You really understand immune system. Immunity reinfection protection disease. ""protective immunity"" talk protection reinfection protection disease. That's immune memory works. Nothing I’m saying really dependent though.

Sure is. basis entire rehashed argument. read somewhere long lasting cellular immunity coronaviruses assumed protective immunity. not. Humoral immunity would protective immunity require infection immune clearance. virtually diseases immune system encounters basis vaccination. humoral immunity short lived, protective immunity going short lived reinfection remains real possibility. Vietnam,Taiwan every patients get it, meet certain criteria drug used. Yes made without eggs called Comcast insert IV fiber optic cables keep family safe. We’re still waiting. We’ve call customer service six times technicians failed show every 6 hour window they’ve given us. Comcast killing American families.  true, deaths / infected Canada closer 5%??? state, equally important. Masks less among social bubbles people know regularly interact (households, families friends attending wedding, etc.). experience public health care worker (working government actually right thing), restrictions depend whether active community transmission sustained community transmission. especially important enforce social distancing mask-wearing public commercial spaces cases clusters cannot traced origin/link. event people cannot expected socially distance, masks second line defense especially high risk areas. work entire region health services deemed high risk since one health care worker close contact case tested positive.

Ugh omg. exhausting. You’re referring post viral fatigue. It’s common lingering side effect almost every virus. Using terms like “permanent” “life-long” disingenuous. idea, referencing viruses, they’re typically permanent. 

Secondly, virus young. pandemic not. year point. sensational headline. Nothing new lockdown last measurement... “The time believe lockdown justified buy time reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, protect health workers exhausted, large, we’d rather it.”

So lf use: ""protect health workers exhausted"" ""reorganize"" maybe Western World use localized lockdowns (many countries try implement useful rules guess) china (maybe india?) act drasticly past.

Keep it.  seem forgetting manufacture vaccine distribute it......let’s face it, getting first, probably unless politician, first responder billionaire. 

If one people likes travel, won’t back normal, allot countries can’t get vaccines, you’ll bring COVID back.

And still sure can’t get COVID19 it, unless NZ wiped COVID19 community, long haul. That’s denying, really thick lockdowns negative repercussions? really selfish privileged naive child think that.

And often, isn’t worth it. Good guess. Meanwhile state cleverly blocked people allow felons served time voteing, thinks filling stadiums 90,000 fans good idea pandemic. see that's relevant. two theories -

he doesn’t want ‘cheap immigrant labour‘ Ireland severe threat lockdowns started already Sure: 

- importantly lot testing. lot contact tracing. Isolation positive cases close contacts - even asymptomatic - tested negative twice. 

- strong reminder recommendation work home possible. enforcing whole public sector. 

- allowing bars restaurants open late. 

- public gatherings 50 people. 

- Mask use public transport well bars restaurants seated. Exactly, knowledge power, yet U.S. leadership decided followers handle truth, would panic, lied everyone.



Taking needless risks bravery, pure ignorance. Yes, global warming, reddit certainly science-based.

You wrong. I'm living fear girlfriend nurse matter time. buy n95 bag gold city certainly fresh one every day her. That's like utopian fantasy nurse could get enough masks live America.

I kind wish it'd happen sucks freaking every time get headache wake feeling off.

We've lucky far best terms safety basically potentially exposed every day means also. us supposed every day another day get better treating it.

Still kind want punch ticket done freaking least get get lucky. Ehhh, health experts blinders impacts lockdown. Nobody relying single source advice information...decision makers redditors alike. almost appears think everything disinformation truth exist well defined slit. I. Reality grey lot common black white. Thanks! Population Density one factor many. COVID hammering countries less urbanised New Zealand. America first, Netherlands second! went wearing mask today saw like two people wearing mask. Everyone else without mask story matches current research people peak infectiousness day *before* symptoms onset. Cancelling plans someone feel sick well, super-spreader event likely take place someone feeling perfectly fine time. 

I feel important shame people made mistakes, owned them, talking mistakes benefit others. Anybody end wrong echo chamber due bad luck lack judgement, clearly someone already assigned blame anyone commenting story could, telling story might actually influence people position. need fight it. restrictions place years end. Quote that. I'm sorry, deluded think otherwise.

The psychological impacts COVID-19 mean new normal; least worse society. social safety nets exist would need pay left unemployed, it’s obviously large extra cost pay salaries prevent becoming unemployed.

If still jobs go back to. Buisness costs wages. wait serial killer epidemic deranged children grow up. *that's* awkward.  short answer, least based prior experience, Europe better short-run, medium-term America rapidly overtake recovery due dynamic employment market made improvements Covid business practices \[ie, hybrid work\]. way food ""shoved"" people?

Subsidized exactly?

People us access information weight loss? living rock? go look, handwashing much better evidence masks preventing spread viral infection. Mask RCTs general population (as opposed HCWs) can't even reject null hypothesis.

It's rather curious people ask intrusive questions act bossy handwashing, act imperious ever masks. they'll completely calmed person wearing loose mask washed week (if ever). 

I support public shaming still inexplicable. Almost people follow headlines emphasize instead double checking interventions real weight. That’s get inhale microchips (nanochips??) directly brain. Nice try people come crap like nearly always liberal arts graduates like *idea* science, see way win dinner table arguments boomer family members.

Science, people, means end. science say exactly want say, dismiss using exactly arguments global warming deniers. Mask good go. COVID ravaging suburban rural areas. New Zealand succeeded response luck geography. biggest lesson learned weight loss everyone needs find works them. people cut carbs great. Others try fail. gave meat eat lot vegetables, legumes, beans. people may give meat switch carbs. We're influenced worked friend think even unrealistic lifestyle change. Well, opinions aside, promise controversial. Google ""Great Barrington Declaration"" see controversial is.

My personal opinion: indeed result deaths. Straight up. something live great quality life people? I'm sure. 

Of course allow things like society, right? speed limit 10mph, would less people die car crashes? Absolutely. general, economy would suffer, quality life would suffer, frankly worth it. think basically everyone reading agree.

Would go (relatively healthy) population kill fuck people? Sure. Would mean community general would get general immunity. Probably. know juice worth squeeze.

Anecdotally, guy works covid right now. tested positive Tuesday. far good. headache Thursday, otherwise he's quarantined (will least ten days) asymptomatic right now. He's like 25, great shape, seems like big thing him. check twice day, day tell boss he's doing. everyone's experience like going, certainly I'd agree declaration. Right now? dunno. bad “in hindsight”? bad time. Pretty much retail-available N95s already bought time came say don’t wear masks (either aware Americans Chinese people asked buy ship China). also discouraged homemade masks despite lots prior studies concluding effective nothing.

I remember getting stupid reddit arguments back people anti-mask (before thing) main argument “the CDC said so.” motto party bit optimistic people sub love schadenfreude ... agree Dinner totally okay do. say Reddit.

Well, shit. Reddit lied me. Seatbelts airbags great things effective within certain speed limits. imagine similar relationship masks, distancing, lockdowns respectively. There's certain extent masks distancing sufficient. example reason didnt shut schools lack education serious consequences long run society individual children. 
 
There would fear Sweden habit letting children take PISA test, thus stats serious consequences. Hospitalizations deaths lot lower March April. We’re seeing massive spikes Europe right major rise hospitalizations deaths. Unfortunately, politicians still treating virus like it’s March. know exactly mean. eventually got it. took couple medications giving bad side effects find right one. guess, question is, asthmatics treated drugs asthma? many questions. CDC wanted mandate wearing masks public transportation white house said no.

no masks, lockdowns, nothing current US policy

football stadium Florida maximum 65,000 capacity

this fine want know place measures changed time, easy follow them, people trust actions authorities?

Sweden dumbfounds friend; even asked kindly provided mask, decide to, saying necessary keep distance, know enough closed unventilated properly ventilated spaces. course power complain insist, because, all, follow official policy. gay I'm I've lot life - food stamps Ferraris back again

Big red flags here.  Spain pure totalitarianism. Thank fuck didn’t stoop low US. Great news. Terrible username They'd think still hoax guy paid actor. Oh yes, let’s rely online anecdotes lolololol happy seeing Czech people getting sick?

Remember, ""all lives matter"" people. heartless grandmas killers Funny story this... taking kennis part inburgeringexamin (this knowledge part nationality test) time news broke women MPs wives voted husbands wanted to.

One questions test ""are women allowed vote Netherlands"" one answers ""yes, husband tells to"". sat laughing ass irony almost got tossed testing room. Masks effective extent magical. Distance effective extent virus measure distance go inert.

The one thing order stop Covid thinking properly … nurses heavy hand whole thread cute thought experiments. Combined 5% cfr estimated death rate case overwhelmed hospital services triage required ration ventilators Mask mandates don’t work one willing enforce them. business go mask mandates always handful people wearing masks. start lockdown vaccine released introduce vaccine badges. order outside home either present vaccine badge

Take medication dude. chilling article everyone read. it’s almost chilling fact richest country world STILL national response epidemic still control many states. easily biggest failure leadership we’ve seen generations deserved better PPE. NYC. mind boggling. deal kind crap everyday. Even without database, code/macros convert raw structured reportable data. whole piece pretty strange relies bizarre assumptions make sense goal life prevent infectious diseases (regardless severity) spreading, common-sense psychological viewpoint idiotic. suggests keep socially distancing prevent people getting flu: need heads checking think there's chance happening.

Then there's may case even presence vaccine still wouldn’t want pack conference rooms people like used medical conferences shake hands,” Safdar said. “I think behaviors likely going go away long term.”

As soon people think they're safe covid, they'll back original behaviour know it. You’re talking like Covid gone. Number deaths hinges well slow spread vaccine distributed whole population. It’s somewhat unlikely physically impossible could still hit number next summer, currently understood IFR. Brits took named city York. York originally named Eboracum Romans. vikings came, took city named Jorvik. time morphed York.

Human history never ending line people taking people's land. Yeah, that’s many died outside hospital... usually think it’s bad thought hits. Yes, third eligible, article notes ""But school districts qualify teach youngest children person aren’t yet planning so"". I'm trying figure driving increase. I'd put k-12 low list, sounds like pre-schools worth considering. “Funded Charles Koch”

Doesn’t mean it’s valid. swear, people Reddit think saying something like actual argument. It’s pathetic. 👍 video interview. hear saying things he's reported saying.

Unless trying imply video fake, matter reported it. fact official made comments. here. wife's great grandma visiting town soon started entertaining idea relaxing bit...but article scared right back common sense; worth it. easily meet outside chat staying distanced masked. still connect without engaging high risk activity (prolonged indoor exposure, sharing food, etc..). DAY ONE! Day fucking ONE, people - advice follow instruction national health officials. Period. 

When rest fuckwits started listening politicians talking heads set us present course. 

Pull head ass start listening made study things life’s work. Ignore everything else. Listen pros. 

My god. willful ignorance become badge honor. FFS.

Edit - downvote want. changes nothing. worry finding new link. Reddit issue links. happened 3 times another sub. Google title Chrome another browser. Hopefully outage last long. Exactly. stories promote dystopian “mask/social distancing forever” narrative writers get clicks views, “experts” get 15 seconds fame, cause conversation/controversy.

It always makes laugh people think society years humans meant social creatures long term would detrimental effects everyone. It’s already negatively affected millions people span six months. think work? spray get up? day day? getting people addicted? i'm vaccine also said *Listerine* would kill virus mouth throat works couple minuets true, restrictions yes, lockdowns extensively. Lockdowns emergency tools... It’s much parks, gas stations. joking? People wear masks time. Go outside. Everyone wearing mask. got used Well, say Reddit. anomaly. expecting flurry profanity hate because, like not, exactly Reddit best. appreciate respectful thought response. 

Scientists flying seat pants. point, understand that. exceptional time epidemiologist. needs common sense amid panic. Panic spread media. 

We knew sitting house months, knows even years, end would bad physically mentally. general population, included, willing take advise first scary time. facts numbers, it’s really hard support shutting everything staying prisoner house God knows long. 

With survival rates incredibly high vast, overwhelming number people contract C19 (over 99.9 percent), makes perfect sense protect need protecting letting healthy people get back regular lives. 

I’m going type manifesto means I’m doctor scientist need figure looks like implement it. take common sense little bit already learned (social distancing, even masks crowded indoor places I’m fine with) correctly. 

The hard part politicians media outlets social media. mold information see fit. 

Anyway that’s take it. /r/covid19 - Science moderated.

Also, one listen nonsense long wanting move on.

This second video I've ever put together [after though, I'd love critical feedback. goes way though. anyone know proposed reasons people inexplicably don’t get covid despite clearly exposed?

My girlfriend COVID close intimate day started symptoms (she started showing symptoms later night). got tested three times two weeks following didn’t get it. know similar situations well. research regarding could possibility? someone living Midwest currently, Netherlands still progressive us here. 

My friend's first day back uni Netherlands one kid wearing masks though, despite mentioning friends pre-existing condition wearing mask would appreciated. person wearing mask someone friend knew. supposed go back May. Ugh Im allowed donate blood anymore im much work isnt worth it. Thankfully common blood type. *vasovagal lose moderate republican supporters. made mistake swear unloading truck one heavily religious towns. actually called company rode barred going again.

Godverdomme. honest churches extremely large, sometimes 2000 people fit keep lot distance ventilation okay large outbreaks. probably fine. No...not all. already knew prior formulating opinion...the doctors describe ostensibly still much smarter contemporary ‘uncles drinking buddies,’ early medicine less effective make modern/science medicine wrong.

Understand? I'm betting read article guys arguing weird definition stuff. 

I'm guessing dude arguing since says lockdowns used ""to buy time reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources, protect health workers exhausted,"" that's ""condemnation"" lockdowns... disapproval primary means containment.

Your argument disapproval = condemnation, wrong.

Interestingly, made calculation 5 months ago based antibody tests done New York City time. finding 20% people city antibodies, versus 1% known/tested infections. 20% city already infected then, fatality rate calculated exactly Speak hard hearing deaf, instead voting real experiences people hard hearing deaf. inconsistent.

They're saying lockdowns still needed there's high rate spread, stabilized, lockdowns thing used combination less extreme lockdowns plus policies required help reduce spread.

Yup... pretty much. token woman MP. remember math back early March scientists saying 40-70% US would infected China’a death rate still 5%. low end, would 6.56 million dead Americans. I’m dancing around anything. I’m saying evidence meaningful scale. plural anecdote data.  I’m also saying posts bitching random yokels non-mask wearing aren’t appropriate topics sub. Wtf entirely point... ""Part life"" means indefinitely. indefinite, end. Soon. Like within year. People understand risk management all, scientifically illiterate think statistics gymnastic event.

Things never got control.

Urban areas taking turns running curves up, implementing restrictions, waiting things slow bit, reopen.

Rural areas slowly getting worse, lifestyles different whole lot less going much lower population densities, increases enough show national scale clearly.

When becomes clear, late.

I trying decide whether would rather cal near medium city, Illinois near Chicago hunker winter incoming political shit storm.

Obviously neither location ideal. I’ve mentioned posts related one.

I think we’ll start seeing lot “regional outsourcing. So, outsourcing different country, like India, different part US. example, company based SF, opening remote position. there’s qualified individual who’s based Kentucky, paid much less he/she would paid SF (because salaries heavily tied COL), individual going stand (also helps individual couple hours ahead, and, likely, speaks perfect English — I’m sorry, India). literally said average person would sent home literally dying. 

People don’t get hospitalized 5 days “out caution” aren’t sick Theoretically will, even case there's telling long could take. blood pressure spikes crashes point hospital thought heart stopping once. body goes completely haywire fucked. Ive never gotten flushot year effects me. super lame way is. lay reason effect much less severe. Deniers say ""Guess tougher 2 million dead people, finally return normal.""

Well. Yeah. evolutionary standpoint true. Survival fittest, right?

In hypothetical scenario EVERYONE AMERICA gets covid, people didnt die bodies resilient enough fight virus. saying ethically right wrong, reality, not? Sadly can't shut schools without giving working parents another option. can't afford skip work anymore. almost like social safety net made pandemic worse. thought Netherlands progressive place y’all sound backwards anywhere American South Midwest. definitely question idea “unquestionably good thing flu nasty thing suffer through” somehow evidence argument. utterly failed address OPs real questions instead basing answer conjecture derived subjective experience. Like... wow usually go “I don’t know anyone died plane crash obviously plane crashes fake news”.  article linked earlier 19/8 explains want recommend right Sweden. 

Considering rising fatigue compliance measures across Europe, without doubt contributed increase infection rates younger age groups, questionable adding extra measures needed would help long term lower compliance measures implemented. easier ignorant inquisitive. Lol can’t wait excuse get nasal vaccine. news? ppl reddit already true. see Bay Ridge Dyker Heights time Oh yeah totally, he's bloody lucky nevertheless. Sidenote: let woman EU court slammed it. Poorest part poor country leads covid ad don’t give fuck social distancing others. Let sink. Same. SA illnesses I've seen friend works hospital food poisoning. refreshing see staff work coughing sneezing cubicles. sort reporting lab, remove results determined time period. lab identifier. don’t go line line case. first link. Near bottom flu versus Covid comparison. Necessary relative term - evidence seem indicate everyone wore masks every flu season would drastically reduce number infections, made decision (rightly, mind) worth it, especially since there's vaccine available usually fairly effective.

These guidelines 2018, delivery services common. 

And heard anyone calling universal mask usage pandemic. know that, think one vaccines got nasal spray thing years back. know mean know, know know know. Well, *example* exponential growth.

The definition explains general case, specific. definition exponential growth something like ""growth instantaneous rate change quantity respect time proportional quantity itself"". I'm saying everyone die eventually

on long enough timeline... wouldn’t admitted didn’t meet hospital criteria admission.

Bullshit. way republicans going let fatass die close election, would stepped admit hospitals don’t send people home deathbeds critically ill Covid

Cool story bro, said? appeals apparently partial - Supreme Court refused hear attempt overturn appeal. Problem Montana Soo many people believe covid exists Soo frustrating . county live gets regulations come Monday cause covid gotten hand . County health department gave people week try get cases lower turn people protested cases even higher :(. Walked Walmart weekend wearing mask seeing half employees even wearing mask covering nose . Good read. would say no. Singular steriod. blocks leukotrienes. take allergic asthma. Unless Covid causing pathway inflammation, effective way reduce inflammation. need govt officials tell us fast drive wear pants public? 

LOL get real you? ... aware economy affects lives addition quality life, right? Like know economic collapse certainly lead death suffering overall virus sub 1% mortality rate? steps we’ve already taken starve millions people death developing nations. Halting global apparatus extremely dangerous thing done emergencies. really one shot we’ve spent it; literally *cannot* try again. 

But hey, least impoverished people aren’t dying COVID, right? putting vaccines air make children gay frogs!!!!! happened sister result cold. cold virus got ear infected...I forgot called wrecked auditory pathways one ear. cannot hear ear. See, America's place idiots. Numbers lie worry, President says totally control.

Anyway, [here's 9 months Trump's lies coronavirus 5 ""Senior White House adviser Anthony Fauci said Thursday death toll coronavirus could closer 60,000 Americans, assuming full social distancing, rather previously projected 100,000 240,000 deaths.""

Geez. Compare CDC predicting 300,000 dead end year pretty obvious badly government fucked up. Hey, probably little weird asking this, maybe insensitive, cancer going? Hope you’re great it’s treated. 放屁五毛 Districts WI well. Totally shady. Jesus fucking christ Swede got high position now. Depending medicine. feel like got punched arm Rock. admit using alt accounts sub yet mods continue allow it. 

That’s suspicious 🙄 think reasoning behind word choice fact less people hesitant use comparison actual vaccine come out

of course effective vaccine, people would willing get medicine

poor journalism indeed though, gotta get coin somehow People think look actual research.

Clearly case. possible reason think this?

_By definition_, half world IQ less 100. alt, torrent main account pretty obvious ..... part world, people get 5, 6 hours cloudy day light winter. High altitude means sun light less strong winter.

Government came today restaurants shops remain open new measures announced monday, limit social contact.

But I'm doubtful work. problem government bunch corrupt crooks people zero trust them. fact keep changing measures contradict time help. Thanks I’ll find another Assuming model accurate, sure. it? number people hospitals tiny fraction get it. Idk man like precedent government aerosoling chemicals body regardless consent? 

Lol thread reminds time guys like idea duterte's forced labor people wear mask whatever lol got flu shot nose year, dealing ton side effects! Don’t recommend Source problem extreme number infectious virus. Washing reduces factor 100, 1000 best, robust surface.
That nearly enough. Worst case washing sink re-aerosolise virus. experiments coloured dried saliva back spring. gets everywhere, visible proportion stayed food wiping.

If saliva mucus titers sth. like 10^3 TCID50 per ml something like that, problem, 10^7. half-life consumption crucial prevent infection.

Also, study realistic, food needs stay shelve month eaten raw. Masks, social distancing. two important tools eliminate thing. Well guess they're better people you. babies lol False person respond? 100% you. Thats showed Political leaning (more important highlighting Sensational, context headlines) think answer ignore news exclusively get updates level-headed folks r/coronavirus. Pretty sure face masks didn’t protect virus, stopped droplets leaving vicinity. virus dangerous deadly people get won’t feel anything won’t even know unless get tested. burried? Thanks u/_Hillary__Clinton_  First one behind pay wall. Regardless, since can’t read first don’t time read second, let rephrase “ALMOST” one world views lockdowns primary mitigation. Americans whining “locked down” beyond selfish. one locked down, “muh rights” valid argument you’re literally complaining needing wear something keep nasty secretions yourself. Shit IL even public schools aren’t telling parents outbreaks Often come sub see people actually care amount death caused virus. Happy see actually decent human beings don’t see normal Went downhill fast 3 seasons. Covid caused real survivors go downhill fast month 3, guess similar. brother exactly same, he’s scared anxious happy sit there, feints every time. makes sure he’s lying jabs Yeah. really sad I've noticed same. highschool crowd stay touch Facebook seem fleeing. Realistically generation entering workforce 2008 recession hit tell ton investors swooped bought much real estate. coupled completely irresponsible lack building new housing really 2012 there's way younger people see future actually involves property ownership. 

I working white collar job tech fiancee working large foundation. making reasonable salaries time living one bedroom suburbia saving little near would take drop payment million dollar 1300 square foot home. 

It's bummer. still love California miss tenable. many people coming technical training take high paying jobs everyone else getting priced out. COVID fuck around  Lockdowns work ensure high compliance. Hubei January April, Northern Italy March May.

In U.S. context, mainly lead resentment. 

I think would productive things like national news programs weekly nightly specials epidemiologists infectious disease doctors walked public *rationale* mitigation measures, like universal masking physical distancing public building interiors, testing contact tracing, travel quarantines. Maybe full math SIR epidemiology models, offering familiarity basic reproduction numbers (R0) effective reproduction numbers (Rt), interest could explain importance mitigation measures friends relatives.

I think middle ground Hubei Sweden. focus education encouraging residents think civic duty, financial subsidies non-essential businesses like restaurants theaters could continue business smaller scale outside well ventilated areas. Government purchases (and mandated production) N95 masks, distribution public, everyone could conduct essential errands high safety. 

It would required leadership, politicization, probably impossible hyper-polarized places like US, 30-40% live alternate media reality. countries faced decades partisan brainwashing, think middle ground lockdown abdication could worked. quarantine Chinatowns sections AMERICAN cities. Nancy Pelosi advocating Chinese AMERICANS unfairly discriminated virus’ origins.

Eating Chinese foods dangerous eating Italian Greek. people avoiding Chinese food probably brainiacs stopped purchasing Corona beer. Ironing mask washing way go. think much going survive minute two hot iron + steam. Dries much faster too.

But point article, brings great point. Masks disgusting full nasty shit wear them. wash mine nearly often sure many people guilty well. Definitely makes one wonder. Easier work someone who’s 3 hours ahead/behind, most, 12+ hours.

Also, accents still pretty thick. And, comes highly-skilled applicants, you’re likely better pool US, India.

Also also, especially comes kind work US citizen (e.g., aerospace defense industries). last time saw self-professed Christian acted like immortal soul peril? came vaccine. bad link Wisconsin hospitals peak. Winter going angry people entire life seeing obvious, empathy, and/or stupid.

Then realized basically expecting dog drive car. They're capable stupid expect it. [**Dr. Birx warning resurgence much ""herd immunity"" narrative, guess. Skeptics used excuse ""they seen first wave yet"" justify south's second peak. upticks Northeast (not mention Madrid Paris, among European regions) put stop that. 

When ever learn?? drop sky population Makes sense, sample bias way that's happens. visuals war.

This going disconnect people other. good comes knowing status getting keep medication allows fuck around, right? inhale vaccines? new this? Shocking It’s kids, it’s challenging everyone. studies kids effected stuff like hurricane Katrina show bounce back fine. Freedom places spike **after** prematurely relaxed regulations. France stuck plan little bit longer, France like New Zealand China right now. used get drunk giving plasma, always trick pass sensational headline. Nothing new lockdown last measurement... “The time believe lockdown justified buy time reorganize, regroup, rebalance resources, protect health workers exhausted, large, we’d rather it.”

So lf use: ""protect health workers exhausted"" ""reorganize"" maybe Western World use localized lockdowns (many countries try implement useful rules guess) china (maybe india?) act drasticly past agree US ruined world spanish flu, HIV h1n1? depends sample study setting, since places majority people symptomatic others reverse. still doesn’t state international borders need opened. Tourism industries make lot money local national tourism also.



Edit: spelling... voice text hates today.    Australians actually even draconian Chinese. Australian government virtually placed entire apartment blocks house arrest, refusing even allow anyone leave weeks. food supplies provided government. Muslim eat pork, bad. Ah yeah lemme snort vaccines Gay sought shelter orange one. wonder still supports that. Racism trumps everything guess aggravates won’t know true toll until/unless political party believes science back charge. Oh can't go church week! I'm gonna forget decent human being! Taiwan one first get actual good containment process successful it. sure sarcasm trying take So, Mr. Nabarro suggest sure-fire way get rapidly rising case numbers control?

Because quote helpful ""I would suggest getting Covid-19, fun disease"". Okay I'm refuting that? annual vaccines flu, sometimes work sometimes don't. 

We going annual covid vaccine quite time, even improvement therepuetics Israel lift restrictions lockdown imposed drive massive case swells September, massively successful. 

Arizona saw 75% decrease cases statewide mask mandate. Lockdowns last resort, continue occur long people flaunt rules. 

Must suck wrong. Speaking thing article literally about... Fewer cases sure would still potentially real bad time remaining 50% population vaccinated. infectious pneumonias typically spread? Reddit rules sweetie, conservative shit hole. Site wide. Again, can't wait meet next incarnation. Still though, what's Swedish trolls?  shocker lol. Hard pass. top claims medications used treat virus made President mentally unfit. though. People recklessly encourage others engage behavior gets others sick. jumps chain transmission eventually hits someone vulnerable. telling apply standards. Yeah proves masks work.
Although agree one point limiting social contact Yeah, let's explore every where. I'm advocating looking around everywhere.

The PRC good place look since first recorded major outbreak. remember months ago, right Disney World reopened check flightaware 20+ flights day Toronto Orlando alone. Excess deaths Texas well 6K pnumonia alone. see people wearing masks locked down? understand supporters watch straight lie still think savior humanity. could’ve seen coming... kind facetious actually. post, OP said afraid vaccination venipuncture, described fear, literally described venipuncture. Either way they're going afraid, trying alleviate fear, letting know. knows, maybe they'll afraid now! :P   Wash vegetables dishwashing soap infused 5% ammonia.
If virus survive that, hell it. Posting cynical replies Reddit, obviously. Yes opposed jumping conclusions assuming place identified first cluster originated.

You realize first cases backdated mid November Wuhan detract point places world undetected cases around time. Especially virus high asymptomatic rate resembles flu. ones France even travel history China meaning community spread undetected time. wastewater results Italy two cities. alone draws question origin. Yes Wuhan wet market hundred metres Virology lab. virology lab guy prosecuted 18 months making $1.5 mill selling animals used experiments meat wet market. Yeah great time open football stadiums tho days gone want avoid unnecessary deaths here. Lots evidence improper interference agencies. That's happens squander reputations institutions short term political gain. Ireland live, work, shop, etc...

I'm even sure what's locked here.


Restaurants packed, stores packed, malls open, gyms open, schools open... from?  thats Legend starts sad thing doctors probably believe you...but nothing People depressed incapable sacrifice. that? 39 years neoliberalism killed solidarity. Nobody gives f$£¥k.  Since shared link multiple times, become spam. Wow. don’t really think it’s problem, they’re probably fine probably don’t care opinion. it’s definitely huge problem society people mindset seem majority. made point me. never ends people Pretty sure it’s voluntary? type appeal longer empirically possible era Facebook though. many people intention ever applying critical thinking.  words Margaret Thatcher (Reagan would've said brains turned mashed potatoes) ""There's thing society"" country ruled bunch arrogant, self centered, unqualified, compassion, racism white fuck. Yes, things exist Netherlands it’s nearly prominent America wear faceshield step house mask Europe keeps rising (some countries ahead) lot countries simply can't afford second lockdown. bad. Here's latest case/death charts Nevada, running 7-day 54.68 deaths per 100k population. ranks 20th per capita Lockdowns alone work unless weld people homes. Jesus says love neighbor! guess Corona love time it’s not. condemn lockdowns all. Huh, bible verse basically legalized monarchy. Neat. No. don’t recommend primary tool Covid friend mine works Hogeschoolm Rotterdam, university applied sciences Rotterdam. Two days ago received e-mail wearing masks school, basically instead underlining people wear them, list situations need wear them. short, wear mask communal corridors; inside classrooms, offices, meetings rooms, want to, keep 1,5m distance... apparently still seems solution everything Netherlands. Horribly outdated policies ignoring recent research around wearing masks prevention, opinion pushed financial/economical reasons. disgrace really, also compared experience schools universities countries.

As result, friend, teacher, meet dozens students wearing mask. relatively young, still somewhat risk. can't nothing ask kindly people wear masks coming encounters, many students want, one either, complain teacher asking wear mask. course, don’t want disease world.

But means:

- international travel 
- interstate travel (b/c I’m NY State)

- school young kids

- concerts

- sporting events

- movie theaters (again, NY)

- social gatherings

- masks public forever


Then, yeah - I’d rather live world COVID flu. 

I mean, could take mandates weeks... even months... we’re coming year end sight. large percentage life means suffering rules, no... that’s want live.

I want kids go school! want travel Florida see grandma. want travel Canada see brother, niece, nephew. want birthday party kid. can’t endure much longer. US going regional waves. NYC starting see uptick. continues, would 2nd wave. places already hit hard within states. Louisiana Chicago 2 waves, example I’m fucking glad government doesn’t sick dogs people going jog Here's latest heat map showing per capita deaths across heat map showing hot zones - deaths mapped 7-day per capita list states, ranked per capita   scientists warned past. much humanity versus nature life. especially viruses, bacteria germs, unfortunately :(

we keep fact numerous people claimed reinfected

Not Again, 8 16. 8 22.

Yes, 8 50% 16. No, 22 cases 16 8 50% 22. No, can't. information given.

Really irrelevant. You’re harping minor point. cases didn’t change, number commenting on. According don’t count why’d say 22 cases? really understand immune system. Immunity reinfection protection disease. 

I removed term protective immunity uselessly debating semantics it. seems deterred that. Sure is. basis entire rehashed argument. read somewhere long lasting cellular immunity coronaviruses assumed protective immunity. not.

No actually. argument there’s reason think reinfection present dire problem. bit late that? Well even superspreader events, people might close enough ""patient 0"" that's highly contagious. example Rose Garden superspreader event White House, 150 people attendance, maybe ~25 know, sickened. majority sickened. verge though NYC.  would argue Italy did.  didn’t enough beds sick people required bed ventilator lot people died could lived beds them. opening field hospitals dont enough staff, healthcare system collapsing.  

CollApse “ hospitals filled”. It’s people triaged deemed sick left die. happened southern states people shipped hospitals 100s miles away didn’t capacity. No, said frozen fresh food technically American. difference hypocrite. apply standard X others, also apply standard X ourselves. Looking deaths cases seems like bad.  shame lack sympathy compassion either directly indirectly suffering time. numbers rigged... direction deniers claim... safety everyone! need jobs got government! live area cases since May LTC facilities still heavily locked down. plans reassess restrictions residents workers vaccinated. Ireland = 4,900,000 people

42,000 positive cases

1,824 deaths. That’s good added perspective. can’t imagine give birth alone hospital worrying baby. :(

Though think feels little different old people nursing homes them, isn’t temporary. could last year lives, they’re spending alone. daughter (hopefully!) survive get sort normal existence family someday, whereas elderly may not. Agreed. U.K. government seems think coming trite sayings (like “stay alert”) enough. Disinfectant vaccines two different things probably going eliminate it, eventually reduce number hosts reduces opportunity mutation. However also much controlled viruses genome, seems strange Florida, Georgia list. open almost everything. Yup! 

Honestly naively took bait years, took long time see it. joined facebook 2007 merely presented recent grads networking opportunity. Much like LinkedIn now. Religion encourages idiocy anywhere. people ready normal life think.

Add list. Normal life involve people running around infecting 2% paying life another 10% suffering long term. Might normal whatever echo chamber live in, normal. possible don’t know run pivot table? Absolutely agree time added research issue. seeing people wearing face Shields masks. Oh no. Isnt Chinese said along? don’t like penetrated lol hate needles enough refuse injections, great news! Yeah NM. live pretty close largest hospitals state life flights certainly increased. can’t afford lockdown always method Covid vaccine would take. makes ""Bill Gates wants inject tracking chips!!!!"" hysteria hilarious. one people supposed move Canada four years ago? See authority like, cruel others, love passage. US Brazil top 10 per capita deaths. true.

Shame spoke called us naive.

Here results naivety. people seem ready live normal lives someone close fall ill die. cognitive dissonance anything. course understandable, surprising many people understand normal crisis is....not likely. UK recorded 12,872 coronavirus cases 65 deaths latest daily government update.

On Sunday... EU study, trump paddle disinformation like do. glad someone else said it. used Mist till report came 2016 saying work. Ever since needle Flu shots.  think talk virus less lethal conservative talking point lol think talk virus less lethal conservative talking point lol Indirectly. Think like dick. Lol always economy coming Covid deniers running arguments getting bad.... True, wherever goes hope still get one liners. say mutations may make virus contagious necessarily make deadly, necessarily inhibit effectiveness potential vaccine. really unreliable adjusting findings information Learned new virus ONE ones much about. 

If reliable source WHO, point ?  thing is, within scientific disciplines, crest theories based information adjust theories data confirms denies theories.  

So. Yes. wrong before, changed based new evidence. It’s stark contrast anti-maskers still hold onto first evidence cloth masks didn’t help. evidence shows really effective stopping slowing spread contradicts belief it’s fake. ""I listen science"" one worst reddit lies.

Yes, global warming, reddit certainly science-based. That's true. actually gender dysmorphia trans? Suddenly reddit thinks that's bad follow science anymore.

Covid? science says something that's bad current dipshit president, believe it. science could support moron says?  Suddenly need remember science process look critically, blindly accept it, etc. 

It's amazingly tiresome. late convince people wear masks minds made. Trump convinced wear them. Singapore dictatorship got away banning chewing gum.  Škodolibost.

The main problem populist government awfully inept controlling pandemic (they basically beneficial ruling party short-term vision) many people dislike government (and deserves disliked) hate ignore everything government decrees, including (late half-assed) attempts someting pandemic. 

Add mix lots popular TV experts claiming us ""just flu"", internet propaganda (we popular facebook groups like ""With humor face masks"") general denialism tired whole pandemic media coverage. probably going break soon awful trajectory, damage done.

By way, also another word - ""pohoda"". state things everything sort cozy, easy okay-ish, without need exert oneself. state mind well suited deal serious problems. someone interferes pohoda called ""buzerace"" (faggoting), whether government, EU, attempts mitigate global warming road speed limits.
Knowing two words important understanding many voters succeeding local politics tell lot pandemic response... tell us zoom happy hour you’re blue face: don’t fucking care. People want live lives. Time deal. ban writing anything “negative” Trump. Literally argued nepotism. Told monarchs employ children administration. 

But maybe like Trump. info, contact tracing means persons contact without protection 15 minutes more. 10 persons, considered cluster. constantly posted here? june numbers time low, outside sunny weather. event zero effect spread coronavirus. Definitely bottom five Germany, tried distancing + masks + low number infections + ""have nice holiday"" + ""thanks bringing Covid back"" + ""let's ignore distancing mask rules"" + ""why numbers infections rising again"" + lot whining new ""lockdowns"" aka. closed bars travel restrictions. City employees residents, semantics game. vaccine approved, even emergency use only, end year, say back 99% normal later end June. events first half 2021 may cancelled due lead times uncertainty; but, guess April start see things feel like old times. assure almost nobody Latvia Estonia Finland wanted live Sweden year. Zero sympathy. late wear masks? it’s not. Masks didn’t magically lose protective power trump didn’t convince people. learned walk dead? businesses live do. make stink could lose job, can’t afford. Uhhh. Thats dawg Yeah berries another thing hard wash. best. risk probably low.   wouldn’t agree that? Seems uncontroversial. Agree. article dime dozen lol

Aside masks, things already feeling pretty normal still long ways away vaccine. let’s crop dust Whitehouse! waste money people wear properly wear wear wrong kind mask thought paranoid ironing masks!  That's upcoming elections rollout lot easier."
