I hope keep pace get shitty situation. information trials wasn‚Äôt publicly available, wouldn‚Äôt take vaccine all. Science must transparent freely available all. Australia getting 50 cases week (with pre travel PCR testing).  let 5,000 per week.

Olympics = 15,000 athletes officials, call 150 cases without vaccine.  Assume vaccine 90% effective, you‚Äôre importing 15 cases.

There‚Äôs much covid still.  Vaccines amazing. Cases plummeting high vax countries time Olympics held.  US, Israel UK safe, Olympics include lot people countries outbreaks still ongoing abd barely vaccines handed out.  it‚Äôs almost certain imported cases.  allow 100,000 overseas spectators it‚Äôs guaranteed.

They're already working second generation vaccine's specifically [targets 
 
I'm quite sure reason vaccines right target death, back February March 2020 conceived developed, everyone freaking killing us all. Yes 1% figure there, people *feel* sure. reason streets empty late March April, harsh lockdown seen since, people know make virus. knew could kill afraid. generated compliance. started set ~1% people die realized 1% meant personally, started saying ""forget - I'm going out"". sort empty streets like saw back April since. 
 
That moment time, everyone actually scared dying, prevalent labs Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J too. mean, *knew numbers*, entire context pandemic framed fearful way death. somewhat hysterical zeitgeist, made vaccines mind. 
 
But course preventing deaths hugely important thing. 500,000+ deaths obviously horrible. I've said start need frame virus really - virus maims body, sometimes kills you. Waaay people getting hit virus getting hurt die.  
 
When framed thing kills you, come realize age-group puts .2% chance death, going comply strict public safety. told people start scars people's lungs, cause long-term brain damage, heart problems, even reduce male fertility. Even asymptomatic cases. 
 
 
 framed wrong start ""solution"" fix expected year ago began adventure. thought suck vaccine came, everything would go back normal. 
 
Well they've telling us **no going back normal**, learn **live virus**. exactly mean? means vaccines end virus. case study BC great fucking initial case study exactly means. Thank y'all, came this. one, enough doses vaccinate 7 million day. run buffer stocks, also enough send countries. August, enough doses remove self imposed rate limits. wut? Re: edit, that's exactly J&amp;J bot would say. sus. Came ask same; title totally misleading.

It's fine compare different decisions different bodies neither ""following"" other. gotten sick past year? Cold, flu, ect?

CDC telling Israel do, health officials Israel agreeing health officials US. makes sense preventing death would first thing address, p much miraculous several vaccines produced less year prevent death near 100%. absurd factor makes everyone think ‚Äúok we‚Äôre done!‚Äù

It may actually preventing transmission difficult many reasons would effectively rewrite humans physically interact keeps, it‚Äôs clearly done past year. simply isn‚Äôt sustainable long term.

Another factor may messaging, curious. became clear death rate wasn‚Äôt high initially seemed, particularly among younger age groups, persistent shift idea long-term damage even mild asymptomatic infections, fact quarter plus infections may result long-term illness. seemed like weird balancing game things dangerous socialize ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù still safe enough go work/shop.

Another false statement production site UK evidence circumstantial proof existing partnership indication lipids EU came Merck Evonik all. thing find Pfizer entered partnerships recently early February, before.

In contrast, reports Croda lipid Pfizer regardless production sites media. I'll let people make will. Hope CA soon... Assuming false positive rate 0.1%, yes would register 100 positive cases 100k uninfected people.

The false positive test rate depends specificity assay, varies widely based test method reagents used. overall false positive rate therefore hard accurately quantify.  orders, fucking orders. UK refusing export anyone, anything export, vaccines paid produced using facilities paid for. EU invest billions, invested seven times less UK, facilities already existed privately funded. UK basically funded establishment scratch. That's difference. 28MM would add another 8.5% American public.

It depends overlap. 50% 8.5 % get vaccine that's +4.25% USA COVID infections country world. lucky none mutations spawned domestically America contagious variant? seems contagious variants started countries fewer infections (UK, South Africa, Brazil). insane. Jesus, hope public scientific literacy among journalists low? research published New England Journal Medicine found *engineered version virus*, containing mutation carried spike protein highly contagious P1 variant first identified Brazil, effectively neutralised *among people given jab*.

So we're infecting general public engineered strains COVID now, we?

The PR getting people get vaccine would outweigh headlines. know he's survived much much worse headlines. lived idaho 5 months year spent significant amount time wyoming. People never wearing masks begin with. Spiderman meme Curevac company I'm aware made effects non-neutralizing antibodies animal trials public. probably thought Hoskins effect/original antigenic sin well, even since aim broadly working vaccine next year.

Just reading lines press releases testing December January, guess experience strategy consultant decade ago vaccine companies caught guard E484K.

So would bet lockdown-free next winter, least update trials results in. Alternative would decent mass rapid testing strategy, see chaos there. Ok thank you! Nice need cure economic collapse least honest asshat. I'm sorry others peoples deaths inconvenient you. Yayyy !

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  kinda funny, even though vaccinate lot slower, also got people fully vaccinated got desease here... false positive rate work covid tests (testing positive covid)?

I know low let's say current tests 0.1% rate, mean 100k tests world covid never existed, we'd get around 100 positive cases? T. Mental health wise huge! **The vaccination covid-19 already seems led reduced corona mortality Sweden, SvD's compilation shows.**

**- expected, says epidemiologist Jonas Bj√∂rk.**

**Just two** months ago, vaccination covid-19 began Sweden. According Swedish Public Health Agency's latest statistics, 600,000 people since started vaccination, half time receive two doses vaccine.

In first vaccination phase, priority given people elderly care certain care staff. SvD's compilation shows vaccination already seems begun effect statistics.

Among things, number deaths terms number confirmed cases infection decreased recently.

**During November,** December January, relationship two measures fairly constant. time, usually 60-70 confirmed cases infection corona-related death, considering many tested positive two weeks date death.

For example, almost 100 deaths per day occurred end December, middle month, approximately 6,500 people tested positive every day, corresponds 65 positive cases two weeks earlier per death.

But looks different.

( figure ratio mortality confirmed cases - ) 
( figure confirmed cases elderly homes - )

**In mid-** February, instead 110 positive cases corona death according measure. indicates covid-19 mortality may halved since vaccination began.

What relationship death rates infection rates looked like last two three weeks unclear lag statistics number deaths.

Another sign vaccination effect number cases nursing homes plummeted recent weeks.

During second wave, approximately two percent new cases infection occurred nursing homes. last week February, 40 new cases discovered country's homes, corresponds 0.15 percent confirmed cases week.

**Cases** home care service also decreased, much.

Jonas Bj√∂rk, professor epidemiology Lund University, says development surprising.

\- expected, reasonably effects starting seen now, says SvD.

But warns excessive optimism. Even though mortality rate covid-19 thus seems decreased, relatively high spread infection society may continue lead large number seriously ill people high burden healthcare near future.

\- death rates. seen admitted hospital tend little younger before. remembered large parts risk groups 70-plus general yet full vaccination protection.

**Recently, the** question possible shutdown society debated. mainly due fact government prepared law make measure possible, Center Party's leader Annie L√∂√∂f called [closing parts two three weeks curb infection.

Jonas Bj√∂rk says finds difficult decide whether stricter restrictions necessary not.

\- measure based death toll, wanting avoid many risk groups becoming seriously ill. case, probably stupid start letting go restrictions soon.

**The Swedish Public Health Agency wrote** report last week estimated take months vaccination's effect total spread infection becomes really noticeable.

State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell warned several times risk third wave great. Sunday's SVT Agenda, however, said increase recent weeks number newly confirmed cases extensive previous infections.

\- upswing Sweden, dramatic. much calmer Christmas saw dramatic increase. obviously added restrictions added always effect, said Anders Tegnell. vaccines work S. Africa variant, less well. cases, less well (Astra-zeneca). know Modena Pfizer yet real world.

Honestly dude vaccines need cheer like sports team. data data. Ultimately, think they're going keep secret. probably want patent protection, requires publishing details publicly.

But custom technology invented custom manufactured. people manufacture already contract make equipment them...

I think Moderna Pfizer believe pharmas replicate faster scale up. There's couple things need know Israel.

1. We're far 'conservative' comes possible loss life, change current status general. Inertia playing big part decision.
2. There's whole lot anti mask movement here, never anti mask protests actually believe work (many know care).
3. Mask mandate seriously enforced.
4. Cases still relatively high (3.6k/day weekly average), even deaths severe cases dropping.

It's mix inertia accepting small price mask lower cases/severe cases much more, usher normality.

Now actually answer question, think it'll happed severe cases drop hundreds current 700, deaths drop single digits. We're talking 4-6 weeks estimate.

People slowly wearing less less, certain threshold met, gov would drop mandate officially. Hi Brazil.

In retrospect virus likely already circulating US rest world much earlier first started seeing confirmed community spread. People keep acting like two categories overlap. People also getting vaccinated. Smart fellow get 24 hours straight flu symptoms got taking it? whole eye storm, fourth wave thing seems less less likely. also people zero symptoms. Unless everyone population tested regular basis, semi-educated guesses percentage infected people asymptomatic throughout infectious period. also percentage false negative tests! friend mine ton Covid symptoms including difficulty breathing, bad cough lasted weeks, loss taste smell. never developed normal symptoms always gets every time cold. could been? got negative Covid test middle it. took months sense smell taste come back, developed weird unfamiliar kind exhaustion tons people report developing following recovery Covid. even say Covid tests certain percentage reliability (different numbers depending who's reporting it) sounds bit unreliable used definitive statistics. people suspect Covid decide isolate couple weeks they're already working home easier go walks put grocery trip couple weeks rather making appointment first available one THREE WEEKS, calling every day see appointments opened going person place every day see squeeze without appointment, thus spreading suspected Covid germs around community every time that. could exponentially mild moderate cases ever know. think hospitalization numbers really useful statistics Covid transmission. end, need tackle Covid differently common colds flu much higher hospitalization death rates anyway. long we're spreading incubating around community creating new strains it, we'll keep seeing hospitalizations, absolutely focus EVERYONE following whatever protocol keeps spread down. I'm scared Americans get comfortable terrifyingly higher death rates every year compared already far high death rates flu year. always wear mask public feel cold might coming in, return work feel bit better know we're totally yet (most jobs U.S. fire take 3 days row without doctor's note saying horrible illness). I'm sure start that. Instead Americans get comfortable much higher death rates infectious diseases every year. ""It's 500,000 year that's better 2020 everything's back normal masks ever yay!"" read details, see comparing two different time periods significant difference age population groupings. study (not peer reviewed yet) adjusted results. questions around adjustments.

Israel much better source. need adjusting data. results show real world (unadjusted) impacts Pfizer outperforming clinical trial 95% efficacy. suggest AZ outperforming Pfizer appropriate. level mitigation individual government. Almost everyone taking extra precautions. 

The government isn‚Äôt seeing entity, don‚Äôt set bar much spread acceptable far morals/ethics concerned. aren‚Äôt connected. It‚Äôs suddenly moral, CDC said indoor gatherings fine day ago compared last week said wasn‚Äôt.

Advanced purchase contract, section 5, item 5.1. Dates quantities redacted; however, fact supposed 80 million doses end Q1 public knowledge point. Even that's bit iffy... Cali 15th country testing per capita. Florida 25th. Therefore FL probably quite bit undercount. Let suggest that, possible, move somewhere less nasty endemic diseases! life saving; fuck, species saving; technology allowed kept secret? profit?

This hurts everyone. don‚Äôt leave Chicago land area.. bunch cynical assholes don‚Äôt give fuck anyone Getting Johnson Johnson Thursday! anyone know it‚Äôs safe take drive home? felt nothing. never feel anything flu shots either. even that‚Äôs really actually opposed states. There‚Äôs many ways Hawaii. Yep. Meanwhile Cali think lot people traveled holidays brought covid back. 

It's complicated. failed engage points repeated previous dismissive argument. worth time arguing people like you. disagree FDA it‚Äôs acceptable emergency use? also want FDA approve you‚Äôll take it...? think still can't issue civil criminal penalties noncompliance. suggestion point. Found virus one two days Wuhan locked down. never forget first time heard radio host mention drove home work. 

Proceeded feel like conspiracy theorist first week March, beginning become apparent actually real issue. date stands mind March 13th, discovered local grocery stores almost totally cleaned out. ‚Äúoh shit, bad might survive all‚Äù moment me. 

But everything Jan. 20th era COVID me, personally. Amazing happens leadership take pandemic seriously treat urgency vs making media making whole pandemic make look bad. working high end tourism industry Moorea, next island Tahiti. Water sports, scuba diving, sailing, snorkeling, water skiing, playing volleyball beach every afternoon. Dinner guests dancing night. 

I foreigner got working there, met ""now wife"" there. went back years later, wedding guess what? Yep, got again. one serotype Tahitian Islands. number new coronavirus infections Greece shot 3,215 Tuesday, according new data published National Organization Public Health new cases, 1,572 recorded Attica (from 556 395 Thessaloniki (from 108 Monday) 149 Achaia (from 79 total number tests conducted country last 24 hours amounted 60,038, positivity around period, 46 deaths Covid-19 recorded, total number fatalities reaching 484 intubated patients ICUs. is. 

The US donated 2.5 billion dollars. next seven donor countries addition direct donations, US threw billions dollars manufacturing enable doses made shipped overseas.

Yes, exchange money, US gets first dibs, think many people complaining want wait 2022 2023 get vaccine. hope advocating social distancing wearing masks, employers allow people work home whenever possible, essential workers given PPE need?   Gotcha.

Also, know sped Phases 1, 2 3 conducting time appose staggering them.

But yea, saying makes sense. able adjust timelines certain regards, hopefully large number participants provide experts better data easily obtainable. could have, heck know.... used $18 *billion* cash balance sheet?  That's horrible. problem kind ignorance near impossible ""cure"" vaccine improving science education schools. Unfortunately, I'm place vaccine appreciated either. Florida serious issues reporting accurate statistics

What's sense fellow Floridians dealt pandemic overall? ""Fake news / overblown / everyone said FL would slaughterhouse b/c Olds never materialized"", kinda like that?

in Texas started fake news / flu etc. time I'd say morphed something else. like ""Fine, flu. **God protect own** tough enough withstand it, probably real Texan along. people hurt shutting businesses virus"", &amp; forth really should, think 50+ final age bracket anyone uses. Looking CDC stats age, MASSIVE drop covid deaths 50 (like, twice many 40-49 year olds died 30-39 year olds, nearly 15x many 50-59 year olds died). really hope standard becomes 50+ soon, relatively brief pause (couple weeks?), focus shifts toward reducing transmission general, anyone/everyone get fast possible. I‚Äôm American l living Portugal. March 9th think Italy went lockdown freaked fuck out. booked flight back US airport hours later. figured better wait things parents‚Äô house since knew everywhere would soon locked down. I'm thinking May. I'm hoping I'll opportunity get vaccine sometime April, though. want many people healthy get put situation like complicated. 

Florida overall better weather, especially populated cities/counties near coast. 

California much densely populated counties (Los Angeles county alone 10 MILLION people... half population Florida one county)

California actually prioritized testing. 15th country cases per capita vs Florida 25th. Florida thus larger underreported case/death situation. 

The states different economies. Everything Tourism service industries different. 

The holidays example... larger population california means people traveling holidays coming back, likely bringing covid home vs exporting it. 

The shuttering businesses easier parts one state vs another vs parts state such. honest, lot things open california. restrictions terms occupancy, businesses open inside vs outside etc. 

All call, cali done pretty well vs rest country. 30th deaths per capita.  Remember... populated state country highly populated population-dense counties. insane. ""Henry said staff residents home offered immunizations high uptake vaccine. said cases among people received two doses vaccine."" 


So everyone vaccinated provide info status people tested positive long since second dose. LTC. homes full immunocompromised people important staff visitors vaccinated. can't extrapolated general public. trounced Covid huge % people giving up. generous yet. can‚Äôt afford stretch out. Add seasonality/ cyclical nature viruses do.  Ouch. idea global number low.  Right!!! 24/7 big cities.  live Texas agree you. still decent amount people taking precautions I'd imagine people (including myself) continue next month so.

Plenty people carrying COVID people continue Wednesday.

The thing happen tomorrow may get customers getting mad employees establishments still requiring mask. far COVID goes though, much difference, April think states businesses start easing restrictions vaccination numbers continue increase people realize mandating masks restrictions really detrimental. I'd say realistically could lose Covid. know people die survive catch it. many failed protect determine much lost over. I'd thought months I'd vaccinated March part essential workers comorbidities groups, late last month CT decided eliminate groups go primarily age-based. Huge kick teeth.

I'm trying jealous hard family zoom call older relatives bragging summer plans, meanwhile cancel can't call make appointment April.

This marathon someone added another 2 months end. Yeah, no. following Osterholm since pandemic started one, everybody, Fauci included, provided nonsense information really happening. mark predictions things headed, honest know. Fauci agree mean wrong. like Fauci lot, he's god. view impaired enough you‚Äôd consider able evaluate risks, likely either spouse caregiver anyway. 

To answer question, personally don‚Äôt care people 18 don‚Äôt wear belts, care drive impaired. effect others belts low, drunk driving high.  im starting doubt 140 million end march claim There's substitute time tracking people trials, though. reason traditional time issue mitigated phase 3 typically need time people trials naturally get whatever disease is. Since covid prevalent, speed part up.

There's speeding ""watch two three years"" Something always wondered... 

If someone virus, mean get vaccine vaccine hangover? Like, already mostly antibodies, no? January Stay hydrated fact left people gasping breath dying COVID complications met outrage compassion affected. Dehumanizing victims good look. I'd agree conclusions, way near 100% mask compliance subway. anywhere close 100% compliance rules jacking shitting pants. know making statement masks distancing factor, impossible realistically compare SD ND Chicago since population densities nowhere near similar. Obviously people living closer together going affect transmission disease. nebulous term. long term symptoms happen ten percent cases, heavily correlated hospitalization. downplay people feeling, rare get hospitalized disease experience least long-term sequelae state actually done good job despite vocal social media minority problem getting vaccine. Hopefully momentum continues Pfizer, AZ, Moderna what? side effects similar each?  Instead following total hositalizations, include people got infected weeks ago, consider looking daily admissions rate. gives better idea CDC also graph total current hospitalizations 15th read article somewhere promising signs treating long-haulers vaccine improved conditions. Sorry handy can't search ATM would surprise anxiety induced. Especially retired folks die off! Yay! appreciate contribution spread. I‚Äôm pretty sure fianc√©, son, December 2019. fianc√© never sick before, cough cough. got sick one night woke couldn‚Äôt breathe. freaking out, shooting pain across chest. never experienced pain like scary fuck. went hospital. told pulled muscle. told knew pulled muscle felt like it. took radiographs changes lungs. said maybe start pneumonia, wasn‚Äôt sure. sent home felt awful weeks. Sure. everyone go work grocery store. medical quality state much lacking. identified South African variant here. 

Time get popcorn. 6 months?  pay shots needed vaccines weaken? Yes. 600 deaths today. Definitely interesting, guess everyone interpretation situation. told us definitely try get everyone else house vaccinated wouldnt give one. Id feel like vaccination better nothing like said knows, im doctor haha.

Thanks hope going well too. Gonna long road starting hoping best know people similar experience. covid first shot seemed severe side effects expect second dose, whereas second dose present any, mild side effects. Lie thurs YK wrong. We're getting 53.5m doses 3.5m supposed produced internationally, lot less 550,000 doses going get 300,000 got EU stole us. don‚Äôt know percentages, personally know dozen people COVID. 

One passed others completely recovered. cases long COVID among them. I‚Äôve gotten swollen mildly sore lymph nodes vaccines. I‚Äôll report back ever get covid vaccine may awhile since I‚Äôm weak state that‚Äôs still beginning rollout hasn‚Äôt even gotten medically high risk people yet. Pfizr? hardly know her!

I‚Äôll see out. pickles gone man. ""summer low"" last year got 28k, without vaccines. expect vast majority hospitalizations older folks co-morbidities getting shots last months see us really knocking hospitalization number down.  luckily good news solution give everyone got J&amp;J vaccine booster (I would think?) ‚Äúgravitationally preferred?‚Äù fear forget us open flood gates everyone get vaccine. Cause it‚Äôs going even harder get one. really worry that. Two weeks slow spread hypochondriacs/health anxiety sufferers scared think they‚Äôre dying vaccine me? 

I going get vaccine soon can, I‚Äôm going nervous. take klonopin getting shot? things asking doctor? Lol someone help me. ‚ÄúMy students‚Äù. Implying professors teach. can‚Äôt imagine Canadians vaccinating eligible people live part-time homes Canada matter also live. Seems like decent thing there‚Äôs also self-interest factor involved. real Jack Johnson? incorrect. love China much, go live there. entirely true.

Only lab tests done Moderna Pfizer South African variant.

There six-fold reduction antibodies created, Moderna Pfizer claim vaccine still effective. I'm responding usage words ""mildly obese"" - care numbers used. point whenever use fizzy language (fluffy, pudgy, mildly obese) instead clinical language, make things worse normalizing obesity.

That point making. point think making. unable understand (after 3 posts) I'm talking about, maybe stop making many posts concentrate reading rather writing. :) would avoid people you. Stupid reasons ignorant people. time contagious variant widespread Houston, yet TX cases falling line rest country. variants overhyped doomsday fetish. Curious innit? Well dunno parents area every clinic pharmacy like CVS Walgreens even grocery stores going vaccines. 

Then public health drives volunteers super vaccine sites stadiums supply add staff.

The ability administer vaccines there. It‚Äôs supply short. Eventually patients short supply we‚Äôll drum hiding.  course, much serious grades. told anti vax co worker vaccinated people need quarantine exposure. Since kids class still can't get vaccinated, coworker fun literally teacher would need quarantine kids another positive kid. Haha Yes omg! sound similar us. Mid-thirties two daughters! Earlier went drive 7 year old crying passed stores said ‚ÄúIt one year since another building isn‚Äôt house‚Äù. felt super sad she‚Äôs aware entire year. üòî math wrong. That‚Äôs say. Early bird special. second year law school motivation thing legit right now. feel urgency get act together study online classes. I'm even competitive person world need kind environment get motivated. whole life I've always needed slap face reality check schoolwork make get together get staring screen day. Even undergrad, many would skip, would always attend class even required, even days paying attention, needed constant reminder face would lose track. even get feel motivated anything, especially classes based one final end semester. even know whats gonna happen next week chaos thats going last year yet I'm supposed laser focused bunch exams 4 months away, mental health deteriorating I'm learning anything.

My whole life I've tried avoid room laptop much know easily get distracted/lose focus literally cannot escape it. classes person allow laptops they're ""too distracting"" (even though classes allowed use I'd airplane laptop take notes Word) we're expected fully attentive computers day can't even turn WiFi stay focused. Legit spent years coming right study routines perfect (I still get pretty distracted even normal circumstances) pandemic threw wrench still figured way fix it. advice get ""go walk clear head!"" sorry, go far still work room computer interaction peers. I'd rather classes person+be able go library work (library near starting open consistently even limited hours) spend free time room (tbh decent amount pandemic) able go outside free time (as now) forced get work done room. productivity gutter can't get motivated.

Sounds terrible legit zeal/passion led go law school first place fizzled out. came usual naive visions going changing world thats hard keep I'm room staring screen eyes give out.  Seriously...why Maryland seem far behind?! frustrating us healthy middle aged! concert Red Rocks? Hey, mean sound like dick, want another go it? Interesting - page also notes derived effective R value Houston metro 1.0 last 7 days. Cuomo emergency powers taken away lol correct. understanding trial data good 3 months due timeline data (which sounds right J&amp;J trial participant - got shot Nov data reported Feb). means released official results past 3 months. likely immunity past timeframe. trials continuing study participants release findings I'm sure. go another blood draw May. cdc‚Äôs new guidance says fully vaccinated people mingle together indoors, unmasked without social distancing. also issued guidance vaccinated folks mingling low risk unvaccinated folks (like grandparents hanging grandkids).

These advisories lifting restrictions. It‚Äôs change. Whatever want call it. $$$$$ Doesn‚Äôt Germany side contracts Pfizer/BioNTech give access doses main EU contracts? live Alaska. Case rates won‚Äôt go ever mutates everybody :p sounds reasonable. ultimately, whatever infectious disease experts think best order, that's order done. problem is, seemingly agreement states order be? Currently grocery worker oregon, I'm eligible May 1st, considering difficult get appointments, actual shot could much later that. washington hand, essential workers become eligible March 22nd. bizarre. actually...the CDC says number cases US likely 4x number confirmed cases, around 120,000,000. life north eastern US seeing one going barely worth living...  ahhh thanks hard tell days Source?  mean Cartwright! Category agree. states lifting restrictions soon people likely get infected, happening. manufacturers willing guarantee three months immunity backed trials. could longer data yet.

IMO likely immunity lasts longer three months. J&amp;J one left - need tossed Everyone commenting vaccine experience, ya give advice here? I‚Äôm getting second dose Pfizer week, rather important event five days later (super important business presentation). going fucked event, good then? Googling ""texas medical center hospitalizations"" gave like things slight downward trend hospitalizations early December. UK variant going cause another rise hospitalizations, happened yet. Again, messaging CDC weird IQ test read lines. Either way said initial set guidance, expect data (aka less restrictions people get vaccinated) remember reading previously specific lymph nodes collarbone/armpit, bad news. 70% US population obese overweight. people lose pounds. Clearly inbetween ""itll take year get people stuff survive fucking 30 days"". People coddled nowadays. shared sacrifice like say ww2. sarcastic going places? There's many pharmacies parents' area. many Americans stroking dick. Yes live 3 months minimum. don‚Äôt evidence beyond yet. men experience fatal symptoms You‚Äôre nerdy sub. Chinese government disease spreading worse Covid. (NOT people. Chinese people victims gvt well.) Many teacher‚Äôs unions opposed opening, Democrats receive lot support unions. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre working deals unions behind scenes‚Äîhence push states prioritize teachers vaccinations. CDC director stating schools safe wasn‚Äôt right move put pressure teacher‚Äôs unions. think underestimate overlap folks skeptical vaccine really need $500. think you‚Äôd surprised vaccine uptake program. Whys link purple Thanks answer - good point case counts low. curious vaccines - I'm worried much serious bout COVID testing positive. vaccines prevent positive tests would still test positive get symptoms? known yet? Eh, somewhat similar you. Drank ate everyday work. Cutting made easier. And, you, challenge maintaining normal back distant future. fact substantial percentage Americans incapable unwilling understand basic math nutritional label far concerning me. Great news! I've said times before, really can't wait never think hear Michael Osterholm again. still shrinking group people...

Either way hope get shot soon. That‚Äôs gotta make silent disease first make Ebola level deadly everyone it. nonsense right? get shot quarantine indefinitely, odds getting Covid 0%. seems silly think behavior doesn‚Äôt matter getting shot. wonder much Covid far likely kill elderly frail... lot countries, much population generally doesn‚Äôt *get* point old frail, plenty diseases already circulating die point (and also don‚Äôt medical infrastructure keep people alive long). wonder much Covid far likely kill elderly frail... lot countries, much population generally doesn‚Äôt *get* point old frail, plenty diseases already circulating die point (and also don‚Äôt medical infrastructure keep people alive long).

How EU Also talking getting covid vs getting effect covid upto death. (Current) Vaccines prevent infection right? Worldometers shows 45,116 cases 788 deaths yesterday hope people consider shutdowns anything absolute last-resort policy 

This happened shutdowns. real ones.

China real shutdowns. conquered covid.

Antimaskers treated prospective murderers. good idea long natural immunity lasts? year ones initial wave loosing protection.

Then mutations make variants 'of concern' likely reinfect. still figuring likely is.

I would really prefer efforts government businesses offering empolyees education &amp; incentives get vaccinated much higher degree proteciton hoping enough people already got sick &amp; developed long enough immunity another way. worse provide human petri dishes virus find yet another way around immunity also makes vaccines less effective.

i find concerning countries like UK track everyone vaccinated summer &amp; ahead USA vaccine trials kids vaccinated sooner still spending addtional millions future vaccines sequencing. UK gov made deal vaccine company make vaccines variants even spent getting everyone vaccinated.

also pharma companies figure things going continue &amp; calculating much increase prices:

**Pfizer eyes higher prices COVID-19 vaccine pandemic wanes: exec, Yasssssss ""You transmission even people fully vaccinated,"" said. ""The illness seems milder transmit much \[and we\]¬†won't see rapid explosive outbreaks.""

Um, duh? vaccines 100% effective, vaccine is. Basically seems like vaccines job well, illness severity reduced, transmission reduced deaths.

Why even news? uncle got covid. tube/hole/something stomach consume food, can't eat. They're sure he'll able walk spent 6 weeks hospital long road recovery.

But hey, least he's 99.7% survived! Experts maintain actual number total infections likely underreported much higher.

They call experts nothing !! really chill person grilledpeanuts.

I've legitimately seen people argue J&amp;J vaccine ""that means there's one-in-three chance I'll get COVID"". Using logic then, 100% chance getting COVID take vaccine? definitely accurate way view lot people / journalists stating it. 

But still fails take account background spread different study continue decrease people vaccinated. year daily new cases 100/day US vaccine would much higher chance 99.96% chance staying covid free.

Also coming absolute percent really make sense qualify given time frame like time period study. Clearly every day/week/month goes ""total"" percent chance catching covid goes up. seems herd immunity would benefit greatly. saying it‚Äôs fair outcome hugely beneficial portion population can‚Äôt get vaccines.

I guess news similar vein. Notice doesn‚Äôt mention time rejected doses would arrive. indeed never paranoid today. ""My name George, I'm unemployed &amp; live parents""

""I'm Victoria, **hi**"" ""The illness seems milder transmit much \[and we\]¬†won't see rapid explosive outbreaks.""

Wasn't expected? ""This serves remind us confident vaccine effective prevents severe illness death necessarily mean transmission stopped."" Yep, die ""sliver death"" around Idaho sub used opposite way long ago. suggestion restrictions lockdowns harm good met hostility almost religious chants 'We must follow Science‚Ñ¢, wear mask, stay indoors.' without acknowledging goalposts kept getting moved. 'Just weeks flatten curve..just vaccine..ok, vaccine, 85% people vaccinated..ok, well still stay away people even vaccinated'. people people say 'yeah, fuck that'. included.  vaccines working need ppl board get data actual patients Brazil sooner later. yet another game changer.

what first game changing variant? Beijing virus vaccine? also inactivated virus vaccine, different strain?  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Here‚Äôs hoping resume travel soon  nurse war zone going see injured combatant, guy would seen far carnage most. Let's straight this: USA Today headline wrong. Republicans don‚Äôt actually believe ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù go /r/Conservative salivate idea people wearing masks. 

You‚Äôll see tons stuff like this:

‚ÄúPeople need stop wearing masks cars!‚Äù 

They don‚Äôt want wear masks. want control personal freedom choice wear mask too. Bunch hypocrites. Every 1000 milliseconds Africa, year passes Cool! Great job Oklahoma! Get inoculated. get point lowest documented cases/deaths since onset pandemic. point think say definitively we‚Äôve beaten thing. Wow sound totally indoctrinated lmao Even vaccine long term effects, covid looking like massive long term effects. Agreed. People lying conditions en masse Texas get appointment and... really care? group 2 months. second dose, can't sign ""seconds"" ""thirds"" like taking fistfulls freebies candy bowl. get shot, one less covid vector society. also removed waiting list. Shots arms, fast possible, least waste possible. Let's go! FYI: anyone actually gives shit.

This data incomplete, covers 43 states -- notice gap numbers, states superspreader events missing data. data indicates 253 counted kid deaths, 444,878 total deaths. total deaths U.S. least 525,000 total -- shows gap AAP data (due underreporting/missing data states).

AAP data also undercounting Covid-19 deaths deaths undercounted 36 know survivors Covid-19 debilitating health susceptible COVID-19 nasty long-term effects: need sick Trumpist bullshit around Covid-19. whole country suffered it, continues suffer.

I've enough bullshit, myself. threats also incredibly scary legal immigrants. American citizens wrongfully detained correct ""papers"" identify got caught raids. Add ICE notorious blocking legal access, even ""deported"" Americans. 

ICE reform also going instantaneous there's actually limit Biden lot going take Congressional action reform it. YES going gradual change Summer living know, speaking abt pharmacies. states expanded pharmacy eligibility criteria...VA still behind regard, frustrating bc much easier schedule appointment waiting email got j &amp; j shot Saturday, moderate flu like symptoms first night. Since mild headache arm soreness. No. They‚Äôve said won‚Äôt require vaccines quarantine knows would change. 

The daily arrival limit going put place way ease complete shut travel. Yessir, get lot shit want live anywhere else.

When shit needs get done, get done I'm convinced, literally every day thread since inauguration, we've people complaining gloomy media is.

If there's change, started within past week two. shameful Yes!!! good point. Florida old people live alone mean, get wrong: I'm change I've year, fact seems like good time review I'm make sure good habits slipped.

But even got shot today it'd be, what, month half I'd fully vaccinated? Ugh.  data's poor moment, we'll see. Brazil still lower overall mortality rate US, may still finding pockets vulnerable people.  Got give someone. Better letting thrown out. Best analogy I‚Äôve heard yet. minute seconds hypoxia won‚Äôt kill even harm you, it‚Äôs pretty damn difficult save anyone else you‚Äôre already unconscious. MN opened multigenerational housing part next phase vaccines. early 20s brother still lives parents (late 50s/early 60s). They‚Äôre otherwise healthy. think could get vaccine? Here‚Äôs info Well yeah. still kinda sucks. Bad news doesn‚Äôt mean end near, see people already started downvoting. would fantastic progress, tbh. It‚Äôs going hell summer folks üòé might dumb question, reports new findings Pfizer only, Moderna well? Aren‚Äôt similar? Pfizer studied used globally? safe assume similar results Moderna vaccine whenever new headlines come Pfizer? director family NM definitely expressed frustration process. said really rough family/friends navigate system. Finland government closed restaurants, preparing (likely unenforceable) curfew. said two weeks ago release exit plan ""soon"", seemingly switched lockdown everything mode end sight.

Meanwhile cases plateauing, hospitals far overwhelmed vaccine situation rapidly improving. imagine morale. ""last March"" basis ""magic number""? No, situation done 180 thanks overwhelmingly positive developments consistently happening vaccine distribution. ""Experts say"" = handful scientists refuse acknowledge vaccines work Precedent? Many countries already require vaccines things like yellow fever. vaccine passport nothing new Spring around corner, Game Stonk keeps rising, I‚Äôm first time, COVID 1000 daily deaths. Feels good man Yeah already happening. Restrictions lifted slowly everyone seems relaxed hopeful around me. I'm betting two months restrictions lifted since general public able get vaccine starting April time at-risk groups already vaccinated. downvoting moving kind weird, stopping everything comment multiple times?  vaccine requirement people attending olympics?

That seems like ""two birds one stone"" solution eliminates risk competitors spectators spreading COVID, gets people vaccinated. also seems way less logistically complicated daily arrival limit even cancelling completely. Biden also prime minister Israel prime minister UK. ‚ÄúIdeologue‚Äù? 

 ‚ÄúMedia mogul‚Äù?

Your bias showing.

Fauci top authority disease. knows better it. look like coronavirus I'm saving people however many steps degrees separation able survive it.

That's way look it. Ive never flu life. However, Healthcare provider, work sick patients immunocompromised patients. getting shot, I'm reducing chance give patients potentially life threatening infection. I'm required job get annual flu shot well maintain vaccinations current reason. thats generalization, that's fact fine keep guard ty negative. lot misinformation bad faith actors play still. I'm like, ""Please include Caribbean too"" bullshit. Huh? seeing this? record, almost vaccines studied far less effective SA variant. mean effective. (Ex: J&amp;J 57% SA 76% US. That‚Äôs still good number) Link reports. article said, ""176 died Dec. 17.""

Where links? keep repeating bullshit, links prove it. March 9th, where's data links?

You any, spouting bullshit, cherry picking info links bother provide.

Why avoiding posting links? any, nonsense heard FoxNews whatever. What's going here, anyone wanting shot regardless group could potentially get access one extras? Good :) It‚Äôs accurate, 1 50 states issue Monday. Every state declining trend, far likely data accurate except blip.  many people visit Florida (the tourist capital America) get covid, take home called NY covid case counted Florida cases? rest world typically used seeing United States tackle solve problems effectively efficiently.

I'm sure reality supports assertion US. true strong history whatever fuck justify demanding everyone else get board justifications narrative, else.

From culture ally presents actions look effective efficient. all, freeist capitalist must effective efficient. ever talk frame every discussion exclusion framework. seems like common sense me. Literally nobody opposed that, seem like something even brought ""protect children"" debate, better worse mainly schools social distancing kids. much world lagging way behind US terms vaccine rollouts?  Florida reporting nailed feel. I‚Äôm. Done. staying home. tricky region stay norm math. approaching 3 million day get faster. 60 days, we‚Äôll added 180 Millions jabs 90 million we‚Äôve already done. someone doesn‚Äôt get within next 2 1/2 months it‚Äôs didn‚Äôt try all. first link says, ""More 2 million children diagnosed COVID-19, including 1 million since mid-November.

Right, every single report says fewer 200 children died. kids makes number remarkable.

Again, cars many, many times dangerous Covid kids. ever driven car Hence, could sooner fall. Enough bullshit.

This ""enough bullshit"" situation, neither us certain. Fauci said ""may"" vaccine September. pull quotes either article make either point. E.g., third Moderna said it‚Äôll begin age de-escalation study children ages 11 years 6 months year, Bancel said company doesn‚Äôt expect clinical data 2022.

The point people unsure. may early fall, woopie, count it. Moderna J&amp;J almost certainly going ready year, article, that's pretty small supply vaccines even best-case scenario. least agree that. Salt pepper ones top tier. That's usually case see usually good result us US. 

It's Sunday, holiday, there's non reporting. people kind agenda spreading misinformation jump spread Okay? Ya know already know teachers post reddit general teachers sub representation majority teachers felt whole time. groups SM platforms handful first hand comments saw, seems teachers happy remote long (as early past first couple weeks last spring 2 weeks kept getting expanded) panicked year affected students across board either mentally academically, least elementary level. 

But yeah handful kind reddit tends content wfh whole year keep criticizing attempt return normalish, understand district take 0 measures protections angry somehow okay qualified essential people working throughout whole pandemic somehow criteria complaining treated badly store employees, deserve funding (which part agree to) parents stop considering glorified sitters (the part disagree with, parents real concerns kiddos shamed also partly teachers past year made favorite moto)

Yeah try post teachers sub one kid suffered remote learning see either get downvoted hell bad parent thinking teachers lives disposable... like us ever said anything like that...  open everyone U.S., ship excess doses Canada Mexico. we've cleaned immediate neighborhood, start helping countries, well.

This canadian likes think! Maybe funny Still dropping, trend holding, Missouri dumped 50k cases logged previously. I‚Äôm pro vaccine (even got one myself) please explain would caught LONG TERM effects vaccine virus that‚Äôs year old. 

I know mers sars coronaviruses circulating environment that‚Äôs really I‚Äôm asking about.

Maybe there‚Äôs stuff look long term effects there‚Äôs something short term know stays short term based research, zero idea doubt vast majority people either. agree, still give credit due. excuse everything else handling, US crushed vaccine front give administration lot credit (and also Biden admin continuing crush going forward). worst, that's series logistic growth outbreaks, endless exponential growth

Okay, kind meaningless best, variants become less deadly thru repeated exposure partial immunity.

That best-case scenario; unfortunately largely opposite scenario seeing UK Brazil variants regard infectivity, deadliness, potential reinfection. Yeah wife pediatrician, mentioned hospital kids test positive flu RSV year. Usually two common diseases affect children winter. Pretty wild much masks distancing almost completely suppressed flu COVID somehow managed keep going strong spite that. almost sort begrudging respect hardy is. Many people seem think government corporations would never abuse intrusion privacy. Hell, lots people still believe, ""I nothing hide,"" justification expanded surveillance state. It‚Äôs part it, know Trump still office would negative spin it. Hate guy let‚Äôs call spade spade Sylvan talked anything. won‚Äôt you‚Äôre 70 obese fuck US's first confirmed case Jan 21st, whereas first confirmed case Italy late Feb.

Again, think we've determined money resources one factor eradicating virus. can't throw money expect go away, Asia crushed compared Europe US. hence health experts urging people still cautious around unvaccinated people, masking public buildings etc. Flu viruses evolve overtime know next time flu adapt become particularly vicious again, happened 1918, 1969, 2009. scientists limited number strains fit one flu shot rely statistics best judgement ones target greatest effect, yearly flu shot provides immune system yearly chance confer new immunity without actually infected. Gotta fair!!! Wait turn make sure everyone group chance decline vaccine! Glad see state DOH deciding hoard doses like dragon rather administer them. 1.3 million doses lying around counting. 1-2% daily growth rates. DAILY. adds huge! üëçüèº well need compare common factors people die daily..if 1000 less numbers, good news. Otherwise say always bad news every day people die common things 1000 day..Just trying avoid double standard. ""made fun of"" ""was horrified by."" Nobody sense making fun deaths anywhere.  shut take money? Yes that's correct. overweight bad people work fixing it. Hopefully see important things change news want us know that. Fear gets clicks clicks get ad revenue. Well, third time (if bothered read anything said) it‚Äôs bad. feel like need make something never said argue you‚Äôre loser, go it. hell good news?

There two possible outcomes here:

1. bad news he's right, we've year restriction, fear, uncertainty nothing; 
2. bad news he's wrong, he's advocating even worse suffering cavalier attitude lockdowns.

Whichever is, there's good news here. You‚Äôre going double posting graphs created anti-mask website, used 4 sources, none peer reviewed scientific journal?

I guess got voted for.  Keeping daughter confined longer much higher risk developing mental health issues becoming socially stunted. far biggest concern, covid isn‚Äôt big deal kids unless already sick/asthmatic/obese.

Let out. Let live.

Reasoning you‚Äôre interested: 


‚ÄòIn U.S., 100 children age 15 died COVID-19 2020. account 0.03% 376,000 COVID-19 deaths since virus hit country last spring less 0.5% 26,000 total child deaths causes.‚Äô

‚Äòmost child deaths first month life, linked premature gestation reasons connected circumstances right around birth‚Äô always go get shot Pfizer supply readily available it‚Äôs complete brainer. Keyword yet checked one aggregate numbers shows 16 states report Monday whatever normal reasons are.  numbers dropping thankfully I'm sure info accurate. Yeah, that‚Äôs accurate all. lot NE states got hit early knew less virus. states like FL, TX, SD decided deny learned effectively committed genocide grounds ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù. also know FL manipulated it‚Äôs data honestly clue deaths correctly classified there. Die heart attack....nah, it‚Äôs Covid FL, need test.  look excess death numbers get real picture there. Keep movin' goalposts. day there's legal document sign says ""I refuse treatment"" making decision yourself. then, selfish asshole. It‚Äôs strange though isn‚Äôt it? lot well educated friends really respect, refuse get vaccine. don‚Äôt trust quickly made. believe things would happened regardless President.

Every single country world struggled distribution initially ramping since then. also struggled getting people testing COVID Trump but, time, process greatly improved well. feel like you‚Äôre confusing AZ J&amp;J. J&amp;J‚Äôs trials roll pretty spotless. Yeah seems everyday news stories, constantly contradicting read :( 

# Wrong, silly. Biden already said, donate excess vaccines nations. don‚Äôt swimming vaccines, get shipped neighbors help also get donated covax initiative sent overseas. Big facts. Hyperbolic would work making things lot people still understand *the* Coronavirus, *a* Coronavirus. long continue allow wet markets thousands people close proximity, we're playing Russian Roulette.

It's miraculous able come vaccines quickly have, understand either. got extremely, extremely lucky CV19 still ""beaten"" sure.

All takes mutation respond known treatments vaccines we're back square one, time first responders hospital staff completely burned out. Well let's take scenario. Covid killed anyone hysteria. explain excess deaths recorded around world.
Edit - also takes quick Google find CDC deaths covid listed deaths flu pneumonia last statement also false. Conservatives pull double standard shit literally time. gives right still continue win elections? currently tests children hopefully end summer vaccine safe children.

I'll watching least much normally do. Meanwhile British Columbia....we opened registration yesterday 90. curve flat yet? hospitals run?   
Now lock downs extended ""in case"" something might flair up.    never see power corrupt quickly. massive holiday spike peaked nearly 10,000 cases around month ago back ~1,000 day joking around person md still going 65+. like idea ‚ÄúKaren‚Äôs‚Äù yelling store managers mask requirements, also yelling walking driveway without mask on. I'm former bartender, I've unemployed since last March. bar said would open allowed 50% indoor dining capacity NYC. mind working day make sure everyone good time. always celebrate shift haha News morning didn‚Äôt read carefully vaccines significantly less effective variants Yup. live Indianapolis, love city hate state. said, give props vaccine distribution. state built around transportation logistics benefits. signed aren‚Äôt positions available. hope help soon! People know already. issue isn‚Äôt let‚Äôs blame overweight people. It‚Äôs issue flawed regulations focus profits/low energy costs resulted lack investments power grid. That‚Äôs focus be. power outage lack water, also killed old people....are going blame old? cares. It‚Äôs good problem have. Also people realizing bad restaurant workers treated. Underpaid, overworked, put harms way people get grub owner get sweet $$$$. state come plans distribution. Biden‚Äôs team plan place increase availability work states distribution (ie NFL sites used vaccination, procuring vaccination doses, procuring vaccination supplies syringes...) CDC also counting ""influenza like illness"" deaths covid, whether covid suspected confirmed clinically. seem like good solid data side using? sports require tremendous amounts pre-planning athletes peak ( i.e Olympic ) condition games start. like playing game pickup basketball gym. amazed lead times sports require, life-altering conditions athletes put train participate Olympics.

At point, stick stake ground start work. I'm sure perfect solution Yes commit crime spree I‚Äôm dumping one trash getting burner use run. Sildenafil AKA Viagra originally medicine pulmonary edema, something patient likely due blood clots. Using DPA way basically functions de-facto export ban.

So yeah, EU could something similar, actual export ban. think DPA like measure.

But popular decision (except AZ, course). Saw article couple days ago. However also saw one saying Sinovac vaccine work, similar said work reuters, say 4 days apart.  forgot smile, squint mask on. Guess I‚Äôll squinting lot first. ""Of course is- here's opinion based nothing!"" upstate South Carolina felt like two things happened. 

A lot people finally got scared took seriously first time.   

The Social Media BS, went way down. events Nov. Jan 6th made lot people tune move something else. 

People nearly emboldened seen covid loving nuts now. known beginning government gonna drag ass providing real financial help American citizens. people lockdowns problem, since never going seriously sick killed virus.

And also California worse Florida lockdowns work? September 2021? Schools West Coast probably still closed September 2031. insistence teacher‚Äôs unions, course. Yeah, guess. could still see parents erring side caution people vaccinated though. significant number people society ability discern difference reputable source information complete malarkey. result terrible education system. people understand there's strain resists vaccines have, we'll update vaccine give people already vaccinated booster new strain? Think Winston Churchill said: always count America right thing exhausting options. CNN Executives: ""Oh god. done? 45 retiree Florida talked vaccine much people banging doors get it! one going watch TV anymore. going do? Let's tell home much fun never leave again!"" hell understand find state's thresholds? mean sure, state led Republicans, since pro-fact. projection? projecting exactly? 

Not berated one friends wearing mask, going see movie, going outside. Moderna? It‚Äôs possibly could around 150 million April 1! Unreal. least ballpark. ridiculous. life ""a stoic march towards graves."" endless covid inevitable (it isn't, even were, 99% people recover), go live. Pfizer also big shitty company CEO seem nearly cuntish CEO AZ, least there's hope. really isn‚Äôt full story. Variant cases blowing based data NYTimes ran recently. percentage total cases going well. left unchecked trend clear. Cases start rising again. race shots arms increasing variant cases. I‚Äôll take whichever get wait middle april next explosion cases.

I think understand vaccines herd immunity work. Wouldn‚Äôt athletes stronger hearts expected recover better? ran pain sometimes. don‚Äôt think know either way unless got MRI. I‚Äôm encouraged longer feel chest pain. He's obviously US.

No one sent non-trivial amount time traveling internationally could honestly describe US shithole. Oh god thank much! Seriously taking time answer cite sources. Super informative. appreciate you. able share information family well! 

Hope great day! scientific evidence need fear fourth wave somehow overpower current tidal wave vaccines people getting?

That's evidence works. Morons scientific background can't scream ""I UNDERSTAND TRUE LA LA LA"".

It's *speculative*, evidence-based decision making. Reals feels. know are, sad part lot media keeps talking variants bad usually article buried say vaccines work ignore amend article later. bad articles like stop make people question getting vaccine variants escape get one? anyone eagerly wants one, trickle though hopefully. also enough keep cases low foreseeable future along natural immunity remain unvaccinated. Wow 6-7 weeks?! Let‚Äôs go! Yup, we're plateau now,

What data looking reach conclusion? Well it‚Äôs interesting counter argument thinking it, probably subset eats ever before. Whether it‚Äôs anti restriction craving social interaction, probably people done reverse ‚Äúeat less‚Äù habit. guess question whether outnumber people might spend less money 2022.

Anecdotally, buddy play dota regularly lives Denver never goes though like used go lot. wonder somebody near goes eat ever got habit Pursuing social interaction. Anyone else find concerning rate COVID mutation past year? Hive mind work. soon first person downvotes it, next person see likely downvote too. it‚Äôs nice score hidden first hours comment. Yup! There's upper limit deaths. Countries restrictions and/or impose restrictions practical/economic reasons markedly higher death rates us. I‚Äôve multiple doctors tell yes Covid real, infected cloth masks. It‚Äôs basically Covid sponge wearing day infecting you. better wearing either mask all, surgical mask. infected viral load. Unless someone sneezes directly mouth, getting Covid. source provides scientific evidence. discrediting science?  like France much better. numbers I've looked (cdc tableof deaths age), assume people age 40, 50, 60, 70 equally likely catch covid, risk death multiplies 2.5-3x jump age. going cutoff point decreasing age worth prioritizing age want stop transmission vaccines everyone think I'll go walk. it. got mine too. Developed drug-substance production Leiden, Netherlands Janssen Vaccines. Janssen Vaccines part Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., Belgian company. subsidiary American Johnson &amp; Johnson company.

The plant Netherlands fill finish. drug substance produced Leiden exported Italy, Spain, USA, South-Africa India fill finish. know think needs whole public health campaign obesity like quitting smoking. Would really love know us sick days barely symptoms. 

Better dying either way woulda loved mild arm soreness side fence instead. pretending anything. Re-read OP said. til next pandemic! known Covid 19 virus attaches fine particulate pollution surprising virus could attach pollen. surmised industrial north Italy lot diesel particulate air, like Bergamo, infection rate high. sick late Feb 2020, basically weak, stomach issues, super dizzy week. probably sickest I've ever been, unable move think. Finally felt better week, kind lost taste day, otherwise felt fine. 

That night, felt like going pass noticed full-body rash. flat, red, non-itchy moving rapidly. Went ER, given prednisone benadryl shot. epi-pen since throat vitals fine.

Took three days go away, developed rosacea sensitive skin it. Never happened before, saw many Italy similar symptoms well. Weird stuff ambulance chaser attorneys gonna busy next years. mate isnt . many reasons. Imo simple age bracket best way ensure there's never demand bottleneck.

People complain grocery store workers can't get vaccinated, prioritized differently, people would complain vaccines getting distributed. Yeah agree could certainly longer. I‚Äôve doubt among last. next delivery numbers interesting. Idiots  Congrats! do? lost 40 lbs beginning months pandemic thanks anxiety + intermittent fasting. It‚Äôs hard since good mood come back. haven‚Äôt lost anything probably 6 months. Article isn‚Äôt free. think wrong. hope wrong. ‚Äî Covid vaccination efforts continue roll across country, new poll suggests looming snag: almost quarter Americans say don‚Äôt actually want shots. bipartisan majority Americans say least somewhat satisfied vaccines rolled around country approve governors handled pandemic. 35% respondents think fellow Americans done best manage virus outbreak, 53% maintain public‚Äôs response left disappointed. friend mine super mild case covid still can't exercise without coughing, 6 months on. covid good shape struggle this. Since fake virus anyway, every single one immediately family members also friends automatically lose COVID-19 related healthcare coverage next two years. 

It's fake news anyway right? can't sick can't spreading anyone else. Pfizer needs make poutine worries all! Seems like quite people know Plague Inc made board game.

Eating bad addiction you‚Äôve never overweight you‚Äôll never know fucking hard break bad habits developed child. like EUs schedule schedule seems involve vaccines AZ produces facilities inside EU. facilities seem produce significantly less AZ expected. shortfalls effect EU everybody else? cdc director telling us reversing decrease last week wonder countries choose same. 

A friend mine want covid vaccine article read facebook, intends moving UK August. asked advisor school she'd need quarantine vaxxed, said no, student move start school immediately person. fuck knows that's even accurate, feels yikes. 

Also curious see Canada/US border chooses lieu quarantine. NZ big tourism spot winter . lots good skiing mountain activities. Abnormal ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù stuff harmful kids.

I agree I've got bad news climate change. 

Actually, know what, no. good news. good news humans adaptable, adapt. Life change, adapt. question really hard study unlikely get good answer subreddit. Efficacy trials good determining type thing - depend vaccinated control group similar levels exposure. would probably need nuanced understanding exposure prior immunity relates subsequent infection, like... PhD level insight immunology, even possible know. Yeah makes sense. primary care physician, try find one might know. I'm younger wont able get one little anyways, hoping different options available turn comes around. Even though may life threatening would really rather avoid reaction like may prone Moderna. rash develop sick? Constitution takes freedom assemble assemble hold meetings peacefully talk things. executive orders limit crowds violated freedoms given us US citizens, would ruled unconstitutional 100m week!! Seasonal allergies caused people get tested. people popped positive since lot people covid think due asymptomatic cases etc Plus use bottle piss  White House definitely clipped wings ""it safe open schools"" statement.  Every statement made since feels like White House vetted it. Ain't nothing swab cotton. get attitude - reporting primarily data generated. *Taps head*

Can't wrong reopening guidelines never announce reopening guidelines.  ever say it‚Äôs unique Chinese people? I‚Äôm talking Chinese people right we‚Äôre talking COVID. Want talk Ebola? talk whole different continent you‚Äôd like, it‚Äôs argument. Zika virus? Swine flu? Also argument. Throw syringes t-shirt cannons shoot people‚Äôs windows. Children health problems. **more people vaccinated CONFIRMED cases**

The CDC says there's 7.2 undetected cases every detected case. So. title hundred million regard. Texans: *chuckles* I'm danger Impossible tell, imo.

EU got 10 million already reduced target 40 million originally 80 million. production shortfalls effect deliveries EU? talking EU getting vaccines everybody else talking EU getting proportional part order vaccines produced inside EU, like everybody else. Exactly, Israel access vaccines may extent greater proportion population US think argued currently it‚Äôs important 100% compliance nurses hospital support staff opposed congregate care employees.  Virtually residents option vaccinated. 

Yet arrive hospital usually weakest.  Even aren‚Äôt there‚Äôs reason emerge Covid avoided.  

My friends (who really careful) spent first week childbirth home Covid sadly gave parents careful isolating two weeks prior help c-section . Everyone turned ok horrible situation. 100% got hospital. Folks saying summer last 10, planet on? fetishism anything else. Yeah know. got first dose week ago also peaked march already way point. also vaccine. idea another wave countries vaccinating solid rates seems less less likely day. think that's question doctor anyone here, way many variables.

I personally similar rash last year, possibly covid negative antibody test way know, want J&amp;J supposedly weaker side effects. However, I'll take anything get point.

But definitely check doctor, I'd probably wait 30 minutes site opposed usual 15 careful. even vaccine 4 months ago, fuck talking about? new Zealand high score shootings christchurch massacre? happened too. I'm getting second shot tomorrow, hope get sick. moderna? heard somewhere unvaccinated people live largely vaccinated population safer vaccinated person largely unvaccinated population. think implies even someone vaccinated, repeatedly expose large amounts covid likely get it. Well happy birthday! may odd year next year you‚Äôre 16 much fun one Dad, late 60s got shots. 

I'm seeing next weekend first time year Ministry Health website (in information updated three time day.

I see very, strong correlation lack scientific literacy complaining media gentle enough someone's personal fears. difference assertion mask mandate nothing whether vaccine effective. fact, opposite, get vaccinated could still carry virus.

and least get answers whether people vaccinated pass somebody else

Its one way other. time. data indicates he's wrong. definition broad that. Freedom association laid constitution even narrow definition freedoms limited.

CDC gets information states. people would behave recklessly anyways. real problem would people recently infected testing negative disregard safety protocols think clear. end probably still lives saved enabling self-tests, per title. commission knew would given incentives type collaborations much sooner. commission task Israel traditional conservative decisions. also significant anti mask movement talking point.

I think Israeli decision mostly inertia 'why not' long public really care yet.

Mind cases still relatively high Israel (though 50% cases kids teens). We've waited year, weeks really matter, 2 months doubt masks still mandated actual confirmed deaths due covid know goes. Anyone know cases shot today? backlog? Every drug store country at-home rapid tests sale OTC, like yesterday. Certainly demand would hasn‚Äôt happened? Shameful isn‚Äôt case yet. Japan vending machines stuff. end year EU 2 years late Yeah tons us hospital including me, chills, fever, muscle aches, energy 24 hours second dose. Shit joke. Sure CA‚Äôs recovery daily case numbers surge much better places fewer restrictions FL, Texas, Sweden.

Of course many factors work anyone trying use death rate graph article argue mitigation measures don‚Äôt work aren‚Äôt worth cost honest. I'll take ""Stating Obvious,"" $500, Alex. two conflicting opinions subreddit: 

1. need expand eligibility.
2. impossible get reservation older people technologically literate.

I think places difficulty filling reservations, although I'm sure are. likely issue scaling many administer day. actually denying reality last decades international travel? said causal relationship? graphs didn't. didn't. drew conclusion. stops hospitalized dying, want it. getting symptoms nice added bonus. Turkey vaccinating Sinovac without people dying. take comment grain salt. factory France Sanofi start producing J&amp;J next months. 12M doses every month. guess Sanofi get vaccines.

Maybe late UE market, least vaccine factory nothing. Almost like possible sad one thing. acknowledge people dying also miss nightlife/socializing/travel time. one said problem people want 3+ kids economy let them.

&amp;#x200B;

Nope, economy nothing it.

&amp;#x200B;

During great depression, 1935, Spanish women 3.5 kids each.

During economic BOOM years (1997-2007), 2000, Spanish women 1.19 kids each.

SOURCE: COVID either. COVID-19 around year 2000, Spanish women still kids. Source someone explain rationale behind allowing many southern borders spite CDC still advising restrictions travel gatherings? find loss comes conversation.  places basing eligibility people‚Äôs professions question like asking microsoft forced make apple phones vice versa. That's works. Also, product inferior. Yeah could phrased differently... guess mean is, would extra precaution unwarranted think people forgotten already HARD logistics moderna pfizer are. start ship outside US 2nd 3rd world countries J&amp;J going come clutch. background logistics? not, please feel free post things understand.  One dose Pfizer effective J&amp;J though

uh huh. [citation needed]

edited reason viable shortage.

You absolutely idea talking shows. No, kids go checked within last 3 days iirc. Florida seems everyone else. 

You mean they're poorly poorly-run states. I'm saying let rip population

Except saying would mean playbook identified ways target ""pinch points"" speak, otherwise let life go on.

Whose closing schools good example

A good example wrong, transmission schools associated community transmission.""

The part equation, always, is:
""Evidence date suggests schools implement mitigation strategies fidelity, transmission within schools limited.""

But know teachers, many schools *not* that. Since anti-makers reality-averse decided make political thing, many schools south especially bother precautions.

When country gigantic shitshow believe mass testing last year, pretty hard point cause...but follow experts, predicted huge surges worse think limiting large gatherings, mask requirements necessary (like shopping/eating venues) short, targeted lockdowns would done same, maybe better, controlling spread, would minimized collateral damage society economy.

This essentially Sweden backfired miserably.

It's absolutely fine criticize improve system, particularly new information comes light. CDC announced people completely vaccinated meet private, unmasked, minimal value.

Again, virus dictates response, badly people want go Spring Break. with* trouble records universally recordkeeping mess.

They're billing applicable insurance possible, insurance/medicare coverage, they're still vaccinating, billing records necessarily going tell whole story high degree trust. Touch√© Old people 80% one week first dose Feb 1 Israel, vaccination open anyone month week now.

Everyone know either got vaccine want one, whatever age.

This nothing old people partying, young people go There's fifty sources, every state health department I've looked says fine print explain count people. Here's Florida : click county data notice county two numbers one residents one non residents, 

But meant snow bird numbers.... quick Google search show Florida earned reputation snowbird capital. ....... like, work living? life? maybe life transportation &amp; popping doc's office easy?

Proud IL. filled card wife handed card vaccine type (moderna) Lot number it. mean shit could put name front wanted to. already said, Missouri data dump. Good rule thumb, data looks anomalous, that's probably is. I'd take PTO shoes, worth, think I'm *also* overly cautious. want take chances home stretch, y'know? would appears wrong, always understood it, like got first dose today, added first dose numbers, 21-28 days later, get 2nd dose, removing first dose numbers, get added 2nd dose numbers still part first numbers. hence reason say ""42% 55% gotten 2nd dose"" 

hopefully someone actually understands explain us. need getting shots arms. Virginia point still prioritizing people 70 years old. 100% think would beneficial get many shots possible fast possible clean stragglers back end. think going fix facebook friends stupidity? think going one day need resell it? 

Not great analogy, imo. Run numbers, bet $5 likely catch covid undesired outcome waiting period avoid undesired outcomes waiting ""better"" vaccine majority family New Jersey, Italy, two greatly impacted areas world. one anything regular hand washing, reusing masks months time go somewhere, almost nothing happened. One family member COPD caught COVID hospital died, literally deathbed already. world blew load calling new bubonic plague. OP specifically said think option taken away, opinion ridiculous. agree forced anybody, advocating completely removing option anything inflammatory. Worth noting 1.35m lateral flow tests, mostly done people displaying symptoms. rest actual PCR tests used diagnose cases.

Really including figure, seem set now. thank link .. answered lot questions long term effects. Guess what, days distribution issues like that. Look moving average instead glossing stats every single day. Average 2+ million average 3+ million next month. claimed vaccine harmful without proof, shit youre promoting non sense might put people getting vaccines. 

Like said, dont want info government news source, want peer reviewed journal. 

Yup, believe China destined become top country within decade covid supporting theory. Also good job looking peoples past posts, personally dont mind whatever say stand by. know people find annoying bratty. know extended covid variants well? I‚Äôm medical documentation, isn‚Äôt passport proves you‚Äôve booster shots well, worries me. Shouts FEMA stepping getting mom vaccination Miami yesterday! like strategy lot waking 7 a.m. three times week watching Publix appointments disappear like smoke air! Imagine meeting grandchild conspiracy theories. Good god. Yeah I'm same, bit phobia rough time always blood extraction, feel vaccine all.

Later day relatively mild effects, phobia that, needles (""luckily"" can't phobias everything) go problem second dose.

To honest take vaccine since school, remember feel. Got mine today! incredibly sore, ready get with! Sorry hear that, good falling line thinking what's best people around you. I‚Äôm getting j&amp;j less hour. I‚Äôm 27 I‚Äôm nervous can‚Äôt even tell lol I'd imagine depends many coronaviruses and/or similar spike proteins body exposed to. Younger people active immune systems tend stronger responses immunizations. Call local pharmacies see waitlist get extra doses would thrown one uses totally honest, personally never concerned dying COVID since rates age health incredibly low. I'm worried spreading others sick symptoms. fact data points mRNA vaccines significantly better care anything hospitalization

[citation needed] top this, mRNA vaccine manufacturing highly specialized never done scale before. simply matter getting manufacturers make more.

Output limited bottlenecks worldwide supply raw materials, existence bespoke machinery exists nowhere world except mRNA vaccine labs/factories.

[More mRNA Vaccine Manufacturing | Pipeline Vaccine Manufacturing | Pipeline lucky different, effective vaccines means much vaccines total, much sooner. super rich important people government already gotten theirs. would care now? **US COVID Deaths May Undercounted 36 Percent** implication underlying data could also undercounted similar amount.

And parroting conservative talking points about, ""Covid dangerious, here's why,"" bullshit. coworker tested positive week feels fine. company letting come back tomorrow requiring negative test say he'll false positive since still antibodies.  

I'm debating taking PTO week two avoid around (relatively close contact environment). Possibly relevant, got first round Moderna vaccine little week ago. 

Is cause concern overly cautious? also read Johnson Johnson evaluated believe UK therefore likely exposed one variants could impacted efficacy data somewhat. in, Pfizer / Modernal ones also exposed agressive strain maybe &lt;90% things trial equal, likewise J&amp;J may bit higher normal strain. 

All said, people want coverage themselves. point vaccines suprisingly effective less effective variants. Yet they‚Äôll chain smoke, eat McDonald‚Äôs drink soda every day.

Go get Mom spot. need open eyes listen redditors. It‚Äôs enough dropping masks people stampede them. Don‚Äôt put bets favourite restaurant force anyone mask walking door table.  part comment value judgement? OP talked option. agree virtual school forced kids terrible. Yeah people chain smoke eat fast food daily. logic doesn‚Äôt make sense Yes, there's plenty deluded fat people. Look healthy size. work healthcare design always think worst case scenario. Every time start new project, think compliance future audits remediate problems. Prepare worst hope best üòÇ 

Things getting control. Vaccine rollout accelerating, examples New Zealand Israel. going back normal. shaking hands anymore though. don‚Äôt think specific day it‚Äôs over. However, two big landmarks along way: Memorial Day 4th July think mark ‚ÄúVictory Europe‚Äù ‚ÄúVictory Japan‚Äù day, respectively might try did: put name phone number general practitioner area, asks want information sent medical provider, check box. that‚Äôs option. can't speak everywhere country, personally travel never really felt impeded me. I've never seen checkpoint anywhere state. went Arizona Boston May 2020 one airport checked temperature anything, think even *asked* felt sick. situation went Boston Washington DC September 2020, got tested random pop testing site town asked wanted test- never even sent results.

I think domestic travel greatly impacted pandemic past first couple weeks. totally possible states taking extremely seriously know about, legitimately made difference ability travel across country last year. I'm sure say traveling internationally. people cal medical fat phobia mostly fat people told doctors need lose weight order healthy France, Italy, Brazil, Canada, Poland, Ukraine, Iran, Ukraine, Hungary, Jordan, Chile many countries trending up, back 45K cases today US. article cite even mentions always technically correct. I'll take fearmongering science day week. sure Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine cause cancer?

Ask doctor get phd. probably easier ask doctor. tried several times suggest people relying science know they're communicating terms. They've done that, pasted refuse acknowledge pretend one person's guess rather entire team experts clearly trying avoid yet another disasterous wave.

If want sooner, get anti-vaxxers get vaccinated, anti-maskers face reality people responsible weeks beat together instead pretending arbitrary.

The impact another potential mutation many worried everyone else well. Unlike lot countries, we're fortunate enough (currently) finally competent leadership.

I need source every reply thread (and one is). google answer include source. J&amp;J still new vaccine too. There's sense saying one safer long term moment. HMU 12 months. mean theory 4000 people left world given resources could easily find way pump numbers even takes thousands years. message someone vaccinated EXTREMELY low odds catching/transmitting covid unvaccinated person? unvaccinated person healthy big deal?

Kind combination two. There's low odds vaccinated person would transmit COVID unvaccinated person, unvaccinated person 90-year-old grandma low odds event could kill her, lot people comfortable level risk there's still significant community spread COVID. hand, unvaccinated person 10-year-old son, even low odds event probably worst give sniffles low grade fever days. shouldn‚Äôt mentioned partying part wild child phase. meant general time life freedom grow try new things little repercussion. High school college formative years kids young adults get explore discover are. think back cool clubs activities participated college - simply CAN‚ÄôT get experience sitting front computer. 

As kids sidelines - learn something formative years too, even aren‚Äôt partying socialites. Hell, one kids high school! But, blossomed college grew ton also lot fun learning independent. Sometimes kid sidelines it‚Äôs perks - find like minded people find niche. Again, that‚Äôs much difficult you‚Äôre learning computer. 

So, would argue incredibly heart wrenching. Because, it‚Äôs one year missing - much longer many young people pick pieces bounce back. 

During time, many young people fallen deep depression, wrestled anxiety, become suicidal, developed OCD tendencies, etc. doesn‚Äôt go away soon covid ‚Äúover‚Äù. Sure, many bounce back fine. But, also significant population suffers PTSD long lasting mental effects work trauma. 

So, it‚Äôs nice want offer hope get better later life. But, example isn‚Äôt true experience - **you didn‚Äôt deal massive, life-altering, traumatic pandemic long term isolation one formative years.** frame reference flat different theirs.

**Their trauma valid.** Instead giving example life better later life giving kind advice really, think give voice chance share pain mourning losing one formative years. Because, give advice haven‚Äôt lived shoes? Like said above, didn‚Äôt lose formative year pandemic. could possibly give advice bounce back that? God, hate AZ really strong, wonder public opinion would like AZ marketing motivations Pfizer trying spin positive news positive... yeah mb test PTSD? Every single person masked local vaccine sites even though compliance great public here. .9!? Quick! Shut everything again! opinion shops closed opening schools offices problem.

They can't figure outbreaks happening anymore suspect private gatherings schools biggest drivers.

The british variant said infectious children plus expecting kids wear masks properly keep distance ridiculous.

Keeping shops closed fuels Amazon getting richer kills local businesses impact spread may small. Listen! anything causes 25 deaths day banned.

Catching naturally takes days become symptomatic virus replicate inside reach levels set immune system's full response. injection there's set amount foreign bodies injected suddenly sets immune system pretty fast. Since fixed amount body cleans gone go right back normal. real infection tough fight get rid keeps replicating slowly return normal 

Once started feeling little better back 100% two hours later. unique special daily experiences 30s 1000 times special experiences teens twenties.

Are vaccinating faster Biden president? Almost certainly, would wager it‚Äôs marginal. article nearly two weeks old. Since Germany started use AZ vaccines people older 65 started vaccinating new groups people (e.g. teachers kindergartners). Let's feel proud this.

From article -

 ""Two staff members 10 residents tested positive Cottonwoods long-term care facility Kelowna 221 publicly-funded beds.

Nah. reason whatsoever. North Carolina opening next round vaccination anyone ""has smoked 100 cigarettes lifetime"".
With way confirm that, basically making vaccine available anyone adult matter months time. variants see ever catch break pandemic. Brazil variant alone 60% chance evading person's immune system, even they've infected another variant. (Sources: believes pandemic associated restrictions ever actually end simply kidding themselves? swear edit title, actual headline.

Certain tourist-dependent EU countries like Greece pushing vaccine passport system know many Brits vaccinated time summer want going there. EU soon implementing this. 
 
That might well good Greece, UK really get much it. money goes abroad creates huge tensions generations, young people endured lockdown protect old ones miss another summer pensioners jet holiday.  
 
The UK want young people rioting, new measure essentially ""lol no"" plans EU vaccine passport. Urgent care centers friend He‚Äôs got US. describes entirely accurately rofl... nice ""code"". totally agree. I‚Äôve tried wagging finger didn‚Äôt work I‚Äôm trying mass telepathy. Even outbreak airborne ebola R0 20 would still go outside proper PPE. That's awesome, congrats! :) We‚Äôre sequencing nearly much majority countries reported variants. It‚Äôs likely bunch brewing. experience way. definitely get it.  Yup, state (MN) opening second group today. hit 70% 65+ vaccinated triggers next segment. It'll snowball here. I'm bottom list I'm thinking April possibility. Get waiting list extra vaccines! laws North Carolina 65. called Walgreens we‚Äôre put wait list. able get vaccine two days later.

Anyone else feel like end USA going sort come without big fanfare?

More vaccinations made. people taking them. Overall people confident vaccines. got tested approved. feels like month we'll busy normal lives pandemmic back burner without kind huge event declaring end war victory anything like that. kind petter out. children currently get vaccinated. guarantee probably lot doses going waste right bc age restrictions. open everyone already.

We‚Äôre letting 7.2B sacrifice year live allow aunt Edna 6 months... Thank you. This. 

The mRNA double shots designed overkill, get right first time. much give natural infections usually provide.

Yeah worldometer us 41k Note: given first dose, 30m actually fully vaccinated (again without evidence J J vaccination). 

It‚Äôs good hear vaccination rates increasing every day. it‚Äôs still concerning. missing 20M AZ?

This intelligent headline. Excuse sir, death cult wants go back normal. get way death cult. Good estimates potential range total US infections , although stopped updating March 8th. TLDR likely ranged 60M 163M infected, 90M quotable value March 8. ol' snotty slope argument. interesting. guy come store couple months ago. chatting topic timeline could indoor wine-tastings store. 

I said: ""I hope fall"". 

He said wife works major hospital system Baltimore, unofficial chatter end April able largely side this. Apparently models shots administered + recovered infection immunity pointing towards April major decline infection metrics. 

I thought wife colleagues wildly optimistic this. 

Now I'm hearing echoing exact thing here. 

It's hearsay, sauce share, gives optimism.  Thanks Joe Biden, savior!!!

7.2 says EU pay upfront costs says nothing UK based operations.

Schedule A, page 39 redacted (or, strictly, text redacted provides evidence support statement, seems clear text redacted would provide evidence supporting claim).

So, got evidence. Again. exactly mean ""mandatory"" sense? ask I've seen topic ""mandatory"" vaccinations come everyone talking thing. people think ""mandatory"" sense vaccinated travel school. I've also seen people advocating radical stuff imposing criminal charges refusing vaccinate, arresting people forcibly vaccinating them. 

You think needing ""to get money, leave house, anything dodging issue"", *exactly* advocating here? Forcibly vaccinating people will? Criminal charges people comply? Something else? 

I'd interested seeing exactly *how* think vaccines mandatory.  Also- people take JnJ they‚Äôre convinced mRNA mess balls... read Reddit! getting pat back vaccinating entire population first, even though half city like London. sure heartbreaking nothing virus everything control Yes, BioNTech upper hand, allowing Marburg bought, converted brought online mRNA production mid-February. Oh no. Young people catching virus barely suffer from. There's great debate allow private sector begin vaccinating. greatly accelerate vaccinations 1.15 (c)

7.2

Schedule page 39 sad Honestly, 50+ final age bracket anyone uses. MASSIVE drop covid deaths 50 (like, someone 40s twice risk someone 30s, someone 50s nearly 15x risk). really hope 50+ done, focus shifts toward reducing transmission general, anyone get fast possible. sad again, EU even take vaccines stole us. millions doses people refuse take insist stealing ours.

The UK ban exports, company free establish vaccine manufacturing capacity UK export 100% vaccines want. bought capacity manufacturing facilities paid billions establish scratch get first 100m doses. EU could done this, chose to, insisted they'd open business even criticised UK engaging ""vaccine nationalism."" international companies felt confident placing orders EU supply chain. became clear totally screwed vaccine procurement, fucked us engaging worst vaccine nationalism seizing vaccines bound countries use instead.

Well actually first tried extort vaccines UK, almost provoked return Troubles invoking article 16, illegally threatened block export Pfizer vaccines UK dispute company happens half-British (threatening lives untold numbers Brits), raided AZ plant ""prove"" exporting EU-produced vaccines UK forced sweep whole thing rug turned nothing, finally gave trying extort UK, stole vaccines etc. begging US give vaccines, hypocrites. yet still come droves defend them. get it. sad?

I know people said passing never watch news, think it‚Äôs dumb get vaccine, it‚Äôs whatever. source 'EU good, UK bad' narrative EU official. AZ breached contract, EU sue them. try scapegoat UK truth EU screwed procurement desperately trying blame others. Sex required. says Immaculate Conception movie Junior. Way completely miss point. point deadly mutation entirely realm possibility coronaviruses Lol that‚Äôs funny mentions pfizer Moderna also article know delivered contracts end February vast majority would AZ (especially since Moderna supposed deliver 10 million total Q1 drop would little impact) question much reduce transmission. bigger question is: open tell people stop wearing masks - increase transmissibility offset vaccine's reduction transmissibility? 
 
 
I get impression Israel first let world know. Preliminary findings suggest vaccinated population reduces transmission 25% normal. impression, given chronic undertesting asymptomatic spread, Rt naturally ~4. closed economy, dwindles long-term average ~1. open back return 4 - 25%, we're still sitting 1. 
Meaning virus becomes endemic. evolves anyway. 
 
This whole plan stupid. We're addressing deaths, serious damage wreak lungs, heart, brain, *testes*, everything else. studies suggest even 50% asymptomatic people still show long-scarring CT scans. 
Worse though, virus still slipping around undetected among vaccinated population provides *immense* evolutionary pressure develop variant truly vaccine resistant. 
 
From start, anyone cared dying. presumably solution *that* vaccines, one cares spreads radar. 
 
That's literally CDC saying telling us vaccinated people hang out, even know vaccine transmission thing. care transmits - care people die. that's makes leadership look bad. overflowing hospitals. title inaccurate. title article suggests correlative relationship causative one written mean close 40% one point, numbers aren‚Äôt bad all. Likewise many false positive never got sick. great news. Particularly consider Moderna developed updated booster addresses S.African variant directly. partner handle manufacturering load help get available quicker becomes necessary. Seeing university needs see (in person) Visa confirm validity entry date, I'm sure they'd best pleased whilst supposed quarantined. fact I'd willing bet they'd report you. need quarantine. I've saying since early physical mental risk levels thing exact opposites. greatest physical risk older population, they're ones mostly dying disease. 

But arguably, said done, mental damage might actually severe cost whole thing (since ""only"" 500k Americans died, 300 million felt unquantifiable sting ""new normal""). me, there's doubt mental aspect far worst kids, decreasing pretty steeply age. Kids teenagers missing entire year school insanely bad. That's awful minds, development, socialization, everything. years absolutely vital limited get second shot that. similar disaster college-age kids too. Think many people treasure college experience life, mention important regard setting rest life career wise maybe even finding partner. 4 years long, millions kids lost QUARTER counting.

I would argue extends forward anyone lives figured out. Anyone single. Anyone job want. Anyone great living situation. Anyone trying branch out. Anyone trying grow. Think 46 year old dad packed work PC March 2020 took home 2700 sqft house suburbs, he's running company's network ever since full time/pay getting spend time family, using extra commute time finally get around projects he's sitting garage 5 years. guy life figured past 10 years. What's mental impact him? Really lot. take 70 year old parents. Married 50 years. Retired. Medicare, social security. Everything want need world inside 4 walls already. barely leave house normal year. Pretty much nothing changed lives. get curbside pickup instead going store. That's it. 

Compare middle school kid lost entire 6th grade year seen friends since last March. Junior gearing try play college ball recruiting barely even exists now. young adult graduated 2020 tried start new job without ever getting chance meet coworkers. lonely single person trying meet someone 2020. even comparable. level loss scale people catastrophic, shouldered generations young people already asked bear much burden (multiple once-in-a-lifetime economic disasters, hilariously low wages/wealth accumulation compared past, unobtainable housing, climate change doomsday, financially impossible start family, etc.) think huge problem going feeling reverberations many many years come. secure supply good contract negotiation

Such good contract negotiation UK uses EU funds vaccine production. indeed hell contract use EU funds vaccine benefit.

That led Carlos del Rio, MD, distinguished professor medicine Emory University Atlanta, Georgia, suggest future drug like molnupiravir could taken first days symptoms prevent severe disease, similar Tamiflu for¬†influenza.

""I think critically important,"" told¬†Medscape Medical News¬†of data. Emory University involved trial molnupiravir del Rio part team. ""This drug offers first antiviral oral drug could used outpatient setting.""

Wendy Painter, MD, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, presented data virtual Conference Retroviruses Opportunistic Infections, agreed. data promising, ""We need see people get better actual illness"" assess real value drug clinical care.

""That's phase 3 objective we'll need prove,"" told Medscape Medical News.

Phase 2/3¬†efficacy safety studies drug underway hospitalized nonhospitalized patients.

In brief pre-recorded presentation data, Painter laid researchers know far: preclinical studies suggest molnupiravir is¬†effective number viruses, including coronaviruses and¬†specifically¬†SARS-CoV-2. prevents virus replicating inducing¬†viral error catastrophe¬†‚Äî essentially overloading virus replication mutation virus burns can't produce replicable copies.

In this¬†phase 2a, randomized, double-blind control trial, researchers recruited 202 adults treated outpatient clinic fever symptoms respiratory virus confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection day 4. Participants randomly assigned¬†to three different groups: 200 mg molnupiravir, 400 mg; 800 mg. 200 mg arm matched one-to-one placebo-controlled group, two groups three participants active group every one control.

Participants took pills twice daily 5 days, followed total 28 days monitor complications adverse events. days 3, 5, 7, 14, 28, researchers also took nasopharyngeal swabs PCR tests, sequence virus, grow cultures SARS-CoV-2 see virus that's present actually capable infecting others.

Notably, pills refrigerated point process, alleviating cold-chain challenges plagued vaccines.

""There's urgent need easily produced, transported, stored, administered antiviral drug SARS-CoV-2,"" Painter said.

Of 202 people recruited, 182 swabs could evaluated, 78 showed infection baseline. results based labs 78 participants.

By day 3, 28% patients placebo arm SARS-CoV-2 nasopharynx, compared 20.4% patients receiving dose molnupiravir. day 5, none participants receiving active drug evidence SARS-CoV-2 nasopharynx. comparison, 24% people placebo arm still detectable virus.

Halfway treatment course, differences presence infectious virus already evident. day 3 5-day course, 36.4% participants 200 mg group detectable virus nasopharynx, compared with¬†21% 400 mg group 12.5% 800 mg group. although reduction SARS-CoV-2 noticeable 200 mg 400 mg arms, statistically significant 800 mg arm.

In contrast, end 5 days placebo groups, infectious virus varied 18.2% 200 mg placebo group¬†to 30% 800 mg group. points variability disease course SARS-CoV-2.

""You know"" infections lead serious disease, Painter told¬†Medscape Medical News. ""And wish did?""

Seven participants discontinued treatment, though four experienced adverse events. Three discontinued trial due adverse events. study still blinded, unclear events were, Painter said thought related study drug.

The bottom line, said Painter, people treated molnupiravir starkly different outcomes lab measures study.

""An average 10 days symptom onset, 24% placebo patients remained culture positive"" SARS-CoV-2 ‚Äî meaning¬†there virus nasopharynx, capable replicating, Painter said.

Good old Russia. hope get modern world one day. understanding, it‚Äôs toss up. sick, coworkers it, older relatives barely bothered it. Europe, widespread serious precautions taken nations/localities. Masking widely enforced practiced, large mass gatherings exceptionally rare across continent.

This case Texas, particularly Houston. live here, people taken precautions all. near normalcy typical weekend/weekday nights many clubs, bars, restaurants, etc. 

I say note careful presuming trends places like Europe, precautions widespread, Texas Florida, not, same. 

If, example, infection original variant still provides degree protection variants (this likely case given [data vaccine effectiveness across would limit negative impact B.117 Texas Florida, simply lack precautions taken places led widespread infection. Oh god, Maryland shitshow. Hogan great balancing Covid restrictions, utterly completely failed vaccine rollout. Yup, vaccine makers anticipated target hood bumper. targeted hubcaps, axles, gas pedal, engine, etc... vaccines still work varying degrees variants. No, parent comment creating strawman. one said problem people want 3+ kids economy let them. lot people want 3+ kids, pretty well established (by polls) people typically want 2 (with 1 3 also somewhat popular options, 2 typical answer mile). See example (in Spanish).

The problem economic conditions make many people want 2 kids 1 0 instead, many (25%) people want 3 2, 1 0 instead, that's pretty big deal without need make extreme world people want lots kids. simple fact enough push fertility rate 2.something (healthy) significantly less 2 (decreasing population). that's what's happening, regardless factors (sure, 100 years ago 7 kids common -not due culture also bad birth control-, one that, that's really point. need get back healthy fertility rate).

By way, circle aquaintances full rich people giving birth like rabbits, see trend pretty clearly. People precarious jobs and/or periods unemployment - almost universally 0 kids, exceptions. People reasonable stability - 1-2 kids, people stressful jobs/long hours typically 1. know three couples 3 kids, surprise... they're indeed rather rich, stability good work conditions give (or one them) free time couples. interestingly looks like almost repeat lab study done China several months ago? 

I can't remember author, maybe team working paper. Embarrassing worker speak boss take sick time work refused take Covid vaccine, coworkers cover them. 

Not embarrassing laughing someone unwell (which seems like really odd assumption make). best way protect baby citizens simply get first vaccine offered squash transmission nearly zero instead waiting slightly better one unique circumstances

Correct, know counting vast majority people get vaccine see went asking people wear mask. work healthcare facility 60% got shot. 

Not going count fellow humans right thing. Stay home enjoy safety. take risks every time life. Thanks Biden! two years ago. newly 45 year old like news. long prevalence remains low, chances catching COVID even unvaccinated fall well. 99.96% chance likely hold get higher community spread dies down. well, number system Invented Bharat (India) kind person scrawls messages car drives around? Title slightly editorialised since knew weren‚Äôt getting full allocation while. seems expect less 850k doses third 1.25 million expected around 2 weeks ago. Would mean around 80 million total EU hundreds unvaccinated people traveling public taking precautions, seems they're putting anyone vaccinated risk. Oh irony! continue years enough people don‚Äôt get vaccine.

Again, problem UK US banning export? ones delivered EU. tell people need get vaccine qualify stimulus check. Don‚Äôt want pitch help us beat virus? go fuck off. idea downvoted. People really overstepping boundaries regard control others' lives. threat society gone everyone chance protect themselves, people allowed whatever please. 

It right American citizen endanger really want to. I'll everything power convince to, I'm waiting around longer made decision. willing vaccinated, COVID non-issue everyone anyway. UK production facilities funded set specifically UK government producing UK batches vaccine, taking orders producing vaccines countries. European production facilities were. EU lying that, discovered contract published. Ja okay. Viel Gl√ºck. üôÑ I've never wanted live side side border (and that's saying something - y'alls weed prices like third Arkansas's.) 

God damn wish bought cute ass house Westville. Seriously. India vaccinating faster (on trailing 7d- basis) EU US vaccinated around 1.6-1.7 million yesterday - yesterday first day India vaccinated highest number people world.  Yeah hoping anal swabs FL daily case numbers example seem around twice surge started whereas CA seems back pre-surge levels. FL numbers seem around 25% peak surge CA around 10% peak.

Again agree there‚Äôs lot confounding factors one going compare two states conclusion isn‚Äôt mitigation measures don‚Äôt work.   Hehe boner Time NCAA sanctions Mizzou No, could right that. could proprietary information. dozens pharmaceutical companies competing need protect information.

Ok put way, New York Times made great article tracked progress every vaccine reach EUA. wonderful, pulled every week back 2020. release proprietary information, laid steps needed take showed were, etc.

All I'm asking New York Times someone extend tracking article beyond EUA FDA Approval. article showed progress Phases 1, 2, 3. Someone thread said need complete Phase 4 Trial get FDA Approval. add step article. steps? know, that's I'm asking. Im 32. None states close allowing vaccinate yet. Though agree dont care get long get one theme parks literally tens thousands works. Disneyland alone 32,000. Disney gets money box office parks. extremely limited last year. hanging thread Disney+. really don‚Äôt money support workers even big are. tried beginning months better most. 

Where getting idea Disney ‚Äùwasn‚Äôt willing‚Äù support workers? 

Also, market cap nothing company‚Äôs assets. It‚Äôs value total stock. Tesla one biggest marker caps world barely make profit. End day matters vaccines shown virtually eliminate severe COVID. Nothing 100%. efficacy based contracting covid. Furthermore, JJ tested variants, mRNA vaccines not. really don‚Äôt know mRNA‚Äôs efficacy numbers new strains. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs quite good anyways still. Nah! think okay :). prepared headache chills worse. Way go! Looking person's profile, pretty clear they're everything inject far right leaning views sub, mostly misunderstanding misrepresenting statistics well maybe start going door door old folks get done house? intuitive sense scale risk, 40 years old Illinois likely died automobile accident given year COVID duration pandemic. higher risk switches 40-45 bracket. know know tell me. That's There's enough protection severe disease death Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, Novavax vaccines worry vaccine escape future variant.

Yeah no. That's vaccinations work definitely mutations work. actually trying learn concern-trolling, here's interview CDC director directly contradicting bad suspect already know respond maybe one day I'll wrong message boards. Biden administration walked plan vaccine distribution spend last 2 months snatching acquiring enough vaccine.

Then US already vaccinated people rate higher like three countries world then? LOL pretty stupid travel country wants detain 7 days despite fully vaccinated showing negative test. want beaches, Seychelles Mexico open visitors. using test goes nose? I'm glad I'm British student. I'm assuming probably people eligible based profession check actually key worker jumping queue moved vulnerable. point needs opened groups. There‚Äôs much obsession prioritization political points. Dr. Olsterholm 

well man BA Political Science awfully political it. mean, could apply literally anything else. Kids die vending machines, could easily ban vending machines, would good idea though? No, enough kids die worth caring need open people, point think Plateaued people 65 2 months schedule appointment haven‚Äôt yet that‚Äôs mostly besides instances. going 60+ 55+ now. Similar experience Moderna. back soreness well today, usually sleep side, since shoulder tender, maybe twisted funny. overall seems pretty similar get flu shot, maybe slightly sore. Still much prefer alternative though! Antivax nonsense. Reported multiple rule violations. Putting kids first... sky come crashing down!?

Kudos them, say! small rural population also got lucky. anecdotal information considered viable source. feel dead. care disclose. Experts aren‚Äôt sure % people need populated get herd immunity low estimates 60‚Äôs. Regardless, vary regionally US. Places northeast west coast probably upwards 80% (once get children) areas south vaccine hesitancy may reach herd immunity virus could become endemic threat rest world mutates (less likely though).

Good getting vaccinated protected others. However, community high vaccine hesitancy, need make clear friends refusal get vaccine continue put others risk. Maybe feel fluish get (or could worse) could continue cause community spread people also refused community. could include maybe stubborn elderly people people undiagnosed conditions put risk. refusing vaccine relying herd immunity others likely already communities struggle ever reach herd immunity. I‚Äôve flu three times life (every 10 years so) reason virus kicks ass. rarely get sick otherwise, usually one cold year max, overall pretty healthy. see posts link actual facts downvoted often. shit. Swimming vaccine? sell Canada go back seeing people person fucking zoom.

Sell mexico, sure need to!

Sell Europe since two biggest vaccine providers already underperforming shipments europe. That's them. talking approving modified mRNA vaccines targeting variants without phase 3 trials, far stupid approving vaccine built 100 year old platform phase 3 study different population (they approve parallel bridging study need be).

Bharat Biotech trying part get US approvals enlisting US firms like IQVIA carry phase 3 trials build confidence process.

If US decides approve it, want protect market foreign competition - makes scientific logical sense. Sure, dare expect employer look employees, many sunk entire lives company. relative elsewhere, yes course.


relative distribution agree others pretty disappointing Mass revolt restrictions, imagine coming Israel reach 75% vaccination rate. vaccines? think anyone really say. Pfizer Moderna trials new variants lab studies show still work. whether still offers efficiency new variant known Usually happens somewhere, area moves next priority group. that, failed meet potential.  **An** Easter. poke me, baby.

I stranger penetrate johnson^^^^^and.Johnson Saturday 11 a.m.! incredible. observance day Canadians died cancer, drug overdose, heart disease? Nope.

Let rest us get quickly protect dumbasses themselves. get April figure? state fast, still won‚Äôt vaccinating people 35 May per official timeline. mention every person 35 vaccinated May date, either people couldn‚Äôt secure appointment people refuse vaccine. old vulnerable vaccinated reason continue restrictions whatsoever. Anecdotally, dad second shot scheduled today canceled face decreased supply rescheduled day. might lot people reschedule. state website keeps saying appointment dates. finally got appointment week CVS.

I'm one people. actually concerned health others everything get vaccine. messaging encouragement needed. hadn‚Äôt thought before. Good point! also huge disappointment competitors wanted support loved ones. 

Also, every event aired? I‚Äôve never looked obscure events before. aren‚Äôt, wonder organizers set events live streamed loved ones. 

However, one last thought, sucks, chance games wouldn‚Äôt happen *at all.* would sucked even more, esp. one shot. would information available? guess would proprietary? they've released needed EUA, doubt would voluntarily release information. could wrong though...

to clarify - think simply need data FDA approval. information pharma firms incredibly confidential. see would necessarily public information yet. ETA *I received shots and* still wear mask time small office (7 people) although wish decided bubble (nobody else wears mask client arrive.) Pissed royally everyone risk (mean age 65) spouse works restaurant sucks wearing mask best times.   Good news! actually enforcing masks worn outdoors? Must absolutely awful entire family vaccinated, yet forced wear mask street. referring asylum seekers? majority let - 25,000 waiting Mexican shelters. they're letting vetted tested, usually at-risk people pregnant mothers children. asylum issue separate COVID issue.

How long Phase 4 Trial take whole world threw tons resources it, like previous trials?

Once Phase 4 Trial complete, anything else must get FDA Approval?

By way, impossible. flu shot took October FDA Approved. assume meant FDA Approval impossible short amount time. Sorry pedantic.

1) Mitigation extremely important. ""fuck it, I've already lost"" attitude wrong one. best place stop binging tub Ben Jerry's wherever realize making mistake. set back week single binge. set back months month two apathy. Even yo-yo dieting, much hate gets, prevents steady rise weight gain makes getting shape real much easier.

2) Count calories. overweight, almost definitely hungry even crossing calorie threshold day. People think eat ""healthy"" full lose weight. successful weightloss journey involve going bed rumbling stomach time time.

3) Lift weights dieting ensure losing fat. also fantastic motivator see fitness progress quickly hard numbers.

4) Alcohol basically completely incompatible weight loss. highly caloric beverage makes even hungrier. dieting, even single glass wine dinner made hitting calorie goals much, much harder.

5) Meal prep. Also, stuff like intermittent fasting/OMAD actually works decently well.

It sucks. live world set failure. hope see sort action society (i.e. complete rejection unhealthy foods), ultimately control ourselves. Newsom recall looks like go vote. Newsom may try opening things aggressively slow momentum pull attention that. CNN needs work harder keep fear absolutely right. I'm advocating numbers.

Italy far tell searches one stockpiling AZ countries trust it, reason get mad aspect. many countries AZ trusted like others, noticed, EU one country, populations differ wildly comes trusting certain vaccines believing certain believes, think Australia Indonesia difference instance Netherlands Italy (culture wise), two completely different countries.

Also matter hard country hit/ currently hit? Bringing vaccine worse hit place would obviously save lives, kinda understand Italy prioritize Australie way then.

I get mad, would AUS, real fuck AZ, understand EU gets blame company promised big time creates political pressure unrest countries bunch AZ (supposed) produced here, factories operated people within EU EU soil. see shit happening places too, like USA, export ban first 100 million Pfizer doses produced there, difference Pfizer competent people top huge issues would otherwise create problems. I'm sure think going happen shit reopens activities become available them? get sick fine die. sacrifice majority go back normal. That‚Äôs false positive though? Unless mean it‚Äôs falsely positive news, case would good news herd immunity closer. person Reddit actually used Zoom whole thing hit? really goes poutine? Meanwhile parents, late 60s health issues STILL waiting first shot South Florida. Trump vaccinations barely started.

Are biased can't recognise absolutely heroic government action literally life death? government tells something mean correct. They're estimating based week's shipments, that's do. next week comes get twice many doses, they'll adjust timelines accordingly. Lockdowns terrible experiment hope never try again. sounds like conscientious person 1 percent huge time always feel bad get combo make people squirt ends. side effects? get mine tomorrow trying give ya little hope. first shot chills slight headache later night. Also little super tired. Heard second shots side effects worse nervous are. However, got second round nothing! chills nothing. Felt great! here‚Äôs hoping similar experience. never understood people. hate wearing mask work 8 hours every day. gets wet breathing, itchy, exhale deeply get blasted moisture, know deal. course I'm gonna it, employer state say to.

This doesn‚Äôt surprise much seemingly everything partisan US nowadays, Republicans likely believe conspiracy theories, leadership downplaying severity virus year now. 

My question though divide cause problems distribution? course large differences party affiliation across different regions country mean demand vaccines vary too. hope Republican states willing share doses others demand dries first. ohio‚Äôs supply must increasing pretty well. vaccine rollout started january, ages 65+ couldn‚Äôt get til early february. last week opened 60+ year olds taken 6 days lower threshold 50+. look forward getting weeks. Wow, yet we‚Äôre prioritized less portion population obese. Glad able get otherwise, bad underweight people back line almost makes ""sports fans trash town team wins championship"" look good comparison

almost 1 percent?  read New Zealand wonder country makes fucking sense I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll great, could possible go wrong? It‚Äôll fix everything, right? all, future ahead me.

And since altzheimers runs family won‚Äôt remember time they‚Äôre crumbling apart 30s. It‚Äôs win win me. kid? Ehh problem. Good riddance Given number asymptomatic cases, seems like would hard confirm?   would incredible. hostel London throwing shared bathroom like 3 hours. Idk catch anything ya like watching rich people get tax breaks ppp loans people without job health insurance get vaccine? 

Do die survive economic repercussions covid? already moved up, thought saw Mid May mentioned day. bet gets bumped April. there's large difference quality life vaccinated not. younger generally unvaccinated population put high risk well, also turn increases chance vaccine escape. side effects? get mine tomorrow Antibody tests show 1-2 months believe  yeah go. testing disaster (and still IMO) needed almost critical condition tested. 

meanwhile low-symptom aysmptomatic spreaders passing around far faster could track (contact tracing another disaster)  74lbs. Wow. know hard amazed!

Best luck. Arm hard rock? lasted 4 hours? Maybe arm injected different Pfizer product. Well that's great sneer since OP referring fall. sure right answer is, saw admissions starting fall late January, drew line best fit added weeks booked trip Hawaii May. Got great deal January 14th. 6 days biden office. 951,000 vaccinations one plan 100 million vaccinations first 100 days. 1 million per day. exactly lofty goal 1.5M/day inauguration day.  happen billions years, rate human growth either grow encompass entire universe point beyond, longgg gone haha Imagine convinced effectiveness something European CDC says ‚Äúsmall moderate‚Äù effect, supported ‚Äúlow moderate‚Äù quality evidence cut dry death increase appears Virginia. huge dumps deaths last week, added something like 4000 deaths December/January. worldometers.info get active cases? We've 100k daily cases USA month yet somehow still says 8M active cases. Surely tested positive month ago longer ""active"" case. There's well less 3M new cases last 30 days. numbers make sense? You‚Äôre peasant, so, course. Yeah. We'll plenty years need though! words, lie fear pandemic avoid spending time people dislike? Yeah I'm gonna go ahead say they're probably better seeing more. emotional maturity level low can't say ""I want spend time you"" without lying, probably best friend even outside pandemic. end May see large portion population vaccinated. There's guarantee everyone coming could get vaccine time though.

June July would almost guaranteed, May really important might want wait next year. means vaccines stole us, produced private company every right sell wherever want. Lol. Dude. don‚Äôt even agree business closures. wearing mask easiest thing person limit infectious disease Americans still much pricks lol. fun supporting inhumane dictators rest life. lovely day. Idiots ^ 3 explicitly telling us things like ‚Äúyou absolutely still transmit you‚Äôre vaccinated‚Äù? 


Can link source? 

Because remember reading saying, ‚Äúwe dont know transmit it‚Äù First dose kicking ass rn, hope second hit worse Many people understand probabilities. assume vaccines ""work"" every time, resulting zero infections. information 95% infections prevented surprises confuses them.  people even misinterpret 5% residual infection rate ""proof"" vaccines work all.  concept efficacy rate, need explained public many times coming months. I‚Äôm starting think mass protests college students thing going get college experience education back. Especially states. 

Aside that, admin going fine dragging forever nebulous goal ‚Äúsafety‚Äù. know they‚Äôve got students barrel. Well. curve spiking September January . Sure buddy. Perhaps. feel like groceries supplies overblown medication monthly. good chunk healthy, especially single kids, need lot make month. Let's real Good chance we'll get rid it. hospitalizations looking med center? Okay?
The idea variants crazy now.
Has anyone told every vaccine booster research facility this? Sincerely doubt it. actual infection rate far higher cases confirmed positive tests. Damn missed things preventable infectious diseases. Sure, explicitly telling us things like ""you absolutely still transmit vaccinated""? That's pretty definitive statement group still taking time get data study effects. CDC political motivations later phases.

Most states started prioritize immunocompromised seniors includes immunocompromised essential workers well high risk complications.

It's really good model healthy people ahead asthma COPD. Wow mask mandate fall vaccines widely available several months nuts. mean, think changed then, won‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely we‚Äôll see revolt might die tomorrow though. We‚Äôre crushing curve. ‚ÄúFlattening curve‚Äù supposed different. really worked all. I'm thousands people using sharing scripts watch updates every vaccine provider's website town, apparently providers explicitly instructed ask people group they're in.

If main concern jumping line, might've effective enforce checks people's vaccine group lie public vaccine's efficacy. nah think states audacity open businesses back up. Oh good god. Rhetoric like big reason people turning mandates suffer rest days alone agony.  ... India come‚Äôs through. Definitely hero country pandemic. üëèüëèüëè date information moderna vaccine eliciting t-cells? find lots info summer early fall saying Pfizer elicited cd4+ cd8+, everything see moderna time period provides either vague ambiguous info, says point didn‚Äôt, elicits cd4+ cd8+. seems kind weird can‚Äôt find much anything date it. Would reasonable assume would actually elicit similar t-cell response Pfizer? Thanks! lockdowns mask mandates ourselves. Quit whining lmao. manufacture vaccines get first. many J+J expected far? low actively suppressing unlike non contagious diseases. let guard lot people vaccinated, we're awesome job far! Sure nice see travel industry profit newly vaccinated people rest us wait get shots, deal w variants somehow scrape together living midst crisis. nice. You‚Äôre right. didn‚Äôt mandate it. people weren‚Äôt selfish dicks anyway. mandate wasn‚Äôt necessary. Ngl totally support vaccines plan get one, idea cheering government authority create formalized societal tiers incredibly fucking creepy. 

I'm planning wait high-risk people essential workers mostly spoken for; seems wrong formally designated second class citizen taking vaccine someone whose life significant danger could've had. Mass started seeing sharp drop cases hospitalizations starting well even started rolling vaccine out. Strangely, drop slowed recently vaccinations starting ramp up. week see dramatic declines daily deaths US? actually did, Jan data Italy already showing this. go you‚Äôll probably fine. Especially outdoors. mean 16 days first dose? Oklahoma actually ahead curve! NA nations done lifting citizens, state health department also done good job around. 

Phase 3 includes huge number people. We've done care home residents, front line medical, 65, 55+ medical issues, teachers already. Phase 3 includes pretty much everyone else works public whatever deemed ""essential"" work. small portion adults state left phase 4, pretty much opening almost adults. knowing full well vaccine supply increasing massively rapidly. everything bad news. Fair point, well made. advice get ahead curve. Like think would‚Äôve felt better chugged pedialyte beforehand? issue... need üòÅ Last time went doctor nurse asked I'd taken drinking drugging since last time she'd seen me. said hadn't, however sure thought starting smoke get vaccine sooner, decided asthma approve.  already toddler version rioting anyway Ending pandemic protecting vulnerable related different goals.

It‚Äôs like Texas people. always thought this. matter bad fuck planet always handful humans persevere somehow. Ages 1-5 best years life. joke. would taken year get every household month groceries, supplies medication. vaccine made Pfizer German partner BioNTech, shipped vials initially indicated hold five doses. Six doses drawn special syringes, call low dead space, minimize amount vaccine left syringe use.

And draw 7.

Let's say 1 vial Pfizer. use 7 extract vaccine.

The article say used multiple times.

What's confusion? Yep. Stressed much can't even sleep another couple months everybody else gets vaccine. control sustainable way (aka vaccines), time let vaccinated tourists guide lists countries, read still allow tourists. That's gonna happening while, especially countries contained it. Lucky! Republican voters: ""The state can't enforce mask bans! let businesses decide!""

**businesses decide keep masks**

Republican voters: ""Noo cant that!""  Wait... would invent multi use syringe??? We're already middle one public health crisis, actively chasing second??? haven't. mean, least White Sox, 20% attendance pretty much average attendance throughout year games....so much would change there... Summit County Utah opened 40 vaccines today. Utah vaxed willing teachers first wave, weeks ago. kicking ass taking names - 30% pop age vaccines data shows achieving everyone uses total population percentages. Also supplied one fastest growing states data used allocation old.

 high percentage obese people know it. also ridiculously low non-white populations - highest visible fatality rate identifier weight. 

They looked data also asked hospitals dying hospitals said overweight people leading visible indicator poor outcomes death.   

It's awkward, flawed data science, politically imperfect Utah likely first state two million people fully vaccinated (for willing) schools restaurants open month zero fatalities.

If go vaccine tab select metric drop menu pick third option, see breakdown age. Unfortunately ‚Äúbetter average‚Äù still leaves lot room improvement; Washington 57% average less half, it‚Äôs really debatable thing, 57% 50%  much % usa population much % world population need vaccinate order get back normal life ? Experts also said vaccines years away getting 2021 fantasy. 

Trust doctors. Trust scientist. also people, gut feeling hope optimism. track news data regularly disagree. That‚Äôs okay too. people human. truth nobody time machine future. We‚Äôre figuring month month. Look peaks troughs hospitalizations cases. match exact dates. Hospitalizations best measure get snapshot US currently at. Eclectic Boogerglue Vaccinate everyone twice? Yeah, people resilient others either. def wits' end going denial. panic attack nowhere yesterday, real bad one, anxiety disorder counseling cope years, eventually pulled back together. panicking first time ever pandemic well. feeling sympathy people going minds right now.

We really need public mental health guidance much physical health guidance crisis. nicely put. good reasons think force anyone decision. set mRNA others want Johnson Johnson various combinations benefits nicely laid out. many others simply care. problem people wanting Johnson Johnson vaccine. beats me, usually name virus Tourette‚Äôs. Maryland. Northern Virginia way behind well. stuck 11-15% rural areas approaching 25%. hate say looks like racial disparities medical systems government blame. Minorities getting vaccinated half rate white people according Virginia Department Health. Hospitalizations lag case counts, too. much deaths lag. test positive, need hospitalized immediately. correct, read study deeply enough posted poor part. appreciate pointing 75% probably won‚Äôt achieve herd immunity it?

As others ITT noted, there's also 28 million confirmed U.S. cases (really 28.6 million, 520k fatal.) 28MM would add another 8.5% American public COVID, recovered it, developed level antibodies.

It's also widely believed quite Americans COVID make official numbers, early cases never got tested. hard say number assign -- I've seen estimates anywhere 1/10 official count, another 2.8MM, **4 times** official count roughly 112 million Americans. personally, would find plausible ""real"" number reflect half many cases official count, extra 14MM cases. would add another 4.2% American public.

So, 75% adult Americans, [themselves comprise 76% -- that's 57% grand total. Figure another ~12% antibodies infection, gets us 69% (nice). probably get us hump vaccines safely given minors.  going damn expensive Sure, could said people going business still open, including grocery stores.

It pretty clear distinction essential like grocery store, isn't. Want mRNA lowest chances infecting 10 month old baby. It‚Äôs personal outcome. completely clear; I‚Äôd take available approved vaccine. point pandemic, one dose regimen vaccine huge benefit. Less syringes, less production capacity used, less vial glass half impact capacity use health care systems administering doses. don‚Äôt come back second dose additional bonus. Nice! Let know side effects, minor ones. vaccine? Yup 1 million doses/day last week 300-400K doses/day 2 weeks ago

You see progression I'm 1000% okay that. Whatever happens them...happens them. right die. Doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre good place. Nope, originally 100 million Q1. changed targets ended delivering 10. 10% new target 40 million doses end March still half British-Swedish company originally aimed Exactly. Another 30% herd immunity begins kick in. That's end May! it. Thanks bro! Even don‚Äôt end hospital, don‚Äôt want likely pass virus unvaccinated kids. Yeh but.... Oxford /AZ shot bad? 99.7% survival rate, math pretty bad there. assume 100% infection rate drastic reversal virus quite safe worse gun shot. 

The likely formula something like 25% Americans willing risk 10% chance year acquiring virus 40% chance asymptomatic 0.03% chance death.

1/10 * 2/5 * 3/1000 = 6/50000

So 25% Americans willing face 0.012% chance death rather take experimental vaccine approved FDA, rather given emergency authorization following rushed development using novel vaccine protocol (mRNA).

But know, get internet points. did. Evidentally, Florida cases third two months ago deaths nearly cut half month prior lives pause year second dose appointment really issue? understand sub. treatments developed. death rate fallen drastically since beginning least rudimentary knowledge treat people.

1. One &amp; Done. second appointment BS. People willing / able travel it, since once.
2. 'Full Immunity' *2* weeks vs. *5* (I know efficacy vs. ""severe covid"" goes slightly day 14 day 28 J&amp;J, case efficacy actually falls two percentage points, believe CDC officially calls 14 days 'fully vaccinated' J&amp;J, essentially 'get back life' 3 weeks sooner J&amp;J vs mRNA vaccines...)
3. strong possibility ensemble 3 study (studying two doses believe 12 weeks apart?) shows two doses increases efficacy near efficacy mRNA vaccines. Therefore, likely 'booster' available sometime late summer / fall. get majority protection *now*, quickly might add, still end getting efficacy Moderna Pfizer vaccine *eventually*. BS Damn science! got 2nd shot today. told side effects would harsher mine milder far 99 degree fever appeared within hours last time. We'll see feel tomorrow. It‚Äôs half 65+ population gotten least one dose Washington, it‚Äôs ~57% last Friday, we‚Äôre much better nation‚Äôs average Washington getting doses 65+ people. Granted, even 57%, there‚Äôs lot people waiting still, far prioritizing elderly, Washington quite well comparatively I'll preface pointing **correlation**, **causation**. Places opened restaurants likely things may contributed increased COVID spread.

Anyway, math:

1. opening restaurants, study shows 0.9% increase 41-60 days after, 1.2% increase 61-80 days after, 1.1% increase 81-100 days after.
2. **Assuming** 0% case growth control, 0% case growth 0-39 days after...

If started 1,000 cases/day, would expect 100,000 total cases 100 days.

Doing math 40 days 0% growth, 0.9%/1.2%/1.1% growth 20 days (total 100 days), end 123,471 total cases, **23.5% increase total cases** 100 days.

**True statement**: Counties opened restaurants \~23.5% total cases/population counties open restaurants 100 days.

**Not-true statement**: Opening restaurants *caused* case numbers counties \~23.5% higher would otherwise.

P.S. anyone wants double-check math, note study used natural logs, cases increasing e\^(0.009) 1.009 days 41-60, etc. far prefer receive J&amp;J vaccine due one dose regimen. One appointment done. Easier me, better use resources society. think real world difference RNA vaccines J&amp;J much smaller efficacy difference. I‚Äôd might get coronavirus runny nose, people RNA vaccine still get runny nose virus. comes chance hospitalization, death, long covid transmission virus seen difference effect approved vaccine like seventh inning stretch, take ballgame. seriously, take ballgame! I'm Canadian...... Could imagine 127 million doses could country right now? like blame authoritarian Asshole politicans point . promised 53.5m, going produce 50m domestically procure *3.5 million* doses overseas sources. That's little bit less 550,000. promised 40m, fact promised AZ would make best reasonable efforts produce 40m. make efforts. succeed. None allows steal fucking vaccines. It'd eventually die months ravaging major population centers. small towns avoid altogether. military takes police departments fail. choose burn bodies mass graves.

They stopped putting people risk did. deal AZ signed August last year EU waited later setup parts supply chain. deal Novasep produce AZ vaccines plant Seneffe, Belgium signed November point start getting things setup let alone start production. 

Pfizer said start finish takes 100 days manufacture batch vaccines. everything setup running. Vector vaccines take even longer make. AZ Novasep get things setup could start manufacturing. Getting point able manufacture takes time even difficult produce scale.

The UK started setting production facilities almost year ago problems. got sorted took recently able produce numbers. around six month head start plant Belgium still problems time sort out. 

Delivery problems arent limited AZ. Pfizer due deliver 10m doses UK end 2020. managed deliver 500k managed deliver 5% supposed to. 

The EU setup supply chain later others like UK US hurting now. Laying blame feet AZ European Commissions way deflecting blame away really lies them.

I've got news ya. Every day US people freedom endanger lives others. That's pretty much operate. Hey I'll let know months, yeah? we're seniors hs. best friend super smart used rlly well school. however, parents quite controlling (don't even let go outside anymore fucking sucks, scream daily, etc etc). mental health 0. grades tanking. parents cutting wifi (IN ONLINE SCHOOL) overall...it's hell.

This true two weeks ago, since deaths infections dropping rapidly. Reopening large events probably slow somewhat, rapid vaccine rollout acquired immunity huge number people already virus enough counter it.  Good luck! u write article?

That‚Äôll 55,000... pull ER please Yeah, wonderful EU. Like Italy seizing vaccines meant Australia. noble honorable. people give honest help follow advice. probably see comment mad since got removed mods. every right angry, get say emotions.

I'm following advice parent getting vaccine within week. focusing negative response bully Considering replaced contactless delivery front door, really essential. really, bottleneck currently amount vaccines have, demand. makes sense vaccinate need first know - Europe still smugly scoffing Americans many countries slow vaccine roll outs.

And rich countries. without accurate reporting wealthy health systems woods either. Teachers, school bus drivers, day care workers school staff also receive vaccine right regardless age. really hard find open time slot Maine moment group.

If 60 plus though find slot open ease would surprised move 50 plus April 1st rate going. one comments:

People present one dose regimen JnJ advantage vaccines like Pfizer's. advantage. Pfizer's vaccine offers almost identical protection symptomatic covid severe disease one shot shown UK people getting one shot right now. JnJ opted give one dose, Pfizer well UK does. 

Also, getting booster shot decreases duration immunity. Booster shots increase antibody titers manyfold compared priming shot make memory last longer. 

JnJ's shorter regimen weaker effects. That's fact. may sensible strategy goal protect many people possible UK postponed second doses reason, present JnJ's vaccination regimen innovative sophisticated one-dose one&amp;""done"" misleading. really done. vaccines already fucking obsolete, frustrating.

They're year old means whole year goddamned virulent virus mutate uncontrollably. restrictions around countries etc travelled to. goes bit says even countries travelled good excuse meant terms 'you make anyone them'. doses administered right away, exaggerating mainly administrative problem. still enough people would gladly take AZ chance shortages, example. Indiana dropped 60 55 55 50 span 2 days r/COVID-19 pretty strict. got perma-banned fast commenting wearing mask dick thread SARS-CoV-2 detected semen always take condom right ejaculation...

This advantage. Pfizer's vaccine offers almost identical protection symptomatic covid severe disease one shot shown UK people getting one shot right now. JnJ opted give one dose, Pfizer well UK does. 

Also, getting booster shot decreases duration immunity. Booster shots increase antibody titers manyfold compared priming shot make memory last longer.

That's fact. may sensible strategy goal protect many people possible UK postponed second doses reason, present JnJ's vaccination regimen innovative sophisticated one-dose one&amp;""done"" misleading. really done. Frankly, UK US kill free trade national interest, EU opinion. We're unfortunately, otherwise PR nightmare.

The EU stolen vaccines payed full received tiny amount. stealing, like skipping queue. anecdote, friend SF vaccinated recently. said waiting 10 hours almost last list, said get 20 people vaccinated night, going vaccinate anybody. found three people eligible building went friend got vaccinated. Canada stole vaccines funds developing countries. nothing praise understanding Exactly. EXACT THOUGHT. True. parents eligible get appointments, can't get any. So, I'm boat. Instead eligible one yet. love pandemic respect haven‚Äôt played since pandemic began.

I'm sure I'm missing something infections work article explain properly, I'm trouble understanding higher replication rate could good thing. infection severity correlate viral load? increase mutation rate too?

For sake making numbers easier, let's say normal infection virus would replicate rat 1000/day mutation rate makes nonviable around 1 million virus mark (i.e.: would take 1000 days virus burn naturally, time either long-recovered dead). medication increases replication rate 1000x, hit 1 million virus mark day - 1 million viruses floating around bloodstream?

Can't wait mass boomer dieoff, maybe we'll able salvage wreckage. are. 

Remind me, companies wanted South American counties put sovereign assets collateral order agree sell vaccine? Thats surprising different experience have. People around skeptical changed tune feels impossible even get vaccine. Trump nothing vaccine development.

Operation Warp Speed appear somewhat beneficial terms early distribution efforts. bottom line vaccines safe vast majority people. That‚Äôs story. fuckkk, I'm bummed.

I dont technically doctor moment, know overweight.

So youll get sometime April guess got second shot weeks ago still happily wear mask day work everywhere go, maintain appropriate distance (eat lunch side room car alone), practice good hygiene (washing hands, touching face, etc.). I've got problem wearing mask, especially helps even one person interact given day feel little less stressed.

I ditch face shield wearing full shift though, since I've got large protective shield window customers I. much I'm thankful for, mine getting scratched up. 4th July three day weekend companies.

This year, particular, Sunday. we'll get Super Bowl treatment. Everyone gets drunk expected show work next day  don‚Äôt hoard it, give many countries possible, allies adversaries. need stop spreading prevent mutating more. mutates much, vaccines we‚Äôre currently using might effective could right back square one. I‚Äôm hawaii Yeap. Thanks clarification education workers. I‚Äôm surprised none news sources state education employees need. Sounds like word getting around anyway, that‚Äôs good news. 

I think state sees form way prevent liar‚Äôs free all, seems like doctors note relevant data (name, license, etc.) sufficient. Maybe FL way help doctor‚Äôs standardize?

I idea... Florida cagey entire time. don‚Äôt even published plan, know? Shaq there? EU exporting around 1/3 vaccines currently produced 30 countries. don‚Äôt N95 bunch KN95, would still safe? really benefit you, general consensus we'll avert death serious illness protect vulnerable vaccinating directly, vaccinating likely carriers. Another swing, another miss! uncanny! get feeling another one way! 
Ok GO!!!! also Pfizer booster J&amp;J shot vice versa. There‚Äôs central database tracking got vaccinated one stop you. wait there‚Äôs enough supply everyone. Yeah but, evidenced jingoism, programmed them. Wait...can antibodies tranfer kissing?  Come u/moofninja sexy vaccinated fool, you! seems like even mentioning ‚Äúpersonal risk assessment‚Äù makes lot people think see virus hoax, wonder they‚Äôre gonna make everyone another year protect kids. What's deal Chezcia? vaccinated lot people. assume almost 70+ vaccinated. many people dying??? vaccinating young people sth like that? Sure, totally normal. get vaccines without ""connections"" almost anywhere.

You call local pharmacy early afternoon see missed appointments/extra doses day. Pfizer/Moderna, vials opened need used same-day, vials remaining end day need thrown out.

Some would argue morally correct thing try get those, prevent wasted vaccines speed distribution much possible. stepping front anyone else needed more, since going trashed otherwise. couple friends (late 20's/early 30's, underlying health conditions) gotten early vaccines this. Oh, personally, agree well. took message say permissive. think OP justified cautious pregnancy (and line particular: older adults, **pregnant**, certain medical conditions, etc.), think getting together would fine well.  make vaccines Canada

This pretty weak argument. Chile, UAE EU countries also produce vaccines way ahead Canada. Israel seeing drop cases vaccine prevents transmission? new cases 50% lower peak, percentage people immune vaccines past infections. guess possibility would actually massive wave vaccine, though. anybody looked rigorously? correct, plan - qualify ""we'll make states deal distribution"" plan. Hey, you. Get N95 pretty much safe. I'll also add, current phase system WA second one implemented. scrapped previous system cases spikes fall. entire thing absolutely discretion governor. data support another round. Florid got rid restrictions MONTHS ago numbers (per capita) look worse California locked like crazy.

I realize overall Reddit hive-mind doom&amp;gloom know media loves bad news really see next round coming. case rate falling fast, cannot due vaccinations alone. We're barely 10% population. said Indiana, Michigan. Unfortunately routine large companies contract social media image management companies (source: personally know people work companies though totally honest ones know J&amp;J client.) selling vaccine fat profit selling cost?

Doesn't matter, point actually saving lives. care make profit long give vaccine asked, thus saving lives. BioNTech vaccine help AZ one, least EU.

And selling cost excuse AZ CEO's cuntish behaviour remarks, actually proven false multiple times over. Say - cases anymore.

The elderly comorbid increasingly protected.

H1n1 100M cases. Hospitals overwhelmed, people die big numbers. end month. okay recognize fucked things literally 30, 60, 90 days ago news would considered positive?

Maybe okay both. That‚Äôs true all. CDC guidance specifically says vaccinated people gather low risk unvaccinated people. Kids are, statistically, low risk gets. suggest read article posted link - actually read it, - gain better understanding educated people think going on. conveniently forget progress made vaccines. Look, want hide house forever, guest. I‚Äôm going play game things statistically looking better 6 months continuing get better. gives excuse sit around home get fat. could blamed laziness. use excuse active quarantining ""saving humanity"" Oh relax ChIlD aBuSe BS. Like, come on. ONE abusing kids keeping safe.

Fucking hell. laugh keep crying. 

So laughing Brazil India well? see situation world saddened empathic, saying laugh countries things bad? laugh, 93 year old grandpa outdrink me. He's 2 weeks second vaccine ready throw documented spreader events traced back air travel. mean media many times repackaged articles citing lab studies show reduced vaccine effectiveness South African variant? one thing people don‚Äôt seem get... Pfizer it‚Äôs question another booster J&amp;J won‚Äôt happen summer bring effectiveness higher... fact that‚Äôs exactly scenario Fauci outlined recently. Eventually easy get flu shot, go get one, it‚Äôs get one can. Well pandemic rolled without lot hype (which mistake) would make sense would go without lot hype (which probably right choice) Well keep mind another reason deaths dropping high percentage population already caught virus. It‚Äôs likely number confirmed cases isn‚Äôt even close actual number. also big shitty company CEO seem nearly cuntish CEO AZ, least there's hope.

Remind selling vaccine fat profit selling cost? mean yeah that‚Äôs joke. Except do. Every encounter first responder etc. increases risk adverse event them. want face risks, quit.

There broad social compacts make help navigate communal lives. Every pandemic playbook prior COVID stressed need maintain much normal life possible, economic, social, emotional reasons. ignored playbooks acted fear. moralizing change fact. countries (incl. US), ""lockdowns"" even lockdowns. strong suggestions pretty please stay home, supported closure businesses incentivised going out. never Italy levels lockdown people actually needed documentation walk outside, certains groups people acted like did.

It's like getting hit spitball class claiming victim brutal beating. agree 3-4 weeks second shot. Big thesaurus. correct. good news pretty much doesn‚Äôt apply families underage kids, still need stay much possible there‚Äôs vaccine children available. 

All means Thanksgiving Christmas gatherings probably go year families don‚Äôt children. im saying got big pop numbers June July last year much larger base infection year. Statistically, expect another wave.  Hell ya. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll least two months behind czar newsom. ""convenience fee"" people opt vaccinated instead presenting negative tests. wait people find J&amp;J viral vector.  right now? JnJ tested SA SA strain found effective. relax. great see countries reopening, I'm incredibly skeptical idea need require vaccine passports travel. Ideally end 2021 need requirements whole world access vaccine, requirement probably stay anyway.

Even well-intentioned requirement, I'm uneasy precedent set. could see current smoker what's reasoning light smoker quit decades ago? lungs return back state non-smoker point thought. Im saying, get kids local parks, wear masks, social distancing, stay away people choose. keep house long?

I go hiking trails, play disc golf woods, go local parks, never walk near anyone else all. dont understand ""keep kids inside 100% time"" tactic thats ok dont understand it, assume think best allowed see fit  figure going take least decade unwind states lying thier numbers. That's odd. white collar job I've had, we've always gotten weekday July 4th weekend. checked current company July 5 off. hardly get holidays off. explanations... earlier outbreaks (especially Italy), older populations (again especially Italy big issue even beyond covid).

Europe also less options respond healthcare systems capacity average smaller US.

The US also quite honestly way money throw problem. chose to.

The US would responded quite differently disease impacted people less melanin worked white collar jobs rather inverse.

Sourced directly article. administration missing EVERY SINGLE goal nice fair balanced article failures Trump administration. say plan--is fine, inaccurate. say actual federal response, laughably inaccurate.

I think totally missed point there. Please lie, absolutely sorry uncle that's fine. He's statistic best never meet care. However keep saying 99.7% death negative outcome covid. one example means 99.7% number missing point.

The 95% seems reasonable since takes account personal measures people take avoid Covid. 

When fully vaccinated, difficult know exactly much risk take. hang friends' children indoors without masks even adults vaccinated? wait kids vaccinated too?

What eating indoors restaurants? coffee shops? 

Lots questions right vaccinated unvaccinated people interact. Ah yes, YouTube video great proof claim. think Earth flat too? plenty videos YouTube people claim is. biggest hurdle moment scheduling. Many older folks people without reliable internet access harder time finding vaccines. 

Here Ohio, old folks waiting notified doctor hospital system. abysmal failure. parents vaccinated 2 weeks ago persistent proactive hunted appt. Meanwhile, father 70, Diabetes + cancer STILL contacted Cleveland Clinic (2nd best hospital country). 

A 65 year old friend mine contacted today hospital (University Hospital system) told eligible. already booked vaccination local pharmacy. 

If persistent moderately tech-savvy... difficult. Luckily, everyone know (including myself) ""hunting"" vaccines less techie friends/family/acquaintances.

Yep, herd immunity. equal number vaccinated COVID. I'm saying equally immune, people highly unlikely get short term. factors drastically reducing spread. okay think positive news? Yes, hope India vaccinate many people possible. personally don‚Äôt see competition. size India‚Äôs population it‚Äôs matter time vaccinating people US (just purely based 1.2 billion people vs 330 million people). competing. want India great things want America also great things!

For first time, researchers found evidence novel coronavirus undergoing mutation infected newborn. According study, researchers observed genetic change five days birth.

Dr Mehreen Zaigham reports 27-year-old pregnant woman presented Sk√•ne University Hospital, Malmo, Sweden, severe abdominal pain. Along history fever, dry cough, reduced fetal movements. Doctors immediately performed cardiotocograph (CTG) test showed low fetal heart rate. Therefore, doctors rushed emergency caesarean section. woman 34th week pregnancy time.

Upon birth, newborn required resuscitation oxygen supplementation. hospital staff kept newborn isolation. first 60 hours life, newborn contact mother family member. per national guidelines, hospital staff also collected nasopharyngeal swabs mother upon admission 48 hours delivery neonate. came back positive.

Since baby isolated mother directly caesarean come contact family members tests done, findings confirmed baby indeed infected born.

**A Genetic Shift**

The newborn study developed symptoms tested positive antibodies soon after. Since mother‚Äôs breast milk lacked antibodies, researchers believe newborn‚Äôs immune system neutralized virus itself.

Researchers performed whole-genome sequencing confirm infection acquired in-utero. Swabs mother fetus along samples placenta underwent genetic sequencing. Results showed viral genome mother newborn identical. However, genetic sequencing done neonatal sample collected days later, showed change genetic sequence virus. mutation occurred five days delivery. Researchers believe change environment mother‚Äôs womb may stimulated genetic change.

The study also reported changes placenta. included widespread damage due inflammation maternal fetal side. Consequently, researchers believe even mild infection pregnant women lead placental dysfunction; thus, resulting low oxygen fetus. However, transplacental coronavirus transmissions lead severe consequences newborns.

The case study published British Journal Obstetrics Gynaecology.

Yes What‚Äôs wild number people vaccinated every day stay constant (and shouldn‚Äôt - increase), pace, would take India two years vaccinate everyone....and that‚Äôs assuming vaccine single-dose vaccine unlike Pzifer Moderna vaccines Americans used to. requires two doses - yep, they‚Äôd vaccinating early 2025.

None minimize accomplishment - goes show enormous India‚Äôs population is.

Thanks heads up. going see qualify. Ridiculous go lengths GA awful comes vaccine. feel like whole country vaccinated still qualify even though high risk. Wait, drive outside find vaccine? Haha, yeah, healthy bodies without masks creepy prize. get here?

They know vaccines less effective preventing infection (like JJ, you‚Äôre left great chance ‚Äúmild covid‚Äù) less effective variants (as know Pfizer Moderna less effective too). means vaccinated people going get covid potentially spread it, especially don‚Äôt feel really crappy. 

But said, shouldn‚Äôt split people ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù ‚Äúhigh risk.‚Äù lot people sick don‚Äôt even know. Diabetes, hypertension, obese, etc.

They want vaccines look like they‚Äôre getting vaccinated worth it, know people still going get covid nothing 100%. make feel better exposing ‚Äúat risk‚Äù people. 

So public message actually comes something like... ‚ÄúWe told healthy people unmask around you, step claim prize vaccinated! Healthy bodies full display, mask!‚Äù

Insanely weird. gross. don‚Äôt want healthy body prize... ü§¢

Just tell vaccinated wear damn mask inside around *everyone* everyone wants vaccine get one. people don‚Äôt want one concern.

Vaccination mean completely safe, understand that, right? Even vaccinated, still catch covid - do, may get very, sick, probably die. harder catch covid, impossible.

So means health depends, part, whether everyone else country also gets vaccinated too. would actually 'safe'.

Those inconsiderate, selfish morons still hurt you, even get vaccinated, point.

This firmly believe vaccination mandatory, prison terms fail comply. Wow guess plan worked  emphasizes it‚Äôs important get many people vaccinated possible and, people refuse, consider segregating unvaccinated, least high-risk populations, can‚Äôt spread reinfect vaccinated people, even it‚Äôs lower rate. 38 hours removed J&amp;J shot first night rough shape, you? fam got Pfizer sore arms flu like symptoms, whereas got horrible flu like symptoms zero arm pain. there's studies yet peer-reviewed published, data says reduces transmissions significantly already this. entire time.

Some folks need get fact there's going back way things back 2019. cat outta bag there's putting back in.

Now, better focus move forward year beyond. vaccines key making Covid-19 another nuisance seasonal illness vs one caused 9/11 every single day while. two keys effective treatment options get sick vs twelve months ago treatment long haulers (still work progress, unfortunately). UK allow export vaccines, UK also purchased first run vaccines factories set AZ plan exporting anything factories run complete.

Yikes goalposts kept getting moved follow Science‚Ñ¢. 2-3 weeks flatten curve. Oh..well actually need keep locking isolating, wear mask everywhere, even car vaccine found. yeah..we vaccine, need wait 85% people taken looking relaxing things. Actually, let's wear double-masks. Ok well vaccine now, could still potentially spread even vaccinated wear mask.

Even beginning worried long-term impact people's lives livelihoods restrictions lockdowns COVID could ever do. song dance while. I'm vaccinated. I'm done giving fuck wearing mask whatever else I'm 'supposed' do. COVID real threat life, bigger problems going health COVID. lockdowns swear God, S.

Thank you! heard maybe 3-6 months post gives hope last longer!! worst far. prefer anti maskers think COVID hoax. Ha! Thanks making smile. evidence can... Really? How? Unless you‚Äôve lived it, really room talk. one cares anyone effects directly. human condition. I'm sure experts know. point source produced December claiming likely mutations sufficient achieve immune escape would expensive unlikely. know claim kicking around epidemiology twitter spike protein 20 epitopes would make immune escape unlikely (I recall name researcher posting getting picked repeated lot).

But variants happened quite mutations spike epitopes increase binding ACE2 rather come cost fitness. papers tend waffle lot.

Offhand might interested paper 229E might might better analog also certain matters due cross reactivity even absence sterilizing think anyone really knows cost fitness immune escape fast it'll really happen, I'm sure that's right question.

Also preprint cross reactive T-cell doubt variants ever achieve immune escape T-cells reset pandemic back zero (which happen 1918 H1N1 either, came back seasonal influenza, immune cross reactivity pre-1957 strains 2009 H1N1 outbreak).

So honestly think it'll big deal either way. would see lot low populous states moving way already, ND's mask mandate ended 3 weeks ago lot local ones expiring well. also add 20% state's population received least one dose lot places tier 1C we're month month half away tier 2 general public. asked 100 people, morally right, destroy mental health teenage years 100,000,000 people, order save, say, 100,000 elderly, would get resounding, passionate yeas equally passionate nays.

Step away Facebook that's remotely true. Everyone suffers people ignore reality. vaccinespotter dot org I'm favorable vaccine safe effective. Practically, would ever FDA approve vaccine tested also US population? you‚Äôre genuinely asking, looking throw zingers one liners people (like, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt failed coup attend to‚Äù), reasons (I think) such:

1. COVID deaths severity *very* strongly correlated age, quite states single digit deaths 20 30 age group, almost probably immune compromised people. many young college educated people realize risk low. difference lies people feel responsible trying spread virus at-risk populations, others far individualistic feel high risk, allowed live life however want. ‚ÄúCOVID truthers‚Äù mean view restrictions overbearing inappropriate, it‚Äôs generally different viewpoint life.

2. Even support moral idea protect elderly, many legal punishments used enforce idea.

3. regards vaccine, I‚Äôve seen two major things make people ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù - one political pressure, White House threatening head FDA fired unless gave mRNA vaccines EUA, literally got EUA next day. look want. course, time believed getting EUA next day anyways, good optics made people feel political pressure caused thing approved otherwise may been. second big thing perception science rushed. Phase 3 trials normally longer time, lot fact incidence rate virus high (so easy show efficacy), lot people noticed messaging went ‚Äúit takes many years develop vaccines, it‚Äôs pipe dream‚Äù Trump‚Äôs early 2020 days ‚Äúthis safe, take it‚Äù fall.

Just 2 cents, talking people listening intently. hear people. last Wednesday. data showing second dose works properly booster 4 months effectively become second first dose 

Please stop peddling anti-scientific crap. There's thing ""second first dose"". 

That's vaccines immune system say scientific reasons longer interval initial second dose ‚Äî typically referred ‚Äúprime‚Äù ‚Äúboost‚Äù ‚Äî acceptable may Iwasaki, immunologist Yale University, said first shot, body produces ‚Äúeffector‚Äù cells, fight perceive infection, ‚Äúmemory‚Äù cells, retain information infectious agent enable long-term protection. ‚ÄúIf give second dose soon, mostly targeting effector cells memory cells,‚Äù Dr. Iwasaki intervals vaccine manufacturers settled relatively short compared vaccines. Gary Kobinger, specializes vaccine development Laval University, said urgency produce vaccine COVID-19 would led companies compress intervals doses much possible shorten duration clinical lot due social distancing, people need remember could still hang person covid get it. vaccine lowering already low odds super duper low. that's pandemic end. I‚Äôm arguing mother anymore damn shot, doesn‚Äôt want don‚Äôt give shit anymore. got mine can‚Äôt wait second dose. Sick tired stupid Trump crap. No, *short-term* gains, long-term worse consequences *and* people's health. Er, no?

Imagine missing fun parts school young adulthood thrust right phase life work becoming Real Adult. God, sounds miserable. 

So, comment sounds like ‚Äúpull bootstraps‚Äù me. Please consider valid pain mourning missed experiences young adults going time. Italy start lockdown (and hard one) 1 year ago.

think way, close reaching immunity via vaccine, may well take chances next 2 weeks antibodies sufficient levels 2nd shot. I'd say worth get across finishing line. Texas, idiot governor probably try prevent businesses requiring masks, least prevent County District Attorneys filing charges violate store masking rules. Hell, bet even idiotic attorney general already drafting anti-masking lawsuits. This... leap go imagined future la Gattaca frankly terrifying. Whatever works Ha, yea, figured would get hate here.

Maybe added took flu vaccine back October. believe reasonable trust drug procedure FDA approved, that's think twice offered flu shot.

I object hard question. FDA knows exactly process vaccine must follow gain approval. must several hundred experts know exactly vaccines process. asking anyone knows information available.

I personally deal government regulation different industry regulated regulator know approval processes required law. Reference CFRs online. think would informative expert summarize remaining steps approval process. answering question. Exactly. Let everyone wants one get one. see huge spike model seen says UK averaging less 100 cases day less 1 death day July. sure surge happen people vaccinated double digit daily infections. me? exact thing [From early cases tests broken residents non-residents. Deaths not. Florida residents included.

[Another someone dies Florida COVID-19 primary residence somewhere else -- like snowbirds visitors, example -- state Florida include death COVID-19 death count.

But also, medical examiners count every death occurs FL. sure state's reporting medical examiner shows lot tracking sites. UK strain plus unvaccinated youth/adults social distancing (and avoided infection whole time) dropped bit fast elderly immunised.

Cases elderly plummeting. They‚Äôre increasing younger groups. doubt urban areas, even 4 time slots would filled. I'll go sit outside vax site ass-crack dawn meant could get shot. understand priority system point fuck lets get shit arms now.

Every time try I‚Äôm told even wasted ones still limits nonessentials high risk medical conditions. Considering medical workers, teachers, essential workers already getting it, NY lowered 60, don‚Äôt think metric people follow. 39 yo brother Texas got one simply showing up. rolled vaccine provider asked concerns. Told channeling inner college chick ""Just put me""...she amused. Also interestingly doesn‚Äôt seem like nonresidents really meaningful source cases FL mean they're poorly poorly-run states. Gotcha.

If remember early January, millions doses held back administration due combination overly strict requirements underdeveloped infrastructure. States opened eligibility opened vaccine sites, we‚Äôve gotten 1-2 million doses per day. 

Now supply least 3-4 million doses per day, assume catch-up process needs begin. expect hear tons outrage next couple weeks, followed big increase numbers end March.

I‚Äôve past knew would fine, told getting Pfizer. messaging around awful. Instead headlining points would actually encourage people take shot they‚Äôre offered (total reduction serious illness / death, fact trials done differently numbers can‚Äôt compared, etc.), articles lead reiterating difference efficacy numbers. say seniors get effective shot they‚Äôre biggest risk serious illness, leads individual wonder - personal risks?

Many people flying Gatwick got intercepted denied. Heathrow checks try Vaccine finder dot org. 

That tell pharmacies area. got Pfizer today Orlando fema site. take whatever that's gave me. I'm pretty happy it. afraid needles got moderna. literally easier prick I‚Äôve ever gotten‚Äîbarely felt it.

Edit: yeah, yeah, that‚Äôs said. wife never bad flu, never got flu vaccine. little year ago, got flu, got secondary infection, died. Early 30s, perfectly healthy this. she‚Äôd gotten shot, she‚Äôd probably still alive (I got flu shot didn‚Äôt get sick despite taking precautions exposure sick, sleeping bed, etc).

Yeah that‚Äôs statistical outlier, takes know someone who‚Äôs outlier that‚Äôs it. Given cheap safe flu shot is, there‚Äôs really reason get even you‚Äôre healthy. Even doesn‚Äôt save life, it‚Äôll save feeling miserable take time work sit home suffer. guys helped us fight independence ... guess whole apple falling far tree thing. :) think downvoted question lot nuance easy answer. short answer - lot. phase three trials last 1 - 4 years (I know J&amp;J trial 2 years it). checklist lay person might know big providers process completing. (people refusing get tested, etc)

There also people cannot get tested variety reasons.

My doctor fairly certain COVID 2 months ago, told get tested. symptoms matched, nearly exactly, mild. mild, mean agonizing clearly point put hospital.

I could get tested without putting people risk. cannot drive, due old spinal injury. So, rather risk getting someone else sick (family, friends, Uber driver), doc figured would safer assume virus also assume 'not' maintain vigilance get vaccinated. Stupid af thats Could someone copy-paste article here? behind paywall. Traveling England Wales traveling world. Try mate.

Maybe educate speaking.  comes strict lockdowns agree. comes vaccine passports, problem those. Vaccine passports already thing certain countries like malaria common. I‚Äôm state least reporting least 3 days behind. (If got shot Saturday it‚Äôs possible it‚Äôs reported yet) also today get large shipment Friday used up. numbers spike midweek weekend amount available goes away. 

This doesn‚Äôt account every week greater percent shipment goes second shots. 2 shot system horrid. sit around 90% 1st shots used 70% second shots. It‚Äôs still supply issue. Formal FDA approval takes long. Emergency Use separate process FDA believes necessity product would normally take years formally approve outweighed desperately public needs it. best opinion believe safe effective. It‚Äôs like 99% odds situation. Normally ideally would like 100% right odds favorable need take them. best data decision-making might well slightly older data passed quality control, especially big events changing trajectory last days.

Are ever going answer question driving kid car? I'm serious. I've asked several times really heart feelings. judge parents country strapping kids cars go school, value school (or grandma, playdates) worth tiny risk.

I'll tell liberal talking points (my actual political orientation): crisis causing [largest gap haves have-nots ever before, largest increase gap racial gender divides past 50 years (same cite), largest increase eduction gap whites minorities decades.

Hopefully isnt problem moving forward Delayed reporting several months death certificates Total doses isnt great way look things going. 2nd shot limited got first shot 3-4 weeks ago, many new shots doing.

We going start hitting days first dose rate went due weather - means 2nd dose total going drop. I‚Äôve also read mRNA thought better auto immune issues.

I'm surprised J&amp;J numbers low point, expecting huge dump numbers we've cleared 300K administered full week. mean, 70% efficacy symptoms 100% hospitalization death enough someone, that's kind crossing germaphobia territory. stopped vaccinations today,

We aren't, discussing that?

You're also speaking entirely case counts. case counts decoupling hospitalizations deaths. numbers really matter may continue decline despite rises cases. true, slots available Sinovac booked immediately. since deaths health issues people hesitant.

I agree though people trust government all. entirely true. People immunosuppressive drugs need careful one take (Pfizer bad, astrazeneca good, consult doctor). probability? I'd love see real numbers. Forgive trust assessment.

Everything personal risk assessment, patronize me. Safety. using harmless virus dressed look like SARS2 test immune system responds without risking anyone getting infected it. There's J&amp;J! 10% delivered administered according CDC... hope see go up. happened rights private business? understand what's happening here. severe situation christmas less ths half amount patients ICUs compared last spring suddenly new restrictions introduced us incredible speed even observed kind effects previous ones have.

A set new restrictions came one week ago, yesterday new restrictions there's constant threat curfew, even told kind situation used. prime ministers answer curfew ""necessary, proportionate effective"" specific infection rate number announced. seems start curfew whenever want to, know. 

And amount infections hospitalized patients seems already started stabilize one week ago, way new restrictions effect. almost seems want add every possible restriction NOW, maybe would start natural decline caused spring, vaccine rollout etc. Got second dose Pfizer 2/27. worker test positive today decided smart come work without getting results yet.

He works room me, fifteen feet away. us wearing masks day. quite 2 weeks (4 days shy) second dose, likely could caught him? I'll quarantining regardless respect others. plus natural virus season us coming close. Warm weather always drives down, unless live somewhere gets hot spend time a/c anyway Buffer overflow attack reference I‚Äôm guessing?  No, mild sore throat first infection would passed allergies wasnt aware positive result. symptoms right now. Chris Murray, director University Washington's Institute Health Metrics Evaluation (IHME) said team's projections show ""things slowly steadily get better.""
""But worst scenario, people stop wearing masks faster, start gatherings faster, see surge April,"" said.

This certainly could true, inconsistent anything presently know. Nonetheless, think important note quote referring model includes explicit multiplier things. statement basically ""a model includes multiplier gathering produces result says gatherings would cause surge"". tautology, worthless non-information, model says built way. 

The utility model estimating magnitudes outcomes based best estimates variables, can't use input variables evidence themselves. defectors (anti-maskers) voting obvious truths?? Yea fuck guys. I‚Äôm defending one bit rebounds colder months, likely since virus appears seasonal, goal enough people vaccinated subsequent wave require restrictions.

I mean, also can't count storage freezers ""100%"" either. think worth worrying production capacity scaling meet global demands awhile. think companies well aware may need small number.

What's gonna us? 10M vaccines? what?  Great progress! problem can't get one.  Ultimately, believe expect able deliver countries. Oxford/AZ applied EU half January, already approved UK. Pfizer/BioNTech apply everywhere around time recall correctly. Labeling precautions taken causation.

And know what, -- yes. bloody well shut cases, knew full dealing SARS-like virus. know knew know thats information actively trying supress.

And can't imagine choosing bring states question here, nobody discussion ever claimed US anything even remotely close ""Gold Standard Lockdown"", comparisons actions frankly irrelevant. Same. People basically left spring break never returned. graduation. year without seeing friends. rough. Curious kind thing work kids, can't yet get vaccinated. actually think 2nd option morally better since least giving others shot unused dose rather literally taking brother's spot line. What's likelihood vaccines prevent long Covid? someone 20s, major worry. can't find research articles this, limited conclusions make based know? 80% people 16+ received one dose.

For 80% fully vaccinated (officially: one week past 2nd dose) would take another four weeks.

To 80% fully protected (two weeks past 2nd dose) five weeks now. italy lockdowned past year?

 hahahahahahaha. joke. Let's see long takes hit least 4 million day, we'll better position declare ahead next wave not. 

Fauci said early loosen restrictions. think said this...because we're woods already? Australia already got 300000 doses vaccine according predictions last produced locally Cancel it. morally questionable, illegal it. turn away wasted appointment Or, possibly morally questionable, cancel appointment call hours later asking unused doses missed appointments day...

Just call anyway ask extra doses without playing games. People miss appointments time. Either possible isn't. engineer scenario make happen. Pfizer Moderna also making massive profits back vaccines, afford throw money situation goes away. AZ forced sell at-cost, part deal Oxford, means they're reliant initial investments arrangements set governments, EU pretty slow lumbering arranging. That's there's many problems EU particular. Nah, make world news White guy saves poor brown Indian. Send mission Mars? Focus poverty. Make vaccine? Might safe Oxford one. COVID deaths decreasing? Mysterious. Maybe false reporting.

I live PEI, east coast Canada. thick? virus wasnt widespread... wasnt even pandemic yet... According ‚ÄòOur world data‚Äô website Canada administered 2.39 million doses yesterday It‚Äôs worth asking.

Bit moral question here. brother able get vaccine appointment he's high risk. scheduled later week. today found local federal site able vaccinate people criteria, able go get shot.

Now here's quandary: thinking cancelling appointment, wonder go time explain able get vaccinated live household ask they'd give instead.

Or, possibly morally questionable, cancel appointment call hours later asking unused doses missed appointments day...


Or cancel it. Thoughts?  Put fires rainforest, headlines chill bit temp lowers. research conducted lung scaring compared symptomatic patients asymptomatic patients chest scans found scaring common both.

We‚Äôve rolled military guard, kinda tapped spare vaccinators. poster make comment different thread. gave county (southern ohio) within 35 seconds able find appt nearby Kroger.

A pro tips: Seems like Greater Cleveland area like based hospitals mention. know parents senior friends Clinic UH useless regards getting vaccine.

* Make accounts Giant Eagle
* Check CVS every morning 5am-7am repeatedly. see plenty availability every morning
* Check midnight day
* Walgreens &amp; Giant Eagle know post new appts.
* Use too: Rite-aid Walgreens. give idea zipcodes put various sites. afraid check zipcodes bit further.
* Walgreens, try youngstown location. often tons appts there.
* really motivated, check CVS location in. Lima, OH. long haul, ALWAYS availability. time second shot, able get closer home.
* Also, aware FEMA setting site downtown Cleveland area shortly well. Well soon! Also, WAY easier produce, distribute, store, helps rural communities third-world countries way pfizer moderna. What? Great news. Hopefully leads peace region. Nobody cares many kids die long adults pretend things back normal.

To quote user here. 

""Welcome real fucking life."" funny confronted one complaining ""rushing"" openings sub got muted lol. think anyone disagrees hence see there... Finite manpower. take anything get hands on. 

But also Crunchy McAntivaxxer wants wait J&amp;J shot available, Pfizer shot declined still going get someone else's arm, no? That's interesting. wonder difference teachers older ages played factor that. agree long teachers vaccinated. one, know get one Mexico. Government rollout terrible. Right people 60 sign wait call get queue, hopefully get appointment.

I rolled father 2 months ago heard call since.

My hope vaccines created distributed countries, private hospitals pharmacys start selling point.  already 25% vaccinated.

We know long immunity lasts vaccines it.

""What we're saying right good least three months, probably longer, might lifelong""

[COVID vaccine immunity last forever, need late April almost certainly herd immunity risk kids point worse risk getting disease pandemic. 15% Disneyland indoor dining limited ndoor rides, everyone masked outside time... it‚Äôs really worth place shut down. exactly? actually makes sense Florida middle pack comes cases deaths. sunny warm weather year round, lots people spend time outdoors, despite large senior population, done good job keeping covid patients nursing homes vaccinating elderly. fudging numbers, would obvious. would actually easier inflate numbers rather hide them. Watching bears suck person? already certain diseases like Yellow Fever. Couch keyboard warriors never played competitive sport don‚Äôt see purpose. olympians solely entertainment value alone. Based read friends said expecting feel like death second dose. Somehow me, sister, parents like zero side effects slightly sore arm. Hopefully goes well you! mean, 7 day moving average best metric use, still publish articles daily death rate every day.  


People jump conclusions based report, still good sign! Honestly, large people life know it‚Äôs healthy acting accordingly covid age. 

Are really lot misinformed deluded people? think need mass vaccination sites. There's FEMA site near require appointments cranks thousands vaccinations day. believe vitamin plays role overall immunity immune function, bridge sell you. one main reasons cold flu season decrease sunny summer months increase cloudy cold winter months. want think lack manpower/vax sites. area vax sites always filled they're closed. need vax sites, see can't vaxxing like 4 12 grand scheme things efficacy doesn‚Äôt matter. Large countries get everyone vaccinated vaccine available drastically reduce spread covid Uh, that's 500,000 dead serious response aggressive shutdowns.

Also, probabilities spouted assuming person's concern continued existence. Not, know, traumatic (and absurdly expensive) hospital stay, long potentially permanent complication life health loved ones.

Also, there's \~5% chance person serious case Covid care 10 people, well, probably abide social distancing guidelines want live guilt maybe given disease them. Q, assumed recognize me... Yep. even see that. I'm pretend live Indiana still get vaccine sooner haha. rate, friends age health going get vaccine 2 3 months me. states actually authority restrict interstate travel commerce. reason would make sense international travel, vaccinated people quarantine. probably late start this. know, pot legalization, they're kicking ass. Especially snuck two cargo flights PPE start pandemic. Really proud city, state, neighbors. used impression think testing efficacy numbers exactly correlated vaccine testing pool. Different participant numbers different virus variant dominance different times locations testing make difficult comparison.   think reason allow vaccinated people escape quarantines traveling internationally. outside UK, largely driven kids back school. They're asked take 2 LFTs week. schools returned yesterday, performed huge number tests captured today's figures. Except Hawaii. fuck about.  J&amp;J numerous advantages, efficacy across different trials vaccines actually possible compare, doubly J&amp;J‚Äôs trial conducted spread different variants. Got tickets hawaii January! Glad took chance. Got GREAT deal! college Ohio (UToledo) seems set vaccination clinic ROTC last week. really quite cool see hundred cars tons people going thinking every one got shot. developed, tested, manufactured year. 

Science pretty cool. necessarily. hardly know whole story have, best, one side it. churches, again, even close whole story. Churches pay staff besides clergy pay PLENTY pocket support churches forgo much economic opportunity order work churches. Churches, non-profits rule, pay nearly well private even public sector jobs. Regardless whether think that's money time well spent, facts strongly contradict opinion. I‚Äôm expert, generally hear talk coming back terrible injuries sports world, it‚Äôs come back faster come back better average person would...

It true generally recover better general, that‚Äôs athlete peak condition better 100% do... Secondary attack rate workplace pretty low.  Well 5% average.  (So average infected would infect 5% close coworkers.) Workplaces really variable, you‚Äôre meat packing plant eating lunch together, risk infected first place low.

Say 5% chance catching first place * 10% (chance vaccine failure) = 0.5% 1 200 odds.  It‚Äôs probably even lower considering masked fairly distant.  chance severe illness someone working age would even lower still.

But thank quarantining anyway!  everyone showed respect others, there‚Äôd far fewer cases. understand, people positive covid test cannot prove may dealing long covid. health insurance implications Americans. 

It sounds like test help people get treatments covered. Plus states already know number vaccines delivered make reasonable assumptions many given out. dont think states looking CDC numbers, looking numbers. Disney willing\*

Disney could kept employees afloat wanted to. one biggest companies world market capitalization $366.52 billion. Even *with* COVID pay cut, Disney's top 2 executives still pulled $35 million 2020. right, won't. bunch dick bags bent destroying world. people get vaccinated, especially older Americans, vulnerability population falls. Biden administration reports 20% adults least one shot, including 56% 65. Measuring risk Covid longer primarily tallying daily cases analyzing positivity rate. vulnerable Americans increasingly protected vaccines, it‚Äôs also assessing number people developing severe Even pandemic retreats, won‚Äôt eliminate Covid infections, make sure major surges hospitalizations deaths don‚Äôt recur. One key indicator track whether stress healthcare system remains low. full year, officials trying ensure hospital use doesn‚Äôt reach crisis levels. Now, goal hospitalization rates resemble associated routine infectious diseases. Combined better control seasonal flu burdens hospitals winter, Covid transmission suppressed manageable Stepping vaccinations critical step. 2019 already filed. 2020 well trials end children get vaccinated too. Plus folks got Covid wait 90ish days get vaccine also. right, that's said ""some"" obese people. Also, tweet 55k likes. possible likes represent genuine agreement, think people liking tweet genuinely agreed girl. Accurate timely reporting definitely important, think over-estimating extent modifications restrictions snap decisions based days extremely recent data, rather phased time based stable medium term trends. state‚Äôs winter surge got start restrictions mostly lifted came control several weeks new restrictions imposed.

This called *post hoc ergo propter hoc*. California's winter wave cases peaked started falling near end December/beginning January, indeed several weeks new restrictions. that's *also* peaked Florida, Sweden, Canada, Japan, UK, many, many places. clear extent restrictions responsible bringing cases down. That's fair. Ted Cruz escape Cancun get away cold weather state reeling historic weather event dealing global pandemic, people able travel too.

Now I've addressed moved goalposts, question you. think impossible SARS-COV2 mutate something deadly? not? now. change coming months trials start demonstrate safety younger younger age groups.

Ineligible least end year they're expecting trial results younger age groups. That's what's frustrating me, talking vaccinating 1/3rd pop end makes sense kids ineligible prove vaccine safe them. research already underway.

Totally agreed, there's chance reaching herd immunity vaccinate group. problem online school. kids really struggle traditional classroom environments. 

However - teachers teaching in-person virtual time. think best way tackle would create virtual classrooms across district, one virtual teacher assigned per grade level. jealous Texas, 64 yesterday (and TX people IL, like 2.3x many, dozen). memory serves high 885 course preferable date numbers, reality none decisions made based vaccination numbers morning Saturday night. based deaths, hospitalizations, lesser extent raw cases. Vaccinations way us get numbers down. *those* going lag behind vaccinations extent really matter vaccination numbers one day old four days old.

That's opinion, anyway. going 2020 taxes? 2019? course covid's number go vaccinations

Bill Gates already achieved goal putting microchips bodies, next logical step reduce number paid actors running around

We've lost freedom, America. unknowingly gave people power track movements, someday come point they'll control daily lives

If think im crazy clearly blind real truth. cant blame though, government really great job hiding truth us

Do research, save kids, protect future. vaccines!

/s I've said elsewhere, events going happen, states need start announcing timelines things planned. PAX East less three months away, little time plan convention. I‚Äôm worried long term effects. pricked 10 minutes ago going back! seems bizarre me. 

My vaccination clinic themed vaccinations. successful lots happy people. 

I mean, end pretty sweet Candyland bandaid (my husband got Scooby Doo). 

I hard time believing necessary right many people desperate get vaccinated. luau would convince anyone get vaccine?



Edit - reading article, I've changed mind. seems like fun way celebrate moving closer safety. photos convinced me. Texas leading way post covid future. Still much fast, 4% population vaccinated far many places vaccine outages causing even delays.. mean friend mine deal family friends really hard anti vaxxers(the ones believe Bill Gates micro chipping us). He's got underlying health conditions he's high risk covid hr got vaccinated 2 weeks ago told friends(except me) family members since it'll bring whole argument think vaccines bad. also took parents secretly get vaccinated back January sister hard anti vaxxer totally vaccinated. took one day whilst work told sister parents got vaccinated still thinks haven't. 

Could always tell gets vaccinated avoid arguments. 30 got J J! nervous about? Eh, close enough. theoretical scenario everyone sheltered place, yeah, would outliers like that, infection already taken root particular grouping would needed truly quarantine longer. course, anyone who's around people longer 10min point life would known *never gonna happen*, even whole thing became entangled identity politics.

The original, mod-deleted post bit angry comment goal posts moved. long goes always contingent people taking individual actions limit transmission, always people follow recommendations, regardless personal reasons so.

Humans gonna human, do? get mad experts make timeline predictions turn wrong, species, really seem love unpredictable. Meh, next Wednesday even rolling 7 day average. I'm sure people Missouri care know numbers gonna panic.   5,766 today: Love place üí™üèªüí™üèªüí™üèª First edition holographic vial PA well. We've gotten 15 appointments people. ""6 days pure hell"" pretty normal influenza. Peak 3 days high fever. Nothing ""going waste"" Texas says, ‚Äúhold beer, we‚Äôll make America‚Äôs COVID great again.‚Äù 100% people stay home essentially impossible. Power needs created, doctors need care patients (both COVID non-COVID related), freezers food need maintained, crops need grown harvested, etc. people interact, go home families, spread virus.

Once start saying going phase groups 25% stay home aim 8 week span, talking grocery stores pharmacy workers needing open, shipping companies needing function, etc.

Then, work would undone single infected person comes internationally. provide perspective, even peak pandemic lock downs U.S., around 45k people every month trying cross US-Mexico border without going immigration controls.

People point New Zealand, ignore 1. island, controlling immigration much easier, 2. incredibly small population low density. slightly less population Phoenix metropolitan area, spread population density #166 199 population density world wide, around North Dakota. This... helping number elderly people pa. It‚Äôs rough. Here‚Äôs thing, impartial party (Canadian), US pretty front exporting anything, countries looked EU supply said ‚Äúyeah, it‚Äù. EU could‚Äôve taken me-first attitude front don‚Äôt think many would complain, they‚Äôre supposedly equity. Dont forget DeSantis striped counties power enforce mask mandates public way. fines anything. businesses better others enforcing - many avoided hostile customers. 

A mask mandates consequences (said publicly especially) real mask mandates. idea I've can't seem address point I'm finished you. many residents per capita live long term care facilities versus state. here, never see anyone without one, minus people behind glass barriers gas stations/convenience stores. walking around today outside like half hour forget still KN95 lol Alaska pretty well number wise well, obviously less people. 300 deaths total whole year many days 0 deaths. word lockdown appear thread now, first post chain 25% Americans willing face 0.012% chance death rather take experimental vaccine approved FDA, rather given emergency authorization following rushed development using novel vaccine protocol (mRNA).

You clearly vaccination - stop trying shift discussion. original post 25% Americans saying vaccine. 

The vaccine safe, hurt people prevents death suffering - agree disagree statement? live Downtown. video taken 2 weeks ago, spot edge Downtown/Midtown.

This outlier. every week, SEVERAL bars/clubs across Houston. dozens superspreader events occurring indoors every single Thursday, Friday, Saturday Sunday night (and Wednesdays too).

We even need get house parties pregames post games Heights, Galleria, River Oaks, EaDo Midtown.

Is quite level pre pandemic crowding? - think close (70% maybe) definitely activity January/February 2020. close enough normalcy basically GUARANTEE virus spreads widely? Absolutely. situation FAR cry Europe right (and parts USA, matter). government need mandate then? business closures, data show work?

For example, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, forms entertainment packed weekend Atlanta (like every weekend, even moreso NBA star game town), bars nightclubs California closed indefinitely, restaurants outdoor dining pandemic, Disney world reopened. It‚Äôs hour, so....... ridiculous expectation have. It‚Äôs Disney‚Äôs responsibility charity. ...it's actually still incredibly fast.

Canada averaging 100k doses day. posted getting vaccine someone said I‚Äôd turn lizard. new. not, maintain strict controls. Plus believe numbers China that's pretty funny. lots tourists took covid home souvenir, Key West several deaths tied trips here. numbers part Florida's cases deaths counts. Desantis dummy, saw tourists could come, spend money go home Florida's problem. Economically, Florida done pretty well that. Sunday. 5766 positive yesterday. numbers released day previous day. quite correct. minimum, provably correct.

The world Pfizer &amp; Moderna vaccines tested clinical trials different world J&amp;J vaccine tested in.

In mean time, number new variants rose greater proportions infection. likely resulted lowering J&amp;J numbers. suspected Moderna &amp; Pfizer retested circumstances, would corresponding reduction efficacy level.

As side note, hard part manufacturing Pfizer Moderna vaccines apparently process lipid nanoparticle bound mRNA. happens appears fairly secretive custom equipment manufacturers probably can't get relevant time-frame.  mean renowned internet douche bag Joe Rogan? actually trivia though. $30 voucher. Yup. it‚Äôs choice getting cold staying shut forever, isn‚Äôt choice. many people 65 + 2 comorbidities There's reason keep anything closed unvaccinated people remaining kids, die large enough numbers use care about. Thank conscientious like that! feel like whole pandemic response since beginning one giant example making perfect enemy good. know tell you. governor said they've paused phases, meaning standard. obviously 100% discretion.

And conflate masks vaccinations variant question. There's enough protection severe disease death Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, Novavax vaccines worry vaccine escape future variant. Im sure they're afraid ""microchips track locations"" phones laptops literally tracking us, even recognize voice face....and yet always hand/desk done good job keeping covid patients nursing homes vaccinating elderly.

Have they, though? 34% Florida's deaths long-term care facilities, compared 24% bordering Georgia warm California. Florida also pretty far list % population vaccinated.

I'm saying Florida's officials dishonest, making assumptions really backed data have. That's got well - vaccine type, lot number date first vaccine. know would reflect proof anything someone got first vaccine specific date. name information linking official proof second jab.

I think difficult implement given scattered records are. Israel able institute viable green passport system almost immediately national health system medical records housed kind national database would obviously include vaccination records. [There vaccines side effects immediate allergic reaction effect - effects shown within ~2 months trials covid vaccines occurred last year we've vaccinating people months now, nothing shown up. problems occurred past vaccines seem mostly instances weakened live virus managing actually infect people, vaccine causing effect typically caused infection vaccinated against. know, unfortunately wonderful sinuses allergies mean I‚Äôve breathed mouth years sleeping. hard work ruined Thank you! vaccine end getting? australia new zealand low population density, uk pretty high population density Ah, that‚Äôs understandable. I‚Äôm familiar lying/omitting information don‚Äôt want debate lol. never know though, could bring one day say ‚ÄúI got vaccine months ago I‚Äôm still standing‚Äù strongest survived. Mentally physically strong got first dose astrazeneca days ago :) still feeling weak, im glad opportunity!! Anyone else dealing people telling get vaccine? made appointment get vaccine immunocompromised bf family totally it. gets covid would far worse possible side effects vaccine hard explain covid deniers.  No. people know less pro vax. There's abit hesitant I'll still tell I'm vaccinated show safe. Although friend mine vaccinated already hiding relatives they're hard anti vaxxers like ones believe Bill Gates micro chipping us. wanna tell otherwise it'll bring whole argument understand he's telling Ah yes, must shithole state I‚Äôm in. big giant guns could kill virus would different think. That's.... impressive compared European states. BMI excellent measure. perfect works really well. real issue muscular guys fairly easily accounted ""fat"". 

A healthy BMI 25. that's almost everyone. 

For covid risk excellent indicator data easily obtained population, sampled cases, ultimately sampled deaths. True. sites reporting government already talks moderna, seems right. Yeah agree reporting odd. actual numbers, know mean. They're go 100% population way they're wording it, bizarre. normally see numbers like added up.


These 3 figures equal 100%, don't.

* vaccinated
* Received first dose
* Fully vaccinated

Apparently it's:

* vaccinated - 45%
* 1st shot - 13%
* Fully vaccinated - 42%

And could say 76% 55% 1 shot also gotten 2nd dose. phase 3 trial (demonstrating real world efficacy relatively short period time) enough EUA, phase 4 trial (much, much longer term measuring immunity efficacy years) needed full authorization. impossible vaccine given full approval terms. Question/thought herd immunity. one friend group gotten/wanted get vaccine (1/3 group is/wants vaccinated). general consensus I‚Äôve seen majority don‚Äôt need vaccine covid won‚Äôt worse flu‚Ä¶a mentality feel many still. question is, threshold experts think need herd immunity? also tell 1 ever COVID (that know of). Hoping decent discussion this, keep seeing articles vaccine take rate increasing amongst population even 75% adult population get vaccinated, get threshold? doubt Mexico. Lots coming countries south Mexico. THIS. Coming experience disease (also involving cells!) got fobbed told psycho THIRTY YEARS, irrefutable test result thing help. assume covid never came within 50 ft you. thinking I've seen epis Twitter etc schools reopening started it, consistent third wave starting October, holidays fed flames. Michigan went hard lock holidays, relented. might explain regional differences.  do, don‚Äôt, prove person essential worker, healthcare worker, teachers, etc prioritized. Tying vaccines even treatments self-righteous judgement major hallmark pandemic.

We vaccinate smokers. vaccinate overweight. vaccinate sex workers people work completely legal dispensaries whatever group need feel better than, matter impact actual human lives would be.

People really gross. got Mom appointment couple days ago, try places. sites don‚Äôt update quickly enough local heath department runs radio adds fat shaming promote health weight.

The entire thing messed medical perspective. aren‚Äôt thousands even though. can‚Äôt take mask live normally vaccine literally point getting it


3,662 new cases yesterday (8.3). businesses dropped mask requirements. Fully agree. teachers vaccinated see problem. Sure children still pass covid low risk teachers vaccinated non issue since they're protected illness anyway thoughts exactly. interest scheduling COVID-19 vaccination. We‚Äôre sorry, appointments available time.

I mean, maybe place, seems appointments might still challenging get. think framing slightly wrong.

No one's working full approval vaccines right now. wait end pandemic. point, experts ton data analysis happened come complete conclusion safety effectiveness.

Effectively, everyone gets vaccine participating stage 3 trial official approval, standard trial all, enough unvaccinated people left run on, enough disease wild test it. don‚Äôt need background medicine know overweight unhealthy. OP, background logistics. looks like (where I'm CA least) combination lack centralized scheduling system (although better one most, room improvement), poorly selected vaccination sites (we're using ballparks strip mall &amp; hospital parking lots- using racetracks, fairgrounds, small GA airports understand) lack staffing administer doses. 

I also bet there's centralized ERP system tracking everything unified nationally, administration sites probably playing telephone distribution nodes there's systemic way track throughput forecast volumes inbound/outbound streamline process.

Why using military deliver mass, come-one, come-all sites (at least 1 per metro area) reserve smaller venues at-risk beyond me. could system says- license plate ends 9, come today everyone car get vaccinated, maximum 4 people per car, first-come, first served.

Do big open area like fairground GA airport good feeder roads traffic control, alleviates pressure currently sites job. There, at-risk only, appointment, stock up, based reservations, first. daily excess sent mass site, enough throughput established, open mass site up.

Anyway, unsolicited thoughts, since said something. what‚Äôs damn point vaccine morons? Smh Amazing accomplish competent leadership. think systems set register, lot online, nationwide issue. sites start consistent openings, open vaccination more, addressed better outreach non tech savvy people. 

For example, parents 60s, fairly it. But, spoke vaccinated, said state tell go. 12 hours later, appointments following day. found joining state covid subreddit, waited till someone posted openings, boom, got it. TON slots available. go way try schedule know could own. So, think ton older generation waiting told get it. messaging poor unless looking information using different social media platforms get idea schedule. exactly nys advise taking another covid test testing postive three months. Second doses increase 1st dose increase. linearly increase number 1st shots increasing amount second shots need. unless supply 2 times number 1st shots given day point run supply issue. basic math. 

You track numbers VHD site show this. second dose become total percent distributed. number 1st shots increase much second shots percent wise. Northam TV explaining people weeks ago cause people got mad. lot grocery stores too. Think costs like $30. both? supposed ignore foreign adversary‚Äôs military agents trying prolong pandemic killed 500k wrecked economy? could send pic card tinder proof, like verify profile picture Yeah, beach 11 people week. really last sense anything normal. Old people go spring break think it'll bad would expect. really want know freedoms taken away life risky. youre comfortable risk getting coronavirus vaccinated vaccine 95% protective serious disease, idk tell you. may live risk free life home without meaningful human interaction, know people want resume lives. there‚Äôs life avoiding disease. great milestone. Keep going.

I‚Äôm curious live, also think proves listening science works. semantic correction unnecessary. sentence (So, far fewer 92 million Americans vaccinated) accurate written.

That's dude's point.

Now, sure, right fewer 92M Americans fully vaccinated. But, like, also true say fewer 101M Americans fully vaccinated. Neither sentence particularly useful, though.

Glad hear things working daughter well  headline suggests we're gunning fourth wave, true point time. speculative fearmongering.

If headline matched article, things would lot simpler. Dutch goverment fucking fetish lockdown. can't fucking stop assholes Maybe completely wrong, many media outlets took advantage public's fear generate clicks. Articles like ""healthy 18 year old athlete dies Corona"" although factually wrong, focus statistical outliers try exaggerate risk think point unvaccinated probably keep wearing mask. 

They won't. Cause cared others, they'd get vaccine. should. did, would create 2 tiers. One people wear masks, one do.

Haven‚Äôt seen anything something wrong way lot people interact information

You're absolutely right. One reason psychology behind attention-grabbing headlines they're used way addictive mobile games draw using emotional manipulation. 

As hospitalizations deaths dropping like rocks, vaccination records broken, pandemic-related news almost universally good, media running dozens headlines honesty subtlety drunken used car salesman.

The constant speculative ""WE'RE PROBABLY GOING WORSE SHAPE EVER SOON"" headlines problem. content articles not. 

In respect, certainly problem people interact media -- problem entirely people, headline-writers well. Riots voices unheard, told trustworthy soure. fucking ignorant selfish. can't wait weeks/months instead throwing teachers wolves? Great. long vaccine last? I‚Äôll fully vaccinated end March / good long booster provided? Thanks! mean point going holiday stay community. 

Plus shopping local shopping centre high street likely supporting massive chains / corporations anyway. 

Instead stopping ports likely supporting communities cash well. Generally speaking local tour agencies, gift shops, caf√©s restaurants rather multinational/national chains run places Brits/Americans go hometowns like Walmart McDonalds. example, Bermuda gets like $80 million year cruises alone. Yeah, that's what's happening. Water wet. vaccine cause cells immediately start creating millions spike proteins ejected detected immune system. large scale immune response begin. People never COVID don‚Äôt antibodies/B cells/T cells ever seen before, won‚Äôt immediate large scale assault. symptoms feel mostly driven interferons response.

Unfortunately, aren‚Äôt able jobs remotely teachers are. Teachers also incredibly robust union fight behalf. workers often not. 

It effective person teaching. That‚Äôs schools safely moving hybrid modes. always stick said. think teachers forced working person, that‚Äôs great! won‚Äôt don‚Äôt unions allow leeway work home. That‚Äôs reality. sounds like you‚Äôre completely rational it, even it‚Äôs tough move past anxiety. think encouraging people start dipping toes normal life right way go it.

Germany's minister health Jens Spahn said Germany receive 63 million doses Astrazeneca (16.9), Biontech (40.2) Moderna (6.4) Q2. Germany's share EU deliveries (18.6%) corresponds 340 million EU doses Q2 including J&amp;J, Novavax, Curevac.

So 300 million low estimate way look it. mean, endangering health health students, yeah, I'd sneer ya Alright let‚Äôs go far Germany's minister health Jens Spahn said Germany receive 63 million doses Astrazeneca (16.9), Biontech (40.2) Moderna (6.4) Q2. Germany's share EU deliveries (18.6%) corresponds 340 million EU doses Q2 including J&amp;J, Novavax, Curevac. 

So 300 million low estimate way look it. ""We found pollen, sometimes synergy humidity temperature, explained, average, 44% infection rate variability. Lockdown halved infection rates similar pollen concentrations. cannot completely avoid pollen exposure, suggest wide dissemination pollen‚àívirus coexposure information encourage high-risk individuals wear particle filter masks high springtime pollen concentrations."" really don‚Äôt think majority people went college made meaningful relationships time think kids self-actualize. love tiny humans, want care one. article said hospitalizations fell 16% past week Memorial Day weekend tourism season really kicks off, matter people masked not.  weirdest flex I‚Äôve read day. don‚Äôt understand point never said doesn‚Äôt want kids go back school. It‚Äôs okay little concerned long-term health risks kids without thinking risks high enough worth going back school over. year. vaccines literally landed January/February/March. 

Give vaccines time distributed. ""right reserved financial security"" also irresponsible someone barely support decide kids.

Those kids deserve good life scrounging pennies afford groceries every week, would definitely get good life without lot additional help. gold. Slightly confused. Suppose household household B fully vaccinated adults unvaccinated healthy children. According guidelines, two households meet indoors without masks? OK hang unvaccinated *low risk* people, going see unvaccinated high risk person, i.e. someone elderly, CDC still want mask/distance etc due slight possibility transmission. Took 2nd shot vaccine week ago. Glad hear works variants.

We really need kind hope here, since Coronavac almost we‚Äôve got (national mass production AstraZeneca shots initiating, though). Thanks speaking me. Strong media extremely important free fair society ""sunshine best disinfectant."" I'm anti-media all, anti-clickbait headlines. 20,000 children die year US, CDC statistics suggests maybe 300-400 died Covid. Whether right wrong, child deaths probably going treated big factor decision-making open up. Covid kills adults every six hours children entire pandemic. Except unanswered question. good idea. small nonzero chance. realize binary surety folks want actual situation.  makes sense, thanks clarifying! get really sensitive types things people's takes them. grew super poor super loved lot money know parents best always provided somehow - always clean fed. get sad hear people comment negatively poor people children - believe parents need provide basic needs necessities children - believe magic $$$ number hit able start family. 

And yes, damn shame people wait long days achieve financial goals stability!  small studies contraction/transmission far everything points significant lowering risks too. Pfizers vaccine 85% effective one dose. Although right people need two doses US funded multiple vaccines would (and have) became available administered one dose. Every vaccine available US funded US year plus Trump administration. fastest vaccines would take 6 months plus puts us deep last administration. funding distribution plan place long Biden took office. last administration still office would path today, outcome policy's lag months behind.





(85% effective ‚ÄúNew infections dropped eight weeks row, averaging 60,000 new cases per day week ended March 7. Deaths linked COVID-19 fell 18% last week 11,800, lowest since late November averaging 1,686 per day.‚Äù 

Well sure wouldn‚Äôt know listening CDC director daily briefings. Sheesh. So.....are understand million people province 90?  Even though unemployed entirety past year, like think got lucky able graduate right start pandemic. already struggling college, imagine full year strictly online. Sorry, never going happen. vaccine makers big pharmas rich countries too, notorious regard look public good Keep mind nr doses nr people vaccinated. also getting one shot provides partial protection, takes kick in. Also, people covid also vaccinated, cant add two together.
The state furthest along alaska, 25% ppl least one dose.

I guarantee case rates go bit, least states like texas gotten rid restrictions. However, important thing soon vulnerable people protected, hopefully wont big problem. get first dose Thursday! give information. got J&amp;J Saturday mass vaccination church site along (at least!) hundreds others even counted this. 


Had mild fever evening. Gone now. 


Looks like we're hitting 100 million doses 50 days rather 100. Time another stimulus check. 500 bucks everyone that‚Äôs vaxed. Same, time year Midwest reports local covid Reddit page workers confirming occurring Everyone asshole except you. don‚Äôt disagree half time doctor‚Äôs concerns calls tests put patients healthy anxiety risk worrying it. 

The root issue really people hypochondriac tendencies read anything. True! However condition applied SARS-CoV-1 known SARS 2002 outbreak, condition SARS-CoV-2 known COVID-19.

I check Wikipedia make sure wasn‚Äôt carelessly vague lol e close calls work lots people. may want rethink Masks 1.32% effective (reference CDC study)

You let fear ruin lives. source vaccine delivery numbers hand? Would like show family/friends anyone it. really grades matter. lost Grandma Saturday evening COVID complications. diagnosed beginning December. turned pneumonia, turned sepsis, lead numerous infections, bacterial fungal finally resulted one remaining kidney shut down.

However, see similar dramatic decline deaths, would lend credence idea. wife almost go ER 102 fever 4 hours.. everyone thing happen, side effects suddenly stopped Nothing change Texas. essentially already open locals 50/50 masks anyway. thing that‚Äôs changed government dropping mandates. Daily life won‚Äôt change much all.

If things get worse I‚Äôll eat words we‚Äôve seen enough times places like Florida know it‚Äôs end world. virus way data makes obvious /r/incest Lowkey funny Or, or, could mind business stop shaming people taking risk assessment hands, especially almost 1/4th country vaccinated? Saaaaame! request highest fives!! dewine. Right wrong, drew line sand. Moderna Pfizer? Yeah I‚Äôm going go limb say there‚Äôs actual evidence could shown that‚Äôd convince you. fortunately stopped around last summer. I'm still traumatized them. kool-aid? Sacrificing kids get back normal sacrifice I'm willing make. headlines always bit confusing. Korea giving Iran vaccines. vaccines paid COVAX, WHO-led global alliance purchase vaccines poorer middle-income countries. bought AstraZeneca. particular case AZ plant making located Korea. Hmmm...it arm holds true would awesome. I've heard people say got sick 2nd one. need live first able live lives. Half million able people like find people like exhausting. 

It's selfishness 101 don‚Äôt need vaccinate everyone Thanks letting us know something known last year pretty much. like getting pregnant using condom. still happen, still use condom keep odds low possible CDC recommendation travel fully vaccinated aren‚Äôt positive fully vaccinated people can‚Äôt carriers infect people without vaccines? Yes was, last immediate family getting shot, wife parents gotten well. common theme whatever side effects first it‚Äôll worse second shot Bold statement species have, what, 6-8 governments capability destroy species 10 times nuclear biological weapons... 307 255. kid went back 270 back track adult son wasn‚Äôt going get vaccine. company offered $100 got it, got it. I‚Äôm low risk person hasn‚Äôt wanted get covid *at all*, even mild covid. Long covid concerning me.

If question whether it‚Äôs possible get covid vaccinated person, think least CDC could clear fact much unanswered question instead playing word games (‚Äúhigh risk, low risk‚Äù) people‚Äôs health. 

The ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù ones trying protect health.

I‚Äôve talked many people today confused what, exactly, CDC seems saying low risk people. 

It feels lot like CDC thinks risking health vaccinated people relax safety rules. 

It feels pretty gross, truth told.  didn't. data lagged. remember buying forever ago, perhaps made free since. 

Wow, way arrive point! comment late thanks joining me. 

That‚Äôs said pedantic. quite literally math equation. unnecessarily added variables discussion didn‚Äôt use properly. That‚Äôs whole fucking point. Well... uhhh, even better then! focus systems built prey human psychological weakness ad revenue abused spread stuff? much abhor reddit culture starting comments combative statements immediately getting angry, appreciate comment idea personal responsibility.

I completely agree large part obesity problem due lack regulation around processed foods. However, think agree American culture least partly blame. People make choices, knowingly, Americans mostly apathetic consequences comes weight gain. completely apathetic, apathetic enough nothing it. Obesity problem spans socioeconomic classes well, socioeconomics explains it, certainly explain even most. Europe also obesity problem, I've yet meet European shocked portion sizes lack regular physical activity.

Regardless blame lies, pervasive notion BMI 30 ""pudgy"" healthy mindset, yet pervasive American culture. They'll lag bit. weird opening schools part Biden's initial plan seem like they're pushing hard ‚ÄúLife will
Change‚Äù - how? can‚Äôt folllw train thought. No, long mandates around don‚Äôt really choice time being, unfortunately. public ‚Äúsimple math‚Äù simple, wrong. Good try though. 

Hint: people need two doses don‚Äôt get symptoms second shot mean efficacy lower something? Nah venn diagram perfect. mother law extremely skeptical anything-big-pharma. type woman who, cold, make chew raw garlic gurgle concoction lemon juice, ginger, turmeric. saying there's way getting vaccine (I'm working it). also complicit regulation, always wears mask, definitely COVID. 

People complicated. easy thing say working grocery past year like many others have. nightmare.

furthermore, goal reduce spread virus much possible, grocery essential workers prioritized right healthcare workers, per cdc recommendations. state least, we've booted back line multiple times due assume political reasons, point fully expect happen again. Dafuq? US UK implemented export ban months see complaining it... You‚Äôve drunk kool aid. add ""if smoked get vaccine""? CDC imposed restrictions? No, didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlift restrictions‚Äù. 

They literally said exactly wrote ‚Äúexperts‚Äù say even you‚Äôre vaccinated still wear mask, avoid gatherings, socially distance. experts aren‚Äôt sure vaccinated person transmit virus still ‚Äúexperts‚Äù STILL guessing i‚Äôm senior HS too. Can‚Äôt stand online school. Never gonna happen unless every single person earth locks home simultaneously 2 weeks.   Eh, Facebook Reddit good do.

I'm super ready get back normal life.  vaccines probably reduce transmission somewhat well, ton good data yet. I've invited wedding June 19 need RSVP soon. I'm super familiar weddings I'm likely low totem pole guests.

It going large wedding, lots guests, somewhat skeptical careful guests are/will be. 27, T1 diabetic moderate risk, vaccine then. I'm sure sizable guests also it. also thinking taking trip Thailand early July visit long-distance girlfriend, might need negative COVID test take off.

Do think things returned normalcy safely attend wedding vaccinated? would likely I'd exposed potential test positive 1.5 weeks after? trying weight options here. Every measure hopefully gone states Memorial Day. I'm ready. people feel safe need wear masks even less likely show one wearing mask, least vaccinated. necessarily political, though first 100 days common benchmark policy review. case pandemic, also intersection post-Easter case/hospitalization bump cases lot time vaccinate.  Oh ok. reason asking plan go outdoor bar friend (who already Covid) Saturday 16 days second dose. I‚Äôm leaning towards going..

My oncology team really keen getting patients vaccinated clinic (which arm MD Anderson). know there‚Äôs definitely possibility vaccine less effective due chemo, proven studies yet much less effective, that‚Äôs case. far stance team vaccine better nothing. yeah I‚Äôll extra cautious case. 

Good luck brother‚Äôs health, hope treatment goes well! I‚Äôve never able this. Yeah possible monkeys brain.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* So, let's say, beginning pandemic Jan. 1, 2020. Cool? 

Waaaaay back thing starting get bad Mid-March, early April, watching every single news conference daily. 4 total. Country, province, city, health officials could sworn times heard looking 18 months 2 years this.

So, 18 months June 1. seems target lot places looking towards, that's great. projection come from? alerted 2019. shame countries failed act.  Italian officials lying, Italy EU given tens millions doses, going get 550k. They're trying cover arse blatant unrepentant theft. still 1600 deaths day. Remember big deal get 1000? Yeah. Let's feel proud this. too, considerate, especially older people wearing masks. worried covid transmission outdoors. 

I get feeling think lot privileged was. grew anxiety, depression, PTSD, OCD tendencies, suicidal thoughts. right go away, still these. people mentioned best times lives 30s.

And know anything post sounds privileged point obviousness. Pandemic aside, pretending none, percentage young adults think would part *cool college clubs* would even stuff like radar? small minority people dude. yet nobody wept everyone else's traumatic inability partake that, somehow everyone grows world turns good chunk people end agreeing party days best days life.

We need structure everything around making sure teenagerdom best time life. 

This stupid. Color surprised Turkish officials say vaccine got country higher efficacy reported Phase 3 trials elsewhere. 

I sure would love get best vaccine. think money it. spares. ""worked out"" people dying to. still averaging 1600 deaths day.

Don't even get started Florida stats. They're horseshit, always since beginning. Google really want know. Ironically mine always called Stupidity. seems spread long imaginary disease Mutations LESS lethality definitely possible too. said italian number doses high compared amount given Italy EU mean it‚Äôs literally google. It‚Äôs literate vaccines. It‚Äôs able type words largest website internet. Also wouldn‚Äôt mandated IV feeding listened closely initial vaccine rollout, vaccines designed prevent acute symptoms, disease itself. 2,632% increase cases year. Yikes. would choked it, wearing mask. Considering Wyoming doesn‚Äôt exist worried also last group get vaccinated state, sucks. good alternatives offer 

Last group too.

I volunteered Phase 3 clinical trial healthy enough so.

I got placebo I'm vaccinated. Alternatives exist. also says 3.0 percentage increase deaths days 81-100 people could eat Denny's. Totally understandable, data never bad thing. Glad family recovered! mean dude it‚Äôs literally google. Oklahoma moving Phase 3 4 tomorrow. open vaccine distribution 80% adults state. Phase two somewhat recently expanded include anyone 18+ commorbities well targetted economic sectors. Basically, OK resident want vaccine get it.

To date, OK vaccinated 21% population first shot 12% fully. fast. Brazilian variants start spreading here. yet another game changer. 

Brazil may remain closed world there's effective vaccine variant. Exactly thing is, I‚Äôm taking biggest issue. Obviously, actions health safety standards country make people sick cause widespread infectious deadly diseases. yes, house clean, thank much. 

Adding point, everyone else‚Äôs house clean calling disgusting practices Chinese wet markets. seen them? obviously anywhere close following proper food handling cleanliness guidelines. Chinese wet markets caused disease, biggest problem. countries produced many widespread problematic diseases, considered major problem (poor hygienic practices Chinese wet markets) resolved. making mistake trusting Chinese. seems can't convince otherwise. mutations spike sufficient make vaccines completely ineffective would also likely hinder ability attach cells using spike. Variants might make vaccines less effective, complete escape unlikely. Yeah wouldn‚Äôt even think it. people selfish. 

I‚Äôm personally going careful friends pandemic. disheartening know many people know don‚Äôt care life enough wear masks. many apparently feel need cull old.

I'm still totally convinced that's biggest reason got control though. (Geographic isolation, low population density, low case count time world realized problem, possible cross reactive strain region) Probably likely immune system function (e.g. immunocompromised, sick something else, etc) counterfactual speculation point 500k dead did.

Everyone else needs get back work stimulate economy economic stimulus checks. indoor public setting unvaccinated wearing mask, risk assessment need take account. We've literally always told main reason wear masks people around us.

That's people get upset see somebody wearing mask grocery store. they're worried person, because, due constant messaging saying such, they're perceived caring whether exposed anybody else. east Asia countries like Taiwan, it‚Äôs commonly accepted people wear mask enclosed mass transit space. Americans turned simple, considerate action something avoid really showcase worst American culture. probably right. vulgarity ""fucktrophies"" sarcasm ""brilliant"" sounded mad specifically. get man. peoples kids adopted.

Oh well. Look comments thread. subreddit full people mad couldn‚Äôt go favorite bars get drunk weekends. never cared anyone suffers. Anyone dies alone hospital this. certainly new perspective fellow Americans this.  mean ""immunity evasion isnt thing covid""? 

a) covid capacity evade immune systems

b) mutations sufficiently distinct covid therefore new thing

c) Evolution overdrive. people believe evolution ones die it. deny dying breath. First, rare side effect. Second, people get swollen lymph nodes time. minor side effect - I've swollen lymph node (not vaccine - happens randomly). weird went away quickly. Mawwiage. Mawwiage wat bwings us togeder today.

Biden change anything, playing pretty much exactly would Trump well, without stupid tweets.  one sacrificing kids. doubt tourism affected, look countries doing. Places like US going much difficult time recovering. mean J&amp;J single dose considered fully vaccinated? good. Wish good Downvotes?

Never thought would see life. Congrats hopefully easy transition second shot. got Johnson Johnson single shot far Texas mask mandate lifting, pure political posturing. means people cannot fined punished wearing mask.

I got vaccine thought ticket normalcy. everyone mother telling adhere fucking guidelines pre-vaccine. 

I wore mask everywhere, stopped going gym, treated patients throughout entire fucking pandemic, cancelled vacations get fully vaccinated supposed pretend I'm still vulnerable still transmit virus despite overwhelming evidence contrary?

Fuck this, I'm out. dude.. SWEAR would convenient! dream can't I? Wow. Judging 19 downvotes, sub-reddit zero sense humor. They‚Äôre mad want find excuse mad we‚Äôve live covid. case, excuse schooling called ‚Äúbest years‚Äù. reality one year hardly time all. vaccines wide spread soon. one gave f*ck people suffering isolation *before* pandemic. certainly won‚Äôt after. people want something complain can‚Äôt go get hammered every weekend miserable 30-somethings. That's exactly ignorance. Despite things ubiquitous, talking respect Chinese Covid. hypocritical. want clean world, fine, I'm board. things, make sure house order going others. unfortunate Covid started China went international. unknown could prevented. known many countries, especially US, allowed community spread international spread knew little nothing all. medical tests, always talk sensitivity specificity. imagine BMI medical test, sensitivity would near 100%. specificity would lower probably much. numbers pretty damn good general applications. misidentify ton people apply across entire population?

STILL beats hospital though! it‚Äôs race, vaccine win. vaccinated triple entire amount Americans total caught it, vaccinations occurred within last month. Hungary. honest, we've seeing shit like every week. week one bolsonaro's sons investigation laundering 6 million reais finantial records protected and, soon happened, bought 6 million reais mansion. worst, imo, behavioral changes contagious variants could cause small bump cases spring. 30-35% people already infected point, nearly 20% first vaccine shot (and rising), we're worst season respiratory disease, can't see bad 4th wave coming. mention, vaccines concentrated among vulnerable rise cases would unlikely produce big increase - - hospitalization death. He's recommended nationally.

And Federal facilities properties, he's mandated nationally.

Ultimately, likely advisors told (and probably correctly) there's authority national mask mandate. ideal number children western countries 2...not 1... Economic reasons largely more. 

There's reason Sweden, Denmark, Ireland Iceland 1.7-.19 fertility whereas Spain Italy 1.3. Poor leadership Could worse....you could stabbed Ok keep telling feel safer top medical experts agree somatic debilitating illness,a second pandemic will,and focusing researching treating it.Everybody sadly get that.Professional athletes,navy seals(mayo clinic rehab center) many otherwise fit healthy people.And experts say me.You entitled opinion medical matters. wrong, that's theoretical, anyone racist enough call ICE Mexican restaurant going kitchen asking who's Cuba make call.

If anything proving stupid racist Republicans are. assume 100% staff Mexican restaurant Mexico, can't even bothered use spare brain energy play race favorites spare ""good"" non-Mexicans summoning goon squad ruin bunch people's lives  Poor NY/NJ, first ones hit really badly seem last 2 coming down. Vaccines kicking holiday surge over. ousted idiot white house. helped allow qualified people actually able perform jobs. pertains health welfare. cool, bet whole exhibit fascinating. Something considered now: wonder eventual Trump presidential library going contain involving pandemic.  issue essentially ""control Senate"" is, case, technicality. Sinema far right democratic caucus gets. Manchin even democrat: he's independent aligning Democrats.

This one important thing: means Democratic party controls comes vote Senate (by way Democratic Senate Majority Leader).

But still challenge Democrats come 50 votes lot policies they'd like push least 2 barely-there democrats they're counting 50.

And may tempting say, ""Well kick out"", result would would Republican majority again, measurably worse. Lol that's hilarious privileged selfish fuck. world wide pandemic need work together america keeps everything themselfs, fucking selfish! even Israel giving Palestinians, think act US far largest donor covax. best time reopen schools 11 months ago. second best time right now.

Lol answered question still, nice vaccine safe, hurt people prevents death suffering - agree disagree statement? I'm saying risk children miniscule. Even enable spread, vulnerable population impact anti-vaxers. state finally 5% positive test rate, goal aiming since beginning pandemic. think teens vaccine roll out. women 1 kid western countries. 

It's choosing. someone lives Mexico spends lot time US, US doesn‚Äôt COVID Mexico lol. yeah case drops way sharp vaccines main cause. Seasonality, built immunity cautiousness probably larger cause. fact dropped started vaccinating serious numbers even reason celebration optimism outlook going forward. 

The spanish flu fading quickly point without even vaccines understand idea could possibly huge wave coming, make sense. I'm cautious smart really think fear mongering helps anyone. Nice selective quote. Here's said often past year good reason: 

No, good reason. People hear stories motorcycle crash victim declared COVID-19 death, feel COVID-19 may over-counted.

This blatantly false. opening paragraph pushing political agenda. Oh look, whole site pushing political agenda. Moving on. don‚Äôt think people reserving times, sign told appointment is. Then, sort risk always assign next appointments risk people signed up.

What someone risk signs you? system hold earlier appointment doesn‚Äôt even know exist yet?

Philadelphia closest thing you‚Äôre suggesting think of. city runs vaccine registry way get appointment contact invite (which order vulnerable, regardless signed up). let tell you, people *fucking hate it*. fully vaccinated stat pretty pointless effectiveness two shot vaccines incredibly high one shot. 68.6 million ""fully"" vaccinated gross undercount. likely closer 300 million people  looks like Novavax 52% effective B1.117 variant preventing cases. studies yet able prove effect severe cases deaths right ages present studies. That's latest news I'm aware of.

I also confidence ability turn boosters.

Further, think zero COVID goal. What's specific goal this? take care stop worrying vaccine get. would cause interesting situation. first couple batches, EU allow exports? getting vaccination. However, get it. anyone wants get it, get it. want get want forced upon me. mean, right. Joe ‚Äúbro science‚Äù Rogan exaggerates everything. brazilian, personal opinion bolsonaro uses pandemic smokescreen sons schemes, tries extend much can. people concerned covid, basically wants people can't anything they're fighting die.

As last year example leaked video ministerial meeting bolsonaro's environmental minister said use opportunity (COVID19) weaken eviromental laws people media focusing pandemic. increase risk infection. Mutant strains occurring world. could Olympics mutant strains. movement people countries need restricted future. Tourism, study abroad, immigration, refugees may need banned. world may back normal time. friends 30s early 40s vaccinated anyone want take bets date US reaches universal vaccine availability? would supply vastly outweighs demand. lol, we've wearing masks social distancing year. 

your degree worth paper printed on. Everything says disgusting miscalculation sake pessimistic. Even Fauci thinks he‚Äôs wrong show that. data much small demonstrate anything approaching said here. thing happening Florida. Big cities governor scared feel? prefer Pfizer?

Wishing best fingers crossed less bumpy 2021.  needs noted concerns based *similar* drugs EIDD-2801 mutagenic, drug itself: toxicology studies done since Bright's complaint (his worry studies completed yet) found anything untoward, see reason particular concern. think time start vaccinating everyone. 60% senior citizens started vaccination amount anti-vax sentiment US I'm sure many get vaccine immediately. people posting saying pandemic false along dying really never bad. shit people literally lost family members, got really bad even. Self-administered, back mouth nose, feel resistance. really bad, go far up, even nearly far seen. surprised Kansas better that, like claim (and data bad). government Topeka incredibly bad getting anything IT-related done, especially ""quick""timeline like this.

Uh, part US caribbean  That's raising bar stupidly high level. impossible get reservation older people technologically literate.

Big one here. sister set appointment grandmother, easy task. also close coordinate uber pickup dropoff well. 

With fast paced appointments go there's way grandmother, even found site, would able book herself. Tiered rollout means getting vaccine arms likely wind hospital die first. 80% deaths US people 65. Vaccinating first quickest way save lives. I'm like you, eligible group yet, I'm grateful be. It'll open soon enough. really sad narcissistic people be. dad currently bind personal life (lack employment, various health issues, various mental health issues), still took broken car health dept flu shot tdap booster could fly meet son Thanksgiving 2019. amazes me. least alright got one un-selfish parent two. people observing CDC guidelines pubic spaces, risking health safety innocent bystanders? agree! need change prioritization works. Maybe 8-12 time slots reserved elderly high risk people rest anyone.  cases falling getting people wear masks social distance. Removing restrictions propagate spread virus lead us worse long term problems. Then, social economic damage survived pointless. 

This opinion. non-medical opinion medical issue. spent better part last decade training, studying, practicing medicine. professional, medical-degree-backed opinion actually useful. time crayons explain wrong. whitty? says right CDC site: Data 6AM ET. takes usually around noon roll everything get posted. time posted listed day. report separately well don‚Äôt quote next sentence well. 

‚ÄúCOVID-19 equivalent bad flu. said often past year.‚Äù

Read whole paper pass judgement. Start 1st? LOL like end 3rd right now....we close end thing He's wrong lockdown much scientific community think variant reporting little irresponsible say least.

For no, state likely checking doordash qualifies vaccine. California ton farmland also many people live there. Folks definitely concentrated clusters - Sac, Bay, LA, various semi-cities Central Valley. Expect ""100% effective preventing hospitalization death"" responses. truth, sample sizes large enough make claim. wish stop anyone else pursuing vaccine option choice I'm glad vaccine available Johnson Johnson.

I think available people use we'll vaccinated. think sell - single shot vaccine pretty good selling point own. 8 page. again, people typically source widely known information. news outlets reporting this. Getting mine CVS tomorrow. volunteer assisted living home LA ( serve lunches, play games, direct visitors etc). forgot letter director.....hope don‚Äôt ask. long term studies them. 

Unlikely anything would happen, still..

J&amp;J doesnt risk. White House doesn‚Äôt work ‚Äúdeals‚Äù locally operated teacher unions districts. Nj meals wheels house J J vaccinations. old person homebound person check out. federal advice ""not yet"" -- worthless. states going throw towel unless clear, reasonable timetable there.

Honestly Fauci &amp; Biden realize damage ""you still wear masks/distance even vaccine! nothing really changes! maybe 9 months we'll fraction glipse slim chance normal!"" done thought thing. Worldometer great looking statistical trends surrounding daily cases deaths, think really bad active cases. 

Here Nevada 14 day average cases count 200‚Äôs yet say 40,000 active cases. Makes sense. Even took someone 30 days recover we‚Äôd 6000 active cases. Mmm like stories grandpa used tell. Thanks! So, Brazil really well cases continuing rise President caring people dying. could impact global scale virus left untamed? know mutants possibility, could render vaccines ineffective? mutate, could mutate less lethal? (I‚Äôm curious interested learn could occur left unchecked!) Im pretty sure didnt covid  problem AZ kept deliveries going also delivering here. big difference, shortages split exports local deliveries contract required.

Pfizer also exporting EU that's issue. Like I‚Äôm sure. ü•± happy don‚Äôt live Florida. feels like they‚Äôve vaccinating 65+ forever  Yeah, whole family symptoms weren‚Äôt bad, woke chills, lasted 30 minutes gone went back sleep. low grade fever (99.6), felt great. bad migraine though.

Which blows mind. anything, Trump needs come say ""this vaccine mine, victory! go get maggots!"" actually saying *you* anything illegal; rather, would illegal *them* give vaccine place brother, state mandating vaccinate people eligible. state may *some* exceptions avoid wasting doses, ""I decided come place brother scheduled appointment"" certainly one them. crazy- essentially receiving vaccine retail pharmacy really honor system (honor system booking appt online honor system getting actual vaccine pharmacy)? whole point thread make information accessible. replying you‚Äôre service help others.

The one thing would note it‚Äôs 10% *confirmed* cases, since severe cases far likely confirmed, CDC estimates undercounted 3-4x, it‚Äôs probably closer 2-3% overall, skewed towards older thought due Hurricane Michael 2018 destroying many homes. left many people living FEMA trailers could fix home.

Exactly bad want dine rather get delivery? 

And make sure understand exactly number means. overall number cases increased 1% due tiny amount people actually went restaurants, reduced capacity seating workers wearing masks, everyone washing hands, increased filtered ventilation, etc. 

The number huge.  really need compare number new cases (this 1%) number people ate restaurant.  risk infection dining much much much higher 1% more. smoked many years, started vaping, quit altogether. bet qualify...

My personal guess states switch vaccinating over-50 people largely away complicated occupation-based tiers now. Possibly focused efforts make sure groups still get covered. that, think we‚Äôll hit point start vaccinating general public beginning May. tell us average infection rate compared communities size.  ""beaten thing"" good phrase scientist's point view. dropping 1,000 ""street sign"" suggesting (indicating) right path.

.

But, states start abandoning protocols, ""beaten thing"" real approach herd immunity delayed. amount delay easy determine.  Total appeal emotion fallacy. There's 99.98% chance survival people 30s. 

Obviously every death tragic, lives livelihoods ruined continued restrictions. restrictions social economic activity done barely anything stop spread anyway. compare Florida open months restrictions, California stringent restrictions.  originally siding lockdowns, protect vulnerable, we're largely vaccinated elderly vulnerable cases plummeting survival rate younger people low, worth continued social economic damage. agree. ran math even 201 million adults could receive test, cost + cost postage included $1.00 each, that's 201 million dollars.

Something tells $201 million dollars could pay fleet people literally scavenge WAY 15,700 highest risk patients across country get vaccinated. wish school district wasn‚Äôt incompetent. started hybrid learning week ago. grades terrible whole year along mental health.

I'm one team 7 work gotten vaccine (im 24, pre-existing conditions, really healthy). 6 either older co-morbidity. Fingers crossed make open general population Absolutely anything said US official Trump administration suspect

Does include Fauci? It‚Äôs either two serious months lockdown whole year purgatory look appointments time family members Miami slots available anywhere day. like appointments unused. 

Last week ton appointments available Tuesday Wednesday CVS opened vaccinations nothing since. wife teacher got appointment 72 yr old mother law got well. really don‚Äôt know facilities open weekends open weekdays Vice versa lag reporting.

It worth opening additional categories slots available people. Try vaccine finder. area (Arizona), it‚Äôs mostly grocery stores most. simply don‚Äôt qualify yet, call doctors office pharmacy see waiting list people group yet. Yep, daughter came home earlier complaining hurts. warned would twice week on! schools require yet fully FDA licensed?

I'm lawyer public-policy expert, hunch ""no"". However August Moderna Pfizer formulas full production 9 months.

I figure one move heaven &amp; earth get fully licensed then. Especially rev childrens' clinical trials say early June. That's several 10s millions doses Uncle Sam gladly pay ... imagine Pf want leave money table. expectation get approved ridiculous theory I've heard vaccines change mRNA everyone susceptible biological warfare another targeted pandemic... That's understanding vaccines gaining FDA approval. would need see adequate time observation.

So that's Phase 4 Trial brought up, could take couple years?

Is anything else must done? Assuming trials children? Trials people certain conditions common population? Again, guessing here. Bloomberg lagging behind Canada‚Äôs number. currently 5.12% one dose says 3.5% metric. ""Janssen Pharmaceuticals¬†is a¬†pharmaceutical company¬†headquartered in¬†Beerse,¬†Belgium¬†and owned by¬†Johnson &amp; Johnson. founded 1953 by¬†Paul ideal number children changed. still around 2.3 per women, women achieving that. Child less ness also peaked western countries. happened didn‚Äôt Biden send request states expand eligibility? wonder see happen end week Agreed. realize places *are* giving doses rather letting expire? like that. like we're trying first get new iphone.

Many elderly can't travel far whim either. know mom drive miles, can't take far given day either. homeopathy complete fucking **garbage** even need waste time rebutting stupid bullshit. Yeah hard lost 120lbs get it. simple problem that's hard do. obese end much richer rate. stat makes American ass feel privileged, sympathetic guilty time. Oh you? elected *you* king!? vote you...  Oh I'm blocked üôÑ Looks like Although note early studies showed transmission less likely amongt kids. Nit sure that's still case not. Well elderly relative highly likely vaccinated pose much risk since they're protected. underestimate ability country turn blind eye every time India helps them. sounds like good idea, least surface. Would help resolve issue home schooled students whose parents may end slacking it, setting kid back. like opt enroll child remote classes instead. got first dose Pfizer yesterday. flu vaccine usually gives headaches, low fever, soreness, far really much way noticeable side effects. arm less sore recall flu shot I've barely noticeable headache. Presumably US-only? Europe well. arguments ridiculous. end, lost. know, right? 60 somethings ancient. insurance general practitioner, wrote ""n/a"" part form. shoot back tho States lifting mask mandate? Germany trying right now, sale every supermarket $5 per test.

Also, companies urged weekly employee tests.

I'd convinced would mandatory companies public institution, enforced civil liability tracing costs encouraged good fast quarantine compensation enforce it.

But start. doubt either. idk easy/hard set vax site, tons empty space it. Empty convention centers, school gyms, etc. issue adminstration simply enough nurses/people give shot. matters me.

But would agree pandemic appears slowing end year two. seems take several years vaccine get FDA approved. I'm pleased outcome I'm sure comparable scenario.

If choice scarce vaccine made available moment, takes planning different logistics. could cause deaths overall. companies lot less open licensing vaccine production. flu shot platforms created half century ago. They've ample observation time. possible create completely new vaccine give full approval year. I'm boat buddy, went last February calming people's nerves that, no, thing fatality rate 15% even 3% going multiple millions deaths US, trying convince people (mostly places) real serious almost certainly going see hundreds thousands deaths, trying calm people's nerves going go forever, end sight. Removing mask restricts wanting avoid another shutdown competing ideals pulling opposite directions. anything shown last year, it‚Äôs people personal responsibility accountability comes *other people‚Äôs* safety. need understanding virology realize every time virus spreads new host, risk mutating. mutates enough, potential become infectious deadly, could also allow current vaccines rendered **completely ineffective.** Let sink in. means go back starting line. pass go. collect $200. cracked case! huzzah! Ridiculous. lie, mean. So, go Disney lot, think seriously trained us this. Disney uses online bookings everything, learning tricks really translated success us. learn time pharmacies drop appointments websites unique tricks. And, yeah, rural areas target drive get vaccines. appointments wife, separate days locations, 100 miles away, parents, like 120 miles. Yes, issue reliability lag time infection detection instant test kits.

Only recently put together within level reliability FDA would approve.

They pretty high bar at-home diagnostics. took many years get self-read in-home HIV tests beyond in-office instant tests available medical practices. moments flows consciousness. professional, keep hoping way get people. time goes feel hope slip/sliding/away ...   Jeez. dopes hate teachers much? thanks giving thoughtful response instead downvoting. good question. see quite like references journals homeopathy. message seem getting categorically reject anything connected homeopathy scientific enough, could possibly spread misinformation.  view?  Unfortunately nothing done without ulterior motives. either something benefactors like one side doing, try politically correct like side doing. Either way wont move fast enough getting everyone vaccinated life return much normal possible. 

At worst expect spill end Q3 beyond everyone wants vaccinated get vaccinated. least they‚Äôre acknowledging end Los Angeles County probably drop red orange another three weeks things keep going are. reason county needs remain one level three weeks drop again, otherwise would even sooner. Kinda like Bible? COVID-19 equivalent bad flu.

Reported misinformation. Pfizer chief taken first dose already. idea people getting crazy ideas from. agree reservation system. adds layer complexity pharmacy working individuals' schedules well pharmacies schedule. clunky. 

Probably similar, reminds getting seat United, checking window, far back, overhead room. switching Southwest get line walk on.   mean first half nonsense speculation baseless inference vaccines, second half hawking miracle cure. Nothing value here. time FDA enough data time give full approval, pandemic time. really matter me. US missing international relations boat here, country share vaccine production. Affirmative asylum seekers pretty negligible effect COVID. represent minuscule portion traffic US-Mexico border compared commercial activity though, least entries reported on, seemingly required [test negative COVID reference, add entirety affirmative asylum seekers Latin America course full *year* (including countries like Venezuela they're unlikely come US-Mexico border), going tens thousands people, significantly less number new COVID cases detect literally one *day*. small fraction actually crossing border right now. allowing group people await hearings US side border instead Mexico side, take pick million different reasons, there's significant COVID risk here. even working weekends.

Short making part time job look vaccine appointments, darn near impossible moment.

With influx vaccines I'm hoping matter couple weeks though. People fully vaccinated worldwide:

**0.88%** (68.60 mil / 7.79 billion) Actually, true, suppose could debate support Trump blinded stupidity, ... , et cetera. Lol guess makes sense period time. hit cap revert point correct? Like 100 70 first 30 seconds 3 weeks could 70 seconds 150 would increase percentage, following 3 weeks would say 80 (remainder) second doses say 175 would either decrease stabilization depending total supply growth.

Ok yea, think might game plan. long approved vaccines, maintain national emergency. FDA approves one, end worry bureaucracy trying administer unapproved vaccine normal state.

Countries thrive tourism like Thailand thinking summer, seven day quarantine vaccinated tourists. places like Vietnam NZ? Definitely anytime soon. you‚Äôre cat?  comply businesses policy could mean criminal trespassing charge, Bexar County District Attorney says definitely happening NYS start vaccine access I‚Äôm pretty sure got handle thankfully. Decades voting austerity buying trickle down, still expecting amount benefits service, consequences. go hospital twice week dialysis family member, one country wears masks. all. Even scientists tainted beliefs, formulate hypotheses accordingly look data support that.

I find weird 90+ percent population vaxed, withdraw de mask mandate (or prevent infection variants strangers ?) That‚Äôs good, need scale bit considering population size. 
Even smaller population counties like UK aim least 1M. must driving crazy hear stories countries letting vaccines sit shelves residents turning one vaccine favour another.

Anyone 16 Israel wants vaccine one. vote someone psychopath. RNA sensors like TLR7 TLR8 react foreign mRNA trigger mass cytokine release. activate strong immune response causes symptoms.

The mRNA vaccines modified nucleosides supposed allow bypass RNA sensors, would reduce immune response. everybody different, genetics could result immune system still reacting mRNA. shocking bad EU handled pandemic. news update one states hospitals Paris cancelling %40 procedures free staff beds.

I'm done honestly, care enough wear mask around show love/attention all. Sorry - pandemic really brought light actually sort compassion family. ""Karen"" never ""meaning"" begin with. outlet middle high school aged Redditors complain moms. Kids losing childhoods. They're experiencing lives; they're still kids, they're still alive.

The reason we've lockdown long people like you, saying kind thing last year. 

Enough bullshit. I‚Äôm saying three get together masks risk studies done older individuals? parents might get vaccine week, they‚Äôre 64 69 afaik study done people 18-59, safe assume effective older people like every vaccine? Good time prune facebook entirely like. shithole states lifting mask mandates...it's calm storm imo. Well point, many confirmed cases multiple important significant effect herd immunity and/or re-infection odds. actual amount still 10x confirmed would 90% population. 

And its, say, 5x contagious 5x less deadly think total deaths same, information could change public health policy significantly. 

I dont think pointing logic math high true count implies automatically means downplaying deaths. suppose issue ton people don‚Äôt trust flu vaccine. really vaccine. 

As mom micropreemie, cannot tell stressful conversations surrounding telling family friends ‚Äúno cannot meet 1lb infant unless flu shot, TDAP booster, feeling well‚Äù. mom (and really moms family) still yet met 2. Covid vaccine added list. 

My son went daycare last august and, do, doctor recommended flu shot said yeah sure not, get too. Talked later neighbor similar aged child HORRIFIED gave flu shot son. like listen... I‚Äôm trying jerk here.... ever seen toddler flu? It‚Äôs something ever want see. would truly believe getting flu actually better shot? Obviously still know there‚Äôs chance get flu like, come on?? 

Anyway point is, lot on-the-fence vaxx people think truly know.

Oh well, family getting covid one able. Nothing else anyone else. take advice WSB. That's got Autism read guidance, says fully vaccinated people need test quarantine exposure. strongly strongly implies exposed fully vaccinated person spread disease. So, two fully vaccinated people together spread virus other.

Flying completely safe. well, that's diet. don‚Äôt vaccinated written me, masking also courtesy haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet. Sorry getting downvoted. understand would concerned. keep seeing reports new variants popping everywhere. certain point, need accept best protection situation going have, risk need acceptable. We've seen vaccines generally affective known variants, variant mutations seem convergent, say multiple variants showing mutations. would follow new variants likely show mutations. therefore, current vaccines likely affective new variants. Neither get credit. Pfizer Moderna get win. scientists, employees, executives. random person president time someone developed drug. Good (and sad) know. really freaked out, I‚Äôve never fainted like that. Still waiting call back doc discuss hopefully worst it. heard associated vaccine.

So people didn‚Äôt think joke funny thought was, don‚Äôt move on? scientific citation drop due holidays. general back claim ""the end holidays"" responsible. cites two sources saying indoor gatherings 5 people peaked October people responded dangerous conditions changed behavior, gathering LESS holiday season prior holidays. discusses growing levels immunity. discusses seasonality similar similar viruses. discusses holiday gatherings one component among many contributed rise fall, concludes predicted holiday ""surge upon surge"" never materialized. 14 day before. upset lifelong public health official delivering medical information conservative tone? would prefer, game show host suggesting inject bleach? bit, gotta say great think matter ""blowing off"" much unclear eligibility protocol system makes pain ass actually schedule vaccination. time comes vaccines available anyone shows up, going see lot people seventies eighties waited could walk get one since want bother confused online system annoying anyone helping them. better Phish song  harsh, majority died working. I‚Äôve noticed people desperate COVID end they‚Äôre celebrating prematurely. still 1000 people dying every day. COVID previously?

With Moderna Pfizer, you‚Äôve COVID previously, it‚Äôs opposite reaction. first shot go hell whereas second shot major side effects sore arm. Everyone paranoid flying probably way safer activities. Good you. Make sure mask least couple weeks second shot too. It‚Äôs virus work becoming tired. Error catastrophe suggests virus replicates, particularly rna viruses like sars-cov-2, mutations occur replication decrease genetic viability. accelerated certain threshold, mutated replicated viruses outnumber viable ones, causing virus burn either isn‚Äôt functional cannot replicate anymore.

So, theory medication speed viral replication rate cause mutations happen accelerated rate, once. mutant ‚Äúerrors‚Äù take over, end dying virus purged.

Nah CT opening vaccines anyone (over 18) May 2nd actual both. 25% already 25% vaccinated. That's 50% immune. 2 months nightmare turns bad dream. think I'd willing concede point. record number people moving away old mindset here.

You best wishes. Nobody would ever call Tamiflu ""needed medication"" case like this. crappy med questionable efficacy best circumstances vast majority cases, frequently causes problems solves. We're talking antibiotics strep throat here. tamiflu. 


I'm curious many times *you've* prescribed Tamiflu, telling doctors jobs?  race Usain Bolt vaccines, random dude virus. know money on. things happening since last summer stopped last big surge.

Also, I'd like know people tested? symptomatic? part routine screening, actually showed symptoms? WAY many questions article neglected ask. Well, people *do* lack self-control. get lot wrong U.S. One thing NEVER get wrong pharmaceuticals. Therapeutics need new vaccine terms urgency. good , easily given treatment could final nail coffin plan staying inside rest life? Wyoming fine. Time move on. Yes, right- believe Bob6969MAGA Facebook he's clearly done ""research"". noise, blip. Deaths coming down, better watch seven day trend one day result. lot people ICU still half ever come alive.

Why would sit doses? like Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J/AZ/etc going stop making them. keep cranking out, whole world get immunized turns year immunity wanes they'll continue cranking repeat cycle. don‚Äôt actually know OP voted whether changing would result better vaccine distribution though? Indiana age-based, teachers eligible, etc.  B117: Hold beer actually heard local lawmaker oppose mask ordinance going weird rant like ""What's next? find comes sweat wear long pants?!"" Maybe ""good news"", still discussion we'll need have. Like aftermath Iraq War 2003. many people supportive beginning, like Covid lockdowns I'm sure Biden fine job, Trump admin get credit acquiring many vaccines one fastest rollouts initially.

Except [turned opportunity buy aware get driver's license, first responders, dozens nurses hospital staff everyone near put lives danger incapable understanding much every day stupid, ungrateful people. fourth time, money politics wrong.

Ah, depends whether read 'they' EU US. Two interpretations [the EU] can['t] ban export deliver everything [the US] ban export deliver [keep] everything [in] US.

Either way OP's comment poorly worded. may thinking time first hospitalized vs death time. Like said, varies state. know read local article live said there's lag day two. I'm expert means! course known covid patients, infection unknown think read take weeks added. media desperate bad news spinning great problem bad news...lol Same, great news hear! already narrative mind seek evidence support narrative rather seeking truth sign something like get driver's license? travel airplane?

There's inherent risk every activity life, person empowered make choices. seems high degree anxiety. Sorry you. Yes, optimism. proud, good, never got 1000 deaths day first place. never ""winning"" this. Cmon bro, Biden admin still using operation warp speed end February started trump. say plan structure laughable People overweight, knows health consequences. something spoken time. issue isn‚Äôt overweight people don‚Äôt know overweight comes health consequences. It‚Äôs encourage healthy living, set society assist (no good complaining obesity it‚Äôs much cheaper buy crap food, good quality nutritious meals). significant issue running around telling people fat isn‚Äôt good, doesn‚Äôt improve situation. Yet people still spend Easter families... Yes! clearer saying second. really stressed too. checking her. She‚Äôs totally feeling great now. worried. weird! likely lot ""waste"" per say slower administration adjust tiers according supply. thrown away doses hear thawed doses, lot sign ups appointments there's enough eligible people doses stay frozen move next event. 

It could lead doses wasted can't find people give extra thawed doses too, proper planning huge issue.

Though maybe Rhode Island lot states seem expanding eligibility well previous group completed order counteract problem Exactly. Don‚Äôt already estimates figures this? 
What we‚Äôre going grapple simple fact everybody terrified covid. Plenty people aren‚Äôt petrified sitting homes. 

You‚Äôre going lot people don‚Äôt get it‚Äôs worth going way for. good vaccine protection hospital numbers manageable isn‚Äôt governor country going keep putting screws mitigation measures. That‚Äôs we‚Äôll find apathy. 

That‚Äôs mind boggling doctors, like it‚Äôs mind boggling doctors anybody smokes cigarettes. much still know. PERIOD mean, things true apply Texans.  Well cases deaths falling well vaccinated many people, they're falling pretty much world despite percentage people systematic issue created previous administrations.  
Does matter power. choices made past.  


Lol, isolated grid. 1st world country thinks like this. LiKe jOkE MuSt AnTiVaX.

Course I'm antivax. I'll also downvote jokes funny. top part joke way, downvote antivax. CDC says fully vaccinated people finally post indoor gatherings they‚Äôve already having

Saw twitter lol Last math difference age groups really big, difference 70 year old 50 year old dying around factor 100. kid risk probably higher traffic accidents COVID, still get grandma sick though. Developed drug-substance production Leiden, Netherlands Janssen Vaccines. Janssen Vaccines part Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., Belgian company. subsidiary American Johnson &amp; Johnson company.

And added confusion, name *Janssen* common family name Dutch language translated English would become *Johnson*. Janssen, means Johnson English, subsidiary Johnson &amp; Johnson even though companies shared history one acquired other. actual thrust piece lot vaccines available, next challenge countering vaccine hesitancy. Unfortunately read PANIC lines actually get reasonable message. 

Another crap piece messaging save Science Communication class, lol! Repeating joke ad nauseum likely extends lifespan original lies, too. I've read least articles last year basically said people believe whatever hear often, even they're hearing criticism idea. really unfortunate see EU struggling balance citizens supporting countries US takes attitude.

Hopefully end May US done things start balance also ship countries well. know joke, I've actually seen pandemic deniers saying really case, vaccines. I'd rather avoid low probability low probability 10 year old son dying.

The messaging / plan sucks parents right now. 

We're gonna vaccinate 70-80% pop kids make 1/3rd population they're ineligible. 

Public health officials staying quiet one know make sense. mentality people basically existence independently acting nations states. you, might seem obvious Brit might rational preference people Great Britain vaccinated ahead someone Turkmenistan. citizen world, vaccines developed produced Great Britain sense British vaccines - belong world distributing equally basically hoarding. I'm opinion people hesitant, start nearing 60%+ population vaccinated people hesistant begin realize vaccines safe go get one, they'll anecdotal evidence friends family got shot.

Absolutely true, lot providers 60+ now, classes. Since late comers, lots cancellations shows, means allocating doses fast enough.

Pretty much physicians board certified, though. That's really distinguishing designation. Yes would, think states rapidly expanding eligibility. looking ohio daily supply vs daily vaccinated numbers good sized gap.

But understand everything need much Time here. Yes, exactly. even bad allergies call flu. REALLY frustrating. 

I really sorry hear went LO. Seeing sick heartbreaking. scary stuff. really feel like people look death statistics surrounding flu think ""oh happen me"" like know develop bad pneumonia sick 6 months? Like even die still AWFUL live through.

I hope go rest lives without getting flu again. Best wishes you. Maybe people worried trials, we‚Äôve vaccinated 300 million people worldwide. dangerous side effects ‚Äî clear, dangers would comparable COVID mortality warrant refusing shot ‚Äî we‚Äôd know now. say ""That's bingo"" Many places US barely restrictions months now. states may slower lift them, they‚Äôll gone summer.  Lmao Key phrase article's headline "" vaccine proved effective clinical trials. ""

Spreading vaccine purchases many products/manufacturers way hedge failures right move. PLENTY reasons criticize Trump admin, one them. day 360 2 weeks flatten curve. Give up, over. way see doses administered manufacturer US? Seems like everyone I‚Äôve talked around received Moderna. assume there‚Äôs logistical reason it, it‚Äôs kind interesting. They're going focusing social impact versus health impacts

Bingo. would huge mistake utilize messaging. American relatives talk people countries? Except fact we‚Äôve working coronavirus vaccines decade. One would think one 5+ year ailments would arisen point. Yes, legitimate plan? initially concerned long term affects. got vaccine anyway flew October....packed plane, fine. mean technically means previous days higher counts, making drop actual cases reported yesterday (I think around 45k?) even larger sheer volume vaccines they‚Äôre going produce year incredible. China powerhouse.  exodus already happening

Exodus? exodus? feelings valid even causes reasonable. Whether prom, first years college, birthdays count, lost lot. 

Your mom may trying help get past disappointment, coming dismissive. true probably thinking 50th birthday, mean suck now. 

It's ok sad even angry. sacrifices matter, even valid reasons. able sign vaccine spring, wish best summer ever. can't bring back lost, keep enjoying things soon can. English relatives seem almost enjoy talking America people way long remember

Ok sure, American relatives also like talk Americans. Everybody likes talk everybody. Correct, generally expensive. believe seen advertised $10 without insurance can't totally sure. would believe county health department cost would take calling scheduling appointment. Perhaps offer walk-up flu shot clinics though, normal times. I'm sure could go grocery store/local pharmacy ask too. may allotment vaccines available store-sponsored initiative too. Yep, government trash again. _sigh_ Um. No. Biden‚Äôs all. It‚Äôs evil pharmaceutical companies guys love hate saving world. think Canada like $35, maybe even less. Yeah get point. I'm one major cities Texas. There's lot conservative people area. experience, people think America best simply even thinking countries doing.

They defend things going wrong country, really pay attention countries doing.

I realize entirely dependent social circles personal experiences. think idea perception Americans love talk stereotype that's blown way proportion. first link shows many children caught Covid *very few* died complications it.

The link says 172 children died entire country, representing 0.01% children caught Covid.

In 2019, children younger 12 died car crashes, 97,000 injured. Yet people put children cars every day benefits getting somewhere car. Cars much, much, much deadlier Covid child.

The reason currently important children social-distance mask continue spread Covid communities (though much older people). community risk lower, children absolutely forced stay socially-distant coming Fall, maybe sooner.

Your second link refutes this. even read it? Vaccines young children least year away. Requiring child stay socially-distant get vaccine sentencing least another year homeschool, ""the fall."" ""REPORTED"" death toll 1,000

This country whack report track everything believe report all. Herd immunity.  Remember taboo? Yeah, anyone points northeast ‚Äúfailure lockdowns‚Äù intellectually honest. 

The vast majority deaths happened March/April last year, covid silently building weeks even testing available know bad getting. 

By time clear, hospitals overflowing bodies began piling unlike anything else saw pandemic America. 

Not mention shutdowns, implemented *did* work slowing stopping rate deaths. What's funny even mask mandate, enforcement said mandate *still* primarily responsibility businesses. least keeping mandate, businesses refer back enforcement. Thanks. Still kinda disappointing means earlier data wasn‚Äôt quite accurate I‚Äôm glad reason increase. Twitter claim fatphobic, never happen. *But Florida hiding bodies Everglades!*  real. know yet long-term effects covid (especially heart/lungs). think lot scarier.

From mechanism standpoint, mRNA vaccines seem super safe, mRNA degrades, there's lingering foreign substances body. cells degrade mRNA rapidly.  person city travel rural areas get vaccinated desperately wants to? pockets sure, scale. goes bit article (55% CA residents live counties high social vulnerability score, defined CDC, vs 25% FL residents). overwhelming affects obese. 78% hospital cases deaths obese people make 40 percent American population.  Plenty healthy old people covid minimal symptoms paranoid high-risk maintaining masking distancing

I'll keep wearing mask while. I'm ""paranoid"" takes 5 seconds day may save someone fever sickness. Yes, another user brought last thread this. Scary. well theory younger folks would statistically likely able fight covid even vaccine. also easier keep dosage one instead two them. Sputnik 5 vaccine safe effective studies suggest I‚Äôm this. need push global eradication that‚Äôs going take lot vaccines currently have. literally upper limit. outbreak follows logistic growth pattern.  think safe include series winter storms kept 3/4 country inside weeks. getting another assist spring weather appears. funny seem betraying inherent lack knowledge medicine questioning medical professionals capabilities provide medical care. Israel first place recognise implications allowing people greater freedoms others. details article nonexistent.

If still facilities produce vaccines EU, already running full capacity making Pfizer, Moderna, AZ, J&amp;J vaccines? Sputnik vaccine made cheaper/less high tech equipment materials? understand EU would producing vaccine yet approved EU others have. good news already going out. [CDC says we've delivered 2.70M administered 209k J&amp;J doses. guess we'll find 4-8 weeks...

That homophobic shithead utterly incompetent since predicted 10% hetero population would die AIDS, we'd vaccine 18 months...in 1984. would guess multi-week even month backlog reporting places much ""direct line"" public health authorities. perhaps knew lot waiting finished milestone record keeping publishing them. I‚Äôve read multiple sites J&amp;J delivery numbers Netherlands (and thus also EU) promising.

This aged like milk. Ahh, personal anecdotes! best evidence. So, paid work? You‚Äôre really good it. though? Since 3 stop hospitalizations/deaths, younger people likely go nightclubs significant chance spread, would think opposite. slight correction: documented spreading events since masks made mandatory. then, cases limited spread plane, seats over. Yup, 69 year old dad felt nothing. even arm soreness. weird. figured 2 3 relevant comments slipping right unfounded personal attacks. Keep guarantee eventually actually land decent insult. mean tenacity narrowmindedness certainly make lack decent genes intelligence. P.S correct spelling ""Sooooo"" ""So"" one ""o"". Thanks taking time show skills! good things. HAGD means, let's stop generalizing! common generalization COVID-19 severe older people. Let's drop stupid generalization start vaccinating everyone every age! Missouri added bunch backlogged antigen tests. Like 50k. 500k dead. Pick cities US. remove city. Thats many people died. handful left sounds right. would ""blame"" producing vaccine? France second last don‚Äôt include Russia, Brazil, India, UK :) isn‚Äôt situation. America Israel saying don‚Äôt enough data whether virus transmitted vaccinated even well vaccine efficacy hold variants vaccinated exposed virus laden unvaccinated people. 

America saying even though doesn‚Äôt data, wants vaccinated people unvaccinated ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù people feel comfortable getting together without masks. Presumably, CDC ok people getting mild covid (my FL governor would pleased!). 

Reversed, CDC care lowered efficacy variants unvaccinated person might bring older sick person whose immune response vaccine may great begin with? allowing unvaccinated people people‚Äôs homes reasons related something data disease transmission (like mental health). explicitly state instead acting like advice related disease transmission. 

Israel waiting data. 

Two counties, one (America) getting loose (Israel) waiting data. 

Pfizer tremendous access Israel‚Äôs health data, don‚Äôt think take long get betters answers. Anecdotal, I've going gym 6 months (excluding winter closed again) never gotten sick, far know, one gym gotten sick (I've asked anyone called it, etc)

Verrrrrry little spread linked back gyms. Ultimately, risk tolerance decide, remember, someone actually sick spread cases absolutely plummeted lately. get sick simply existing space others Thank you. They're generally expensive they? health insurance. Hmm, that's odd given places adjacent pretty much equal response. Spain Italy. don‚Äôt blame tbh.

The EU fucked vaccine acquisition expecting every single member wait fuck again? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There‚Äôs fuckton variables consider. doesn‚Äôt mean bad intent ‚Äúthey‚Äù point EU, US, probably India need sit plot path forward vaccine production leverages strengths, mitigates weaknesses move forward intelligently compassionately. Probably need invite UK well. 

The US reeling December/January, still great vaccine rollout, dang close front liners 65+ vaccinated better lot countries. think behooves us take longer view see US better neighbor vaccine playground producer consumer.  I'm liberal taken Covid seriously extremely frustrated anyone downplaying deadly been.

That said really shocked popular trend liberals realize vaccines going get us back normal quickly. fucking miracle least 2/3rds adult population vaccinated short time. Many unvaccinated significant immunity already virus. Deaths going decrease every single week out. far hitting low point hospitalizations getting started. Going summer huge portion population vaccinated mean 95% normal life possible. That's amazing, celebrate scientific achievement instead getting stuck pessimistic state mind despite objectively rapidly improving outlook. 

We've spent year focused overloading hospitals noble cause. portion pandemic America vulnurable population getting vaccinated. That's amazing.  Also starting March 17, vaccine sites state able vaccinate anyone eligible shots. Previously, certain vaccine sites focused certain continue administer shots age 60 teachers, Cuomo said.

This great news exactly hoping see - open people keep pharmacies 65 (I guess 60 now) age group. 

I wish employee thing anyone works public works office. fact - someone public facing employee deal public 20-30 seconds time, vs someone whos office 200+ people 8 hours dont deal pubilc. latter group exposed imo. (im wfh none applies me, know people work offices people arent masking lax shit rules people still locked thats unfair) think big amount minority also nervous sort long term effects feel fair thing think about. saying vaccines safe nobody knows could sort effects way road nobody thought about. you? mostly conservative people / areas America love talking experience, also used lot prevelant past, mainstream talk shit America seems like, least people associate (I live California, obviously best state ;) one guy worked 551 hours averaged 18 hours day, weekends included. Surprised he's still alive. Anyone know caused 7 day average new cases increase 6k last night? mean true. like Biden came said, got vaccine boys Looks like we're headed hot girl summer, lasses. talking another spike representing true risk likely happening. one wants happen, think speak realistically risk. Mask shouldn‚Äôt go down, don‚Äôt dilute real situation. believe shown clinical trials well. 

Younger people‚Äôs strong immune system stronger reaction, especially second dose. 

Everyone young know commission day 2nd dose Moderna. Even hundreds thousands doses going waste enough move needle. US getting 30 million doses week short order.

I'm discounting possibility states can't keep administration supply, point even loony states see giant backlog start opening things up. take vacation? hoping right course mutation. Right hopeful seen vaccine apprehensive new mask guidance. Apparently subreddit doesn‚Äôt share concerns fine. magic number deaths ~250. would put us lowest rate since March last year. Hospitalizations also still relatively high ~47000. magic number ~35000.

Good progress, we're still around last Nov/Dec numbers. also make h0m0s3xUa1. study last week 33% Americans currently suffering clinical anxiety due the, know, major life disruption constant fear life verge falling apart. currently sore arm excited news Awesome. Enjoy! aren‚Äôt long worst shape Achchha khabar ! seen CDC‚Äôs recommendation update vaccinated people yesterday? answer question. Shut up. fooling anyone! friend PA boyfriend got one end vaccine clinic day would throw digital certificate aimed boosting international travel, sparked privacy concerns.*   health codes‚Äù WeChat Chinese smartphone apps already required gain entry domestic transport many public spaces China.

&amp;#x200B;

If powered WeChat, ""privacy concerns"" ship sailed... hit reef, sunk. 

Snark aside, applaud effort think need something like (albeit using Pseudonymization differential privacy techniques well. think IBM already working blockchain based solution. you‚Äôre wondering people aren‚Äôt good boys girls social distancing masks, stuff like this.

No, people shitty selfish. Next claim video games cause violence people interpret COD acceptable behavior. BS.

Adults agency, read think. fail read think justify shitty actions. So, like said, resources. Also, realize UK, Italy, Portugal, Belgium Spain seen COVID deaths (relative size) US, right? would waaay worse still without masks lock down.

Except places gonna last tho states reopening... Look 7 day average world. gone recent weeks referred to. Yes, still call assholes. don‚Äôt think major national story.  Reduced community spread due restrictive health orders winter. lifted, starting see another increase cases. blow mind -- look year later. There's crazy people U.S. around world want live bullshit world want face fact attitudes got 530,000 Americans counting killed.

Your question perfectly reasonable -- hopefully links gave something think about. I'm making numbers, specifically responding comment ""We wear masks around unvaccinated everyone wants vaccine get one"" assumed people would know percentage eligible it. apologies. could point CDC recommending toss masks garbage way first shot, expect know know that.

As pointed out, number (92%) 2 days old. article today saying 95.2% received least first shot: [Israel Vaccine Data: Many Already Inoculated 53.7 percent Israelis received first dose coronavirus vaccine, 41.5 percent second. lmao ok dude. sure even posting already expert. quite perplexing! 

and yeah fyi pharmacist make expert conducting trials yeah think want. smart. bad flu long time

That's like changing timing belt car ""well engine blow yet it"" damn sure change timing belt every 100k miles, (if car one) engine will, best cease function, worst, cost engine. (some engines designed way timing belt failing cause motor break, case cars timing belt)

Just like get flu vaccine, *will* get flu. matter time luck. Maybe get vacation big deal. maybe get work week miss week 2. definitely get flu without vaccine.

You totally get flu vaccine every year. Even free, I've never heard being, never expensive all. I'd rather avoid low probability low probability 10 year old son dying.

As parent, I'm also extremely risk averse son's health, actually look research math here. There's chance ten year old actually catches COVID die. suspect chance single visit vaccinated person COVID symptoms result ten year old catching COVID close 0%, let's say 0.1% (in practice suspect significantly less long middle huge COVID case spike, let's use number sake argument). math assumptions right, chance ten year old dying visit vaccinated person less 0.0000002%. that's true, literally every single ten year old US could receive one visit fully vaccinated person chances even *one* ten year olds would die less 1%. Health risk ten year olds receiving visits vaccinated people infinitesimally small point worrying protecting contracting COVID vaccinated family members harmful missing years socialization development love. Note math apply higher risk populations like We're gonna vaccinate 70-80% pop kids make 1/3rd population they're ineligible.

Ineligible now. change coming months trials start demonstrate safety younger younger age Public health officials staying quiet one know make sense.

It makes sense kids ineligible prove vaccine safe them. research already underway. California still growing population. Migration factor.

People moving California getting expensive. getting expensive? people want live there. basic supply demand.

Are free market dynamics? Agreed. this, welcome problems. first link says, ""More 2 million children diagnosed COVID-19, including 1 million since mid-November.

New data AAP Children‚Äôs Hospital Association show nearly 179,000 COVID-19 cases children reported last week alone, bringing total least 2,000,681 Dec. 24. Children make 12.4% total cases U.S.

*At least* 172 children died Dec. 17.""

The second link one off-hand comment, ""... clinical trials kid‚Äôs vaccine underway, although *may* take another year receive data produce vaccine, it‚Äôs promising news.""

And third link says, literally headline, ""Fauci: Vaccines Kids Young First Graders Could Authorized September"" article says, ""We‚Äôre process starting clinical trials call age de-escalation, clinical trial people 16 12, 12 9, 9 6,‚Äù Fauci said. asked youngest age group might authorized vaccine September, said, ‚ÄúI would think time get school opening, likely able get people come first grade.‚Äù

Hence, could sooner fall.

Enough bullshit. Case point : Israel. low number cases deaths among elderly covid, lots cases teenagers young adults last couple weeks.  Good India!!! Pot kettle etc. could determine whatever affecting caused Covid look something else. would mostly help Doctors themselves.  unfollowed people posting crap fb feed done wonders mental health. Yep, long haul covid still major issue addressed sooner rather later, either treatment vaccination (I've seen article somewhere good chunk long haulers improve significantly full vaccination, we'll see rollout continues). people cannot deny immediate shifting narrative came Biden's victory

I deny that. happen Asian countries put plans (and resources execute them) place SARS. US Europe never that. started race 100 laps ahead.

But US EU started point. There's excuse essentially genocide opposition using term modern history reserved race/religion rather socioeconomic status.

It's worth noting much ""reopened"" within 72hrs NY Gov Cuomo announcing deaths back/brown people. pure coincidence. Go India !

 Dhanyavaad don‚Äôt understand can‚Äôt mention anything health risks Covid kids without getting debate schools. 

Because 99% time people bring risk COVID kids, argument trying justify need keep schools closed.

What want keep kids safe going deprive proper education development? I'm ears. Hahaha. type blood please keep educating trained pharmacist. sure credentials quite...startling. a,mighty fine reader! wont lie, coworkers kids say kids (pre-teen &amp; teenagers) happy. (this report workplace northeast USA) federal governments job distribute vaccine states: states would determine would go there. love I've saying we'll back mostly normal around June. I'm sticking it. lot places open earlier, think June going even stricter places drop all/most restrictions. never plan, states ones continued could roll vaccines. Trump administration nothing help rollout. theory, yes. technology could used determine immune system's memory is, usually lasts much longer antibodies. I‚Äôm going friends wedding, I‚Äôll mask it‚Äôs outside feel safe wedding. Fantastic response thank sounds like allergic reaction normal side effects shot brings. Usually side effects wouldn‚Äôt develop hours injection. Mine started two three hours whereas girlfriend‚Äôs side effects took twelve hours appear.

If get reaction dose two, I‚Äôd let people site know reaction first shot. 

Did utilize V-Safe all? Yesterday CDC guidance came first time felt like crawling skin this. California still vaccinating 65+, notion they're going get around people age.

Been year, able wait another month two, holy shit would gladly step dying Marin antivax soccer mom get shot. oh hey like normal times! (plane crashes much rare car crashes, past i've found thinking way plane/getting jitters) Aww Americans always think binary form.

I'm sure believed Saddam WMD Actually, fish ""turned gay"" chemicals contraceptives waste water. Michigan's efforts vaccinate teachers exactly stellar either though. know struggling get one despite considered 1b though. rate going Indiana going push adults slightly behind Michigan getting teachers vaccinated.

It really looks like tiers causing problems, confusion, delays. Hahaha problems look forward Keep adding treatments arsenal. Love vaccines, 100% toolbox use needed great. ok guess conducting studies know less random person giving vaccine lol. there's whole list reasons one might reaction. recently believe Type less likely reactions yeah go ahead think people getting duds. Even hypothetically perfect data perfect predictive models, people still implement different strategies. countless examples data science world models predicted would happen, mean people receiving info implemented perfect strategy.

I one find interesting yet unsurprising two vastly different approaches given presumably similar data. Florida‚Äôs system ridiculous. sucks u Same, I'm taking mask hit 70-80% vaccinated. mutations kind scaring me, know logical since vaccines seem still decent job I'd really hate fuck right end bring home variant I'm attacking you, want demonstrate think awful analogy. Yeah change OS permission to, permission, trust change OS. OS extra security like System Integrity Protection makes hard alter OS even purpose full root access.

It awful analogy. Call Virus Killing Instructions paper form scientists easily fill teach bodies defeat sorts different things. probably sucks reason, least conflated something spooky massively complicated malware, trojans, viruses, worms, adware, etc. wait governors screw again. Guess school kids tested twice week. Nah Understood. Thanks explanation. get 95% gotten first dose?????  many doses per 100 people given. 55% gotten first dose 42% 55% gotten 2nd dose. they're 95% yet, Kind weird downvote jokes funny rather scrolling by. really deep big guy Yeah California data anything shows value restrictions. state‚Äôs winter surge got start restrictions mostly lifted came control several weeks new restrictions imposed.

If California hadn‚Äôt lifted many restrictions summer surge numbers compared Florida‚Äôs would even better already are.

This isn‚Äôt really comparison state restrictions state continuous strict restrictions since beginning pandemic. It‚Äôs comparison state relatively restrictions state gone several distinct phases moderate restrictions. European countries resources disposal Asian countries. clear takes resources disposal. point still stands, France really room making fun anyone else's covid response.

Just like I'm America dare making fun anyone else's covid response. Here's harder pill swallow (especially dems): despite anything leader did, country ""did right"" defeated virus, kept spreading countries. could mitigate. That's it.

Before start talking NZ, lets remember NZ two small islands, population smaller NY. STILL could completely contain virus.

Everyone sems amnesia constant ""IF XYZ! failure govt. care!"" turns XYZ actually stop anything, mitigate. First link woman gut issues fixed wound eating more. surprise.

Second link nothing weight. people's cholesterol levels pathologically high. tend die young. sad. Oh bad, it‚Äôs actually people downvoting emotionally unstable ones shitting anger, right? completely agree lol. born Uruguay lived part life part Uruguay borders Brazil absolutely can‚Äôt compare even safer parts South America US. annoying living here, quality life better, it‚Äôs cheaper, get dollar would South America, don‚Äôt feel anxious walking night, etc.  don‚Äôt think Euro 2020 held multiple countries. Okay that's discussing. talking fully vaccinated people choosing go store without mask, still getting shamed judged ""We KnOw WhO's VaCcInAtEd!!"" point rapidly approaching line 1/4th country vaccinated. going skyrocket there. point pro-maskers accept maybe job anymore point shame? last point highlights issue marketing masks country. never moralized way been; fact people unironically believe wearing mask=you care human beings absurd. become like religious talisman meant signify ""one good ones."" gone completely beyond scope originally meant do, sooner get rid them, better. Similarly Facebook, comments Covid-19 news videos.

Some people can't connect fact flu virtually non-existent year fact socially distancing wearing masks. question two ineffective Covid, reality reason Covid-19 numbers way higher. actually feel within 10 minutes shot, dizziness mouth got super puckered dry felt spaced out. people monitoring site said go home rest, did. Er...i told different one administering vaccine. Thanks take word it. I'm fully aware kind risk might happen. That's said job, parents, make sure help best can. Yes, I'm square. fuckin reddit brother linkedin :) feels good actual end date literally point getting it

I mean whole getting hospitalized dying thing pretty cool fucking shit Agreed. sleeping giant finally awakened. go!!! go kill!!! ...... (im also old,try use well) actually 90% vaxed, many doses per 100 people given, 55% population one shot, 42% fully vaccinated two shots Asymptomatic boogaloo find impossible believe state go back anything less like 99% normal. I‚Äôm even sure remnant could possibly be. Maybe like slightly robust/prepared contact tracing apparatus states? extra laws contact wild animals...? Surely you‚Äôre suggesting CA state would even consider keeping something like masks banned gatherings permanently. US vastly resources disposal European countries. There's much less excuse US's poor response.

Reality 80%+ US deaths totally avoidable, leadership felt good ""sacrifice"" political points.

If Middle Eastern African nation behaved US did, would talking embargo's regime changes country abused citizens badly. Hell currently strangle governments killed less citizens.  Karens. Ivanas Yes I'm mad, clearly asking valid question I've shown I'm emotionally unstable currently shitting anger. use engineered version virus instead actual virus? yes, people are. rules vary state/county/city though. Ja. Germany. Fuck fuck up. way slow. Vaccines, People turn it‚Äôs ‚Äúwrong‚Äù one. Fucking idiots everywhere look. far away think test/quarantine free travel across country? wow 1000 significant, meaningful number. Good luck! see note availability Ashtabula? Hope one works you. making excuses try justify needing vaccine passports, know why. remember we're looking aggregate behaviors groups, anecdotes subject confirmation/ selection bias. easy overlook old folks careful see them.

A lot people died Florida kinds activities mentioning probably explain lot deaths. important consider significant proportion 65+ folks cautious. FL group likely safe COVID cautious 65+ folks living intergenerational homes LA. Yeah saw graph days ago convinced JJ effective mRNA ones. three data got better better time.  point I'd prefer get stuck let body work.  Sign fuck though traveled world never needed show evidence vaccines. 

Now pretending otherwise? told it‚Äôs much easier make BioNtech vaccine hence better vaccine world. John Hoptkins tracker Sunday lower number - much like daily cases death numbers prior day often case deaths (but even vaccinations cases extent) days weeks well. Drive himself. Don‚Äôt expose poor cabbie.  TL;DR: period Dec. 20, 2020 Feb. 01, 2021, study 600,000 individuals, Pfizer/Biontech vaccine showed efficiency expected trials (94-96%).

After first shot, found 57-62% effective, quite important miss second shot optimal performance. still, still, still! confusing terms.

Transmissible vaccinated people implies people infected virus. comment reads. logic written, suggests immune virus still pass virus onto others. extreme outlier nature. **Why none COVID vaccines FDA Approved?**

I able ask one expert able give list actions still needed complete. I've tried reaching experts media can't find answer, reaching here.

We know FDA granted three vaccines EUAs, allowing us administer unapproved vaccines. question left done FDA approve them.

I guesses (I'm expert), maybe FDA Approval vaccine requires tested children teenagers? know running trials right get results year next. Testing pregnant women, also required FDA Approval? Again, working speak.

Anyways, hope get lot hate asking question. Would really appreciate list steps still needed vaccines FDA Approved. resource somewhere internet explains process what's missing? Indiana almost entirely age based health care workers. states seem several categories people eligible. It‚Äôs hoax according comments Let's replace bullets little syringes filled vaccine send murderers shoot anti-vaxxers. This. way picky point. need shots arms now. popular decision (except AZ, course).

AstraZeneca ""delivered less 10% amount ordered EU period December March"" That's impossible. PCR test looks viral material, including lot spike protein. Moderna vaccine contain except mRNA coding spike protein. know Rabbi Israel preaching anti vax secretly went get vaccine. sad. 
Im sorry situation makes feel hide that. Let's skip day 11 months like elevators used skip floor 13, problem solved. start counting days 0 make missing date. Dijkstra would approve. Political bloggers background medicine epidemiology get \*all\* science news days, I'm really glad /r/Coronavirus added mix favorite sources. think work solving problem reservation level. don‚Äôt think people reserving times, sign told appointment is. Then, sort risk always assign next appointments risk people signed up.
Obviously it‚Äôs difficult problem solve, problem disappearing every day, since 60% elderly already gotten first shot. forgot /s Possible issues, even able get shot:

Will around Tampa 12 weeks, whatever, get second dose?

They set appointment second shot day get first one. Unless J&amp;J shot, unclear. doubt letting people choose shot want point. old you? parents anti vaxxers? Afaik pfizer vaccine [less effective sa Hell no. number friends family anti-vax overall (their kids vaccinated, far know, get flu shots), expressed skepticism vaccines terms safety. 

Instead trying win research data (I tried, mostly work), instead going proudly openly announce get vaccine. think lot skeptics need see people know going first things turning fine, they'll get themselves. Happy one test subjects. educator (or educated)... would get fact CDC estimated start 2021 around 30% US already natural immunity infections. Sure overlap group group getting vaccines, still enough create major slowdown cases point entire country posting thousands cases / day deaths 100 / day - point would level lower flu deaths year. referring actual link inaccuracies  yellow fever vaccine passport. piece paper clinic administered it, branded store information. standardized verifiable. 

Also, yellow fever contagious disease among humans, vaccine passports different intent. trump still twitter bet would take credit this. state 20% population 65 older?

This bit simplistic. there's 65+ couple wealthy living alone, they're far less likely get COVID couple lives children intergenerational family (who may essential jobs generally irresponsible).

So elderly population California (or, say, LA specifically) likely arrangement elderly population Florida, may outweigh age advantage. Keep mind Bay Area (also populated area) much, much better LA despite state. Even nearby Orange/ SD counties 1/3rd population 1/5th 1/6th deaths. 

It seems pretty plausible main thing made LA poorly. least near me, seems like worked week two word got lists got super long. I've added half dozen past week luck yet. 60+ 45-60 comorbidities  numbers always release early afternoon, way shots could possibly done evening I'm sure /u/CrumbsAndCarrots feels rest world sees US able tackle/solve problems effectively efficiently.

The world viewed US decline since Bush (or possibly even Vietnam), low expectations us, enjoys proven right fail validate low expectations. laugh keep crying, laugh makes feel better themselves, easier point laugh US's faults, rather acknowledge face problems country's.

To expect countries send vaccines country pandemic population vaccinated ludicrous. house divided cannot stand. think that‚Äôs fair. Lower estimates we'd need 70% people immune hit herd immunity.

CureVac results expected? mandatory vaccinations, mostly basis body autonomy. Forcing people inject substances bodies name ""national security"" dangerous line thinking.

Most governments seem avoid law mandates vaccine, open human rights worms. However, loophole. Instead restricting laws citizens get vaccine, restrict laws citizens ""allow freedoms"" citizens vaccinated. think dishonest, governments want make extremely inconvenient vaccine, make clear want force everyone take it, instead mixing words ""granting limited freedoms"", ""vaccinate return normal"". We're getting 100 deaths first time since October UK. Also cases rapidly dropping every week! vaccination drive incredible. I'm 26 vaccinated Saturday. research published New England Journal Medicine found engineered version virus, containing mutation carried spike protein highly contagious P1 variant first identified Brazil, effectively neutralised among people given jab.

1/4 per base pair definitely accurate (~10^-6 vs. 3x10^-5 I've seen). 1/2 per genome significant metric. genomes different compositions certain areas mutations matter vaccination. larger genome mutate more, also mutate meaningless places (or individual mutations may level significance). Expert consensus, far tell, SARS-CoV-2 far less susceptible vaccine-escape flu. volume infections (i.e. chances mutate) dies globally, easier control flu.

Right we‚Äôre administering 2.1 million doses per day. 

Something got give actually want get vaccines administered ASAP less 1k actually they're still dropping pretty consistently. monday lowest drop day usually never know, maybe covid-19 100 evelution points saved up. Ok? point sometimes is.

Basically, gist people exchanged behaviors going public places like restaurants gyms hanging friends home. number cases US state strongly tied many different social connections populace tends engage average (2 3 core people vs dozens people, example). Lockdowns address kind behavior explicitly -- indicate people behave general also destroying local business economy. 

It's due lack nuance messaging. advice given public health generalized (stay 6' away, wear mask, talk anyone), rather based specifics common sense (i.e.: people thinking capable transmission &lt;6' indoors need wear mask walk past someone hiking trail &lt;2 seconds). 

Another issue -- least US -- lack end goal. CDC say something like: get X, Y, Z data, lift kind restriction. Instead keep saying wait, people get frustrated start shirking. EU bunch third world countries Gucci trenchcoat.

Don't get wrong. different freedoms came twenties -- money, one -- little regrets. I'm rare person whose twenties great! yeah, college blast. rare side effect. Common expected response think shows people this. Especially way vaccine rolling out. That's whining, then.

There limited numbers vaccines huge demand. two choices: ration time production catches demand, withhold vaccines there's enough supply meet demand. latter course would lead far illness death.

I'm actually rather happy hear people get back normality, people work industry get back earning money supporting families, etc. Fucking yes! worse vaccine I've ever solider army seemingly vaccinated every disease universe. None compared Moderna vaccine got couple weeks ago.

All throughout March, contacts significantly decreased everyone. mid April onwards, contacts kept rising whole year. Yes are, US based outlets since start still it. Fantastic.

That problem. means somebody getting credit. Except person article two wars. So... work travel industry, boomer vacations enough make difference industry whole really saving us. bitter fuck able see family abroad unless spend almost 3 weeks mandatory quarantine (10 days side), older people go beach holiday. like last summer government ""eased"" tourism industry's concerns allowing people quarantine-free travel 3 countries declared rules would last entire summer, really benefitted one specific area tourism industry, local holiday homes already getting lot demand people looking staycations. helping us, faster vaccine rollout providing alternative ways people travel till vaccinated thing will. 

We put lives hold primarily higher risk, think disrespectful hell jump straight back normalcy high risk lockdown conditions many months come. Personally think get freely travel can, set quick-test centres everywhere use proof alternative vaccine. Lol attended wedding last month 75 people wife 4 others wearing masks. fatigue real many people dont care. US laughing stock world. don‚Äôt need recap last 5yrs governments pandemic response. lived US 6yrs long ago heartbreaking see country changed. I‚Äôm glad see things looking now. OK good luck that! need understand relative risks keep things proportion.

In case, [Reuters analysis shown vaccine sera neutralise all, knows. Perhaps simply able protect low neutralising titres LOD, would handy. here. couple dozen variations. None defeat available vaccines tho. implied (medical professionals) stealing it, too!

Yes disgusting accuse hard working healthcare workers stealing PPE (and even ventilators one point, medical workers going back door ventilator selling black market). remember that. man shame. moaned 'empty cupboards' White House meeting care people spoke dying patients.

Well done husband difficult job time, getting thanks President, instead crap Trump threw profession. healthcare workers planet share, we'd terrible situation now. correct. went FEMA site Florida get vaccinated, ton teachers know. Pfizer runs out. wasn‚Äôt given choice, I‚Äôm glad got Pfizer. coworker went later day got J&amp;J one left. number upvotes story says otherwise. small trial, vaccines huge robust trials. wait comparable results getting ahead ourselves. Thanks! take mean moderna elitist cd8+ t-cells, cd4+, whereas Pfizer seems elicit both? thoughts implications would be?

I sort hoping info come elicit went back looked study getting lot buzz last week seems indirectly imply elicit approximately t-cell responses (cd4+ cd8+) guess sort answers question. Florida 50%, probably closer 40% today. real test next two weeks based trend growth B.1.1.7 strain probably start overwhelm decline original variant (the B.1.1.7 strain still spreading rapidly). 

The good news vaccinations existing natural immunity pretty much impossible another December/January-like surge B.1.1.7. would surprised cases see slight uptick coming weeks Florida, eventually counteracted several weeks later rising population immunity vaccines (on top existing case load). Covid: ""You'll stone dead moment."" Hahaha, oh wow, COVID denier. Meth crack? Narrator: not. Trump disaster, vaccine development streamlined FDA approval process well done. rollout vaccine pretty awful getting much better actual federal leadership.

Anyone calling warp speed failure hack can't admit Trump administration one thing right. probably true. fair though, vaccinated ton people state. There's something like 2.9 million adults state, 0.6 million received prime doses far. sure showing J&amp;J data yet. people phase 3. seem pretty good acceptance among groups open to, I'm sure lot rural seniors opted out.

i‚Äôll bring gum Well least won‚Äôt worry president withholding vaccine distribution exchange political favors. guess realistic view perhaps perception what‚Äôs happening much thoughts camp. hope I‚Äôm wrong. fauci still urge us wear two masks 2025, dine-in daily case number zero US. üôàüôäüôâ boils to. I've never seen enforced strictly. store? I‚Äôm tempted hang pharmacy around closing knows probably still places break, seems like big nothing burger me. think unreasonable say politicians took advantage situation, though. vaccine free Americans. 1 3 developed country awful. shows far America fallen rate seen acceptable. long we're science sub: reading anyone trying obtain antiviral influenza studies standard definition diagnostic criteria applied, statistical analysis study reports concluded benefit similar vein, systematic review systematic reviews, published PLOS One April 2013 concluded oseltamivir provide treatment benefit elderly risk groups affect rate hospitalization mortality. sum up, cumulative risks prevail small benefits oseltamivir prophylaxis treatment influenza healthy words, benefits overplayed, harms underplayed reporting trials. It‚Äôs federally subsidized, need health insurance. Go find appointment, sign up, get shot, pay nothing! remove mask brief moments, drinking. According sub pandemic already over. Yup. I'm going fully vaccinated April 6...and family going Disney World April 10th celebrate. cannot WAIT. Thanks! Somehow missed announced it. eerily similar Ontario Canada.

Variants taking hold, we've barely started vaccinating anyone (thanks Trudeau) I'm afraid vaccines can't come fast enough stop coming now.

Toronto locked 5 months (Bars, restaurants, gyms, salons etc) end site 3rd wave seemingly starting people done. 30% Americans lost minds. flu four years ago, doctor told immediately go redi-clinic CVS Rite Aid whatever. flu tests instant results give tamiflu. 

It cut sickness six days pure hell instead 12. None really even fair comparison they're much serious.

Within 5 years COVID-19 likely viewed similarly flu terms seriousness. Treatments drive mortality rate people worried contracting it. point sort reduced attendance athletic event.

Trust me, olympians see point.

And vast majority people watching TV anyway. Yeah like people listen... come on.. look outside, people without mask still everywhere. swim across lake Erie, 50 miles! Thank anecdote. It‚Äôs negative anecdotes past year. don't. Bing question easily find answer. they're providing thresholds. Scientists, we've learned past year, risk averse. clear pushing zero-COVID policy. really anything different trump. Governors run show. Thank you! Israel really equal restrictions, people. assume motivator decision.

Even though, look videos Purim holiday parties week ago. Almost one wears masks Tell Aviv Jerusalem younger population far lower risk begin with. That‚Äôs thought well. None large ones state seem story fishy. Every doctor know would either 1) give appointment day, 2) recommend go rite aid flu test get Tamiflu (they that) 3) tell go hospital feel bad. Cool, thank you. Kids need socialization. it. body choice qualify yesterday, need figure without Healthcare Careful, doom gloom circlejerk sub doesn‚Äôt like remotely positive comments.  fuck people prepare food. Agreed, I'm glad handshakes particular taboo now...absolutely hate handshakes. really care says. enjoy summer. Kids back school too. getting better now. It‚Äôs 90% less likely contracted first place, well. Gotcha super promising means administering vaccine, likely ready use much world already received vaccine. However, intranasal vaccine could massively change way vaccines types administered. promising future potential. Exactly. could already immunity. could mean less receptive virus anyway (type O). could immune system muted response. 

I'm sure epidemiologist could give least dozen reasons. say come Uk? one burden proof since claim UK supply lipid EU sites, whilst offer evidence case. 

I reckon proof usual. Maybe repeated point irritating some. offer enough protection I'll ready music fest. way back beginning, Florida's numbers wrong covered up. two recent articles, find way back April last Yeah literally anyone president times crisis always get reelected, well let experts work acknowledge serious lmfao Florida open since June cases dropping fast read mass media news remind real customer advertisers articles almost never written specialists. sorry this. California finally getting its‚Äô essential workers vaccinated. always experience well. stuff like flu, poison ivy, etc don‚Äôt even bother go urgent care. Flu shot helps, too. caught flash. it‚Äôs looking like epic point seriously doubt it. cant, theyve said before, year nothing 39 year-old Ohioan ready! literally every no-waste list is. I'm hoping they'll drop people 30s early April. No, actual result percentage point, ""exponentially more"". actual real world results consult here. restaurant restrictions worked, CA would be, say, ""exponentially"" better Florida. not. same.

For people claim ""believe science"", goddamn would open eyes look real world, empirical evidence contrary opinion. that's case I'll definitely come back sometime. March 15th, people BMI 25 get vaccine, basically almost everybody. case deciding doctor would state provide doctor would review neurologist. 

Technically cancer active treatment shouldn‚Äôt getting shot anyways. 
If chemo immune suppressants shot voided. literally disclaimers sign shot, friend get shot needs cancer treatment since much important them. 

But would much fair allow people chance opt vaccine requiring two doctors agree tk give checks people get shots forget people health reasons. someone intense health anxiety, completely agree Can‚Äôt sure, maybe vaccine turned gay atheist hacked caps lock /s looking good Germany. Infection numbers rising 3 weeks seems decline hospitalisations stopped 1 week ago.
The death numbers still going now, likely delayed rise next days.
Vaccinations far showing effect. Looks like little late prevent new wave.
Meanwhile planing phase lockdown despite bad numbers. people seem tired demand return normal.
I fear lot deaths severe cases over. Sure, suggests rules actually different ones news story. It‚Äôs like anyone expected somehow wear mask eating drinking. me, I'm saving up. covid karens currently looking new line attack great news! said EU manufacturing supplied Merk Evonik.

Also said US manufacturing capabilities used US vaccine manufacturing.

Where says UK manufacturing capabilities used EU vaccine production ?

You read things carefully.  Probably good idea place serves refried beans, pandemic not. That‚Äôs one possible explanation. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs right. ""Exponential more"", um, no, would maybe 2-3x worse worst-case scenario. There's nation earth even death rate close levels, would assume would exponentially worse? Thanks text! Lmao Americans think world revolves around America? country hundreds thousands people died due covid including one family members doubt anyone cares Biden Sounds good me! Thanks! like it, eat someplace else! üòä saying starting believe transmission vaccinated individuals low (I know official studies published) mean thinking people vaccinated give disease non vaxxed people? going simple, things strange another year two, travel wont like 2 years ago. going take time people weren‚Äôt good place years Covid, never anytime future, either Yeah, lot time restaurant eating drinking? tend serve drinks arrive.

It's true put mask go toilet etc. Aren‚Äôt colleges also spring break year? 2 major colleges close started later simply going straight avoid students traveling returning. Oh know, living Florida sure know. still, seems like people pick choose government information believe. part, pandemic, doctors speaking usually close right information. point I‚Äôm listening doctors realistic roll times. It‚Äôs X amount doses, need way administer them. That‚Äôs barely place 65+ population state. issues double booking booking appointments last month, mom ‚Äúscheduled‚Äù dropped. ended taking month roll getting it. ‚Äúseniors get today‚Äù. I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre wrong, I‚Äôve heard many times officials state next week time next month that, doctors painting turned much note realistic picture. want able get vax tomorrow? Absolutely. think I‚Äôll get mid July? likely.  international record vaccinations mostly required people poor countries traveling US unvaccinated people traveling poor countries.

requiring domestic travel travel people rich countries rich countries would cause huge amount outrage. Yeah, that's true. sadly know everything vaccines specifically (I've loosely following them) article notes Previous studies found vaccine neutralised contagious UK South African variants even though South African variant could lower vaccine-elicited protective antibodies.

It seems like *does* work, although perhaps less effective? (If anyone knows stuff feel free correct me!) vaccinations matter schools opening spreading new variants rapidly first wave Get J&amp;J; one shot. nurse give shot. Close eyes feel anything. Done! drugs suggest live vaccines, people wait J&amp;J trials immune suppressed people. What's point? postpone 2022 hold normally Someone say mid-July, fall, wait winter, etc. 

It‚Äôs time It‚Äôs bit sad vaccine partially developed produced EU 100 million doses delivered US June struggle deliver 55 EU. guess get order late don‚Äôt pay enough upfront.. We‚Äôve experienced differently. every nurse saying it‚Äôs like war groups making tik tok dance videos mugging social media pursuit praise. think occupational therapists started using ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stay home....‚Äù frames Facebook pictures sign people want attention.  I‚Äôm well aware nurses go bar regular months.  doctors decided need more... /s posted pretty late yesterday‚Äôs discussion thread. Hoping get eyeballs daytime:

Is date information moderna vaccine eliciting t-cells? find lots info summer early fall saying Pfizer elicited cd4+ cd8+, everything see moderna time period provides either vague ambiguous info, says point didn‚Äôt, elicits cd4+ cd8+. seems kind weird can‚Äôt find much anything date it. Would reasonable assume would actually elicit similar t-cell response Pfizer? Thanks! time we've tons ""spreaders"" getting recovering covid death numbers affected all. It'll take forever get point spreaders vaccinated enough save lives. inefficient. reason vaccinations dropped drastically yesterday? really, there's also fill &amp; finish facilities Italy, Spain, India South Africa. Everybody ever worked retail tell people fact lose shit store rules don‚Äôt like, including ‚Äúno shirt, shoes, service‚Äù rules. Come on, really think it‚Äôs good idea encourage drug companies hide efficacy trial data? realize would backfire entirely people would 0 trust company unwilling publish data get vaccine... right? words shocking anti-scientific,‚Äù said Bernardo Mello Franco, columnist newspaper Globo. ‚ÄúBut influencing significant percentage people Brazil. sabotaging health measures, motivating people obey them, calling people stay home bunch cowards.‚Äù

Brazil's response nothing short complete uncontrolled outbreaks communities mounting immunity, scientists say, give rise dangerous variants. It‚Äôs coincidence one world‚Äôs virulent variants emerged Manaus, one world‚Äôs hardest-hit cities.

That's pretty terrifying observation vaccines protect variants. So, much different. interesting refreshing perspective got vaccine site giving shots anyone low demand. Hundreds lined up.

Then issue ""low demand"" broken system vaccine allocation eligibility tier. probably plateau point, guess much lower we're currently at.

This vaccine kneecapping virus. 100%. good enough end pandemic. Trump Operation Warp Speed managed pull near miracle opinion. Also current drop cases based straight immunity rather aggressive restrictions. current trend completely reliant human behavior, fortunately. mean Brazil particularly bad though right? Ohio pretty much gave reporting. Definitely still deaths Worldometers showing reported  needs shipped USA filling finishing shipped back EU. know can't done EU. He's right.

Far, far much toxicity folks can't imagine world learn live virus mitigate worst it. Seriously? read new CDC guidelines? Four KS. 

I dunno what's happening Virginia, though. Everyone go back normal whether think good idea not. Viruses always threaten humans learnt live them. know mean ""vaccine targeting death"" that's aim really make sense. vaccine allow body jump virus - time means sterilizing immunity. not, prevent severe disease. almost certainly prevent scary things talk about. also think anyone accepts 50% people permanent lung damage anything like that.

There manufacturing agreements based remember.

I hope Zydus's vaccine works well It‚Äôs already happening. you‚Äôre 2-3 million daily shots vs 60,000 new cases, things flip quickly. Totally fair XD however, statement still holds true. Pfizer earlier week Covid-19 vaccine stored warmer temperatures. Earlier, vaccine required storage temperatures -80¬∫C -60¬∫C, made vaccine less viable India.

As far tell two vaccines got low efficacy typhoid flu vaccine. Probably although I've read many conflicting info this.

* many doses sit case vaccine immunity finite
* keep equal amounts versions
* when/where start sharing over-abundance. Mexico comes mind, depending date Canada could still play. Central South America obvious next targets, need keep long eye potential hotspots places
* integrate unapproved ( ) vaccines pipeline. example Novavax. 
* shelf-life versions, play plans vaccinate non-Americans. would criminal let good vaccines expire shelf US could go arm somewhere else. insane daily deaths high long Americans care, going malls, beaches, eating out, masking, etc. lost faith people country next pandemic come. 40% March 3rd according helix database tho? don‚Äôt normally start selling things day FDA issues approval. 

It almost certainly end diagnostic test available ordering physicians. OB general doctor said recommend every pregnant woman, seem helpful me. 

To me, prior experience vaccines show human vaccines leak, yet CDC keeps saying know yet vaccinated people can't spread it, enough evidence. time say safe pregnancy trial data. I'm arguing not, inconsistency message okay me. many cases CA compared states less restrictions (which point virtually America)?

What scientific evidence need fear fourth wave somehow overpower current tidal wave vaccines people getting?

You can't call speculative fear mongering ""science"" science. That‚Äôs projection. I‚Äôve watched conversations unfold. one holds you. mean...yeah? lock basement forever. Yeah every joke worthy upvotes. generally need funny well. there's loads articles think idea body failing fully regulate correctly. 

Clinical anxiety isn‚Äôt normal anxious feelings everyone has. It‚Äôs body overreacting, dumping several chemicals like cortisol adrenaline blood stream, causing kinds havoc. Vertigo, tics, shaking, heart palpitations, etc. 

I‚Äôve seen people quietly sitting watching tv, perfectly fine, sudden where, panic. 

That‚Äôs normal, biological basis abnormality. saying covid appears changing people‚Äôs bodies become abnormal way. family shots hospital system, would call people end day shots left going expire. called family friends, ie: connections. seems possible sit around thoughts awash head someone reddit cheers up? go outside get air sun. finish line. Tamiflu significant side effects including vomiting diarrhea, exacerbate dehydration. benign medication would negligent recklessly prescribe it. Additionally, multiple national shortages it, can't ""waste"" it. gave everyone cold, people actually need it. That's happens 'you know best' listen advice people. always thinks knows subject experts. There's internet clip saying 'I know about...' things like hotels, tech, tax, business etc. sums up. 

To supporters chant 'fuck Fauci' says all. Hopefully called ""The Fourth July"" know J&amp;J worse this? Maybe I'm using wrong search terms find information this. Yeah one EVER talk it. blasted media Yet going near packed Walmart constantly shit you.

I get people paid tell people overzealous yet, activities deemed fun form escapism ones viewed super spreaders. Concerts theaters, going beach OUTDOORS risk indoors. poses bigger risk going Walmart every day browse nothing better get house go insane. inconsistent messaging leads conspiracy theories LOOOOVE hear about.

Especially CDC guidelines flaws them, showing vaccines needing do. Maybe time allow escapism here. mean, can't worse Walmart now. told carry microchip everywhere go builtin GPS tracker, already entered bank info handles personal communications, verbal text-based.  time get organized us population vaccinated render meaningless. point didn‚Äôt get vaccinated it‚Äôs kinda putting risky situation. hope people realize interconnected electricity grids good idea. Yeah Trump handled situation awfully. Biden right criticize him. None last three Republican presidents prior Trump bad job him. respectful decor kids dropped. Lots ‚Äúholy fuck‚Äù. telephoned around line remember parents heard everyone saying staring dead silence kids obliviously bounced around. Free everyone US, Americans. illegal immigrants people still working toward citizenship still catch virus, tax healthcare system, spread infection people. Well considering 40% Covid cases Florida new B117 variant, B117 hits tipping point 50% cases start spread exponentially...we shall see happens. don‚Äôt think US woods quite yet. much hinging rate vaccination. hope that‚Äôs case! It‚Äôs really important us people service industry thrives since many people depend it.

However, find hard believe 5-10% reduction volume won‚Äôt hurt lot restaurants. razor thin margins stay afloat, maybe already died 2020 ones left better shape  Aren‚Äôt South Africa Brazil variant really similar? works one work other? expect Moderna same? might say, 'Get vaccinated,¬†spend Easter family,' church might encourage people fully vaccinated sing together,"" northeastern states mentioned experienced significant portion deaths start pandemic strict protocols enacted. 

As California, younger population, population density higher. take look recent U-6 unemployment figures, difference much smaller well. California 15.1% Florida 12.8%. Deaths permanent California may lower U-6 come July Sure, primary research type sources, I've read multiple articles doctors researchers quoted saying past. example, Though there‚Äôs known individual harm receiving vaccine sick, experts fear people infected virus may spread others vaccine distribution sites.

Although presume *known* risks mean discover later. Hell, probably College anyway! strong evidence quite effective variants, particularly severe infection.

I know, saw /s people actually respond satire without seeing facts. Satire sad effect priming brain accept misinformation familiar. That's hell headline lol That's actually central question now. 5% (or whatever is, depending vaccine) vaccine work likely transmit, level similar non-vaccinated similar disease (i.e. someone gets severe covid despite vaccine likely transmit like someone got severe disease without vaccine). 

We'll need figure too, main question whether 95% transmit - protected getting sick, replicating virus. Data coming can't. wouldn‚Äôt consider ‚Äúhoarding‚Äù physically (ie order) doses required vaccinate population. I‚Äôm aware countries meet criteria. 

I‚Äôd say say 110% what‚Äôs needed (a little extra mistakes/vaccinating immigrants/etc) yea, responsible thing country help less fortunate countries out. frankly, considering working months pandemic, caught yet gotten immunity, probably fine waiting another month vaccine

This really get. restaurant retail employees working like since last spring. worked straight massive surge cases we're currently coming of. cases plummeting relative risk decreased lowest levels we've seen since last spring, they're suddenly extremely vocal wait March 28 eligible instead March 14.

We're gonna vaccinated within 3 months. relative risk exposed whenever eligible essential worker lower ever pandemic. let states manage vaccine rollout hopefully avoid completely unnecessary distribution bottlenecks. think there‚Äôs difference independent Western media writing (and questioning) approval process efficacy Russian vaccine Russian government‚Äôs concerted effort create spread misinformation Western vaccines.

Mainly intent. Opinions differ (every vaccine/disease different), 60-80% inoculated probably gets herd immunity semblance ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. seen enough saw biased face war. War places means children dying starvation disease, people tortured mutilated, women raped. means people leaving lives behind look safety. think pandemic big issue places like Syria Yemen? Would big issue know put table tomorrow? think hangup mRNA vaccines rather J&amp;J vaccine.
Moderna clumsily fed conspiracy fodder folks calling platform ‚ÄúOperating System‚Äù saying vaccine introduces ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù mRNA.
Then Gates main promoter. Extremely poor analogies choice spokesperson imo.
The hang ups mRNA vaccine emerging technology understandable imo. pretty rough trials ten years ago think it‚Äôs unfortunate many people assuming others don‚Äôt genuine concerns based research mRNA emerging tech ‚Äúemergency use‚Äù qualifier. People frivolously putting thoughts peoples‚Äô minds assume doesn‚Äôt want vaccine.
The Tuskegee angle makes stomach Wow amazing. list covered professions OK absolutely massive. Literally everyone know would qualify. J&amp;J seem shitty company

Errr, hate break you, they're big shitty companies, we're relying heavily moment.  TLDR: Social geographical pockets continued epidemic vaccine hesitance.

BTW: vaccines curb transmission reinfection lot better natural immunity, highly likely, hesitance becomes problem everyone outside pockets (not counting differences selection pressure). confidently wrong backwards actually funny read ""comebacks"". üòÇ response, üòî That's he's 65. Unemployed people 65 eligible march 24th. Yeah entire thing happened under, say, Clinton administration, Republican would willing take vaccine. Since initial rollout happened Trump hyped election, less partisan. proud American? 500k deaths? I'll take lockdowns every single time. Never again.  friend mine said got vaccine ER used work connections. hospitals really this? Giving vaccines people connections? wonder they're lying though remember vaccine had. bad cold waste tamiflue, flu high risk, could kept hospital. Calling means risk exposing patients flu, forcing someone drive safe drive. I‚Äôll say wedding years ago, 75% acceptance rate unexpectedly high (very crowded venue result). imagine less people vacationing now, think couple people friend group would go wedding weeks away mass immunity even mask. judging anyone does, saying probably risk averse would probably others like me. 

People show wear mask probably fall between, probably aware moderates dying breed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going rage Page dying light‚Äù
- Trey anti-vaxxers area posting social media people get vaccines fact given emergency approval means life insurance companies void policy taking unproven experimental drug deny beneficiary payout matter die age. sounds ridiculous gaining traction. many high risk people nervous vaccines say they'll ""wait see happens"" deciding get one not. meantime, state Covid mandates ending people ditching masks gathering crowds regular basis. ones hesitant vaccinate increased exposure risk. question anyone would kind know answer. Look model projection Brazil Covid cases death. noticed graph line goes March 27 starts drop. Would anyone know drops suddenly date continues think people back vengeance. Yeah problem getting drunk shit watching baseball Congrats! sadly probably can't get mine (only 18) soon can.

Do know brand getting? know don't? Govt screwed vaccine rollout number things sure. measuring stick mainly deaths per capita. excellent job first wave, mostly following science instead political, ideological responses US. feel much safer here. Ain't God damn truth. Conference Retroviruses Opportunistic Infections 2021:¬†Abstract SS777. Presented March 6, 2021. Sweden would done 4 days No. No, man. Shit, no, man. believe get ass kicked sayin' something like that, man. Lmao. Least country doesn‚Äôt take orders Merkel.  No, thats problem. would even better US vaccine facilities running already.

The problem see supply lines (for EU US) interconnected, quite likely Dutch facilities also part primary US-supply chain. surprise one bit US company J&amp;J, part Warp speed program put US supply first priority, EU second. might even contractually obliged so. 'wars'? Oh mean 'wars' iraq afghanistan american air strikes grind everything ground dust troops go in? Sorry see take guy seriously comparing dying elderly people 'real' war, maybe needs see genocide africa see difference. 100% that. 

I think anyone LIKES called stupid.. someone (or repeating) something that's blatantly on-the-face idiotic stupid.. I'm straight going call it. 

""correcting stupidity"" (at least opinion).. part social-contract community obligations. like seeing infection wound anything fix it. 

If (humans) want society improve advance get better futuristic.. critically important stamp ignorance stupidity (with, opinion, direct strong efforts possible). 

I really care people's feels get hurt .. stupid stupid. tap-dance around that. person want called stupid,. there's easy fix that:.. Stop stupid. actually believe maybe it‚Äôs time DNA overhaul. family bar business. expect biiiigg spike traffic herd immunity reached capacity restrictions lifted, things settle 2019 levels month two.

The people ""can go without"" going eat drinks people carried industry pre-COVID, needed succeed post-COVID. 95% protection, 100%, got account things like infected vaccinated actually goes effect. That‚Äôs roughly 2x percentage country population India vaccinated 2M... hope people realize much overweight affects health Great news! Getting first dose today. country lockdown like single day, lmao. Triggered little bong. absolutely coincidence number cycles pcr tests decreased 50% Biden elected. Sounds like comparing Florida California doesn‚Äôt make lot sense then. Imagine ignorant think US country, even pointed wrong are... double harder. Then, pointed still objectively wrong... move goal posts triple wrong.

Truly amazing stuff.

Its okay admit made mistake. world would better place people did. CDC's guidance infallible. CDC organization logistical expertise. things true yet irrelevant. Congratulations! Sure, nowhere near percentage, idiot politicians ever made ""no shirt, service"" political thing. Lmao. Trump literally plan distribution logistics Ok guess million vaccines given day milestone farce.

Dude don‚Äôt like guy admit good things. even hate acknowledge it. Least we‚Äôll lockdown long disastrous EU vaccine programme. impression vaccinated people still carry transmit virus

As much harder study efficacy, initial studies study this, scientists say anything ""we know vaccinated people transmit virus"". Unfortunately, somewhere along message chain you, ""we know if"" dropped gave wrong impression - never evidence could, evidence either. 

Now, general vaccines least limit transmission, that's works vaccines, expectation always, enough time passed [studies starting come showing It'll take peer-review health authorities adopt, pretty much guaranteed everyone conclude do. 

Be careful read news - ""we know if"" different ""we know that"". really minor disqualifies statement entirety.  Maybe people use words definition antagonistic it. like play *Plague*, New Zealand shut borders early prevented chance complete covid victory Mers little contagious even less original Sars 1. actually 3 million 2.5 million last days. It‚Äôs going accelerate. Exactly. Fucking thieves. EU really shown true colours here, they're skull crossbones. Pools summer activities closed pretty frequently grandparents growing up.

The average amount vaccines given past days 2 million US. super rare complication doesn‚Äôt Happen covid.

Normal good kids. Abnormal ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù stuff harmful kids. Many parents feel it‚Äôs harmful virus kids. CNN placeholder MSM. 

And yes, agree. Don‚Äôt panic. don‚Äôt listen fear mongering news networks... like cnn. like oann. like every news organization.

Fear mind killer. don‚Äôt panic. actually question things don‚Äôt make sense. 

Rather ‚Äúhave tolerance‚Äù questioning information. BMI terrible metric. People know bodies. instance I‚Äôm 20 lbs overweight according me. According BMI I‚Äôm 35 lbs overweight. I‚Äôve weight looked ill. read article recently this. spoke many people symptoms disappear first dose. narrative ‚Äúin heads.‚Äù absolute crap headline, sounds like fearmongering. better headline would something like ""A harmless Covid vaccine side effect, enlarged lymph nodes, mistaken cancer."" add word harmless, assure little education skimmed hastily vaccine cause cancer.

Oh well, I've seen worse headlines this. One time, CNBC published article vaccine anaphylaxis something like ""Allergic reactions prompt fear Covid vaccines,"" clicked article, rate severe reactions around 5 million.

If journalists want increase vaccine hesitancy, put facts, fears, headline. Unfortunately, almost articles written subject matter experts many written haste. cynical, one wonders driving traffic reason news outlets write headlines like this. Although, Hanlon's razor, ""never attribute malice adequately explained stupidity."" Yes work CCP, reddit comment section influential 10 layers CCP decided hire brainwash 5 you. 

And wrong I'm pro communist. communism capitalism utter Utopia ideologies. specific social environment support them.

Low enough general public health restrictions gutted people chucking masks long  believe every claim one foreign adversary makes another without evidence I‚Äôve got WMD‚Äôs Iraq sell you.

It‚Äôs also irrelevant even it. supposed that? lungs get scarred know it? Unfortunately UK variant poised become dominant twice contagious, thing far over. UK estimates needs vaccinate 2M people day stay ahead it. US twice size reached 2M yet. ""deliver"" anything, create doses, private company did. case doses question, created us. stole half going get already lot less ordered.

The real death count China much much higher reported number. people showing symptoms taken away back vehicles screaming... Officials giving money people collect ashes loved ones say anything...

So pro communist regimes saying... Indiana dropped 50 well. Ha!!! Thats good shit right there.... got second dose. Two weeks baby!!! Jackass fauci didnt science virus located.

The thing worked completely changing diet. Instead giant plate pizza rolls lunch, salad. Instead Ramen noodles breakfast, I‚Äôll green smoothie. 

The best thing eat much want now. used fail diets ate less normally ate always felt hungry. Now, eat much fucking salad want really isn‚Äôt going put weight me. I‚Äôm never hungry eat lot low calorie nutritious food. fills up. keeps straying far diet kills cravings. Ok like, cheap mobile game. literally free download. want make realistic? Looks like main problem lot people want consider BMI 30 obese. Touched nerves apparently. Couldn‚Äôt defer time instead Well that‚Äôs way manipulate it.

Still waiting open article.   Very, cold weather good mitigation transmission. keeps people inside, even go meet friends socialize anywhere cold. 

Its mildly cold weather, like 30-50f, worst transmission. People still go parties bars social events, cold enough indoors instead outside. 

This also applies hot weather. 65-85f good mitigating transmission, people socialize outdoors far indoors. hotter go, people go indoors want air conditioning. Hence much south summer. Bobby Hill method. little misleading avg daily deaths still 1500. first dip 1000 mark... Strange never funny though problem.

It's like every time someone talks Trump GOP asks obvious rhetorical questions acts like profound. know answers, either care, morons assholes. appointments booked, 24x7 appointments available.

We treat such.

These rapid antigen tests perform home, sample mail back lab. Read article title. absolutely right number reasons. First foremost overlap getting stragglers group drags process far long.

These models also built around numbers real world numbers. everyone priory group wants vaccine. point holding process people never accept vaccine first place. There‚Äôs lot furloughed workers really need this. It‚Äôs awful weren‚Äôt able better support them, better alternative. Where'd see that? Per New York Times we're 18.5% *at least* one dose, including J&amp;J. 

Another 8.6% fully vaccinated, understand numbers can't add number. That‚Äôs figured wasn‚Äôt sure OP saying. Thanks clarifying!  makes sense. Thank you! point I‚Äôm anything opens door people getting vaccines.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* death! huge increase Missouri's reported case numbers yesterday \~80,000. CDC post explanation I'm assuming may probable cases added official count. Missouri's dashboard also huge increase explanation recent changes knows lol.  prob Oh bad, totally ignored CA part. even see it. Weird. Medical workers 1A, along 65+ health conditions.

1B includes grocery store workers, manufacturing, logistics, education childcare workers, front-facing government employees, agricultural workers. weird scientist US ... I'm moving goalposts, I'm saying regardless stated website, governor advancing phases. even green across board, it'll still depend governor. I'm going agree disagree that's shakes guess. great day. dad BMI higher 25 high blood pressure? type job work works? story times ten million. cool hear ""in person"". wild. People know, went schools, way. ""I'm gonna wait people get it"", ""Its soon, ""I'm anti-vax think need one""...its crazy.

I still friends refuse wear masks too. ""I'm healthy, worry it."" zero compassion worry potentially killing family friends. J&amp;J vaccine confers immunity upon lot faster Moderna Pfizer vaccine.  two weeks, start protection one shot, we‚Äôve seen clinical trials. Whereas Pfizer takes four weeks Moderna takes six weeks.

Is actually correct though? Moderna include data trial showed 80+% efficacy 14 days \[0\], also seen pfizer practice Israel vaccine rollout ""Two weeks ago, researchers Israel reported one dose Pfizer vaccine 85% effective preventing symptomatic disease 15 28 days inoculation.""\[1\]. less I'm wrong, data seems imply feel least good protected 14 days first moderna pfizer vaccine dose J&amp;J. Sure need second shot either ensure efficacy lasts - seems wrong say starts later.

\[0\]  Actually, spite Trump, medical community scraped roughest part.

.

Trump threw stumbling blocks way whole time office. OP literally functioning.  7M delivered today  Wonderful! efforts current national leadership incredible. Working side side state partners, rather playing cheap games, getting us well way opening back 100% coast coast. Good news around. link near-real-time numbers? I'd love bookmark it.  Agreed vaccines produced year better closer get ensuring theres enough vaccines everyone.  distressingly true. know topic, since mentioned CDC site‚Äôs updates, would happen seen anything reported new cases yesterday jumped outrageously high according them? John‚Äôs Hopkins 44000 CDC added way 100000. crazy backlog something? CA 27.65 % population one doses (excluding J&amp;J) since December daily injection average still climbing week week, I'd say estimates eligible 16 + year old citizens nation least started vaccination process end May realistic well...yeah probably. issue infections, issue many hospitalisations are, hopefully vaccines reduce country prevented virus entirely entering spreading, seen small numbers. point massive differences different countries dealt problem US clearly one countries handle well. right many European countries bad even worse US. I'm Czech Republic, fact much worse. People Europe criticize governments lot handling coronavirus. 

Even Europe countries much better others. Czech Republic 2,000 per million died, Germany 800 Finland 130. US 1,500 quite bad, worst. whole Taiwan (which 23 million population) 10 people died. 

Regarding coronavirus, Trump deserves lot criticism. opinion main reason US end even worse lot responsibilities state governments, Trump believe US would fare much worse. that. 9/11 excuse rev MIC funnel billions dollars right pockets. 

Can't really letting people stay safely home. Yeah bro U.K. severe lockdown largely still place. problem people don‚Äôt care anymore whatever want anyway.

Vaccines protect nearly everyone significant risk death rising case numbers aren‚Äôt problem September. really matter, though? fewer people getting second doses, open slots first doses? Sad truth: level mis-information high, even sub. ain't citizens. least US anyone living country get dose. Citizenship even permanent residency requirements. accusations nationalism really fitting case. Seeing people know adamantly opposed people going bars dining indoors since April (as week) giddily sharing social media stories insides favorite bars restaurants. I‚Äôve seeing people haven‚Äôt seen half year who‚Äôve ultra vigilant they‚Äôre either vaccinated soon talking much look forward spring summer parties. thing isn‚Äôt going bang it‚Äôs gonna get quieter quieter ‚Äúsemblance‚Äù (ha, see there) alarmist news articles. Oh cool, let go attic see find medical degree. Something enough people take consideration financial impact pandemic. lost year fun buds. 

For millions people, take long time financially recover. Think folks behind rent mortgage, who've laid off, cut savings, cashed stocks, sold property survive.

Speaking myself, anticipate it'll take 3+ years really recover economic impact pandemic. 1.6 million number doses administered across entire US last 24 hours, I'm talking California's numbers. Awesome! Successfully prioritized people need also making sure others find around COVID risks also taken care of. Walking talking time, love see it! got it, ty I'm assuming equal restrictions everyone makes sense. concede perfect multiplying 100 calories 2.5 servings something everyone capable of. Anyone else get vaccinated plan get vaccinated keep secret anti-vaxxers lives? I‚Äôll ‚Äúshopping‚Äù get mine.  Numbers always day two behind, Monday Tuesday always worst reporting days, Saturday Sunday worst vaccination days. say impossible, unlikely caught anything him. I'd say that'd true even without vaccinated - 15 feet away masked easy transmission opportunity, say least. 

But especially substantial protection (even full quite yet) vaccine - likely totally fine. still vaccinating 65+, notion they‚Äôre going get around people age.

California opened 1B essential workers quite ago. What's adult pop Israel since can't vaccinate kids anyway. Better way would many adults Israel received first dose logistics would nightmare. FDA even approve non-mail-in kit past December. imagine even half US population trying mail back swabs labs. would inundate postal service, ripped &amp; torn packages would pose constant bio-hazard threat. better way would've CDC partner big grocery store/retail chains require mandatory weekly testing employees, way many universities require on-campus staff &amp; students. perfect humane world would apply entire food distribution system, farms distributors shippers, could never happen US non-union decentralization, use under-the-table illegal immigrant laborers. go. 208 deaths Covid-19 36203 total deaths (0.57% deaths age group) vs 178 flu deaths number (0.49% deaths age group) flu 0-17 age group 2020. difference numbers statistically insignificant. flu numbers vaccination. trying right patronize you- looking Covid outsized risk son. I've cautious Covid day 1 grandmother live with, children really risk this. Well currently prioritizing gets limited vaccines need most. US currently world's biggest case load, highest number recorded deaths, mention world-leading obesity co-morbidity rates.

Seems like makes sense ""hoard"" (aka utilize vaccines funded manufactured) get situation control. HIV retrovirus clever ways hiding (and directly destroying) immune cells. Different beast.  polarized ends represent majority politically independent America. people love Joe Biden get 5,600 family cure lethal pandemic. George W Bush's approval rating September 12th goddamn people happy. large number people trouble processing 330 million.

500,000 dead coronavirus 1-in-660 chance dying COVID since start pandemic year ago. comparison, typical death rate America 8.977/1000, 1-in-111, rising regardless coronavirus. lastly, every Coronavirus death excess death. like Americans 1-in-660 chance dying COVID addition 1-in-111 overall chance dying. Plus response coronavirus, evidence suggesting diabetes, alzheimers, traffic deaths, homicides, overdoses well. latter 3 representing much real risk young people coronavirus.

This really touchy topic here, attempt tell people realistic risk COVID automatically interpreted downplaying severity virus cheering deaths grandmas. I'm trying downplay severity virus, wish people would realistic assessing risk instead hearing big numbers yelling. Tiered rollout. Probably meant can‚Äôt get one moment. I‚Äôm California I‚Äôll likely waiting April, around corner. exact conversation sister 2 weeks go. really smart said thought caused cancer trust made quickly. said vaccine research years happened different strains corona. even skip beat responded ""yeah, research evidence shown knowledge &amp; research corona strains around 20 years"". said 20 year time frame plenty time research mRna eventually vaccine purposes. sort changed tune bit heard said.

She stubborn though still refuses get vaccine. Oh well lol. no-longer sore arm also likes this. slow. states using less 80% supply despite supply go big time. counties pissed supply shortage. Major healthcare chains also cancelling 2nd dose appointment allocation gone despite state supply going up. Governers like Newsom trying extract political mileage rather operating way maximum doses used next set folks vaccinated. narrowing scope trying go certain communities, vaccination trail supply major way. entirely plausible case, higher death ratio compared cases could attributed high amount seniors state. kids never take entire grade school online. That‚Äôs many kids struggling academically mentally. high school started hybrid learning last week whole year online. able focus work much better person environment. Kids seriously cannot afford lose another year school. saying it‚Äôs possible cases go simply inaccurate

Who said feel comfortable see massive spike but, rather, small-to-medium spike, keep vaccinating, vaccinating, vaccinating. Ok fair. live together dependent. Always strange US country huge extremes.

Here UK schools time none theatre kids holding onto ropes etc. masks elementary level either. Sadly, there's shortage people intimately familiar particular brand care. I'm lucky enough position need anymore. would‚Äôve thought problem. really appreciate sharing article subreddit! looking something similar without luck. I‚Äôm signed really excited prospect getting vaccinated little faster. Yes, website links providers vaccine, Local Health Department already listed weeks ago. visited every website list, appointments available within 50 miles location. hate needles I'll say barely felt moderna one. Less painful papercut fwiw.  Yep. actually. kill you, get life. Definitely interesting. Makes one wonder accusations regarding manipulation case counts true! sure could happen, that's fairly glaring discrepancy. want better ones see jj one inferior. Stinks human nature  saw 10million 2 million delivered last week days deliveries. paying close attention entire week. 


Anyway need 14 mill week sustain 2 million day. 28mil week reach 140 million 5 weeks (a stated delivery schedule read article late February) say expect more. absolutely better at. showed mine, yours? 

Oh fun one world big people stupid. stupid person twitter represent much. Yup. Imagine someone said thank goodness three jumbo jets crash daily. ‚ÄúSmell ya later! Except can‚Äôt, gave fucking Covid.‚Äù

(My sense smell damaged 5 months; I‚Äôm fully allowed make joke.) states cities outright ignored half-baked ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù weeks ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù

The key misunderstanding planning point view non-uniform lock waste time. looks like didn‚Äôt expect half country would revolt weeks/months/years order wear masks

It never meant remove Covid country, slow rate. slowed rate, fewer people would die overall. 

Italy better job locking US, although experiencing new waves like everyone else, base exposure significantly lower, leading lower peaks.  nothing media exploit fear monger? .... certain vaccines required number places quite long time. always carry around Yellow Card (yellow fever vaccine proof), keep passport international drivers license. great news! start days states zero deaths. Days counties report new cases Covid. states, counties. 

Keep pushing vaccinations. Keep utilizing face masks. Warmer humid weather also drive cases. spring perfect storm virus hit many different angles.  Haha, live adult life. don‚Äôt hang around bars much, need wait around restaurants eat.

I acted like college. offense 40, married 40, bars like don‚Äôt hold much appeal. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è combination public/private key + blockchain could relatively quickly implemented ensure anonymity. course ship kind sailed that. used past year think things. Personally I'm hoping able go PAX East June conventions throughout rest year. Biden able meet ambition enough doses every adult May, think there's understandable safety concerns around packed conventions like virus began spreading. decision take take booster shot affect Bidens decision donate donate shots countries, matter. Thanks. posted it. H1N1 100 million cases America. That's entirely possible remember elementary school used body people. Kids would gone weeks. dad got really bad luckily school pulled us ""flu shot assembly"". school nurse gave kids flu shots good initiative. Chicago opened United Center mass vaccine spot. local pharmacies still don‚Äôt extras end night, nothings going waste far seems I've never seen before, sounds pretty good. deaths per capita right middle pack largest senior population state. prioritized vaccinating protecting seniors. 17.7% least one dose. Bottom half country far middle. I'd like know allow indoor dining.

If restaurant requires mask fine indoor dining, sense would make nonsense. actually welcoming vaccine passports? Yup, believe John Oliver Adam Conover bit easy published ‚ÄúScientific Report‚Äù even outcome clearly bullshit/not replicated science/etc knew people go outside might healthier overall anyways someone stays in? Especially much obesity increases risk serious Covid Facebook feed 

I see fucked Saying vaccine verification system pre-suppose needs hold identifying information tied individual. Lots ways skin cat. One thing see much people proposing Johnson Johnson vaccine allocated specific group people includes themselves. lot problem distribution arm varies county. right NC hard get appointments wake easier drive hour out. looks like greensboro raleigh setting mass vaccination clinics help lot. Yeah, registered well.

They're apparently opening 1c week. moderate case asthma, can't tell CA COVID site still qualifies (if so) I'd need schedule appointment.

I'm sure we'll blow folks pretty quickly too, course, patient much harder end sight. death rate higher case rate suggests be, could indication cases underreported one reason another(people refusing get tested, etc)  get that. I'm HUGE privacy nut actually. said, could implemented fashion preserves privacy. example:

If issuing pharmacy gives individual unique public key form QR code confirms individual received vaccine...then identifying info would needed. vaccination sites ask proof employment? That's works.

You make covid go away ""hardcore lockdown"". simply come back afterwards. Macedonia number going get even bigger next month. many 400 million J&amp;J keeps 100 million April target.

Let's it. Pfizer Moderna banging doses like crazy (14 million combined week). know minimum 200 million mRNA doses end next month.
 
Lets go. Administer doses like crazy clean stragglers end next month.  guess point they‚Äôd probably importing low number cases relative existing situation. I‚Äôm sure would make sort real dent covid numbers. 100 people covid coming country 2 weeks going materially change situation country reporting 1000 cases day (and probably since hear testing poor there)?

Edit: yes, policy specifics tricky. don‚Äôt know could find way open ticket holders gets removed think CDC owes general public, congress, state legislatures get date information possible. know, could two million (or less) people vaccinated reported. state legislature supposed know open indoor dining 100% numbers week old? Every day critical collective well-being, general economy. NYC opened indoor dining 100%, would result massive influx tax revenue. Doesn‚Äôt seem critical? good them, hope get vaccines struggling countries Interesting see big numbers largely preventable deaths keep happening Florida removed restrictions. big state expect big numbers, positivity rate high. Must mean people needing protection getting need state government. Ah, speak wisdom someone also navigated shitty waters VA. also wondered this.

I vaccinated mid January given CDC card date lot number Moderna vaccine. 

When returned photograph picture lot number told fill information CDC card myself. understand done would taken long time workers fill information although fomite transmission thought much issue, would imagine still wanted minimize exchanging stuff especially since workers would handling cards would exposed potentially exposing many people - excess abundance caution.

I imagine record somewhere since produce Medicare card well ID got shots hardly seamless process. favor ""green passports"" would enable people access stuff vaccinated. never understand people want restrictions, want vaccines. Oh sod off. Jesus can‚Äôt take good news California also came plan volunteer vaccination sites completing 4 hour shift eligible vaccination long supervisor says it‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôve looking haven‚Äôt found sites near me, I‚Äôm guessing soon start getting Johnson Johnson vaccine quantity start mass vaccination sites need people help. oh see, plan get Pfizer turn 16 June, think expecting approve vaccines teens children September October 2021 guess upload image card it. larger pharmacies like CVS might expose API airlines. magic discovering internets various QoL improvements 2021, aha.

 Japan's top official technology someone *never used* computer, quoting (paraphrasing) feel would impact job all? Catch spending $20 two crummy beers Here's anecdote. live Indiana far Ohio border. wife pregnant eligible Ohio Indiana. desperate get vaccinated signed get vaccinated Ohio yesterday Kroger. rural location pretty much every time slot available one day notice feel like taking shot away Ohio resident. also read Ohio said would vaccinate residents states. showed Kroger refused vaccinate Indiana ID. I'm certain end throwing away doses location. online virtual schools decades, long pandemic. great news. I'm waiting even get vaccine. I'm 31 btw. KY giving elderly first idea get mine Hate break you, neither delivered amount stated would. school work requires test twice week, symptoms either infection. publications literally required put negative spin everything. problem I‚Äôm mosh pit injuries  DeSantis total failure. j&amp;j forced make moderna pfizer?

They inferior product. absolutely agree. county Saturday appointments 10am 4:45 pm think that‚Äôs still restrictive. open least 12hours day? want majority Americans vaccinated go back normal, continually vaccinating next months. think counties Arizona open almost 24/7. Sydney, Australia completely normal 40 days 0 community transmission. think America goes back normal community transmission vaccination rate we'd hit herd immunity think 2 months now. think almost every American gets vaccinated medical religious holdouts vaccinated regardless. No, real symptoms either infection. I'm testing required school work at. fooling anybody! must live v sheltered life Downtown Disney (mostly) open, also part California Adventure open dining shopping rides. hypothesising hypothesis. That's fine academic purposes, way justification maintaining current harmful restrictions children development. Everyone country everyone world?

I feel take unnecessary vaccines extra supply donated countries. point simply don‚Äôt know case. know cases variant rising completely independent decline overall cases.  point graphs intersect, may not. simply don‚Äôt know, saying it‚Äôs possible cases go simply inaccurate clearly going right look cases variants. reach maximum immunity 7-14 days second dose, exactly 14.

Even that, already good immunity even maximum.

Top distancing masks, I'd willing bet good money long odds fine. OP, reason can't get one age. I'm young.

Hoping guidelines change next days.  can't guarantee anything, pretty good idea next 3 months gonna look like nothing extremely unexpected happens. totally fine lay plan change plan something dramatic happens like major vaccine disruption mutation.

Refusing lay plan speculative risk mutation popping reasonable approach. Texas? AKA suck follow orders get screamed public. dying

I'm also concerned long-term health consequences. even everyone else home vaccinated, could still catch him. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

We give delicious poutine Maple syrup :)  100% competing needs here, mask mandates preventing people working. ""New cases"" mean used to. vaccinations heavily skewed towards people likely die infected. American vaccination efforts dramatically reduced probability new case resulting death. Hospitalization reductions important right now, they're also happening.

In Texas clearly due weather. Please sign cancellation lists clinics! That's got mine I'm disabled caregivers need come several times week still leave house doctors appointments. high risk essential workers also vaccinated, still weeks away opportunity get vaccine.

I'm saying everyone needs stay locked away homes plenty states lifting mask restrictions prematurely. almost there, 3 months wearing masks huge ask protect essential workers vulnerable. college generally freedom adult (no need ask parents permission, sneak around want party, able drink, smoke, stay night, eat whatever want, whatever want, go wherever want etc) responsibilities child (go school, pass classes, maybe work part time local cafe).

Sadly, describe almost anything last year phase... gonna crazy see packed stadiums concerts sports states California still trying defend ban indoor dining. Thanks much, appreciate it!  they'll say hoax. 45 aka boss told say that

Fauci didnt listen politicans

Hmmm... pick one. Either told like good little pawn understand basic facts like cruise ships well known spreading diseases.

Pick. One. Agreed points.

Let's honest consistent messaging, even short-term negative consequences. Sample size ten?! üòÇüòÇüòÇ That's good hear weeks couple months left expect compliance, regardless case vaccination rates.

The vaccine made lot people little patient. people decided summer 2021 gonna 100% back normal regardless government COVID do. new mutation appeared rendered vaccines completely useless, still think would stop reopening. Tell wife!! :) mRNA vaccines easy make, paper.

I think high-risk individuals fine they're vaccinated, though maybe attend rave mostly unvaccinated population something.  Exhibit A, ladies gentlemen. They'll get decent mileage ""do feel safe back large crowds?"" ""do miss wearing mask...will wear cold flu season"" ""did ever think see event like again?"" get old couple weeks.

Sure places could require vaccination services legally can't require country everyone vaccinated. think we're definitely phase pandemic restrictions removed, added. Politicians drag feet comes easing restrictions, nothing universe could convince people re-implement restrictions.

His point correct, significant reduction. However real world seen mRNA vaccines highly effective. shows two things: 

-The T-Cell response important 

-E484K variants give shits someone‚Äôs previous infection infection fatality rate 0.5%, means someone BMI 30-34 IFR 0.54%? best effort dude particular person referenced cnn fashion led believe believed cnn guilty hiding vaccine problems. don‚Äôt watch cnn Fox obviously biased talking head show ilk, breed kind sentiment. Anyone believes unquestionably programs offer simply fool. agenda, subtle others. 90% everything bull, enlightenment finding remaining 10% truth media. Thank input! believe that‚Äôs oncologist conclude well. Continue exercise caution around non-vaccinated individuals. probably mask around even vaccinated individuals extra precaution, definitely feel comfortable seeing person.  Moderna zero side effects either shot. i'm old, allegedly better 50 y/o's. need work, enjoy lives.

People work enjoy lives also following public safety guidelines. wear fucking mask stay 2 meters away strangers. fine. exactly gitmo. people want stay locked so

The people risk *have* stay locked up, selfish think people. keep following basic health recommendations all, including risk, live relatively normal lives back full normal near future. people like start ignoring rules can't live without rave months people *forced* give normal even longer, worse, die.  I'd bet no-needle vaccine much less resistance people avoiding current vaccine ""worried genetic technology"". one point suggest 20x piece heritage Oh, mean crush epidemiological hopes. political hopes firmly crushed. Sounds like they‚Äôre officially acknowledging vaccines work. fantastic news! affected Unfortunately time another country's late. Actually lot data previously infected well younger get severe side effects. Goes show many people dont ability dose federally illegal drugs without consequence punishment system. Yet people told inject themself unknown substance placebo effect. so? likley hit 100 million administered doses week. certainly hope so!!! Anyone projecting 3-4 months advance making shit up, I'd feel comfortable college back normal 2022. Completely agree! I‚Äôll definitely asking oncology team specifically means me, I‚Äôm curious overall guidelines would general high risk individuals. I‚Äôll probably continue overly cautious till treatment finished (which fortunately soon). Exactly that, yes. I'm halfway fully vaccinated today!! I'm **excited!** red herring!!!! Yeah know somebody whose BMI 29.9 rising - obese soon enough. Dude abs. Absolute beast, he's world-class athlete. works arse gym. turnaround basically nothing change presidency. mom worked building geriatric dentistry office. result, multiple occasions, office accidentally became drive thru.

Also dad wait line drive thru either. per CDC guidelines, safe fully vaccinated person visit someone low risk, Covid perspective babies low risk. see kid without precautions. college finally got back us whether they're person fall. far gonna bit 50% classes in-person, pisses off. suffer home ANOTHER semester I'm dropping out, joke. Hopefully, people get vaccinated they'll number, point, I'm expecting bad news considering reckless people are. says ""birth rates California fell 10.2% Dec. 2019 Dec. 2020"", says nothing month December alone. Might missing something since I'm reading mobile version though. spring break cities going really bad bet. surprised new strains mutated them.

South Padre, Galveston, etc. memorial day really even issue. even really steal us. We're going making enough vaccinate Australian population, surplus donated small South Pacific island nations. really they're stealing them. Really classy, EU. Say what? That's rather disingenuous guess late June. general public able get vaccine April, I'm assuming gonna hard people get slot. Remember eradicated smallpox polio vaccine rollout national restrictions? remember. dont really cook, long term plan. remember going store interesting see left people panic bought. think anyone assure anything 9 months now, things improving rapidly california right now. little protection first two weeks, ramps also 2nd shot

Moderna presentation 26 2nd doses. I‚Äôm pretty sure COVID April (no test available close contact got sick two weeks later...) symptoms first dose Moderna, people already COVID usually reaction second dose well? Thanks! suppose right. talk eligible becomes increasingly moot vaccine supply ramping quickly. don‚Äôt love Trump republican disapprove Newsom‚Äôs performance. fallen love science behind mRNA vaccines. 3S printing inside body. Get rekt stupid coronavirus still lab work pseudoviruses, typically produces lower titers. can't directly extrapolate much immunity wanes humans actual wild variants. yet sore arm welcomes this. think ur blinded hate. accurate that's reporting 16 states months 1000. precise, accurate. got really lucky 2009 couple ways - contagious (since people little immunity it) lethal, older people who'd around last H1N1 virus remaining immunity. Could lot worse. Canadian here, we'll take 'em. 

No seriously agree you, vaccine sitting shelf completely immoral right now. Lower eligibility age 10 years think need to, get faster giving millions vaccine fewer people right age. CDC still requires test re-enter country, doesn‚Äôt matter you‚Äôve vaccinated. reason alone won‚Äôt waste time traveling. right (hopefully won't), lot magic internet points. not, erases account...   You‚Äôre buffoon Lmao ‚Äúthis wont impacting ‚ÄúfreeDUMBS‚Äù. god people something else deaths shooting COVID BMI perfect measurement measurement meaning respect COVID risk. Yeah, definitely dropped ball. keep trying elsewhere tho, keep tips mind.  never flu shot life, 23 got flu. I've gotten flu shot every year since. Got first Pfizer dose yesterday. Shoulder feels like slept wrong emotional state vastly improved. parents brother got vaccinated recently well. never grateful. Thank science. mean else think would happen.

Look title. conclusion think majority people going jump reading that?

This article spreading death rate. telling fucking story. We're guinea pigs here. Nobody said that, current vaccines seem prevent death know problem waiting one get approved kids trials already happening. Pretty selfish adults like fuck got ours. think need try convince get eventually, short term agree foolish waste time them. ‚ÄúSafe‚Äù? 1,400 deaths vaccine. CDC website source get flagged also think there's really weird misunderstanding people comes efficacy. I've seen people say they're gonna take 65% effective J&amp;J vaccine ""that means 35% chance catching COVID still"", they'll say something like ""even get Pfizer vaccine, there's still 5% chance catch COVID"". That's... works. like people gotten COVID vaccine, 0% ""vaccine protection"" past year, certainly mean 100% chance catching virus (as obviously evidenced fact people caught yet). get J&amp;J vaccine, chances never getting COVID much higher 65%, again, almost certainly die hospitalized loving positive headlines lately. NYC, oh, we've got it. 24/7 mass vax sites, we've got it. Full appointments, we've got it!

Hot chocolate! Skinny people get COVID end ventilators too. 1.6 million INCLUDING J&amp;J?


ouch brutally slow. need better love us. like this, elegant solution Ummm would like word you; injected along daily snort well. think eligible pool needs encouragement right now, think need ability easily schedule appointment. swear feels like I'd easier time getting RTX 3080 vaccine dad. Right, often forget map territory. like Trump said, it'll warm gone April! Grats mom! OK full compliment mutations accurate enough? Would worthwhile test properly secure facility? recall reading mutations behave differently depending mutations present. states like TX MS FL opening everything abandoning mask mandates, go back time.

J&amp;J, Moderna Pfizer really need invent vaccine stupidity need billion doses starters.  Muscles atrophied. RBF life üôå Let's say hear barrage conspiracy theories every night want get caught crossfire. hope light coming train ..... see lol Yeah. I'm giving vaccines whoever get them, elderly 75+ family signed every location shot, yet opened 50+, half senior population even one shot yet, that's problem.

I worry much restrictions still place, lifted next couple weeks here. AZ eroded trust much read ""under stress"" understand ""30% order less""... stupid person twitter represent much

Normally would agree, stupid person VICE writer got 55k likes saying something stupid. really care 30% population take it. Lets see long last Congratulations! get 2nd dose Thursday. Anxiously excited, hoping minimal reaction anything Yeah caught boss mins ago told I'm taking rest week off. put back work 14th... got first dose 1st, reports I've seen indicate 90ish% efficacy around 14-15 days first dose, think 90ish% + masks level protection I'm reasonably comfortable with. doesn‚Äôt make sense statistically. supply increasing second fixed portion prior supply would increasing portion current allocation? got it, care. WA Indeed. Facebook feed filled people posting vaccination cards days, anything. ever saw antivax Covid denial stuff I‚Äôd immediately hide/unfriend.

And hope sure situation gets commotion possible, need Uh... isn‚Äôt SW Florida generally pretty rich white? Especially compared way diverse Miami metro. Someone correct thinking wrong this. here's see it: 

If CDC begrudgingly admits safe vaccinated people hang unvaccinated people (with masks distancing), essentially put whole ""We know vaccine prevents transmission yet"" narrative? feel like even *slight* possibility transmission vaccinated, CDC would cover ass maintain ""We know yet"" bit, safe side. 

And organization cautious CDC says something safe, indeed very, safe. Sounds like casting [Wrath Iowa little 2 million people compared Texas 28 million.

Well considering contagious COVID is, plan vaccinate pretty much everybody.

So choice throwing vaccine out, vaccinating body, vaccinate. people infected means chances mutate EU already delivered thousands doses despite shortchanged AZ, also much worse situation Australia right now. Might well blame AZ overpromising. hope look happened states, happened countries took swift drastic action. ""lost year"" people arsed wear fucking mask, they'd rather risk health others going bars, etc. Thanks bunch! I'll check out. Lmao act like countries sending US vaccines.

Theyre manufactured directly US ofc make enough quickly doubt Texas gets bad. 

Iowa removed mask mandate 2/10 3,300 cases. 

Yesterday 354 Thanks much! take logic bit farther.... soon every high risk person gotten vaccinated want to. effectively ends restrictions Since mRNA vaccine relatively new thing comparing others, production requires different material sourcing, formulation, etc.

Derek Lowe wrote interesting piece Weird comparison. That's like saying America people eating salad heart surgeries. really mean anything.

Like, literally. Basic statistic means massive testing cover asymptomatic ones too, trace went contact with. Knowing exactly case acquired. Thus illustrating detailed line events know sure nobody else contracted virus. 

Those numbers website merely result happened. Granted useful figuring happened fact, lots means prevent spreads preventatively. 

There 29mil confirmed cases US right now. Even assume person came contact 10 human beings infectious period. That's almost 90% US population. simply impossible figure came contact talking numbers big, that's assuming everyone willing tell truth. point, might well contact tracing save money educate public. Florida though? That's closer comparison Texas Iowa Yeah, humans really good it, thanks demonstration bars restaurants West Yellowstone Gardiner. definitely respect moral thought process appreciate it. hard know would happen turned opportunity get vaccinated though, I'd encourage go ahead contact ask. they're able tell they'll sure use doses they'll go people working public, please feel moral dilemma signing up. reaching point bottleneck demand, means people sign up, better everyone is.

Exact number need get lift restrictions? This. nobody acknowledge this. people burning masks ones recklessly go get infected everyone close infected. like they‚Äôre still contributing herd immunity. Keep head up. record vaccinations, end covid getting closer closer! summer, seeing majority even total removal lockdown restrictions. feel I've already gone I'm going add another point, EU use doses got taking nations. embarrassing, talk throwing weight around. thought EU meant forward thinking bloc nations, instead practicing vaccine nationalisation.

I can‚Äôt personally imagine rightfully frightened COVID wanting return normal life, avoiding surest fix issues. people are, indeed, complicated.  UK never did, simply bought doses country's facilities capacity produce, zero government invested billions ensure capacity start producing vaccines exchange deal. EU could done this, didn't, insisted ""open business"" pandemic criticised UK US ""vaccine nationalism"" that, international countries like us placed orders expecting able receive them. they've stolen shipment destined us, going back word fucking everyone placed order outside EU. reason selfish half gym go wear them?

Honestly kinda makes sense strict it. turn somebody away vaccine site, you‚Äôll still burnt appointment slot end unused dose end day, that‚Äôs going end going rando expiring dose list likely ineligible.

Doses new, one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine arriving Arizona, leaving many Arizonans asking get one two-shot Pfizer Moderna vaccines.

The answer, health officials say, get whichever available become eligible, protect severe outcomes.

Some people sure still preferences based convenience, health even religious reasons, three available vaccines slightly different.

But good news researchers say three effective vaccines prevent hospitalizations deaths COVID-19.

Basically, genome houses thousands genes long-term storage system. genomes exist (almost) every cell identical each. However, information stored genome useless own. great number functional genes genome contain code make proteins. order get information making protein genome ribosomes (where proteins synthesized), cells make temporary copy genetic information mobile form called messenger RNA (mRNA). 


mRNA unstable last long best circumstances, cells produce additional molecules break down, make sure linger around longer they're needed. mRNA enough time get ribosome genetic code translated functional protein.  


In case mRNA vaccines, like ones made Pfizer Moderna, use mRNA codes so-called spike proteins exist exterior COVID-19 virus. spike proteins get recognized immune system, produces antibodies bind mark destruction. However, spike proteins harmless own.

So, vaccine delivery system body make boatloads COVID-19 spike proteins based mRNA, teaching immune system fight virus. mRNA degraded cell.

I'm one people. waiting refund stimulus put groceries cc again. stop hyperbole. like 10 states never mask mandate.  private enterprises free mandate whatever mask rules please. anyone mask 2 months ago subsequently changed mindset face onslaught positive news.

its time move forward also acknowledging horrible pandemic was. certain states relax restrictions sooner others, salud, thats way works - US 50 individual countries one umbrella.

Personal risk assessment, personal responsibility. thats stage nothing going change that. That‚Äôs fucking great. shitty little state (Delaware) isn‚Äôt even offering vaccine people high risk conditions yet, today blamed winter storms weeks ago still large number unused doses. really starting feel like pandemic disaster movie, wouldn‚Äôt managed sneak way onto one secret government life boats asteroid hits. get looking numbers. 3 million day happen week continue rise. doses scheduled get even outpace 3 million day average closer 5. use 3 million, that‚Äôs 180 million addition 95 million we‚Äôve already done. That‚Äôs 275 million around 40 million 1 dose J&amp;J. That‚Äôs around 150 million people low end nearly 75% adult population. 20-30% easily choose get first all. everyone access end April. think estimates skew conservative. Pretty much reckless people circle gone FL least far. record also proven pretty good catching Covid. makes sense.

On positive note, experts millions participants track around world. gaining data lot easier hopefully speed process gain FDA Approval. Went Sunday going Friday cabbage patch. 60s, fairly 

Sorry, comment really funny almost one big change made country sane again. clinical studies support use bryonia prophylactic COVID-19 compare peer reviewed RCT's tens thousands participants approved vaccines? experience California:

(1) State notification system bit mess. terrible given sheer scale distribution, could tightened up. educator, hence Tier 1B State, eligible since 2 weeks ago, appointments never available county quite recently, backlog demand Tier 1A recipients. registered notifications state website, Kaiser (my insurer). found, somewhat accident, complete e-visit Kaiser site move scheduling tier. Lo behold, yesterday get email I'm eligible go in, day everything. Still heard back .gov notification site, moot point.

(2) went big temporary clinic business expo, things ran pretty smoothly. 60 stations administering vaccines (I got Moderna), verify insurance card driver's license. proof employment educator needed, maybe insurer's records, maybe ultimately honor system, sure. think waited 5-10 minutes got poked, chill 15 minutes case allergic reaction. problems, drove home.

(3) Night getting vaccine today, definitely shoulder soreness muscle around injection site. happens time flu shots, etc, biggie, maybe little stronger, bad. sore back well, since I'm side sleeper, I'm wondering sleep right comfortably roll onto left shoulder. far side/after-effects go, seems pretty mild. mental relief definitely worth it, keen get COVID. feel confident I'll able travel couple months. think makes sense business keep people payroll? might make sense it‚Äôs specialized position, lets honest, people replaceable. Sorry news you. mask quarantine. would definitely carry junk around year travel freely. that, I'd expect means nothing ignored. One day, trend make. thought may national mask mandate him, know politics much whether could that. \*Cries Japan\* matters? Moderate COVID walk park either permanent (as far know) consequences. appreciate avoiding mortality important good endpoint, I'm worried we're overselling effects gloss spectrum disease. Considering reports pharmacies throwing expired vaccines? Yes. state eligible July unless things change amount available. India vaccinating faster (on trailing 7d- basis) EU US vaccinated around 1.6-1.7 million yesterday - unless data changes - yesterday first day India vaccinated highest number people world. I've heard use leftovers people sites close whether eligible not. YMMV area course. friend almost got argument woman gave shot feel it, wondered needle broke prior something else wrong. gets lot arguments. I‚Äôm ready! thankful one ones get misread thread title 157,000 wondered: really think many people going die US vaccine rolling out?

And saw 15,700 thought: Pointless. Focus energies getting vaccines arms. track participants years. obviously can't months. It‚Äôs cuz got new, significantly better President total resident cases match aggregate sites saying since non resident information reported person's home county realize aunts cousins got lucky? barely 1% vaccinated. feel bad, get soon. Pfizer Living high volume tourist town, numbers bad bc many locals, course all, work hospitality staying home. We're ordering grocery delivery takeout staying far away busy Duval Street. parents, grandparents sister got first doses India.

I'm states think I'll get next months. big relief know family though.

That said elderly relatives states able get vaccine quite early. you!!! \*crazy eyes\* That's happens narrow majority need rely Manchin Sinema. end giving two conservative Democrats keys power, without them, there's approval bill. Unfortunately we'll likely see lot Biden plan gutted due two, including minimum wage increase, student loan debt relief, healthcare, etc. Disney made 63 billion dollars revenue 2020. slightly 2019, yes, 2018. There‚Äôs reason ‚Äútighten belt‚Äù pants fit fine. Thankfully didn‚Äôt either. like state while. even know went garbage. end day leftovers allowed used willing arm. speaking colloquially. trained epidemiologist, certain amount experience here. There‚Äôs never going definitive proof virus retreat reach full eradication something close it, want see evidence we‚Äôre separating historical trends. 

If see collapse patient numbers previously established lower threshold, strong evidence interventions real work (we‚Äôre suppressing known natural baseline). point would seem reasonable link circumstance vaccinations specifically (making random chance pretty unlikely). Within margin reasonable assumptions, would feel comfortable saying point we‚Äôre well way normalcy, we‚Äôve ‚Äúall beaten thing‚Äù. 

You wrap assumption kinds hypothesis testing frameworks whatever feel like, end result same. robust indicator get number still trending down. added 600 non resident old deaths days ago. CNN's headline trash.

Their headline suggests CDC's position fully vaccinated caught virus. That's case.

The number fully vaccinated exceeds number lab confirmed cases, note article many experts (including CDC, though say that) agree many infections confirmed. family buys right wing anti-vax conspircy stuff (there left leaning anti-vax people well arguments different, Bill Gtes Democrts trying mind control people secret chips). told I've gotten it, need extra drama right personal choice. try talk believing crazy stuff I'm hoping come around people get it. least vaccinate people set expire. fact government think preferrable throw expired vaccines opposed giving someone outside age group absurd. Yes, state emergency stay effect achieved FDA approval vaccines, achieved large-scale analysis real-world data generated speak, traditional drug trials. There's much experts work Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J right get ready data arrive.

We 34 active declarations emergency US right now, dating back 1979. Europe benchmark, need way better Good. belongs museum. could make argument people would stimulate stores visits/not worrying covid summer, probably going states left significant restrictions. book travel them. Yeah, former Crucell spinoff Leiden University. main crown juwel PER.C6 manufacturing technology, developed Lex van der Eb. JnJ integrated technology extremely well within company invested heavily vaccine technology. credit countries, I'd say. I‚Äôve worked COVID units I‚Äôve watched people thirties dying COVID. I‚Äôve seen children pediatric icu multiple vasopressors keep alive developed heart failure COVID MIS-C. Dr. Andrew Fauci said last restriction lifted mask mandate. may find hard believe sure researched nothing, wrong. feel bad enough wrong actually put effort learning science behind instead posting bad opinions social media sites like this. Comparing state something horribly actively lies numbers good excess mortality bear conclusion.

You're going need better source ""random internet troll"". Here's one anything said US official Trump administration suspect you. used stamp card also big area know, sounds like check around multiple sites seems indicate appointments fact filling increasing size elgible pool help things out.  Likewise, can't wait cross border occasional weekends Vermont. guy sarcastic. first guy super serious. UK's ONS- saying gold standard research anything, pretty solid survey. 10% people experience least one symptom (pretty nebulous) period 12 weeks longer. That's implication, can't speak numbers reference. Normality hitting Tell families half-million people died...  Exactly. worded perfectly. may also get way weaker another way. Basically it‚Äôs going become super death Ebola Ever get sense it‚Äôs becoming really hard health officials hold line ‚Äúmasks mid 2022‚Äù??? Meaning don‚Äôt actually believe it. read article basically stated virus keep definitely keep mutating, probably can't keep finding new ways evade antibodies also remaining dangerous. Thank correcting me! volunteered vaccination clinic past weekend (though solely give back, finished vaccine series already). Spent saturday standing/walking around full sun (parking lot) directing traffic funnel cars different vaccination lines. really far people, everyone masked. nice. interpret vaccine efficacy‚Äîwhat ‚Äú95 percent efficacy‚Äù ‚Äú66 percent efficacy‚Äù even mean?

Vaccine efficacy refers well performs carefully controlled trial, whereas effectiveness describes performance real world. common mistake interpret 95 percent efficacy mean 5 percent chance getting sick even get vaccinated. true all. Efficacy calculated based trials unvaccinated placebo control group, end trial, look number control group ended symptomatic COVID get baseline infection rate. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, instance, 95 percent efficacy clinical trial. number came fact 162 people placebo group got symptomatic COVID, eight people vaccinated group did; 170 cases total. Eight approximately five percent 170. essentially efficacy calculated. COVID vaccine clinical trials reported efficacy preventing symptomatic disease, necessarily severe disease; early data latter promising, Yeah still going trust redditor says ""I think he's wrong"". seem like despite countries universal healthcare, need updated nationalized. surprised global players pushing localized everything agenda countries. localizing government services another divide conquer scam. therefore trial.

I never said sure like copy paste lot crap

lmao love Fauci experts say crap match preconceived notions. mean incredibly unlikely. 95% efficacy mean 5% chance contracting symptoms? add asymptomatic that's greater 5%. misunderstanding? Thanks. frustration asking source non widely known thing - reported They‚Äôve ones screaming don‚Äôt need social safety net, though. people would rather child go hungry support struggling parents. people happy police murder ‚Äûundesirables.‚Äú They‚Äôve never ounce compassion us frankly don‚Äôt deserve back. all, world they‚Äôve built advocated for; it‚Äôs time chickens come home roost. 

Plus they‚Äôll long gone time millennials get power actually implement social programs. Vaccinate young people don‚Äôt infect people return maskless parties? Er that's shitty hope think I'm bot.

Any vaccine good vaccine. great. still couple months away.

#Don't blow now!!! read new CDC guidelines. seem optimistic nice hear little concerning time. say vaccinated visit indoors, unvaccinated people, masks/social distancing people single household, long one considered high risk serious case. thought whole point distancing masks know affected that's healthy people asked basically mask isolate time. mean till (and im going get vaccinated week) we've basically visiting one except 1 family member masks distancing.

So message someone vaccinated EXTREMELY low odds catching/transmitting covid unvaccinated person? unvaccinated person healthy big deal? last part concerns me. I've held kids school year safety reasons obviously there's vaccines kids. know supposed say fk risk getting he's healthy?  plan cancel it, suggested close illegal? mean put effort find answers asking people provide sources? Mom Grandma said "" Yay vaccinated wear mask anymore"" that's really concern. want see friends maybe large gatherings live music come back months. wear mask anymore far priority list. It‚Äôs going make people‚Äôs heads spin quickly get ‚Äúback normal‚Äù now. 

The thing think could stop happening completely year kids don‚Äôt approved vaccine may while. time don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll kids go year, what‚Äôs probably going normal summer, shove back learning factories masks recess September.  Aside you‚Äôre going see full stadiums SEC next season. way NBA doesn‚Äôt full season fans, think they‚Äôre enforcing masks 20,000 people....I guess unemployment solved teams don‚Äôt enough ushers right now. simply going point can‚Äôt enforce guidelines longer won‚Äôt make sense. Ex: go get tanked bar 2am 1st grader sit behind plexi glass mask on. C‚Äômon...society isn‚Äôt that. pessimistic days think that‚Äôs possible snap it. Worrying is... way put it. many 'variants' displaying E484k mutation, suggests convergent evolution. would mean creating boosters easier. Congrats! Seriously. argument literally ‚Äúif can‚Äôt fun can‚Äôt fun?‚Äù Give break Correct I'm wrong (and know will!) number _down_ something like 1/3, right? today‚Äôs report Pfizer plenty neutralizing variants studies variants don‚Äôt unlimited latitude mutating, I‚Äôm really concerned. 6 months scariant worry gonna go way mink strain - changes RAW DAILY GROWTH RATES.

When vaccinating billions people worldwide, rules always going followed letter. long personal profit involved, I'd chalk ""shit happens."" absolutely extremely politicized especially rural communities. difference time people talk shit run like never get it. me, much valid concern the, ""vaccines cause autism"" crowd. admit personally little trepidation it. legitimate concerns long term effects vaccine. ie know ill effects 5+ years manifesting presently. There's simply way know that.

This said, there's lot smart people worked tirelessly ensure they're putting safe effective. Further, vaccine entirely new either. Lots work done something similar years back, decently well understood developed get go.

I suppose I'm saying sympathize people *legitimate* concerns, non-zero amount. Many linked think rollout 65s pretty poor beyond storm. storm definitely factor percent doses administered dropped, fine catch front.

In county signup system online major technical barriers. doses getting administered favors tech-savvy 1Bs.

We knew coming. Yeah definitely one person. CDC started misinformation led others running it. Meanwhile, Georgia almost 1 million vaccines sitting ice. Except vaccination rates exceeding new infection rate country mile, even Florida. May result slight bump cases, nothing else. going rely others get vaccinated. That‚Äôs taking huge risk. talks would assume rates won‚Äôt continue spiking? less confident near lay scenarios. people say next fourteen weeks going worst pandemic. viewpoint says every time saw B.1.1.7 become dominant strain, saw twenty-per-cent increase cases three- four-hundred-per-cent increase. So, happens base sixty thousand seventy thousand cases day, looking several hundred thousand day, course horrible may surpass worst days. that‚Äôs concern lot public-health people bring think unlikely. think could see bump, think much smaller, two reasons. One lot population immunity vaccinating people. And, second, seasonality. spikes largely happened countries holiday season. even now, Europe, countries, starting see B.1.1.7 take off, starting see real bump cases. that‚Äôs contradiction: confident middle late April? feel comfortable see massive spike but, rather, small-to-medium spike, keep vaccinating, vaccinating, vaccinating. And, mid-April, vaccinated high-risk people‚Äîwe see hospitalizations plummeting, even case numbers somewhat high‚Äîand vulnerable people covered, see large numbers infections then. experts think optimistic. saying governors ‚ÄúHow lucky feel?‚Äù nice part waiting weeks get sense likely play out. People still confusing symptom free covid free. similar situations prevalent countries age restriction done away with, vaccinate much possible?

there weird dynamics working. US, states parts states getting vaccinating, extra doses. places, getting vaccines shortage. end result live rural state area, get vaccines want. city, lot harde.r  Maybe shit hole little extreme, experience people consider USA developed country either never USA USA.

You it. hope helps family. Stop doomposting.

Yes, variant cases rising. Yes, one looking slightly lethal vulnerable populations. We're already vaccinating population good portion protection already.

We're unlikely get another explosion hospitalizations deaths due rise variant cases rate. 1/4 country partially vaccinated decent portion vulnerable fully vaccinated. Isn‚Äôt normal though? I‚Äôm vaccinations even get covid vaccine give bunch information saying it‚Äôs FDA approved vaccine issued used due state emergency something.

It also says long term effects unknown duration vaccine known. don‚Äôt fully know severe persons reaction vaccine could gets point suggestion call 911 you‚Äôve fallen seriously ill. literally tell giving shot. 

So course people would worried. Czechia, Belgium, Slovenia, UK deaths per million 2065, 1918, 1878, 1828 respectively Lol, good summary.

Just keep eye UB doesn‚Äôt trip Random Dude‚Äôs maskless anti-vax friends get drunk bad media pass track. Grand Prize Bar whole nother establishment.

Try  .... Well that's utter horseshit. US state, Georgia. restrictive health orders since July 2020 never mask mandate. add winter. cases peaked January 14th deaths January 20th sustained decline US state, Texas. allowed business openings 50% capacity June. implemented statewide mask mandate July. effect since. cases peaked January 15th deaths January 26th sustained decline since. allowed everything open 100% capacity rescinded mask mandate last week, cases still US state, California. indoor dining closed pandemic. implemented mask mandate June. December, entered lockdown. cases peaked January 14th deaths January 27th sustained decline since. 

Since December 1st, total deaths per million residents three states:

1. California - 887.64

2. Texas - 805.07

3. Georgia - 794.07

Are telling restrictive measures California caused cases deaths go down, Georgia completely open time? cases going up? left house since pandemic started?

I many questions. recipient pfizer vaccine, nothing short fantastic news. Dose 2 2 days... There‚Äôs site anyone trouble finding article. Took couple minutes sign up. agenda IMO, reporter looking number thinking positive sign without looking deep data. everything conspiracy campaign. use engineered version virus instead actual virus?

Please read vaccine technology behind it. companies use dead vaccine. Sinovac makes vaccine.


They safe. Sinovac varying reports. Singapore still undecided grant authorization. HK, Indonesia Philippines using it. Philippines giving general public health workers. ‚ÄúYou assertion wrong didn‚Äôt experience it.‚Äù get part job speak press

That's part job HORRIBLE at. job. medicines help us flatline corona win pre-corona lifestyles back I'd assume are. similar story across countries well. Thought already development (along countries well) Again, India proving hero country COVID No, CNN still pushing ""Experts say WAVE coming upcoming spring break"" ""VARIENTS"" articles. can't speak whole country definitely know people neck woods remotely high risk able get vaccinated early due ""connections"" Yeah fair enough. 

I guess I‚Äôve grown weary whole debacle cannot see end it. Illinoisan also chiming in. Still dead.  ok Lmao bet can‚Äôt explain why. Kids isolating made sense vulnerable got vaccinated. never kids elderly vulnerable. Yeah. It'd like France/UK reporting less 200 deaths, 125 Spain That's great.

I wonder many others like got flipped new CDC guidelines vaccinated. seriously comeback people have? insinuate everyone blindly trust Fauci (who admitted lying multiple times) backwater Fox News injecting uber-right idiot? sort insane ""if 100% us, evil wrongthinker doo doo head"" rhetoric exactly much mask/lockdown debate gotten politicized. yes, sides it. rate, Gunshots murder back top time. think there's lot people vaccinated still. true number infections likely 3 times higher reported numbers testing. might dumb question, reports new findings Pfizer only, Moderna well?

I think lot reasons mainly come Pfizer much larger, established, better funded pharmaceutical company Moderna. preexisting relationships academics, producing vaccine doses internationally providing countries, money fund research. Moderna contrast kind safe assume similar results Moderna vaccine whenever new headlines come Pfizer?

I'm expert speculation, target protein, similar RNA platform, showed similar efficacy results human trials. think make inferences that. Thanks large part Donald J. Trump! Moderna Pfizer vaccines use exactly mechanism deliver mRNA nearly identical results multiple studies. study, going use one them, Pfizer widely available. yes, fairly safe assumption assume study Pfizer effectiveness also applies Moderna. I'm sure Idaho give shit restrictions already, save airfare. simply disagree way it‚Äôs handled. NNN bit extreme, even subbed I‚Äôm anti vax. I‚Äôll give example think handled.

Take pre 2020 pandemic plan, instance UK: it‚Äôs pretty close think gone down. 4.18 Foreign Commonwealth Office issue advice regarding travel affected countries. plans attempt close borders event influenza pandemic. UK generally high level international connectivity, likely one earlier countries receive infectious individuals. Modelling suggests imposing 90% restriction air travel UK point pandemic emerges would delay peak pandemic wave one two weeks10,11. Even 99.9% travel restriction might delay pandemic wave two months. 2009 became clear pandemic virus already spread widely international authorities alerted, suggesting case point pandemic emergence missed several weeks. economic, political social consequences border closures would also substantial, including risks secure supply food, pharmaceuticals limited evidence restrictions mass gatherings significant effect influenza virus transmission14. Large public gatherings crowded events people may close proximity important indicator ‚Äònormality‚Äô may help maintain public morale pandemic. social economic consequences advising cancellation postponement large gatherings likely considerable event organisers, contributors participants. also lack scientific evidence impact internal travel restrictions transmission attempts impose restrictions would wide-reaching implications business welfare.
4.22 reasons, working presumption Government impose restrictions. emphasis instead encouraging symptoms follow advice stay home avoid spreading illness. However, local organisers may decide cancel postpone events pandemic fearing economic loss poor attendances, public may decide mix crowds, use public transport options *7.4 pandemic, Government encourage well carry normal daily lives long far possible, whilst taking basic precautions protect infection lessen risk spreading influenza others (see Chapter 4). UK Government plan close borders, stop mass gatherings impose controls public transport pandemic.*


And you‚Äôre gonna say, well flu. That‚Äôs true, however, designed pandemic flu, extremely deadly, like 1918. Maybe modified slightly, me, complete change document situation UK isn‚Äôt justified. example: said possible 2011 report, 2011 report still didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúlock society‚Äù Taking account this, practicality different levels of
 response, planning excess deaths, local planners prepare extend capacity
 precautionary reasonably practicable basis, aim cope population
 mortality rate **210,000 ‚Äì 315,000 additional deaths, possibly little 15 week
 period perhaps half three weeks height outbreak.**

The UK 143, 259 deaths year. opinion overreacted. Yeah, downtime.

And people aren‚Äôt shitting saying Ebola fake taking active measures mass spread it.

In countries it‚Äôs shared experience, US assholes throwing dark indoor parties restaurants outside typical business hours ICU‚Äôs full.

Even hardship isn‚Äôt felt citizens. Expect think get reinfected fast lol old technology

That quite accurate haha. pretty modern sophisticated. tech JnJ AstraZeneca. additional twist - two doses different vaccines essentially, use different vectors. likely main reason Sputnik V efficacious AstraZeneca's. Worldometer shows 45k w/o MO dump love coronavirus vaccine protective strains Way die every day shit. So? People always get sick. rare get severe covid. Wether like not, Trump good job getting ramping vaccination production presidency. seeing pay now. see could make males sterile? Cause found fever get side effect effect sperm fever. various sources debunking myth female fertility. fact looks like covid could harm feritility: Thank joe biden!!!!!!@@@!!!!! part said false.

Condolences. Faux News cruel master.    Yeah do, interestingly excess deaths period actually covid death figure.

Personally think comparing countries death tolls, different ways counted, overly helpful. Exactly, deaths coupled hospitalizations coupled cases, smart thing obviously attempt reduce cases.

Once decouple results reduce risk overcrowding hospitals, becomes less important strictly control case spread Nobody defeat virus without massive vaccinations several countries fact manage stop spread almost entirely, example, Taiwan successful. clearly huge differences countries handled virus absurd say country right. best countries like Taiwan almost deaths without lockdown. worst huge number deaths, months lockdowns, overfilled hospitals massive economic costs. US one countries handled poorly, although worst. weird US suddenly lauded news vaccine rollout getting shit rest world 4 years straight (and rightfully so) keep saying, ""Every single report,"" bullshit.

Show work links, stop trying convince parent hurt kids. Except poor countries guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Also AZ doses produced globally others? agree; however, idea ideas gave involve something spooky hackers steal credit card etc. argue mistake compare something complicated. Yes, lag around 2-10 days reporting deaths. Sometimes longer. state‚Äôs (Oklahoma) still updating numbers January February due huge surge had. DMV 2 hours getting license taking road test re-do since license expire year. 

But I‚Äôm home showered disinfected phone everything I‚Äôm thinking packed I‚Äôm nervous Covid. 

I got Covid like 2 weeks ago. reason I‚Äôm freaking potentially exposed dmv. 

Covid negative since 2 weeks ago. Got sick early February Covid least Rhode Island rollout extremely slow.

Has been? 1 5 people gotten first dose. obviously added restrictions added always effect

I access original article. 'always' correct? 'Already' would make better sense. worry that. [Old Country Buffet training video get back speed time. Enjoy! kid croup year seemed keep cough little longer afterwards sucks everyone thinks he's got covid. suffering PTSD toilet paper hoarding 2020. Yeah, also overloading replication virus sounds like playing gmdabgetous game. wipes out, good. helped evolve faster.  Um dont know essential workers healthcare workers many teachers vaccinated. Also along 50 60+ group designations, Ohio includes access anyone number chronic conditions. friends brother 20 type 1 diabetes got first round pfizer vaccine Monday morning. got Moderna yesterday. Sore arm feeling fine, worse flu shot far. theyll give extras people would likely throw away got lucky. Pharmacist even called buddy looked like typical stoner friend. Good helping people get extra ones. Daily?! There‚Äôs totally lingering symptoms like you‚Äôve described. common post viral infection. 

These things need separated things like anxiety. contrast, end 5 days placebo groups, infectious virus varied 18.2% 200 mg placebo group 30% 800 mg group

Really seems like need run bigger robust trial get excited. Promising results, thousands promising drugs pan bigger trials. please normal September 2021 sir deal:D I'll take pecan see they're offering. reported numbers always day behind. I.e. number reported Monday reflects vaccines given Sunday.

Obviously fewer locations providing vaccinations Sunday number lower! really hope administration charge US makes national ""We beat Covid 19"" holiday sometime summer. everyone gotten vaccinated, least people have, long enough time second shot. think would good nation day, maybe three day weekend relax work. spend time going supporting small businesses like restaurants bars. best ones linked population studies convincing. collectively willing countenance myriad different things create risk kids innocent people dying society function people pursue happiness. Welcome real fucking kids going sacrificial lambs, adults pretend things fine.

Exactly said worded different fuck problem here? Spring break! Woo! ‡≤†__‡≤† ton open appointments though... demand kept supply even opened couple weeks ago. Sure, none exported since UK owns entire supply? Guillain-Barre legit reason get vaccine, certainly. That‚Äôs neurological disorder quite rare. pointing idea immunocompromised overused, people actually immunosuppressed purpose (say prevent rejection organ) vaccinated. That‚Äôs counting vaccinated today... counting fully vaccinated. count immunity due prior infection, one shot impart protection infection. agree. lied asses downplay deadly highly contagious pandemic half country still believed bullshit. Depends message. Yup, we're plateau now, get ready next round. I‚Äôll pay it, don‚Äôt care might able read Incognito. It‚Äôs good article lot statistics. One oddly leave substantial elderly population Florida. I‚Äôm saying California shouldn‚Äôt locked down. I‚Äôm saying people kept saying ‚Äújust wait Florida going pay decisions‚Äù keep saying wait more. never comes fruition.

I always advocate really two ways manage this. Strict extremely harsh lockdowns like managed China, Australia, New Zealand. Testing tracing that‚Äôs viable early stages. that, wearing mask using common sense going net results shutdown saw California. real world data israel UK... variants spreading. long mainly talks deaths lag, hospitalizations lag would able see actual graphs themselves, isn‚Äôt case since last two peaks January July occurred exact days. they're immune it... carriers. talking about? Indiana better job places like New Jersey/New York IMO getting old age brackets first. reason hear stories Indiana people eligible unable get appt. New York like half state eligible based stupid categories like BMI 30. means low risk young people tech savvy getting appts older people need. saw percentage distribution vaccine Oregon around 12% evenly distributed age groups.

That's exactly said originally bunch others got butthurt reason. used make fun USA covid response, tables turned. Well done. 

- France. Yet, neurologist told ""absolutley not"". got Gillian-Barre Syndrom tetanus shot Dr. told no.  No, I‚Äôm getting bombarded useless information pseudo intellectuals think quoting study (that doesn‚Äôt actually prove argument) makes right. data bias people interpreting are. fact think replies constitute ‚Äúschooling‚Äù says lot pseudo intelligence ü§£ü§£ Damn it‚Äôs crazy it‚Äôs almost can‚Äôt offer advice haven‚Äôt tested. people actual scientists.

Anyone else find explanation confusing anything else?

Viruses work self replicate, host's cells them. overload something replication work? vastly increase viral load? Sure, everyone take risks. people acting like there‚Äôs line constitution says it‚Äôs god given right attend super-spreader events. I'm pushing doom gloom. we're 85% way there, need stay focused stay course. area news vaccinations lowering numbers resulted people abandoning precaution, want see avoided. may closest urgent care @ 35 miles away since already ""bad stuff"" happening car way home drive anymore went home.

I consider ER afraid make another stop. ER waits long. closing 116 million (100 million since inauguration) around day 50 Biden‚Äôs term. 200 million shots 100 days isn‚Äôt insane goal, we‚Äôll see hit 200 million people vaccinated. omitted ""in healthcare workers"" link. Cloth masks ineffective healthcare works compared surgical masks. like that. good contain virus also good climate Look France lmao 70,000,000 people voted for.... mean can't? don‚Äôt disagree vaccinated people meeting vaccinated people normal manner. made clear. 

What object vaccinated people feeling like don‚Äôt need mask around I‚Äôm ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù, assume. It‚Äôs also fuel anti-maskers implies it‚Äôs ok ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù people get covid. 

Israel isn‚Äôt nonsense, admire that. 

I‚Äôll edit clarity, thanks Never got card? get card within seconds getting vaccine. need card get 2nd vaccine. I‚Äôve read mRNA vaccines tougher time various variants elderly immunocompromised less immune response vaccine. doesn‚Äôt sound like problem vaccine much populations. can't speak states, CO moved next phase hit 70% 70.

IN moving appointments 2-3 weeks start bit trouble filling winter storm signed whole bunch people phase get shots door.

I would love see evidence states hunting hesitant delaying progress vulnerable people havent vaccinated. think agreeing point. 1/3 republicans people dad retired, 70, able get it.  Don‚Äôt worry! Texas fix that!!! what's like wrong everything? Hell yeah Brother, cheers Iraq! Suck it, Bolsanaro. Nancy? pointing comes mouthpiece Chinese government. It‚Äôs important know. Many people like clue source posting. Jfc. People think this???? /s know :( way around though. Infection wild type less useless vs. South African variant unless first round almost killed you. know, born Leiden, vaccine developed, proud! read apparently US got first 4 mln doses Dutch plants, 'new Baltimore plant' produce 'the bulk' US doses still feels like potential problematic situation arising here... least already knew going problems delivering first, last minute AZ. It‚Äôs almost like... vaccines actually work.... 

You wouldn‚Äôt know Facebook feed üôÑ Linking YouTube video favorite libertarian author providing data. Please link peer reviewed scientific paper. rules, like post follow them. actually yes, responsible Moderna vaccine development. internet hospital terrible doubt anyone actually changes behavior Texas. Folks weren‚Äôt wearing masks won‚Äôt wearing them, tell people interact everyone else still is.  ""smart"" received two shots.

So like 55-60 million received least one doze, comes around 20% saying give Covid chance. Like countries NZ advanced purchase agreements place months 4 different suppliers. APA's like placeholders countries using them. Countries move placeholder stage activating APA actually purchasing vaccine. happening here. NZ already bought 1.5m doses previously already using vaccinate border healthcare workers right now. NZ zero covid status could afford wait see vaccines performed well side affects settled Pfizer. understand reasoning alot people outraged. know least 70 million Americans would have, deaths disability damned.  Hmm okay. impression due supply constraints, could probably provide 3 million 1+ doses per day, neglecting number second doses. make stuff fast. Unfortunately can't convert old factory manufacturing center. Also looks like 18% sort vaccine-driven immunity. Couple ton infections may hitting ~40% population sort immunity. vaccines resolve ""long Covid"", consider *very* strong evidence symptoms psychosomatic. known mechanism generating antibodies infection *already resolved* would treat lingering effects said infection. Yeah, lot people basically addicted hearing bad news well. like seeing car accident know awful, can't take eyes it. Por favor know wasn‚Äôt widespread covid, yes I‚Äôm little snarky responses :) 

My point though none would possible polio vaccine allowed people continue spread it. small pox, mumps, etc. 

There‚Äôs even chicken pox vaccine now. little, sent play friend it. 100% class got year. stuff way infectious covid haven‚Äôt heard anyone years. Yeah get lives get long term complications virus get vaccinated 2-3 months ü§ôü§ôü§ô countries practices, cultural not, cause disease hurt and/or kill millions people, practices either changed altered safe. 

It common knowledge many wet markets Asia caused many different diseases illnesses. know go purchase sell items could potentially make others sick, handled clean sanitary way, yes, fault part problem. majority Chinese population purchasing selling goods, knowing could dangerous past, majority Chinese population part problem. People like blame Americans general American COVID spread, thus Chinese general blamed COVID itself, then, logic.

Obviously, changing fact happened, however, accountability taken, changes made wet markets. Last checked, exact one started completely reopened. problem, thus Chinese government disgusting inhumane allowing things continue happen, continue put millions peoples lives risk.

Any practice country altered stopped causes infectious deadly diseases altered stopped immediately. true certain areas world, applies every single country. UK United States common practices place knowingly put millions, more, lives risk, yes, would say United States, UK, whatever government is, inhumane disgusting allowing happen. say wet markets idea risk, countless studies topic, welcome go look studies free time.

So, again, please explain logical argument behind I‚Äôm ignorant? fucking hate part. someone wearing piece cloth face cause stores close? types social distancing capacity mandates absolutely lead losing business, see mask mandate harms businesses. There's ambulance-chasing attorney saying he's going *lot* cases. essential worker 50 cancer host conditions, still can't get vaccine. Yes. Sounds good me. Latest stats theLawyerCraig (new covid tracking project)

Everything dropped. lot unvaccinated high risk person

A rapidly shrinking group people. emotional maturity child. 20th-27th Feb. we‚Äôre falling again. Fairly embarrassing last year EU announced cutting scientific research budget. get headline ""watch out"" ""please careful"" true. far herd immunity 4th spike possible. We'll better accept that. Yes, don‚Äôt mean imply Democrat problem, I‚Äôm thinking places like California Illinois particular. Governments like power, regardless letter name. sounds like Bolsonaro population control Hitler type cleansing aged sickly populations. getting away this? mean yeah.

The real best advice would world wide 3 week long stay home order. honestly would never worked. due logistical reasons (people need supplies) people would ignored it. say doesn‚Äôt want kids go back school? course health risks lower apply far smaller number kids educational costs. don‚Äôt understand can‚Äôt mention anything health risks Covid kids without getting debate schools. 

We talk risks flu children without acting like anyone concerned doesn‚Äôt want kids go school flu season (an obviously unreasonable suggestion) Covid adult vaccination way. Russian military agents spreading lies vaccines‚Äô safety efficacy. needs consequences this. kill people threatens economy.

How many social media comments seen really trying wreck vaccine response? way combat adversarial country spreading propaganda within country. Make sure get important news information trusted sites, social media comments unaccountable sources. lol, like Georgia won‚Äôt open we‚Äôre vaccinated not. Star Atlanta past weekend people acting like COVID already disappeared. study postulates airborne pollen reduces immunity respiratory viruses therefore makes us susceptible Covid infection well. Sorry made mistake, Brazilian study (with lower efficacy results) used pcr-only method. Turkish study shows higher efficacy used standard pcr+one symptom find entirely plausible claim true, ""a State Department spokesperson said..."" actually strong evidence something true. Much like government press people nations, United States State Department's people known frame things around national interest fashion conveying truth, whole truth, nothing truth.  see anything, I‚Äôll try remember link it. made really hopeful them. 

I also heard previously Covid, temporary side effects might rough vaccine (kinda like hear 2nd dose) really hope get point mutation vaccines work. happens, people blame everyone listening. got first shot yesterday. sore arm. That's it. Otherwise feel fine. People get shots. safe. Loads safer possibly getting covid. 95% protective original variant(s), new ones causing concern. Look continue delude thinking over. There‚Äôs reason boosters third moderna shot example, 2nd one isn‚Äôt end.

I‚Äôm saying live cage masks still important ‚Äúdoing whatever hell‚Äù want ridiculous think 2nd vaccine dosage end Brazil one assure that. governor hard-on restricted state country many big counties similar hard-ons like LA Bay Area. anywhere country isn‚Äôt back normal January 2022 counties California. 

That said, California county, many businesses stopped obeying rules. *[Sad Canada noises]* seems rollercoaster studies vaccines.

At one point, vaccine gets ""doesn't seem work"" days weeks later, ""oh, works"". 

The one seen disproved astrazeneca vaccine working south african variant. That‚Äôs fully vaccinated. well ahead Virginia partially vaccinated 22%, think person referring to. Can't wait change ""We're midway first nine holes second round four round golf event, actually match play event, depending many holes we're up/down COVID could end sooner maybe not"" Damn, awful take Yes, but, think death rates plummet far enough, skepticism rise again. Similar attitudes MMR vaccine, people assume others provide protection, need get vaccine themselves. experience almost certainly would‚Äôve driven insane. props weathering storm Story ‚Äúkeeps blowing up‚Äù, yet guy hasn‚Äôt troubled read commenting. Classic reddit. Guessing lot reddit call ICE brown people, dummy. give shit country they're can't get registered perhaps CVS, Walgreens, Walmart? state list handing appts? It‚Äôs already happening - I‚Äôve received several baby bridal wedding shower invites spring last couple weeks South African variant? Cancer patients survivors groups getting vaccine now. routine scans. Many oncologists radiologists asking vaccine timing it‚Äôs essential patient‚Äôs educate indicate scan given vaccine held back 4-6 weeks swelling occur. every press release designed healthy. even then, women getting routine mammograms need questioned vaccination scheduling scan. vaccines aren‚Äôt obsolete. variants may moderately decrease efficacy, it‚Äôs like 0%, let‚Äôs start over. India annual polio vaccination drive till weeks ago, logistical strength shared vaccine supply chains. mess around polio vaccines, non negotiable. 

As soon completed, citizens 60 45 comorbidities allowed get shots. registration process online, shockingly seamless simple. pick center, pick slot show up. Simple that. 

A lot private clinics also expressed willingness centres, hopefully see number places get shots shoot soon. Serum institute apparently production absolutely order too. 

This done much quicker across board previously anticipated. *if take live vaccines* 
 drugs suggest live vaccines impression legally, restaurant patrons country supposed take masks eating drinking. practice, perhaps complied with, rule technically seems same.   sarcastic? turned Pfizer needed government‚Äôs help all. clear supply chain holdups, company executives pressing Warp Speed order Defense Production Act, would give priority access suppliers. OWS candidates taking advantage DPA months. OWS hesitated. administration officials say worried Pfizer would use size market clout muscle Moderna supply chain got equivalent status DPA.
Pfizer‚Äôs production holdups huge impact U.S. vaccine rollout. trial results announced, OWS expecting 20 million doses November 20 million December. Instead got nothing November 20 million doses December, flown Pfizer‚Äôs production site Belgium, make gaps Kalamazoo.

So Trump used Defense Production Act factory farmed meat, wouldn‚Äôt use equitably vaccines. many people died vaccine delay? Agreed. Just. W.T.F. People easily guided. Mislead word wanted.. uncles /aunts cousins already got vaccine India, meanwhile high risk parents haven‚Äôt US. :/ numbers around month behind though. Deaths right much lower.  Article headline

It's Reuters/Journalism thing guess idea. text even written weirdly show joke. Yes, aware. argue go far enough based know transmission. Florida went 65 many people, including everyone 60 up, based % hit 65 gotten vaccinated.  gonna get anyway, workplace offered extra paid vacation day.

Does growth rate matter? March, yes. May-Dec, probably not. peak hospitalizations impacted care, rate rose there.

If growth rate higher, change cases death, means peak lower shorter duration get area. ridiculous. even read article? clearly intended humourous. Interpreting serious somehow conspiratorial reader, author. people see joke? workable solution make list dosed remain end day call folks in. Makes great sense! Eagerly waiting next state drop restrictions! since September. means many ‚Äòlong COVID‚Äô patients psychosomatic symptoms. list constitutes long COVID nebulous encompasses vast range common psychosomatic symptoms.

It crazy general statements generation played 2020 now. almost spot on. 

We always expectations generalizations group aren‚Äôt like it‚Äôs normal, I‚Äôm stating seeing area rural haven‚Äôt hit hard covid feeling current vaccination rate enough avoid large surge. rate decline may slow weeks; doubt could called another surge. [Trump secretly got vaccine . 
 
There dozens news agencies reported thing. That's able snag one, ready close day trying get rid extras made call stores PA system asking anyone wanted get vaccine. ¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£¬£ Good riddance, 1% dead end pandemic. prob, catch vaccinated, chances severe cases slim.

The Covid-19 vaccines type make people allergic though, like vaccines proven incredibly safe, mention effective. think missing point necessarily accelerating replication rate, greatly accelerating rate mutations speed would uniformly disadvantageous virus. 200 million basically guaranteed point late april, 300 million goal since US around 400 million available point AstraZeneca Novavax sub used full people genuine caution respect pandemic. full jokers like you. agree. It‚Äôs also really annoying say something like someone responds ‚ÄúPeople dying stop selfish.‚Äù People really don‚Äôt understand sacrifices young people make pandemic. mean, insane, like wonderful. That's guess, point quickly getting point many people left eligible. good, many rules create confusion. conversations quite people eligible realize got sign say things like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs point even coming back? It‚Äôs lost year start fall.‚Äù 

I suspect saying paid time off. reporting long verification process deaths. they're really reporting totals January. One big issues people equate common cold flu. runny nose days call flu.

My, time, 5 year old got flu last January went Legoland. spiking fevers 104 coughing bad almost took e.r. several times. Scary stuff. 

We usually get flu shots last year. miss again. data opinion based on? Pfizer always best efficacy. catch variant like SA one dangerous happens got Pfizer? See data variants None vaccines perfect advantages specific cases. That's recommend approved vaccine: need limit propagation much possible people cherry picking treat that. solution protect vulnerable people like baby: protected everyone else. Lmao what. Vaccinations available everyone meets requirements Florida. get vaccine pretty much hospital (thats grandparents got it), pharmacy (thats dad got it), they're even using stadiums mass vaccination sites, stepmom got it. Ik u guys like hate Florida we're pretty decent job vaccinating, still home I'd able get since asthma can't state live college. yeah bias quite obvious. least people aware bad normal infection, one normal replication time, higher viral load would presumably bad thing. several studies suggested patients higher PCR values would likely require hospitalization. 

But, based infection normal course. replication rate isn‚Äôt fast enough cause mutations, result would lots circulating, viable, infectious virus. 

By increasing replication rate, though, rna viruses likely make mistakes mutate uncontrolled rate. idea speed replication enough create mutations actually detrimental virus rather allow naturally mutate gain biodiversity needed evade host‚Äôs immune system. 

What you‚Äôd end lot quickly replicated, useless mutants (or less effective ones). enhanced replication speed keeps virus efficiently producing viable virus, makes sense. wouldn‚Äôt consider measures stop covid simple. 

I would consider entire collapse rebuilding society hard. that‚Äôs would take prevent covid. superintendent sent info bring, I'd already known vaccinated first dose point I'd paying attention r/FloridaCoronavirus people post lot updates, went sent info colleagues.

It seemed like rules changed every day last week, expect lot people eligible still know still trying get form filled out. it‚Äôll end pandemic, jab eyeball. Oh boy I'm sure people would love police officers went door door asking people get vaccinated... I've heard perception Americans love talk country up. Everyone know seems think Europe Utopia constantly criticizing America. Conversely, visit relatives England, generally ones talking putting down.

I know everyone's experiences may vary, think I've come across many people talk America up. I've come across way people countries (particular Canada, England, New Zealand) quick tell country better mine even though never really said otherwise. calculated :). second dose March 23rd! think lot Asian countries young, healthy populace. Asymptomatic way minimal it‚Äôs made be, healthy people tend asymptomatic cases. 

Americans fat unhealthy, group. Purely anecdotally, seems like older folks know less vaccine side-effects younger ones. doctor friends 50 knocked day dose 2 Moderna. 

My 51 year old teacher friend Pfizer luckily side effects (other sore arm) either shot. started breathing mouth heard humidity masks helps prevent infection. Turns breath doesn‚Äôt smell good. already said reaction reaction mean whole lot. I'd imagine means employee working customer-facing position place that's open public. Based reading, risk probably less actual flying airports given filtration air happening plane.

If flying soon prior vaccination I'd trade fabric masks filters properly fitted KN95 best avoid taking off. Keep distance airports like would indoor location crowds. way air filtered planes (it's happening every seat running HEPA filters crazy high rate compared indoor settings), there's someone unmasked twenty rows ahead that's far less worrisome neighbor unmasked. I'd exercise basic common sense unmasking eat neighbor eating, instance. worry much spot someone unmasked walking bathroom, basically.

Like others said think much safer people assume, flown year would want take basic precautions peace mind, hope helps! I've year now, need reminding people greedy, stupid assholes. prudent certain extent. think ever trust manufacturing 100% live global manufacturing reality believe control 100% resources required produce own.. Canada bind now.

The question much sit on? small number. put perspective, that's 100,000 extra Americans dead compared French rate. 

So ""not... much better"" relative, especially relatives 100k people""  Yes, amount blocked doses luckily still extremely low. Especially compared massive amounts EU already exported even donated. vaccines dude. one greatest scientific achievements modern history, dance around reason pandemic going away. mutagenic, meaning takes advantage virus's tendency mutate kicking overdrive point virus mutates irrelevancy. property also makes drug concerning, since cells could spur growth development cancer used incorrectly. IIRC, huge concern drug due target fact suggested course short (5 days). yes generallize literally billions people stupid american shit lol 

the planet's gonna die anytime soon delusional think current generation ""friendly"" planet hardware store N95s now. bought pack 10 grainger $30 Really hope don‚Äôt kids. must sooooo dumb like daddy. remember hearing long ago ~9/11 daily deaths tolls. 1k 3x relief. progress made still, trending right direction FINALLY hope they‚Äôre teaching kids trust social media comments unaccountable sites news shit causing much harm. aaaah. Ok. comment makes sense. have, situation changed. we've seen real-world results vaccines vaccination program that's making substantial progress, pretty much know thing ends, least US. then, media responsibly report much going happen, one really knew sure. People going go droves outdoors summer regardless. Even summer 2020, lakes *packed*. said, incredibly frustrating he's kept us dark Phase 3. ready move forward state, country - disservice public transparent.

As large events, superbowl (and events alike) shown us anything, large outdoor gatherings/sporting events clearly superspreaders. hopefully state government allow types things.

I've read articles quoting head honcho Moderna asserting shots (that is, getting shots) provides immunity 2 full years. tbh think best practices annual boosters, similar flu shots. hopefully, least one pharma companies find way combine flu shot COVID would really prefer efforts government businesses

I hear that. year we've had, I'm sure message could somehow get &amp; convince anti-vax people getting vaxxed all. like ""hey, know global pandemic killed 520,000 Americans fubar'ed economy? protect it. free! ...

Again see saying. I've board vaccine beginning, got soon could, got 2nd shot 2 weeks ago, I've got much immunity anyone.

For ""24% say NEVER get vaxxed way"" think efforts bear much fruit. inclined consider education ""fake news, govt lies manipulate control public"". consider economic incentives ""bribes take 5G microchip juice funded **Bill ahead USA vaccine trials kids vaccinated sooner

Jerusalem Post article says 400 people Israel hospitalized despite fully vaccinated plus week.  article posted says zero people ended hospitalized, entire world, 7 current major vaccines around world.

How could numbers different?

Here Jerusalem Post article.  also preventing spread. may friends someone immunocompromised person, co-workers friends may be. vaccine 100%, could spread someone vaccinated. small sample size though. I've thought thing. vaccines safe effective, want get unscientific look ""ick factor."" I'm surprised people squeamish mRNA vaccines genetically engineered viruses, me, mRNA *lower* ick factor. ""ickiness"" bearing vaccine I'll get. expecting 100M monthly doses Q2 according sea witch herself, that's _with_ J&amp;J delivering intended.

150M vaccinated 40%. Restrictions bad encourage people turn neighbours authorities. Also let's call authorities harass people made free choice implement restrictions. Well, amazing difference entire administration hundreds people makes Yes, second part sure. reason hate Kardashians Paul brothers. Yeah they're annoying attention whores I'm also jealous hater. Baltimore City.. Everyone Maryland eligible now. almost 3 months time move likely comes Gamaleya refusal give information regarding vaccine european countries already purchased huge quantities it. really wish reporting discussion around impact restrictions younger people. immediate friend group felt mental toll taken. know saving lives elderly, wish appreciation younger people give that. Careers, dating, social lives etc wiped year now. got worth something right? 

My parents act like lost time nothing. ‚ÄúYou whole life ahead you‚Äù dismissive, condescending thing say young people put everything pause incredibly important years. don‚Äôt know. know it, wish dialogue silent damage lifestyle inflicted. Yes, personally locking millions children preventing going mall. 

Chode, here's tissue. Cry it. Political course That's completely false. Invoking defense production act exact reason vaccine production scaling exponentially. done last summer could avoided winter wave entirely.  problem. problem EU 6 months late ordering vaccines, startup issues September occur now. mean, even knowing bit basic high school biology would pretty easy understand vaccine works safe. Honestly, year since virus first became widespread. fact there's little info prevalence long COVID, especially vaccinated individuals, reassuring me.

People going take long COVID seriously time ever brought hypothetical arguments reopening.

Here's thought process go: evidence permanent side effects (not ""lasting"" **permanent**) come COVID, especially cases among vaccinated individuals? data suggesting high prevalence is? certain symptoms physical, psychological? 

If answer questions answer isn't, ""We're highly confident significant number vaccinated individuals catch COVID suffer permanent physical side effects,"" using long COVID justify continued restrictions acceptable. ""There's non-zero chance vaccinated people might able suffer side effects might psychological might last forever"" *not* solid enough reason justify continued restrictions, even technically ""listening science,"" still speculative. could try think people much luck FEMA sites. stats, example Spain: means +600 deaths 5th March?

I mean, 6th ""only"" 99, 7th 100, obviously 637 impossible 1 day, come from? - Joe Biden becomes president

- Cases deaths plummet 80% two months

What actually changed?

More things open states ever before. Yes Request want Trump admin get credit acquiring many vaccines one fastest rollouts initially.

Man need get sources.

The Biden administration walked plan vaccine distribution spend last 2 months snatching acquiring enough vaccine.

Trump stopped working night lost election entire administration dumped every bit asset management states. feds essentially said ""good luck states"" funneled additional assets sweetheart deals battleground states governors openly positive Trump.

The Trump administration happened exist time vaccine developed nothing ""above beyond"" scope necessity time.

&amp;#x200B;

To point Biden administration job. point evidence extraordinary effort here--just fruits honest/fair labor. stark difference administrations. One administration work, screaming ""poor me, one could known"" jack shit. bit lag death occurs, versus actually reported? anyone know (roughly) much delay? lot selfish children pretending real wearing mask much them. sad. Ivy League scientists random joe internet? States updated eligibility guidelines yet. least Rhode Island rollout extremely slow. vaccine surplus soon, doses go waste states expand eligibility? think biggest reason continue opening eligibility gradually frustrating would fight half state get appointment. sites couldn‚Äôt handle it, never mind check hourly days weeks find open appointment. see here.
Well argue day severity response. think anywhere near good answer anyone. least vaccines start move on. past pandemics Alabama. husband vaccinated way. grateful opportunity. want include last line megacomment, I'll search around bit. Anything /r/COVID19 would ideal. Except starting proven vaccines cut transmission even stop asymptomatic cases. [While vaccine is. everyone access vaccine, going back normal. honestly get mindset people.

What think rest world doing? sitting around twiddling thumbs magically also decided going ramp distribution Biden took office? coincidence entire world slow rollout begin speed since then.   ship already sailed. cannot massively block exports EU point, many important trading partners depending vaccine exports. Yes even would backfire entirely. There‚Äôs plenty people U.S. trust U.S. gov‚Äôt would get vaccine release data instead said ‚Äútrust us‚Äù keep mind U.S. vaccine you‚Äôd need countries unify none Governments release data either. Which, countries non-starter people almost 0 trust gov‚Äôt. It‚Äôs practical smart do. smart present information accurately like football score beyond release data. It‚Äôs also quite unethical to, imagine going get surgery telling potential risks expected outcomes. Medical professionals present information patients vaccines different. crazy reading articles Florida school full time opened issues since August. feel parents students suffering solid year. aren‚Äôt behind. Maryland slightly ahead Ohio % basis (npr tracker). think better question would seem like states getting higher shipments relative population others. sees pretty obvious NE got bit allocated (looking Connecticut). God love movie Meanwhile Brazil... hear like racetrack announcer...

America dropped 1000 COVID deaths first time months. comes Texass coming behind! making run hopes killing citizens! thought safe, republican states stick you! course nothing feel ""proud"" of, can't see optimism it? Less deaths exciting you? Similar PA. Good luck getting table Saturday night county. Young people vectors, know means look parasites diseases youtube... state get worse seen already.... Unless new stain vaccine resistant. part joke, covid real dangerous also life lives... need find blance point fear carefree. fuck talking about? I'm angry destroyed society economy respiratory infection overwhelmingly affects elderly...just like literally every respiratory infection.

All grandparents died random respiratory infections past decade. deaths count ""covid""? Yes powers greatly benefit people working whole world it/s. least conspiracy theory makes sense made first shot still masking up.  BING!
 
c‚Äômon folks, OP joking. CDC's latest study, clearly trying show restaurant closures worked, found states lifted indoor dining restrictions saw one percentage point increase new cases month restrictions lifted. also able show restaurants caused increase versus changes behavior time. Along John Ioannidis, MD, DSC, Stanford, Bhattacharya co-authored Santa Clara antibody seroprevalence study, preprint published April suggested coronavirus infections (and possibly, immunity) 85 times higher scientists originally thought. **The study, became tool political debate reopen economy, criticized lacking sound evidence. later revealed BuzzFeed News study received funding founder JetBlue, authors disclosed.**

I knew sounded familiar point isn‚Äôt clear Neat. people countries right deserve gold standards vaccines? Yes? ok moving  PhD ‚â† MD Think so? still think states gonna aiming perfection hundreds thousands doses go waste name ‚Äúequity‚Äù far Variants seem covered fairly well existing vaccines.  idea variants cause major problem vaccinated little support it.  thing seems worrisome could cause increase cases among unvaccinated due increased infectiousness. 

But, finally article medical expert seems saying actually think rather saying think need say manipulate behavior. Getting rid enormous bloated cheese ball last President wonders!  think telling someone drive half conscious expose entire waiting room flu better idea? wait patient call ambulance? talking giving everyone cold, we're talking giving asthmatic patients sick get doctor's appointment classic flu symptoms. Unless doctors wants house calls, call stuff like in.

The risk OP, someone situation, deciding get doctor, passing behind wheel way significant. giving someone needed medication take risk like reasonable. Telling OP call ambulance need they're sick drive doctor much bigger waste resources giving prescription tamiflu may need. restaurants generally great profitability standpoint. much better investments want make money opening restaurant yeah owners making sweet $$$$ lol never see power corrupt quickly.

Genuinely curious. think people power gain extending lockdowns? ""I demand science this, can't use science back beliefs"" - exactly crap we've dealing past year. Still science effectiveness lockdowns either. Amen! 
But saying anything along lines year ago called selfish a..hole wants kill everyone else grandma! 

Even one fortunate get affected either financially lost anyone covid19, questioned methods used start long time effect, also specific industries got decimated (tourism, restaurants etc...) take long fully recover.

Like most, knew additional waves possible. Yeah.. hear you. (don't necessarily agree,. understand coming from). 

You see kind analogy/comparison lot industries (technology often compared Cars, etc).. yes,. analogies risky imperfect. 

It's pretty hard manufacturer point view though,. variety reasons:

* want simplify things down.. FAR (not ""to simple"").. either risk sounding like pandering (or insulting people's intelligence).. end simplifying much people's understanding shallow (or people accuse ""making simple, probably hiding something!)

* also decide going use comparison/analogies,. there's Pros Cons (or doing) that. 

* matter do.. audience diverse (from basic.. highly capable highly intelligent).. bound piss percentage people matter (IE = lean hard ""making simple"",. annoy frustrate intelligent people..and vice-versa,. make ""information-rich"",. overload simple-people. 

That kind ""communication marketing"" easy get right. also know FL manipulated it‚Äôs data honestly clue deaths correctly classified there. Die heart attack....nah, it‚Äôs Covid FL, need test. look excess death numbers get real picture there.

You right let‚Äôs take look that. California 63,900 excess deaths. 26% reported Covid deaths. Florida 34,600 excess deaths. 18% reported Covid Thankfully vaccines fairly good even variants. go back normal eventually. parachute successfully slowing decent, take now. need wear way get ground.

You‚Äôre putting baby lot less risk taking J&amp;J today waiting Pfizer rather taking anything all.  I'm saying you, I've noticed anytime post like suggests COVID sort coming end world pretty much resume normal activity, handful people want believe true. back normal year, guarantee.

RIP anyone enjoying COVID life excuse stay inside nothing day. get impression anything saying sky falling qualifies coronavirus disinformation according Facebook. Scientists found vaccine 66% effective preventing moderate severe COVID-19 symptoms, 85% effective serious illnesses. United States, shot 72% effective** preventing moderate severe COVID-19 J&amp;J tested single-dose option 44,000 adults U.S., Latin America, South **The J&amp;J vaccine confers immunity upon lot faster Moderna Pfizer vaccine.** Really two weeks, start protection one shot, we‚Äôve seen clinical trials. Whereas Pfizer takes four weeks Moderna takes six clinical trials Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, see differences based geography amount virus that‚Äôs circulating different parts world. That‚Äôs efficacy varies, really depends intrinsic vaccine, also going community. Moderna Pfizer trials done original strain circulating, aggressive mutants contagious virulent may impact numbers we‚Äôre looking at. source this? might using wrong search terms can't find information talking about. Sooo...mental health important topic? 

Hate break you, illnesses stop happening spreading COVID existed. Lol wonder people going lose mind like hydroxychloroquine Technically Pfizer could also used one shot vaccine. Pfizer never tested two dose regimen that‚Äôs would using today. conversely J&amp;J tested two dose version that‚Äôs would use.  I've said sticking prediction:

By mid-April start seeing national ad campaigns begging people get vaccinated. Exactly one year ago (March 10, 2020) went Rogan's podcast said would 480k deaths ""conservatively"" next 3-7 months. conservative prediction turned overestimate factor 2-4x. episode still available YouTube like watch it.

On podcast also said vaccine several years. Less one year later lost count many good vaccines created.

Meanwhile, ""Category 5 Covid Hurricaine"" caused Variants predicted six weeks ago starting right now. Clearly happening he's moving goalposts again.

For reason people think he's sort Nostradamus comes pandemic. entire schtick based trying scare people pandemics always been. Outlier it‚Äôs clear sign significantly decreasing infections deaths. 

It‚Äôs ok let guard negative We're trying reduce mortality/severe illness. Vaccinating 20 year old grocery store workers cause, unfortunately. Cool! airline! Pre-covid flew United CLE least 4x week (as passenger). looked back pre-departure, nursing old-fashioned 1A. net difference cases deaths?

The CDC study explicitly answer that, significant increase growth course months suggests answer yes. cases/deaths/100k lower mandate/no dining states.

That's logical way analyzing, since virus infect every place way. example, Florida South Dakota lax rules, latter done far worse due factors. Historically mask mandates effect numbers cases.

There, fixed you. That's okay, wanted general idea now..I've seen wide spread end March fall. Thanks We‚Äôve vaccinated rest EU combined. Poor EU. independent. We're 9/22 now. particular transmit, unknown. 

We know vaccinated carry virus vaccine 100% effective severe COVID, let alone right infection. know someone vaccinated gets infected high enough viral loads Infect someone else. There's waste list? Depends state would bet end April. one knows sure though. Ah Googled again, right, applied late February. must've missed it. anyone like called stupid? No. mean one stupid? No. AVers stupid? Yes. Nice! could detect Covid way back last February/March, right? Vaccine resistance vaccinated people carrying virus getting sick. Please read this. virus becoming endemic please mentally prepare fact inevitability since April 2020. there‚Äôs difference concerned acting morally superior everyone Yeah, shocked even try mention people fl older. Can't try biased everything do. Stick arm! sleeve already rolled up! Oh come on. Excess capacity problem easily better scarcity; that's millions millions extra doses order. 

The problem foresee summer everyone relearn talk people person again. Sounds like he‚Äôs real C U Next Tuesday. bongs like 30% userbase thiz sub americans like 60%. Stop acting like victim, lmao. upvote yourselfs posting data puts AZ good light downvote studies show worst. Thanks, would interesting see broken age furloughed last April month. initially worried going back office real smooth sailing. wear masks wash hands often.  true all. 
Source: live Tel Aviv visit Jerusalem often easy little fuss AstraZeneca utterly tanking orders promised you. mentioned thread, one thing keep mind people see right subset population may may represent everyone. 

Obviously people treating Covid isolation standpoint, wonder long term impact covid fear habits changed. 20% population permanently reduced dine habits, restaurant industry got hurt people go back normal right? wife probably ate restaurant least twice week never cooked lunch.... go back office habits changed. won‚Äôt scared coming months eat out, I‚Äôve started recognize much costs reset year probably affected others habits too. That‚Äôs good restaurants long term initial ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go restaurant!‚Äù Phase recovery over. Sign up. *poor* deaths. don‚Äôt care poors. /s explain logic me? would drawing doses existing vials bad thing? Agreed. types people it‚Äôs better ask feel way. Usually nothing actually conspiracy. dig deeper lack confidence social structure, people fear usually cause. Conspiracy easy bandwagon jump on. Humans want feel apart something feel understand world. applied UK approval. Ahh see. That's unfortunate, sounds like made best :) Operation Warp Speed indeed amazing thing. However, looks like despite interference POTUS, would use buying chloroquine hydroxychloroquine cronies. CDC set guidelines opening schools person education, completely ignored parents willingly ignorant mean ""schools safe"" immediately ignore recommendations. So, blame guidelines. thousands Israel. go hospital? Im sorry sure asked lot, current timeline vaccination healthy young adults? April? feel seen different answers, hard sift see experts saying. Operation Warp Speed started Trumps administration laid ground work distribution logistics. work stop giving stuff clicks. everyone wants vaccine gets one, unvaccinated person endangering anyone unwilling accept risk? mentally handicapped individual risk based decisions, black white decisions. vaccine dramatically reduces likelihood infection period. Furthermore, due reduction viral load, dramatically reduce likelihood spreading, vaccinated individual get infected. Lastly, note, CDC specifically excludes households someone risk severe COVID. 

So summary, three massive reductions risk unvaccinated, placing risk well normal illnesses. country vaccinates whoever would like vaccinated, don‚Äôt understand considered hoarding? understand neurological symptom confusing disease known infect nerves cells. suspected symptoms caused anxiety previously? new administration reason vaccine rollout way it‚Äôs Caralho maluco que inveja feel bad guy‚Äôs personal business death becoming internet joke. least don‚Äôt know name, guess. Party Grandma. Good news. lack shame, anonymity Reddit ""never give even face intellectual shellacking"" attitude find appealing? I'm sure, certainly enjoy watching play out. could eradicate every last terrorist terrorist organization earth, middle eastern countries suddenly became secular democratic republics, anyone reasonably believe TSA would dismantled? No, argument keep would ‚Äúwe must vigilant next threat might arise.‚Äù Ditto pandemic, it‚Äôs question much, interesting see long term prosperity population shift among states places like Texas, may well fully return pre-pandemic posture, California probably not...and exodus already happening. South Korea didn't? good link last sentence?  lick EVERYTHING! Indeed vaccine development handled well quickly put emergency use. 

The issue comes resulting effects: calling pandemic hoax, discouraging masks, basically saying big deal even got sick?

Yeah, that‚Äôs idiocy directly leading misguided folks dying even politically neutral people dying due idiots following Trump lockstep. UK data: people experience least one symptom period 12 weeks longer. imagine say otherwise usa news. need news hate president. least day, really know administered. find recap latest information learned Covid? I‚Äôm noticing people gathering, social, even training jujitsu gyms face-to-face, would nice know information discussed last year media wrong correct still unknown. use mRNA sequence. real difference lipid nanoparticle dose. Cases aren‚Äôt thousands even though. can‚Äôt take mask live normally vaccine literally point getting read case nursing home Canada everyone vaccinated yet dozen people tested positive covid. concerning? Exactly, right benchmark. understand people cant seem remember every president first 100 days analyzed tradition. Maybe I'm getting old seen many times now. Love silver lining! Thanks! stop peddling anti-scientific crap. There's thing ""second first dose"".  vaccines immune system work.**

If anywhere close right either statements would vaccine SARS MERS.

The incorrect assumption made many human immune system reacts human coronaviruses viruses.

Not antibodies behave completely different antibodies provide cross-reactivity HCoVs might seem like benefit presented greatest years mRNA HCoV vaccine studies demonstrate best T-cell reactivity first vaccine ""primer"", second first dose week 3 third first dose week 6.

The risk immunity reach 92.6% single-dose day 42, risk immunity reach 92.6% second dose immunogenicity nullified existing immunities. going create dangerous expectation immunity.

The 21-day schedule complements full range immunities population. Deviating done based serological results. 

What Qu√©bec different going NPI herd-immunity. got J&amp;J vaccine yesterday. far side effects bad. woke middle night cold hot, arm sore hot got shot, nothing little Tylenol fixed. truly worse flu shot. qualified shot work children living.

What expect got shot feeling relief washed me. realize much mental heavy lifting I've pandemic! know takes body produce antibodies vaccination I'm going let guard down, relief real. Every shot arms much closer end pandemic. I'm protecting myself, I'm protecting kids work public whole getting vaccinated. Early research Israel‚Äôs data point vaccines cutting transmission. 1. mandate even removed yet.
2. I've hearing, restaurants (and businesses general) keeping mandates. You‚Äôre special one aren‚Äôt you? Hundreds thousands people dying due LOCKDOWNS. Right. worries...my mistake sleeping redditing... Biden‚Äôs policies 0 measurable effect this. It‚Äôs vaccine. I‚Äôm saying Trump lord savior handled start virus terribly. mean vaccine availability information poorly communicated? Florida? You‚Äôre kidding.....

Our governor refuses even publish plan, people idea line or, suddenly told get vaccine, don‚Äôt fully understand go proof, any, need show get there. 

For example, 30 year old diabetic expected produce official state form physician attesting medical condition. 

But, assume (?), people work education, regardless age health status, show say work education, documentation required. 

Confusing poorly managed. like personification immune system seems Terminator-ish. reading headline imagine redneck squinting strain going ‚ÄúFuck it, close enough. probably take‚Äôm, boys!‚Äù you, hillary ? oxfords vaccine? anyone know? seem Pfizer lot us UK jabbed astra zeneca source results? offense, assume athletes world class least good enough play division 1 level better shape you...I would assume recovery would faster basically everyone else planet...


I wouldn‚Äôt worried recovered faster you, encouraged recover... literally every no-waste list

Where might one sign lists? Please thank you. Enjoy ignorant bliss. people still carry transmit virus

This proven. Yet. may case can, proof. is, right now, evidence vaccinated people spread virus. autogynophilia.‚Äù Haha prevent American super-spread herd mentality. Maybe didnt think funny.  Put social media pictures along hateful comments walls let people see despicable people are. right, see rest it. Thanks. Yeah, make sure stay bunker another decade, hundreds thousands people suffer die due lockdowns Good know! Hoping hit several 3M days week understand healthcare providers would access vaccination cards aren‚Äôt useful providing proof vaccination stadium events anything. would disclosing vaccination status medical history form anyway doesn‚Äôt really change anything. soon research complete done. turning point There's approximately 0.5M deaths US 30M positive tests, giving fatality rate 1.66%. Estimates true fatality rate range 0.16% 1.6%.  half person, means likely every student back campus, classes end going person. ""But still spread it"" people shambles really, better latter. Yay! add short, pudgy, bald men I‚Äôm golden. signing production contracts big pharma left right now. know done earlier. Perhaps phase 3 data needed convince, perhaps severe vaccine shortages, prospect variants made big companies get now. think misunderstood question like wanting force people exile forever getting looking actual guidance convince loved one. sorry get it, really sucks. hope eventually see people safely getting change mind least we'll hit herd immunity provide protection. like 5 million people going hard buy I‚Äôm NYC, 34 pre-existing condition....I started looking appointment Friday, able find one three days later. I‚Äôm getting evening.

Your parents something wrong. Instead getting defensive, try help them. one cares ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù, alternative dying. gotta say getting optimistic seeing decline past two months increase vaccines. Basically lost last year half college hoping I'll get normal time summer starting job. Oh I‚Äôm pointing across board all. I‚Äôm opposed higher taxes across board something besides mostly going boeing. Although also consider drop bucket problems currently face country problems yet fully manifest we‚Äôve already done. agree division must win attitude politics huge cause this. Don‚Äôt see going anywhere time soon though unless trump starts party divide republicans party dems separate libs. However think wouldn‚Äôt even don‚Äôt think either side split 50-50 within way. 
 myriad problems face society I‚Äôm nearing point seems unwinnable politics taxes that‚Äôs currently stuck with. Hopefully folks way smarter figure out, sentiment also lead are. It‚Äôs wild world. See Trump correct along. Like magic. 15th still chance catch Covid, still probably follow local/ store mandatesz

But personally wouldn‚Äôt hesitate go maskless locale doesn‚Äôt require Oh right, sloppy searched pseudovirus missed using authentic virus well.

Still can't directly extrapolate T-cells also exist. really hope right. I'm exhausted studying home can't take lockdown. considering people thinking virus throwing safety wind, I'm scared we're gonna end another lockdown, goes college experience wasn‚Äôt point. Unless you‚Äôre talking someone else. Best luck you!  Yep... Californian, non-partisan problem policy decisions become arbitrary longer able willing show based science (e.g. shutting restaurant industry outdoor dining evidence increases spread declaring entertainment industry essential). ignored requests data support decisions. upsetting willing destroy complete livelihoods without much thought fault own, despite existing protocols keep open safe, also ignoring increased risk alternatives people would find gather.  there's whole arbitrary zero-nuance regional ICU capacity metric used justify decisions non-essential surgeries requiring ICU space ($$$$$ hospital) never stopped. There's also  
 mismanagement school openings... mention hypocrisy actions. Bottom line is, easy see recall effort gained much support. Fall 2021 semester starts 6 months. college US saying they're going restrictions like described nuts. 6 months we're going virus. info underweight/severely underweight? I‚Äôm vaccinated curious whole time might affect never found info Calling first fist fight/screaming match Friday. many heros. doctors nurses scientist. I‚Äôm thankful you. went thru hell covid. able get vaccine today emotional me. Thank risk long-term health consequences reduced similar degree. There's millions parents kids want in-person learning resume, okay deny concerns minority that's easy cater to. want kids specifically go back school, there's plenty online alternatives you.  public around people vaccinated: wear mask. many (probably majority of) situations private residence good not. Actually paper use actual virus samples along pseudoviruses shows 10 fold reduction neutralizing titer vaccinated individuals.

I agree can't make direct correlation vaccine efficacy that, strong data Thanks clarifying, totally misunderstood. family members anti-vaxers, convinced grandparents (in 90s) take vaccine else might die.

Idk No, seems like two ride together, three get together maskless without distancing. agree, lack public guidance issue lies. Biden administration needs lay plan mask indoor capacity restrictions end, otherwise states gonna decide own. good news US done vaccinating people large amount production capacity become available countries less power and/or competent leaders. mostly symbolic move allows Abbott tout hyper-conservative base. believe it, actually moderate response semi-responsible compared people state would liked be. folded like coward trying ice storm hit.

The true losers really mostly still unvaccinated service workers business owners directly deal defiant, asshole customers entitled. Especially conservative areas find harder harder argue people challenging store business. hard exhausting throw someone trespassing trying run store, restaurant, business people assaulted even killed people asked put mask. 

Most conservative areas barely following protocol, irresponsible bars definitely open full stop already operating close speak easys/free alls already, faking restaurants. Oh sure looking safety side effects main focus children's trials. misunderstood question thought asking we'd know effective kids get less severe illness. Pfizer said enrolled 2,259 children 12-15 trial. find concrete plans yet future phases companies yet.  country prevented virus entering, spreading within it, completely?  


My point gamble, everything mitigation, ones ""did things right"" still fucked virus, varying degrees. Europe perfect example. anyone decrying Merkel someone blood hands, care people? took seriously, right? leaders Italy? France? 
The US gets special treatment criticism, know why. Don‚Äôt worry, won‚Äôt learn anything 4,712 (0.31%)  fyi, actual V, Vaccine, 5 lmao  First vaccine technically given half 20,000 trial participants no? back may 2020.   lying coward nothing disagreement. keep claiming administration ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt plan‚Äù, I‚Äôve linked plan multiple times  Troll Anyone notice CDC website finally included J&amp;J info? Excited see numbers jump next days! Obviously great news size sticker vaccine card really bothering  tested positive previous infection November first dose Moderna vaccine month ago, supposed get second dose Friday. meeting doctor afternoon hopefully tell viral load high enough considered infectious. Disappointed guess, hope shedding genetic material.    see lot middle HS teachers there, elementary sped lower grades teachers.

Don't get wrong sure people work district shitty administrators, likely overworked underpaid return little precaution organization wrong. Also teach hybrid schedule make one teacher teaches time classroom remote students time, lame. funding issue schools made worse districts..

Where kids go specific remote person classrooms. teachers medical condition risk got priority remote spots, classes limited 15 etc... districts live worked whole time. teachers staff eager see kids again, many hated forced classrooms. 

But states started done getting teachers staff vaccines, know protection work, cases going drastically states etc... folks sub excuse left want stay remote next year. 

It matter much kids got wronged, care kids there, parents fault kids fail, even sped, bad parent become teacher assistant qualifications night care job not...

Some used COVID19 pandemic let frustration onto parents (there bad ones aware) ultimately shitty administrators. like parents blaming teachers stuff fault, easier. goes way around. Easier teachers parents others throat  Could true. highest estimate Netherlands 3 million 17 million. would put mortality rate 5 per 1000. lines nicely numbers (100 million = 500k deaths). Nj open 16-64 pre-existing condition. list conditions pretty expansive.   many positive?  anyone wants vaccine get one, mask comes off. though. That‚Äôs 1000% understandable, hope you‚Äôre okay, please try worry yourself. Especially nasty case covid you‚Äôll prolly need time recover panicking won‚Äôt help. hope feel better soon, it‚Äôll okay. CDC useful transgender womb people Hong Kong refusing Sinovac vaccine appears killing people.  feels true. state, winter surge looks like 3 times bigger original surge amount deaths little bit lower. barely started testing late summer even still, testing much all. 

I don‚Äôt think numbers give anything close actual picture. Probably peaks similar much bigger know.  people seriously expecting by? summer?

It'll rebound colder months.  Woah easy buddy, go calling people know lying coward agree you. /r/copypasta Amazing fast thing mutates. Looking Israel UK, think could realistically take bit longer. reporting pattern tends follow sinusoidal pattern, we're probably getting numbers bottom curve cycle. 

Still, hopeful get within next 4-6 weeks! Well case must true.

Sorry, really links provide contrary, know anti-Trump media been. also find peculiar Trump plan still able out-perform majority world, Biden able step continue trend administered vaccines increased. no, get it. everyone wants vaccine get one that's *real* problem starts. That's phase 2 Bill Gates plan, bring back murder hornets foreshadowed earlier chapter.

Seriously though hell person need psychiatric help think enough vaccine everyone ""really going bad shape?"" please put head posterior fart twice. You‚Äôre right man 

I really bad case Covid put hospital I‚Äôm like traumatized lmao feel like I'm going find increasingly depressing watching Western residents express much wish countries could like China. new tech, mRNA used build vaccine HIV. However, first time mRNA vaccine cleared FDA CDC. it‚Äôs brand new technology haven‚Äôt many opportunity, lot promise cancer, infection, etc. Except data showing. Variant cases increasing percentage cases increasing. Left unchecked, would lead cases going don‚Äôt get ahead vaccinations. aren‚Äôt yet. stopped vaccinations today, cases would ultimately go along deaths hospitalization given variants transmissible lethal based evidence have. Balancing though fact vaccinating vulnerable. nobody say certain yet stop trend present data. Overall cases coming down, true cases produced variants. I‚Äôm optimistic able blunt rise, work get done. cats count kids right?  always reliable powerhouse. Good thing many countries increasing domestic capacity dependent China future. already done PPE. exactly reason got vaccinated, main concern interacting people. 

It's qualms masking go out, even post-vaccination -- watched many people know die get injured months, want visit anyone else. According Multigenerational homes defined households people two generations reside elder grandchild. include parent guardian caring child would think parents eligible, they're really caring brother rather cohabitating. Regardless think go qualify spirit. like pharmacist going home visit. I‚Äôm 61 Santa Barbara county. showed CVS March 2 penciled spot.  mean yeah cause obvious proven differences locations impact spread virus. like America got fat year, decades workings.

I'm saying masks measures removed population vaccinated, obviously should. I'm saying bit ridiculous say vaccine worthless otherwise whole purpose save lives, either way. Interesting. found system incredibly easy. Frustration still there, actual signing up/registering really simple DOH. half 80+ vaccinated 70+ started recently (last week), would guess 20% 70+ vaccinated (by least one dose).
As vaccinating medical stuff, emergency personnel, 70+ seniors teachers (and teaching asistents).
And younger younger people getting ECU (average around 57 yo, 30, 40s years olds rare). I'm really proposing plan action, though. indicator number I'm drawing attention to. People free manage opening however like around it, I'm trying counteract hyperbolic headlines.

Personally want see something lower nadir previous peak, otherwise hard believe we're seeing behavior that's meaningfully different saw August November last year.

These articles claiming ""It's lowest months!"" misleading, decrease ""The lowest months"" due enormous, monthslong surge experienced. news meaningful we've declined previously observed levels pandemic. Right exactly doctor make appointment with... homeless live tent. 

Where go? go there? got second shot passed Thursday! 6pm rolled around Friday suddenly felt like midnight. 8pm came felt like nighter. showered went bed woke Saturday morning 7am felt wonderful. experience effects first shot. I'm gonna go limb assume mean 'medical professional' like Fauci, despite professor type policy changes economy. 

There've plenty economists saying open, plenty lawmakers too. Thankfully, scientists provide us data actually make policy decisions they're entire goal ensuring minimum amount people get infected thing possible, despite agreeing economy. Get publix website every Monday, Wednesday, Friday around 6:45am. site adds new appointments 7am puts waiting room. 

If you‚Äôre fine standby, get FEMA site nearest you. They‚Äôre open 7am-7pm take walk ups.  Hey now, Brazil‚Äôs infection going well. Might well finish South America lose. travel industry close shop every single person world vaccinated? would suggest not. mean, cabal uberwealthy - people work industry need income, customers interested paying service (and participate safely), that's good thing.

I mean, like car TV manufacturers going stop producing everyone afford products.

I fail see point here. Two million vaccinations day barely year later yet we've failed... 

Did ever occur may realistic expectations? That‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on. 

No one denying existence. goal overrun hospitals. Hospitals overrun. Things open. point, thread started pretending covid goal lockdowns exist get rid covid. 

But never plan. It‚Äôs crazy people rewrite history. pretend goals different people don‚Äôt agree completely made reality somehow foolish tad nutty. question results release margin error +/- 3.5 percentage points. 

If sampled 802 well, number enough.  I've received 3 calls last two days ""Cdc Natl Immun"" according spam filter. ignored first two picked third said hello hung up? number 312‚Äî871‚Äî4243 google mixed info it. Anyone idea is? There‚Äôs fee vaccine. Maine age eligibility only, imagine waiting long humanly possible. great incentive volunteering, benefits clinic community. Yes. husband COVID first week November still sense smell whatsoever. taste almost normally. got second dose Sunday life gooooddddd Agreed, us Rodents make poor conversation. Absolutely, I'm doubting that. stating vaccine fast tracked, funding place, 16+ million vaccinations million vaccinations day Biden took office. Reddit seems never give past administration credit, credit due. incredibly intense feeling sympathy young folks like getting worst everything that's come Covid - loss opportunities, social time, year formative times life. I'm years university can't fathom trying go school right now, let alone law school. 

Shot PM ever need ranting space. Summer, Fall, Winter Holidays going batshit insane people making 12+ months pandemic took us Good reminder. Lowest Monday long time though! I‚Äôm hopeful. parents recently got first dose Pfizer vaccine. first time year, I‚Äôm feeling hopeful :) forced trial population science

Dosing intervals selected trials never scientific dictum. concept find really difficult understand. I‚Äôm 34 took time (aka fucked lot) getting college finally did, honors. nearly 10 years ago. college years amazing even though probably couldn‚Äôt even things back anymore, still objectively fun life now. 

Sure like different things appreciate life way college couldn‚Äôt. don‚Äôt think comes close offsetting fun lack responsibility college. I‚Äôm anxious depressed time without enough things pull like 20s. big part friends willing abs able anything anytime. *is* Reddit, all... Plague Inc new update play cure, quite well done. reality is: turning down, get rid restrictions quickly.

Though sounds counterintuitive, consider: people want get vaccinated; want get rid restrictions they, least everyone else wanted shot, got theirs. want vaccine; also want get rid restrictions.

So, split electorate two groups people, want get rid restrictions time vaccines available everyone wants them. Politicians want get elected, go restrictions.

Obviously, fewer shots arms moves date closer. also means deaths, illness, hospitalizations, largely, everyone ok it. ...and that's get trying mature conversation hamsters. fault, really. Ugh garbage disposal way stairs Masks tho!! üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤ know, rule world. Go forth write letter resignation.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  wtf need go back normal order dominoes pizza?????1? You‚Äôve proved ignorance already, there‚Äôs need pile on. Couldn‚Äôt said better Seriously. One friends note allowing get vaccinated (required live). asked got appointment yet. said no, time got website, full. asked 7am site refreshes. said no. Obviously priority people. Nah. hard work developing distributing vaccines paying off. owe anything canada.  got first Moderna shot today feel energized crystal clear. feel like every vaccination get. excellent! 

And then? mind-boggling heartbreaking, coming someone country weathered Covid pretty easily. cannot imagine whole year like that. Hope family vaccinated soon! freely government handing money, I'm sure nobody would mind (or even notice!) immunocompromised also get it. literally could added ""its"" make less ambiguous. Sorry, pass arguing people think humans humans irresponsible.

Only fool could seriously expected humans beings stop socializing prolonged period time.

Also cannot take seriously anyone thinks lockdowns worked every piece data says otherwhise. Due self destructive behavior. men often refuse wear mask. less deserving actions. What's foolish people keep arguing want over.

What's even foolish many people think good thing. Denying reality make go away people pointing reality-deniers problem. Many people qualify trials. would jumped opportunity, even without pay, based race, household whatnot, chance getting anywhere... You‚Äôre kidding right? people insane Yes drive friend lol Trump you? latest proposal would give nation‚Äôs 15 largest transit systems enough funding make nearly half annual operating budgets, according Jeff Davis, senior fellow nonprofit Eno Center Transportation. ‚ÄúCritically, also offset covid‚Äôs impact help protect devastating service cuts layoffs years ahead still face deficits,‚Äù MTA Chairman Patrick J. Foye said statement. Alicia Trost, spokeswoman BART system, said latest stimulus plan expected provide region $1.7 billion public transit. negative outlook there, media loves trotting out. already proven wrong continues move goal posts. got first Pfizer today! :D It‚Äôs opinion piece...no data. mean US currently putting Brazil no-fly list maximum level 4. really hope countries same. Bolsonaro deserves worst. Yeah, looks like could go either way. noticed another peak med center last July, seemed resolve quickly January peak. holidays behind us vaccines coming onto scene, think things would improving quickly are. Could effect UK variant, vaccination rates still fairly low Houston? dont get several media outlest arround world done terrible sensasionalistic reporting pandemic?

&amp;#x200B;

You sir, need read more. Thats problem, sample small. Link one expert remotely thinks ""now fine"" please? listen podcast every week explains this.  OG strain still predominant R value probably well 1 now. cases overall falling. B.117 takes Europe hits 50% new cases area. That's R shoot back reflect increased transmissibility. B.117 expected become predominant strain next couple weeks. country way round. ""Libs"" mostly covid truthers antivax (we vac want get it) know left leaning lose smell taste? Ever since January really difficult smell anything taste fine. boyfriends mom thinks I‚Äôm lying says it‚Äôs possible taste without smelling. serious?? really happened?

If so, really nailed point home lol exactly panty dropper stuck husband kids 24/7. absolutely go wondering anytime went grocery store might come home infect entire family you‚Äôll hooked respirators. 

I would guess People less sex year record. Probably Great Depression lockdown. sexy time. medically high risk? PA, get you‚Äôre 16+ medical condition. Actual W.H.O.'S guideline March 2020 story Detroit politicians.  unconstitutional, that‚Äôs orders by, instance, Gov Whitmer challenged state courts ruled such.

You don‚Äôt hear cause mainstream media doesn‚Äôt care tell you, people fighting government overreach months behind scenes. almost arguing man made completely straw. Curious, amirite? long everyone gets vaccine, won‚Äôt matter got. made happy wife, front line medical worker ICU, got Pfizer early, seems less important since there‚Äôs many vaccines had.  Seems like everyday things hear makes think living movie based apocalyptic movies.

The UN summit met March 2019, proposed world leaders plan *global sustainability* pretty vague exactly get entire population board. But, end meeting, everyone present, agreed China boasted played crucial role scheme. Fast track October 2019 event 201, pandemic simulation took place, eerily similar actually happens *few* months later. actually video footage event part discuss shutdown conspiracy theorists say planned benefit UN. *INSANE*! 

Most people *no idea* signed for. But, know what, pretty soon, I'm betting. highly suggest people stop paying attention mainstream media research duckduckgo. Ya really get it. best hospitals educated people around country vaccine distribution somehow hard. mostly think way focused ""priority"" ""essential"" enough practicality shots arms. article also states lot screw-ups trump days. masks I‚Äôve tries far, ones banana republic best ‚Äúanti-fog‚Äù. nose clips use make mask fit perfect Fauci said new variants must US right cases ""exploding"" like suggested? Monday‚Äôs always lower. It‚Äôs Tuesday see bump. Hopefully that‚Äôs case tomorrow. come many people, college-educated fall ""covid truthers"" and/or antivax? think we're gonna finally realize people's behavior state policy. lockdowns shit, people's diligence self-organize self-enforce standards taking precaution mitigate pandemic. Then, better social outcomes everyone involved, instead selfish people fucking shit continuing suffering others. 100%. love two kids death also; there‚Äôs fucking way gods green earth ever locked children. wouldn‚Äôt another baby paid me. way last lock saw easily one worked I‚Äôm going every years kids. quote Neil deGrasse Tyson:

‚ÄùTo abolish mask -wearing laws States rest Nation keeps like designating peeing section swimming pool‚Äù it‚Äôs ready going MN. Multiple channels. shot come March 1st shortly thereafter. Supply ramping lot.

Which infectious diseases expert supposed listen to, lot saying different things different rationales. okay long decisions minimize deaths hospitalizations. Late November nothing brag about. Cases still really high now, headed right direction. Given year we've seen P1 strain Manaus 2.2x transmissability 70% immune escape wrt immunity previous infections, covid keeping up...

Given current vaccines show robust though somewhat reduced neutralization variants, might need shot every years constant monitoring. tried funny make ridiculous sentence using religious phrases automod blocked me. I'm butthurt it. 

I'ma go beat dog. Dumb people always afraid crowd. people vaccinated, they'll see safe join club. fire put lot effort put fire near feet, still danger catching fire moment flames around need water ensure happen, person fire next spending past year pouring gasoline whenever anyone tried put out? what? guy suggested ingesting chlorine viewed main hero battle covid? cares?

Biden right thing, getting vaccines out. That's matters now. old former president lost election landslide. coolest name too. Respectfully, think lot shooting hip, whole lot ‚Äúresounding‚Äù data. estimates IFR varied wildly, literally orders magnitude. public messaging masks mixed consistent. 

Policy decisions definition political, impossible be. Resounding data rarely drives policy, honestly.  course perfect correlation, generally exists. people like MIL keep vigilant getting vaccine, almost matter,cause unlikely spread anyway. Personally, think best use Johnson Johnson vaccines future date enough doses anyone walk pharmacy get shot. Speaking personally, got flu vaccine last year pharmacist offered one picking prescription. told addition dose I'd come back appointment get second shot- healthy twenty something could imagine wanting bother. done less five minutes consider inconvenient all.

Obviously virus bit different seasonal flu, could imagine Johnson Johnson vaccine what's best people really scared infection care going effort getting vaccine. makes things much logistically simple areas people efficacy matter.

Hell, ideal scenario every state country millions doses Johnson Johnson vaccine, could imagine police officers even sort national guard units going door door certain neighborhoods asking people everyone home received shot yet, not- Whether they'd like ""One dose set"" vaccine. I'd argue ideal scenario, even twice many two dose regiment vaccine, logistical simplicity would outweigh efficacy difference matter reducing transmission. easier vaccine makes difference. Hopefully things going get better soon vaccine wise. hope things going like I'm able schedule appointment. Pa entered chat rioting government's response virus, existence virus itself. wasn‚Äôt meant perfectly even adequately frame exact scenario find in, rather, *found* year ago - rather, meant illustrate moral choices aren‚Äôt exact science. change numbers, change parameters, still never exact science. say 10% deaths another age group, say whatever want - point moral decisions aren‚Äôt scientific. LOL...exactly. BMI 35 population see mall ain‚Äôt athletes! long somebody elses kids mine I'm cool it. complete useless metric? Pence article July WSJ claiming over? many people kill? It‚Äôs kids dying, it‚Äôs catching spreading it.  part herd. May ask, elderly healthcare worker? I'm curious seems almost good true. even become eligible job yet, he's critical infrastructure support, like (good) gut-punch told, ""Yeah, week, join list protect kid."" prepared wait May later. live .9% increase people work enjoy lives. smart. Hopefully states takes lot hands run facilities. worked ten hours one long day. numbers favor, never know :) I've never much flag-waiving kinda guy. videos I've seen craziness happening mandatory Canadian airport hotels make prouder ever American. Lockdowns galore horrible rollout vaccine Canada mind-boggling me. Nah, like reported people disease. Pretty sure beginning last year passed people work dumbest fucking shit. coronavirus kill kids? Yes. rare? Yes. What's going happen millions go back school start shit year? going die. trust media lmao. Reason seems like poorly compared guys way higher testing rates, resulted cases recorded, counted people fell ladders covid death, way people guys. Cali people Canada lol. hope get vaccine early northern friend.

Sorry came aggressive, admit sound like bit dick. Pretty sure could vaccinated NYC teachers vaccinated. Yes live much shittier state don‚Äôt enough money transportation better state. would require able work main job. would require vaccinated. got first one two days ago! Halfway there. start looking pharmacies 3 days prior date eligible. walgreens opening 3 days cycle seems instance. sounds... rather negligible? 

I work restaurant never fully closed down, switch takeout 4 months beginning pandemic. 40% capacity since restaurant opened back dine-in, though, tables needing spaced far apart 6 people group, can‚Äôt fit enough people restaurant make enough money pay bills nowadays. said haven‚Äôt single Covid case staff restaurant know of, we‚Äôve lucky (and careful) regard basing Pfizer Moderna vaccine information - listed common side effect. EU signed AZ contract UK 

The UK contract EU contract, exact ‚Äûbest-effort‚Äú clause. line thinking breeding entirely new faction individuals think invisible illnesses matter. sub, think ""anxiety"". Ironically Germany also fully vaccinated much people cases detected (2.5 million) 3% fully vaccinated population.

This tells fucked US was, let enjoy moment. record, Malaysia ordered 6.4 million doses AstraZeneca expected first arrive Q2 2021. additional 6.4 million doses also procured COVAX facility. means Malaysia get enough Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines 20% population. Sorry hear - hope forthcoming reopening border soon. hope imminent cases falling vaccinations becoming widespread least US soon Canada too. incorrect. It‚Äôs positive test results millions infected never recorded such. get virus even fully vaccinated. incredibly unlikely. full vaccination occurs 2 weeks post 2nd jab. agree comment ‚Äúbest years‚Äù subjective, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair minimize experience result. taken chance best year life, toll sacrifice associated deserves acknowledged. Hope ends soon (and us all) begin picking pieces. really think scientific evidence primary driver covid policy? Ah I‚Äôd give naivety... One family members became eligible 3rd, found available appointment schedule 5th, actual appointment 9th. 6 days.  Based CDC website data, side effect profiles aren‚Äôt *that* different.

Headache: J&amp;J 45%. Pfizer 41% first dose, 51% second dose.

Fatigue: J&amp;J 44%. Pfizer 47% first dose, 60% second dose

Muscle pain / Myalgia: J&amp;J 39%, Pfizer 21% first dose, 37% second dose. Florida likely around 50% point, case numbers seem significantly increasing. mention 10% (guess some) long haulers. You‚Äôre talking 2.5 million long term effects. could absolute horror show years come. doesnt matter politicians say. I'm pretty Trump made obvious...


What matters scientific evidence. ""sacrifice some"" ok buddy go play tinfoil hat it. way said really, really comforting reason fuking what? Unethical essentially College zoom cut tuition course matters unlikely is, that‚Äôs decide whether engage activity. still gonna rich people figuring side planet bunker made lead, everything restart society, war break among factions survive!

I want think really like $1 billion dollars. Billionaires even need passports travel globe understanding, they're supposed never too. Based Yeah agreed. seems like it‚Äôs always otherwise reasonable, intelligent people go path. kids, really wonder must grow parents telling pandemic gonna keep going vaccines aren‚Äôt worth time whatever reason...Like, mom health nut too, good sense get real medical care vaccines us. Also New Zealand geographic landmass size size UK, yet 5 million people, meanwhile UK 60+ million people etc put things perspective. surprise sure check exact terms scholarship. sometimes probation periods term recover terminate scholarship could also call see they've adjusted standards pandemic. amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

Yes I'm aware exceptions none work millions others' situations. narrow. consider us non-essential. They've indefinitely re-newing border restirctions year even Biden signed exeuctive order Jan come plan safely re-open border, even Trudeau met, zero words public statements go here. ever good info covid affects animals, particularly cats? really found much googling except possible get infected clue harmful is. Basically I'm ready mostly go back normal wife get vaccinated still worried bringing virus home cat. literally go vaccines made year. 

You explain JCVI UK. Perhaps know! 

Quick. Send letter! swear quality reporting gone toilet. 


Sorry. Could resist pun. However people getting vaccinated going see happen, ND basically masks local level expire end month. ND also 20% population least 1 shot, 10% 2 doses.  


Basically point gamble reach target goal short amount time lift mandate. hypochondria self diagnosed? Title misleading. ~30 million confirmed cases 80 million estimated covid cases since tested for, i.e. mild cases asymptomatic I'm ohio. weired here. republican governor republicans hate. crazy place leader state opposite party leader country saying thing. Heads explode here. disagree. likely high number people care Covid enough follow restrictions today (including unenforceable restriction gathering people outside households), follow restrictions even getting vaccinated without reasonable sense (or least circumstances) restrictions get lifted cause people say fuck get vaccinated.

Of course, people engaging private gatherings whole time, nothing changes immediate term. people been, seen first step many back pre-pandemic life. people get vaccinated, get steps. think people freaked thing past 12 months want go back normal feel 100% confidence GET it. 

Like, vaccines ensure get exposed body quickly replies suppresses disease symptons nothing abnormal. Hell, really cold past 12 months due quarantining. worst case get cold COVID rather risk hospitalization death acceptable. concerned, think multiple options available think makes sense pick best you. however, think message ""don't wait pfizer/moderna 3 weeks get J&amp;J"" 7M great number. Problem administration keeping up. problem people positive might isolate themselves. think lot people isolate themselves, maybe possible living arrangement, work etc. country in? Currently*


*vaccine hesitancy decreasing work nonprofit work quite developing countries. expecting fully vaccinated late 2022 2023 cases far 2024. still *plenty* people domestically want take vaccine, aren‚Äôt able yet.

No govt going prioritize countries citizens. seems like large problem. better anti vaxxer nutjob. let experts determine whether vaccine responsible spout lies. 

The person question multiple health conditions since people vaccinated, severe events start pop based chance. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* crazy discussion. I'm ready whatever. poke me, baby.  ‚Äúmedical fatphobia‚Äù call it, sure go off. 

Not don‚Äôt think people need address need healthier society, exist. Soon, maybe May-June, stay vigilant keep covid news. vaccine entirely new learning go various variants stack it. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs advisable continue wear masks procede caution. seems vaccines stop deaths, good news itself. I‚Äôm sure eligibility like CA. Seems like states phasing next groups numbers increase fairly substantially. places use cards even 100% agreed on. places forms others keep centralized give out. unique identifiers either way idea would work existing vaccinations. that's valid point, think humans getting callous bad news also inability process large numbers believe places, like NYC, anywhere supply exceeds number available appointments. 

There also waiting list every state anyone sign notified expiring doses due missed appointments. 

It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating seeing states they‚Äôve used &lt;70% supply, yet sticking restrictions moving next phase. actually 3.50. bad. Poor still vaccinate government locations free. reason India need subsidize vaccination middle class above. That's true. Teachers eligible certain high-risk conditions. Nah I‚Äôm talking microchip/population control kind fear. amount reason dig someone hole recognize it‚Äôs problem themself. Thanks luxury choosing would like to. Two weeks *everyone* staying home distancing could, would, stopped virus completely. problem is, point last year entire population country actually done this. Even states highest stay-at-home compliance, large percentage people refuse follow guidance, wear masks, continue gatherings... continued spread virus.

The goalposts moving. Half team actively running ball back virus's end zone. expected higher hope everything going well.  I'm also new paying attention number. One way imagining Robin Williams naked toilet eating bucket KFC...the um...hands on? 1/10th J&amp;J vaccines delivered given (or least added CDC list, could delay). increase quickly. SEND ABROAD! America waste vaccines political posturing world worse precious vials go waste name ""America First"". like closing damp dark basement full mold hoping fixes itself. recommend that, tempting may be. Hey sorry hear that, I'm glad came safe. super normal lingering fears anxieties traumatic experience like that. Today learned India uses different numbering system, cool! People every right concerned certain treatment effective another. battled life-threatening illness survived. doctors provided several different treatments, one varying levels effectiveness and/or side effects. like good ol days! Looks like first approved one collecting. Although wouldn‚Äôt shock find also got first vial trials too. Yeah I'm sure going work. experience far places keeping records 2nd dose purposes others aren't. even using CDC cards. using forms. institutions keeping cards central location vaccinees get keep anyway. 

This sounds like something needed done 5 months ago realistic. depressing. I‚Äôve also read mRNA thought better auto immune issues.


I imagine case case depending youre immunosuppresed. Like op said, consult doctor concerned vaccine right jinx it. think states need expand eligibility. doses coming faster they're administered. I'd like see states reduce minimum age fifty within next couple weeks, maybe even lower. large number doses obviously great thing need actually get arms. agree. think important prioritize initially, administering vaccines several months really think easing eligibility requirements. Thanks laugh... I‚Äôll ask mom Dr. Oz says regards gauge UK variant, transmission. Another hard lockdown (in UK) cases worse first time, higher death rate.

Of course, US said fuck it, lock down, let people die. idea prevalent variant test hospitals.  sure that‚Äôs removed defending someone purely political response. Whatever though. Ouch. made 7-day average jump much, hopefully it‚Äôs way officially recorded go back lowering things. hope. Thanks info! Well yeah time grossly underreporting cases thought IFR could high 10% across demographics.

I remember scary uncertainty, actual numbers.  Doses distributed far doses administered last days that, case now, soon. really game changer make feel better. I‚Äôm still wondering vaccinations aren‚Äôt 24/7 thing? cares much needs paid helps shots get arms. Anything lets us perpetuate ""America bad"" narrative.  took could get, also get level concern around effectiveness variants. Early data seems indicate vaccines effective new variants popping up. People *should* get get, that‚Äôs fair concern wait aren‚Äôt going much anyway. And, entire graph subject vagaries, that's look trends pretend precise timing and/or measures.

.

Most people general population never properly understood statistics. students hate teaching this. great, next step global warming years, good luck us, fellas. I‚Äôm sorry misunderstand you.  meant low individual risk sure, agree.

They 1,000 cases day moment.  general public (under 65) vaccinations won‚Äôt start July.  won‚Äôt done Olympics.  

They also currently 14 day quarantine arrivals banned foreigners countries.

So it‚Äôs big change. do?  Open everyone local vaccination complete? Open Olympic ticket holders?  think it‚Äôd hard politically justify. No, misunderstood saying. giving example people (big city liberals) Abbot care about. cares little whether poor minority communities ability/access get vaccine. wants make sure maximum population old white racist base GOP stays alive, that's one group always vote keep GOP power. Agreed, want us stay severe lockdown rest year Awesome! Hamster-Panda alliance remains strong. sound like reinfection maybe vaccine triggered response causes test positive? daily numbers skew towards beginning week, want see big number, look weekly allocations.

This week CDC says around 6.7 million doses Moderna 8.4 million doses Pfizer allocated.

Let's go already... taking advantage big numbers. Oh wow, don‚Äôt say. wait till tomorrow Texas fix number. high certainty.

Nurses typically embedded units outside cash‚Äôs, cash‚Äôs going bodies are.

You doctors techs clinic crap, nurses aren‚Äôt really role. 

If said Kuwait yeah might admin mildly broken members, Afghanistan Iraq, would CASH. find spicy Thai ones pretty awesome, seem pretty hard find though, least area. feel like we‚Äôre flooding system vaccines. I‚Äôm really nervous quickly get used expire. Yea know long term effects covid even low risk people. going gamble vs vaccine probably near 0 percent chance long term effects ? Never underestimate VA's ability fuck something up.

That said, hope works out. Asymptomatic spreaders still thing too. reason people keep forgetting that. likely safe, slight chance get it, like mild case, probably even notice. I've read literally opposite lately? Good you. MIL gave whole family COVID came ahead daughters birth bothered wear mask quarantine prior travel. horrible experience wife give birth sick there.

You're proactive better mistake made. Millions, Cletus. Billions. Millions billions I'm sure. whole pandemic really fucked geopolitical situation America. Lots formerly left-leaning people hate Cuomo Newsom wish lived Texas Florida. Likewise overton window authortiarianism shifted far point mandatory vaccines, nationwide lockdowns, contact tracing normal ideas.

Like literally wedge issues America, thing that's certain made left hate right even more, made right hate left even more. Mine too. eagerly await 2nd appointment. Moderna Pfizer 6-9% effective south african variant long term effects ""appear"". would seeing short term effects already first months. That's high level explained scientist working vaccine development. early part winter bad, steep drop started early January. January 8th 300k new cases, end January 130k/day, end February 50k/day. 

Obviously hoax, cannot deny immediate shifting narrative came Biden's victory. true throughout crisis. Trump's campaign rallies regularly criticized summer potential superspreader events, BLM protests especially victory crowds immediately election not. 

I get double standard exists, extent, glad happened. kind reporting necessary get people motivated vote Trump. still double standard precedent sets regarding press political influence troubling. that's based Chinese system, Japanese one! Oh, talking r/conservative! one effectively delivering vaccine. feel like idiot I‚Äôve consistently politely smiled wearing mask whole time. still can‚Äôt shake it. least maybe means I‚Äôll better eventually take masks.

But I‚Äôll go back checking food stuck teeth again. international travel. US enough vaccine take care US adults year rest world not. around 25% Americans swearing never vaccinated plus 16s trials needing finished vaccinated (**if** parents willing) could people bring things cause illness misery unless something like plus testing international travelers groups countries working developing so-called vaccine passports aimed allowing travel. airlines fear smattering regional credentials cause confusion none widely crucial establish uniform guidance"" ‚Äúthe U.S. must leader development,‚Äù two dozen groups said letter Monday White House coronavirus-response coordinator Jeff Zients. However, groups said vaccination requirement domestic international groups include main U.S. international airline trade organizations, airline labor unions U.S. Chamber Commerce. White House immediately World Health Organization United Nations' aviation arm working type information include credential. airline industry groups particularly interested U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention take leading role, believing would increase certainty information credentials legitimate. Pre-covid, average 300,000 butt-in-seat air miles year. Since March 28, 2020 I've flown 0. 

Not gonna lie, I'm jealous. Doesn‚Äôt make threats less awful. could Israel [testing US might lot undernotified cases. USA Today article talking trials, relative real world almost cases (Israel sees probably 4x cases every day right trials combined saw several months). larger sample, Israel seeing things trials capable detecting due limited size. 

The notion 100% protection hospitalization trial translating real world always specious. trials big enough long enough determine severe outcomes happen small portion time. 10 vaccinated people trial catch COVID severe outcomes, could expect simply random chance. nearly 5K people catch Israel's real-world data, would expect severe disease, happened 271 them. 330 Million people country loss 500 K isn‚Äôt end world civilization sad may . Consider closing FB account. 5 years ago life dramatically improved - relationships.  Janssen belgian, apparently Jannsen vaccine dutch company got rebranded got acquired J&amp;J. closed systems, yes. every system open, know not, necessarily hold. Further, greater spread greater possibility mutations, we're seeing mutations higher infectivity higher mortality rates. again, trying say things would've evened US fewer lockdown measures empirically false. California experienced ridiculous unsustainable levels growth long time. growth slowed recently, republicans trying spin sort ""gotcha"". course. point **We're getting herd immunity.**

It's happening right front us. overall case rate dropping like crazy since early January cannot attributed vaccinations alone. two factors working quite effectivly, despite media says. Honestly, I‚Äôm biased want go Japan summer miss much girlfriend lives there. (Luckily able come America summer it‚Äôs big deal) it‚Äôs annoying I‚Äôd much rather go Japan. don‚Äôt understand Japan‚Äôs deal this. can‚Äôt vaccinate vulnerable population time? can‚Äôt allow vaccinated tourists ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù locations? (America July) They‚Äôve problem putting people risk Go Travel campaigns, won‚Äôt let tourists statistically safe? mean said probably fine. pumpkin king 

How dare you?? Jack Skellington actually cared citizens Halloweentown. VA 65 qualifying health conditions essential workers since January 18th... got many registrations day Fairfax county still processing people signed third day- pharmacies like CVS restricted still sign ups directly them- sent vaccinated county/state you‚Äôre younger also gotten sick trip Lego Land. Better spend money otherwise use tickets gift shop brand new lego set Walmart. monkeys paw wish less Fauci TV would mean Osterholm Feigl-Ding interviews around clock. It‚Äôs that. fucking privileged real hardship comes, covid real hardship, shit bed. idea deal conditions people health care workers deal daily DECADES. Like think nurses Congo luxury downtime dealing Ebola? HCWs India‚Äôs slums deal 2 million TB cases every year. docs nurses try deliver medicine Haiti, Yemen Syria?

Honestly better build resiliency COVID beginning climate change really hits fan won‚Äôt HCWs left Go (slowly...) keep going Last Tuesday 54k cases reported. Hopefully get today  hope prosecutor somewhere political cojones what's right start throwing Newsmax OANN staff jail. they're already crime US law.

Fingers crossed back Labor Day weekend. cases USA still dropping what? nyt tracker usually use data anomaly today. get part, getting increasing replication rate I'm sure increase severity infection. 

I know I'm missing something I've found elementary error bunch doctors somehow missed, trying understand works. douche memory... reason? get vaccinated fine, feel comfortable go. world never never 100% safe even mask. Unless there‚Äôs still low level covid around employers want get people back office again. could see employers start requiring it. people partisan/edgy.

Objectively, Florida showing gated communities give vaccines great thing. Why? everyone lives fucking 70 years old.

Get shots arms risk, even offends easily offended.  I'm already anticipating ""health documentation processing fee"" tacked ticket prices. Yes! got second shot today, plans stop wearing mask anytime soon. far less likelihood getting COVID (and even do, far less likely serious), believe still enough testing done show likely fully vaccinated individual give virus someone else. children still alive would irked little. mention kids comment brought memories daughter. thank that. Enjoy 1/2 victory, deserve it. Florida lying data whole time. misleading? raw data.

You draw conclusions it. Lol hope neighbors responsible getting vaccinated went window year ago.

It's clear half population give damn anyone else, least quarter get vaccine all.

Under circumstances, I'm going go ahead protect myself. I've protected enough spending year quarantined sheltering place partying spreading covid around.

If every neighbor acted like past year covid exist... I'll wait however long takes get mRNA (which probably month options worst). line thinking seriously sells short insane amount r&amp;d went developing vaccines. even one vaccines chance dangerous long-term effects, would willing bet people working would caught lab, well ever reached market. once-in-a-lifetime opportunity free publicity goodwill pharmaceutical companies working vaccine, would remarkably stupid release vaccine potential unknown effects public risk hit reputation years come. assume overlap two- 1-1 adders Chicagoan here. I'm blown away response Pritzker et all, course residents. huge city like get numbers much one coldest February streaks decades truly astounding something proud of. would assume may it, we‚Äôre asymptomatic.

My girlfriend reactions first Pfizer shots sore arm. second shots opposite - weather 72 hours (with fever, fatigue, chills, aches, etc) whereas girlfriend quicker recovery time (48 hours). 

If didn‚Äôt reactions time injection shortly thereafter, you‚Äôre fine. Based reply, earlier say ""We wear masks around unvaccinated everyone wants vaccine get one.""

1) seems made fast, concerned potential cutting corners. time went felt comfortable.

2) concerned long term effects.

There‚Äôs point restricting vulnerable point. Israel's deaths/capita higher US? fully vaccinated almost 50% population 50% basically everyone vulnerable. 

Can't explain discrepancy... Well, hospitals writing anyone COVID without positive COVID test, goes influenza.

But quite possible many people would gotten flu normal year got COVID instead.

And also possible flu harder time spreading public health measures recovering one virus (COVID) makes immune viruses period time.

The real answer probably combination many factors. lack flu year real. lived settlement without npcs ""Hoard"" Jesus christ, stolen, tax payers footed bill.

I'm sorry uncle, however, can't make decisions harm millions wish prevention few. Probably mix flu really quite bit less lethal people, dont think huge number flu deaths written honestly, maybe small number ""U.S. COVID-19 Vaccine Administration Vaccine Type"". Yeah, thats happened. sound almost like people said covid would disappear election day hoax.

This winter really bad covid deaths. looked single chart? Nope. Many pharmacies offer free, $10. Hell, actually got mine free last year, gave $5 gift card too! someone got first dose Moderna yesterday, THIS! see many studies Pfizer someone needs figure heck need worry about, lol.  idea Israel's COVID numbers / capita higher US's past two weeks, even though 3 times vaccination numbers arguably restrictions US?

I can't wrap mind around it... likely guys already it. worry much second shot. Ask mom knows it. says yes it‚Äôs fake. legitimate plan way could president direct responsibility states everything. Yes technically thing do, honest goal provide robust vaccination guidelines logistics, write letter saying ""figure out"". Yeah, hasn‚Äôt picnic either. protected health year now, I‚Äôm raise white flag expose covid CDC needs give vaccine fence sitters reasons get vaccinated. 

America enough vaccines everyone within months.

Do realize America dealt seasonal breakouts polio 50 years got vaccine? way, live Florida. Businesses 100% open, big counties simply ask people wear mask. Fair. 

Do see might feel icky healthy people CDC dangle front vaccinated kind reward? doesn‚Äôt even honestly explicitly state it‚Äôs ok healthy people getting covid, unhealthy. concern opposite. People see majority vacced decide it‚Äôs necessary get whatever reason. Vaccinating citizens first isn‚Äôt hoarding. Keeping need hoarding. get point start asking questions. (We won‚Äôt, health officials recognize doses valuable arms global citizens sitting American shelves.) feel like early controversy covid deaths people upset death counted covid death person cancer covid, instance.

Look around, what's already happening. believe still paying 9/11 fee something extent almost 20 years later. Actually Brazil two vaccines testing. again, think knew that. Totally agree many possible getting jab, sure. question. yeah, someone condition taking meds def important make sure get right one. That‚Äôs sick joke made burst laughing like child. correct, yesterday 2.7 million J&amp;J Administered reported. means 600k new J&amp;J reported today. 6.2 Million new doses Pfizer Moderna reported today Thx see Thursday. March 2: 391K doses administered


March 9: 120K doses administered there? always thought smoking supressed hunger Yup! Actually, spite Trump, medical community scraped roughest part.

.

Trump threw stumbling blocks way whole time office. word turns crocodile? /s realize there's control groups measure effectiveness Covid measures right?

Florida restrictive measures since July around 1400 deaths per million residents. California extremely restrictive measures since April around 1300 deaths per million residents.

How reconcile two states wildly different restrictions, one none, one strictest lockdown country, less ended place, conclude restrictive measures what's caused Covid numbers much higher? **24037644** doses given far. Who's angry? me.

So make feel better compare half million dead Americans projected estimate believe ""complete bullshit"", works you?

That sounds contradictory. utopist, always find angry people society lol reality US lived 9/11 everyday months awareness prevention like real terrorist attack happened.

Because terrorists touched city world finance, New York, medias politics freaking out.

But population die virus pandemy, they're giving shit force go work school anyway... stupid mf wear mask... 

Even whole population less significant two/three buildings NYC feel little weather...i still happy got vaccine. means vaccine working. kind reaction I'd worry maybe vaccine dud immune response weaker. media completely done 180? vaccine approved kids.. want us do? Experiment developing bodies? can't consent. fair point, occurred replied. like cousin &amp; family San Angelo -- 6 peeps family 7 got COVID back December. (I say ""their fault"" Cuzz's wife preschool teacher &amp; allowed teach remotely)

so, got COVID, one severely enough need one night hospital. 90+ days ago, they're getting vaccinated. terms whether ever got officially tested, honestly know. previous exposure &amp; vaccine, they're counting toward herd immunity  O:-) [University Maryland Medical first incase one wants click. one quote cloth masks. 

‚ÄúMask Safety Effectiveness
Myth: Cloth masks protect you.
Fact: Cloth face masks effective. create barrier mouth nose around you. makes difficult droplets spread coronavirus coughs, sneezes talking reach people.
Cloth masks mainly keep unknowingly spreading disease others, studies indicate may help protect large droplets serve indirect reminder avoid touching face. 
This wearing cloth mask inside retail stores public transportation mandatory Maryland since April 2020. services getting haircut eating restaurant allowed, important ever continue wearing mask. We're together.‚Äù

EDIT: Forgot [Mayo Clinic masks

A cloth mask intended trap respiratory droplets released wearer talks, coughs sneezes. also acts barrier protect wearer inhaling droplets released others.

The effective cloths masks made multiple layers tightly woven fabric like cotton. mask layers stop droplets getting mask escaping it.‚Äù There's huge overlap people smoke, obese, think COVID overblown wear masks. Hmmmmm..... wonder changed? optimism actually better via Surplus? Yet can‚Äôt get one variant grow become predominant one that's circulating without leading increase cases. also noticed general change tone media coverage Covid. think lot outlets felt need really play bad things means get people vote. necessary evil, still accurate representation reality. 

After election inauguration, could play bit.  6 weeks I‚Äôll fully vaccinated body ready arm sore today lol Robert Frost confused I've heard snowbirds. anyone done article it? find strings unfunny puns mark interesting news stories Reddit also irritating way. Got J&amp;J Saturday 10 AM. 12 hours later uncontrollable shivers body aches I‚Äôve never experienced before. Sunday little better end day situation night before. Yesterday worked 4 hours went home early slept 15 hours straight. day 4 I‚Äôm back normal arm still super soar. worth it. know post saying good news fucking time giving ignorant people reasons go without face masks. give us info get shots instead fueling experts predictions 4th wave people saw good news want leave quarantining practices. posts nice time detrimental towards society consensus serious virus is. [GOOD NEWS No, access opinion. VDH even appear making half-assed attempt reach minority communities. black, hispanic, asian populations almost exactly half white population normalized population sizes, hard come conclusion institutional rasicm. say lily white person. I'm sorry that's horrible. guys get this, I'm sure guys get anything Yeah need start working breathing mouth anymore. Since masks on, less defaulted breathing mouth since one see lol.

Might good time whiten teeth Texas natural disaster going on. Vaccines get second place that.... It‚Äôs year. trust quickly flu vaccine made every year combat different strains, trust mRna made quickly. mRNA vaccines made studied quite time general coronaviruses (not Covid specifically), Covid mRNA adaption ongoing vaccine. ""thresholds"" hard limits. Take WA state instance, nobody knows hell next phase is. largely Inslee's gut feeling point. OK, explain me, using real world result US, restrictions resulted lowered hospitalization/death metric notable would justify destructions inherent lockdown... Fellow Georgia people here, unlikely college students getting vaccine May-ish? saw we're one worst states terms distribution, that's pretty annoying see They're extremely similar I'd probably apply news What's really hilarious money (Gen- X/older millenials) could ignore effects Covid-19 travel state lazy restrictions. 

But kids/families allowed least things like senior prom/trips outside socially distanced.   ok 80 % world population thx answer best news ages!

I worried while. Thanks posting this! won‚Äôt fully effective April 10th take 2 weeks take full effect. conclusion- 85x cases detected massive pool undetected/asymptomatic cases population. 

No future study came anywhere near level much debate statistical methods used extrapolate small regional sampling arrive 85x number. end day, headline mutated into, ""Millions experience time travel!!!"" Well technically, make it, keep it. saying it‚Äôs unethical bit stretch. Immoral maybe. thing though. Contract$$$$ logistic$ nightmare work doctor refuses wear mask exercise proper social distancing measures public.

Being doctor preclude dipshit partisan hack.

You know call guy graduated medical school bottom class? ""Doctor"". elementary, middle highschool town letting students (if want to) come back full time starting second week April. Students still virtual want. Kind cluster bring back change home room teachers two months also glad see normality return. get worries come from, taking account advantages vaccinated, like allowed gather private without masks social distancing. create peer pressure vaccinated, one friends group vaccinated, likely change mind. 

And also remember pandemic worlwide. US end vaccine surplus, simply lift export ban (even bit) allow countries vaccinate faster. reduce likelyness new variants appearing, good thing absolutely everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, surplus vaccine doses global pandemic first world problem i've ever heard life lol. think I‚Äôm gonna start saving take vacation Florida summer lol Yeah, same, change N95 US gov certification, KN95 Chinese FFP2 EU certification. So, no, then. article. Thanks condescending unproductive discussion.

I PhD biology, 15 years big pharma, main project discussion clinical guys whether try covid therapeutic. I'm reading everything topic, work, nothing offer. 

All said, I'll ask third time: anyone link showing prevalent immunity that's behavior, please send me, might actually help someone unlike u/ganner. We're vaccinating anyone 45 today 2MM+. Theu government's aim 7MM+ near future per day. would awesome we're able achieve it. Yeah. They're definitely fan extra-caution... providers give shit. I've seen anyone check paperwork hospital vaccine sites. first round front line staff nursing home residents got shots one gave shit. doses present arm got it. Oh drove grandma get it? Great, getting it, sit down.

It's shots arms, right initial million. Since May Ahh I'm idiot. Kids don‚Äôt contribute much death toll You‚Äôre bottle sunshine, huh?   Nah. would weird forced. lift restrictions let people choose. Wow, really garbage poster. 

Goodbye. Blocked. Lol, put photo CDC vaccination card profile. vaccines started rolled December case numbers started dropping January, Biden took office. I‚Äôm saying Trump anything right turn around, recent good news *not* new president. imagine psychopath ineptly handled virus, killing hundreds thousands people without concern, becoming case study lead nation pandemic.

oh wait, don‚Äôt imagine it, happened. Neither lol, [its post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

This definitely happen, regardless get another wave cases. people responsibly vast majority deaths also gotten vast majority vaccinations. 

But very, large portion country level protection natural immunity vaccinations combined, vaccinations ramping way are... see possibly anything minor, short term increase cases.

In regard, faith America... actively rely previous failures automatically project us future one. Good luck. Everything I've seen ""long haulers"" anecdotal best. sure idea got invited say considering *we* invited (friends great friends wouldnt shocked hadnt invited) assume people got invited showed up. Lots old people, even pregnant women. wedding rural Florida groom wore jeans imagine type crowd was... Perfect way spread around vaccine-resistant variants evolve.

Im quite confident incorrect. chicken Coronaviruses evolution vaccine resistance ongoing problem vaccination program. nothing chicken Coronaviruses would allow evolve vaccine resistance also apply Covid. Additionally evolution vaccine resistance primarily evolving avoid immune responses, makes virus anything, dangerous. ends exactly wanted be, hypothetically, significant vaccine? Cloth masks fine, OP omitted part article title stating cloth masks infective HEALTHCARE WORKERS. guess people willing get vaccinated? even halfway people eligible this. [I laid details post Way edgy. It‚Äôs attractive. kids? vaccine available children. husband taken extremely seriously daughter dying get out. reliable links would helpful. Well that‚Äôs partially true you‚Äôre missing segment population, ones invited declined. parents showed masked baby shower weren‚Äôt masked.... people risk averse didn‚Äôt show up.


It‚Äôs like going church saying average American loves going church based people talk to. lead paragraph:

 many reasons excited three COVID-19 vaccines getting arms across United States. top list extremely high level safety protection SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus causes COVID-19. course, data come clinical trials rigorously conducted optimal research conditions. One might wonder well impressive clinical trial results translate real world. Thanks nuanced...wait wasn‚Äôt you! news outlets getting interviews head Sinovac? Even want take ridiculous, insane point view, we've directly compensated via stimulus checks, way. even lens insane person, still objectively wrong. Thank you! fact sounds comforting, I‚Äôm hoping research soon. Thanks again! don‚Äôt think people genuinely concerned roped Karens. would doctor know actually flu get test? can't test someone flu they're office, prescribe tamiflu unless know someone flu positive. 


As people would've mentioned, sensible thing would recommend going urgent care, scheduling day appointment different doctor availability. 


Frankly though, Tamiflu great medicine anyway. feel like could even simpler study indicates - pollen high people cough sneeze more, spreading droplets. hospitalizations deaths two numbers I'm paying attention anymore. averages continued trend downward even spikes overall cases. We'll always cases. want prevent minimize severe illness death. sense humor. Yeah looked now. Full lockdown apparently useful unless hospitals overcapacity, otherwise simply needed.
However....people need put damn masks...they can't even get right, hard people. Yes. curious number poster mind COVID deaths. don‚Äôt understand thinking. view

So view world completely wrong multiple levels. Got it. hope right, zero faith America's ability avoid another wave right now. hope cut mortality rate next wave. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt way shine light inside body disinfect it?‚Äù. compensated dealing fucking epic example failure. work travel industry, really think boomer vacations going save travel industry? help select areas it. customers huge mix ages, able reopen till wider travel again, airlines earn enough money limited customer base, lifeline us. like last summer government Denmark came announcement ""ease concerns tourism industry"" turned opening boarders 3 nearby countries entire summer. screwed majority Danish travel industry enough people run businesses, benefitted Germans owned holidays homes here, holiday homes already getting increased demands due ""staycations"".

So helping us. faster vaccine roll-out (Fuck EU rollout) alternative options like negative quick-test results allow unvaccinated travel safer things help us right now. shooting guns? said correct. yes also obviously follows fewer 92 million Americans fully vaccinated. one-in-50,000 chance dying COVID catch it, vaccines start rolling fall return classes. really something overly concerned with.  chart abomination. someone CDC studied best practices data visualization...then chose exact opposite every recommendation. remember time star wars movie bad got poor reviews. Disney blamed russian troll bots bad reviews lmao. mean state-department spokesperson? think countries open anyway.

We can't lose another year tourism. TIL balls cancer Yea, cause everyone followed rules time. 

But seriously, didn‚Äôt even escape plan then. do. Let‚Äôs wrap shit up. Correction. I'm ~~an idiot~~ **mistaken**. right.

You get bonus points able accept new info, *not* idiot. :) say 4 5 months saying thing 4 5 months ago. I'm also class 2020 honestly feel like I'm still high school ended high school online bedroom started college exact place. feel terrible class 2021 too, know schools already cancelled prom senior events. 

Since hospitalizations going everywhere many high-risk people vaccinated, really think hold normal end-of-year events. even sad current seniors miss prom graduation year online school people sacrificed year already vaccinated back normal. Today first day truly believe almost fully behind us Memorial Day.

What feeling. I‚Äôm parent teenagers there‚Äôs question generation really suffering result schools activities closed, look everyone wearing mask. sucks.

I wish article would mentioned *something* real health impact COVID-19 people‚Äînot older people‚Äîwho never get sick enough show stats deaths even hospitalizations. Long COVID real, miserable horrific reality probably millions Americans right now. includes lot young people twenties used athletic barely make flight stairs without feeling like going collapse.

It deserves least part discussion balancing risks. (fully vaccinated) parents moved neighborhood amazing much easier lives gotten, instant. work more, actually go date, take time relax - grandparents wonderful. least, good ones are. year life gone, boi gonna pay it. Lol go again. over, hope people take good, long look put everyone through. hope people consider shutdowns anything absolute last-resort policy seriously dangerous diseases, first line defense every novel disease comes up.

Part wonders we're gonna repeat next swine flu-like pandemic. ü•á they're basically testing whether side effects serious effects covid, kids? (Not I've heard serious side effects, seems like sort thing that's normally tested drugs) Netherlands, icu usage also creeping slowly up. Death less half peak second wave, impact health care remains severe. got antibodies, I‚Äôll put anybody. need go back many years. Many people live like today world, think something it. WEIRD cultures norm all. That‚Äôs state governments work would guessed, shithole afterall Evonik producing anything commercial quantity Germany second half year...

""Lipids, unsung COVID-19 vaccine component, get investment"" Even hanging group non-vaccinated people? Ordered vaccines =/= getting concern under-16 crowd can't get it. may small percentage population, place time. That's scary. I‚Äôm boat. try stay positive people vaccinated, lower chance catching someone waiting turn. Jeepers, casual. thought meaning clear. side effects seem occur randomly, far, far know, correlation found would explain people side effects get sore arm like shot. Gotta make sure use vaccines stole us, huh Italy? Hmm interesting. know nothing production viral vector vaccines. read papers mRNA ones, waaay easier produce. basically printed out. simple elegant. yeah, would love hear someone knowledgable viral vectors. states putting prohibitively difficult restrictions place? tomorrow join club! love Joe Biden, one thing like boring lol first time felt hopeful, don‚Äôt crush it. 


;) mutates far slower

doesn't really. mutates 1/4 rate per base pair 1/2 rate per whole genome. exoribonuclease proofreading also causes recombination well, influenza do, bit wash they're pretty comparable. know way, way many people decided getting vaccine. infuriates kids young get they're putting risk. Let make clear, one ever changer there‚Äôs stance topic internet debate know say guys big lymph nodes Scary. hope Europe‚Äôs vaccination program needs kick high gear. Lots potential risk higher infections. Cure mode much realistic. kills like X amount people X amount time, lose Yes, give data behavior medical status. could possibly go wrong?  worry got little something brewing northern Russia. White rich communities taking advantage available doses lower Income areas less. 

What cause answer debate that‚Äôs truth. says production start July

Does it? Oh, ok. 

I doubt Italy would agree participate publicity stunt like that. still case people world vaccinated 2021, vaccine doses always plus. need look malicious intent company agreeing produce doses vaccine. Ask pediatrician? Yeah third vaccine. Unles you‚Äôre playing cure mode Age, probably undercounting deaths, less obesity, there's theories ""stronger immune systems"" given widespread exposure disease, might legs America FUCK YEAH!!!!! Here‚Äôs know would happy someone knowledgeable step in...

One first steps producing vaccine like Sputnik AZ/Oxford make TONS VIRUS JUICE via growing virus special reactors. need specific ‚Äòquality‚Äô ‚Äòquantity‚Äô virus delicious soup else can‚Äôt used start over. 

AZ overestimated ability produce virus everyone wants careful. Reading tou post histort idea youre talking lol yeah, hand American folks losing everything communist regime installed Joe Biden Kamala.

 


my Texas friend texted saying government took half drum kit, leaving snare, one ride cymbal one Tom. hihats. Shit's crazy, man. (Reuters) - number people treated French intensive care units (ICUs) COVID-19 reached 14-1/2-week-high Monday, 3,849, total hospitalisations disease increased second day running, 25,195. Illustrating stress French health system, medical authorities greater Paris region - accounts roughly one-sixth French population - ordered hospitals cancel 40% planned normal activity make space COVID-19 patients critical condition. additional 359 people died disease, pushing total 88,933, world‚Äôs seventh-highest toll. far states either goals removing restrictions opening entirely immediately. CDC could help here, haven't. No...it 2-3 weeks tops messaging risk (old) stay home...

We‚Äôve known almost year survival rate 60 like 99.9999%...

Isolate risk, let society get it...

I don‚Äôt mean disparage parents teaching skills, shudder thought next generation lost education wise...the ramifications year+ long shut felt decades... say Auckland Wellington. said mainland NZ. 
But want pedantic, Queenstown closer Sydney Auckland Wellington are. Christchurch. Christchurch also closer Hobart Sydney, closer Hobart Auckland Sydney. LOL, persistent stagflation likely outcome sharp increase spending. Think 70s instead 20s. learnt bad was. Remember new thing back 2020 Jan. Chinese new year. Imagine Christmas season 1 hospital like Tennessee reported cluster 10 cases new lung disease. Would government give serious thought locking whole state?

Hell, Many US states continued lockdowns mask wearing basically means piece cloth nose even chin. 

My point is, easy accuse China harder lockdown earlier hindsight, moment, people knew impact economic impact would made government think twice full lockdown. Pfizer, Israeli results show protection sets 2 weeks (next nothing prior) slowly ramps second shot. full protection happens week 2cond shot.

It shows 1 dose 2 weeks provide protection, far full, 60+ individual highly recommended stay cautious till week 2cond shot. 

Here data entirety February Israeli fatalities:

 

\- 935 COVID deaths February.

\- 553 unvaccinated.

\- 240 1 dose (so 1 3 weeks 1st dose, 2 unprotected yet).

\- 142 deaths 1st week 2cond dose.

\- **0 deaths 1 week second waited year, weeks. Agreed, however unfortunately development production severely delayed, meaningful deliveries anywhere Q3 never said would ineffective, article. again, say, know, simply say know. obviously feel otherwise unencumbered comes making answers. Seriously, rest lives? Really, that's going with? 

NO ONE KEEPING KIDS INSIDE REST LIVES! hell right mind would that. couple years lives going kill them.

Say develop kind social inability anxiety, guess what? parent help way ways possibly can. 

I asking question get shit trying keep child safe based husband believe. asked reliable links, something believe provided. 

Offer still table. Send link. Give something believe happily read youtube video facebook post. Restrictions lifted around country FINALLY fabled J&amp;J vaccines!  ""ignorant people"" written ""willfully ignorant people"".

.

In career, always able ""teach"" ignorant, willfully ignorant different challenge.  (My last comment got deleted including link) Look vaccine polls around world. America far outlier hesitancy, even among developed nations. Nah need feel better it, is, virus gonna virus. I'm going kid think piece cloth loosely fitting face would stop virus tracks. like country covid deaths. Shit like happen live high population density areas.

I'm lucky live area like that. Tbh, aside seeing masks handwash station entrance local hardware store, really much different.  Hospitals overwhelmed, people safe trying still live life.

Overall feel like good test run pandemic actually super deadly. know would take lot serious posed larger risk I'm going engage someone resorts name calling bolster argument. I‚Äôve started telling friends scared vaccine covid, something fundamentally wrong way perceive danger life."
