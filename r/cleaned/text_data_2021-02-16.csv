0,2021-02-16," Japanese. Well...the expats stuck Japan anyway. People kind ragging I'm boat. get JnJ now, get one mRNA vaccines later? They've already said get either first dose Pfizer Moderna need second dose vaccine. something I've thought made question want JnJ. probably fine, know answer get JnJ first get mRNA months later safely interact negatively way? Someone smarter me, feel free explain. dismissing OP's fears help something others thinking about.

If Moderna &amp; Pfizer make boosters, young population privy get choice either?

Like ok... wanted stay inside ruin mental health year put last list vaccine. I'm probably gonna pushed vaccine whose mechanism impress much I'm sure options later line. Like get way, feels ""shut say get choice matter"" actually do?

I actually think JnJ would better suited lot populations hard time going two vaccine appointments like homeless people, etc. Anyway, wait month two mRNA vaccine I'll probably one answer questions. No, said found CLEAR evidence, preliminary investigation.

Why ommitting this? reward system holding hostage make perfect sense though. We're little bit nationalistic. get free choice would indeed choose BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine, I'm proud invented Germany (and I'm even german, live here). able get moderna one, mind, good. 
However, AZ working less well, that's opinion, that's fact. that's caused EU, that's caused technology behind it. Everyone world, excepts british maybe, would prefer mRNA ones Oxf/AZ. 

Ultimately, course getting free choice many months come, I'll probably end getting AZ one. also take it, lot better nothing all, also get medical personal moment happy left inferior product. course main reason suddenly german newspapers publishing articles really still good vaccine all. great line, I‚Äôm stealing it. üòÇ Rough calc, every 17 days there‚Äôs lockdown worldwide, 5 million lifetimes worth hours lost. Granted it‚Äôs hard make direct comparison people made lockdowns main personality trait net figures well. John Hopkins tracker says 27 million cases. country second India 11 million. That‚Äôs approximately 40% less cases US total also 316% total population. 

India astronomically higher population density too. US population density 35.71 people per sq kilometer. India population density approximately 382 people per square mile. statisticians there, that‚Äôs increase roughly 969.7% terms population density. 

How make logical sense? I‚Äôm anti masker anything all, live Arkansas see probably do. I‚Äôm confused fuck. 

Did US handle poorly double cases country second cases, also population density 900% higher them? different reason numbers? I‚Äôm honestly floored anyone smarter could give little info I‚Äôd greatly appreciate it. already covid though likely immune? Agreed. I'm immunosuppressants, thankfully near end dose (week 7 8) got second shot. High fever, chills, headache, nausea/stomach cramping, muscle aches, joint aches. told fianc√© I'd rather hospital bowel obstruction again. half asleep, brushed hand back mistake thought poked muscles hurt much. actually yelled much hurt. 

Super glad extreme reaction. 10/10 would repeat get COVID. still ruled US faking moon landing MKUltra. Obviously. chilean Spanish general already indecipherable lol It‚Äôs WHO. Virologists look forensics DNA dismissed lab leak theory. that‚Äôs genetics works. Also, clear yet data AZ vaccine less effective anything symptomatic infection. good diet really great schedule. Gone shit. losing 2 pounds week grades straight As. Gone shit cause need eat feel similar shit Mutations may complicate things, bottom line we‚Äôre mostly vaccinated, I‚Äôm gonna continue living like this. Mutants damned. ‚Äúthe day before‚Äù danger? aware runs country, right? ultimate control gets shared doesn't?

And take Daszak face value. [serious conflict regard Wuhan lab connections PRC general. Yep. Cant wait Can,t find exact source, read Moderna 2-3 times mRNA per dose pfizer. Hence, makes sense hits harder (maybe unnecessary hard) pfizer. I‚Äôve lost sense smell taste covid. wouldn‚Äôt wish worst enemy. Boy makes feel like wimp. live Seattle, I'm 25 years younger her, live 2 miles pharmacy missed appointment Saturday snow. One thing I've seen one people stadium Phoenix, really tiring many vaccinations. said hands hurt every shift fact NZ continuing lockdown proves right. clock government go pub really intrusive damn restriction Density? No, see North Dakota. 

Island? No, see China, Vietnam &amp; Thailand. lady doesn‚Äôt even look 70. healthy active looking! Corn. much corn. cases extremely rare. personally havent read cases much news. Almost reinfections (also rare) milder symptoms.

There also chances false positive PCR taken account studying rarities. biggest city tiny 4 million island nation completely shutting prediction knowledge lockdown fucks sake

And it‚Äôs normal lol, link showing foreign language, presumable dutch, thanks though! moon doesnt exist earth flat God, hope. Agree. However, moderna vaccines produced Lonza Switzerland, EU. information. think past two days artificially low due deep freeze engulfing half country? (That said, numbers definitely dropped ton since early Jan fantastic.) LOL. Good luck that. **Coronavirus family prime suspect previous Aren‚Äôt half regular population showing signs depression? Well could always baby boom something haha Second study: confirms antibodies maintained majority people 3 months. Important note tested saliva instead blood. I‚Äôm sure tests reliable blood tests. think faster.

The studies read, go even longer 3 months. So: don‚Äôt know. shit eh? I'm regretting life choices got BMI 39.

I've working daily last several months slowly decreasing. cannot decrease risk COVID fast enough. I'm going go back way things were, want.  Must tough. Hopefully warmer weather country's vaccination program bring return normality soon. Biden talking 100 Million yesterday. remember 1 million day inauguration? roll going fine previous administration. Biden done things better, 100 Million stupid puffery. Sometimes? That‚Äôs way walk time. one Eeek E484K variant also found S. African variant allows reinfect makes current vaccines less effective. common would noticed sooner infections. UK probably best world sequencing around 10% positive tests top anyone else. Hope countries resources start catching make sure difficult variants area &amp; actually enforce protective measures like masking &amp; distancing finally enact first time slow spread. Yeah, pro mitigation efforts throughout followed rules also think need try get back ""normal"" best reach reasonable threshold terms vaccinations positivity / death rates. I'm sure specific number think governors mayors gradually rolling things back next 6-12 months (depending long takes get seems like safe level longer require masks indoor places). 

Keeping mitigation efforts, least people that, level past 10 months mentally socially healthy. 

That said, mutation arises vaccines effective results similar death rates worse, obviously changes things. Hopefully vaccines, particularly mRNA ones, handle mutations fine. surprise; deaths follow exposure frequencies. 

stop transmission = stop pandemic.

12 week lockdown now! Yeah. following news, heard numbers actually show things getting better. Pfizer Price Phister merged called Pfizer Phister It‚Äôs satire. He‚Äôs reckless leaving home age, frank. can‚Äôt accept reality, doesn‚Äôt mean accept you. lost 'if people read full article '. hell problem? read?

That much free time, eh? Sad. two months summer months. months last time one got infected in. We'll fineish wish job. Like old times. colonials return. Next Christmas actually 2022, means could carry 2023 potential 2024 lockdown extension looming.

Just kidding. really said ‚Äúthis Christmas‚Äù. Thanks quick answer. guess 2. done short period time infection active?
Follow-up question: know pfizer/moderna phase 3 trials protocol place track many participants still ended getting infected, asymptomatic?

Mandatory comment: I‚Äôm 100% pro-vaccine can‚Äôt wait get it, I‚Äôm trying make argument it! Actually American vaccine exports banned population vaccinated. choice rely exports Europe till üëÜüëÜüëÜ

Could imagine wrote seasonal flu way? ‚ÄúScientists detect another recombination H1N1 March. kill you? knows?!?‚Äù think 2 got faster reviews, submitted data much faster. J&amp;J waited evaluate data first sending review. Pfizer/Moderna sent data soon ready reviewed concurrently FDA did. 

It took month data submission approval two. seems like faster data released right approval, data already reviewed releasing. J&amp;J reviewed released data first.  We'll vaccinated Europe hits 50%. Cope. Thanks,

it's reassuring know infant death may may related covid.

## South Africa receives first shipment single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

 

South Africa received first shipment Johnson &amp; Johnson¬†Covid-19 vaccine, country's health minister announced Tuesday, putting target become first world administer shot.¬†

Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said Twitter South Africa¬†had secured total 9 million doses the¬†Johnson¬†&amp;¬†Johnson vaccine, first delivery containing 80,000 long stay locked shouldnt dependent upon even handful people waiting vaccine. think you‚Äôre overreacting. you‚Äôre able willing that, would probably wait then. lot people can‚Äôt afford want live way longer fine ‚Äúsettling‚Äù J&amp;J. Nothing wrong either camp. Cigarettes used somewhat similar. took decades fighting things mention circumstantial evidence though. Coronaviruses exist wild, nearest relative Yunnan, know viruses mutate. ridiculous make conclusion based that. find intermediate animal host, natural zoonosis speculation. Chile high income country would, seen while. haven‚Äôt seen info either. mRNA vaccines worse carbon footprint due dry ice needed transport ;) literally said US could achieve many reasons border crossings wwaayy list reson couldn't. Even things NZ suffered illegal border crossings might still saved hundreds thousands lives. Hundreds thousands. feel you. mom high risk I‚Äôm 60s clue open GA. :( gets stress little less though  parts community/on social media 'Norway 23 patients die getting Pfizer vaccine' story amplified reverse effect. Automod became slightly based. 65 year old may natural lifespan left healthy 30 year old. closer death? Actually option might silly. 360 million adults EU every adult get 2 doses EU needs 720 million. Pfizer deliver 500 million, AZ 300 million, J&amp;J 200 million Curevac 225 million. option 100 million delivered Q3-4 means EU already fully vaccinated doses spare. Cancel culture finest. 

NYT quotes researcher words context make China looks like transparent. 

WHO researcher use twitter debunk news.

Next day breaking news researcher ties China. people saying stuff experts said open everything summer. guess experts right. reality tough, mean reality. governments followed expert advice first place variants would've covid control. 'we can't stay locked forever' ones causing us continue cause us locked longer. Serbia second world, though? Seasonality impact cases rose dramatically December January falling February. 

Yes seasonality (specifically likelihood inside vs outside number large gatherings per season) general impact, temperature weather explain current decline. months ago hemorrhoids surgically removed. Don‚Äôt know effects vax be, can‚Äôt possibly match recovery had. scientific rationale Canadien government would allow vaccinated person US Canada?  perspective, opinion 100% useless. Probably vice versa. let's keep out. proposals violation human rights. SAF variant possibly variant 6 months' time. influenza virus works like that, too, hemisphere going winter gets variant dominant hemisphere. 

I really hope AZ shelved EU, Pfizer Moderna seem future proof. true. mother host different maladies, teaches special education students, person, age 64.5 years. eligible makes sick worry. hope happen, also need take steps minimise chances happening, keeping covid cases low possible, thus giving opportunity evolve.


Dr Fauci ‚ÄòViruses cannot mutate don‚Äôt replicate‚Äô That's simple matter wrong use term ""eradication"". indeed impossible right virus animal reservoirs immunity sterilizing lifelong kind. term correct context (and author means say judging contents article) ""elimination"", community transmission Canadian society authorities try ensure situation maintained strict border closures quarantine measures everyone enters country pandemic calmed enough borders reopened again. According figures suggest EU paying less $2 Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine, U.S. paying around $4. U.S. negotiated $20 price tag Pfizer. EU‚Äôs price less $15.¬† Missing: ""What children?"" 

I guess education became optional US. kind fits, things considered. Problem even year, treat covid problem need confront. become obvious learned ton problems approach covid caused. Like said, mental health, education lapsing, drug abuse increased, delayed treatment serious illness, etc, etc. Yet seem ignore facts determining next steps forward. next steps always based covid. seems like attitude ‚Äú we‚Äôll address things covid over‚Äù. Instead taking every aspect account.

It ‚Äúhow X restriction, X policy covid affect kids mental health education? it‚Äôs going significantly impact it, maybe find alternative x policy won‚Äôt impact kids, Heath, abuse etc. Even new X policy perfect solution covid‚Äù roommate probably sick covid then. say propose them. said opinion aim achieved case agree conditions. think much lighter measures achieve near zero without waiting vaccines, hope right. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

You‚Äôve gone way try deflect points I‚Äôve made call uneducated, seems assertion you‚Äôre Chinese spot on. again, Sweden still terrible compared neighbors. Sweden major advantages. Stockholm worlds highest rate single occupancy living, little multigenerational housing, low population density, land border country severe outbreaks, etc. Education one biggest indicators health making poverty. Remote learning affects disadvantaged society most. one point Baltimore city school enrollment 30%. entire generation may left behind. 

Why ok you? get wrong. listen experts, different fields decision end elected politicians. That's society pays salary. delegate economic decisions academic board economists, healthcare decisions board doctors... then, point democracy elections? heartbreaking. Despite person going about, feel schools open safely, district not. took advice chiropractor veterinarian. even kidding. Well sorry, peer reviewed concerns vaccine whose Phase III trial data bit confusing. think snap UK vs EU worldview try see things objectively. People aren‚Äôt trying tell forever. fact is, haven‚Äôt even vaccinated 65+ year olds yet. Teachers starting get vaccinated states. Retail workers aren‚Äôt even yet. sorry means hold licking doorknobs another several months. Thank you, mine. developed severe health anxiety throughout this. already knew tendency panic, amplified quarantine got on. started overanalyse every single little place ache pain. Convinced going die several times. 22nd count micronations. Andorra San Marino really aren‚Äôt good comparisons global scale. sound like developed country. wrong original comment got removed. 

Btw, absolutely feel schools open safely, *some way*. district not. also union worker teacher, assumptions wrong. It‚Äôs 21st century jobs work. Even pandemic, valuable jobs growth areas rewarded creative thinking adaptability, it‚Äôs coincidence jobs already experimenting remote work flexible hours beforehand. stagnant parts economy involve jobs people perform rote menial tasks again.

In economy driven union manufacturing labor, needed workforce could show time, think much, follow orders, clock out. economy hasn‚Äôt worked way long time.

It doesn‚Äôt make sense schools still training students think behave way service-oriented economy. Hi everyone,

I curious... past months general consensus reinfections ‚Äúrare‚Äù.

Now, 13,000 reinfections reported (staff + residents) new 10 week CDC see data service call network tab cms.gov (government data source). It‚Äôs legit.

Why y‚Äôall wrong? church repeatedly evaded COVID-19 health ordinances pandemic, warranting cease-and-desist City Attorney Dennis Herrera Archdiocese San Francisco. I'm Russian vaccine long goes proper approval process. Contrary Russian claims, EMA still get request approval. think never intended to. political game get recognition. Anyways, doubt capacities supply substantial amounts abroad addition vaccinating Russian population. start signing licensing agreements produce Sputnik V now, going take end year produce substantial quantities. time, enough Western vaccines distributed free charge reduced price 3rd world.

Vaccine geopolitics beginning, vaccines best new variants win game. It‚Äôs easy google search. took time searching information typing comment variants 1 minute searching would give many articles talking they‚Äôre protective severe illness variants concern. Astonishingly enough, teacher still giving kids props every day even though someone literally Covid. really unreasonable stay home severely sick, yet schools pretend like is... wife teacher many friends family teachers understand somewhat.

I saying teacher fix things. county, school board, union. think unreasonable send teachers situations safe. also think unreasonable close schools teachers refuse teach. Keeping kids home year major, major problem every one kids families. think people charge working hard enough find solution instead putting burden teachers families.

And said it, choices put it, complain supervisor union, quit. quit might forever always jobs there. blame state bullshit. job. case referring to? evidence specifically? Scratch that, I'm looking paper see nothing 4991, RaTG13, RaBtCoV. Maybe I'm missing hurt another set eyes, report referring really lost 12 months. Losing 4 isn‚Äôt going kill alternative kill others  time. Seriously. Teachers really burning public's good right now. punishing poor attendance actually anything improve though? It‚Äôs one child that‚Äôs REPORTED. clue many there. Don‚Äôt naive, everything reported media. No. agree views vaccines, still oppose making compulsory. Good thing particular example live military bases, mostly risking colleagues also preferred take vaccine. maybe better someone else, someone vulnerable get vaccine refused get, since shortage now, decision reduce number vaccinated people, changes getting it. actually tidy system all, somehow people think is, afraid. quality life Europe enormously better everyone, fabulous extremely wealthy, need live fear wherever go. squalor poverty Europe less squalid less poor less desperate. great mass working people produce things provide services decent lives, produce nicer things provide better services, happier. forth.

It's even taxes, rich Europe remain fabulously wealthy. Puritanism twisted fusion capitalism mutated ""work ethic,"" makes work end itself, rather means end.

I mean, labor rules social benefits Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, on, *all* introduced *obviously make society better place everyone.* Obviously, objectively, undeniably. reason introduce cannot greed, benefits working people demonstrably *don't stop fabulously rich people fabulously rich.* joy rich much richer: sadistic domineering desire win cost. Now, seen go badly wrong, lately? day risk needing put ventilator dying. worse virus.  haha, calling Chile ""third world""

why ""third world"" country like Chile higher life expectancy glorious US Hell yeah. won‚Äôt remember couple boring drives even don‚Äôt end getting vaccinated, you‚Äôll always remember gotten early shot. Wow, applause. ""Whatabout FREEDOM"" huge reason many people died. say that, lol. 

When pull whole ‚Äúlol conservative bootstraps‚Äù schtick, serve piss people off. start another tired circlejerk. 

For it‚Äôs worth, totally agree it‚Äôs BS Aussie/ NZ get gimped. distribution literal matter life death. vaccine distribution really used reward/punishment? philosophical end argument death sentence people live countries didn‚Äôt lock properly. individuals probably didn‚Äôt say selfish government did. 

Not really looking argue, I‚Äôm saying really difficult question warrants respect someone disagree with. 22nd according John Hopkins. Probably lower would look excess deaths instead. Kind middle pack countries trustworthy Politicians like dates. really unpopular opinion variants prevent/delay normalcy even further? exactly think happen. imagine done third world country. purely scientifically, keeping people lockdown eternity always answer viruses

Economy virus go hand-in-hand. No, apply nurses require high amount training enter field, relatively high paying profession (in comparison income population exploitation high concern). lot nations rely advice potential outbreaks, say ""close borders"" ""stop incoming flights"" many countries happily carry letting people without thinking potential consequences so. Seeing large viral load induce infection important. highly doubt people sign willing say statement. valid comparison pediatrician educated experienced infectious diseases whereas podiatrist headaches/neurology diseases.

In scope pediatricians know, ID part large one.

This say they're epidemiologist, epidemiologists treat patients either. science following?  Ah yes brexit. That‚Äôs SOUTH AFRICA also using AZ anymore. even giving away. brexit. Lol. Whoosh ""...no clear evidence human-to-human transmission novel evidence wearing masks healthy people protect evidence evidence absence. get tattoo! even touch long-term psychological effects school aged children. looking High School Class 2021 first one prom. microcosm social development missing on.

For one year now, 11 year old son primary interaction two 40 somethings. already behind socio-emotional development, imagine impact years come. lucky enough go in-person 4 days week. know similarly situated children much worse. Heck, school choiced top district, would spent day in-person town school. concern reaching herd immunity seems myopic me. even know exactly threshold is, nevermind extremely difficult measure societal immunity.

We need focus hospitalizations deaths comes public policy. Even cases reliable tabulation relies many factors. 

[His history surely trying push agenda. example  agree fuck triage policy can‚Äôt applied international scale...in general, medical policy gives zero fucks whether ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù something. dude beating shit wife stabs dick, stub toe saving orphan train, 100% seen ER you.

Of course, apply world whole, global economy would collapse would covid hell another 2+ years, people would probably overthrow leaders putting citizens first, etc etc. there‚Äôs million reasons won‚Äôt work.

But medicine itself? Yeah doctors honey badgers comes patients morals. least be.  Control IL-6 use anti coagulant use anti inflammatory medicines help lungs. False. Four teachers/staff school district died catching virus school. Another ventilator return classroom 2022 rehab goes well. plenty virus many ongoing issues. 

Also false people sending kids school sick. time. dose kid meds around lunch, meds wear kid shows symptoms. 

You pretty much incorrect statements, that‚Äôs energy right now. Still surprised little news hear California variant 30% (50% LA) cases. Every time get downvoted correcting statements like ""COVID death rate 3-10%"" ""Case numbers rising country"" ""40% even mild COVID cases end causing permanent organ damage"", wonder even bother. guess way attempting fight back misinformation that's partially caused much life stripped away me, leaves even depressed misinformation gets upvoted sources whatsoever. reason sometimes feels like never going end anti-maskers Super Bowl crowds, people legitimately believe get good news I‚Äôm young healthy. Honestly thing that‚Äôs keeping locked local restrictions. lived Florida, I‚Äôd partying summer. besties probably gonna take trip Miami June üéâ üíÉ still done kids‚Äô school last year, fact week (virtual) party kids perfect attendance last 9 weeks virtual school. wonder we‚Äôre back classrooms. Emily Oster preaching re-opening schools since July, back data all. argument ‚Äúdata‚Äù ignore cases across country opened schools outbreaks schools close again. Yet somehow held time time media kind expert re-opening subject matter really clearly biased beginning. least dozen articles last year citing alone ‚Äúscience‚Äù supports reopening schools. huge red flag really can‚Äôt believe one caught yet.

I'm SC everything wide open times. Oh wait, bars must close 11. Don‚Äôt PPE it‚Äôs easier get? Wait 15/hour vaccine prioritization? Wait joke haha

Israel 45% (1st dose) demand already slowing down. get point demand slowing supply higher demand. fully expect 1st dose summer healthy 34-year old living NL fat people eat restaurants? I'm good shape eat clean cheat meal restaurant every week  It‚Äôs news right isn‚Äôt great news agencies. variant stands become dominant, B117 contain E484K point dominant one country. Despite talk variants aren‚Äôt credible projections variants SA Brazil dominant soon, B117 become dominant two variants make extremely small fraction cases outside native countries. 

Even B117 becoming prevalent transmissible, seeing massive drop cases worldwide, it‚Äôs racing vaccines warmer weather vaccines highly effective it

For Bristol variant concern, take consideration it‚Äôs taken nearly 12 months one variant even START becoming problem worldwide. Bristol variant become issue expect somehow overnight B117 pick E484K, might happen long run, we‚Äôll myriad boosters vaccines 

Point being, it‚Äôs easier news media report ‚Äúscary new variant‚Äù instead everything wrote It‚Äôs 18 30 year olds children don‚Äôt need parental consent. nature exponential growth. one variant's r factor tiny bit larger, difference long run enormous.

Just give intuition. Lets consider virus r0 1.5 virus r0 2.0 lets consider 10 generations. 1.5^10 =~ 58 2.0^10 = 1024. hypothetical viruses start 1 case (so 50/50) 10 generations 94% infections contagious variant.  teaching environment unsafe proper PPE screening.

WHO THIS? go multiple schools multiple districts weekly job. Teachers real PPE. Cloth masks, sure. Maybe bleach water spray bottle half pack paper towels.

I school Monday. hour, saw multiple kids lean around plexiglas partitions talk other, pull masks repeatedly, touch face/mask touch various things room, pull masks sneeze, pull mask chew pencil (that teacher gave them), go sit another students desk bare face desk...and new kid showed middle class mask adult walked told teacher ""I would given mask office.""

That one hour one class one school. Interesting, yeah, sister thinks sucks educational stand point, way way less work her. Maybe district top things. gas, cleaning agents liquids off-gas, I'm really sure there's direct comparison made.  

With liquid cleaner wear gloves, ventilate, *normally* going fine. Ozone cause damage either due high-level short exposure, low-level long exposure. fact gas, need safe work effectively cleaner, means harder handle general. 

Plus under-regulated US, still buy powerful Ozone generators right Amazon(!). Industrial restrictions also fairly lax. like selling X-Ray machines public ""toys"" 1950s, Ozone generators usage even medical setting, used professionals considered Ozone remediation going work. Doctors percent population lower developing nations, loss one greater effect patient outcomes. So, producers either make patents available everyone else also producing cannot handle demand both. 

Prioritizing citizens extends pandemic longer gives chances mutations might require rounds vaccination, lockdowns, masks, etc.

How long want last? 

Long time = Prioritize yourself. 

Shorter time = Try get everyone worldwide vaccinated apologies. remove now. mean, Biden made shit load campaign promises, sure smoking. Based do√¥mer kid. 

**YOU GOT CHICKENPOX**

that it. fact life.

prepare every single kid 3-5th grade disappear 2 weeks come back pox scars.

99.99% kids got itchy that's it.

when grandparent kids pre 1955

**YOU GOT POLIO**

that it. fact life.

prepare *some* kids end paralyzed.

and end dead.

everyone knew someone had/has polio.

&amp;#x200B;

we even FUCKED VACCINE killed kids.

&amp;#x200B;

but close April 1955 200 000 children five Western mid-Western USA states received polio vaccine process inactivating live virus proved defective. Within days reports paralysis within month first mass vaccination programme polio abandoned. Subsequent investigations revealed vaccine, manufactured California-based family firm Cutter Laboratories, caused 40 000 cases polio, ***leaving 200 children varying degrees paralysis killing pandemic made clear dangerous is.**

we've sent kids school way dangerous shit air.

the ""overemphasis"" recent phenomenon

been since schools invented.  India it‚Äôs offer world alternative east China Russia, honestly better human rights individualistic, capitalist society offers little communal infrastructure support families way could. That's newsworthy  Public sector unions need die.  Pretty sure kids Aberdeen get vacation days December hunt pheasants LOL. opener October, none locals hunt December.

The kids stuff town. Thanks correction, type-y-types. Words matter people getting covid get around $4,000 year long commitment experimented on. risking possible death definitely long term health issues think would paid bit havent called anything before, call fucking idiot now, hows that? trying use ""but theres enough data"" line claim vaccine ineffective results 40 people. Vaccine approval boards around world approved vaccine somehow know better. Maybe give call set right eh?


You came thread clear agenda, trying sow disinformation bizarre reason. Ive provided information chose ignore, shove ideology antivax asshole. UK fifth-highest vaccination rate world. European country way ahead US. Oh, flat wrong. 2 better, say 1 nothing ignorant universe live kids don‚Äôt need provided for?

Kids indeed need provided for, that's everyone right living wage. say right living wage, say right reproduce. kind argument usually results genocide years later. US used similar logic mass sterilize ""undesirables"" one point history. Turns everyone stopped dicks folks could get job provide themselves....until min wage kept dropping relative inflation national wealth.

I would turn around you: company can't pay living wage, fit remain capitalism-based ecosystem go business. Absolutely does, understand feel way. think fair make sweeping generalizations though. ""Vice President Harris"" thanks. LUCKY! I‚Äôm stuck Minnesota too! Hoping either go Florida something like 2022 spring break, unfortunately staying home year though. Cheers April thaw! üòÇ pun buddy.... donates political campaigns? Published December 8, updated two weeks ago.


Posted country vaccinating 30 years olds? I‚Äôm done shit. Fuck everyone. Fuck Bill Gates. Fuck corporations. Fuck pharmaceutical industry. Fuck CDC. phrase ""vaccine passports"" fearmongery. Requiring vaccination records international travel existed since 1940s. asked BELIEVED should. Obviously say yes. ohhhh purposelly fuding deaths counted nursing homes. thanks I'm everyone getting vaccinated possible. People really stretching means ""teacher"". Young people, message therapists, people random fields study Involve classroom settings getting vaccine. Even teachers want it.

They prioritize old people first  doctors experts infectious disease deal daily basis. Would ask podiatrist advice headaches? That‚Äôs saying. That's funny... sister friends teachers complain nonstop much sucks, kids engaged, much extra work requires them, can't wait get back classroom soon they're vaccinated (but state prioritizing teacher vaccinations) closing bars person dining, question? i'm opinion things much lower priority list getting schools reopened. i'm understanding question correctly. they're much less essential schools. though i'm also opinion schools reopen fully, hybrid style that's likely worst possible combination terms spreading virus. I've said thing √Æn another post down-voted oblivion. Maybe worded poorly smth, also think limited supply vaccines bad idea vaccinate teachers returning classes instead vulnerable People. Maybe sign it? mean pull 60,000,000 adults math J&amp;J vaccine never factor back calculate long it'll take.

You need add 60,000,000 back 233,383,265 end. Agreed. believe we‚Äôre vaccinating teachers vaccinate current childcare workers, formal informal, caring kids due school closures? 4 neighbor kids house right now, they‚Äôve 11 months parents go work. neighbor kids full time daycare. yet workers, family, currently ones exposed whatever risk comes associating kids (which isn‚Äôt much, I‚Äôm actually worried it, teachers) passed favor teachers won‚Äôt even agree return work. will, terrible ‚Äòhybrid‚Äô system forces childcare arrangement continue bc hybrid school short, raises childcare worker‚Äôs risk kids multiple cohorts. Yet can‚Äôt vaccinated work home teachers can. Absolutely vile stuff. ""moving towards less"" cut it. End all. bring others. one wishes get infected, infect accord. kids teacher got others working interacting public every day baffles me. mean oregon even vaccinated many senior population yet young healthy teachers get others cannot work ""remotely "" fucking joke....... Yawn I'm spending unmasked time family regardless vaccination... People wait another year. Yup. too. 24 hours shit. sleep last night. Hey ur doorknob sure people downvoting this... projections showed anticipated drop winter holidays. Projections incorporated vaccinations scenario, exclude them, show similar drop. impact vaccinations hopefully keep us another larger wave summer fall, hopefully transmission die -- getting us wave. impression names Fairfax County registration system rolled onto statewide system launched week? Good them. you‚Äôre answering question. district policy eat classrooms, would feel comfortable working without vaccine? Hey get level-headed response things. /s

A lot people angry polarized start. looking react something emotions instead thinking. even talking about? 

It‚Äôs fault you‚Äôre upset support capitalist system. 

Like, what? Cool story, at? poorly defend them. Ultimately lot decisions judgemental dont scientific answer, happens criticized previous administration making decisions way they're forced now. Seriously. /u/mrmrsmonk you‚Äôre regular recent posts comment basically ranting you‚Äôre ‚Äúdevout‚Äù follower left. start argument anyone else even posts. arguing with?

I get it, we‚Äôve year adopt new scary hellscape, know there‚Äôs going perfect switch one day we‚Äôre full pandemic mode next day everything 100% safe. It‚Äôs going lot adjusting risk assessment little steps that‚Äôs really hard handle us since we‚Äôve basically ‚Äúthe world trying kill us‚Äù mode last year.

But take deep breath. We‚Äôll figure out. happened overnight two weeks January 12 numbers changed steady growth steady decline? change numbers explained almost everyone catching (false), significant change behavior.

""Enough population immunity cause virus slow down"" herd immunity. That's meaning term. seems like something would best done year ago understand much impact young adults coronavirus spread death tolls. Lol pointing reality fear mongering. people vaccinated summer sub keep pretending case matter many times people say pandemic April. Pandemic largely year it‚Äôs gonna April. can‚Äôt use current productions extrapolate out. Every time see trend doesn‚Äôt hold virus behaves ways hard predict. Right, we‚Äôre getting philosophical place. government enforce adults wear seatbelt? seems reasonable law many, idea could construed ‚Äúnanny state‚Äù. feels like you‚Äôre overlooking nuance this. said, want schools reopen well. let‚Äôs also recognize challenge people conversations adequate level risk objective thing. It‚Äôs subjective, underlying question fall responsibility government protect citizens. happen fall place responsibility, thousands laws currently exist widely accepted reasonable government creating laws protect individuals themselves. get symptoms fat? Also long term effects rare... Haha done so, please tell data basing comments Az effectiveness SA variant..... never really started wiping groceries down. seem necessary. I'll wash hands get home putting groceries away. also always wash produce, pandemic. packaged items, see need wipe down.

Haven't caught COVID personally data says really transmissible surfaces want ease up, fine. liked it! Maybe ignorant question, mail carriers work close proximity general public? area, deliver mail packages (obviously) minimal, any, direct interaction mail recipients. city shutting mean?

People going places. school, restaurants, small gatherings, you. one drove street entire day. Went Wal-mart get something every parking lot way basically empty.

COVID spreads small gatherings alongside everything else slowed crawl. specialist post viral fatigue syndrome chronic fatigue syndrome that's symptoms had. lung heart symptoms.

He basically said post viral fatigue, experience people get around 80/90% health back eventually, rare get back 100%.

Basically immune system gone nuts, thinks there's still active infection one. Extreme fatigue/exhaustion brain fog main symptoms.

I bed bound 2-3 months. husband cook bring food bed even walking downstairs would wipe weeks.

My energy much better now, I'm able things individually, rest between. can't get go things like used do, pace myself.

So example, today mopped floor. sit rest hour. could vacuum bit, rest etc. 

My brain fog improved, I'm still getting confused sometimes, work much harder used be. brain seems work slower. cannot compared ebola, 2 reasons:

1) transmission ebola nothing like COVID; nearly contagious making containment way easier without much effort, banning flights. 

2) Ebola never responsible pandemic, like mentioned above, transmission much different COVID therefore would unfair compare endemic disease disease ripped entire global population matter months. think cases increasing, pessimistic users swarm sub. typically optimistic ones stay away. cases going down, optimists return post more, pessimists stay away. Wayne County population 1.75 million, administered 21,564 (1.2%): County population 1.26 million, administered 41,223 vaccines (3.3%): County population 0.9 million, administered 64,953 (7.5%): three counties account 40% state's population (all Detroit area). Far cry 11.3%. That‚Äôs fantastic point. I‚Äôll definitely using that, thanks. Dude comment history wall shitting AZ vaccine. talk lack data proclaim ineffective AZ vaccine SA variant based tiny study. least consistent. Pfizer division involved headquartered US. 

We also three vaccines developed American companies. 

Oh BioNTech using advancement pioneered discovered Philadelphia. clue - family friends teachers could get pass teachers even vac could give kids others around them. started top worked age groups beginning job. admitted was, basically, making numbers herd immunity threshold order influence public opinion. thought low (70% recall) threshold would encourage vaccination, went number, even though knew truthful.

I respect him, work ethic, credentials deep level, whole situation made question says lot often. results they're looking seem remotely worth it.

Back discussing human trials get vaccines approved seemed least little reasonable take risk. Exactly. always place skeptics someone providing book end argument.

But extreme pessimism communication strategy especially lockdowns wide deep repercussions across country. balance. Yesterday told young people üòê math this, law averages, person would need personally know 12,540 people order 19 died Covid-19 system. 

I'm pretty friendly guy, personally know 500 people first name would go way say hello street. possible person stretching admittedly vague definition personally knowing someone. Heck, even knowing 12,540 people's first names stretch. kiwis know lawmakers would everything possible prevent ""really bad"" thing happening first place.

That's 5 deaths per million population instead thousands US has... talk skeptical people, ask them: ""If doubt vaccines safe, think would've given Joe Biden?"" Republicans wanted nothing return? asking parties tend play games. Criticism NY Cuomo inherently attacking Florida.

You both. welcome go comment history. made remarks study protection severe disease Pfizer reported. interesting news something aware prepare for. see putting masks years...more social distancing needed. miss concerts safety first. Also really surprised posting removed yet. Right that‚Äôs point. Even loss smell still risk, preventative measures come we've tracking mutations since beginning pandemic, everyone's paying lot attention turned change effect. mean every single mutation discover does.

But also, we're coming ginormous global wave, much larger couple that, there's lot opportunities mutations appear. getting 20% figure? Bloomberg's vaccination tracker shows today ~12.2% received 1+ dose ~4.7% received 2 doses today (the 4.7% part 12.2%). looking projection: places restrictions already stated targets, we'll reach those. started reaching last summer/fall certain areas restrictions gradually lifted, put place things got worse winter again. amazing honestly. perfect, pretty good overall. know people complained people posting getting vaccine love see makes feel hopeful. immunocompromised friends able get appointments next month thrilled them. Sweden Mexico.

Same drop. 

Israel vaccinated people earliest, actually drop. doesn‚Äôt mean body microchip We're taking measures *for* people 65+. death rates ages similar flu, ever instituted lockdowns, contact tracing, etc. Literally reason death rate 65+ high.

So, no, fuck no. ""old people"" get priority young ass *need* vaccine. Go hang state bottom half covid cases per capita? literally teaching students school high-risk educator paying PPE submit medical requests accommodations negotiating *alone* three different schools. even get first vaccine shot week come back maternity leave. one situation, long shot. either work person pay PPE, get fired... district can't even find substitute leave, fired they'd ANOTHER teacher down.

The teachers strong unions refusing go back without getting vaccines minority expect aiming middle ground kind. us own. 


Please keep mind even schools 100% safe in-person, kids would still learning crap year compared normal year. parents still works, grandparents dying. know what's going goddamn stressful depressing. even care kids learning days long get communicate, respond, share empathy other. myth ""lost year"" can't made adding stress panic. grandmother died someone nursing home exposed virus. person's responsibility facility's responsibility protect residents. Kevin Bacon chain 100 people caused death responsibility 330 million people throughout country lock houses protect her.

My in-laws 80's careful interacting public. get groceries delivered, eat home, talk friends phone zoom, visit kids grandkids, etc. really rocket science. They're statically 10,000 times much risk lot careful. getting vaccinated, are, they'll get back lives. every person risk done this?

Instead people go public rely thousands people know protect them? make sense?  already covid first dose likely worse.. me. Second shitty bad sound like one people thinks anything left shooting homeless people sport Socialism. said doubt know difference Socialism, Social Democracy Neolibralism one actually applies New Zealand. way states require certain vaccines public school students. indeed make law vaccines. doesn‚Äôt mean right, ethical, can/will enforced. 

Government loves make laws rather fixing broken policies. imagine annoyed you‚Äôd daycare worker informal childcare provider kids everyday 11 months (because kids don‚Äôt vanish aren‚Äôt school) teachers jump front keep teaching remote lessons childcare worker sits kids person vaccine priority. kid‚Äôs teacher literally taught lessons tropical vacation palm trees waving background months ago, jumps front line, still doesn‚Äôt agree go back work. make lie? comment linking mprnews.org automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

At point I'm like ""you know mask wearing protect YOU, DEMOGRAPHIC, right? what's that, zero fucks given protect others? I'm absolutely fine getting sick then."" media wants divert attention 

Source/Proof it‚Äôs grand conspiracy perpetuated thousands journalists across globe?

e: mission public education offer equal education children. Letting good teachers flee bad schools going reinforce existing inequality. 

I get neglect infrastructure kinds vogue adult life, that‚Äôs problem needs fixed, free market can‚Äôt that. 

Arguably, shouldn‚Äôt asked that. 

I suspect actually agree quite lot things we‚Äôre going back forth slightly different axes approach. way I‚Äôve able look entire situation positively goal lose weight summer 2020 wasn‚Äôt reached able extra year get body wanted lol I've searched scientific proof can't find it. hoping maybe new data something showing things like confidence intervals statistical analysis regards efficacy severe cases. still seem exist. Agreed completely mate. volunteers study forcefully made so, I'm sure called unethical.  new trend ‚Äúexclaiming‚Äù pandemic expiration date bizarre. teacher, absolutely applaud this. teach NY thankful receive first dose vaccine last Saturday. teacher friends idea state even open vaccines educators. teaching person since September 24 first graders class. It‚Äôs insane. think Cuomo done lot things harm teachers since he‚Äôs office, I‚Äôm quite happy prioritized us. Dude, freaking study see Covid people! Why, fuck, would one vaccinate them?! trial supposed do! illiterate what's problem here?

They want study people **sick** Covid! That's infecting people **with covid**. mean anyways? huge says lot currently throwing people may may work strains. important news note since means remain social distancing mask wearing years least. I'm fine waiting concert habit safe. exactly I‚Äôm at. child? ‚ÄúNo one make me‚Äù reaction toddler. come Redditors wishing death upon them. mean shit pretty awful way live. point definitely would not. seems like kids young adults ones getting hit hardest this, usual. I‚Äôd pissed them. I'm willing say much- obviously infections result immunity, there's way effect certain strata. people Cali staying home distancing- people still make effort distance street. Oh fuck vaccine sceptic arse, tired trope again. guarantee exact thing reported mRNA vaccine would doubt questions all. comes territory, positivityrate. think critically analyze information, sharing thoughts catch flak multiple groups, even ones typically aligned overall. significantly restrictions area US. Denmark Germany lockdown. 

I also think vaccines only, definitely help add large portion population immune past infection. still 2/3 population vulnerable illness plenty spread virus albeit reduced rate. workers option vaccinated yet opening larger gatherings/ending mask mandates two months earlier worth exposing millions people haven‚Äôt chance vaccinated yet. Israel metrics mention already they‚Äôre still seeing lot deaths/hospitalizations/cases. need significant portion population vaccinated end masks open large gatherings like conferences, big weddings, concerts, etc. Depending strictly grocery store enforcing mask mandates (assuming one even exists location) may coming frequent contact people wearing masks all. also likely coming fairly close contact several hundred *different* people shift (albeit shorter duration) compared elementary school teachers generally kids every day. 

I'm teachers getting vaccinated, people start talking prioritizing ahead frontline workers put risk last 12 months get paid significantly less average things start looking bit problematic. even begin touch racial disparities economic power dynamics play. Germany. drop.

Denmark. drop.

Ireland. Mexico. Italy.

All pretty similar drop. mean...the end result same. 

I know people like timelines dates, continue speed much possible, result same. care seeing effort. date be. Yet we're told one guarantee protection infectivity, major symptoms.

We weren't. stupid journalist asked scientist stupid question ""Will prevent us infectious"" scientist answered truthfully ""We positive evidence that"", nobody bothered check question sure trying accomplish arguing questions stupid aside cultivating ego. Certainly educate.

I educate him, though. Question still stupid. don‚Äôt big powerful unions side I'm honestly super jealous progress NY seemed make vaccinations. cite causal link long covid age. impression children almost never get serious symptoms. 

Hope get better soon though mate. ways educate children. requires money political parental support. 

I know family whose 11 year old school year. whole school gets tested every week. sign contract wouldn‚Äôt contact outside families travel quarantine. classroom limited 20 kids don‚Äôt interact classrooms. Everybody masked time. Wednesdays Zoom day home language music home PE classes. families given clear choice: follow rules stay home. it‚Äôs working great ‚Äî it‚Äôs priority families school make person learning safe possible. 

The kids know thrilled school parents. infections. said, takes lot money, educated committed parent group, political power. None things happening public schools. think sports personalities getting millions 1 minute commercial? That's way system works. you‚Äôre looking serious, literal answer: Democratic politicians don‚Äôt want lose teacher union cash cow. don‚Äôt ask scientists done every vaccine then, accusing fake science? That's true grit right Freedom outbid others vaccines export created. ;p

Though understandable given issues shutdowns, glad we're well part this. Ok lets say US goes ""zero COVID"" tomorrow. would handle Mexican border, wide open illegal crossing right now? build wall arm border patrol teeth make sure catch 100% illegal crossings. Canada unless agree go Zero COVID well. wanna round ?5 hard restrictions.... /s mask recommendation point something depends percentage population vaccinated. high percentage vaccinated hospitalization/infections continue decrease, mask recommendations become lenient. Short that, changing mask recommendations point asking round ?5 beast. Woo!!!! trying tell don‚Äôt know anything this, I‚Äôve got way experience do. 

So response believe unfair assessment knowledge ""I know stranger internet"". said uneducated trying sound educated on. Lol. idea planet you‚Äôre you‚Äôre trying say cutting sodas, fast food doesnt help someone lose weight.

I literally said opposite? said end solution like making be. trying tell teaching nutrition, health classes depth bad thing?

Said nothing sort. cannot boil teach good bad foods solves problem. not. 

Perfect example: mother eats pretty sold diet diet (haven't seen eat fast food cheeseburger decades drink soda Starbucks) weight meds stroke 20+ years ago insanely sedentary disabled barely walk. can't give someone like nutrition class call good. scientific term ""DNA Digivolve."" vaccines 75+ yet. I'm doubtful anything close normal point summer. Yes, North SB county hit hard plans yet. Fair point per capita. counter wealthier point, you‚Äôre basically saying nation whole pay average dose vaccine. also means low income folks Europe able get vaccinated; take bit longer. Hate go way see glass half empty, we‚Äôre assume financial benefit favors US, reasonable deduction benefit poor citizens US. least Europe constituents‚Äô backs comes pandemic. think agriculture workers prioritized, least heard Fresno County called ""homogeneity susceptibility"" last summer lot good scientists tried publish papers it. papers largely ignored worried might give much ammunition people arguing letting virus run wild. way, sick Feb 2020

Bad heart palpitations, bad fever, went hospital 

I wonder wonder... Same. I've watching rate change cases hospitalizations weeks, like hawk, waiting sign slowdown drop. shown yet, running time show up. Why? US banned export Batman v Superman line??? 

Why??? Immediately sequences released, BLAST analysis showed segments unusual commonality different family viruses. great-granfathers house built street. center road eventually torn down. It‚Äôs normal infection-control measures. Mask up, social distancing, avoid crowded indoor areas, etc. It‚Äôs apparent NZ Australia last countries receive vaccines, since obviously don‚Äôt need them. keep borders closed 2023, long takes. submission linking blogspot.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

The issue Trump politicizes schools reopening left stuck early 2020 spreading fear anxiety in-person schools parents pissed done letting children carry failures leadership anxieties others. grains vegetarianism.

Nothing inherently wrong either categories evidenced culture's obesity statistics. Whole, minimally processed grains vegetarianism associated better health outcomes many cultures/diets.

The primary problem US eating habits portion size followed culture hyper-palatable, calorie-dense processed food. US culture trains people overeat choose foods less filling calorically dense. Reminder part doses manufactured Europe fir European people sent USA fill finish. Let's see pans out. can't rate stay same? 


Not sure rate referring to. can't nurses get sick shit quit render hospitalization stat less meaningful?

Is indication that's going last couple days death count gone down, early pop open beer, valentine's day, president's day, climate collapse going (and weekend), reporting could lagging behind.

People choose understand death reporting lagging indicator. Deaths go today's numbers deaths happened yesterday. takes weeks get full accounting given day, sometimes months. We're still posting deaths November today's People generally predicted winter would bad. bad. suppose almost time lift restrictions westerners get plane third world countries infect without access medical care.

I imagine would pandemic weeks. 


Cool prediction. Show work? Jeez, man. That‚Äôs definition triggered. You‚Äôre seeing want that. You‚Äôre trying tell don‚Äôt know anything this, I‚Äôve got way experience do. 

I never said ‚Äúobese people dont care.‚Äù Wtf? You‚Äôre getting emotional, trying frame hostile obese people. I‚Äôm saying oppostite, aren‚Äôt listening. context, mentioning cigarettes, people weren‚Äôt told dangers. Education paramount. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm talking about. 

I idea planet you‚Äôre you‚Äôre trying say cutting sodas, fast food *doesnt* help someone lose weight. much empty calories. It‚Äôs designed make crave more. Function caloric deficient, you‚Äôll lose weight. never said easy, lol. people couldn‚Äôt give sugar week. Even aware calories food important. soda refills add up. Frappuccino‚Äôs, smoothies. People pitched many foods, aren‚Äôt given knowledge know make best choices. You‚Äôre trying tell teaching nutrition, health classes depth bad thing? Helping people make better choices healthier, avoid adverse risk factors? Obesity problem. epidemic. lot mitigate it. That‚Äôs bad thing, homie. metric. Ironically that's dangerous coronavirus . could've waited another week like Flu? warrant lockdown, even pandemic.    I'm legally required wear mask inside every indoor space nah ""moved life"" promise, deliver.

I'm adding list phrases never want hear this. point massive shift subreddit‚Äôs tone overwhelmingly (and correctly, IMO) blaming anti-lockdown people last April saying personally can‚Äôt expected follow scientific recommendations ten months later it‚Äôs taking long (like protracted global campaigns common enemies threaten everyone sort known do). Yes what‚Äôs worse, work fields. Agriculture. worth time, believe anything fits narrative. Grow up, wanna Saint, Frankie. Biden seems less confident/optimistic *Fauci.* get under-promise, deliver, **absurd.**

*Christmas* normal? 1.5 years shit? Nope. happening. I'm giving weeks shot arm, I'm done. mean **done.** I'm fit 30 year old, I'm almost last line. group vaccinated enough, nothing is. Period. Life needs go point sake life one worth living. talking California?  i'll support vaccine needs something pessimistic about. states last month started opening eligibility specific groups, healthcare workers people nursing homes (sometimes) old people chronic illnesses. good intentions, unfortunately, meant vaccination workers waiting around time people make appointments. One friends, nurse got vaccinated limited-eligibility period, said lots doses free appointments hospital waiting qualified people sign up.

Fortunately, government finally opened eligibility wide enough doses getting arms. fact still debated we're months actively giving vaccines nothing short colossal failure. knew vaccine coming eventually. almost entire year figure shit out. effort figure actually got vaccines? pathetic. still understand rapid review last 2. less effective overall, fact takes far less time difficulty 1 shot could ultimately make impactful 2. Get lower risk people tier. That's entirely decision I'll support right even personal choice I'll make cry more? would still try get can!! might make drive fast lol it‚Äôll race symptoms Saaaame Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted, it‚Äôs true. don't, probably slapshot.

Cheers. Damn. Well i‚Äôll reconsider getting lol globally respected authority pathogens, think would foresight take random Chinese scientist's word announce world platform?

**THAT** argument here. tweet never posted. directly caused spread deadly virus (false) reassurance safety.

That literally worse Trump downplaying COVID-19, which, get wrong, also absolutely horrible. leave right get shot takes exactly 12 hours you‚Äôll getting destination right starts kick in... people know exactly 12 hours shot, worst part symptoms lasts 12-24 hours. cannot car symptoms come definitely safe... shot 3 pm 3 hundred degree fever, shaking, vomiting curled ball bathroom floor... Maybe he's company *gives* u covid then, u survive, bills u ur acquiered immunity? even close ok. take 5-10 months vaccinate vulnerable parts population. We've told past year reason we've much lives taken away us prevent hospitals overwhelmed. Vaccinate elderly immunocompromised, immediately let rest us actually live lives again. I'm obligation keep wearing mask rest life numbers safe I'm vaccinated personal comfort 

If afraid catching cold nothing stopping responsible wearing one ""making bed""

It's common saying real world one‚Äôs obligation observing science leads minimal transmission one-year expiry date, it. one‚Äôs mental health endangered one‚Äôs body CoVID opinion professional, get that. first many struggles engage coming years (consider much automation going happen retail service next five years). We‚Äôre stat check progress heartbeat global economy failing miserably wherever possible US. Africa doesn‚Äôt consist black people.

You must 12 uneducated. experience? side effects? understand ""no evidence"" means? mean absolute unchangeable truth experience second dose? I‚Äôll likely 12 car hour ride back getting second dose. ""trigged"" (fuk can't wait people stop using response comment disagreeing them, thing that's triggering using word triggered) I'm sorry find someone challenging statement insulting real world everyone going agree you. say please get triggered? 

Your entire comment boiled fast food soda bad. ones saying bad excess, literally one. people focus blame food blame person ""not caring"" ... helping literally one actually care anyone's health. 

Most obese adults morons. know good bad foods know healthy unhealthy amount food know exercise important. People shouting ""get rid fast food soda"" solve someone's relationship food mental physical obstacles weight loss. Telling obese people care definitely solve problems. bed perfectly fine, cheers. 

I wish well too. bad. read bad coverage it. Edited post reflect. Oh yeah? aggressive variant already exists:

[NewScientist: Two variants merged heavily mutated There‚Äôs lot wrong it, dude. Especially, people weren‚Äôt taught negative effects. 

We‚Äôre discussing risk factor, get killed. 

I‚Äôm shaming people model thin. That‚Äôs unrealistic. I‚Äôm taking better educated, across board make better decisions. And, maybe government mandates regarding sizes soft drinks, availablity children, schools good thing. Healthier meals, education students good thing. make adulthood, want drink, smoke, drugs, get fat, that‚Äôs choice. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm shaming anyone. advocating education, choice. People deserve knowledge take care themselves. That‚Äôs bad thing. save billions health care, improved quality life many. 100% correct. 

If it‚Äôs choice, adult, it. many people don‚Äôt information make choice. It‚Äôs like smoking, drugs. believe it‚Äôs choice, you‚Äôre fully aware consequences, it‚Äôs least informed one. bed.. rip wish well One scientist, expert not, make consensus. mean, makes unrelated article then. it? mode transportation people *choose* go get vaccinated hardly informative anything pandemic vast majority Gen X'ers I've talked say even bother go CVS Walgreens get shot walk in.

I would bet 100:1 odds BS. could believe people saying BS refuse take it, want microchip implant, can't bothered.  day yesterday, US administered almost 1 million fewer vaccines normal. brutal cold front really took toll. Yes... I‚Äôll take mental health advice from... ‚ÄúTeddyRawdog‚Äù prove ur theory take full credit mwuahahaha can't wait get back side concerts, it'll nice get back work finally!   Issue disease lot contagious serious flu.

The flu today healthcare meltdown two months let things go (for now, anyway). We'll see things go we're closer achieving herd immunity. makes faking statements ok you?

That's standard then, mine. Notice argument journalist provides.

""The data also reveals trend among younger people died. 40 account 2.5% COVID deaths. However, almost 40% death records group indicate obesity contributing cause death. ""

That lines perfectly current obesity rate overall US. downplay dangers obesity standard western diet body, current medical understanding obesity visible symptom factors occurring body. disease, body's response another type disorder brought average diet. obese death sentence virus, obvious clue experiencing metabolic disorder syndrome left unchecked contribute poor health death eventually factor, virus otherwise. many people seem want stay locked forever.

This really 0.5 IFR. 

It's black death everyone talking about. Seek help mental health

Before late No. get shot (after risk population) mask goes trash I‚Äôm done distancing. ah aye right, welp wear crowded areas, no? can't rate stay same? can't nurses get sick shit quit render hospitalization stat less meaningful?

The last couple days death count gone down, early pop open beer, valentine's day, president's day, climate collapse going (and weekend), reporting could lagging behind.

People generally predicted winter would bad. bad. suppose almost time lift restrictions westerners get plane third world countries infect without access medical care.

The pandemic weeks. people lost goddamn minds, dude. There's getting point. Yep. Greatest country earth, healthy 90 year old women still boss babes

I hope well end? Covid ain‚Äôt going anywhere. It‚Äôll till day did. might even kill us old age. 

I‚Äôm making case anything here. It‚Äôs way is. I‚Äôm saying people shouldn‚Äòt use declining cases sense security. Cases going get enough population vaccinated. downvoted think right. We've already ordered enough mRNA vaccines almost every American full course. time JNJ rolling we'll vaccinating much higher pace. Plus many sign-up pages say vaccine someone wants certain one likely options.

I think JNJ vaccine demand though. One factor many people really care either way one get. We're biased since /r/Coronavirus subscribers inherently follow COVID vaccines closely. Another factor aversion mRNA vaccines. people know want vaccine trust mRNA vaccines want ""normal"" one. lying doctor. past comments say different job, though they're probably lying too. found friend different grocery store given ""thanks""- chocolates CODE.

What fucking FUCK Source preventing deaths? best research (on 2000 people SA, placebo-controlled) showed almost efficacy preventing mild severe cases - would prevent deaths seems work lighter cases? Yeah comment supposed ironic simultaneously pointing double standards / hypocrisy. Everyone‚Äôs hypocrite. buying group-ptsd developing whopping 0.05% US population dying course year. So, anticipated US want export doses, trusted EU respect. supporting point. think governments get money pay research? suppose richer countries government money spend costly vaccines rollouts? Pretty sure diabetes chances dying coronavirus increase This. 17M Poland Q2-Q4.  know that. Sure, going eating tenderloin lobster every day, processed food really much cheaper (but profitable.)

It take lot time prepare food can't grab box crackers bread spread something top them. see someone enjoying busy.

""Reduce carbon footprint citizen! _need_ fly around private Jet"" 2.5 million deaths 7.5 billion. guess that's insignificant then, eh? ignore move along, right? Hell, even bother seatbelts safety caps medication. lose thousand people every year. Statistically insignificant, bother? collegues tested every 2 weeks. became unwell annual leave asked test every close contact would additional testing. Would nice linked source... never gave fuck anyone outside social circle. never understand people pretend care people know. understand virtue signalling aspect. Wow, mean turns he‚Äôs selfish, hypocritical piece shit?

Who knew? another virus soon enough hit 1.72M Drives nuts. society supposed do, yet complain way fixed can't nice things. us, it‚Äôs always sniffles

Vast majority us. Quiet, manlet. can't say Covid-19 young healthy person? virus next effect me, instead I'm almost forced get vaccine (majority people even want this) otherwise can't much. Well show one viewpoint they‚Äôd get clicks people viewpoint Regardless, deserve vaccine keep dying fit person (who statistically shit worry covid) deserves vaccine hang friends without mask months sooner. goals different. life matters inconvenience. comment energy 'as introvert love lockdowns'. Yeah, Korea slow going get vaccination set here. I'm optimistic there's fantastically strong healthcare infrastructure, maddening vaccines rolling yet.

Testing insanely easy though we're better Japan, least? feeling Korea gonna hit post-Lunar new year surge though anyone info compliance restrictions?

It seems everyday goes friends, family coworkers meeting (not parties, hang out) tbh willpower keep indoors isolated slipping.

Last time friends last time restrictions reduced cases 200 daily country, less 10 day local county. why? I'm New Zealand right now, appart quality life 7 weeks lockdown, death toll 26. less healthy fit 90 yr-old. death rate 0.4% worth locking for?

1. there
2. Yes is. expectations, mean here. splitting hairs point. genomic sequencing random samples demonstrates claim true. last surge caused B117 (or SA/Brazil variant). Numerous experts said repetitively. 

One many reasons fall/winter wave weather. Coronaviruses respiratory pathogens like spread colder months. Colder, drier air facilitates spread respiratory droplets. contrast, humid air better breaking virus air. Also, people spend time indoors windows shut colder weather, creates opportunities spread.

Get people, healthcare workers, N95 masks. literally [30 million US-made N95 cant ventilation workplaces apartments, using windows, HEPA filters UV. many apartment buildings HVAC systems share air neighboring apartments? recent study said half current dose Moderna effective full? think testing 50ug vs current 100ug. don‚Äôt know enough would fit in, could potentially double Moderna output overnight? opinion agree with

Trust opinion disagree with

Lol dumb totally right. exact perspective logic slightly different threshold point becomes ""enough enough"".

Sad point pandemic (and even now) could turn entire thing around ""back normal"" period weeks/a months (like many countries accomplished) actual full scale lockdown consisting closing non-essential businesses restricting people homes, providing everyone aid needed make possible. Like shit never needed drag long anyways. yet people saying enough enough ones advocating policies made drag longer. Florida gets bad wrap honestly aren‚Äôt worse states harsher lockdowns. hospitals never actually got overran either. happened state, knowledge. &lt;triggering dude, lady, man, don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm trying argue you. You‚Äôre looking offended, doesn‚Äôt take much. You‚Äôre probably blast parties /s world still ruled lab accident (Detrick Fort) origin Covid U.S. transparent. Prescription glasses covered all. That's lie, I've pay mine contact lenses specifically need - otherwise I'd left blind eventually. Go india I‚Äôm US don‚Äôt really follow individual states covid numbers. Florida‚Äôs numbers compare similar size/density states? can't afford eat healthy. mean can, nation whole can't. need get corn wheat. happens everyone starts eating 1/10th corn used to? Maybe try read commenting change? Inspite clickbaity headline, article balanced in-depth provides perspectives lot experts. Good luck getting US change course. Nov/Dec/Jan happened local Fed agencies taking ""strictest"" measures (that politically feasible). 

Apologies rest world variants we're growing spreading... Asians. (I American seems like Japan China begun vaccinating people country, Asian countries eliminated virus borders like Taiwan Vietnam done, many lot active community transmission cases like South Korea Japan). Aside giving China, NK this. I'm doubtful technology make mRNA vaccine, let alone distribute it. No, it‚Äôs portions. Calories. That‚Äôs it.

Jump YouTube go videos comparing food sizes American chains US countries.

It‚Äôs portions. full it. it‚Äôs said done follow money. I‚Äôm sure hands honeypot idea examples, know example that:

(1) many vaccines minimum interval doses. Maybe maximize efficacy dangerous doses close time, know.

(2) said mRNA vaccines cause severe side effects people previously virus (because already antibodies, vaccine makes make many antibodies creates effects). side effects real problem case anyway, obvious several vaccines level antibodies could even higher could start serious problem point.

Of course might bollocks, point know (i.e., saying, layman perspective obvious, found information it). It‚Äôs okay everyday kid twice, uphill ways! arrived Germany high-risk area* would walk six miles, would walk six more, old woman gets vaccination right inside door... Desperation... they've Trump + COVID + mostly captive audience better part year now. One things pretty much gone, second slowly surely coming end, third soon spending lot time people, seeking forms entertainment, plain enjoying time tv tablet engaging doom scrolling anxiety marathons.

So yeah, eyeballs news media likely plummeting record five year lows northern hemisphere begins exit winter.  Shag Carpet Chewbacca's porn name. Honestly point stop caring ""grandmas."" year? 1.4k stimulus? Fucking joke is. Im young, I've done part older person (23.) Dont see friends, dont date, work. Got covid anyway grocery shit.

Im exhausted sacrificing pre covid industry worked develop loved portion vastly retired. Fuck. makes feel like Im bad person much terrible social isolation what? 

No restriction making politicians advocating epidemiologists taken fucking pay cut. hate care anymore. Climate change, ludicrous socioeconomic inequality, lack decency queer POC, comes generation protecting. 

I dont understand im treated like human anymore

Im fucking vector disease eyes people making full salary getting work home ain‚Äôt complaining NZ. complaining stupid article like media always is, doom gloom. reason extend lockdown NZ health officials know ending. immune system neat. 

The flu rare year I've barely left house suspect got flu. 6 weeks flu shot went bed feeling bit woke fever 101 arm super sore vaccine location. Went back bed. 

Next morning woke fever mild arm pain vaccine location rest day it. can't SEE things listed...except physical disability sometimes can't even see looking someone. I've never done outside work school. can't believe social circles families actually tried make event zoom parties. Well then, let‚Äôs see expertise know better. It‚Äôd better based something besides wishing really hard. FYI actually want scientists change minds get better information. don‚Äôt believe gods, maybe that‚Äôs problem. seasonal influenza also increases risk fetal women careful way non pandemic times. EU could blocked exports countries part supply chain (or replaceable). still didn't. incorrect things here. First all, younger healthier likely strong reaction 


I'll rate mostly true. Super old weak dropping like flies vaccine. negate point, people still compressed shorter time window; also supermarkets essential stores. Nope Im little concerned dropping rate first dose shots. sure due weather hitting states hard, holiday, states getting arms shipping much. 827k first dose shots 7day rolling vs. peak 989k 2/12

I would like see first dose rate upped 1.2-1.5 million ""Pfizer"" vaccine actually Biontech vaccine, developed German company. Sincere question: new cases deaths falling fast vaccinations? come literally reason would want that? Especially ignoring existence Taiwan wouldn‚Äôt anything hurt knowledge virus implementation policy combat it? I‚Äôll wait enlightening response. Yeah phenomenon accepted part viral transmission. Isn‚Äôt virus evolves enough jump species start spreading close contacts? mean shouldn‚Äôt Covid human-to-human transmission virus invaluable evolving... would think that? Normal respiratory illness season lasts weeks. fact February usually peak Flu season. Hell, think COVID last year: March nightmare New York City. Holidays seem much likely seasonality. suppose we'll see cold snap drives case counts way next week. think don‚Äôt metric add countless untested asymptomatic cases variable. 

I‚Äôm sure missing factors conspicuous dropping large regions world, simultaneously. earth pseudo science twaddle lol. probably lot believe Instagram lies vaccines That‚Äôs opinion lol reasonable guidelines set forth instead rigid rules selfish people always ruin everyone else. fuck this?

Must dumbest thing I've ever read website thats saying something. Per google, roughly 49.2 million people 65. we've given doses fit age group, large portion vaccines went healthcare workers wide age range. 

I agree, would interesting see demographics. proven temperature checks catch cases (on top that, take ibuprofen lower fever) forehead thermometers notoriously inaccurate. likely security theater lets also remember appr. 70 people ICU April 2020. less 50 time. moment 30. Uusimaa whole country. 17 Uusimaa moment. 

1/3 patients treated ICU Finland even need ventilator (intubation/non-invasive ventilation) 200 ventilators ordered panic last spring used all. (Well maybe the've taken advantage new resources replaced older machines new ones no, needed extra ICU beds extra ventilators pandemic.)

723 people died, median age still 84 older life expectancy (81 yrs) extra mortality caused coronavirus 2020. actually data website go demographics designed cause fear. report rare things like Kawasaki - might well lightening strikes shark attacks - something afraid of, use studies say ‚Äòmay‚Äô ‚Äòcould‚Äô evidence rather studies actually say - don‚Äôt know. 

As far masks, agree studies - cloth masks might provide limited protection aren‚Äôt much value social distancing can‚Äôt followed, evidence poor positive effect. However cost wearing mask low, benefit might exist, problem them. Yea,okay 

You opinion mine. 

Playing scrabble gran now. 

She said, she‚Äôd hope I‚Äôd stop her. protect larry david principal mode people infected SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causes COVID-19) exposure respiratory droplets carrying infectious virus.

Hope helps, stay safe called dendritic cells. cells go around pick things like. Hmm; spike protein recognize one lungs cells died? Yeah I'll grab dude; thanks. Dendritic cells collect spike proteins way; wave white blood cells; saying ""Peeps! here; weird thing. Come take look try figure nullify it!"" b-lymphocytes (i think, sure) do; check dendritic cells, see try figure thing cancel them.

The vaccines either deliver protein (spike protein) dendritic cells; pick up. mRNA stuff too; dendritic cells pick up; actually code makes dendritic cell produce spike proteins.

I'm guessing efficcacy higher; although harder get mrna cell; produce much spike proteins amount dendritic cells pick limited supply.

Both vaccines similar; mrna vaccine depends rna synthesising capability; whereas protein vaccine depends protein synthesising capability. Manifacturing RNA much easier scale, sort universal tool. protein; need modify bacteria/yeast first; harwast them. rna; wel printers stuff. studies shown virtual schooling less effective socially distanced, in-person learning masks everyone? That‚Äôs weak proof dude. got perfect attendance award high school. Luckily never remember going school sick, would definitely think twice admirable goal now. Why? vaccines render severe disease rare hospitals room treat anyone, need zero COVID? never zero flu since 1918 last comment said, agree. That's harmful. original comment said talking cleaning regimen, based original comment of.

If crowd leave house leaves crowd alone, crowd leaves alone, issue. issue stay homes try shame social livers, social livers try shame stay homes, two sides coin.

I'm agreeing part, initial comment convey actual problem was. Oh look covid denial. Can't imagine children. Lots covid trolls yall seem relate every troll personal connection experience they're usually fake. Worst idea seen. Making lives worth living everyone (supposedly) save lives. Terrible idea. Zeroing without vaccines means even Chinese measures, 24/7 surveillance public, personal freedom... robot get ill, worth becoming robot tho? mass self cannot wait parents jabbed go back licking door knobs letting strangers spit mouth like one time US better Europe. Soak moment glory, fellow Americans. Fine, there's general pattern (illustrated comment) people write strange wrong thing says ""gaffe."" insulting. sort issues now? Teachers important child... wait, what? Reddit: fuck sake let **the WHO** job need know truth! 

I'm pretty sure Reddit called *independent* investigation. data we'll data create. I‚Äôve lost faith subreddit good conversation Oh god, that's special kind cringe. point comedy show there's laughter! Mine August 23, hope enough people vaccinated then. Yeah ""Sinds beginning guess"" means February 10th 2021, days ago. 

And that's production active ingredients, actual vials. 

Nice misinformation posting here. POTS heterogeneous condition impacting autonomic nervous system causing dysfunction thereof. take off, mean become dominant strain. cases necessarily increase. Ontario genetic sequencing basically anywhere else world (we currently sequencing every positive test), may bit biased, Toronto Peel 5-10% cases British variant. I‚Äôd imagine Europe US would similar higher number much sequencing Ontario does. 

And clear, I‚Äôm using argument reopening: can‚Äôt keep closed protect variant already quite prevalent community. fact, I‚Äôm quite confident reopen without causing spike even British variant widespread. stay home got covid?

Seriously though, stop taking sort precaution starting see improvements don‚Äôt right reproduce. even close right reproduce. say constitution - country - you‚Äôre right reproduce? UN say people right reproduce? obligation reproduce? 

How lead genocide? Genocide sterilization murdering group. isn‚Äôt paying another group.

A living wage variable changes circumstance circumstance. That‚Äôs trade labor wage. OP's general point correct... look World War 1 want better analogy. Politicians said war would last year so, tens millions young men spent *years* wallowing muddy trenches.

Crises pre-defined shelf life. might infect students zoom cl? Oh look happen UN peacekeeper would look üôÜ help confusion three vaccines listed even *applied* approval yet. Or, err, guess J&amp;J applied approval yesterday missed it. That's totally different suggestion simply saying something ethical volunteers willing it. Also, pointing title clickbait article inaccurate way ethical - right, studying people vaccine. still probably unethical IMO, professional (pharmacist scientist) sat boards still currently ethics reviews clinical trials. case, article also say vaccines contributing? 10% NY gotten first dose. really think % people infected *that* much higher? can. guidelines based probability infection. Probability lower certain threshold within 6 ft someone 15 minutes, definitely still get it. Yeah got point. mention get free healthcare really good care yeahh surprised low.  mean, COVID hospitalizations mostly impact people 75 years old right? old people getting bold, tripping? Shout independent creating worst fucking article title this. USA fucked many ways...  put together list friends/acquaintances 50 years old know covid. 44 could think 43 described similar mild flu. 44th one died. 


I point here. thought I'd add anecdote. Early many worried virus spreading quickly multigenerational families one house. 

Now seems single parents need work exist. Roger Roger not? can't expect people know edited it. mean, optimally acknowledges himself, still is.

The comment upvoted top covid deniers, every, single thread. Especially since absolutely way British variant doesn‚Äôt take off.

Is taking anywhere right now? [Maybe UK accidentally double negative? moroccan living Europe, stop using demeaning outdated terms like first third world countries . he's definitely trolling lol Supply maybe?
Not sure. really. last month, 130k confirmed cases within US military. Mind number likely double triple that. Even using 130k number though, total 17 died. .013%, 99.987% survived. 

Not much ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù happening especially consider asymptomatic cases likely make mortality rate even lower. Military skews younger healthy, much less likely die even get serious issues COVID links yellow journalism? don‚Äôt believe them? anti-masker too? Wtf interview.

Bullshit. UK government continues learn NOTHING countries already this, finding problems. Rude presumptuous. wonderful day. technology replicate mRNA maybe, make vaccines. far involved vaccines mRNA Define ""race"" then. According definition googled, race ""a group people sharing culture, history, language, etc.; ethnic group."" I‚Äôd interested see data length severity spikes different areas. feel like spike reaches certain level tipping point people‚Äôs behaviors, point reached people make changes. example, company sent us home right peak spike, even though locality didn‚Äôt introduce restrictions impacted them. business impact disruptive anyone site didn‚Äôt need be. There‚Äôs science proves teachers elevated risk

If someone think supports claim, please post mean entitled boomers discipline entitled boomers discipline?

You say. low hanging fruit shit America anything everything 4 years now. Much deservedly, sure. Switzerland well. Workplaces: lol Nah  Sinds beginning guess. Biontech 3 production sites Europe making vaccine. Pfizer one site Belgium. Biontech opened facility Germany make 750 million doses year. lot unpack there, whole pile assumptions part.

Your first paragraph completely ignores half story - families two working parents **already** exposed COVID, they're **already** exposing others, they're using child care kind. Whether that's daycare center (no better school except providers unionized like teachers) they're relative watch kids (sometimes grandma) one parents dropped workforce. worse, nobody watching Who's going bear costs litigation, settlement, etc

Why would litigation all? teacher, afraid job, quit. profession earth - grocery workers, security guards, engineers, construction workers, whatever, could even dream going work, catching virus endemic among general population, suing employer. fantasy land living think would acceptable course action? can't job medical reasons, world cannot stop you. Instead, need go disability find different job acceptable risk profile (or, case, risk profile perceive better, whether actuality not). can

Just **what**? Open schools? That's backwards know - default natural state schools **OPEN** **CLOSED**. question - ""We could close schools potentially reduce risk, we?"" question - ""Should continue deprive children families important developmental, educational, social support expect school system bowing pressure teachers unions flimsy what-if arguments statistical US terrible internets, let alone equipping children succeed.

And want make worse. would like second this. 

Fuuuuuuuck Sure, sounds good. bumping list then? don‚Äôt think unions corrupt, know may never much leverage again. That‚Äôs theory, anyway. sure heard normal December 2021. older overweight people were, likely among 20 per cent exhaled 80 per cent aerosol droplets

That's quite different headline.  epigenetic changes pushed virus affected organs replication understood, discussed much. ethics board approved it, medical studies work? getting approved medical ethical boards? Yes, North Korea strategy... threaten nuclear war, claim credit peace nuclear war happen. Lol know, right? Dude probably never met toddler. US lawless, come EU that's getting shafted corporations according you? think would lawless US would experiencing delays, good old yUrOpE. 

But see anti-American yuRoPEaN nationalist peddle garbage vain attempt make feel better. Good luck Hans. They're infected covid limited specific way. remember sub one. One doomerism one rationalish. swapped around mid March. forget now. We've seen worked past. What‚Äôs controversial saying teachers vaccinated? That‚Äôs safest route least risk. WTF missing? People schooling online since August likely schools won‚Äôt open year several places would almost April happens WTF would point?

You‚Äôll look shitty kids til next August..sorry! There..that‚Äôs immunity (also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity) form indirect protection infectious disease occur diseases sufficient percentage population become immune infection, whether vaccination previous infections, thereby reducing likelihood infection individuals lack immunity.

Here literally first sentence Wikipedia article herd immunity. Well shit. going unleash crotch goblins teachers, make sure teachers safe. Lol, don‚Äôt friends them. see folks monster tattoos, about. I‚Äôm always amazed. People logos cars. don‚Äôt drink it. remember pulled truck giving away, promotions one day. walking by, tried hand one. looked confused wouldn‚Äôt take it. Yes. take vaccinate enough people. thing highly airborne, fuck runs study shows sign airborne? fucking middle school science lab could better. Boiling someone's obesity ""eliminate fast food"" ""a lot people care, never will"" shows things. 

One, probably never struggled weight. probably tie someone's weight self worth. 

Two, uneducated topic trying real hard show semblance knowledge authority on. if, 10 years road turns vaccine sterilized can't kids?

So? trying a-hole that's literally minor inconvenience things considered. able conceive literally end world. bullshit

Jesus Christ provide actual fucking science

If obese people huge comorbitities USA would far surpassing EU nations deaths per capita... arent He's referring ""At least three COVID-19 investigators linked Chinese-institutions"" Probably not.
You would infected tons people considering contagious virus is. I‚Äôm floridian, basically completely open months. Hell, even peak restrictions bars palm beach county letting people back. kind speakeasy feel. agree; NK absolutely facilities replicate, store distribute Pfizer vaccine.

(As said another comment, I've worked biotech/pharma years I'm willing bet dinky insulin production facility work probably costs maintain operate better chunk NK's ballistic missile program.)

I'm certain NK attempted steal data order sell third party; NK simply able anything data otherwise. viruses don‚Äôt scale way

More population contact scales vastly win viral spread... New Zealand shut schools 2 weeks massively lower spread us awuldnhave fly handle think allergies contagious wasn't. closely related RaTG13, bat coronavirus discovered Wuhan Institute Virology scientists expedition southern China 2013. fact, basically identical RaTG13 two major differences:

* artificial-looking R-R-A-R furin cleavage site. Per National Taiwan Univerisity's professor Fang Chi-tai, natural virus would ""unlikely four amino acids added once"". Researchers grafting furin cleavage sites onto coronaviruses decades, known could make viruses likely infect human cells.

* spike protein appears lifted wholesale pangolin coronavirus, discovered Chinese authorities confiscated sick pangolins smugglers March 2019. Researchers also substituting spike proteins coronaviruses decades experiment making infect different species. fuck people think USA weld people‚Äôs doors shut? communist military govenrment ludicrously corrupt arrests people walking dogs? Fuck guys. China Vietnam Thailand govenrment responses acceptable fucking life. enjoy actually freedom actual constitution Imagine treated food like that. Simple, smooth brains can't distinguish differences absence evidence evidence absence.

It's either raging hate boner China caused blood leaves brain. thanks shedding light EU funding variants, understood chunk would go toward genetic sequencing helpful. 

The article read (just rechecked) said 150m research additional 75m help sequencing Point remind know fuck talking about. respected authority pathogens, ya gotta kinda get shit together making worldwide announcements.

Let's say, day 1, respected source proclaims world:

#We evidence masks effective

While may true based whatever shit study conducted, trusted credible source fuck up. Another one, cool. literally said nothing diet exercising. actually science says literally run eating. ""bad diet"" subjective average person. apparently vaccinations start late month. Ya. ducking intrusive actually clock government. mention fucked requirement phone thus phone plan exist. estranged family get new phone plan month? get fucked ya? Isn‚Äôt common cold coronavirus? Next Christmas completely unacceptable timeline. vulnerable vaccinated April so, point longer risk hospitals overwhelmed. Everyone wants vaccine able get one summer. People going give another full year this. Nice! source that? (I heard before) actually does. tried also. Ok, bad. press release using positive wording - although reasonable believe PCR-negative status means vast reduction transmission. Thank correcting everyone reading this! Hey booze I'm drinking reduces blood sugar! means .... booze! every state different system causing weird situations like parents live 20 mi away different state can't get vaccinated yet. lived state could.

Is really weird? Different states different laws. I'm sure well aware live 20 minutes another state. parents also can't go state get driver's license. means herd immunity kicking June. Yup. Can't outrun bad diet. medical background whatsoever I'm going claim judge that. point people prefer one other, depicted news sounds like BioNtech best moment,

Ah fair enough. Yes German contacts family say you, they've heard BioNtech best preference. Seems larger supply compared Moderna Moderna get much attention since Germany barely got any, normal people want one recognise name heard working I'm gonna take whichever get first sure would prefer get BioNtech one.

Make sense. thanks shedding light EU funding variants,. I'm worried, think fine cases drop plenty summer, even ittle vaccination. see plays comes back. flu also causes smell lose rates timeframe covid, one seems give fuck perpspecive anymor e  Yes, good news.

No, transmission reduced 67%, unspecified significant analysis also showed potential vaccine reduce asymptomatic transmission virus, based weekly swabs obtained volunteers UK trial. data showed PCR positive readings reduced 67% (CI: 49%, 78%) single dose, 50% (CI: 38% 59%) two dose regimen, supporting substantial impact transmission virus.

PCR positive readings: -67%

Transmission: substantial impact (unspecified)

I idea link press release gave original scientific paper source. walk? That's like weight big engined motorbike... think it‚Äôs blood sugar level matters weight. eat less carbohydrates blood glucose gets lower week week, weight loss came it. None doable all.  need keep washing hands rest life. work remotely essential company ridiculous

Literally tension me, immunesuppressed person clue I'll vaccinated, therapist, sees clients zoom gotten ""healthcare worker."" fact _defended it!_ gahh!! I‚Äôd love move on. many us legally cannot return normal. Hey thanks response. Definitely makes ton sense. expressing reporting would main response. question underreporting real issue, severity virus worth drastically changed would operates, (which we‚Äôve seen, looks like is) wouldn‚Äôt see people dying left right rural areas? 

I understand points made absolutely contribute numbers. time, India 4/10ths cases US 969% higher population density. numbers don‚Äôt make sense even mass cases aren‚Äôt reported.

And many cases underreported, mean bad really it? biggest issue cases underreported wouldn‚Äôt eventually become apparently absurd amount people rural areas seemingly healthy dropping dead? mean it‚Äôs shut entire countries multiple times, it‚Äôs worthy severity, mass unreported cases would naturally bring public eye eventually. amount cases would take skew percentages much, hasn‚Äôt center global news and/or explanation bunch ‚Äúthis probably why, we‚Äôre sure‚Äù there‚Äôs two possibilities.

1. ‚Äúexperts‚Äù know moment clearly isn‚Äôt worth much, drastically change short amount time
2. country population density India number unreported cases would probably assume looking percentages ones really noticed. Meaning really isn‚Äôt severe, else we‚Äôd probably looking it‚Äôs effect poorer/more rural too.

This John Hopkins page linked subreddit also says China less cases individual countries: Qatar, Libya, Oman, Slovenia, Costa Rica, IRELAND. anyone logical reasoning actually believe China less cases Ireland? MANY THINGS! Fuck country doesn‚Äôt learn mistakes. biggest one don‚Äôt use private security guards likely Indian immigrants live multi generational/multi family dwellings. Fuck me, go r/UnitedKingdom subreddit confronted hundreds nutters. gotta get head 99% cases hard lockdown going shit end coronavirus. live priority age group. Depending fast America finishes up, may get vaccinated sometime July September. sister's husband got week ago. seen since Christmas so, chance there.. he's social person. gone out.. work, machine maintenance job, public job. sister fine. Never got it. come from?

Im worried going slow. I'm worried fatness going liability, evidence points that. way force refusing vax cut social privileges. 

That sounds ideal, never happen. Unless think congress going somehow enact that, corporations small businesses _never_ voluntarily gatekeep services. Businesses hurting, _last_ thing want tell subset potential customers, things opening back up, ""actually no, want money!"" 

To date, I've yet hear single company sued spreading covid (besides event venues getting legal trouble flouting lockdown rules, separate issue), there's ""stick"" scenario sure shit ""carrot."" highly doubt case would make court proving causality community transmission airborne disease extremely tenuous. 

So yea, might huge problem anti-vaxxers. alone probably big driving force behind annual boosters since it'll ever-present gaping hole herd immunity strategy. medical background whatsoever I'm going claim judge that. point people prefer one other, depicted news sounds like BioNtech best moment, Moderna get much attention since Germany barely got any, normal people want one recognise name heard working best. also like people say take vaccines could choose take one seems like best. I'm gonna take whichever get first sure would prefer get BioNtech one.

Regarding plan, idk heard things EU announced provide ‚Ç¨150m research adjusting new virus variants, I'd guess getting that. Back day didn‚Äôt planks wood...... mean whole teams undergrads (including WHO) swab bat anuses look new pathogens.... totally realm possibility exposure field testing. mean it‚Äôs also reasonable weigh societal costs ailments almost exclusively attack old people low life expectancy

It‚Äôs legitimatly reasonable say disease killing old people mostly retired versus young kids legitimatly finite period ability learn, viewed different

Bro we've seen last year little works. Older people go get groceries, go pharmacy, doctor's appts, etc. 60 isolating taking precautions cared safety, need take precautions. We're large percentage population severely risk. wedding last year directly linked 9 elderly people attendance still died. get choose go public without mask really killing grandma next state? 

My grandmother died nursing home someone, somewhere decided wear mask. We've seen thing spreads year presymptomatic people. COVID, yet, go out, infect someone, bring state grandmother died, many degrees away death. certainly closer death I'm comfortable being. nursing homes locked elderly health conditions careful?

They are. That's still happening. clearly enough because, know, 500k people dead? whole thing become groupthink way mind boggling. think part people really understand risk heavily concentrated elderly infirm. widely understood think would even wider dissent.

And start realize media absolutely intention reporting facts data, reality, trying get clicks outrageous things so.

There glimmer truth hope first time since beginning madness. scientists start saying positive teens continue, think beginning Spring looking lot brighter makes sense take conservative position good evidence believe otherwise. Everyone freaking endorsing pre print papers ridiculous. first batch study participants vaccinated establish baseline response comparing vaccine effectiveness later on.

Despite that, critically important research. done vaccine approval first place could've rolled months earlier saved many thousands lives. Instead gave people placebo sent community rampant transmission, counting get infected, practically thing takes longer. teachers home.

Technically Astrazeneca HQ sweden make part british large operations UK. Probably science says teacher school risky might fear. definitely riskier sitting home everything opportunity cost - injecting someone 65 healthy 35 year old teacher save lives net positive state might choose that. society worry learning online hurting kids. 

Now people might agree thinking maybe think science schools open conclusive one need take risk (though plenty already say prioritized). reason - CDC bodies claimed relatively safe classroom certain precautions taken even without vaccine. great job reporting facility infections. That‚Äôs ‚Äúseemed‚Äù like well. priority supply, arrange people line order want matter supply actually distribute. trying say media coverage positive bias towards her? get lot downvotes.

(Doesn't mean think justified, apathy votingblock problem. especially huge amount single issue voters.) point comment? jerk someone seeking info advice **Clarifications Rantings**

Things got little political direction last week, personal attacks levied. Unless sent two direct messages, aimed you.

There lots confusion posts, thinking I'm anti-restrictions whatever. Actually, I've getting sides.

The virus serious business. kills people. makes people sick long time. people lose sense smell/taste. people get sick all, *no idea* why. Yes, I'm ignoring age distribution stuff here, know people every age *can* get really sick. really want loss smell taste happen me. That's keeps motivated mask distance. think ignore danger virus, *at all*. 

Just decided distance follow rules, mean get make decision people too. Respect choices, even they're *terrible* choices. *so ignorant, purpose, spite me* there's nothing it. people chosen stop distancing they're vaccinated, that's fine, long respect people's choices.

The virus made lab. That's conspiracy theory garbage, know it. Even made lab, what? cares? you? humanity, ability fight virus, people who've lost loved one? Nothing spread hate. Give up. 

If think ""defending"" China, beyond help.

About - I'm ""anti-lockdown"" ""pro-lockdown"". US, think we've ""lockdown"", we've restrictions, minimal ones that. lockdown like NZ China, think we'd better place (fewer deaths). hand I'm *totally* convinced effective people think. encourage people ""follow rules"" guidelines whatever. Masking easy, yeah, suck, anymore. I'm ""pro-mask"" point. seem work, myriad reasons. Double masking dumb, idea comes good intentions. Experts [trying hardest, heck, trying EVERYTHING protect people deadly virus. really difficult you, I'm sorry. 

Please assume troll argue conservative subs I'm conservative. I'll get banned eventually.

I'm sorry go there, people bugging shit me. least Walmart (in experience), upfront straightforward saying something stock rather say confidentally think backtrack that. Teaching shouldn‚Äôt seen marketplace metaphor - teaching infrastructure.

I understand completely say that... infrastructure neglected. much United States, been. free market opens competition services, mobility unhappy situation reason. mention vaccinating participants first part completed? agree definitive, think there's evidence support idea initial volunteers unvaccinated. Lauterbach call Merkel tell extend lockdown :-) honestly even understand argument people thinking. people talk even say anything. ask simple questions like, teachers vaccinated, vaccinated teachers teach classrooms, would take open classroom, answer ""the risk increased"" answer questions. **Can vaccinated people spread virus?**

Any answer get either ""yes"" ""no"" wrong, now. ""maybe, probably not"", going way long time.

In order answer question scientifically, would require ""challenge study"" vaccinated unvaccinated people deliberately exposed virus see transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns deliberate exposure prevent us performing studies humans. reason vaccine trials took long, can't deliberately infect people see need hospitalization die. 

(EDIT: Well, looks like [spoke studies hamsters, results looked pretty bad. able spread it. hamsters greet touching noses like time. Humans really (do you?). similar studies monkeys results look really good.

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance. Doctors, scientists, regulators careful language subject, would argue they're careful. said, say ""vaccinated people cannot spread virus"", find situations vaccinated people spread virus, would end worse hedge while. least me, way they're framing seems pretty reasonable, put shoes.

**Additional Thoughts/Cool likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[Delayed second doses might least though evidence mRNA vaccine trials suggest 6 weeks better least acceptable. problem wait longer second dose, therefore, full protection. says maximum interval doses, [Pfizer says 6 

[A happy may prevent severe [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need mutation analogy:**

The spike protein coded 3,831 base pairs. mean?

Well, like lego sculpture 3,831 words instructions build it, writer super-detailed explaining motion piece.  

In analogy, immune system makes lego pieces (antibodies) attach pair exposed bumps lego sculpture. We'll say 40 pairs exposed example.

A variant instructions change one words. Sometimes photocopier instructions page gets tiny smudge. could really bad sometimes, especially critical word phrase, like ""left"" ""repeat six times"" description particularly detailed lego piece. Color might always matter, size would.

Out 3,831 words, many change much every one 40 spots longer there? probably lot.

But wait, many words change make whole sculpture really different, work sculpture anymore? Really many they're right spots, right? variants suck viruses; rare mistake would make instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty minor.

**Booster questions think about, answers**

(note: there's difference ""boost"" ""booster"" needs understood.)

(also, what's term mixture sequences, heterogenous? doubt term overthinking?)

(also also, I'm convinced we're definitely going need boosters, fun think about.)

Could booster shot replace second dose prime/boost regimen?

Should booster shot use one sequence mRNA (or identical spike proteins), both/multiple?

For future vaccines, sequence/spike prime/boost different? four spikes/sequences, would make sense two each, four each?

How much trust mutation modeling here? anticipate future mutations include them? good enough yet?

Do need give non-booster doses people recovered infection?

Could ""stretch"" doses mRNA booster priming vaccine that's easier manufacture, maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), boost mRNA booster? Could better faster prime current mRNA sequence boost updated ChAdOx1? vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing infection, subsequent variant exposed broaden immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). they'll good broad immunity variety variants, seems likely indication catch spread virus well future. thing happens someone vaccinated exposed new variant. immunity broadened strengthened subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. remember, many people less likely spread virus, pretty unlikely reduced level spread sufficient sustain virus way seen past year. variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing mind changed new information though, take gospel. 

Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know!

Oh goodness. like read comments something...  Pretty sure messaging regarding herd immunity things hasn‚Äôt entirely honest Vaccines. Old people risk getting shots reason drag hospitals clear deaths crater.

We looking bad flu season on. People need able decide risks they're comfortable with. people vaccinated spread virus?

No lockdowns, masks social distancing. Looks like we‚Äôve mugged off. think likely: /day cases NY 1.5x higher winter March 2020, /day deaths 5x lower? testing capacity first wave case numbers highly innaccurate? ü§î
 
 
Or global brain explain death graphs looking completely different? think seeing months worth decline cases due winter storm couple days ago? know Canada Ontario Quebec, right? us lockdown like guys. I'm B.C. Btw. know kids Teacher preexisting condition? Also, talking Schools open, saying hybrid half kids go one part week, half another part, time. people act like hybrid kuds School, Teacher still walking room likely poorly ventilated, 15 kids instead 30. least elementary level kids take masks eat inside classroom. Maybe breaking news seriously think wait couple months entire country vaccinated reopen schools. know it‚Äôs massive strain parents families kids homeschooling right online schooling several months general it‚Äôs better safe sorry comes stuff virus mutating quickly finding new contagious strains US.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it‚Äôs anyone wants hear. need get adults vaccinated determine whether it‚Äôs safe vaccinate kids coronavirus vaccine reopen schools. thousands people many many different households one building school environment it‚Äôs dangerous contagious pandemic schools open vaccines everyone need prioritized entire country vaccinated talk re-opening schools.

&amp;#x200B;

Not hit heard immunity opinion, That‚Äôs way really keep kids teachers safe well families entirety American population.

&amp;#x200B;

And I‚Äôm talking places higher transmission rates infection rates simply large school systems equal infections usually people coming contact other. Plus inability ""western"" vaccines take account needs LATAM production schemes. Less teachers overall = money poor souls left prop system nearly year plan ahead antibody test vaccine recipients. fact yet another example government completely incompetent managing this, anything else matter.

Antibody testing waste resources all. Best case scenario, ration dose someone actually needs it. Worst case scenario, get accurate measurement prevalent immunity population already, helps figure close herd immunity already. would closest thing large scale random sample far. jab sounds much pleasant shot

Not American ears. jab sounds sharp unpleasant me, whereas shot little needle. They're alive. say system can't plan anything week ""fine"". represents 6% total country's population. Vaccination started 3 weeks ago, daily vaccination rollout recently around 150-200k doses. Active cases stand 9596 February 17th VA, there's initiative hire in-person ""classroom monitors,"" teacher remains home teaches virtually. considered part-time 35 hrs/week pays ~$15/hr basically glorified babysitter (the teacher's words, mine). 
  
While sounds like decent compromise immunocompromised teachers, idea anyone highschool diploma (no childhood teaching experience needed) could patience, ability keep kids line focused teacher sounds impossible, especially low wage benefits (compared wages teacher's aide). Online school bad, 9 classes day (from 7 4 pm) migraine bad lay bad 2 days :( friends least moved discord honestly I‚Äôm sick even don‚Äôt join anymore. zoom five hours day university, I‚Äôm currently looking jobs zoom interviews, it‚Äôs mandatory Zoom City around clock me. zooming fun top that. It‚Äôs draining complete bore. Yeah. open quickly, people start travel mingle people normally with, unless we're vaccinated, likely see significant uptick cases. Everyone's pretty much within COVID bubble whether household, household/home/grocery store small circle friends. likely burned within bubbles.

But start intermingle again, opens another worms. Especially since people less likely careful. Embrace new body! saying goes hope shallow fear. Personally, edge towards what's practicable. loosely believe anything comes directly social media mainstream media. If, instance, Doctor John Campbell (pretty well respected medical practitioner Teacher. Great daily updates YouTube channel.) turning nose incredulity fact UK government advise mask usage back March 2020, I'm going listen BBC telling we'll lockdown weeks - hand advising, alongside government, 1.7 million people shielding start shielding again. sadly believe old rona quite done us yet. 1000 deaths day still UK 10k 15k new ""recorded"" infections. think new strains SAGE spooked fear evade vaccines, hence serge testing, no, edge bets, get N95 higher. BTW, blagged antibody test last week gov website, took test I've negative antibody result. live heart city 300k people 30% least population rona. Resprator masks work experience, literally work. made flippent comment post worry folk getting disease. Lost friends family it. Watched half street taken away blue lights. make light it. Indoor, unventilated spaces moving humanity breeding grounds rona. cloth mask safe, simple, really. takes little 10 particulates C19 make ill, think that. Sorry wall words. think charitable way say people willing accept sacrifices trajectory 75%-80% people get vaccinated pandemic over, willing accept sacrifices indefinitely there's telling we'll get pandemic control. I'm not. Fauci head said tomorrow ""well, vaccines work more; guess back drawing board,"" I'm basically done, lot people mask social distancing police since day one.

&amp;#x200B;

Put another way - leading health authorities said COVID-19 serious threat 20 years stay home keep kids school cancel in-person social engagements time, would it? won't. sort mental deadline, deadline 1 year. Unironically yeah got $800 free medical checkups getting Eli Lilly‚Äôs drug Look operation warp speed find much USA Invested get 4 vaccines ready including astra Zeneca ( 1.5 billion) USA haven‚Äôt used far, much guys expect Americans give up?give break!Americans also dying always world give give enough.

Looks like actually read article. find enough young patients UK

Yes. requires monitoring financial compensation given. find enough cases study thing name especially UK?

Not controlled manner. matter many cases spreading community, controlled. like enough covid cases

Less 100 new cases completely controlled environment 30 going impact country whole all. rich get better treatment cost poor kids?

Also let's poor get better treatment. costs kids they're trial, adults exclusively. taking part losing anything freedom weeks. don‚Äôt say.  tried looking around sources, found little clarity. see value seeing infectiousness virility vaccinated people (because know vaccines still get sick severe cases, instance), there's lot value seeing detail virus spreads unvaccinated people. Maybe they're both? Maybe one other?

..how confusing. yes, they‚Äôre hard get. im teacher assistant right im get vaccine. got mixed see it, 6 types zoom/virtual ""hangouts"" varying degrees effectiveness:

-¬† **Hangouts people physically far away anyway.**

I mind like people do. I'm going able see friends states/countries reg anyway, nice see faces.

- **Virtual business meetings**

Some suck, ok. personally like ""go"" coordination meeting need mentally present like 5% of, actually get work done time. things like mentoring, networking, conferences, client meetings...some virtual *ok,* lot benefits in-person too.

- **Virtual big life events**

Things like weddings, baby showers, retirement parties, etc. personally **hate** these, lot types events literally meant spent physically together. go know means lot host want supportive, can't wait die.

- **Virtual small life events**

Work happy hour? Virtual game night neighbors? Online salsa lessons partner? fun like 3 months. fun anymore. Also virtual work happy hours suck, everyone's either awkwardly staring silently talking other. 

- **Virtual community events**

Online music festival? Online con? ""Visit Paris without leaving couch""? Nope, substitute. Done too.

- **Virtual school.**

Complete garbage. Unless already meant online school.
Double garbage anyone age 13. You‚Äôve seriously never seen people sub wishing people get sick and/or die? must looking hard -as someone else said it‚Äôs less common used norm sub. Would rather want guy lie you, later take action someone tells truth action all? 
I hope Biden could keep promise, else it‚Äôs gonna real loss American people. reopening - they‚Äôve talked considering reopening hybrid (which dangerous forces multiple cohorts). 

Teachers vaccinated along essential workers (assuming working person). 

As far educators school, Oregon estimates educators offered vaccine gotten two shots end month. Yet child care workers who‚Äôve person kids 11 months prioritized. Actually pharmacist sell one want walk doctor injects good points, really many places Teachers priority high risk people? area. Also bear mind vaccines less effective small number people them. 

That statement given priority, whether Schools open not. also fact thst many places Schools open, hybrid manner. makes social distancing possible, greatly increases safety.

EDIT: don‚Äôt mean republican, I‚Äôm saying work red anti-union states. countries Asia, masks norm covid. Westerners cannot adapt, maybe head extinction like Neanderthals are... I'd curious see source that.

Regardless, much rest Midwest reopened schools *still* seeing curve. Throughout entire country, whether schools open closed, we're massive decline. schools risk? know, right? WFH stay option jobs makes sense. much need job again, anxiety daily commute overwhelming.  Herd immunity feel horrible threshold. 

Once get point everyone wants vaccine opportunity get one build immune response it, largely stop caring. What‚Äôs worse made China? Made India! disagree mean mean that. wrong sub...people want hear anything negative vaccine...just unicorns rainbow farts. Sorry kinds issues going needs highlighted. Lol. Preach! Yeah, still remain fairly convinced initial study unvaccinated initial study also help doctors understand immune system reacts coronavirus identify factors influence virus transmitted, including person infected Covid-19 virus transmits infectious virus particles vaccinated likely immune I'm sure study ""how person infected"" anything, infected.

Anyway. there's one thing exercise really highlighted sometimes matter many sources read, they're working exactly notes end reading things again. infuriating! would tell hate public schools much don‚Äôt 4 hours get rn Yeah man hospitals totally fine!! nurses doctors totally using cloth masks reuse/sterilize single use masks!! So, common well studied effect social isolation? long covid symptoms exactly symptoms isolation. Forcing ppl poverty cutting social safety net, deliberately making housing insecure etc.

Always hear dishonest argument overlooks little choice someone brink destitution has.

But anyone suggests social housing provided instantly hear ‚ÄúBut people won‚Äôt wanna work!!‚Äù

Acknowledging threat destitution used force people taking shitty wages conditions choice. incredibly cynical us lonely introverts live parents basements. found things fill time, course, need life little hobbies baking bread. Yep judging post comment frequency, aggression might coming inside house! good them! priorities take two prongs. One prioritizes mortality, old people high risk dying prioritizes morbidity reducing people getting first place therefore overall spread -- people retail workers, nurses, teachers etc. 

Both prongs make sense attack. help reduce impact pandemic different ways. That's signed petition get Newsome fucking state. Thank take action. we've reached 1.5million signatures thanks small contributions did. welcome. arguing? people like YOU, especially. YOU. NOTHING, tries justify teachers close. successfully convinced continue closures support closures, even say support closing. Shame YOU. cakeday. Remember, takes 2 wipes realize needed 1. Fuck China bot Schools overweight en dangerous go public library get book. Weird right? Nice 100% side. german way Germany observe right absolute cases drop variants including E484K mutations growing exponentially.There calculations renown german epidemiologists calculated likely going third wave march / April even keep recent lockdown measurements variants higher transmissibility immune escape ability.

But yeah future music. saying escape mutations 100% happen screw us realistic possibility considering recent data escape mutations might happen develope kind full resistance present vaccines.

I mean Manaus good example. natural immunity thaaaat different vaccine 76% immune standard variant considering quoted thelancet study. second wave december hit hard expectation. Exactly point, like aerosol real distance cutoff. closed airmass, exposed. 6' rule 100% arbitrary. 6"", 6 miles indeed? settle 6' sounds palatable masses, optimized balance of...anything. people scream SCIENCE this, know 100% full shit based anything meaningful.

You right one thing, society need function. hospitals risk anymore, schools. Open up.

I keep talking. History look upon scorn unfounded hysteria glorified cold. First all, attendance linked performance students, especially disadvantaged backgrounds. Second, disturbingly high proportion students, attending school means get toxic/abusive home environment. gives higher chance trained educators catch signs abuse/neglect etc., act them. good reasons schools focus high attendance. 

That said, wholeheartedly agree sentiment sick kids attend school. That's common sense - yes, lost many schools whose senior management lack themselves. Proper schools tell kids stay ill (not covid, anything mild colds coughs). Proper schools robust policies place e.g. student must attend school least X hours/days episode vomiting/diarrhoea.
And proper schools also caring attitude towards staff, rather promote presenteeism costs. would take full year make improvements ventilation testing? White men certainly back line no?

Subhuman scum. contrary opinion, I‚Äôll mention poor attendance strongly correlates with/is strong early indicator dropping out.

Most likely hypothesis involves partial immunity, i.e. enough true herd immunity, enough people careful gotten may running easy hosts. Could augmented Nov/Dec months many people generally get together Jan month don't. Could seasonality factor understand.

Remember two previous waves rose fell. lot changing factors, including various levels lockdowns people changing behaviors. regardless two peaked fell back virus ran easy hosts awhile one way another, even though time obviously still room grow again. wonder long incubation period another factor this... means time realize control takes long time stop it, get control takes long time fire back up. Anyway, somehow one's getting control again, maybe falling faster time fewer easy hosts third time. Yep blood thinners careful observation current fixes... it‚Äôs correct Truth kids missed day snowed first time literally two years raced put unused too-small snow pants enjoy didn‚Äôt heart call school time. made hot chocolate marshmallows let take snow day. don‚Äôt regret second.

Ok well coward opinions kept yourself. √én US, I'm Europe, yeah.... thing happening. vaccines sale. xbox/ps5 rtx3080 scenario. Florida spring break experiment last year? small room 30 kids x 7 periods day. Damn. That‚Äôs awful. There‚Äôs already studies saying minorities lost 9-12 months education. ok you? want make worse ? That‚Äôs great hear! I‚Äôm really glad fair experience :)

If don‚Äôt mind asking age? agree. studies droplets, aerosols, suspended particles, etc. everyone accepts fact analysis things lab setting somehow translates transmission contagion.

Early found lot Covid RNA found surfaces everyone took mean spread based contaminated surfaces, led frenzy sanitizing every surface. found RNA primarily active, essentially dead RNA particles could infect anyone. forgot hypothesis.

This points matters airborne particles actually infect someone needs studied too. People care ""experts"" say policy decisions driven experts leave worse financial situation before. simple that.

This literally point. reason people can't separate science politics. comment perfectly exemplifies this. quite telling use ""experts"" quotes way. anyways, scientists give analysis results completely devoid politics. Health scientists going say x people going get sick, x people going die, give breakdown epidemiological research know groups affected it. give models. research mechanism provide research regarding contagious deadly is. look social economic ramifications job. That's called guidance. authority policy except use scientific model assist politicians projected outcomes nothing done. 

It's politicians job cost-benefit analysis social economic ramifications. job use data analysis health experts consult economists sociologists understand ramifications psychological, social, economic perspective. job implement enforce policy. 

You using politics, decision politicians, trust scientists, based metric affects *you*. simply make sense. Even reason can't trust experts left worse financial situation. That's science works. analogy:

If go doctor get vaccine. doctor jabs needle arm. jump back, go ""oh god, hurt. feel pain. Therefore, trust giving me"". would nonsense. Science care feelings situation. person's desire better economic future completely irrelevant scientific model. However, get vaccine get back normal less likely get sick die. interpretation hostile doctor causing pain completely unreasonable. really think people sum others' antipathy toward lockdown centered around inability get haircut Frappuccino really revealing place relative privilege whole era lives.

I antipathy restrictive lockdown. provided one example anti-science plagues anti-lockdown crowd make sense. I've gotten haircuts pandemic several times. go work everyday. funny talking privilege, literally said use science completely ignoring economic social ramifications. said fence decide determined circumstance, I'm implying privilege. yes, pro-restrictive lockdown probably working home 4 bedroom house, private gym basement, family social interaction, cable, internet, huge backyard chill in, whatever else makes easy want shut society. point. difficult problem, either direction go, outcomes bad. Blood clots 5 old cardio pulmonary issues 7 old one politicians leader need deserve strong track record providing voice voiceless.

OP history. There's reason despised. that‚Äôs criteria reopening got delayed another year more. yet goal posts move. 

It‚Äôs also following science considering huge amount schools open haven‚Äôt significant contributors spread. ???? school district constantly struggling find applicants positions, years. pay taxes ensure kids teachers vaccinated soon possible? Really, really want next generation adults okay. Eh, hand-wringing gets vaccine moot soon. Even US' current vaccination pace, within month vast majority at-risk people US opportunity get first-shot. true. seems weird everyone needs 1 reason falling cases reality many factors risk.

Also ignores poorer schools classrooms overfilled kids dont really follow directions well. old person health issues, u stay fuck inside till u get vaccine. like retired people work anything could easily avoid contact. Appearntly fuck schools teachers old man Bob cant stay house till gets vaccine. Ideally would enough everyone thats case obviously. false equivalence lol. 

‚ÄúBecause don‚Äôt want continue lockdown year exact people wanted stop two weeks‚Äù

I‚Äôm high schooler/wannabe scientist lol think correct widespread immunity (partial, course) things - except decreased testing. Decreased testing would account fall hospitalizations fallen lockstep cases. positivity rate falling along cases (i.e. 10% long time like 5-6% - meaning cases falling tests falling), suggesting true decline. think decrease testing simply result decrease people experiencing symptoms exposure infected people thus reduced demand testing first place. Yep read article issue issue lot models strategies have. take human behavior account all. behavioralists, anthropologists, psychologists, etc.  


Sure Australia successful. country divided every country pacific ocean half population, that's spread across VAST amounts land. comparing apples oranges. 


I'm doubting expert expert, still one individual narrow expertise. Irish definitely race normal definition term.

Wrong. That‚Äôs plain incorrect.

Irish ethnicity, nationality, culture. race. 

Hence white Irish, Black Irish, etc. Even point Jewish people - white Jews, black Jews, etc. multiple races Jews, multiple races ethnicities. can‚Äôt multiple races of...races. white black people (and no, someone mixed white black ‚Äúblack white person‚Äù ‚Äúwhite black person‚Äù, biracial). Eh really. New cases/day risen fallen various places cases never dropped worldwide like dropping see paper see reported deaths miners, anything retest serum RaTG13/RaBtCoV-4991. That's part concerns me. much know deaths? sort contact tracing died? contact wet markets time infection time death?

I mean 293 coronavirae swabbed sweep, neglecting mention deaths involved pretty critical me.

Think child long impactful entire year was.

Kids learn everyday. sponges can‚Äôt even plan week advance everything new time. Felt like hangover day half mean, given say there‚Äôs new positive cases weekly daughter‚Äôs school, blame teachers quit? common work around?

Depends teacher school think. 

I know teachers won‚Äôt think school day they‚Äôre required back campus. also know teachers set aside couple hours day retool curriculum prepare new course.

Same thing schools - schools 2+ weeks preschool meetings. Others couple days. 

Personally, land middle. enjoy time away. It‚Äôs needed. also try work summer make year easier. Yep reports this. problem places give shots supply shots. feels like everywhere it‚Äôs overwhelming trend. Things getting worse places (Iraq, UAE, Bahrain, Jordan, Peru, Albania name few) little sister failed senior year high school due attendance....**with straight As.** made point make tests, completed course work. punished making take summer school classes, per policy.

We instability issues home.

She professor genetics valedictorian undergrad, full ride masters doctorate based grades etc.

Attendance bs metric learning. Couple things here. 

1. Terrifying seems like bit exaggeration. absolute worst I've seen sub people saying things like ""I splitting headache"" ""I terrible chills nausea"", none lasted longer 48 hours. 



2. almost something akin survivorship bias reading. millions second doses administered, vast majority harsh reactions. like anyone going run social media post ""feeling absolutely normal"" 



I give three real life example people talked two who've completed two dose regimens. 

1. ""achy legs"" low grade fever. Lasted less 24 hours, bad enough prevent cooking dinner family 30 minutes yoga night. 
2. sore shoulder two days, described ""no different flu shot""
3. Absolutely zero side effects



Don't let minority ""bad"" reactions put off!  What's wrong good ventilation lots testing? perspective, teenage kids got non-Covid vaccinations recently fevers flu symptoms 1-2 days. common side effect vaccines. People whining Union's demands unreasonable, cities demands unreasonable met middle. 

The safety regulations put place pretty reasonable, sad union threaten strike get basics. Yes correct, keep business moving. Things don‚Äôt magically appear. I‚Äôm sure agenda article try spin here. Nearly every single country losing doctors nurses this.
It also ‚Äúseems‚Äù never enough vaccines country anyhow. different results based vaccines used, basically vaccines are/will produced US, India, China, Germany, UK South Korea logistics trade routes go there. Eh...California genuine claim called independent nation UK. nation needs able grow food kind trade leverage ensure always food.

I mean disrespect anyone, looking practically based trade dependence following orders nations comes foreign policy, UK kind quasi territory US point. many ways around this. test people appointment. simply show up, test, wait 15 min, continue. Neither slows process throughput still same, adds 15 min wait time individual - slow line down. 2 lines - one screening, one jabbing test antibody negative.

We year plan ahead deal this, one thought implement incredibly obvious step waste doses going arms need them. saying good prisons disease incubators? Correct, think, 50% enough forget lockdown forever. Part population immunity, part young healthy spread virus. Naaah natural way better government making decision ranking groups based priority though. Government officials, front line workers, made decision lives valuable ranked us there. 

Only difference considering chances reelection longterm consequences ranking system. 70 year old politician care 2040. kind person insult people mentally hurt lockdown. comments saying people didn‚Äôt stamina like survive That's common misinterpretation. truth is...

If wanted to, would. Sportsball man science good. ah see. Could maybe send link something use evidence that? might given wife children death sentence. Yes. droids looking for. homework teaches poor work/life balance. Lol people kids getting mad support them.

What universe live kids don‚Äôt need provided for? One thing keep mind part time even 50% percent in-school hours, doesn‚Äôt directly translate 50% good normal school. Also, vaccines necessary school go full virtual form person school-I guess really want vaccines absolutely make sure goes 5 days week afterwards, still. Teachers need held idea vaccination, excuse. Ok mental stamina. Shrug 65 parents still gotten yet, high school went (very affluent school district) already vaccinated teachers. little disgusting imo. SC. Everything including schools wide open here. forget asbestos. whatever, word ""massive' seems dishonest

The drop massive, though, I'm sure dishonest it. 

You mentioned vaccines lot, odd considering article (other brief mention end listing vaccine numbers, attributing drop). think fair say vast majority teachers hate remote learning too

I think fair say. sister teacher loves remote learning. many teachers school. 

There commute, limited discipline issues, kids well remote learning perfect reason shift blame away teacher.

I clarify sister still thinks go back still thinks lot benefits teachers remote work. vaccinations less 2-weeks ago effect yet. rate hospital admissions still falling 25% per 7-days. That's rate years lockdown, since late January.
 
He say restrictions immediately lifted tomorrow, said maybe earlier first planned. Big difference, could learn read. 
 
Are genuinely dense think impossible scientists varying opinions data? fact sometimes disagree means listening experts pointless? Agreed. want kids safe possible means vaccinating teachers. hard decision. hired nanny would want vaccinated well. Vaccines rolled endgame. 

You may find hard believe many people worries life *other* Covid. want shelter place years, grab sourdough bread it. said, someone stated above, rest us TELLING going back living lives come summer whether meets morality standards not. argument there! even COVID arm, vaccine arm! make case finding answer Ebola even easier compared covid, harder.  vaccines? Thank mentioning long-term effects. I'm teacher luckily live country much better rollout vaccinated. One friends long covid, even trouble walking. fact people care essentially disabling us infuriating. someone cut leg like, ""it's ok, least die!"" 1 shot impart immunity. need wait least month half 1st dose full immunity. Im optimistic May, June, July, think push go completely back normal April vaccination rates much higher month two later silly ‚ÄúWe wash produce‚Äù start now? That‚Äôs pretty standard thing general.

Obviously troll line really odd lol think Oxford vaccine (don‚Äôt know sure I‚Äôm trial haven‚Äôt unblinded). 

I felt great rest day - shot noon 1:00 went gym night feeling normal. night woke middle night feeling off. Fell back sleep woke low grade fever morning - 100.3 - body aches, headache next day. Snapped back normal next day. took likely bit 12 hours start feeling something. understand correctly, Jacobson v Massachusetts state absolutely force take vaccine, albeit restrictions. also doubt would based shit storm would create CDC also says lot things need done keep community spread down, like closing bars person dining. picking part say kids go school? saying that, completely idiotic based science whatsoever. based completely unfounded FUD immunity *might* permanent, even though data suggest serious concern, plenty suggest not, including knowledge immunology general. strong unions negotiating Asymptomatic spread incredibly rare, however, pre-symptomatic spread problem since you‚Äôre contagious 48 hours symptoms present. purposes precautions there‚Äôs much difference asymptomatic pre-symptomatic. almost completely better. least compared real low point, bed bound 2 months. I'd say, maybe 70%. last 30% proving really elusive though. seem plateaued might good gets me.

I'm better extent I'm careful pacing, pretty much everything need do. always day. I'm able things like used without planning advance.

I also go ups downs terms symptoms, common kind illness. sadly relapse last week miss 3 days work. happened forgot pace feeling good.

It's easy feel like recovered carefully control much energy use. try go back normal activities, reality slaps face.

I'm working 18 hours week, brain fog comes back can't concentrate.

Not sure feel need justify illness someone clearly really care mean like cancers, Parkinson's, bunch ailments people would pay everything have, cure of? figured yet? remember History teacher high school said let re-take test since absence unexcused. Basically assumed ditched. mom got around excusing YET, struggling working single mom. helps save people harms could considered moral. Everyone knows hope best, plan worst. Let know found anything definitive, found reading words matter many sources found! ‚ÄúYou cannot access domain‚Äù

I guess we‚Äôre supposed take word comes extremely unscientific title scientific article  looked dashboard vs Florida dashboard? They're almost - whole argument whether count non-residents Fl values not. district can't force us get vaccinations.

So would moot point.

Any teacher choose get vaccination. 
  
 
These ones asymptomatic carriers leading infections ^ 
 
  
 
This one concludes mask wearing seem protect mask-wearer. 
  
 
This one says ""Occupation, living apartment versus house, wearing facial mask outside work increased probability COVID-19 infection."" 
  
 
This one seems show cloth masks basically ineffective.  
  
 
This one seems say hand washing face masks effective stopping flu.  Moderna available since Januar 14th, first delivery AZ doses Monday (Feb 8th) associate shot guns. I'll take needle jab. Heh. nice. Cases peaked Thanksgiving Illinois. them? good reason get vaccines arms ASAP. Like said, think borrowed time sitting virus lull understand. get enough people vaccinated able prevent another large spike. anyone lingering pain corona? don‚Äôt know describe exactly, it‚Äôs like stiffness dull pain knees, chest fingers lately started never experienced before. 

When covid, wasn‚Äôt severe tbh, bit shortness breath fatigue. government really needs recognize difficult teachers' jobs increase pay accordingly (and vaccinate working directly students) Downvotes fine. feeling frustrated state things. ever happen you? April, sure - I'm talking fall. pheasant season, pretty typical kids would hunting too. schools still days hunting season even. Like said, definitely plenty kids school activities. markedly different (more open, anything) Wisconsin. they're lot talking meanwhile schools surrounding area already returned form students class teachers even first shot head Fresno County take pay stub might able get shot (I'd make appointment Albertsons). True, would ask medical doctor it, transmissibility vaccination suspected incredibly low anyway, super low risk coming way, going way too. Herd immunity transitory state, destination. Well could prepare job market employers pretty much demand always work, otherwise start looking fire you. know....gotta keep money flowing in, health damned! mean, wouldn‚Äôt exactly near lab takes days start contagious. Patient zero could nearby town city. Everywhere worked manufacturing thing, accompanied cash prize. Short sighted, dumb. cash prize never much time would worth (ofc). much worse cleaning agents? long we're opening schools parents get back work, yeah. completely agree, I'm tired news articls saying ""may, might, possible"" give us actual facts someone's personal opinion mostly likely false. difference vax mask. Masks required. abuse others rights ended. next step vax.

If offered choice flight vax'd slightly inconvenient time, vs better times without masks, would hard pressed redeye arrive 3 hours later, know flight low risk infection. airlines see vote money, want crews safer probably infectious cattle car. Moreover, want dedicated plane.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thanks sharing view. Personally see papers lots talk BioNtech highly effective new variants, suggestions others effective. whilst true pfizer expected perform better variants AZ J&amp;J (measuring kinds disease severe) can't said comparing Moderna. I'm still confused pfizer getting much acceptance 

 pfizer Moderna released similar studies 'prove' effective. 

 put prove quotes case Pfizer, studies used basis expected highly effective SA variant based vitro, engineered partial mutations, whereas data others like Novavax real world hence likely represent realistic portrait.

And studies, sponsored led Pfizer, including partial mutations shown Pfizer works pretty much B117 significantly reduced efficacy SA variant - various independent studies show much pessimistic results SA strain pfizer present. slightly reduced neutralisation B.1.1.7 variant substantial reduction B.1.351 variant. 

Snippet preprint drop studying pfizers effect new find three different variants B.1.351 show significant resistance neutralization vaccinee sera. half samples exhibited potency limit assay. even less neutralized SARS-CoV

^^ put context, theyre saying pfizer vaccine neutralizes SA strain even less OG sars, decade ago..

Another posted conclusion, report neutralization sera slightly reduced largely preserved activity B.1.1.7. contrast, B.1.351 less sensitive even unsensitive large part sera tested, particularly global antibody levels low.

These junk studies, prominent virologists like Florian Kramer Kristian Anderson pointed out

There several papers studies pointing logical conclusion pfizer lose potency E484k need reformulated like others

I see news recently talk EU clause purchase vaccines efficacy appear reduced toward new variants, apparently clause specifically pfizer contract, unsure legally strong is. Obviously b1351 major issue yet, might concern worried 

 heard announcements one day european media pfizer reformulated, another announcement might need to.

Do know latest plan is?

Go Morocco üá≤üá¶ Yeah. observation, reddit elsewhere, people take reasons cases falling (less mobility, holidays etc) even vaccines (way early that) chalk pretty much everything except type preliminary herd immunity? always last possible scenario country like Australia enormous size small population, can't understand government organise building housing solve this?

Because people tend want live cities rather 50+ kms away feel like collusion property developers local governments keep prices artificially high?

More opposite really. systems benefit entrenched landholders developers detriment society. politically popular homeowners restrict built giving handouts property buyers. Negative gearing property investment first home buyer grants pump money market. Thought ACT NSW phasing out, state's levy stamp duty (basically one-time payment property purchased) horrifically inefficient tax discourages people businesses moving want be. Broadening tax unimproved value land ACT NSW much, much efficient encourages land-holders develop, densify make occupied property.

While happening, supply restricted via government regulations. include zoning laws restrict built - i.e. area zoned single-family detached housing, there's going limit many people house area even highly desirable area (you see areas like Nedlands, Crawley Shenton Park Perth lots relatively low-density housing despite relatively close CBD, river, university large park). Local governments political incentives implement onerous regulations provide means existing residents block new development (and even renovations) they're voted residents - people whose lives could benefit moving *into* area.

The result housing prices get pushed up, cities sprawl government build even roads, bridges services cater them. Reserve Bank Australia says $355,000 $870,000 average cost Sydney apartment due zoning local government regulations. UN full predators go third world countries ""help"" pregnating vulnerable girls? Yeah agree, know done point. think post-COVID society change many ways mental health one them.

In end see anything could prevented. Maybe China successfully contained 2019. 

This like natural disaster like famine things like WWI, WWII, vietnam. Stuff happens world unfortunate changes people forever. Better. Still best called business, maybe taiwan foresight cough money months ago like fosun must nervous  Mexico president announced buying vaccine lot people incredibly hesitant mad it, even Lancet paper. Russian scientists best world, honestly deserve better thinking ""the russians bad vaccine must bad!1!1!!"" Still going great. I'd love see data percentage 65+ get vaccine. Deaths hopefully plummet next month. exaggerated speed Congress moves.

I think falls ""political rhetoric,"" national security problem. Slovakia, maybe? ""banned them"" bought FAR, FAR EARLIER EU first receive them. Pfizer Moderna banned exporting vaccines US, banned selling US-purchased vaccines (200 million) countries. 

Both Pfizer Moderna sell vaccines produce long deliver agreed-upon amounts US. chose use plants own/contract due easier distribution storage. gov job last years, maybe wouldn‚Äôt need shot.

Oh boy cultist.

New Zealand, Vietnam countries managed successfully rid country COVID still want vaccinations...you know...to stop exact song dance couple years...    Schools in-person Florida since August aren‚Äôt even DeSantis‚Äô radar. Anyone know anything these? products legit? OCD let tell extremely frustrating seeing people engaging would consider OCD behaviors/thoughts. I've therapy one main goals accept there's uncertainty life can't 100% certain anything.

So see posts reddit news articles saying ""well ackshully, maybe, could be, bad thing might happen vaccine might work new strain"" infuriating. people mental gymnastics justify left house something. Idk frustrating me. would imagine people predisposed developing OCD anxiety disorders already pushed edge this. Experimenting humans best type science. 400M isn‚Äôt much EU behind it. 

As point comparison, BARDA (US government medical fund) gave Moderna 1B front get manufacturing set up. EU even signed contract. 

We also gave 400M Sanofil alone obviously got return investment. üò¢  shit CDC website 100% useless Yes, maybe send child UK than. get great care get great understanding virus. It‚Äôs one Win-Win situations. Hahahaha...Tupac read demands teachers parents had? think outlandish? me, like ""pandemic 25"" Fact: commander forcing Soldiers get COVID-19 Vaccine, unless deploying.

Literally article read
  
‚ÄúWe cannot make mandatory yet,‚Äù Vice Adm. Andrew Lewis, commander Navy‚Äôs 2nd Fleet, said last week. ‚ÄúI tell we‚Äôre probably going make mandatory soon can, like flu vaccine.‚Äù PA tragic funny depending look it. I'm probably immune point went shopping inside supermarket first time since Fall surge. wearing mask bet 50% people inside weren't. hard know immune isn't, suspect mostly people refusing comply anything perceive inconvenience point. I'm guessing gets worse warm weather approaches. that's happening Biden administration made promise reopen schools within 100 days inauguration.  tell toddler authority every aspect infectious disease, authorities holistic view child's health. cost benefit analysis towards children's health, view risks losing education services/development comes bad risks COVID.

Also, epidemiologists support Biontech producing distributing? Since when? UK grow food He's talking enough people vaccinated. that. grew relatively wealthy area w lots stay home parents still made kids go school sick want ""falling behind"". literally ordered death refuse vaccine lmao people realize COVID misinformation prevalent sides spectrum. OBVIOUSLY COVID deniers much dangerous over-protective, ultimately could end over-protective people keep us locked longer need to. Hysteria second worst thing come pandemic behind deaths. 

If people understood goal social distancing/mask wearing prevent overloading hospitals, could much sooner. Instead war people want prove afraid getting virus, healthy people believe anyone viruses touches dead man. There's miseducation around! 

I remember reading Redditor's wife makes leave Amazon packages outside 24 hours insists wiping every single grocery comes house...ironic people believe heavily science misinformed virus actually works. Sure, reality unions power. ""volunteers"" like tribute? hunger games come. I‚Äôm going argue long term effects mRNA vaccines neither us expertise comment anything topic.

Vaccines put selective pressure virus mutations, yes. However, you‚Äôre leaving gives less opportunities viruses mutate first place. That‚Äôs vaccines work(ed) things like measles, small pox, typhoid, tetanus, influenza, multitude diseases either don‚Äôt exist massively declined deadly vaccinated people.

We also know Israel‚Äôs studies vaccine insanely effective keeping people hospitals lessening symptoms. don‚Äôt know vaccine putting selective pressure virus nobody studied yet. major variants happened vaccine also shows children much larger role spreading virus ‚Äúminimal zero‚Äù statement.

In nutshell, yes, natural immunity works well preventing person getting Ming disease *again.* However, goal people getting disease instead ‚Äúlet run course watch millions people die idiots.‚Äù Merkel doesn‚Äôt care contrary dystopian police state everyone wants implement, US military still bound law. [limited] legal understanding commissioned officers cannot forced take vaccine precondition antecedent commissioning. *probably* force enlisted members get it, run massive political issues disparate treatment, viz. officers vs enlisted. Regardless, probably able force officers take psycho. Please stay internet rest us normal people get exposed insanity. opinion mine. gov job last years, maybe wouldn‚Äôt need shot. people teachers. Siemens multinational company business world therefore German company.

LMAO Half country shut weather. decrease today wasnt unexpected Antibodies T-cells attack virus harder, weakening it. Given potential unknown long term side effects seems quite risky ¬£4500 Like commute, deal disruptive students, easier ignore failing students show up. CDC guidelines say class resume person certain precautions taken. districts money allow precautions, guidance useless. Enjoy! Germany fund Biontech vaccine almost 400 million Euros; however, EU members preferred AZ Sanofi. original EU orders were:

- 400 million AstraZeneca

- 300 million Sanofi

- 400 million Janssen

- 100 million Biontech/Pfizer

It's Sanofi failure problems AZ EU ordered Biontech/Pfizer CureVac vaccines.

- 600 million Bionech/Pfizer
- 405 million CureVac dutch national Moroccan descent i‚Äôm proud ashamed. Proud ‚Äúpoor‚Äù third world country managed do. Ashamed way first world country like Netherlands botched vaccine rollout. yet, still don‚Äôt seem hurry.. agree you... 39 yo healthy person infected covid got hospitalized. 

I sadly confirm 9 months cured. facing following complications moment.

- sort lung discomfort sleep back. Doctor started inhaler month see make better

- started getting kidney inflammations. Doctor sure related covid.

- brain fog. symptom mostly snapy. Feels like forgetting really. might need second think next word sometimes (doesn't happen often, happens enough make notice). Found low Vitamin B12. Weird meat eater low B12. Doctor said seems absorbing B12 food moment.

- CEA-ag blood test reading normal indicates sort tumor cancer .. 4 doctors insisted false positive due covid complications chest (go figure) 

will tests next month. suddenly feel something wrong me. good living life normal creeping up. Might coincidence might definitive post-covid complications. huh? Fuuuuuck predicated J&amp;J), correct? Exactly. Masks required much longer (probably end summer places), recommended especially people symptoms vaccinated yet. stop wearing mask 2 things happened:

1. vaccinated.
2. mask mandate lifted. Fact: Army give shit feelings.

Fact: Army protect valuable assets - Soldiers.

Fact: commander forcing Soldiers get COVID-19 Vaccine, unless deploying.

Why? feet would. Still moot point. General doctors pediatricians need understanding disease they're treating.  matter owned US company, Belgium's jurisdiction, cannot please lawless US.

And thats good question, bet regret listening US privatization ""free market"". 

But there's always nationalization, specially humanitarian reasons middle worst pandemic times. :) call corruption understand job. teacher's union number one job serve members, educate society's children.

Hmm.

&amp;#x200B;

1. German EU politicians spend weeks briefing particular vaccine
2. No-one wants vaccine

I sensing kind connection here... ""local producer"" Belgium owned US company. EU-owned local producers? European Commission producing vaccines, Pfizer is. they're using ingredients US (lipids) produce them. extremely pro mask, wear one wherever go. waiting refuse get vaccinated take mask off. point, them. like what? 93 year old gran would want too, doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôd let her.

Someone's gonna shocked read find got removed.

When become culturally accepted treat people raised parents like fucking toddlers?  1.3 million active service members though. Estimates 50-60% getting vaccine horrific. mention vaccine approval grown grown since they've started rolling out. tons family members adamant getting vaccine month ago, they've either gotten one planning get one. Oh thought COVID-19 effect kids, thought want fully open schools? Corruption?  need allow people get enough people existing priority groups want them. Maybe healthcare worker wait month get mRNA jab someone going get vaccine June/July would jump opportunity dick goes limp hair falls out. sure getting old mate? Unless aren‚Äôt willing take themselves. plenty players/celebrities etc gladly take encourage others same. Let make public statements it. I‚Äôm anti-vax means I‚Äôll lot respect players aren‚Äôt sure stay rather making insincere, bullshit statements they‚Äôre pressured so. opinion, groups would ‚Äúdoing right thing‚Äù Lie Wut? also sick food service workers unable take time infect tons others.

Better sick time policies would huge boost economy. maybe panic keeping things control  what? Schools never open ever again? really understand fuck happened people. can't life figure out. really easy brainwash people fear, even data statistics everyone see? I've lost faith humanity. Outdoor bars completely safe (as long they're ""sit down"" bars clubs). everyone spread outside, transmission basically exist. someone turned 21 last July though, cannot fucking wait go damn club. Gotta support narrative ... totally unlikely they're using comment farm help bolster criticism. Wow dumb! really bad side effects shot coworker still reaction nearly 2 weeks would get again. worried flu like symptoms day, just, can‚Äôt. Every day, try cardio workout.

First, reflect fortunate healthy lungs. push hard knowing every workout makes much resilient.

Keep pushing. Every day reduce risk. think illustrate simply case 'AZ use 2P hence that's good' - reality likely complicated.

It could AZ payload DNA, vs RNA Pfizer Moderna, explains difference. Again, know. That‚Äôs awesome! :) crazy thing Israel can‚Äôt contain cases unless Palestinians get vaccines. explanation spite. third coworkers didn‚Äôt want period didn‚Äôt get it. think 2 3 fence people got found job taking away covid leave. rest us knew wanted got it. think gonna end no, pretty effective first time around. Plus vaccine would even faster reduce number daily cases. kind event could allow virus coupled infectious virus resistant virus. thought exact wording anyone wants appointment get one April. Appointments backlogged, getting appointment April doesn‚Äôt equal getting shot April even May matter. It‚Äôs sort semantics, hope I‚Äôm pessimistic wrong though. There‚Äôs one case - it‚Äôs great sample size. ""This even final form!"" Right! used Zoom work required stuff flat refuse use friends family. Would 10/10 rather talk phone see person. expert, someone would called alarmist pandemic. I've asked 20 people got it. far. Happened right dose pretty sure me. seems nowhere ask around this. What?! got part we'll anti-maskers they've already covid, lost everywhere else. Straight up. you‚Äôre good anyone dead either, it‚Äôs getting point there‚Äôs severe issues locking seeing people, time make changes! hopeful news indeed!

I guess also work well Brazilian variant? guy, still wiping stuff down? would like stop it‚Äôs habit point probably illusion safety anything still. Better states severe restrictions, ironically. mean hang family friends, take precautions want to. mental health important physical health. Covebolaids! Yes, I‚Äôm well aware tasty cheap natural options people would consider eating day ‚Äúbland‚Äù. Haven‚Äôt heard side effect. wonder common rare is. I'd disagree. eat high fat delicious fuck. I've eaten least 5 egg yolks day past 2 years blood numbers great. article treasure trove useful information.

I hope many countries learn experiences Australia.

It would prudent start building dedicated quarantine centers near airports border crossings world.

We vaccinating possible variant show vaccines work. 

Also another pandemic eventually.

As article describes, proper, separate ventilation needed workers facilities need protected well also need avoid contacts outside facility much possible.

Ideally workers stay facility themselves. (and compensated royally risk taking isolation)

If approach problem scientifically systematically, overcome virus! Real question: keeping phone charged? mean least number deaths still stable. right wrong. Cases keep popping up. That's right. one required short lockdown every one (3 4) since August last year controlled without restriction. live outside Auckland almost restriction normal life since April last year live Auckland extra 20 days period. may agree restrictions government's response deal one way another every single day year. would put edge trying plan life. least freezing foreign aid follow international law!

Remember weeks ago blaming Palestinians ordering vaccine, this! know live perhaps helps know that, broadly speaking, likely can't get lot worse dealing with. goes without saying main reason governments opted lockdowns prevent ICUs flooded - risk decreasing rapidly. small percentage at-risk individuals 'responsible' severe (e.g., ICU admission) cases. are, usually, first get vaccines. people can't get sick anymore fundamental reasoning lockdowns cease exist. question whether governments willing release pressure, global situation theoretically get better. It‚Äôs better thought would point. guess bar set much lower. best part they‚Äôre saying people following restrictions don‚Äôt mental stamina do. like parody version dOoMereS every arms export Israel debated parliament? I'm 28 remember visiting old people remote 19 cases - ah - Canada life party ... non-story

&amp;#x200B;

several people work also member CCP, surprise; second largest political party entire world. potential issue limitations hardware raw materials vaccine. Ie make factories produce az one could limited availability machine/raw resources effectively useless. Alongside there's potential one multiple vaccines rendered less effective others due mutations, we've seen AZ vaccine SA variant potentially. hedge bets multiple vaccines better chance avoiding limiting factors precursor supplies, ensuring wider spread pharocokinetics act upon vaccine. 1. China regular basis.
2. Slovakia achieved -70% days caused two rounds mass testing: always dilute like end January, first round executed well.

Regular mass testing must mandatory work places schools, frequency depends local prevalence. Anyone skipping pays tracing quarantine compensation. Liability wavers people breaking law must stop: Medical repercussions aside, society let people actively break major laws let get away without paying cleanup, time enforcing pettiest things damage caused jail time. causes unrest.

The real obstacle politicians need secure enough tests manufacturers able carry out. Dont many high hopes that, virii might mutate less deadly silent time, could happening now. However living country B.117 atm ramps entirely convinced. Maybe old variants going down. Florida ca mid march til april interesting, see basic immunity B.117 well. He's uk silly twat used normal couple generations ago news. *Illegal border crossings Mexico major even minor vector infection*

They would be, US tried ""Zero COVID"" policy. would NZ magically transported border Mexico? 

*but things NZ sucessfully US didnt include early action, strict measures, clear communication working together towards common goal*

Even US that, would still constantly suffer illegal border crossings bringing COVID. That's news.

I think investigators linked institutions. r/coronavirusuk much better. Ffs cases rising country It‚Äôs actually pretty cheap eat healthy, it‚Äôs also pretty bland unless good cook. Usda recommends way many carbs. 330 lbs, 200. experience say yes, carbs problem. So, cases dropping extreme extent can't help feel sense optimism. never seen [this large entire pandemic. alleged third/fourth/horrific/variant/UK/Brazil/RSA wave is, well, really happening global scale.

With vaccine rollout underway we're going see whole lot less serious cases. Soon, high-risk cases (in Western world, least), protected. vaccines can't explain decline cases. wildly under-reported media we're incredibly well. vaccines able protect vulnerable individuals gargantuan drop infection rates, situation could improve much sooner seem think. let's hope rationality take fearmongering, defeatist attitudes tone bit roll back normal state affairs. think? countries completly fucked response get bailed first?

Looks like even cherry picking. people still grocery delivery also think ending 2022. I'm glad place popular. That's cause guys get ( yes I'm salty ) Meh, made 2 questionable statements:

1 ""there clear evidence human human transmission""
Which may true point amended weeks later. confused many people.

2 ""medical masks must prioritized health workers. healthy, need wear mask, unless taking care person suspected COVID-19 infection."" 
Which done address shortage masks early 2020. personal opinion encouraged people make masks even wear scarf helps little.

Trump may called statement blatant lies, long believed best always believe exact opposite Trump said.


The alarmist ebola hit years back. got lot flak alarmist ebola turned less contagious feared.

When covid-19 hit, seemed control Wuhan lockdown. think bit overly cautious believed countries would imitate China also hard lockdowns (as recommended).

After all, China ranked way lower pandemic response capabilities compared US UK 2019 shortage warnings counter virus, especially February March still possible contain There's still evidence natural origin would premature assume that.

Exactly! long prescribing hydroxy whatver injecting disinfectants hoping covid goes away ""April""   better had. entitlement whatever want. vaccine save lives reducing severe symptoms greatly. still get get vaccinated, still spread it.

It surprise plurality, majority? Eh. Bars Restaurants obviously large spreaders. Spread within family (IE Husband Wife) going another large spreader. Workplace spread another big one.

There's much stuff imagine small private gatherings would able break majority.

But, yes, believe city, small home private gatherings much lower rates due snow cold. Lol!!! Thanks, too, brutal.

No RCTs causal evidence. 
 evidence here: ~3700 longhaulers, nearly even distribution among age categories. Also contigent severe disease pre-existing conditions. depicted people workout. hate fit people

No stereotyped gyms refusing close CA first stay home order FrEeDuMbs. reading way much comment dude. okay... someone love odd sized balls. Experts hu? Hahahaha yep good old corrupt Biden keeping promises! One day humans forced think happens ""normal"" prevail ignorance supercede common sense!! ppls kids fu""(ING swear!

This unexpected. would politically completely untenable Biden get rid order, always obvious would case. Covid-21! Oh that‚Äôd torture!  problem large chunk population starts falling priority bins, Elderly, Risk ( Cancer, Diabetic, Asthma , Hypertension, ETC ) essential workers hit good 80% adult population.. risk takes 45%, essential workers 25% adult population ( 50m / 200m ) elderly ( 60 ) another 25%.. Basically impossible mess sort through.  thing here, teachers go school assign shittons work classroom alone. stay home. bullshit. Glad there's starting bit sense higher ups. Kids zoom year school year almost done, vaccine finish it‚Äôs started. pandemic isn‚Äôt clear yet still thousands cases per day. Going back school dumb move lol. Planning fall semester sounds much reasonable teachers majority country vaccinated worry kids going spread sure you‚Äôre downvoted. way. Teachers think world revolves around them, least ones I‚Äôve interacted outside student/teacher setting. several would understand. Also lot places teachers back teaching want person. BioNTech signed deal Chinese firm Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd exclusively develop commercialize COVID-19 vaccine products developed using BioNTech‚Äôs mRNA technology mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau Taiwan. Cases spike little bit March April, people get vaccinated cases, hospitalizations, deaths go down. combine people outside due warmer weather. governors removing mask mandates... half people thinking covid solved never problem.... strong hand side much beyond congress, exec orders get shot supreme court. Except Oxford/AZ vaccine far less effective 40% SA variant. Maybe 10% lucky mean, remember time wiped everything wouldn‚Äôt order out, like March April 2020. remember used take like 45 minutes grocery shopping sanitize everything. don‚Äôt think twice throwing fridge. 

I‚Äôm stil vigilant lot ways, winter helped keep inside usual but... second temp goes I‚Äôm outta here, thinking twice. mom vaccinated, hopefully soon too, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm concerned about. that's thing I'm JUSTIFYING anything. I'm saying one size fits solution say ""eat less exercise more"" needs conversation sometimes can't look someone think ""oh look fat lazy person eats McDonald's"" 

In college nearly killed trying lose 40 lbs gained... got birth control BOOM. Weight gain gone. zero prior conditions low BMI prior that. point vaccinations start kick drive cases even further. seems many anti-restriction anti-mask groups care come across cold, I'd figured least they'd every incentive conduct provide analyses. able. Hope feel better soon. Colonial power? India? guy jokes. went local USPS office yesterday horrific. PPE, plastic window coverings, people crowded buildings. family friend USPS worker caught COVID work hospitalized 1.5 months, still long way full recovery. Theyre little protect workers disgrace. Let make crystal clear:

Once risks kids, zero need wait kids vaccinated. Kids higher risk things like flu, car accidents, happenings, yet don‚Äôt make live bubble. risk isn‚Äôt kids. It‚Äôs tiny number kids‚Äîmostly preexisting vulnerabilities‚Äîthat affected it, worth mitigation efforts doing. 

Children. Should. Go. To. School. Without. A. Vaccine. Period. (Actually several periods haha) ‚Äîonce adults vaccinated

We open schools without vaccine kids disease known affect kids much less potential significant illness children five year old playing dirt washing hands properly‚Äîwhich happens don‚Äôt send home zoom class. Outside initial e-mail, we've heard Megasite either. appointment 6th. think it‚Äôs combo misled people genuinely afraid certain posters trying make point Vaccines must get useless variants. last 10 days reporting US. DDG'd covid school news. 

This end tears, probably already has. place locked tight. Every single state people gathering throughout November December homes, regardless restrictions business place. genetically tested see you‚Äôre prone cytokine storm not?

Because unless have, don‚Äôt know Covid risk you. People young died suffering long term effects due catching it.

Yes, people choose. fully informed facts. There‚Äôs telling novel virus affect you, get it. Can‚Äôt go thinking there‚Äôs risk, that‚Äôs true. go! one thing offer couple months rent desperate people need pay bills, another thing offer cover consequences something goes wrong. China, Vietnam, Thailand, right cue. Ah, think misunderstood point, mean Congo never restricted way finding origins virus; never like ""ooh no! look there! look long, go check little museum courageous doctors nurses since start crisis?"" still compare behaviors China Congo manner. ""same curve"" anything says gets weaponized.... prez sure. vice-prez... sorts. Thanks update, longer VA sent link several loved ones, Fairfax Co. tech savvy enough follow prompts/follow ups though go back register county. 

Absurd statewide system means *except largest county state don‚Äôt really know point math there. we‚Äôre giving 1.5M doses day June given 190M-220M doses vaccine. ( 12 days left February counting today multiplied 1.5M 18M. 1.5 times 30 days month 45M. 45 times 3 months ( March / April / May) 135M plus 18M remainder February 153M. Add already 55M doses given 208M.) assuming speed doesn‚Äôt increase all. June 208M doses HOPEFULLY given out. already data saying 1 shot Pfizer offers sort protection. You‚Äôre also forgetting people still going getting natural immunity date June 1st, forgetting point vaccine immunity protect haven‚Äôt already gotten virus. shitty gyms full roided dudes

This depicted people workout. hate fit people. admit it. Maybe everyone shitty YouTube workouts home. Fuck anybody finds mental health benefits, addition physical ones, actually lifting weights. Hope become depressed, right? Also fuck gym owners. Hope go business can't feed families, right? hobby relate to, therefore must inferior you, right?

Can find even one single instance COVID outbreak gym? can‚Äôt think last time within 6 feet someone grocery store 15+ minutes, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs same. Brief fleeting contact isn‚Äôt considered risk CDC. States need enforcing mask mandates, though. ""Enough population immunity cause virus slow down"" herd immunity. Herd immunity enough population immunity essentially completely halts spread virus. big difference slowing down.

For example, say threshold immunity 60% population immunity. hit 40% spread slow fewer people left infect. hit 50% slow even more. hit 55% slow even more, stop spreading yet. 50% still hit herd immunity. people money days. though? schools mostly closed whole time, like teaching students killed them. imagine murdered investigate killer unlikely. wish anyone particular harm hope that's go want clarify something: even vaccines totally effective getting disease, key vaccine candidates reduce severe covid cases (which lead hospitalizations deaths) HUGE amount (for instance, Johnson Johnson reduces 85%, Moderna Pfizer reduce 100%). whole reason we've locking wearing masks want slow spread hospitals overrun covid cases. Even can't completely stop spread covid, reduce severity to, say, common cold, that's huge victory lead us back normal. Got it, first thought meant even around child. look 7-day average see increase. extreme weather fewer normal got tested. might encourage apply, encourage participation.

Also amount job losses caused pandemic, usual black/white comparison rich/poor every place winter storm.   good enough USA good enough EU. live it‚Äôs pretty broken. sure mean. Lolololol fuck them. promised vaccines twice, meetings setup times cancelled. whole thing mess getting loud aggressive cake day? want answers, contact state leadership local school district, decisions made, dude reddit. Agreed!  Yeah, safe Covid can't really go together. Nah I‚Äôm extrovert lot friends miss enjoy physically active things. Far lazy boring. someone satisfied binging Netflix playing video games. I‚Äôve learned many new hobbies taken advantage time, fulfilling spending time people. Also family lives side world haven‚Äôt seen year.. yeah, depressing. restrictions. Absolutely. 

Is government CA going do? Absolutely not. going √ºber-cautious everything fucking pulse vaccinated, even I'm sanguine it. Idk completely isolated basically worst part  IFR covid children 10 less IFR flu. 

Are parents previously worn required mask around children flu season heartless sociopaths? are, heartless sociopath. We‚Äôre late party usual. r/holdmyspikeprotein Well hope long term vaccines work hoped. 

But correct, working staying facility would miserable existence. also mundane work combined constant danger infected infecting others.

Ideally let people job longer month. 

I doubt government actually pay 6 figures cleaners people bringing food. Maybe administering tests?

If building dedicated facility, could automation built in. Maybe system conveyer belts tubes deliver food supplies? cleaning corridors, maybe robots used building layout kept simple?

Nobody asked assure working hard


Nobody says care, I'm essential worker able vaccinated month ago, work harder anyone, guess I'm EXPOSED enough get return without vaccinated


No nobody says vaccinate them, we're saying vaccinate fucking need vaccinated asap


We fucking KNOW, want open get vaccinated, WHAT? That's I'm asking, OPEN VACCINATION YES FUCKING DEMANDS?! Yeah, that's bullshit narrative. Yes, kills old people often kills middle aged people, still kills lot middle-aged people cripples many more. even kills children. Comparatively rarely, happens. wearing masks, getting vaccines presented opportunity, expecting people continue giving freedom indefinitely risk substantially lowered vaccine mutations rendered vaccines less effective realistic.

Everyone cost benefit analysis head. global pandemic Ebola similar disease kills half people infects causes massive internal bleeding, I'm sure even American public would less unanimously say ""we need shut everything, lock doors, arrest anyone public, pandemic wiped out.""

COVID-19 obviously deadly, though still deadly some, symptoms people look like flu, gray area. all, flu kills people, we've shown staying home prevents flu outbreaks, we're going mandatory wfh orders quarantines every flu season. say every life priceless, level death we're willing accept sake carrying functioning society. way we've accepted cars indispensable part life we're willing accept casualties auto accidents. insane. already know roughly effective vaccines even enough information ways without intentionally infecting people. need potentially screw people's health future?

Instead, I've felt physically great day! I'm 100% sure psychosomatic. feels like gentle exercise buzz.

Has anyone else feeling? kids considered asymptomatic still issues.. health problems previously looked Illinois death numbers today looks like deaths among 80-100+ population fallen dramatically. still deaths among 60-79 age range outliers 20s/30s/40s/50s hopefully become less common age group gets fully vaccinated. holding highest standard. last guy sucked mean ""slightly better"" acceptable. still fail recognize vaccinated teachers incentive return classroom. ü§¶

Do want kids back school what? unreasonable assumption make?

It‚Äôs almost certain poor people ones sign this. like majority people sign military poor. longer smell BO

This thing notice difference smell months later

I go much deodorant safe lmao    granddaughter recently struggling POTS symptoms. It‚Äôs certain covid point certainly possible since school friends/teachers/classmates sick different times. did, asymptomatic never tested it. say reopen, mean hybrid, full? county largest School system state go hybrid, also many students special needs School 4-5 days week. switch back virtual 4 weeks many staff got qaurantined. ones affected ones working special needs students School even others virtual. Teachers affected, also bus drivers support staff. 

They literally enough staff open foors, lack desire Teachers, many staff qaurantined.

Your kids Teacher may vaccinated, others School? got first moderna shot past Saturday, today (Wed) noticed slight rash around area got shot, arm still slightly sore.

Should concerned?  matter, vaccines noticeable effect EU next autumn anyway shitshow going on. No, Dems always give preferential treatment like this... supposed sort zinger? Many people say normality summer worried strict capacity limits considered normal eyes U.S governors... However would quite hard study vaccines there's vaccines available. deserve exact access every worker you‚Äôre working school. grocery logistics daycare workers get vaccinated, you. Or, you‚Äôre immune compromised, near retirement age, prioritized categories. teachers prioritized in-person worker. 

And state (OR) teachers vaccinated, school plan school, formal informal child care workers who‚Äôve caring kids prioritized. mean metaphorically. kids's parents, entire older generation protected closing schools. [The alternative vote could Kick head. They‚Äôre living rent-free. Oh yes. pedestal. Ones built pocket money. Papier-m√¢ch√© wonders. That‚Äôs like asking nursing homes become infected. evidence I‚Äôve seen back contact tracing study New York determined 70% cases studied originated households including small gatherings. 

However, it‚Äôs clear combined small gatherings household spread, since catching family member household catching house party went obviously much different. Also 70% cases person able willing identify source spread, like 20% cases, course you‚Äôre much likely able identify caught someone inside household outside it. two summer months, least Germany nearly bad winter. really understand difference situation teachers aren‚Äôt going work? Hahaha, that‚Äôs fair spread Latin America? make sound like disease. possible confused explicitly removed ability sue employing company ( like partner's employer) company damages cause behavior pandemic. live GA, could done state level.

However, condescending response, would bet understand idea behind said same. Government allowing entities sue damages caused me. going allow sue damages caused me. Feel free provide actual information insight. willing learn. NY- mom, step dad, dad appts rcv first dose vaccine month. age 65 comorbidities. Point is- going drastically different spot 2 months chip away risk. issue is- NY requiring doctor's note prove comorbidities, going people take advantage system arent technically eligible yet. Could get paid applying one these? wife gets vaccine Monday I‚Äôve already healthcare. get I‚Äôm going go back normal. course mandatory masking locations I‚Äôll follow regulations  get you‚Äôre saying. someone says ‚Äúalmost 20%‚Äù they‚Äôre clearly throwing numbers don‚Äôt math nazi. basis entire post saying it‚Äôs starting look better. cool percent entire post pretty much opinion begin accurate one. vaccinate 80 year olds first doesn‚Äôt happen COVID came along, think ever met anyone could even name different brands vaccines. That's doctors for. probably could pushed September, would reasonable thing do. common healthy 60 population.

2/3rds us overweight. 

Furthremore, look survey covid hospitalizations conducted CDC. half hospitalizations [people likely go hospital catch elderly person, there's lot spread among younger people. don‚Äôt work back original assertion rather assume disagreeing you?

Regardless, politics perception vaccinating teachers get back classrooms. Don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs controversial you. Don‚Äôt worry everyone, schools magical ventilation systems. They‚Äôre old decrepit build filth decay makes uninhabitable virus. ask Emily Oster! Hey, least actual volunteers time prisoners, minority communities, whole towns idea happening. 

Progress? Yeah meningitis actually dangerous kids. Covid isnt. 

The names ‚ÄúDenny crane.‚Äù no, claim ‚Äúirony‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs non sequitur.

And next time quote comment, include double pun. genius alternative? Yes Winter games February.

So Summer Olympic Games June/July, would sandwiched two big events. IOC probably want that.

Imo would make sense push September year. way, Japan would lot time vaccinate population. logical conclusion simply re-open everything, longer worried 65+ deaths, death rate small worth taking measures for. I'm denying get useful information animal testing, case see viral loads animals relevant humans. I'm asking good faith here. Maybe original statement overzealous responding completely inane comment. Denmark, Germany Sweden pretty decent (and rising exponentially) vaccination rates. US double vac rate Denmark.

To say aren‚Äôt vaccinating untrue. maybe instead people yelling antimaskers, screaming people can't put fork get couch. Every measure made states combat Covid half assed best. This. needs made clearer general public whole lot face face entire year. You‚Äôre probably great risk driving clinic get infected Covid infection. degree many young people (obviously yourself) overestimate risk Covid crazy. I'm dumb ass working cancer center along. Guess what? Mask screening work really well. covid rate plummeting. Time what's right kids get back school. seems unethical due possible permanent symptoms (long haulers) think answer pretty clear. teachers hold leverage returning in-person teaching advance vaccinated. may working classroom, assure working hard ever. return in-person teaching without vaccinated, run risk exposed quarantined, result school closure, happened district. order stabilize system required in-person teaching, teachers need given opportunity vaccination soon possible. quote says ""suggesting possible link"". 

From first article: emphasized could establish causality COVID-19 type 1 diabetes. 

From second article: study based handful children active coronavirus previously exposed virus.

I think decided make something nowhere. think reaching conclusion without reading articles carefully. Clickbait headlines often lead that. I've waiting happen since May. time make workplaces safe instead security theater going since pandemic started. way open safely actually able keep things open everyone gets vaccinated. Meanwhile Indiana, we‚Äôve face face since August governor prioritizing us say we‚Äôll get general public. I‚Äôm replying saying models showed drop, isn‚Äôt necessarily true. drop occurring anecdotal experience, think ""rule follower"" moral superiority thing wane. wear mask outside walk around Chicago, used one that. see people walking maskless outside usual days.

That's one thing, course. supports general feeling neck woods. pretty much brave, sense resolve, afraid go grain live life way feel best you. people follow. grandpa probably 350, chain smoker, lived till 80. people get lucky one else finds inhumane use children lab rats? Thats UK you. important comment here--peehaps could repost first level? People, least ones know, paying attention this. unfortunately MSM people thinking (at least UK) 100,000 cases means 100,000 critically ill people could wipe entire households time curve started down, even vaccinated 5% population. Nevermind wait 2 weeks see vaccines full effect. rounded 61%. That's small. whatever dude lol.  schools closed Christmas reopened since. true apply every jurisdiction, overal totals US Europe look way, least based NYT graphs US accepting lockdown refugees Canada?

.... SUPPOSED be? accepting new tech following scientific evidence good thing? mock people followed data data led? uncontrolled observational studies limited small sample size.‚Äù

You mean enough hair? read many idiotic posts Reddit. one idiotic all. Good points, sounds like perhaps involvement since say ""we tested"".  true?   
But year bombarded ""follow science, gold standard double blind testing, etc"" treatments preventative measures dismissed anecdotal even appeared successful clinical settings. know, I‚Äôm trying keep things simple you. 
Why think coronaviruses rhinoviruses cause common cold induce herd immunity die out? No. I'm saying chances even catching someone high temperature unlikely 1. get rid fever ibuprofen 2. consumer forehead thermometers accurate all. read low. person actually slight fever might read 98-99 still considered normal. always read around 96.5-97 forehead thermometers.

Also, many Covid patients never fever.

tl;dr: whole routine going thru temperature check going catch small % Covid patients enter room. 

It's security theater designed make people feel better. media forgot criticize/fact check statement politician 280 characters spread states countries. search research. average person, research means asking experts reading opinions variety experts educate yourself. ""blindly listening"" making sure source information high quality. make sense you?

I say I'm scientist extremely easy misinterpret primary literature fail contextualize properly knowledgeable methodology greater body work. example, non-negligible amount weak science there, might put undue credence without trained eye. think best current estimates 30% people US infected. 12-13% people vaccinated making noticeable contribution now, too. But, decline cases, etc., started percent vaccinated lot lower. schools get funding based attendance, Superintendents motivated money. not? Every single damn time even bother say one smidge criticism anything CCP China related thread pre-emptively decided single smidge criticism instant banishment hell, I've always *always* gotten comments saying ""but look USA!"" ""China nothing wrong, dare you!!""

So I'm writing later. odd phenomenon. threads become weirdly hostile anyone want shower praise China - they're clearly fuckin angelic, lot shady shit goes there. bots know. mask put minute. Losing weight take *years*. unless know fountain youth located can‚Äôt really stop people aging. 

Antimaskers absolutely causing spread. Well yeah. That's believe anyway. human morals subjective. Constructions human mind. right wrong world. Persuading individual something may ""wrong"" ""bad"" due moral stance feels authoritarian me. individual may free decide themselves. Whether agree matter. 

It's meaningless whatever. peace freedom kind thinking. Dumb thing is, last full time job going independant contractor, got 3 sick days year. use sick days, lost em. never used probably gave back 8 10 sick days time period. teachers priority shouldnt police officers too? social care workers, supermarket workers, bank employees? teachers prioritised completely unfair. Man weird time alive. years virtual schools huge component corporate attempts demonize public education order pilfer tax dollars. they're worst thing history. I'm sure ignorant background funny context obvious victim propaganda. said Manaus Brazil - 75% people got yet recent outbreak worst yet massive dying.

Numbers dropping major holiday season behind us. People stopped gathering families travel falling back typical rates. doesn‚Äôt mean anything virus itself.

Having said that, still want make clear every nation's moral duty closely monitor spread country actually put forward ideas + cooperate recommendations mitigate spread. get special treatment immediate service, discriminated taken seriously.

Chicago teachers refused go back school. live several also quit. kids school automated phone system calls us messages several times week new positive cases school. looks like daughter going entire school year home, distance learning. feeling okay? sure pre-emptive rant whataboutism there.

For record though think whataboutism stupid logical fallacy basically means country something bad first, they're somehow immune future criticism someone else bad thing Duh, hasn‚Äôt subsequent nationwide super spreader event everyone visiting family holidays time. peak couldn‚Äôt last forever. 

Don‚Äôt let subsiding holiday peak lull complacency. simply set new threshold consider really, really bad. likely see another peak result super bowl. don‚Äôt foresee another huge super spreader event horizon. many people travel Easter holidays.

It confirmed someone South Africans variant twice (two negative tests 4 month span) we‚Äôve also received confirmation virus recombination. isn‚Äôt bad... yet... caution remember everyone insisting UK variant wasn‚Äôt bad disproven confirmed higher mortality morbidity rates (I believe 30% 70%, respectively). absolutely saying people criticized actions. course should. stupid shit outfits, voice, laughs, insignificant shit, maybe think important is. WTF wrong you? want people focus ideas actions, superficial shit.

I kind thought white men started (barely) notice unequal media coverage attitudes towards different races, would also notice nexuses inequality coverage attitudes.

Sweden went herd immunity right? lockdown mask? mutation still isn‚Äôt reason Brazil second wave Manaus still never 76% infection Thank you! thing live UK. really, really fortunate centralised healthcare, huge amount strain, works bureaucratically, way knowing alternative available me, already vaccinated, that's central record follows everywhere go. close friends USA vaccine program sounds almost like survival fittest states -- like manage book, yours. much regimented here.

I hoping issue one way another, yet another unknown top unknowns already dealing with. Every county thing. county allowing anyone anywhere equal access vaccine appointments long fit current category. result, lot visitors Texas getting vaccinated here, puts additional pressure doses.

Neighboring counties require either permanent residency work county get vaccine.

I think part problem getting Moderna back January. Yesterday's presser, Moderna said packaging issue stopped shipping ""several weeks"", expected fix issue ""soon"". reported caused backlog 32.2 million doses waiting test / packaging / shipping steps. able fix whatever shipping issue is, may see additional vaccine.

Also, state's allocation model give vaccines major hospital chains. Centura getting allocation using city, sending almost vaccine rural hospitals. also said last administration let say idk teachers person 5 days week, full days, special needs children cannot distance wear masks... Uhhhh...yeah...not really 'bullshit"" put it. options always go back work starve die? enough resources take care families need it. pandemic isn‚Äôt going forever. seems escape mutation around now: that‚Äôs case, even though partially escapes antibody responses, cases still plummeting worldwide. would prudent observe situation, think utmost priority vaccinating many people possible, also limit number mutations happen (if one transmits virus, mutations can‚Äôt occur). 

Also, didn‚Äôt assert this, it‚Äôs worth note don‚Äôt think informing public policy, lockdowns, restrictions variants chance make cases rise. Much world approaching year type lockdowns, isn‚Äôt sustainable. truth overrated opinion. time it‚Äôs best know. they're getting funding it, there's really downside companies research. Either COVID completely goes away never produce new vaccines continues mutate need boosters voila, new ongoing revenue stream. fact they're making rules tells us nothing whether continuing issue. better question, **not** make rules something **might** happen. There's downside prepared. western press treating safe, effective cheap vaccine save millions lives like bad disease prevents purely due country origin, soon start calling racists yet?

In seriousness know 15 people doses Pfizer worst I've heard headache fatigue went away day two. Small sample people personal experience, know, thats experience far. Great! also stop sitting around acting like youre ‚Äúfollowing science‚Äù you‚Äôre actively denying data.

CDC says open schools. wants schools open. Polls say majority want schools open. people don‚Äôt seem union workers don‚Äôt mind scaring entire generation. No, royal lol. background data collection analysis, statistics, biomechanics research, anything ""medical"" specific research.

There's big difference relying previous knowledge make inferences new similar situations, relying anecdotes. Especially previous knowledge tells us anecdotal evidence treatments incredibly unreliable. ""Follow science"" mean we're complete vacuum gold standard double blind trials done every aspect knowledge. always balancing act potential benefit/potential harm, likely thing based previously available knowledge, etc. 

We say wear mask randomized control trials showing masks prevent transmission covid-19. relied available knowledge make reasonable conclusions. knew masking least somewhat effective preventing transmission respiratory diseases, potential benefit high, potential harm negligible non-existent, recommended it. know dozens potential treatments thrown patients, anecdotally appear work pure chance. especially mechanism we'd expect treatment work, anecdotal evidence things like HCQ viewed HIGH skepticism. need wait randomized control trials treat patients corticosteroids position patients ventilators differently. Using corticosteroid (an anti-inflammatory) treat inflammatory disease follows existing knowledge protocol. Repositioning patients fit high benefit/low harm scenario.

In scenario, people testing saying recommend going outside protocol tested. can't say sure work. Changing protocol involve risk. US CDC said alter protocol. UK made another decision, based knowledge available, cognizant risks entails (with understanding risks informed things know immunity general vaccines we've studied past). They're calculating benefit acting without complete knowledge outweigh risks. lot people criticizing it. Meanwhile people criticizing US' approach holding reserve second doses people who've received first dose avoid even possibility second dose delayed. We're fast moving situation incredible real world consequences, less perfect knowledge. We'd love randomized control trials things want know about, rely know. I'm glad I'm one make calls. I've completely isolated years. business usual except I'm kind sick get talk scientists? Sign fuck up.

They literally give examples Nunavut. think would delighted go back conceived normal life, longer exists. go back really normal anymore different experiences.

Something happened January 20th, meaning people longer feel need spread fear.

Vaccines rolling out, people seeing finish line.

We're coming one year think that's really hitting people. People cool giving 10 months life, year different ring it. Easier solution would people confirmed positive self report accept single dose. mention there's kinds unknown risk type recommendation since there's studies vaccinating people antibodies. example, matter long ago infected? 

Honestly unless there's added risk ""over vaccinated"", think adds much complexity it'll ""easier"" continue vaccinating everyone current plan. previously confirmed infected take comfort knowing they're less risk get vaccination confirmed. ""Eradication

Yes obvious bias, general blatant TIME magazine wrote article nobody even bats eye ffs. Thanks u/candidly1 ! I'm guessing teacher. go education? i‚Äôve seen people gotten 2nd dose vaccine they‚Äôve felt worse next days entire life...

So, gotten - feel? every shot J&amp;J that's given one less shot vaccines, calculating long it'll take distribute shots.

Unless people find magic way get shot require health care professionals going slow distribution. lack health coverage, homelessness, extreme inequities. Everyone's health endangered links society barriers good health. Even someone zero compassion, taking care everyone makes us healthier. calling zero cases ever. 

Did read article all? 

Or see headline fearmonger it? I‚Äôm sorry point story don‚Äôt know sure ever covid? They've swabbed RaTG13 2013 report rest world 2020 pandemic already crossed international borders.

MIT/Harvard geneticist Alina Chan says *did* report it, '4991' paper published 2016.

Seasonality big one, human endemic coronavirus sharply seasonal. one peaks Dec-Feb N hemisphere 30 degrees. Also natural immunity 1/3 population many areas, virus lost many hosts. last factor, probably began assist acceleration decline (yes curve decline still increasing) vaccinations. Going March, April, May suspect help keep virus low levels prevalence severe cases, although small summer bump maybe occur coronavirus especially 30* well much smaller winter bump next year. EU setting similar standards testing revised covid19 vaccines. leads suspect believe going continuing issue. make rules something going happen.

also novavax said started work variant vaccine back January hope testing 2nd quarter iirc. still deciding one works best want booster bivalent (both current vax plus new one varient) really fearmongering saying 30% symptomatic people may something long term ""perhaps eventually fatal"".

You full shit part mate. ignorant comment. one child. One.

Legitimatly terrible kid

They didn‚Äôt flu risk kid way someone laughs way criticize public figures for, overwhelmingly women? Given reddit, say latter. missing point entirely. towards beginning pandemic, vaccine started phase 2 trials could vaccinated isolated 100 trail vaccine could used 100 coronavirus free unvaccinated volunteers exposed 200 coronavirus. get understanding effectiveness vaccine comparing viral load, onset symptoms, complications etc two groups.

This would allowed effectiveness trialed vaccine demonstrated without injecting large number people waiting get sick chance. benchmark would unvaccinated individuals effectiveness vaccine difference infection rates 2 groups. could also studied effect viral shedding Teachers teach remotely.

Yes, understand CEO COVID-19 resign instantly spring clearly looking good. Actually, asked source virus isolated. That‚Äôs all, wasn‚Äôt pushing conspiracy theory, asked clarification. What‚Äôs problem that? mean feel free quote prove wrong...

Do anything back claim Sweden‚Äôs locking despite official lockdown? literally watch videos YouTube people getting onto busy trains public transport without masks. Shopping centres full, completely normal.. maybe odd already compromised person want avoid covid would flu. 

It makes sense covid spreads one area another, understandably population differences doesn‚Äôt stop everyone cramming busses without masks. reflection ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù looking death rates don‚Äôt show different year. far 1,132,317 recieved first dose 1,657,215 total doses given. population Michigan 9,987,000.

That works 11.34% getting first dose 16.59 doses per 100 people. Kids need exposed flu; don‚Äôt catch they‚Äôre older would exposed higher risk complications lot. 45 Moderna + 250 Biontech = 150 mln vaccinated. Plus Novavax/Curevac/AZ/JJ.

Tiny micro cuts brain? literally writing science fiction positing fact. course nuanced that. I'm simplifying arguments dichotomy emerges nuance locked away. ?? about? much centralisation? anything EU's problem usually need get input approval member states anything. Look process went buying vaccines, EU first get money approved member states basically every single one opinion ordered, centralized approach would speeded things tremendously. would alternative buying collectively? Everyone themselves? mean sure would better bigger/richer countries like Germany could outbit others surely would improved European Unity. Would agree good step towards changing tide then? start somewhere, right? source that? find surprising obesity factor

I‚Äôm luck Google searching you‚Äôve stated

(Genuinely curious, trying give hard time) global pandemic. one suffered. sorry wanted point idiotism newswriters - sentence breaking news contain word 'may'. fact event breaking news assumption sure understand reply comment. know sub's stance anything TBH  gonna put here. country vaccinating people 30s trying open bars soon possible, neighbor lacks vaccine doctors prevent system collapsing, yes absolutely civilized thing do. Interesting - definitely agree last point, least, appreciate. 

My point re: everywhere compare states mostly open schools (SD, example, believe closed - are) states mostly still shut (CA) see curve pretty much exactly same, temporally bit. Across board, numbers going down, indicates schools much impact. places schools open still high places shut decreasing, we'd see bigger disparities state state less significant drop overall. They're volunteers, greater good. study could literally save millions. NZ...we cant close borders nzers want need come in...but manage risk listening science acting appropriately...not throwing hands saying freedom...the USA really put dumb freedom! I‚Äôm super worried Covid going create huge mental health crisis. want preface saying I‚Äôm anti masker even anti lockdown, think world filled anxiety already going see influx over. People wiping groceries, panicking catching Covid seconds exposed someone outside, keeping kids bubbles lives. would shocked see huge uptick generalized anxiety OCD this. Also, storable fridge temperatures (+2 - +8 C) think hit nail head. state published vaccine distribution plan ‚Äúpriority‚Äù tiers. idea vaccinate ones need most, end ‚Äúgeneral population.‚Äù

In mind, priority means limited group high need. Well, state published numbers. time get ‚Äúgeneral population,‚Äù it‚Äôs ~10% people state! Despite high risk underlying medical condition, I‚Äôve lumped low tier concerned could many, many months worry get vaccine. think there‚Äôs lot people need priority (even/especially me!). basically everyone given ‚Äúpriority,‚Äù anybody really it? That's feel overall Look recent measles outbreaks US. flu vaccine doesn‚Äôt keep people dying flu every year (even vaccinated people).

Vaccines aren‚Äôt silver bullet individuals. They‚Äôre tool keep majority population safe viruses. Viruses also mutate make vaccines less effective. vaccinated population prevents lot mutations happening viruses cannot replicate effectively vaccinated people.

I simply making argument idea herd immunity better. you‚Äôre failing understand vaccines way control herd immunity without killing massive number people.

Furthermore, young people immune? No. immune, simply don‚Äôt show symptoms nearly badly older people. still replicate spread virus. symptoms doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre immune. sub opening schools back up? guess anti-intellectualism wave Sure make entire population understand shot barely better placebo still distance, mask, avoid gatherings, work home, etc. judging ""got second shot WOOO HOOO LET'S EAT APPLEBEES!!! ROUND DRINKS BAR ME!!!"" reactions social media.... seem realistic. Amazon pretty much thing keeping household going. want sue somebody, sue Target, can't figure pack something without breaking it. Yeah, funny that. Lock working. told right-wing conspiracy theory. Guess not. someone explain like I'm five cuomo nursing homes? Uh huh. Yup. district almost completely in-person since August. We‚Äôre end state list vaccines. created lab wouldn‚Äôt mean released purpose Young people = 18-30 year olds. 

I feel like people read headline assume it‚Äôs referencing young children, children general. work takes financial support actual strategy make work, obviously happening here. Americans seem think financial costs long-term lockdowns something happen free.

And masks work and, spite people want believe, people comply mask mandates here. spreading misinformation COVID19 virus originated US. denial issue theorised happened Spanish Flu Pandemic. Mutations happen, happen damn fast. universal youre required sanitize going rides theyve hired people watch masks worn correctly Yikes someone sounds triggered. replies pretty aggressive, I‚Äôd try get control. Um... doctors China warning nations potential widespread outbreak? happened them? oh yeah, reprimanded Chinese authorities, that? knew look good them. outbreak first identified December 2019, March 2020 international travel bans put place. plenty time something now; exactly something went bad worse overnight. still don‚Äôt know much debilitating long-term effects CoVID, America even less new strains don‚Äôt genome sequencing relative countries. 

The April protestors didn‚Äôt vaccine horizon. yes, worse weren‚Äôt willing sacrifice **any** freedom, also idea whether vaccines could would developed distributed anytime soon. 

We vaccines work, know boosters developed. realize arriving decision refusing abide restrictions save lives personal fatigue less one year humanity‚Äôs first airborne blood disease places one camp April protestors now. 

Lots people voted candidate promised would ‚Äúlisten scientists‚Äù ‚Äúfollow science‚Äù disregard said scientists less one month term CoVID threatened ‚Äúgo away‚Äù like they‚Äôd thought.

I shudder think generational obstacles like Great Depression World War II would gone American side people back threw hands easily less one year unprecedented struggles. optimistic capacity overcome pressing challenges future see people ‚Äúinformed‚Äù crowd unwilling countenance science behind struggle lasts longer year. graphs FL NY looking completely different trying argue curve everywhere? Florida doctors better NY doctors last year they've swapped skill levels? age demographics trade places? Lmao Source?  incredibly common Asia.

Personally, quite enjoy wearing masks. stop catching coronavirus take five days work 'recover.' Hardly extinction. Hum guess made upü§£ That's gonna work children get time since still carrier even though vaccinated. Otherwise, teachers getting sick infecting kids infect parents. agree, much pain would averted Superbowl spike bound happen day right? shutting world economy unsustainable, there‚Äôs difference compared year ago. everyone‚Äôs already gotten vaccinated there‚Äôs unlikely doomsday case people still dying, won‚Äôt justify damn near every country economically socially falling abyss. unknown variables box, we‚Äôll clearly able see physical health consequences covid, compared economic mental health consequences forever(?) different isolated society

But regardless that‚Äôs highly unrealistic outcome, long-term evolutionary history viruses reduce symptom severity increase rate spreading. basically common cold, nobody gives fuck common cold. Shit even bringing there‚Äôs solid proof new variants working mRNA vaccines anyways. Sorry venting. offices could improve air quality borrowing practices schools, like removing mold controlling rodent infestations, painting dust vents instead cleaning them, training portion staff clients avoid covering sneezes coughs. boiled least. Amazing. cases rising country right now? zoom party 2-3 loudest people talking, everyone else watching. Vice President Harris say families inmates purposely kept able obtain parole could free slave labor fight forest fires California? 



*smirks giggles* yass queen pretty sure buy every single vaccine except covid right pharmacy walk Americans try take modicum responsibility failures. 

Even China deliberately created put gun head say, ""Now must elect leader call disease hoax hold big in-person rallies events ENTIRE course pandemic, must refuse try localize virus, must hold protests across country (far less demanding ones made so) efforts stamp virus, must elect president next demands schools reopened variants spreading, must let blatant disinformation spread 10 months avenues social internet media allowed anything it, and..."" 

We bother taking responsibility bothering learn this. blame China move on. problems. Let's blame fact huge plurality population believes deranged conspiracy theories elected maniac Russia! Nothing fault. think defensiveness leading see generalizations aren‚Äôt there. comment thread specifically teachers inoculated despite coming work. think depends state live in. I'm weary slowly things going relaxed Oregon, imagine capacity limits places general public frequents thing neighboring states east. got good fortune enduring North America‚Äôs strictest lockdowns completely decimated economy. missed party bro. B-but america bad! Dude take breath. You‚Äôre okay. isn‚Äôt healthy, chance catching anything limited exposure outside minimal. need professional mental health services. worry they've infecting people covid since March Inmates sentenced punishment via COVID, inmates first. False dichotomy. choices punishment all, WW3 lol. 210 million first number comes google, outdated. 

255 million 2019 sudden started talking different variants every day variants around since thing started?

Lack doom gloom news? death graphs adjusted age? 

Could lot initial deaths actually attributed medical malpractice? sticking people ventilators asap, know ideal solution. Hahaha, Americans can't accept responsibility failures. Pathetic. Without child vaccine, teachers forced go back work. already bad enough teachers always getting sick little germ balls, risk lives parents want free babysitting would conparing unknown. vaccine received clinical approval, used benchmark. plan pay longterm care infected may severe side effects life? easy think emotionally now, also means ignore long haul. Can‚Äôt even walk grocery store lick conveyer belts anymore without people looking like lunatic. Covid fucked everything. Hows 5G reception? Sucks bro, sorry hear that. less tbh. underestimate fresh air though. walk visit Dad every day wonders mental health.

It'll end soon hope, stay strong. variants? Schools entirely open hybrid classrooms. Hybrid worst model spread forces least 2 cohorts, provides inferior education. 

As far high risk teachers - high risk people offered opportunity WFH receive unemployment profession can‚Äôt done home. includes grocery workers etc. Instead focusing protections at-risk, we‚Äôve continued farce pretending stop Covid. Meanwhile 35-40% Americans Covid we‚Äôve caused enormous harm many shutdowns, particularly via school closures.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yeah think absolutely right, reading it. someone nursing home got covid died moved hospital, wasnt counted nursing home death (even caught nursing home).

That made nursing home deaths look quite terrible were. (and Cuomo probably wasnt alone fudging numbers) think fair say vast majority teachers hate remote learning too, trust school districts safely manage going back in-person learning.

Hopefully Chicago becomes model, teachers agreed reopening plan exchange vaccinating teachers first.

And obviously mentioned hand-wringing teeth gnashing US, something like 50% schools full-time partially in-person already.  11 days ago said almost completely better, said took 6 months. school staff here. Parents sending kids school want house

I'm sure expect teacher manage behavior side wall.

Send teachers room lunch? supervising kids? I've said.. better recruitment strategy works I'm sure they'd love hear it. Otherwise keep opinion yourself.

Or hard time understanding basic instructions? probably safe draft; basic reading comprehension skills. Summer 2022 maybe. even joking. feign infighting preserve status quo Read /u/callmetellamas' comment. They're studying different things. One natural biological differences people. Apparently obese elderly produce aerosol droplets. That's respiratory mechanics.

The social factors contribute young people spreading would we're likely essential workers, raising children, go socialize seniors. That's social behaviors work.

Not trying blame anyone. good investigate biological factors well social, contribute. Again, comparison faulty. One choose disagree/ignore/purge one aspect something, without disavowing entirely...This happened many times. Middle age christians killing muslims somehow make anti-religion...like what.  


Anti prefix literally means show opposition to. Ergo anti-intellectual/scientist would mean opposition science. country shows opposition science, would scientific breakthroughs.  


There many examples many countries exiling considered 'fringe' parts society. Americans burning witches mean anti-religion.  


Islamic countries opposing use interest mean anti-banking....like... anti intellectual want kids get covid? They‚Äôre still going school learning. It‚Äôs like jobs activities can‚Äôt done online.  German approach makes angry. feels like Merkel doesn‚Äôt even think companies file bankruptcy. Cases consistently going always wants extend lockdown changing incidence every month Awesome, thank you! ""It's unethical.""

Depends tell (and tell) participants. suggest read volunteer anything like Yep, sure did. grocery store workers? Can‚Äôt learn can‚Äôt even eat. SC governor said ""immoral"" ""let teachers jump line."" politicians allowed bullshit it‚Äôs party say ‚Äúit‚Äôs misquote!!!‚Äù makes think reopen? Many schools managed safety precautions. need funding. I've seen studies indicating low rates transmission asymptomatic people, great news vaccinations big problem know difference someone who's asymptomatic versus presymptomatic fact. much time prepare feel totally wasted!

Repeating emphasis. applies many aspects pandemic.  LeGM right thing much lose begin with, i've lost 10 pounds far still dropping. cleaned diet (more home cooking), got sober, started hiking. fair think issue EU. 45 Moderna + 250 Biontech. AZ deliver somewhere 40 200 AZ, 0-60 JJ, 0-60 Curevac 0-15 Novavax delivered end Q2. EU get something 335 630 million doses summer. 37 75% could potentially vaccinated summer. bro bill gates retired like decade ago since pretty much solely focused good around globe, including lots research money pandemic studies. predicted long time ago. listened back said prepared shit. Right long vaccines going arms that's really matters. bulk going suburbs means going cities later. need fucking prick.

Edit/ months ago. People didn‚Äôt magically burn throw emergency funds/savings/debts people keep carpet bombing sub falsehoods? There's evidence restrictions help. Even Ionnidis paper everyone keeps citing found stay home orders little impact finding school business closures preceding significant impact. can't pretend occupancy limits ""lockdowns"" destroying mental health claim ""lockdowns"" exclusively stay home orders pretend accompanying restrictions impact.

The estimate controls case counts nothing it. Read link. Meanwhile, Henry McMaster says ""immoral"" ""let teachers jump line."" üòê  mean people still gathered Bro, life last month already. going slightly nuts. mean leave apartment buy groceries week, free go outside, supposed go outside unless good reason to, don't. 
 
I live single-room apartment, friends city live in. look like lockdown going end next months either. sad Like cutting arm spitting wound? Everyone big wave infections winter, lot people got infected November - January. seems least plausible greatly increased amount immunity greatly slowed spread.

I'm sure explanation mind this. mean theyre anyway determined open schools again, may well make official thought kinds studies banned ethical reasons?? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I? paying me? care believe them. I'm saying read article. I'm obligated prove anything. love quotes. basically implying real ""experts""? hospitals ""overwhelmed""? believe that, complete kook. (Not OP, but...) pose good question. don‚Äôt know answer feel strongly discussed things *before* vaccine arrived. much time prepare feel totally wasted! Well.. unexpected Students perform poorly person inclined much worse online. Sounds like great way leave ones struggling dust. talk deserves silly opinion. Get shots arms let's get back normal. terrible name lol think masks good, aren‚Äôt magic many think are. Masks stressed long term indoor gatherings, plane rides, bus trips, trains, etc. Covid spreads spending lot time someone indoors, viral load critical. 

Spending five minutes gas station isn‚Äôt going likely lead infections anyways, studies shown long exposure necessary. still think wearing masks, it‚Äôs important long bus ride. 

I still think people set failure saying ‚Äúif everyone worse mask month pandemic would over.‚Äù Everyone NYC wearing masks months still getting infections Florida. am. I'm fully vaccinated still physical distancing older family members, estimate risk infecting someone else 1% vaccination, extended family agreed keep distancing degree skip masking. 150 kids tiny school. Daycares going smaller cohorts.

Something like 24% higher transmission rate communities open schools. lab leak credible theory though. lab already samples coronavirus.

Your account smells like CCCP sympathizer. you‚Äôre going use strong words like ‚Äúnever‚Äù twice, back sources. Otherwise you‚Äôre misleading people authoritarian language. Yea feel way too. I‚Äôm NJ. Ugh Thanks. believe you‚Äôre referring data showed PCR positive readings reduced 67% (CI: 49%, 78%) single dose, 50% (CI: 38% 59%) two dose regimen, supporting substantial impact transmission virus

It‚Äôs direct measurement, contain CT value, it‚Äôs good proxy start with.

So, ignoring fact shows NAAT+ protection efficacy withers time, tell me: would prioritize vaccine healthcare personnel, Pfizer‚Äôs, prioritize ? studies show you? 100% time, people criticizing things like voice, clothing, hair, laughter, overwhelmingly women criticized. went dirtbiking Black Hills April schools Sioux Falls closed. That's biggest city.

I pheasant hunted Aberdeen Mitchell week early December kids everywhere, schools open still empty. Enlighten us then, provide article. I‚Äôm sure 9 year olds thriving ipads add onto that. estimated Sweden record number deaths 2020. 98,000. 10% increase 2019, 8% higher average 2015 2019. 


Of course 2020 number yet official could end higher. US still counting 2020 death certificates could time. would bigger surprise get symptoms all. IIRC rate people getting mild symptoms (rash, fatigue etc) like 80-90% Tara Reade turned joke full shit. People lose businesses, cancel children‚Äôs childhoods stare four walls house years Civil Rights Movement, they? realize ridiculous analogy is? definitely typed horrible sentence original comment point I‚Äôm going leave it. vaccinated. wife isn‚Äôt. winter anyone vaccinated wants come house, even though data right common vaccine sense tells us mask isn‚Äôt needed, going ask guests wear mask. wear mask around child all. want data since it‚Äôs months easing masks guests around kids. definitely see set people original reply, feel like people start stuff. great day! Lmaoo

Had laugh there. Based I‚Äôve read feel like it‚Äôs combo post-holidays vaccines. I‚Äôve read various places first shot provides ~50% immunity. based results Israel far, small % vaccinated got covid fatalities. don‚Äôt think decline vaccines definitely part it. Plus herd immunity, I‚Äôm interested learning Yeah kids sitting home staring walls since last march measures have¬†seen non-essential businesses closed private meetings limited two households. 

This lie.

Churches open. plants, factories, facilities offices open. 

All schools closed. Retail closed fully.

Private meetings limited one person come. two. way build kids immunity flu, without getting flu.  virus made lab. That's conspiracy theory garbage, know it

I'm curious easily dismiss lab leak hypothesis. one (or least one worth taking seriously) saying virus deliberately released part nefarious conspiracy. there's great deal circumstantial evidence accidental leak. read article already. least, needs thorough investigation Wuhan Institute Virology's activities made lab, what? cares? you? humanity, ability fight virus, people who've lost loved one?

If made lab, confirmed, knowledge could help us prevent future outbreaks deadly viruses like Covid-19. want make sure catastrophically deadly accident like never happens again, indeed happen? seems unethical me. much feels like ""hey super poor good health, make money letting us make sick"". Yes, considered powerful teacher unions are? Here's thing, want vaccine proven effective. vaccine effective proven otherwise. Im pretty pessimistic based data SA study tbh doesnt really show effect SA variant gives strong indication shouldnt expect much all. wasnt discussion about. asked scientific proof protection hospitalization given resorted calling names such, suppose that's then. It‚Äôs reasonable assumption given data vaccines viruses we‚Äôve past vaccines significantly reduce spread disease. really annoys isn‚Äôt even taken account lot time organizations governments. Nah, think  agree essential workers (including retail employees) prioritized.

This right here.

I'm lowly bartender/server/host restaurant, directly interfaced general public 5-6 days week 6-8 hours day. literally face face 50 - 100 adults every day, include commute public transportation. Saying teacher might handle regular group kids 2-3 days week deserves priority kinda bullshit. Actually didn‚Äôt say anything get power. literally hid basement waited Trump implode. genius really didn‚Äôt make many campaign promises. not. vaccines approved younger population take them. I‚Äôm sure lot Americans mental deadline Civil Rights movement, World War II, Great Depression year. Somehow, someway, adjusted expectations pressed ahead overcome. 

In three situations, America emerged great struggles better stronger country struggles revealed deficiencies national fabric needed addressed.

I haven‚Äôt seen anything thread ‚Äúdone CoVID‚Äù turning focus forcing demands government allow CoVID ‚Äúlived through‚Äù. done, world around go hell handbasket. precisely logic April protestors, tape-delay. think main issue isolation. speak doctors obviously got phone 12 days room tough. There's lot videos YouTube flu camp couple I'd say tell they're going slightly nuts. drive car? Ever fly plane? Buy goods made factory? Eat food grown fertilizer protected pesticides? Use electricity?

&amp;#x200B;

All things involve value judgments, one entails societal cost, whether death injury vehicle accidents environmental damage danger public health pollution. things one complete jackass would label ""pro death"".

&amp;#x200B;

And sacrifice wearing mask about. Europe almost everyone wears masks they're still locked down. Ireland Level 5 lockdown since Christmas likely May. I'm fine wearing mask. I'm fine allowed go office visit parents travel across country FOREVER, ""pro science, anti death"" crowd really pushes hard around here. want talked like murder children want daughter birthday party see actual children person again. would pediatric doctors source authority infectious disease?

Hint: aren't. Totally understand point view, agree, ain‚Äôt right. hey, see one less selfish person could spread supermarket! Yeah man, TED Talk it. definitely agree social behavior contributed spread. Especially holidays. think vaccine distribution ramps up, social interaction lot less likely cause covid much less prevalent. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs lot people hoping point Whats agree unions? union agrees vaccinated ones distributing. could put pressure city state setup appointments best. got downvoted right - containing virus benefits economy. even scientifically sound (which think - vaccinations pace get us herd immunity fall latest), way stadiums, concerts, movie theaters remain shut 2022. going happen. Would willing share paper pulling information from? able find anything indicates virus able enter blood brain barrier, let alone leave 'micro cuts.' Only?

I doubt holidays impact. much? Exactly, people getting fairly worthless underpowered study young people forgetting ungranulated data showing severe disease protection unequivocal.

Some elderly wind ICU decision...  Guess told ""Oh well, still remdisivir.."" DOD also spend $815 million increase domestic production testing supplies materials. funding go toward manufacturing supplies including filter pipette tips, polymers used antigen tests, injected molded plastics house testing reagents.

That's great. Lack available testing still huge issue. oversimplistic say one particular thing. sort fly shit pepper day long how's concept - combination many complimentary factors! Tens millions recovered naturally, tens millions vaccinated, holiday gatherings far enough behind us longer influence numbers, people large *are* careful despite cries contrary. great things contribute unprecedented drop cases we're witnessing. Nobody wants say social behavior role spread deadly airborne viral pneumonia. suggestion family Christmas party killed grandma summarily dismissed. See Easter. not. ""American Exceptionalism"" indeed. wont be. Many business cannot make profit reduced capacity. Great news Source models? not. Sorry. one forcing people this, they?

Headlines: **DOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!** sure you‚Äôre downvoted, would like see downvoters response answer question mean deserve know truth. throw hands say, ""oh well."" No, apply nurses require high amount training enter field

Once already field, require amount training order work covid patients. keep working order keep receiving salary. Also, I'm talking nurses, professionals make choice potentially exposed covid order get living wage (which includes professions cleaning staff receptionists, relatively high paying profession 

They get paid working patients, forced work covid patients get exposed virus order continue getting paid. high paying profession make vulnerable exploitation, given work expose risks order get paid. also exposure based though? 65 year old co-worker comfortably working home prioritized 40 year old teacher exposed little kids every day? evident doesnt care point. would absolutely this.

Someone seemingly non-ironically wrote ""All praise Fauci. Amen."" several upvotes. better recruitment strategy works I'm sure they'd love hear it.

Here's one: recruit children.

Maybe insult someone's reading comprehension make stances defend. public spaces social distancing possible like grocery store public transit? Sure. big deal, worth minimize chance transmission virus widely control. Further, there's practical way distinguish anti-masker vaccinated person. 

In private around friends family vaccinated? Absolutely not. link interview? ""Many countries"" specialized equipment make mRNA vaccines. Amazon morally bankrupt corporation: environmentally otherwise. That's I've boycotted them, use buy books. OK, articles citing?

[NY Times] perhaps graphs provides article? trustworthy author opinion?

The person replied provided two articles outbreaks schools. Yep, happen. discuss whether outbreaks anywhere happen, whether students teachers better school. data Oster cites makes opposite argument.  need find something better do. I.. I'm sure one. seems unethical inject someone deadly virus. Either way, hope everyone turns alright.. China technocracy 90s 00s. Xi increasingly purged technocrats favor loyalists though. U keep spreading worse rolling vaccines fast u can

If areas small enough maybe prioritize vaccines state. localized stick previous plan.

Actually enforcing mask distancing mandates putting place first time. 

Maybe federal aid tied mask mandates states regions stop refusing govener certain states stop blocking cities enforcement  think plausible explanation we're seeing spike caused holidays disappearing... Yeah parents can‚Äôt take work get 4 sick days year Many countries specialized materials machinery, sourced relatively quickly, entirely patent distribution issue. picture cars snaking lines... guess that's people waiting vaccinated? can't force us get vaccinations

I understand, least opportunity vaccinated. investigated concluded didn‚Äôt anything wrong Yes let's forget one kid perfect attendance High School got certificate assembly it. Like cool dude nanny got school time. Oh college admissions reps that'd come talk like big accomplishment would give edge admissions since showed dedication school.

And living friends couches working odd jobs survive could graduate. ya fuck able get class time everyday car start. good one one implausible. Countries across world reaching ""population"" immunity nearly time despite different case levels, different population levels, different mitigation strategies, etc. Additionally, claim made numerous times 2020 explain drop cases - even places later still winter surge.

No.

This wrong.

Of course party could apply lot pressure. wanted to.

Venn diagram people bashing teachers people pontificating vast importance fucking circle think saying untrue all, even someone extremely optimistic vaccinations know going live world pandemic done. I'm hoping new normal brings good though, like sick people wearing masks public better sanitation restaurants. harmless little things everyone benefits from. 

That said, way fucking hell going wear mask I'm healthy pandemic over. also whole idea vaccine passports issued domestically get people bars, stadiums, etc. That's asking really dangerous precedent level US surveillance post 9/11. People bottleneck, vaccine production is. pretty easy pay nurse poke someone. Hell, even need degree job. I'm sure getting total disinformation needed. entire global narrative vaccines produced, rolled out, distributed fast enough. That's Europe Canada way want be, many countries waiting years. US unique able buy up/bully doses greater extent anyone else world, still talking taking better part year get enough. Every dose wasted someone need simply prolongs self-inflicted crisis.

I'm going one mass vaccination sites, ever. need it. I'm going make sure ""my"" dose goes someone does, doomers shut let life get back normal. Look profile. shut hell up. agree. think 65+ prioritized teachers. look actually suffering dying most, it‚Äôs 65+ folks. Teachers retail workers next.

I would't panic. lack concern safety expressed I'm glad suffering children. Although feel around much selfishness display shows little concern would sending little infection vectors school. possible chances low. 


Basically exposure infected person (masks not) chance infection. 

Masks reduce chance shorter durations also reduce chances. district told secondary schools won‚Äôt opening campus county year. feel won‚Äôt prioritized teacher. make sense, won‚Äôt back physical classroom August, wait little longer get vaccinated. grandma fell (because she‚Äôs 90 falls happen often age) would fine. would fine all.

Tonight Mass opening vaccinations people 2+ comorbidities 65+, means mom eligible! Pray get appointment soon! Yup, every virtualized real event I've ""gone"" sucked. Including comedy show hear laughter everybody muted. Rough. indeed. say needs unwarranted. However, kid goes school, gets notice he/she exposed covid, must quarantine 2 weeks (and extension, entire family), happens family? handle said quarantine, others can't. most, missing two weeks work means unemployed. current state unemployment, there's semi decent chance get UI benefits deserve. costs rises exponentially can't afford miss work.

So, family takes risk, goes work, there's new vector spread.

Not enviable position. draw line? Assuming there's spread Covid, teacher dies due covid complications. Now, who's going bear costs litigation, settlement, etc? Ultimately, everyone us.

I'm taking position ""just mean we?"" wise decision open schools folks free baby sittings (which folks use) whereas others can't afford two weeks quarantine become spreaders themselves, knowing kids exposed?

Edit: yes, there's huge class divide schooling exposed. ideal world, children would good internet access necessary digital tools succeed. we've seen, US terrible internets, let alone equipping children succeed.  They‚Äôve way now. Even COVID, virulently anti school choice protect themselves, even though things like charter schools godsend people poor/bad school districts.

With essential workers, there's also debate jobs ""essential"" jobs higher risk.

I hope gets heavily fined illegal stuff did. President US we're talking about, middle school student government. lacks ability clearly communicate matters utmost importance, serious problem... think impossible scientists varying opinions data?

Different opinions can't correct. I'm pointing stats make one wrong opinions. Right.

Guess depends read wearing mask, wearing mask **may** make little difference many people caught flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people)

That, me, says jury still effectiveness; mask wearing seem protect mask wearer.

There‚Äôs significant proportion general public upset teacher unions right now. schools continue stay closed start next school year, revolt among angry parents, included. seems idea who‚Äôs actually risk covid. Overwhelmingly it‚Äôs elderly, point would better 28 year old obese cancer patient healthy 85 year old covid outcomes. Honestly putting anyone 65 ahead anyone older makes sense. Ouch, wish y‚Äôall smooth sailing then. You‚Äôre great seen video guy refusing answer sort question Taiwan? even went far hang interviewer asking questions. don‚Äôt refuse acknowledge Taiwan‚Äôs existence without compromised CCP, they‚Äôre group vested interest so.  18 30 children. age considered adults ability drink, smoke, go war. papers seen looks fertility males SARS-CoV-2 infection? know speculation, since testes ACE-2 receptors, mean virus actually interacts testes. yet case US. Atleast parent in-laws 70s still vaccine. high risk condition. take many weeks get there. last line CNN ""expert"" worthy problem that. absolutely invest improving school infrastructure safety. Schools criminally underfunded decades. Herd Immunity? Seasonality? Well, that's whole separate issue. That's harmful unnecessary. that's presented original comment. 

I see nothing wrong someone sharing regimen make feel safe, even think much. see something wrong trying make people feel bad wanting semblance social life. point, there's reason treat people like that. 

If want stay home, fine, discuss like-minded individuals, there's reason try shame others. goes want stay home. That's fine, try shame others staying home they're shaming you.

schools need restructuring. Schools still run model cranking factory workers. Listen, obey, time, told else. New York California hospital workers: *how cute* vaccines currently approved use children anyway, it‚Äôs completely valid consider percentage people vaccinated population that‚Äôs *able* get vaccinated.  Currently right now. Turns sitting couch drinking year top smoking pork shoulder every weekend really pack pounds. Age corrected IFR around 0.17-.2% Manaus. .17% excess deaths occurred. less 50% infected, saying real age adjusted IFR DOUBLE prevailing estimates younger biased populations. making point think making. thousands thousands teachers teaching face face right now‚Äîit varies state. saying. OP lazy upvote interesting perspective, though think link supports assertion one way another ""not true"". [non-epidimiologist] guy cite even says:

""I'll end obligatory: argument relaxing restrictions, cases still quite high, variants coming, let's crush thing further.

Still, I'd love see debate epis happening, e.g. seasonality underrated."" assert (faster anticipated) drop cases due vaccinations. People saying ‚ÄúwHo WoUlD THiS‚Äù: young people volunteer military service wartime. volunteer knowing full well could sent front lines die, fellow countrymen. honor. many reason. imagine people volunteer trial vein. article extremely vague, information first phase target vaccinated unvaccinated. I've seen nothing clear UK intends here. makes sense intend test unvaccinated, however, true, seen anything stating approved pre- (or non) vaccinated people (as still get infected vaccinated studying immune response could valuable). I'm aware it.

But, actually case, I'm saying isnt.

Why places, pretty much time? hit magical immunity number within week other?

And case, threat 3rd wave conversation. Shoot, finally excuse *not* go see someone's child know anyone child. can't freeze things without power. can't keep turkey cold without power. dont power days eat lasts longest. tried cooler thing ice would melt fast foods would spoil ate shelf stable processed foods lasted longer. went week sometimes without hot water hot food. kid parents poor could keep us fed. good tips people better circumstances though. I'd like addendum article vague, mentions studies target both. get you‚Äôre saying, entire state face face. I‚Äôve teaching person since August. states approaching differently thousands thousands teachers need vaccine ASAP. Spot on. amount criticism astounding. parents act like buy teacher $25 starbucks card December means teacher somehow owes life. two party system ever produce 2 crappy options. Reopening? Y'all closed schools?

I staying sister, teacher. recovered covid. Got school teach person despite overwhelmed covid bus drivers such, kids HOURS late. 

Schools closed right due snow. Ehhhhhhh sure. say feeling great week ago many aren‚Äôt vaccinating? key point ‚Äî vaccines haven‚Äôt impacted drop. Worldometers doesn‚Äôt answer question. massive collection data? correlated anecdote?

How - schools currently open Wisconsin? cases decreasing schools driving spread? course there's whole moral superiority complex around following rules I'm worried nobody going want one say anything. careful supportive mask mandates things getting better, keep getting better, want wear mask one second longer need honestly. Moderna first injection March 17th: could've challenge trial end March latest. problem exists pretty much every else world. Name one country kept schools open significant vector transmission disease.

The studies consistently showing problem. Even CDC says safe. think important too. think teachers deal close quarters without protection. K students sense personal space constantly sneezing me. think grocery store workers same. face-to-face people every day. Plus, they‚Äôve since day 1 pandemic. 

I think teachers, grocery store workers funeral home workers prioritized now. know talking about. Coming summer months falling case number risk people fully vaccinated general public starting way would overwhelm hospital system. Hospitalizations common healthy 60 population. course happen people, enough overwhelm health care system especially risk vaccinated low overall case numbers. time winter everyone vaccinated.

I doctor. wrong. Yeah beginning like ""I'd rather stay inside careful months get covid.""

""I'd rather stay inside careful year get covid"" different story. Cannot smell farts also cannot smell Mercaptan, yeah. Ive thought many times. Although smell mostly back. month covid. cannot say sentence/paragraph/interview opening schools essential even critical yet vaccinating teachers essential/critical.

Cart horse. dare insist opening schools without vaxing teachers even administrators. freaking savages right-wing-nuts.

ps. important point unfortunately federal goverment control state prioritized vax, governor wants give bestest buddies biggest campaign donors literally horror country Great! Yep, really heading somewhere positive. need little patience. Holler need vent! always going level risk everything, I'd happily accept level risk presented article chance helping whole world beat Coronavirus. also trust medical professionals UK, held high standards accountability believe study would continue risks great making out. 

Specifically, assertion 50% people get 'brain fog' overegging little, UK office national statistics experimentally reporting 1 5 6 weeks Coronavirus, 1 10 12 weeks infection - that's *all* long symptoms. I'm confident would reduced via specifically selected population, safe controlled environment. 

I'm sure person gave green light deserves fired they're trying right thing.  part discredits news outlet. even know fucking difference Sure.

I get onboard idea says vaccines stop rebound.

But people going look think related vaccines. true. They're effective variant virus South Africa. Efficacy 25% high probability zero. agree more. Doctors, Nurses, Policemen Policewomen Firefighters Teachers. There...I said priority. people it‚Äôs mild flu. Hence spreads rapidly - walk around without noticing. gamble it‚Äôs much worse, average person trial hard-pressed even record symptoms. Look US colleges reopened - stopped bothering count got 100k positive students 2 hospitalizations. World Cup isn‚Äôt summer 2022, it‚Äôs Nov/Dec  entitlement work job see loved ones? god far gone   first argument isn‚Äôt valid ethics subjective? logic, aren‚Äôt statements ethics meaningless? time somebody points something unethical, say ‚Äúethics subjective‚Äù dismiss them. position? vaccines cause drop. really know caused drop.

That's huge. That's every district union MOU contracts must rewritten. spoke priority, making new law spread virus completely halted substantially reversed, indicating we're well herd immunity threshold current level distancing. guess latter point they're trying make (it's herd immunity went back business usual). Nice Strawman argument. say military necessary.

I said military recruiting children. didn‚Äôt say anything organ damage related symptoms, treating symptoms. I‚Äôm teacher. I‚Äôve worked school entire school year. Teachers across district kids classrooms without access vaccines. high schoolers classroom without access vaccine. true community spread live incredibly high positivity rates reaching 30%. classrooms teens spread like adults community openly refuses follow guidelines prevent spread. also evidence fraction cases actually found entire families get sick exposure get tested. 

As teacher situation ‚Äî someone family member die ‚Äî get frustrated see generalizations awful teachers being. worked harder year career. put family risk. sacrificed great deal best students. 

If anyone claims don‚Äôt deserve priority access vaccinations, question understanding really do. flat wrong. wasted years life grad school doesn‚Äôt mean better anyone else.

It's shame (and annoying) many people PhDs think opposite. anyone thinks lab accident debunking strictly related, not. genomic study done last year start outbreak using variants US UK genomic features described may explain part infectiousness transmissibility SARS-CoV-2 humans. Although evidence shows SARS-CoV-2 purposefully manipulated virus, currently impossible prove disprove theories origin described here. However, since observed notable SARS-CoV-2 features, including optimized RBD polybasic cleavage site, related coronaviruses nature, believe type laboratory-based scenario plausible.

We really stop pursuing lab accident angle nail China wall based lack transparency virus knew infected killed 3 people 7 years ago. lab accident sort absolves culpability intentional cover seriously implicates culpable. dead winter, esp within Christmas 3 week window, would predictably worse. couple weeks, March, part Spring. Thus, numbers go down, without vaccine. Until, govt appropriate agencies deign actually inform subjects vaccine may may affecting drop-off, never really know vaccine impact it. suspect right minimal.

So..... even know it? Indeed. military necessary evil. like it, change fact. better way recruiting, I'm sure military would love suggestion. inability manufacture anything pandemic related within country even whole year

I get sentiment general wanted add large-scale production RNA vaccines novel‚Äîthis time last year _nobody_ knew would efficacious could mass-produce‚Äîso think fact places churning accomplishment part, necessarily failure others'.

For worth, Pfizer-BioNTech CureVac mRNA vaccines rely LNP delivery system developed Vancouver-based [Acuitas Fair enough, indeed specifically talking article. I‚Äôve never seen anyone ‚Äúwishing kids perish.‚Äù talking people like understand willful recklessness indoor crowds without masks? want people wear masks don‚Äôt get sick. It‚Äôs opposite harsh incorrect interpretation. 

I wonder interpret concern people carelessly exposing virus wanting dead? Seems extremely twisted me. open schools without vaccine kids disease known affect kids much less potential significant illness children five year old playing dirt washing hands properly‚Äîwhich happens don‚Äôt send home zoom class.

What mean? Schools shut one case meningitis. Kids can't go school Children. Should. Go. To. School. Without. A. Vaccine. Period.

Ok Bill Shatner. guess makes anti-vaxx then? don‚Äôt agree. Masks large gatherings limited least early summer way hit critical mass vaccinations. restrictions lifted next month two current numbers hold grocery workers? think means extended family members don‚Äôt live them. word Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine availability? think much confidence study flies face massive collection data. think exactly right. loved ones could knocked flu well blamed anyone. easier blame people shit barely control over. Says lot character. Stay safe tho ‚ù§ really dumbass... coming someone who's going working... dont know talking about. Shut fuck epidemiologist, Common Sense? you? normal people's minds also means hundreds thousands Americans dying millions hospitalized.

but happened America literally every day life. thing changed perception awareness it. work government. Say going something don‚Äôt anything wait people forget. long study last? 29 Days? husband less priority. nation's obsession vaulting educators onto pedestal strange.

But felt way pandemic. Common sense: ""Yes."" mean we‚Äôve sustained without larger gatherings like concerts wearing masks year. easily sustain another four months. aspects life back normal mostly back normal April exception maybe strict places. Major difference people asked wear mask work public spaces everyone reasonable opportunity vaccinated early summer. Seems like actual reality two different things.

Also, world big place - specific. Facts matter prefaced ‚Äúalmost 20%‚Äù. Spouting falsehoods one thing rounding another. Regardless 15.69% almost 20% book. You‚Äôre sitting waiting pounce people percentages seems lol. Behavior March/April 2020 one thing, nearly March 2021 know lot better sure. onlyfans underwhelming K dense. said question was.

Should teacher required room 30 unmasked kids without vaccinated? No.

Should parents kids option send kids school safe time outside house? Yes.

What possible solutions? Vaccinate teachers, temporarily find another teacher willing take risk, send either kids teachers room lunch, build plexiglass wall teacher kids, think 100 things. true remote lol 
I 3 channels growing up. üòÇ need apples. buy tons stuff cans processed store long time. freeze things.

There many alternatives people seem realize. saw someone say going grab fast food burger fries cheaper easier spending hours cooking healthy meal. know what's also cheaper easier picking fast food? Making turkey sandwich. first group vaccinated. first phase research aims establish smallest amount virus needed cause infection. 


The SECOND group (which yet approved) vaccinated, quote referring to. dumb article. Except vaccinating high-spread background pretty effective applying evolutionary pressure vaccine evading variants. Otherwise yes agree, thing would end summer. trial going control group study vaccinated volunteers take place one. 

We vaccines early 2020 compare challenge trial against. close border want people still get in. Source: live US.

Island? same. Stoner: ""Do COVID antibodies make immune COVID?""

CDC: ""Even though that's case every illness, can't take evidence true COVID-19.""

CNN: ""Vaccine Passports Must Access Businesses, Schools, Travel"" Yeah, make easy avoid exposed COVID! good point, think right now, sticking masks. hope come spring/summer things change, don‚Äôt wear masks house child reading faces speak worth Opening everything without primary spreaders disease vaccinated fast way getting overwhelmed healthcare system.

The healthcare system okay today, opening everything elderly get vaccinated asking healthcare system collapse. unlikely chinese bots. even worth looking appear still dropping. covid denier I‚Äôd happily lived Europe. 
I‚Äôm personally terrified getting covid even terrible symptoms, it‚Äôs name science possibility help scientists learn virus. Proof? don‚Äôt see reason they‚Äôd hide it. essential service would definitely make regulators think really hard shutting site down. anything rigorous. think many institutions want come across cold. never needed chicken pox vaccine go school... MMR, sure. No, think is.

They trying say long Covid issue they'll treat Covid ""runs course"", frankly there's known way stop Covid becoming long Covid. well understood.

Treating symptoms Covid guaranteed prevent someone contracting long Covid. could worse.... last guy No, countries choose brands. covid reason. nothing stopping flying dubai get good one. probably true, outdoors. find comment fucking ridiculous. Oh family members house wear mask. Big fucking deal. Yes want socialize. shut in, yes also want fucking precautious child. highly doubt it. would bet money things like full stadiums, concerts, movie theaters anytime 2021. CDC bodies claimed relatively safe classroom certain precautions taken even without vaccine.

When we're talking potentially lethal &amp; highly contagious illness, think *really* need define ""relatively safe"" ""certain precautions"" actually mean. path hell paved good intentions. answer seatbelts good idea, government business compelling make good choices. Otherwise end - government get tell eat? wrong (like low fat craze?). use justification of, ""well government already laws like this"" justification more, literally slippery slope argument based on. That's I'm putting foot down. more. viable alternative solutions. I'm sorry things suck bad things occasionally happen, running state make go away helping.

The technical answer use existing legal structures place deal sorts philosophical questions. system place already, called congress. bypassed entire social civil order 1-year long ""emergency"" orders thrown agreed-upon framework window. keep abusing agreed upon rules, eventually people decide rules meaningless, get anarchy totalitarianism, depending wins. Ok, intentionally dense? cafeterias. currently required kids eat classroom. deliberate decision 30 kids exposed other‚Äôs germs, rather hundreds. Teachers get ZERO say this, vaccinated. different situation retail worker brief contact masked people. choice exposed quit. reasonable choice.

Illinois peaked November 13 basically tapered there. vocal minority upset ‚Äúunnecessary lockdowns‚Äù never saw holiday spike clearly worked. 

Glad Pritzker control. lol @ one realizing churchill quote downvoting you, reddit crazy kids get vaccinated teachers shouldn‚Äôt even school. teachers vaccinated stop kids infecting kids bring home possibly kill family. Interesting! seen analyses use value others evaluate costs benefits restrictions? ya got I'd rather dead. question alternative? Several experts said something along lines ""masks 100% need people stay home avoid inessential travel socialising, rather wearing masks continuing normal"". Hi, actually work public school. work private school part union. know people working, people come contact large number people--let alone young children understand ""stay 6 feet apart""--each work day. 

Yes, people do, like retail workers. agree--they ALSO vaccinated work safely!

I never claimed special. saying think teachers vaccinated schools open safely. vein, believe retail workers vaccinated work safely. VACCINES EVERYONE! push open schools make everyone come back, feel priority moment, outside rightly need vaccine first, like health conditions.

I know hate public schools much, know experience, I'm sorry school negative experience you. Teachers school spun dime flip remote working, hybrid working, kids class online. overwhelming majority teachers want work. Teachers want able teach! Vaccines let them. mass senicide occurring UK‚Äôs care homes , elderly residents tested &amp; daily ramp positive tests left die &amp; added death tally obviously made quote trolling you.

Thank ted talk.
FUCK. said UK wouldn‚Äôt. said science rushed. said vaccine separation dime wrong.

Later apologised, damage. still like perfect scientist always. me, much getting back normal life although also is. want live life desperately.

To me, getting vaccine feeling protected. pointed also point person replied to. would Dr. Scott Atlas remember trump's covid doctorü§£ü§£ Although assume flu cases less likely officially diagnosed, official ones probably skew severe, flu's real death rate lower that, right? Concerts full movie theaters won‚Äôt year Nope, briefing yesterday said colleagues considered close contacts tested. Ah, wait, read comment above! Think globally.

Go compare Quebec NY Florida.

Different approaches. Different vaccination roll outs. 

Same curve. alter title? look US regionally, see cases, come regions, like Midwest, peaked Thanksgiving dropped. False positives extremely unlikely, almost unheard of. won‚Äôt year. personally would question.

If kids eating classrooms dealbreaker teachers change it. either kids teachers leave room eat make arrangements. Every school I've ever cafeteria library.

It people lost ability work solution. would interesting could show persistently exposing volunteers low levels virus built immunity. IIRC, ER employees antibodies show higher ammouts antibodies constant exposure. *Xenophobia Hard disagree what? people decline vaccine want to, regardless reason?

Afaik proof covid-19 leaves permanent damage long term damage someone like (worst case) lasts maybe months. purely anecdotal course, friends mine got infected boredom quarantine worse virus lol. old, overweight multiple health problems I'd definitely take vaccine. 

Even then, media ramping fear talking kinds new strains vaccine work against, might need annual shot instead two 'jabs' get now. what's point? trust media, trust government promote vaccine heavily trust vaccine either. Thanks, far still quite low numbers compared many countries, hopefully people wake yet manage stop really gets hand need drastic measures bring control. won‚Äôt years, ever. need accept live new normal... real. countries that, least planning that. point need vaccines inside people, period. Anyone get flu vaccine every year, point moot.

Kids go school pre-COVID unless vaccine shot regimen date lot illnesses maybe kill dozen kids year without vaccine, yet still required. open schools without COVID vaccine widely available everyone disease known spread rampantly still potential significant illness children potential long term effects?

It's pretty ironic. People kept slamming others anti-vax advocating children go school without vaccine. exactly locked tight? friends young urban professionals post-grad degrees. Probably likely demographic strictly follow guidelines. NYC, DC, Seattle, Denver, San Francisco, none spent Christmas alone. Nothing respect toward people see friends family number.  Anecdotally, time last year coming home mobiliation I'm pretty sure contracted COVID (but able verify antibody test). February June least, massive brain fog. I'm 25, average muscular build, brain fog multiple months sucks. brain fog seemed lessened around time started running outside warm. think exercise might helped, study hand back claims like that. finite vaccines distribute establish hierarchy need. Currently, states prioritizing based minimizing fatalities, accomplished vaccinating at-risk groups first. this, 65+ large highest priority, many people still received vaccine states long wait times. Allowing young, low-risk teachers ‚Äúskip line‚Äù would increase total fatalities complete certainty, therefore health experts advising it. motivation politicians political - ‚Äúsounds good‚Äù prioritize teachers even kills people. guess time overturn right-to-work laws, right? I'd say 50,000 pounds per quality adjusted life year. roughly standard many health authorities use determining new medical treatments worth cost. People complain deals take much time, seems lot thought goes them. Lol half Texas doesn‚Äôt even power. Houses don‚Äôt heat. People don‚Äôt even winter tires. People aren‚Äôt going fucking anywhere  Counting 18+ gets 15.69% 1+ dose based Census data[0], people 18&lt; still transmit virus. case, said 20% able back up. 

[0] Ability recall words. Brain fog. Still hope it‚Äôs permanent finally studies long haulers. Hopefully treatment options coming. I'm comparing containment processes policies associated it. I'm talking purely process finding origin virus.

Are going continue pretending outraged one knows origin Covid mere 1 year? young, formerly healthy individual, prior conditions struggled nearly year covid study makes nervous. Hopefully controlled environment keep safe understanding monster. know economic status? Lmao probably A-ok. 99 percent people gotten virus are. saying US saying state useful saying found 'in Europe' 'in Africa' True, fair enough! It‚Äôs horrible you‚Äôre put position. I‚Äôm risk essential worker well choice work. shouldn‚Äôt pay PPE, goes without saying. happen properly fund educational system put position. that‚Äôs neither there. We‚Äôre suffering thing way another, though equally. already shitload shortfalls education system Covid even brought it.

None fundamentally changed argument im bringing though. clear ‚Äúteachers get go teach.‚Äù Wow. Okay. nuts course hate fit people. That's dumb. 

And yes I'm advocating fat shaming looking obesity prospective telling people ""eat less, exercise more"" must fatso fat people could concerned fat people. Nah stand science political props Right? huge let peeve mine. out-of-context quote makes every thread. Thank explanation. pity going surge tight now. Hopefully gets sorted soon Especially realize human brain takes well past 18 develop gain proper awareness mortality. places closed summer? totally sure. wife teacher registered VDH system 2 days ago. morning checked Fairfax County system (there's way verify registration). morning got text message VDH telling register Fairfax County system. registered registration shows up.

If unsure I'd call them. want fall cracks. would love get earlier, point I'm keeping expectations low especially poorly Illinois done rollout. tons studies proving birth control pills cause weight gain cause fluid retention. form BC proven cause weight gain Depo shot unless depo shot probably mental/mood thing result pills. Anecdotes =\= facts


Losing weight/fat (not bloat) literally calories vs calories out, even folks medications weight controlled diet proper nutrition based around meds taking. Bloating water retention different thing obesity think two often mixed up. There‚Äôs huge difference official declaration recognition completely avoiding mention Taiwan point you‚Äôll get extremely defensive hang interviewer. kind false equivalency CCP apologism sounds like you‚Äôre China, Taiwan. basis this? get virus completely fine. Micro cuts brain? Stop regurgitating propaganda. Fauci came said wasn‚Äôt accurate. Ah ok makes sense thanks replying. never referred using pediatricians sole source information. moving goal posts.

The first comment stated pediatricians authority speak infectious disease, infectious disease large part field. point. MPHs CDC may final word, say doctors actually trenches treating watching children's lives authority nonsense. CDC see damage done kids kept schools, either. literally deal COVID nothing else, fault. Appreciate post, write something obviously slanted one sided complain people attack it.  Huh? would factor people received single dose J&amp;J vaccine back people still need get it? 166 cases Orange county, CA today. 3500 early January. 

I never thought freaking case numbers would make misty. never expected get low, *this fast.* seems obvious missed serious scientist, find reference control age study. say accounted age, controlled it. Agree schools reopen teachers chance get vaccinated. fair essential workers high risk people teachers prioritized, continue work remotely. like 1918. bad suggests virus mutate actually make healthiest people get sickest Keep attitude asking others join Anti-China Anti-Russia campaign, *what goes around comes around.*  I'm sure find personnel. shortage people sitting home nothing. Maybe pull nurses latest tiktok skit. 

Yeah CDC also says stay 6' away, despite recommendation based exactly nothing. qualms participating security theater long politically convenient. course going tell people get jab - best interest keep people it. make advice less stupid.

It change math vaccine used person antibodies much much useless someone antibodies. 95% gain vs 1 million gain. change extra doses sitting hand actual bottleneck becomes people perform jabs, isn't. like need pHd operate syringe. Go retrain contract tracers never actually accomplished anything. alright thank deep-dive. don‚Äôt understand. saying someone high temperature safe let come in? guess depends define normal? Hanging strangers indoors without *legally to* masks? Everything open? Yeah, back Labor Day.

Normal like second guessing applying hand sanitizer keeping mask car, case? years. 

Normal like people dying hundreds avoidable illness? never. winter storm might start showing stats. two weeks. Early outbreak, New York first hardest hit, nursing homes especially bad, became crisis residents generally good health nowhere go well taken care of. Many got sick suspected Covid, hard tell much testing. sent hospitals, overcrowded, recovered point could sent back nursing home (which ""home"" all). priority send home hospitals filling up. still contagious brought virus back nursing home. continued exacerbated cases spreading nursing homes led illnesses deaths. Statistically 40% Covid fatalities nursing homes nationwide.

This got boiled ""Cuomo sent sick Covid patients back nursing homes covered deaths"" kind true clear options really solely making decisions. vaccines emergency use authorization cannot force troops get according federal law. almost certainly weather. lot numbers yesterday seemed comparitively low. probably going wait couple days things normalize. Thats beyond obvious point. (whatever, word ""massive' seems dishonest)

If look graph, insane. *literally* looks like cliff. Obviously, can't keep up, much ""massive"". ‚ÄúBoth uncontrolled observational studies limited small sample size.‚Äù make patent public, since nobody replicate it. shouldnt much power. dont want teach person clearly don;'t care students. source use 
 
It shows day last week, 9246 new cases. fully updated yet, site (which worldometers uses source), says already 9571 cases reported today. that's 325 week ago. one across board media fueled panic people accepted risks went jobs / lives without pay extra overhead ""safety"" (if even makes difference proven). simply hard prove employers fault caught cold. sure hope vaccination trick soon chance covid stick longer us. Covid already developed kind escape mutation called ""E484K"" swaped negatively charged amino acid positively charged one. way antibodies less effective.

Three recently detected SARS-CoV-2 lineages (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1), unusually divergent possesses unique constellation mutations potential biological importance. these, two circulating Brazil (B.1.1.7 P.1) one (P.1) detected Manaus Jan 12, 2021.

One case SARS-CoV-2 reinfection associated P.1 lineage Manaus accrued ten unique spike protein mutations, including E484K N501K.Moreover, newly classified P.2 lineage (sublineage B.1.128 independently accrued spike E484K mutation) detected several locations Brazil, including Manaus.P.2 variants E484K mutation detected two people reinfected SARS-CoV-2 Brazil, in-vitro evidence presence E484K mutation reduces neutralisation polyclonal antibodies convalescent lot evolutionary selection pressure vaccines immunity general virus pressured set escape mutations.

""**How explain rapid evolution?**

It may indicate increasing persistent selection pressure. example, increasing degree immunity population favours virus variants partially escape body‚Äôs defences.

**Under conditions selection pressure arise?**

It occur level individual population. example, individuals weakened immune systems, cannot effectively fight virus effectively, pathogen ‚Äútry out‚Äù new things longer period time. end, variants effectively escape body‚Äôs defences remain.

Regions first wave pandemic particularly strong ‚Äì parts South America South Africa ‚Äì also exert strong selection pressure many people developed immunity following Sars-CoV-2 infection. New virus variants may advantage here.

In South Africa Brazil, researchers closely following development virus. remarkable variants therefore discovered studied early on. places, may similar variants don‚Äôt know sure covid future. Coronaviruses general much likely mutate compared smallpox example could vaccinate everyone easily beat disease. race updating vaccines escape mutations virus.

Let's see.

The vaccine produced faster administered US. faster get job done faster rest world get access vaccine. 

Your plan slows reality. vaccine ALREADY stolen poorer countries. faster roll complete faster countries get access it. simply reality. Slowing slows there.

And moot anyway cause [CDC still recommends get even deny nothing Covid. real disease, quite contagious, you‚Äôre elderly infirm poses serious risks. you‚Äôre young healthy, kid, doesn‚Äôt pose much risk. higher risk 0, less many low risks we‚Äôve tolerated, like driving contagious diseases. nuts? [**This talks trial people **NOT** vaccinated infected covid! Read fucking article! would recommend reading types articles skeptical eye. say ""article"" actually ""studies"" often opinion pieces anecdotes.

For example one article cited evidence fact cases ""did seem spike"" BLM protests ""people seemed wearing masks"". kind science based conclusion someone spitballing.

There numerous studies measure far droplets fly long remain suspended air stuff like that. lab setting, real world, misses key question whether particles actually infect someone. evidence masks working? personally think opinions vary.

[Another time frame 10-20 days. think people thinking terms months.

The problem real study would need compare two similar cities/states/countries every way besides lockdown policy thing exist. virus expand uniformly comparing example California late outbreak Texas early outbreak apples oranges.

In lieu people try post-hoc statistical analysis easy either. early studies really really want know answer something mean found it. think studies simply inconclusive. court public opinion obviously decided anyway. that's case try get RNA vaccines available autumn also updated common varients too. Hoping best works ok you. fact, no. vaccines reduce transmissions, don't. That's uncertainty whether COVID vaccines would reduce transmission. Luckily we're seeing evidence pretty effective reducing it. want believe, I've seen said eye storm. guess I'm ready declare victory, fear lead debilitating depression cases start going back due variants. know.

I'm serious. know. Sifting countries data, somewhat difficult, I'm sure guidelines.

I say, seasonality appears play huge roll. Minus India, slopes happened around time World Health Organization clarified CT levels lowered constitute positive. 

I'm sure major factors not.

I asked virus 'die out' seems unlikely, although impossible either. I'm Oregon. in-classroom school shit right now. kid wants, keep zooming home.  special treatments going get? special medicine available others? Alternatively, might young healthy... Military, guess, full people severe chronic illnesses. downvote take.

Chicken pox Polio generally diseases found children majority people immunity (because young),

Covid hand clean slate, 100% population spread through. means spread cluster stop, continue spread, get huge swaths people Covid, hospitals get overrun, etc.

Plus covid tends kill large portion elderly people catch it. Polio led paralysis something like 0.5% cases, chicken pox deadly adults 0.03% mortality rate (most people get kids less deadly), Covid kills something like 5%+ 70+ year olds.

Add fact 70 years advanced polio going around think useful say ""we survived polio deal Covid"". different things, attacking different parts population, different forecast get vaccinated.  Lab ‚ÄúAccident‚Äù  Yes. personal solace, resemble overall patterns Spanish Flu.

Indicates ""3rd wave"" could come first second waves disappear. I've read give modified version virus virtually zero chance giving bad case. usual risk factors age group ( high) reduced even further. ......what? know you‚Äôre one facilitating this, wow concept blows mind. imagine sick wouldn‚Äôt reason miss virtual school. mental health effects crushing loneliness might kids skipping day two. know because...? Teachers are, exceptions, teaching behind plexiglass. Generally, us face face feel compelled walk around check students. really can't see they're writing 6 feet away. No, countless people saying would ""post holiday spike"", ""third wave"", variants would cause new spread, etc. Nobody predicted new cases hospitalizations would drop 50%+ January February. World asks export ban EU. see vaccination nationalism practice Crazyyyyyyyyy it‚Äôs reported people become sick before. 

You know don‚Äôt expect people say things doesn‚Äôt make sense? Yeah one times. didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see comment like yours. always risk individual. teachers policy risk population. 

A teacher infected, either school outside may possibly infect kids, families kids. 

It's reducing r0 overall, nessecarily mortality individual teachers. Classrooms potential super spreader epicenters. So, good idea vaccinate teachers (who eligible vaccine kids not). would ask headache *child* though, schools. Ive seeing people talk experiences getting 2nd dose vaccine.... it‚Äôs actually pretty terrifying off-putting. state sue Cuomo people know getting shots elderly work health care. I'm 30's appointment March asthma makes eligible NY now.  I'm Medford opinion combination widespread immunity (estimated 30-35% nationwide probably higher certain areas), cold weather keeping people inside, vaccinations, decreased testing probably lot higher holidays.

People forget lot cases found testing. testing means cases, less testing means less cases. lot people got tested around holidays traveling, likely stopped. They're also ethnicities. racist ethnicities. example, Jews also race, think anyone disagrees Hitler racist towards Jews. teachers greater risk bad outcome getting covid, give vaccines currently short supply need literally stay alive. 90% covid deaths people 50+. makes sense give vaccines teachers strong union. 3 kids get letter almost every year. kids go school stay they're sick. Sometimes send note, sometimes don't. Puleez let get called court. would fun day judge. Yeah, that's even remotely wasn‚Äôt dangerous pandemic. :eyeroll: Exactly. people consider maybe pediatricians weighing experts children‚Äôs health? kids go k-12 perfect attendance drawing win car here. joke, got it. super duper smart sees past secular world view. see like futile problem southern states US continually sticking abstinence education comes sex. fucking work basic biological drive. Human human interaction arguably level. Biden it, he's strike balance state vs federal rights. 

When Trump says could tell states administer vaccines, issue guidance, poor vaccine distribution. Let alone vaccinating 1 million people per day Joe assumed office. sounds auth-some Pfizer Moderna vaccines actually 90%+ effective 2 weeks... 50% often quoted actually includes ~12-14 days become effective. one explanation. know, people use common sense say oh must off-season. would take special breed concern-troll suggest Dodger Stadium would remain open vaccines Opening Day. Schools much transmission list, remote learning sucks. always nervous I'd get caught using inappropriately lose job time abuse. likely see another peak result super bowl.

Doubtful. People went Super Bowl parties people continued see people anyway. Virtually one mostly stayed home 10 months decided first foray going watch game friend's house. sounds like believe anything long fits narrative. love uneducated. honestly believe personally fever, worthy measurement? entire world view condensed direct experiences? One professors bitching people bitching ‚Äúslow rollout‚Äù day. steaming mad (normally level headed guy) talking people don‚Äôt understand logistical distributional challenge is, he‚Äôs right.

I mean we‚Äôre hitting 3 million vaccinated day yet doesn‚Äôt mean haven‚Äôt pretty damn successful getting shots arms (one highest rates vaccinated people per capita far) Israel interesting leading indicator effect vaccinations they're far ahead everyone else, vaccinated 50% population. falling hospitalizations exactly upstate NY cancelled appts Tues due looming storm. Damn, old man winter dick! Yes. Americans shocked - US unpopular? check US gives shit Canada, Mexico, UK EU. 

And later ask us help. Pfff always took sick days end year. Old sick people die covid. Younger healthier people get covid sick week get better. prioritizing health care workers viral load subjected high. vaccinate people 50+ age increased risk bad outcome get covid. course, teachers sick old get vaccine. cut line take vaccines need protection. teachers good union using advantage. COVID R naught value 2-2.5 meaning every person infects 2.

When coupled facemasks, reduced 1.3.

When considering 30% population infected, R0 reduced 30% 1 meaning die without vaccinations isolation parents can‚Äôt afford time 1 5 live food insecure household. got point there, may misunderstood, apparently human nature going kill us hope once. Ok, let widows know that. timeline off, big peak round holidays cases going quickly.

There really need fear monger misrepresent proposals.  support everyone getting $1,400 mean ""give shit"". course everyone wants $1,400. Hell, Warren Buffet would happily take $1,400. Everyone would happily take $10,000, million dollars. decide good reason it, otherwise economy collapse. unemployment rate show need third stimulus? economic growth show need third stimulus? data actually quite promising right now. 

You want another $1,400. need get COVID? Me, I've employed right through. paid bills. Obviously would take money offered sure *need* it. far people boat - employment consistent, bills getting paid. Maybe makes sense people *that truly harmed COVID* rather using excuse government welfare. 

In case, polite civil always style. hope they‚Äôve kept tabs her. People immune suppressants found mutation factories covid. Convalescent plasma also contributes mutation. It‚Äôd worthwhile see still anywhere figure subsequent mutations long infectious for. US numbers started dropping many areas holidays continued dropping after. spikes around country holidays many predicted. right free speech better analogy, however rather purists view qualifies. disagree view scientific method means admittance proved wrong, constitutes 'proved' wrong often questionable. example, look debate whether eggs good bad? science back either side, similarly using artificial sweetners. Thngs black white make seem. 

Also, see basis say Nazi care science outcome....what political party era ever cared technicalities? think 60s, US Gov time really cared science behind going moon..or getting moon. That's really low hanging fruit mate. 

Again, scientist criticised X scientist's rocket design...then would progress. Upgrades usually borne criticisms. 

You would western-centric think every government drink freedom koolaid value science... think simplest explanation I'm sure verify it. think world ever seen highly contagious virus spread unchecked year. like chain letters Ponzi schemes, unchecked exponential growth eventually run people.

There estimates 30-35% US population infected (about 4-5x many infections cases) probably higher certain areas population centers places frequented young people. 50% alone would significantly slow spread. also possible people natural immunity. virus can't spread forever eventually slow might happening.  Right. Things fell last summer.  threshold. summer. infect someone disease...

Heart disease Covid = bad time unlikely would cause get it. need quarantine get tested, infection come seemingly blue. ""close contacts"" anyone except one person got infected, gave infection person later, know contract them. random droplet probably ended right place right time infect got it.

Even get it, can't sure maintenance guy something else. really covid theatre. also potentially spread virus more. People using fever bar whether covid not. husband currently covid. Neither one us fever. all. tested 2 days symptoms started likely highly contagious test rapid test positive felt mostly fine. reason got tested lost sense smell. Yeah also proposed ""next two weeks important, we'll alright soon"" starting roughly 50 weeks ago. give decision-making overly specialised ""experts"" might end problem bigger covid imho people it‚Äôs mild flu.

I run admittedly small circle, circle, gotten all, 2/3rds bad. ages 27 55, lasting effects. One died.

Now flu vary wildly, time get flu month fatigue wheezing. fact, usually done within 2-3 days. people phrase put away, really know, likely age groups, LOT people, way worse flu they've ever had. Probably, states pretty much using supply sent is. Covid always around, vaccines strongly protective severe illness, even variants. vulnerable vaccinated death rate lower flu. Then, manage way flu (basic hygiene, maybe booster shots significant mutations). wold expect differently someone thinking terms ‚Äúproducing offspring‚Äù. seems like parenting becoming one scientific/rational/legal/economic areas life ... it‚Äôs brave new world don‚Äôt think so, start vulnerable younger people soon, even less so.   I‚Äôm sure people expecting CDC this. Yes, virus running rampant community, probably keep schools closed. would CDC, Center Disease Control, say anything else? would administration disagree experts‚Äô guidance?

It‚Äôs back normal, boring, predictable, policy. Thank God. continue pace we're (which won't, multiple vaccines awaiting approval increasing supply / administration capacity), we'd reach herd immunity October. make sense assume 2021 wash. Nate Silver win... agreed drop puzzling. Could we're reaching herd immunity faster thought, people planned. still antibody testing dialysis patients studied summer, showing huge mismatch confirmed infections antibody seroconversion. Even accounting false positives antibody screening due reactivity non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, suggests much wider penetration general population.

After pandemic mostly over, interesting see data analysis. current trend really due amount herd immunity, numbers continue fall, toss vaccinations well. Lion King fan love music reference, Israel. UK. 400 million German government addition EU funds pre-financing Biontech/Pfizer vaccine.

It's possible compare EU vaccine funding US vaccine funding EU figures include 27 governments spent national level. Germany alone spent 1 billion vaccine development.

It's good turning national pissing contest. EU approach count international cooperation correct long US UK turn vaccine nationalism. Biontech got sufficient funds public private sources develop vaccine. think got backward. said ""imagine treated food like that"" meant imagine gave expired food away instead throwing away (which clearly agree grocery stores do) Russia good sponsor. funny news! asked non-American know much healthcare syatem. Turkey universal healthcare. 

My point is, real treatment covid, get generic cheap supportive (not curing) medicines. difference might happen admitted ICU case critical illness, low probability young adults healthy enough serve soldiers (hard imagine hypertension, late-stage cancer, severe obesity etc) depends area, one answer. example, Gillette Stadium used announcement, nothing changed here. 29 stadiums answers. prepared Trump rich assholes whatever want poor lower middle class toil jobs subservient dick bosses dumb polices? 

My point education system part (there always exceptions course) cranking workers supply rich powerful labor force need buy 10th yacht. think ‚Äúhalf population‚Äù pretty extreme hyperbole. people talking believe scientists know virus real, feel medical community overly cautious. incredibly poor communication regarding reasonings precautions quickly devolved ‚Äúyou must want kill grandma.‚Äù right definitely unreasonable, left ‚Äî especially left leaning media ‚Äî helped fear mongering name calling. parents college professors heavily prioritized education. allowed miss school unless ill point throwing up. Lipids US myth. myth lipids UK. 

Probably block American company owning anything Europe. think? especially bad New York first started happening nobody knew anything virus, testing treatments, nobody knew spread etc. sense states learned Cuomo first states really saw outbreaks severity. NYC also particularly vulnerable population density.

Another part problem Cuomo outspoken confrontational, tends blame everyone else whatever happens, literally wrote book handle pandemic based experience thinks awesome many people think not, published book pandemic still full swing, etc. invites criticism sides. millennials boomers? fine. know plenty people gotten vaccine. best friends mom got month half ago cause works health care, hasn‚Äôt grown scales started buying mass amounts microsoft products. think everyone fine. suspect society somewhat divided people extremely unlikely catch (i.e.: working home, avoiding social events, minimizing time grocery stores always wearing masks, etc) people likely. second group cases effective immunity far higher national average. 

If 10% US confirmed cases say 20% actually caught it, ~ half people actually put risk, like 40% group may already caught it. Certainly anecdotally hear entire families companies it, groups people among nobody has. Teachers simply want show year. They're stonewalling time up. Vaccinate different group instead. initially gave benefit doubt, more. winter/holiday effect literally everyone predicted it.... Like said lockdowns little stop people seeing times. Cases continue go forever socializing drops. Combined decent level immunity many places, even periodic lockdowns (UK etc) course pockets. many areas well control. *Plenty people want criticize them, willing step plate job*

Many parents pulled kids school switched home tutoring pandemic over, step up. think could come useaboe definition ""everywhere"" data reported feeling schools open bad

Quite contrary. think schools closed single day. teachers scared teach either quit stay home. parents afraid of/for kids homeschool them. Schools remained 100% open entire duration pandemic, regardless many old people got sick died. please seek help crippling health anxiety really see generalization occurring media threads like this? talking about? vaccines- test animals last year. viral dose takes infected humans- going WAY different takes infected animals. Wisconsin virtual schooling since May/June last year. least area actual full scale lockdown consisting closing non-essential businesses restricting people homes, providing everyone aid needed make possible. 

And thought possible Republican governed America? Congress spent year deliberating whether people continue receiving financial aid middle national health unemployment crisis? theory one set people practically stayed home entire time. Another set people hygienic, still way. third set people reckless behavior.  
 
If third set drove case numbers stands reason now, within pod, virus spreading well among them. dangerous set people effectively taken infectious registration, overall rate plummeting. Forget US messed restrictions state wildly different. Look world whole. Cases bottoming regardless measures lockdown. prior mass vaccinations. Summer peak serious side hottest spots spring peak. stop. Teachers working home absolutely put ahead risk people people go work. fine, don‚Äôt try open schools mean time.

Why grocery stores open then? no, they're essential - could forbid in-person shopping require delivery/outside pickup. lupus news moderna vs variants? could used similar study using unvaccinated volunteers vs volunteers vaccinated one trial vaccines compared outcomes. would approved vaccine required. 

Your control group unvaccinated individuals.

In first trial exposing unvaccinated individuals covid vaccinated individuals. Sell you?

I mean, guess buy travel vaccines pharmacies, that's hardly thing.  Biden Harris puzzlingly pushing heavily reopening schools people wondering means teachers vaccinated forced return Open what? Pretty much everything open except large events full capacity even always happening places. fully dem admin. wrong, know. Need give benefit doubt everything, spin everything GOOD.

Good find :) Except fact vaccines last April anti-science types interested getting vaccine. pose risk

That's citation needed, schools *can* spread disease, kids teachers school better protected.

In fact, [the opposite seems case] Spoiler: dont Came say that. Covid fine. five months spent bed killer.

I love 90% work meetings, total bullshit nonsense meetings discuss things could hashed email group message thread... miss in-person actually important meetings, though, like weekly team meetings training sessions. There's lot valuable crosstalk gets cut virtual meeting. get point everyone wants vaccine opportunity get one build immune response it, largely stop caring.

A recent survey US Census Bureau says amongst population yet receive vaccine [51% said they'd definitely get 26% said they'd probably get contrasts 14% said probably 10% said they'd definitely (mind rounding errors).

Factor people want vaccine probably ones likely flaunted safety restrictions...and we're probably herd immunity every one wants vaccine gets fully vaccinated, anyway. Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.

Let's say flu deaths around \~150 deaths/day. That's around 55k/year higher years.

At rate we're going, might hit sometime end March. open everything then? majority Americans still vaccinated? 


In theoretical, thing keeping deaths ""flu level"" combination vaccinations course covid restrictions. toss restrictions scale swings longer ""flu level"" anymore. 


Does make sense? 2/10, probably fine.  vaccines could used small scale trials since March using healthy volunteers sample size 100 would enough validate effectiveness vaccine, willing allow volunteers take risks testing process many lives could saved least get haircut March :D think they're both, one other, vaccine trials part approved yet.

Here's slightly different take it, job ad Imperial College recruiting researcher work project: 
 looking highly motivated Research Associate work innovative SARS-CoV-2 human infection challenge study. enable investigation COVID-19 pathogenesis protection well permitting follow-on vaccine efficacy studies.

Again, definitive, vaccine efficacy studies follow on, suggests initial studies vaccine efficacy studies. still 100% mean they're unvaccinated participants.

But I'm pretty convinced. That's works. Ha literally read Cleveland Clinic article total coincidence today! referred ""COVID arm"": Apparently big deal, although gets worse keeps bothering days, might well call doctor ask.

No, talking ass.

I also read article gave exact description. Curious where. I've got family larger ""cities"" (agreed, they're small) one weeks due direct contact another student tested positive, none schools closed. They've also still got sports extracurriculars going on, classes. least, would think would equivalent whatever Wisconsin open schools fall. true, really interesting observation, too. Okay, even could prove China unquestionably ‚Äúdid it,‚Äù sanctions would sufficient? sanctions caused real economic pain China would also inflict massive pain ourselves, due interconnected economies are. even accept premise China totally responsible virus, demanding reparations comparable economic costs virus could easily escalate war. point that, Chinese complicity virus proven, must choose war nothing ‚Äî it‚Äôs possible response would either ineffective, otherwise futile self-harming. greatly reduce transmission? Lmao criticize everyone. I‚Äôm pretty liberal it‚Äôs like spared Trump anyone matter anything Human Challenge study, first phase research aims establish smallest amount virus needed cause infection. Scientists expect take two completed ‚Äì depending outcomes ‚Äì additional volunteers recruited, vaccinated exposed virus help identify effective jabs accelerate development. Approval part study yet granted.

The purpose trial facilitate vaccine testing. Which, OP said, much higher priority start pandemic (edit: first batch Moderna vaccine Feb. 7, 2020).

Thank God get November/December 2020 find Phase 3 vaccines worked. took huge risk choosing vaccines produce direct evidence efficacy. HCTs would avoided risk.  they‚Äôre start paying teachers money. False science clickbait sells ads. also scares shit people soon second dose takes hold, i‚Äôm long CDC guidelines reopening (masking, distancing, etc.) place. boomers specifically - certain half political spectrum mostly. going ignore deaths 2.42 million worldwide? i‚Äôll take chances vaccine.
i wonder got 900+ statistic. This. feel like see headline like every days.

Yeah, that's problem study going biased towards know.

Haven‚Äôt saying get vaccine even you‚Äôd recovered covid? think say you‚Äôve 90 days, safe advisable get vaccine. 

I agree young healthy people hang back higher risk get vaccinated. covid already, already protected never hang back too. haven‚Äôt hearing messaging. seen single positive comment AZ vaccine

I've heard elementary schools okay maybe middle school April May, nothing high school. second year prom graduation. Oh, obesity factor increases risk 50%. age increases tens thousands times. obese 20 year old 50% higher risk fit 20 year old, fit 20 year old near 0 risk, obese 20 year old still thousands times less risk 85 year old nursing home patient. getting pretty toxic around here. There's lot uncivil, often simply stupid, responses intelligent observations like yours. Something's wind. Yes, like idea using Zoom extended catch-ups friends live side country instead phone call Facetime. I've found conversation setting much better. 

But think that's pretty much it. intend virtual events definitely post-vaccine. True. another reason need better paid leave US.

Although honest would bit difficult since lead pretty active lifestyle. That‚Äôs great hear! mean, literally raided house doctor saying bad Florida, wouldn‚Äôt exactly trust numbers. Instead breaking job various categories they‚Äôre using, would made sense randomize somehow? lottery system sort? 

It seems like perfect system, would closest perfect number shots have? goal widest prevention spread. committed 

Best effort != commitment.  really edit original response, guests want see kid wear mask come house right now. wear masks around house it‚Äôs 3 us. open changing get spring/summer information everything. think we're really seeing effects vaccinations yet two reasons.

- lag little longer might think to: getting noticeable percentages people vaccinated waiting efficacy kick (a couple weeks 50%, month 90%+) waiting efficacy show stats (a couple weeks - people getting virus today due immunity show case stats two weeks hospitalizations two weeks that)

- ratios yet changing. Cases fell first, starting weeks ago many vaccinated, followed falling hospitalizations falling deaths. Since prioritizing elderly/vulnerable, really see effects vaccines hospitalizations deaths fall *more* relative cases, response it, still spreading way smaller proportion people getting severely ill it.

This *starting* show stats.

For example, Ohio started vaccination nearly 60% 80+ ... based lag times probably 40% immunity .. hospitalization stats updating *today* probably reflective getting infected couple weeks prior around 20% immunity. Still, even starting see effect. New hospitalizations falling age group (as cases decline every age group), falling *faster* 80%+ group (ex. 36% compared previous week, relative ~20% lower age brackets)

These eye-popping differences, driving overall picture. yet - accelerating quickly soon. means things get *even better* already, fully agree optimism. coming end soon. Usually try understanding others opinions, becomes really hard online school. People don‚Äôt realize much online school SUCKS students, probably teachers don‚Äôt know. lot people issues school, don‚Äôt enjoy it, that‚Äôs understandable. doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs value school. basically anyone 18, social life daily routine revolve around school. Sure, it‚Äôs different everyone, even someone doesn‚Äôt really hang people weekends, still get lot interaction friends school building full time provides lot meaning. extracurriculars, sports, music arts programs, classes, simple experience study hall friends, food provided poorer children, childcare provided kids busy parents-it‚Äôs super essential. teachers essential workers, need complete duty. middle high schools, good amount issues. can‚Äôt solve unless go back form schooling that‚Äôs much better kids health. want kids wear masks, fine, see harmful deal that. want kid, yes even high schoolers, deal online school taking away huge amount livelihood obviously don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking about. course vulnerable children consider differently, vulnerable children pretty far between. Maybe said something wrong don‚Äôt know stupid closures things, schools offensive. lol, sounds like figured operate much less overall budget going towards teachers. Virtual school stay, teachers handle double class size Florida's declining case counts = wipe paper brown changed opinion one increasingly disregards science increasingly endangers community country spending better part year excoriating people exactly that, throwing fits relatively obvious comparison identification rank hypocrisy. Selfish scornworthy. Irish British/English races. They‚Äôre nationalities. Therefore, cannot racism. xenophobia, prejudice, hatred equally bad.  WSJ article 26k cases 0 hospitalizations. recall ended hospitalizations count grew close 100k, isn‚Äôt 0, 0 26k cases. can‚Äôt recall later articles larger counts hospitalizations, one show trend tens thousands young people testing positive almost hospitalizations weird study. 


This purely mechanical study - young skinnies produce x droplets old fatties produce 1000x droplets. Great. show means higher spread. 


If virus airborne, droplets largely meaningless. Floating droplet transmission airborne transmission different. Airborne transmission basically 'virus dust enough spread' droplet transmission requires droplets. 


There good evidence airborne transmission dominates - supported mere existence super spreaders. case study pointing finger old fatties without much support. 


TL;DR - study accuses old fatties superspreaders droplets - show assert droplets primary mode transmission. Well, I've noticed users follow OP thread thread harass shadow-banned, there's that. nope health issues fail see harmful. hurting, psyche?

Tbf, think overreaction, somewhat ridiculous hypervigilant, affect anyone themselves. Surprise Yeah, members CCP team investigating, hard figure is. What‚Äôs context behind news? CDC prioritized teachers phase 1b California teachers 1b too. bunch states ignoring recommendation? context places haven‚Äôt gotten phase yet? People care ""experts"" say policy decisions driven experts leave worse financial situation before. simple that.

I really think people sum others' antipathy toward lockdown centered around inability get haircut frappucino really revealing place relative privilege whole era lives. Literally fake quote someone paraphrasing. Note single, double quotes. Here's real one. pretty clear dichotomy get checks/don't get checks. Stop political disinformation.

""If send John Reverend Washington, $2,000 checks go door, restoring hope decency honor many people struggling right now. send senators Perdue Loeffler back Washington, checks never get there."" think anyone listen public health officials this. Public trust long gone. give strain modified weaker. one felt ill all. bit weak, probably due allowed exercise take blood 5 times day.

You literally sat chair days end. Even take long bathroom they'll knock door case erm... raising heartbeat.

Still, take books laptop etc give PlayStation games plus movies.

Great student want couple weeks study. Better ventilation ensuring distancing seem like outlandish demands. got second dose couple weeks ago, still wear mask stores problem it. Even though it‚Äôs pretty much certain vaccines reduce transmission, people store don‚Äôt know vaccinated isn‚Äôt.  Teachers great risk getting seriously ill. Imagine grocery workers attitude. Yes! see huge risk hanging vaccinated people hanging around kids specially. Kids almost get infected all, people risk already vaccinated works ways. Lol ok mantra next two years, re: democrats:

If wanted to, would. Also, many parents one watch sick kid. Lots jobs, get fired calling sick. Sick kids sent school desperate parents need work. desperate underpaid, underpaid due policy makers value healthcare poor. actually tidy system wealthy rely upon labor poor stay wealthy. EU lot so-called experts. 

The role experts say boss wants(Merkel own, pocket experts every stupid idea wants implement). experts knowledge experience, would say, worse average redditor has. 

Usually, boss know say, bosses smart - EU tradition, experts generate random pieces wisdom, like ""traditional vaccine good deal"", ""mRNA bad deal"", ""we die"". Usually TV. Sometimes newspapers. non-believers prove ... let‚Äôs see strongly really feel doesn‚Äôt exist can't believe US actually something better Europe. Hey, thanks work lazy ass! guess wonder 70k deaths indeed addition normally occurring deaths, degree 70k deaths replacing deaths would normally happen. somewhere middle, think stands reason say 70k completely addition expected deaths age group independent investigation.

Is even past precedent action? Also ""independent"" probably meant US-led (and know that'd go...)  struggling find reason believe virus different

Well, is. would figure corporations like Subway would think good look someone sneeze fresh food preparing sandwich. need prioritize what's vital survival now. happens grid crashes vaccinated plant operators lineman? without power? Sweden 15th world COVID19 deaths per capita 1200/million. That's 3 times higher next Scandanavian country, Denmark, 12 times higher neighbors, Norway Finland. Nobody want's 401k pension. realize good California public employees (especially law enforcement) think almost unbelievable retirement easy. No, dependent free market vaccine nationalism. stopped wiping groceries back summer evidence came surface transmission significant vector. still disinfect surfaces apartment, that's hygiene versus COVID. Merkel wanted close everything even longer, prime ministers convince open earlier Nah, send ([and even talk shows. favor vaccinating teachers requiring teach person then, wouldn‚Äôt kind dumb vaccinate right summer break? Like aren‚Äôt (as in, getting first doses February March), might well wait August. What‚Äôs really going get done month person school May/June? Social media take brunt this. don‚Äôt think bad, unless insanity continues another year keep moving goalposts forward things like ‚Äúnew strains, can‚Äôt reopen yet‚Äù ‚Äúnow there‚Äôs new novel virus, must remain lockdown.‚Äù

I‚Äôm really, really hoping see another pandemic scale foreseeable future. I‚Äôm hoping use data one better decide lockdown, weigh risks sides. Putting sun weekend seems sensible enough. scientific data prove this, putting 1 1 together. cost-benefit analyses April protestors current CoVID restriction-weary individuals expressed mutual willingness disregard scientific recommendations reach certain level intrusiveness personal plans perspectives. That‚Äôs selfish, scornworthy, typical American political behavior pressure. 

We‚Äôve seen throughout pandemic: people making fun anti-maskers tantrums Wal-Mart mask requirements jut airports force teachers work unsafe environments vaccines dangerously outdated ventilation pandemic them. cost-benefit analysis April protestors decided they‚Äôre ‚Äúdone‚Äù CoVID, preventable deaths Americans ‚Äúcost‚Äù they‚Äôre altogether eager bear. That‚Äôs selfish scornworthy. Punishing attendance often times punishes poor disfunctional families much get kids classroom. That's clear article original source is, least. I'm siding ph1 starting unvaccinated now. bleach.  

The hard thing Ozone *really* bad human health too. So, sure, fill room Ozone, kill ton harmful stuff come plan completely air room since Ozone long half life. Question is, much stuff stay? odd system. No. all.

You grossly trying simplify this. way produces less valuable data, significantly unethical. true. people vocal social media also likely break rules. anecdotes; large 20 +/-10%; central Texas tho.... facebooks typical ""dems pushing socialism stuff"" look Virginia. matter give still complain move goal posts try fight tooth nail come back.

Here 21st century there's almost need listen talking head one wants put forth effort themselves. data always available online somewhere days. C19 doubly so. mean look way educational attaintment. bachelors masters degree, live NYC. one know friend group going work person right now, similar levels education. Im sorry, grocery store worker *of course* going person, simply based fact people without degrees line work.

People love criticize teachers say ""wElL GrOcErY StOrE WoRkErS???"" even makes sense. Im sorry thats truth.

Also person since September NY. Seems like rest world problems keeping open whole time without real consequences. unethical. Millions people dying virus. workplace asked participate study (I work healthcare) would agree it. even pay ultimate price; dying service others righteous death could ever hope for.

Just agree think way, mean unethical. means willing lay life others. aren't. would hope could find obvious flaws studies suggesting smoking safe. would also hope see massive conflict interest tobacco exec saying smoking safe vs pediatricians university researchers saying schools are. What, think I'm part ""big education""? curiosity, need know? I‚Äôm asking argumentative way, genuinely curious. vaccines early 2020.

This done control group group vaccinated volunteers infected trial over.

People would know bothered read headline. B would likely people socially distanced wore masks got vaccine does.

The people fuck above, likely becomes. We're giving virus wayyyyy many opportunities mutate. seems like every epidemiologists biggest concern right now.

We're already point they're planning new vaccines based mutations. That's terrible sign. They're they're confident governments buy it. Governments buying expect mutations potentially devastating economy.

At point admit handling lack containing virus making situation 100X worse. treated way countries strict measures, we'd concerned that.

IMHO biggest concern right India's poor work: mutation emerges that, going potentially big deal. Understandable viewpoint. think unfortunate US Canada close be, one thing clear past decade US see Canada closest ally - position definetly goes United Kingdom. mostly boils Iraq War. Canada ultimately right Winter Olympics 2022, two games one year? Yes. That‚Äôs point vaccines would take hard pass fucking thing. Remember whatever Johnson Johnson makes, need worry 1 dose per person. Though enough singlehandedly end crisis soon, able fill gaps now.  3 year old missed daycare since started. dude could given link. people! one behaves different sentiment seems dying lately (at least hope is). 

You're right though, I'll pretty shocked there's people coming express desire kids perish. Challenge trials done many diseases. understand deciding proceed risky process challenge trials‚Ä¶two months first vaccine candidates approved. thought concluded challenge trials even though would speed vaccine approval. No. political decision. could scientist say level risk government take? interview minefield. 

Just like Joe trying strike balance state vs federal rights. said townhall last night could tell states administer vaccines, issue guidance. - CDC issued guidance necessary, Kamala said yes - would direct conflict CDC said - based science (proper PPE/precautions taken). states like CA closed, others like Texas fully open (minus ice storm closing state). 

I say though, Kamala still trying find footing bit hard watch.

Still - I'd take administration Trump/Pence screw vaccine distribution. Totaly brainwashed know, set Karens seems quite anti-vax anyway. personal experience, older people tend cover mouth cough. know sounds oddly specific, something I've noticed. Children elderly let fly winds.

Also, overweight people tend breathe heavily pretty much time. countries get vaccine given. That's vaccination works. Yup agree. aunt got vaccinated even though late 40s despite fact teaching remote district plans go back year. Selfishly I'm glad safe, think vaccine would better 70 year olds arm. That's kinda point. said quote ""All authoritarian regimes anti-intellectual anti-science"". false. two regimes greatest scientific developments mankind. cannot occur 'anti-intellectual' regime. statement false.  


Whatever philosophical justifications choose create disprove history. I‚Äôve thought beginning. teach private school. entered building even us sign liability forms stating wouldn‚Äôt liable got sick campus. scary itself. Well.. quote: ""scientist explained one main reasons conducting research offers ‚Äúthe fastest way evaluate novel vaccines‚Äù."" ""A Human Challenge study allows vaccinate volunteers infect controlled way virus, compare perhaps new vaccines first-generation vaccines.""

Your quote vague, answered elsewhere article goal challenge gauge efficacy various vaccines (that already know effective, control unvaccinated necessary). Ooo good idea. I'll go get time machine New York?

I'm seeing articles saying NYC teachers get sign January, thousands vaccinations cancelled? Article also January. 
Even every single teacher first shot January, they're immune yet. So... missing? I'd appreciate article asserts claim. 

And finally, OH FREAKING CRAP. WORKING. WORKING BUTTS OFF. They're nannies. think anyone working remotely ""not back work?"" teachers? goes Trump, Biden, Cuomo every ‚Äúlaw order‚Äù official lol wonder who's going take care children daycares. means different set people (daycare workers) get priority getting vaccine, address children old daycares still young left unattended. wasn‚Äôt either side. I‚Äôll take heat it. Yes, Republicans done more. agree. Democrat Governor shutdown work almost year plan knowing fully well divided congress would never agree another stimulus. I‚Äôm fan approach either Yeah I‚Äôm done shit. want live life. want make money job. want able work career spent whole life working hard achieve. part one really likes talk about. fine low wage workers, also real fears anxiety, work throughout pandemic little protection sick time, mention teachers going back worst POS planet would like nothing better see teachers die. Oof. Okay. Also missing point. it. 1 10 women pcos. 4 10 women obese.

So Googled it... read single line. 1 10 women... child bearing age. Ya left second part. poverty mental health issues still able maintain much energy put body vs much energy used

Of course I'm saying ever say can't, would obese. I'm saying obstacle telling people situations ""well eat less exercise more"" exactly helpful. Elderly overweight real superspreaders really exist. Scientists found people produce 1,000 times many aerosol particles peers breathe out, making far greater risk.
The older overweight people were, likely among 20 per cent exhaled 80 per cent aerosol droplets, study almost 200 people showed.
The information could key understanding dynamics pandemic, researchers said. well established Covid-19 driven ‚Äúsuper-spreading‚Äù. people virus infect anyone else, small number people infect many others.
Epidemiologists stress necessarily due person, circumstances. example, meat-packing plants, choir practices churches hosted documented super-spreading events.
As understanding virus developed, scientists concluded transmitted droplets aerosols suspended air. new study, published Proceedings National Academy Sciences, counted aerosol particles people‚Äôs breath found that, well location, differences people may indeed play big role, naturally prone super-spreading.
Aerosols made exhaled air rushes mucus lining airways. ‚ÄúThe surface mucus break like sea breaks strong wind storm,‚Äù said David Edwards, Harvard University. This, sea, sends spray, case spray potentially infectious mucus. Crucially, Edwards thinks, spray dependent characteristics mucus, concentrated people, especially grow older overweight.
‚ÄúThe point commonly made super-spreading environmental phenomenon. clearly that. also clearly biological one,‚Äù said.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve found super-emitters exhale 50,000 particles kids exhale two particles.‚Äù county that? find fascinating know understand little, completely convinced opposite.

The embodiment Dunning-Kruger effect Hi everybody,

I'm sorry questions get asked million times wife tested positive I'm freaking little bit.

She first got symptoms yesterday sort nasal swab morning, came back positive. thinks may contracted Friday fucking tourists job.

What now? 

I'm feeling symptoms, live together, get tested? 

Is high false-positive rate nasal swab?

How prepare get sick? insurance speaking doctor possibility. 

Thanks advance.  pretty hopeful earlier vaccine would openly available everyone June, I'm optimistic. Supply far meeting demand areas still. Missouri, Governor deemed teachers school faculty non-essential one first groups qualify vaccine. Yet, hard-pressed getting students staff back in-person teaching start current school year (and social distancing/mask protocols basically non-existant, especially across rural school districts...which sister teaches). essentially leaving exposed vulnerable shown concern haste getting access. Still cannot believe people voted actual term - worthless. Outdoors though. learned summer fine. Meanwhile school district, perhaps whole county, requiring teachers school workers get vaccinated order resume school activities.

They also almost-nonexistent testing protocol (once every 2 months IIRC), cleanliness/hygiene plan leaves lot desired. Well true, much want bet government still tell us otherwise? doesn‚Äôt matter Oh cool. basically take adhd amplify it. Awesome. Everything makes life worth living stripped away year. It‚Äôs staying home. us wanting ‚Äúlive‚Äù again, rather ‚Äúexist‚Äù. Give vaccine ASAP. Could be, especially Helsinki capital region (including Vantaa main airport located) local people seem much relaxed guidelines elsewhere Finland. I've multiple times I've one wearing mask example kiosk take-away (I've spent part Covid time abroad masks outside home obligatory kind got used use public indoor areas courtesy everyone). smaller places Finland tenth infections related population still see much higher percentage people wearing masks public spaces, recommendation, rule.

Also, lot foreign workers (cleaners, construction workers, etc.) Helsinki area travel back forth, stated news interview come work time funds skip work isolate even get tested case something might show up. New limitations incoming travel need negative test results set lately - even many set plane / ferry operators current legislation allow made obligatory. people realize trials going year now? dumb think December first time anyone got shot new vaccines? Hope Cuomo sees you, bless. Yes understand vaccine. Animal testing limited minimum. get common flu time?  Okay, value statistical life would use economic cost-benefit analysis restrictions why? Overall super happy anyone getting vaccines. I'm this. Especially we've actually made effort seeing anyone entire time. rough Agreed. That's goes governments contractors lot time situations even moreso. would rather oversell deliver undersell deliver. don‚Äôt disagree you.
