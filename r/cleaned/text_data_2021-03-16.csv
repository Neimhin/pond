I want MRNA vaccine. gives best immune response. technology amazing scientifically sound. coverup genuine concern Cue backlash! Thanks service. ""It's perfectly justified continually purposefully undermining vaccine middle global pandemic initial trial data *months ago* confused (but still proved safe)"" 
  

Uh huh. even listen gross morality intense ignorance stupidity spewing?  people would risk people get shot. Heard immunity measure population got shots. person vaccinated another person cannot get serious infection covid think vaccine political genuine concern Cries Canadian.... real good job glad things looking you. tried right thing. called twice cancel prime location appointment. phone lines many calls, force hung times.

I hope need to, case: /s Perfect Peggy screeching 100 mph! Dude pandemic way out, literally living rock since March 14th, 2020?

ETA -- bonus points person would ALWAYS show talk quirky pre-covid microwedding was, 5 people converse sneakers dog ringbearer whatever actually know many people sick Covid? I've working person supposedly one hardest hit US states entire time even know anyone really even asymptomatic case, let alone died. less believe numbers, made realize many people word guess. know many people lives ruined restrictions people affected virus way whatsoever though. Going bank first time year since pandemic started. anxious, TN downward trend vaccinations increasing, know okay. pandemic done number mental health even going inside building anxious going somehow get covid. can't wait get vaccinated start able calmly normal things... ahhh! Wife signed notified spots opened luckily 2 opened 11am morning got first dose.  need get vaccines folks 70's little side effects Moderna vaccine rounds. mild headache slightly sore arm it. first round Moderna vaccine yesterday, soreness arm remained fairly mild already decreasing tonight. slight case nausea, sinus infection right could causation that. sore arm flu shot last year expecting Moderna shot. I'm surprised mild been. Even able sleep arm last night without much issue. States rushing get many vaccinations possible. people going following restrictions much longer. summer travel season starts Memorial Day weekend, every person themselves. states restrictions lifted point anyway. No, like confidence AZ using many different variables. I'm sick apples oranges statistic. Give us efficacy 7 days first dose like second dose. 12 days since that's say protection may start. Anything exclude ramp period happens afterwards care Jesuslord, that's outrageous. new vaccine lmao I‚Äôm confused got 21 downvotes unaware thing, could elaborate? Bmi 30 Chicago teachers Union holding kids hostage. refused go back work covid fears kids failing classes shitty home situations. Meanwhile literally every essential job went back work without vaccines. No, 7 day average double two weeks. know would say have. looking single days, okay, Missouri quadrupled one day last week. extremely strange No. People fucking care....

 becoming hard keep sanity intact here. true. California's metrics terrible. Florida, Utah Texas done better metrics. seems case Ohio. seems age range hits 65-70% slows crawl. US population vaccinated, United States vaccine factories going pumping shitloads vaccines countries order. Vaccine production going towards moon folks post responding insinuated sub overrun people deny covid exists, post stayed.

Anyways stay safe everyone, stay safe last moment always aware surroundings! bigotry, analysis scientific data reducing blood transfusion risk. Everyone risk profile. Saying fair logic anti-maskers use. 20% trust AZ, they're enough take meagre amount AZ-doses delivered :)

In country (Denmark) total amount AZ doses received far amount number Pfizer doses get next week. assuming pretty much EU.

So worried suspension AZ, really care anymore number doses low anyway. meaning criteria Montana? Cause Texas 1c Pretty bummed Moderna weekly allocations stagnated past 6 weeks. never expected much J&amp;J.

Pfizer miss end-of March target, least they've ramping significantly week week.

I want over... think double dipping fully tested suggest it. seem worth risk since Pfizer already 95% effective. checked website fall river 10 miles nearest mass vaccination site like half vaccines sent really surprise me. Walking pace self reported. heck actually knows sure walk 2.8 mph vs 3.3 mph? Ohio beating PAs ass getting vacc out. Pretty sad. I‚Äôm really optimistic potential Novavax - it‚Äôs going HUGE part getting developing world vaccinated. Dude, anxiety on-off switch. Ha state big FWIW  slow walker feel deck perpetually stacked us, higher risk heart issues 4x mortality Covid? like take time breathe in? doctor not. Reddit hive mind thought. entire history virology, never significant chance reinfection that‚Äôs viruses functioning immune system work. date still don‚Äôt even blood test confirmation handful reported reinfection cases actually reinfections. don‚Äôt know getting downvoted, agree. europe ""actively"" distributing world.

Europeans get stay locked forever go vaccine world. Good them? Hmm. ass, study walking speed/covid connection? walk like shit 10k, regularly. many obese family members friends have?  got mine today drive 3 hours get it. Props CVS quite quickly. Imagine shhh'd roller coaster Honestly hats Dewine. family mostly liberal, mom liberal all.... even said she‚Äôs support dewine well he‚Äôs done COVID. pro science pro health, maybe perfect given conservative population managed well Also ""just elope!""

Lol, work courts closed can't travel. Reddit disproportionately young, male, probably unmarried safely ignore say weddings.  Starting lose hope 2021. Vaccination state seems going slowly, lot people know states already got theirs. feel like restrictions careful states going stick around form another year. tired this. Got first Pfizer today too! can't assert perfectly safe 0 reason blood clots perfectly healthy people getting sick taking it... pretentiousness white collar WFH crowd never jobs threatened.

God hate crowd. ""It's easy lockdown! stay home teehee hard!"" Patient samples usually sequenced, sequencing issue. appears part virus PCRs target mutated tests recognizing it. little information moment issue related viral load. post purely political post lol. fear many feel every time pandemic going forward.

Or there's bad flu season.

I'm really concerned there's going mask mandates rolling seasonal basis depending particularly bad flu strain. Yea, actually imagine is, trying knock much. people think tourist destination.

Probably check vaccinated anyway. I've vaccinated pfizer vaccine, &amp; starts get people getting vaccinated doses expiring, reason also get J&amp;J, Moderna vaccine? Would extra immune? NYCer, hated slow-walkers... now, id anything precious slugs back Big Apple. used worms me; dwelling within heart memory, long return. would hope anti mask anti vax sentiment strong US growing Canada. understand people voting first comment. People choice whether want vaccine not, good all, especially travelling many highly dangerous variants loose, come time prove vaccinated.
It's already thing. getting screened mall, tell screeners vaccinated am. let without full screening questions temperature checks. Anecdotal know still can‚Äôt taste smell since diagnosed January. don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs considered ‚Äúlong haul‚Äù it‚Äôs certainly disturbing end. I‚Äôm Israeli citizen living US. Fuck, shouldn‚Äôt left cause can‚Äôt get vaccine It‚Äôs beautiful check out. Good. hoping states deciding open set venerable example places follow intrepidity, tired living dejection... rates decrease, vaccines increase, melancholy joviality. one get waitlist. GF immuno-compromised got first shot. I'd like get mine soon reduce potential vectors transmission. countries played wait see game, covid took risks feel like need 3-4 million day administered meet new eligibility demands. know much Pfizer Moderna produce day meet March goals.

I feel like getting hopes earlier dates, getting concrete appointment new large group quite difficult. We've destroyed millions lives trying (and failing) save few. Look much avoidable damage we've caused taking drastic measures stop unstoppable virus. Probably regional thing. time ever came across anti-maskers airplanes.  telling supply meet demand demand vaccine?!?!? I'm native, looked it, much pain find info sign going health department PCP/hospital walmart or... finally got walmart hour live tulsa. mom problem got tribe, though, YMMV. trying argue, countries border controls no?

Every country except USA. I'll miss antimasker Covid Karens least, close second. definitely heard people refusing AZ shots missing appointments.

Yeah, 85%. Thanks link. time started look blood samples. now, it‚Äôs perfectly rational avoid taking vaccine might consequences 1 500,000 times, even though means leaving vulnerable virus kills people 1 100 times. France antivax anyway, sure much translates extra distrust AZ vaccine. KN95 mask? started wearing one feels way easier breathe cloth masks. political? Fauci lied herd immunity. Except can‚Äôt eat/drink mask Common misconception sometimes true viruses transmitted patient symptomatic. Viruses transmitted asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic period almost evolutionary pressure become less severe. Covid19 already spreads showing symptoms.

Smallpox around 3,000 years, still killed 50-80% 1970s calendar invented.

Not mention now-widespread variant B.117 higher mortality rate. outbreak start? asymptomatic spread? subzero departure radically different 2 mRna ones hearing going get vaccine infusion, good news. US vaccinated 11% far. Bizarrely Alaska lead 18% March Alaska open aren‚Äôt filling appointments anymore  Lol outside Vietnam countries ‚Äúsolved‚Äù virus? ones locking year? we're need vaccine adults work home. Feeling like I'm inconveniencing everyone I'm friends hang ask wear masks. think underestimating quickly supply ramp Canada. really six month gap, I‚Äôd agree, think mRNA widely distributed Canada beginning within 60 days - I‚Äôm sure first doses available first high risk people. Idk thank fuck used live oklahoma. natives really kind people mostly forgiving happened past. one best friends actually 100% pure native (not legally something weird past). family nice people. little bit native enough consider one.  Yep! don‚Äôt see full effect vaccination without herd immunity, won‚Äôt achieved 70-80% vaccinated iirc Hot take: schools opened first place. Schools massive incubators worth letting spread virus adults. Can't link comments, sub rules, balanced minute. negative 5 first saw them, they're positive now. scroll find it, far.

I know votes reddit matter, signified lack compassion, see lot here. hubbub people make mental health toll lockdowns, sure want hear people affected it. someone disagrees masks make ""virus denier"" straw man. That's gonna cause tension. EU continuing block another country's legal vaccine contract shipments, needed humanitarian reasons, refuses use spurious reasons, really, really bad look. Without knowing specifics, takes time immune system fully implement immunity conferred vaccines, possible (a) vaccines entirely effective preventing hospitalization, (b) people get sick right getting second dose. age highest risk dying risk people shot let's open back up! think lot psychosomatic, much like diseases difficult measure vague symptoms, similar exclusionary diagnosises like chronic fatigue syndrome ""chronic"" Lyme disease. 10-15 doses per 100 people going cut it. flu kills thousands nobody seemed ever give half fuck tank economy, start printing money, make millions unemployed. 44410 

Ack. Ok checked. Looks like riteaid site borked. shows availability 2800 Mahoning Avenue, Youngstown, OH 44509 gives spinning wheel death try select dates/times. Try midnight, find many pharmacies like Walgreens release extra availability then. Fascinating, didn‚Äôt even state gender. really didn‚Äôt read consider meaning post, you?

The point people free time participate Reddit, including myself, live first world countries (US, UK, Australia, EU member nations, etc.) luxury comfortable life, convenient access health care services, ability manage exposure risk COVID. 

The majority Redditors living majority-vaccinated area end summer 2021. It‚Äôs going take LOT longer rest world reach milestone, neighbors community members deal impact. Vaccine choice important part someone‚Äôs response concerns.

I see decision different you‚Äôre resident country limited vaccine supply won‚Äôt able get another option months. US Canada well-equipped many options foreseeable future, pipeline ramping quickly. post question referred Canadian, comments considered perspective. confusing. Every day consists us telling patients know much they‚Äôll get vaccinated. Sometimes even tell us first press release day work.. Yep vaccines safe effective. people know misinformed It‚Äôs crazy soon it‚Äôs available everyone Oklahoma. Got mine morning vaccination center full people 16 70. Confirmed. Tooth Decay killed Mr. Mackey's father. Germany (as weeks ago, people ‚Äî including health workers ‚Äî skipping appointments refusing sign AstraZeneca shot, fear less effective Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, officials say. result, two weeks first delivery 1.45 million doses AstraZeneca vaccine arrived Germany, 270,986 administered, according data collected public health authority, Robert Koch rethink it.

They misinformed. think what‚Äôs spoken indicates large number people getting vaccine eligible. Otherwise, take much longer.   know young healthy people genuinely afraid get vaccine, medical training, they're making rethink too. confused misinformed? knew coming still got me. Oh could it. sure. confusing indeed. should. going risk, judgment deserve it. Risk identified empirically, based collected data. Moral judgments based people‚Äôs biases limited experiences. Using moral judgments make public health decisions barbaric. say depends relationship grandparents. parents helping raise children, see almost every day. die would devastating them. Aha! works too. Lol ""this,"" mean socially distance? Wear masks? county dropped 16. way! Well, number people around fallen sick comparatively mild symptoms linger around two weeks. tested negative, sometimes twice. Nobody however lost sense smell taste, sinus pain, sore throat, light fever, on-off headaches digestive problems (vomits, diarrhea) reported. 

It might well another virus dodging precautions. Please Bolsonaro, please fuck thi- nah kidding, know will. would vaccines useless ? first time. Look foregneirs HIV testing couple years ago. absolutely random foregneirs got tested twice month oh whim. woman went court 7 year battle got something like 30k dollar. Even back idea 'Koreans pure' main driver behind this.

I even starting abiut Koreans treat Indians South east Asians. Complete different chapter. Yes price? know countries like China disgusting dictatorial countries forcefully locked people inside barriers. Also don‚Äôt think take inspiration country committing genocide atm (Uighurs). many times NZ lockdown back &amp; forth now? 

I live Sweden never lockdown thank god covid basically non existent one wear masks lol great free country. ask ours. would make vaccines ineffective ? Parents make decisions kids every day might lasting side effects. weigh risk vs reward. kid might bullied badly school end suicidal, parents still send kids school risl small reward high. 
Same vaccine. Nothing exists without possibility long term side effects, bit currently evidence suggests reward greater risk. assume Vaccinates would useless ? world leaders politicians pushing back vaccine skepticism amid concerns fewer people willing inoculated coronavirus, particularly among Republicans United States, much Europe pauses Oxford-AstraZeneca shot blood-clot Prince Charles, heir throne, Wednesday denounced said lobbied vaccines article British health-care journal, describing shots tools ‚Äúprotect liberate‚Äù society‚Äôs vulnerable president Donald Trump, part, said interview Fox News Tuesday ‚Äúrecommend‚Äù Americans get vaccinated, saying vaccine ‚Äúgreat‚Äù ‚Äúsomething works.‚Äù vaccinated January left office, office reveal news France, Prime Minister Jean Castex said plans vaccinated Oxford-AstraZeneca shot soon government lifts temporary suspension vaccine. ‚ÄúVaccination exit door crisis,‚Äù said interview French TV station Tuesday, Associated Press reported. keep pointing whenever see comparison. would still take approved vaccines like way pushing hospitalization death numbers study.

Ummm, no, that's vaccine works. Vaccine works properly contain pandemic done alongside herd immunity. Yes, medically deemed able vaccinate, vaccinated. that's everyone capable vaccinated needs vaccinated create herd immunity people cannot, therefore able stop widespread mutation virus. 'Low tax rates business friendly climate' (R) definitely making big difference COVID They‚Äôre Pfizer shots 4 weeks apart now. Well, least Walgreens is. Glad one who's noticed big time. sub used be. Damn shame even OG mods co opted  I'm curious arent asking Russia vaccines. one organized decent R&lt;1 program. lockdowns is. Enjoy. Haha lives money aashole! home delivery groceries consumer goods (like amazon) greener efficient provided one delivery made per trip.  amazon deliveries efficient, single door dash order not, unless person makes multiple deliveries quick succession.

That means small businesses never come back healthy degree Amazon become even stronger monopoly.

HAHA thought Doesn‚Äôt Biontech IP? Can‚Äôt tell Pfizer fuck believe hoarding supplies I've diligent keeping inventory. couple extra cases never hurts emergency, plus I'm buying limited supply available. think they'll free AZ Friday within priority groups. Still it'll taken within hours, millions people priority group 1 3 hesitate take it. Ask medical association then... Actually R0, therefore herd immunity, depend human behaviour.

R0 herd immunity lower people carefull. R0 higher people careless, need vaccinations reach effective herd immunity  Hey got sick exact day. think COVID though, always hard time flu. flu jab got cancelled pharmacy unexpectedly ran doses late book another one (I travel), came strong flu around time bed weeks, still feeling exhausted well June 2020. flu even want know COVID would do. mortality rate 2-3x higher, goodbye normal year 2021. severe outcome mild outcomes completely different, definition. Indeed categories COVID reason. 

If person gets mild symptoms reason assume get severe symptoms. 

Simply put evaluate level severe disease.

As fo SA variant less transmissible Kent variant. much likely see spread lineage near future. want populations protected it. 

Or simply put, completely unvaccinated population far greater risk population vaccinated poor immunity one strain.

Also - looks like vaccines issue - know sometimes PCR tests come back negative despite symptoms. patients died, might well advanced phase disease viral replication active anymore. lab/examination error. Let's wait information. Point scale study doesn‚Äôt say anything certain. data required make conclusions ‚Äòno protection mild symptoms‚Äô claims. I'd like see surveys.

If understand science that's you. Wow cool reminds dilemma train could kill one people instead four, change direction train

Username checks üòÇüòÇüòÇ kidding Absolutely AZ vaccine. loud calls Health Minister resign minutes suspension announced. They're opposition political sphere, people would actually realize they'd take honest look German political world right now.  ...we half-baked self-proclaimed (excuse rudeness) experts stating vaccine 10% effective instilling panic. I‚Äôm tell T-cells help protect severe disease. analysis shows 76 87 TCB sites (87%) impacted mutations seen B.1.351. mean? means T-cell response generated AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine highly effective variant. anal swab lol. Severe outcomes closely correlated mild ones. reason think protect severe disease offers protection mild. reminds dilemma train could kill one people instead four, change direction train. IMO, politicians fear bad press cautious enough. responsability many deaths caused virus fighting looks less attributable responsability deaths caused vaccine allowing. forget made everyone switch mandatory brand masks shown effective make bunch money friends industry. Hopefully everyone does! Hand washing good way stop spread ton germs even normal times. EU exported astrazeneca UK, phizer. Nobody died placebo either.

Severe outcomes closely correlated mild outcomes. vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect mild outcomes, reason think protect severe.

As Kent variant - SA reinfect people recovered variants (and IIRC), doesn‚Äôt matter variant dominant - population go one go another one. need Israeli HMO. It‚Äôs like end Plague know you‚Äôre going lose buy bad symptoms once.

This mutation affected sequence can't detect easily fixed looking another unique sequence. Yes, Ercot board appointed Government formula price ""adders"" controls price ""scarcity"" based formula. Yes. We‚Äôll probably hit metric around end April current trajectory, accelerated vaccinations could hit sooner. Astrazeneca vaccine.

Early results show drug combination may significantly reduce risk hospitalization death. would imagine would studies lethality incubation period related comparing different strains SARS-CoV-2. aware any? already extreme outlier terms length incubation period, viral load exist without provoking symptoms

I see. know that. SARS2 closely related yet incubation periods lethality different.

On point, feel like dodge bullet much bigger caliber one took. examples SARS-CoV MERS-CoV, know coronaviruses capable infecting humans much greater fatality rate example SARS-CoV-2 know longer incubation period much easily spread. combination characteristics perfectly imaginable another coronavirus terrifying thought. NYT usually hates UK AZ contracts countries EU problem. said, AZ use usa UK factories purpose, then? probably did, blocked tried EU Get new doc. Ah yes, France Germany really looked said ""You know what? since people die stick Britain, let's again!"". limited study weeks ago Define ""West"". trust country rule law, independent court system open media. Exactly want highly delicate issue like this. What's China going thousands adverse reaction vaccination ? Exactly like lied covid. 

I issue vaccine studied open society works well, that's count.

Chinese trust chinese made cars, rich buy foreign. would trust something like vaccine given ccps behavior last year ? Probably first one tested born mother got vaccine. definition herd immunity, then? Cause countries suck financial help.
Lockdown necessary, politicians need provide people too. second shot J&amp;J would nothing body would kill sight virus delivers it. problems I'm reading far deeper problems caused pandemic. seem systemically-caused pandemically-caused. know live, lockdowns little deaths. That's told.

Rationally, makes sense use vaccine cases highest, would US. expectation actually AstraZeneca reason fatal complication. question see one bad batch, people dieing last 2 weeks mostly young women. question certain demographic vulnerable. expected AZ released risk COVID old people still much higher. young people expect mild COVID, risk fatal complication might lead preferring different vaccine. heard things called vaccinations? moment lockdowns dangerous us, young, lockdown save older generations. soon immune thanks vaccinations expect lockdowns go away too. already sent 9 mil many sent us ? Well, third week hardcore lockdown coming pissed sky high. child basically requires human contact. 

We allowed leave town unless essential shopping trips similar shit

We allowed cross district borders. essential trips like doctor appointment work related allowed. even shopping trips.

Everything fucking hardcore difficulty level now. Made life way live countryside big city 10 minutes car ride away. cant go there. friends? Cant see them. GF? Another district. Cant see her.

Third fucking week. pushing narrative stay homejailed another month.

Fuck shows Texas made right decision wrong reason. Obviously politics instead science opened state back up. (To distract blackout controversy) Yet seeing proof open nation safely quickly.

I expect remaining states atleast open completely (With keeping mask mandates bit longer) end month. Especially evidence vaccine effectiveness grows. base decisions data political theater. Texas‚Äô decision deflect power issues. guess conspiracy theories okay they're left. Reddit report guy false information conspiracy mongering? Use [http://www.vaccinefinder.org/](http://www.vaccinefinder.org/) lets filter vaccine. got Pfizer Santa Clara county 3/9.  Oh no, it‚Äôs Texas. Austin taken court trying keep mask mandate. According [this also Jerusalem Post, 99 fully vaccinated Israelis died (out millions). death prevention also exactly 100% fact believe numbers article 2% fatality among unlucky souls got infected despite fully vaccinated... dying pretty compelling reason followed closely infecting killing others. Yes odds low, considering Texas state mask mandate put place last July so, waiting months everyone wants vaccine get one would made sense. two states deep-rooted rivalry, even ‚Äúwar‚Äù (more border dispute) 150 years ago. rivalry Ohio State UMich significant part culture. drilled ‚Äúhate‚Äù Michigan young age. It‚Äôs good fun. That's headline without story. better source? 

Anyway recollection hyping vaccine rollout approved, try put political pressure FDA. definitely bad thing. interesting see others stack up, believe J&amp;J found zero deaths hospitalizations study using wider age range. use? simply tried scare people, make fear life start another hard lockdown. told us ""Its really three weeks folks, make it! OK!"" 

we two weeks already stepped game ""Nah, stay Easter"" pushing ""Half April, maybe!"" That‚Äôs days delay logistics. old data. PCR reaction needs two primers, mutation either two corresponding regions, reaction less productive may yield inconclusive results. still COVID-19 variant, mutations happen exactly right place temporarily frustrate PCR testing.  went public school growing up, cut non-educational wastes time went, probably would went three days week Yeah whole rugged libertarian westerner thing gets tiresome. 

Death rates third world country‚Äôs level still stupid good themselves. Interesting. little boy caught tummy bug February 2017...wiped entire kindergarten class. 2 weeks later went acute liver failure‚Äî virus unknown. Set immune cascade led bone marrow failure ultimately needed transplant. Happened 5 kids state year. Glad you‚Äôre better. wonder bug... got first dose yesterday! family half vaccinated. Yay! problem people died mostly young women. (Health workers) significant lower risks COVID fatal. might certain demographic AstraZeneca high risk. E.g. mild COVID vs low risk dieing. Yeah, that's I've heard well makes sense me. buddy texted chat group fever 102 several days second shot, today starting feel better. seems ""symptomatic"". wonder drawbacks getting one shot get sick second one anyway. I'm concerned death serious complications, like lung scarring something. confusing I've read lot listen Osterholm every week.

I guess he's contagious though, that. contagious somehow get infected one shot? (Tbh, JJ starting sound ok me. I'm 42, good health.) EU trying develop vaccines failed.

S Wow, considering situation South Africa it‚Äôs unbelievable slow they‚Äôre moving. I‚Äôm shocked unfortunately, wished moved faster. Thanks list! saying makes sense but... 

All family members friends antivax protrump. 

Antimask antivax, protrump, covid deniers. Every single person know one things, three too. 

I put categories, keep finding there. Even better, lot people high contact jobs, high likelihood morbidity mortality. Well allowed tourists leave australia year definitely didn‚Äôt - probably Indonesian filipino mining workers. US/EU maybe... Clearly, country America's size vaccinated first without outbidding much rest world. multiple primers bind anymore sudden, covid-19? Honestly, healthcare workers let go refuse take vaccine violated oath. anyone goes ""but rights"" tirade, example government taking away rights, private entity electing end employment pose legitimate risk population hired protect. Yep, good point. Either way, getting something want get risk lasting months after. I‚Äôm really excited this. I‚Äôm graduate student research assistant wasn‚Äôt eligible vaccine hospital vaccinating I‚Äôm technically direct covid contact, even though PIs meet often. boyfriend pretty terrible asthma too, go occasionally, get pretty nervous, even though I‚Äôm double masked six feet away. It‚Äôll huge relief sign get vaccine 29th. need modify test bit see comment would recommend it, would recommend lot people want get it. lot people voted me, frankly.""

honestly surprising amount self-awareness üëèüèª Aside aforementioned US, Israel also testing variants. Yes sad. doubt unnecessary deaths due large amounts misinformation. remember, lot large population centers (Houston, DFW, Austin ect..) kept mask mandates place form local ordinances. joke, might need fall winter booster shot. I‚Äôm happy y‚Äôall. shot go with? I‚Äôve dealing leftovers Covid year now. Hearing stories like makes feel less nervous would react shot doctor kinda advising it. Ok reals, knew back lying knew wanted masks hospital workers.  It‚Äôs really weird people sub defend CDC time respond hyperbolically cdc whenever schools brought We've trying last year get people mindset understand. honestly longer energy care self-centered attitude. UK decided share, way doctor 8th jab. understand lockdowns necessary also accepting they‚Äôre without harm. It‚Äôs nothing thing. cases fall vaccines increase, need real meaningful discussions weighing risks. Dr ding drooling misinterpret show tests.

Current tests. undetectable, detected current test covid. chairperson virtually every organisation usually smooth talker statistics expert. easy quick safest (blame avoiding individual) answer suspend dispensing evidence assessed. Yeah, build factories late stage trials, develop vaccine. What‚Äôs policy Ohio even Michigan non-residents? know states there‚Äôs need proof ID residence get jabbed.

Both y‚Äôall states 7 hours drive Toronto, timeline end September people 50. It‚Äôs sad shit rollout been. Yes crazy result have.

All silly political short term gain. 

Don‚Äôt vote stupid people power ! got second dose weeks ago. effective new strains? roommate decided go Florida think think he‚Äôs vaccinated check there‚Äôs cars coming cross road? mean, argument suggests you‚Äôd ‚Äúwhy bother really seeing lots things kill you‚Äù. mRNA breakthrough research University Pennsylvania led vaccine. we're still way way behind many states still way limited. california one (if *the*) last state change. outside usa?

Easter, start knocking 15-20% per week again. 25k late April, 10k late May, 5k Mid-June. Could wrong though. Why? multiple PCR primers bind even covid-19? *cries Canadian* 

My age bracket estimated end September Ontario. Maryland still stuck 65+. üôÑ probably best dataset we'll sero. 20% exposed would mean 64,000,000 Americans protection another 33,000,000 completely vaccinated, another 50,000,000 partially vaccinated, almost highest risk groups. almost assuredly normal summer rate. think that's scheduled two weeks given date.

Limitations Observers

Limit observation youth sports (age 18 years under) immediate household members, strict purpose age appropriate supervision. includes observation practice competition. Limit number observers ensure physical distance maintained, reduce potential crowding, maintain indoor outdoor capacity limits.

""...But worry safely!"" can't wait shit stops. Competent leadership. EU invested quite heavily vaccine development. BioNTech instance received numerous European grants.

Ok bud. 

It simple question. seem unwilling give opinion it. Sounds wee bit like know bit ashamed. Right, that's political reasons then... banning would look bad politically carry on. That's entire issue. went convinced France Italy ban too, look bad Germany turns link. Israel paid advertised price order get wanted/needed unlike US went quantity discount. cost AZ vaccine Pfizer, Moderna?

Given days media publishing paid for, seems buzz AZ kind business trick make sure cheap competitor removed. president AIFA said Porta Porta: ""The vaccine caused thrombosis women, perhaps coagulation defects, women take pill. better people it? could let's wait""


 AstraZeneca case continues discussed. suspension vaccine AIFA, verdict EMA expected, set next Thursday order resume, event positive verdict, administration doses. many quarters, Astrazeneca especially Ema lead, reassurances arrived possible correlations suspected deaths thrombosis administration vaccine. words spoken evening Porta Porta Professor Pal√π, president Aifa, make us reflect.

Same many us western Europe. job done murican. sound sincere coming though Health agencies contact one another, especially european level. saw live press conference head AEMPS clearly said reached decision coordination german, italian french regulatory authorities. vaccine causes significant arm pain. Take pain med second dose relax muscle infection. go away 3rd day wanted lockdown cold/ winter (january) nothing want maybe lockdown again. curfew place since OCTOBER 13. I‚Äôm personally new lockdown. 

I think people agree fact lockdown better curfew bc shops don‚Äôt close right finish school/ job (at 6pm). way, go buy stuff night (quickly, course) instead weekend. Plus know Prime Minister said work home many employers don‚Äôt respect rule all. personally know people go work physically even it‚Äôs useful, bc employer asks to. Also public transportation full like packed around 6 I‚Äôm sure doesn‚Äôt help reduce cases. 

Anyways I‚Äôm done Prime minister government‚Äôs half assed measures. can‚Äôt understand last summer almost normal huge lockdown before? reduced cases enough lift measures.  do. Someone told us even top 10 deaths per capita. 11th. efficacy one Pfizer jab one J&amp;J jab. Essentially could considered fully vaccinated one jab Pfizer Meanwhile Los Angeles.... first, Germany want stop, Netherlands announced Sunday would stop, would difficult explain override scientific recommendation PEI take course northern countries. Wait, go covid threads try pick fights? daily life? teenager? lonely individual something? Ah third lockdown? Guess we're something right ;) Oh goody island nation argument.

That one never tried before.

You mean island like......Great Britain? false claim, /r/coronavirus? got kidding me! Anyone gotten sick funny vaccinated, you? I'm currently double exposing taking care mom brother 7 10 days infected. I'm sure I've exposed prior never directly much certainty. Curious next days might like. No, donated, donated back figured many. Stop noble savage bullshit. spoke american reddit today said dunno anyone got covid trying personally take credit island nation‚Äôs performance?

It doesn‚Äôt answer question tho.

You read english, correct? Hey, heres loads vaccinated 65's coming holiday, locals vaccinated, obviously fuck that, cares! Go serve them! never jackson hole you. Astrazeneca vaccine also provide protection mild/asymptomatic Covid infection either. know even mild Covid still cause long lasting immense damage body. well, least dont general export bans ;) Yeah, forgot advancement science prior capitalism. Utterless braindead person read news titles only. Yawn. 

I point similar population Texas.

And every australian bit accountability performance. gave great deal accomplish situation.

Now, capable answering question? seriously maintaining 5k infections day good job? They're ""donated"". reason tribes first nations get support US government government obligated treaties. agreed exchange something much valuable anyways - land. Treaties US trade native land certain privileges obligations tribes. aid like actually repaying govts debt agreed to. CA, shut gyms indoor dining, even outdoor dining shut good chunk mid March - mid May, early Dec - late Feb 2021. Retail shops also initially outright shut down, opened back limited capacities. Even factories manufacturing warehouses shut except ""essential"" things (remember Elon Musk's whole fight reopen Tesla factory?)

It's year now, indoor dining finally opened first time, also limited capacity.

Some beaches parks closed.

None happened Florida TX. They've bars, gyms, dining, retail open. Factories warehouses pass bureacrat's ""essential"" seal approval. Yet today, FL TX close ahead CA terms deaths/pop, 3 US national average. Texas second highest population US pretty big margin, makes sense. Causing mental issues 8 year olds seems worth save 80 year olds. [PNG Covid Perfect Peggy,""I DEMAND TOTAL SILENCE!!!!!!!!!!!""

People disobeying day now. matter, long they're getting *the coof* cares?

The important thing right ensuring consider wellbeing boomers. talked together decided ban?

[European capitals co-ordinated suspension Oxford/AstraZeneca Italian health minister said banned purely political reasons?

When countries banned, claim waiting EMA say do. ignore EMA say continue vaccinate.  Sorry hear situation. Remember Bolsonaro's largest fan president vast majority pandemic - kicked out, government committed saving lives either. relatively well vaccination damage half million deaths done.

I can't promise things get worse likely get better eventually. Hang there. Biontech distributing Europe, that's biontech literally written vials Pfizer. this, 8 detected cases died. also [The ü§£üòÇüòÖ seeing getting downvoted every comments sub, really need take break going here. Saying ""but people going Applebees!"" even leads anywhere. (who even goes eat inside restaurant instead take-outs pandemic anyways? Even limited).

Also NoamHedges, highly pessimistic ""let's stay home years isolations"" new normal due variants. Scientists working butts day night work effective vaccine deadly less deadly types! said, there's always bright light end tunnel matter tough crucial situation is. positive stay strong, got it? Right. us 24 hours day declare find important. lockdowns. Free breeding grounds isn‚Äôt going accept AZ? Cries Canada Send stolen vaccine back Australia don‚Äôt live Texas optimistic Texans aren‚Äôt going forget. week looked like hell earth. Us prioritized high risk groups. actually less likely covid. Due high chance death. Many people want vax mostly travel etc without restrictions, they're afraid dying covid 

If AZ accepted point getting - 5k new infections per day good job - would bad job look like? actions directly lead increased chances others dying.

Directly? 

Little dramatic think? That's opposite said. Shrinks going make bundle along booze stores lawyers! Germany Paul Ehrlich Institute, national health agency, decided suspension needed. Spain AEMPS, also national health agency. I'm sure applies european countries. ‚ÄúArea man, believed could breath underwater, drowns.‚Äù Yeah, I'm Vancouver living Berlin, I'm astounded they've able keep bars open winter! indoor dining closed since later November recall, pubs even that. 

Glad vaccination going well UK, bet first pint pub going taste really good :) doctor want give 7 jabs. 3 hearts. basically overpowered USA out. Good job everyone. drinking move. became clear Germany pausing, pressure mounted governments hold well, fear seeming incautious sake united front. hard believe virus killed 500k people doesn‚Äôt also damage significant % people caught survived?

The best estimate 4 million Americans hospitalized. 

If virus making hard breathe even slightly, don‚Äôt know rule damage. 

A severe case virus leads death isn‚Äôt different mild case besides magnitude. likely distribution long term health issues.

Does runner used run 7:30 per mile, get 9:30 per mile count 2-3%???

What person caught virus, thought fine scar tissue lungs won‚Äôt develop pulmonary fibrosis 10 years later? counted unproved study claims 2-3%? Choosing beggars Lol personally responsible country‚Äôs performance? Try refrain rabid nationalist. Germany, 180 women age 20 50 died (with) COVID 2021 far, 3 women died vaccination AstraZeneca cerebral hemorrhage/Brian trombose Germany age bracket sorter span. 

So guess reason take closer look AZ batch? Texas second highest population US pretty big margin, makes sense. interestingly, per stimulus bill, $7.5 billion allocated mobile vax units, government idea No, pain injection site could caused poor technique, patient tightening muscles, etc. doesn‚Äôt mean vaccine works. I‚Äôm sure cases gone fewer super spreader events happening DC. ones produced American money? Cool  mean EU getting millions millions AZ doses.

We'd different world high school degrees equivalent required course scientific method statistical concepts. always case released information months ago. Moderna pfizer vaccines also produced 13 10 times less antibodies variant respectively. main thing vaccines stop hospitalizations deaths occurring plus companies producing booster vaccines later added protection variants like this. huge pool virus evolving vaccine escape mutants country next door, affects country next door. think Marburg plant ever going ship UK. matter.

I'd rather trust country world properly handled pandemic, one deaths needs hail mary form vaccine ASAP. Careful bigotry showing. Exactly...expecting.

All countries world going buy them. ignorance matter quite stunning. prioritise detriment others though, fucking useless ally. NGL ally like need enemies. That's exports work...

Nobody paid vaccine United States. 

and China Russian vaccines even go full trials approving it...soo... claim quoted completely fabricated you. didn‚Äôt write it. AZ also wanted supply EU US productiom plants US BLOCKED that. Many JnJ vaccine doses produced EU. EU same.

The US block vaccine exports without consequence, EU can't?? Nonsense. think able get appointment Moderna Vaccine next week. Need drive 2 hours one way get though.

After 1st dose, bit liberal/less stressing about? need physically present help cleaning service company move new office space. better State Washington. I'm fully immunized I'm 65 over, wife health conditions still seen needle, much less grown children. wish would gotten me, would feel better it. looks like wait May opened adult. Trump's term ended 17 million people vaccinated 800,000 shots given per day. reason 2.5 million shots per day due miraculous DPA invocation, normal production distribution ramp up. 

Only fool believe flip switch produce millions vaccine doses overnight due guy signing piece paper. true vaccines, millions of... anything. production capacity see today worked many months ago.

The DPA used February vaccines nothing else ensure production ramp stays track. /s means sarcasm feel getting way semantic. advise benefit/risk analysis positive, think continuing vaccination beneficial. That's virtually synonymous saying advise halting roll-out. like politics local area free move, areas country locked research government research.

It already tho.

Also look China better example fund r&amp;d necessities, cut middle man out.

On side note, far they've also successful handling pandemic, call communism fever dream. already exists quite successful actually. 2 options! /s

Which forgive misinterpreting...sounded like something specific mind. ""simply choosing to""

this probably plays well gammon newspapers childish rhetorical devices work nobody else

we know Brits like full display saying breached contract limited specific way ? Like said, traveling work later year. Potentially (likely) places vaccination unpopular community spread still occurring. didn‚Äôt leave immediate community would fine. that‚Äôs case. I‚Äôm going fly around country. Important note targeting US since importer exporter finished vaccines. Rather, flow ingredients EU US reciprocal. US received total 1 million doses. Even blocked difference make 100+ million doses far. Good, hope Marburg plant, never opened global supply chain. give credit to? Things locked areas country never truly 'exporter' way buy something IKEA, IKEA sending you, country. Seems like get OTA update yet. rollout seems rather slow regions replying OP. replying dseigel2275. definitely placed response.

 ""Strawmen"" make way? kids aren‚Äôt vaccinated! Tanzanians 60% vaccine uptake!  Oh yeah? Well... Well... wait until... want ... Uh... Caerphilly Cheese. Yeah! paying double price prestigious regional cheese. Ha! *Sigh* export bans whatsoever US? deep stuck ass delusional?

And UK de facto export ban. Exclusive access via contract first 100m doses, results exactly same: vaccine whatsoever leaving country currently. Proof: vaccine leaving country currently. this, get least 80% effectiveness protection COVID symptoms one shot either Moderna Pfizer vaccine. also says Pfizer gives 100% protection severe illness death one shot. 2 people got severe illness Moderna shot, seems like close 100% well. Almost one got sick trials one shot Moderna. Yet second shot could cause COVID like symptoms, though actually COVID. uhhhh...ok.  ask manufacturers. UK blocking export vaccine AZ simply choosing supply UK UK vaccine plants. I'd say 4.6 Billion damn sight better Chilli's gift favor take look ""scientist"" salaries Pfizer Biontech make comments.  Oh almost endless lockdowns consequences. get much attention elderly dying though. People say need 100% compliance want control. Coming someone getting vaccination next month real life results UK shows AstraZeneca gives similar protection one dose like Pfizer huge benefits using vaccine too, however able scale production tens millions behind deliveries EU. Sounds like salty fact people starting look issue rationally, place doom gloom echo chamber 3 months ago.  I‚Äôd still say middle pack fair. per 100k column doesn‚Äôt exactly huge range numbers. again, look top. never want life back? people aren‚Äôt gonna change. ""the British""? LBH many meekly accept second summer screens fun allowed Normal Memorial Day. think Moderna isn‚Äôt planning exact thing you‚Äôre delusional doubt Brexit exasperated European tensions. Britain left EU makes sense EU countries would begin putting foot sake citizens. Set two doses. Phase 1/2 trial two dosage levels (call 1x 2x). stimulated immune response. went 1x safety. that's one shot now. 

The trial they're testing 1x/1x separated 56 days. (ENSEMBLE 2) Well, least competing products. Jacking prices would much worrisome Pfizer monopoly position covid vaccines. Yeah bet tbh, can't imagine nothing US vacation. guys probably less normal summer there. L√® Gamm√≥n demonizing EU. think export capacity EU right now? looking vaccines left right, still exporting vaccines UK US.

Accusing EU vaccine nationalism UK US restricting exports hypocritical. EU got lot shit hindered export 250k vaccines Australia, get praise exporting 1 million UK. think UK right export vaccine doses, understand sentiment, can't mad EU same. 
A lot things gone wrong vaccines ordered (e.g. choosing wrong vaccines, weak contracts, limited investments, bureaucratic procedures) feel EU going criticized enough shortcomings. however another discussion.  2/3 65 year olds older initiated vaccination US. age group 80% deaths came from. think stretch imagination say even another surge cases comparable deaths hospitalizations. Russia China, far behind US vaccinations, emulating? Count out. make taxpayers pay winners losers? You‚Äôll get far money invested research incentivize private investment losses distributed across individual investors rather taxpayers. New set, think doses same, J&amp;J one shot, probably get second shot proves effective (I fall category, looking it). Second dose 2 months first trial. doses back Dec Jan, gave birth Feb. small baby however known small prior receiving first shot don‚Äôt think negative side effects tell thus far course last 2 weeks delivered around 3 million week . JnJ vaccines used US Emergent east Baltimore. plants Catalent Merck make rest JnJ vaccines US east coast US. knowledge, JnJ vaccines exported EU US. know underestimating German 'evidence' 'covering coners' otherwise 'legal consequences' pragmatism. cases reported PEI.

Once reported duty politicians oblige go make 'political' decision based qualitative gains. much would've loved see minister spines go it. Why? last thing want someone sue government informing safety protocols vaccines, yes Germans legally that. that's case, people's trust would completely damaged vaccines, can't afford that. 

I like ministers, last thing they'll hampering vaccine campaign supports getting plummeted, lost recent local elections. feel, pulling hairs they've postpone using AZ courage go point. damned do, damned situation.

Yeah, except several places lock none happened. presumption experts locking makes foregone conclusion hospitals overrun people start dying street supported evidence. initial doses amount whole 100m almost enough fully vaccinate every adult UK. might de facto ban effects same. don‚Äôt think US taking anymore vaccines Europe. small batch US first approved Pfizer. think that‚Äôs right.

Not really, UK government direct role UK supply chain deal oxford AZ via vaccine new technologies created using government funding. mRNA vaccines funded government. Also scientist could work government develop vaccines. sure think government innovate. wrote info post. area 3 towns right next eachother.

But bottomline: USA &amp; UK don‚Äôt export, EU (to f.i. UK), eventually can‚Äôt keep that. Either everyone shares one. suck live tighter restrictions get enough people vaccinated. Also, (speaking mainly US US resident) done things right begin with, lasted long. mean, back forth opening closing, stricter lockdown measures, contact-tracing.  sure much credence i'd put this.

Hopefully enough conscience price people still making modest profit, it‚Äôs prerogative choose private business. wish things different? Sure. aren‚Äôt right now. know insist making opiates. fully possible pharmaceutical companies completely wrong area optimal public policy option encourage incentive alignment vaccine investment. 

Any kind public policy economic analysis subject would show policies contain costs vaccine expenses end resulting societal losses orders magnitude larger. want encourage maximum investment area benefits incredibly large relative costs. 

When vaccine means societal benefits thousands (or tens thousands) dollars per person, could possibly think worth horrible unintended side effects come trying save dollars per vaccine? Also, US relies own. might bit disappointing, sabotage roll countries importing big numbers. already feel willingness make scraficies protect vulnerable leaving body. They've already sent 20M tho. end like 25M disingenuous point.

You're lumping every scientist salary together complete disregard work done can't even begin qualify benefits direct salary contributions.

Hell even within Pfizer pay scientist ranges 20/hour 150kish without getting directorial roles.

A quick look fed pay ""scientists"" puts range.

You even bother 30 second google, spouted stuff prayed one would look. Universal public healthcare eliminate market drugs, changes buyers individuals government whole. government would buy vaccines Pfizer bulk distribute them. like NHS UK. Pfizer still makes money, dealing governments instead individuals.

It also means government bargaining power individuals don't, pharmaceutical companies can't charge 1000x price things like insulin say ""buy die"" diabetics. government would say ""no, that's insane, want sell insulin US need charge reasonable prices"". That's insulin costs much US cheap right across border canada.  cumulative impact vaccine plus variants cases declining slower, it‚Äôs concerning think government involvement providing Healthcare different thing government charge healthcare research, development, production. debate merits single payer government subsidized insurance system still maintaining incredible innovation free market able achieve, two mutually exclusive.

bout $75 bucks, pay, spray: Firefighters let home burn

Firefighters rural Tennessee let home burn ground homeowner paid $75 fee. countries people 'deserve' ' vaccine ? Every human earth 'deserves' vaccine equal level. countries acted individually.

Another way saying EU process broken. goalposts move all, comprehend begin with. 

Putting aside Israel's complicated relationship human rights - best come drives point making home. ""It quite successful dropped it"" - words, sustainable. people like said year ago. hope Polish government capable EU government. EU little impact daily life member countries. Except course vaccine failures. Yeah, dare point utter failures EU regime. cuckolds would still supporting EU regime shambolic vaccine handling.

Utter failure European Union. Thank god left appalling organisation. Good riddance. May EU regime collapse oblivion. know mucus, tell personal experience... copious amounts bodily fluids easily come contact tail-end loop. nothing screaming however. way could 6 months faster unless every corner cut. definitely throw enough money wealthy pharma CEOs. money there, orders there. 2 million doses? UK alone probably like 10M doses June, help us vaccinate another 5M extra people. include entire new plant Marburg probably significantly more. 50 million extra doses make huge difference CureVac get approved EMA June J&amp;J underdelivers, likely happen.



(Also US get away exports EU can't? Yeah, think got perfect storm US. Trump America first attitude great securing contracts get prioritized. think Biden administration better logistics delivery. husband said felt maybe little tired second otherwise nothing really first sore arm. love extrapolated bunch nonsense don‚Äôt actually believe factual statement 1.) pharmaceutical companies need capital research, trial, survive failures 2.) money doesn‚Äôt appear thin air.

As things currently are, it‚Äôs supportable giving medicine away cost. Could changes? Sure. it‚Äôs simple ‚ÄúTAX WEALTHY‚Äù much blood clots? data kept? largely nonsense argument? Researchers UK university developed Oxford vaccine, would given UK adequate justification ban produced anywhere UK? ‚ÄúNo. I'm, I'm simply saying life, uh... finds way.‚Äù ‚Äúfirst 100 million shots ours‚Äù, even though CNN showed EU signed deal UK 2 UK facilities contracted produce EU. AZ obscure, hiding previous agreements, ... called out, hide behind everything (I mean, yeah, it‚Äôs complex process missing target 60% 3 months make it? Already knowing you‚Äôll miss next target shady.)

The EU contract terribly unclear lot stuff UK also produce much. People act like making tens millions week yet UK importing EU India factories relatively small. make real difference. EU making enemy distract They‚Äôre one few. Biggest might India? 

India 60% world's vaccine production, sending lot elsewhere. ISI also offered EU 10 million doses like UK took needed used quickly. pre-produced could ship quickly trails over. Dont worry, always vote commission next election... oh wait, shitttttt. I'm sure US would help UK case. 

Well luckily ""America First"" voted out, eh? ;) Would nice see helping anyone change...

Do think UK blocking vaccine raw materials EU would reasonable though? Well course also big difference government paying Healthcare government charge Healthcare development. They're related, separate things. government controlled Healthcare sector still harnessing incredible innovation comes free market system. That‚Äôs rural areas much larger metro (in land size). good example volunteer FD city?

As medicines - it‚Äôs problem overall structure health care system. government busy giving tax breaks could giving incentives develop medicines. Ah, know that. Thanks sharing! Uh, paragraphs lifted directly studies' definitions primary endpoints. J+J's definition clear, listed symptoms similar Pfizer Moderna.

(But thanks clarification even J+J included 'mild' cases, efficacy score would basically unaffected!) mean, sure Netherlands going fine dealing water kind thing. happens kind natural disaster rips like Poland Hungary? options would pretty much mass loss life EU throwing money them. [Press Information Bureau 

Full speech case someone interested New Mexico high rates overweight 75+ medical conditions = adults tired everything labeled fearmongering. 

This concerning. Period. become nothing obnoxious, overstated cop word days. That's irrelevant point made Well imagine physics roller coaster different beach park. I‚Äôm thinking mucus flying air etc.. 48% US states something stupid advise Federal government, would feel way? Yeah, unfortunately bolsonaro LOT support (estimates say third country), people believe follow steps. third country refusing anything actually threatening violence people want deal properly situation.

This one problem. others, rampant poverty lack infrastructure. people water homes wash hands. go work everyday they'll starve there's government help. people ignorant know do. Giving example sticking anyone. giving example. One entirely accurate. Let's move goals posts here. even know I'd humor someone like you, look Israel's (a free country) version lockdown applied early on. quite successful untill dropped it. dare EU same! think ""100% needleless"" doable RN US approved live/attenuated virus based vax..

7 ways get vaccinated without [Indian numbering know, ways someone influenced career move.

You seen news outlet Norway, okay, could've seen neighboring Sweden (I know relevant is, google title article, many reporting statement): money there. can't believe actually think not, siphoned lower middle classes pockets already-wealthy. understand OK people dying preventable diseases house fires, protect Bezos' wealth. growing massive batches virus Scotland? thought China inactivated viral vaccine facilities needed grow quantities needed. 

I hope one works. NY state site: arent 60+, get bunch questions. Weird worldview coming country voted take back control laws borders. EU's turn take back control laws borders decide freely sovereign way, unshackled plutocratic chains held back. EU relying Pfizer vaccines raw materials come UK. EU actually seizes AZ vaccines meant UK, UK likely stop helping Pfizer.

Given AZ vaccine treated media, EU would left vaccines doesn‚Äôt really trust loose ability make vaccines does. so? EU tell would happened without EU input anyway. definition Communism comes Marx Engels. Modern china nothing common ideals.

Ok, prove it, cite something (primary sources) contradicts something CPC doing. Wait, wait.  form goverment specifically built grant power working class remove capitalist ideals country utilizing slave labor bolster capitalist society doing?  Fucking huh?

What slave labor? Keep eating western propaganda. China currently lower percentage people poverty US, contrast life expectancy 35 years less 70 years ago. According Marx capitalism that? answer no.

They go rough times basically feudal society according Marx Lenin there's better vehicle industrialize capitalism, China still day largely rural, adopt measures. contrast DPRK didn't, chose keep economy is, think that's China No, no, Marx's definition modern china nothing common it.  mentioned Mao, that's different discussion, modern CCP communist national socialists socialists.

Again please, quote Marx defines communism show apply China, also show Mao contradicts Marx, Lenin Engels.  Similar argument want govenment control health care, police etc....yes want govenment involved health care. Seems work world loooove online college student reason. much extra time day take care things wouldn‚Äôt otherwise. Young people thinkin world revolves around happiness that‚Äôs crux it, I‚Äôm afraid, it‚Äôs called healthy respect situation hand. multiple friends lost relatives, 2 people early 30s long term health issues.

Perhaps even more, consider brazilian average age (30.3) lower US (37.4). trust chinese made cars, rich buy foreign.

True maybe 10 years ago, true anymore, buy chinese made cars even foreign brands like Audi/BMW made China They‚Äôre going get rammed power crisis reopening. Closing would gotten better graces news cycle opening. 

There‚Äôs simply many states opened done fine line national average point. could call gamble open states states without mask mandates? Florida still better numbers national average despite 2nd highest elderly population 2x many 65+ people per capita California. decided it‚Äôs time let people make decisions numbers continue drop. Flu mutates, make vaccines anyway.

Same logic Covid. situation never bad 2020. Get it. proud EU makes buffoon look like handled Covid well comparison? guess indeed disagree. see coming compassionate place, think thinking flawed.

Unlike masks, sort mine-protects-you yours-protects-me type situation, vaccines protect person gets them. I'm vaccinated, need worry getting virus unvaccinated person. people would risk chosen remain risk getting vaccine, already unhealthy serious concerns vaccine would hurt kill them. last group people few, probably much likely die number diseases mandatory vaccinations.

I agree shame certain diseases nearly gone resurging due anti-vaxxers. I'm terribly worried it, go get vaccines diseases I'll fine. get stressed media reporting stop watching news. become stronger mentally. Realize overreacting live best times. sold at-cost moment though.

I mean obviously can't completely free pay run factories manufacture it.

Pfizer etc. for-profit right now, let alone ""down line"". Great point medical poa. think that. Indeed, would thought given. 

If newborns somehow durable immunity, would surprising, also extremely troubling would suggest vaccine crossed placenta interacted unexpected way child. possible, administering vaccine pregnant women would far riskier currently thought. I'm thinking Russia needs production outside mainland lack (they currently trying make deals Europe) China decided use vaccines soft power starting vaccination campaign mainland (which bad per se, obviously), national vaccines there?

The italian one still months years away usable currently trying strike deals Moderna/Pfizer improve production Country, national one? kinda sound like sociopath, hope know scaremongering bullshit US UK political ploy farce. citizens trust health agencies EMA concludes tomorrow AZ safe used again, Europeans trust that. However, turns something wrong AZ (hypothetical) none agencies would investigated we're talking complete failure trust system lot people would become sceptical. Americans brittish people here/health officials railing European health agencies seem understand actions cause distrust anti vaccine sentiment careful scrupulous investigation experts. Shame agree. times very, difficult now. right thing - rare serious diagnosis appears become less rare following vaccine, gotta investigate. 

I wonder what‚Äôs going on, especially U.K. seeing background levels. Interestingly it‚Äôs younger women (only) running high stats. think things:

* MHRA missed serious illnesses deaths dozen younger British women following vaccine 
* duff batch poisoning continental Europeans
* brand medication used U.K. causes serious interaction vaccine (the contraceptive pill?)
* Genetic effect (don‚Äôt think likely - cases also seen Norway lots Scandinavian genes British Isles due Viking era)
* Seasonal effect - diagnosis naturally common around time year, naively using annual rates makes look worse is
* misunderstood diagnosis - it‚Äôs common previously thought
* something covid time vaccine
* random chance - like winning lottery, terrible
* awful combination above

I hope bottomed soon tough here, helped incompetence government refusing go lockdown early enough (twice) egregiously wasteful spending via dodgy private sector contracts. really looking now, hopefully we'll get summer everyone desperately needs! Looks like topic ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è agree you, he's wrong though - look protests, almost far-right organisation Spain, Netherlands, Germany, UK, etc.

It's opposition lockdown extremist, rather far-right capitalising situation since mainstream parties still support constant lockdowns. Yes, that‚Äôs Tdap flu shots recommended last trimester government stopped vaccinations, except AZ stuff, widely available anyways (and expected anymore, since US hording it, without using it).

The big problem totally fucked vaccine procurement. really sorry that. one mutates evades vaccines: ""Why news coverage variants??!?!"" Saw great website estimated date state country reach herd immunity current rate inoculation. anyone point back site? child almost certainly trained B cells unless vaccine somehow able cross placenta, would extremely problematic. instead maternally-derived antibodies, fade time. argument me. vaccinated elderly nursing homes considerable ammount 80+.

This still prevent hospitalisation numbers going last days number death seems stop declining too.

The new variants seem affect younger people much old variant. concernig outbreaks schools lately.

It's looking good Germany even worse neighboring countries. 

As said, really hope faster vaccination US make difference. still, things turning worse quick. new Corona variants nasty. Quit saying fucking sniffles I'm going hell family line covid. Deaths, one needs kidney transplant now, can't work fill time care givers.

Like fuck ""the sniffles"" fuck off. think dumb compare Sweden Finland Norway Denmark though. seen past pandemics Sweden always country hit worse Scandinavian countries, someone spent lot time Nordic countries central European countries like Netherlands parts Germany would say bad comparison all, considering Norway Finland 1/3 weighted density Sweden Netherlands Germany far similar weighted density. would they? BioNTech smaller pharmaceutical company. particular reason behave altruistically Pfizer. actually failed delivering time Canada point increasing prices. That's great news, great see cases deaths dropping too.

We also see rapid increase second jabs now. don‚Äôt pose real threat shown they‚Äôre affected vaccines. They‚Äôve used topic drive fear they‚Äôre simply huge concern point. Awesome hear. I'm betting April 15th available everyone. oddly enough 8 limbs 10 eyes already are.

What meant governments fail vaccination programmes? can't stop working indefinitely.

But yeah worried rise far-right parties. Unfortunately mainstream parties stepped oppose lockdowns. Get omeprazole you. Works wonders Protection mediated maternally-derived antibodies relatively short-lived, children need vaccinated deemed safe so. Ouch, nurse live Spain. nearly went back see family UK Xmas I'm glad quickly became total mess.

Thanks work though, really tough job made even worse pandemic. hope people appreciate least, even Tories don't. confirm J&amp;J trial still ongoing. 

My old flatmate enrolled two dose trial UK. don‚Äôt words mouth. never said anything variants vs vaccines. nothing special, coronavirus mutating like viruses mutate. expected virus gonna virus.

The important part vaccination rates (and yes know astraZeneca ineffective variants, lets pretend end world pfizer + others well, effective). greed sociopath personality....Do think situation would get bad there'd coup civil unrest? brainwashed ‚Äòopen-up‚Äô crowd downvoting anything pertaining variants continued lockdowns. conspiracy theorists flooding sub.

Most people stopped caring, mods got marching orders telling over, left cranks. 

Compared time last year 50,000 concurrent users peak practically nobody cares subreddit anymore. No, child unlikely long-term immunity virus. almost certain lack B cells trained detect virus. antibodies derived mother, many types antibodies cross placenta. time, passive immunity fade child susceptible. Screw people, thing.  Oh fucks sake. issue there‚Äôs constant talk ‚Äúbut variants! they‚Äôre slightly resistant vaccines!‚Äù zero virus variants evade vaccine significant enough degree would huge issue, variant could could develop booster pretty quickly. Don‚Äôt call conspiracy theorist. Cuba made vaccine always leader health issues. think capitalism answer. I‚Äôm tired seeing new scaremongering another fucking variant every day. Viruses mutate. Unless one completely evades vaccines cares? Yeah, agree point. Emphasize safely slowly reopening vaccinations continue ramp up. way anyone signing lockdown unless hospital systems start collapse hit full capacity again. never gotten point, are. Normalcy horizon, stage game way through. free vaccine ans also non profit line. European countries coordinate stop giving vaccines out

Utter bullshit. European country ""stop[ped] giving vaccines out""? realizing managed influence operation entire time anything unrelated thing tested

Well, *could* related vaccine, disease supposed protecting against. People want society open ""brainwashed."" Okay, got it. become nothing. UK data causes uses vaccines. island. coming country gave world Trump absolutely hilarious. Finally. Hit hard. That's infection. stopped 100% deaths, great. theater mask on, heard several people tell horrible thing do.

Finally common sense Donald Trump thought would never say hell frozen yet thought would ask common sense Donald Trump go together Ah, New Jersey

Now, now. There‚Äôs reason get mean. We're friends here. Well death rate per capita still even 20 worldwide countries lockdown like Spain, France, Italy, Uk etc still much much worse. 

Plus sure restrictions don‚Äôt mask mandates public transport like recommendations. shops bars open since pandemic, never suffered economic consequences lockdown.

And quite frankly we've 13K deaths population 10M, that's literally nothing all. 1% definitely warrant draconian lockdown like countries have. could warrant lockdown actually deadly virus killed like 10% higher. Covid 2.5x deadlier flu vaccines whole world already open completely. excuse valid reason to.

If people scared mild ass virus feel free stay home dubble mask &amp; face shield vaccinated, let us normal people get normal lives already. Places without lockdowns fine keep fine. literally point lockdown never get rid covid. Even NZ still covid cases even though got ""rid"" it.  European countries coordinate stop giving vaccines overblown fears complaining enough vaccines. Get far fuck vaccines people‚Äôs arms issue - even 2 months delays every EU country done October.

After everything gone, can't take timelines face value going lead dissapointed. Sometimes order package arrives says going to, sometimes gets delayed week, sometimes gets lost don‚Äôt get six months. vaccine roll EU right like deadbeat dad saying ‚ÄúI promise I‚Äôll next football game!‚Äù never actually show up. sharp 51% UK population.

1) Covid *profoundly* serious flu. ""Globally, World Health Organization (WHO) estimates flu kills 290,000 650,000 people per year,"" Health.com article ""This Many People Die Flu Year, According CDC"" (I'll link avoid spam filter). Covid killed millions. ""50,000 vs. 100,000"" simply inaccurate; difference *order magnitude*, according article. hard draw bright line there. that's even get covid's serious unpleasantly not-rare long-term side effects.

2) time, *should* take harder look respond flu season. Again, flu far milder covid, response--no need lockdowns, obviously. become normal, expected courtesy Western countries wear mask sick, particularly diagnosed influenza. already normal number Asian countries.

We chose to. speaks volumes, even people want see it. bolsonavirus get worse next 3 weeks UAE citizens (~40% population) essential personnel inoculated Pfizer early last December. Sinopharm ordered rest population time w/o much data. third dose unexpected, early companies waiting 6 month data come in. Let's hope 3-4 months Sinopharm need fourth dose. Failure would doubling instead correcting guidance match new data.

I seriously cant comprehend people like say ‚Äúthis person wrong once, therefore future recommendations worthless‚Äù. now, nobody wrong anything lives? type reaction children have. 

Also even recommend masks start, would anyone listened? Sorry saying 100% hospitalisation stat table true? 

I‚Äôm Moderna absolutely track hospitalisation events. report weekly hospitalisation visit results additional reporting testing. 

I‚Äôm surprised wouldn‚Äôt release data? Yes wasn‚Äôt primary aim study data surely likely released?? I‚Äôve screaming infection rate far away worst country. 
What naturally follows left unchecked increased cases spread multiplies itself. 
Luckily vaccination efforts kicking high gear, hopefully stave uncontrolled exponential growth removing new potential vectors. today‚Äôs birthday it‚Äôs pretty uneventful day. Nothing special happening. 

However, since world didn‚Äôt simultaneously combust like 3/16/20...it‚Äôs already better birthday last year. 

Here‚Äôs next year uneventful today. Really? Expanding pandering fats priority instead making wait whenever normal age category. think enacted wrong restrictions. Saying ""too much"" ludicrous. Saying much areas enough others valid. binary thinking us in. better, right thing less wrong thing would helped lot. anything like Georgia people take second they're actually sitting bar/restaurant.

In scenario, assuming bars/restaurants open indoor seating, people take masks off? one eat drink wearing mask? michigan, lots appointments click see second doses shots exact content-wise, immune response different. future reference would helpful paperwork certifying get full vaccination though, make sure checked out. exactly fault given decentralized distribution is, guidelines/procedures vary state state county county even whether get CVS Rite-Aid. study mentions almost exactly opening paragraphs Despair already picture people taking at-home test wiping frozen pizza box. 12,000 deaths Montana last year? must live forever.  Capitalism absolutely necessary step human development. 

I want world profit motive development science art happens. definitely criticisms made past present non capitalist experiments, stagnation science one. 

I feel like we're getting topic subreddit I'll done here, nice day stay safe. Nobody idea. think first vaccine trials July last year know, least small trial group, protection lasted 8 months beyond data all. vaccination system absolutely broken. prioritizing wrong people. likely die, aka grandma grandparents, priority. People go work priority. people end hospitals people end spreading virus. people working home. 

Instead online sign-up, businesses offered slots employees. Vaccination sites specifically 55 older. Whatever left day, put WFH people standby lists. way, right people get vaccinated, people flexible schedules drop everything go running moment's notice.

I feel shouting void. many people realize absolutely fortunate position really tone deaf people supposedly ""keeping economy going"".

I get want get back lives, really diminishes sacrifice people like make last year, able even WORK safely, people bitch able go fucking beach. people getting vaccinated still work unsafe conditions. makes crazy. Like can't sleep night angry. I've taking huge risk literal life, life loved ones. least society could pay back vaccination date people hiding homes. places people back fall. Meanwhile, still work, vaccine not. hey, put back line. guess people deserve beach time health.

Finally, call number, give us less two weeks dumping rest population onto mess. feel like I'm NEVER going get vaccinated, I'm going watch people go back normal life get left behind AGAIN. much sacrifice. never felt meaningless life. entire society believes expendable. 

And new problem. I've shit society year, everyone use punching bag ""so easy get vaccine things WFH people privilege do"". Try shift worker. Try thirty minute lunch day 45 hour work week. Try getting vaccine know get fired phone duty. Then, tell easy is.

People need understand privileged make people already feel like horseshit feel even worse. least people do. that's feel needs shouted void. least one person thinks twice opening mouth, I'll feel better. Yes, point possible politicians try avoid reopening reasoning. yeah, facebook cesspool. speaks average age redditors. people 40 really complaining. Neither people 20. 10% redditors 16-25 complain, see vote totals.

Hence lot ""give everyone!"" posts. wonder share genetic code one found across English Channel B.117 not? Looks like use combination RNA Testing Covid sniffer dogs detect strain isolate part France Only. Yeah, except completely stupid. politician wants people work? think gets votes? Campaign contributions? won‚Äôt reopen close next winter season. extended July, probably persist 2022.  thing though, hyper-extreme binary ""EITHER-OR"" kind scenario. 

It's perfectly possible individual ""do thing"",. yet also ""not impact others negatively"". 

The problem people want ""do thing"" ""impact others negatively"". 

For example.. want build hot rod muscle cars burnouts etc.. there's times places ways that. School Zone Wed 3pm,. one them. 

One primary thoughts that's always going inside head every day is:.. ""How accomplish various things need do. .with MINIMAL impact others?""

It's hard thing do,. practice require ""thinking others 1st"". hear you. I've looked Norway's numbers, compare country (Canada) case fatality ratio overall low, I'm surprised deaths healthy individuals 40 age group. overall CFR 0.7% - exceedingly low compared many, many nations, including (we stand 2.4%). Canada, we've seen 117 / 465k 40 age range, 0.02%. 

Curious though, think AZ risk vs Covid risk older folks, worrying pre-existing conditions? constant fear mongering everyone, long Covid seems psychosomatic lot people.

Fixed you. 65% Texas' death rate means 50% greater death rate Texas Wyoming. Simulated Sunlight Rapidly Inactivates SARS-CoV-2 Surfaces: estimated risk infection touching contaminated surface low (less 5 10,000), suggesting fomites play minimal role SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.""

People avoiding J&amp;J vaccine one US see 66% vs 95% take face value lot nuanced that. No, May enough population vaccinated avoid surge infections despite loosening restrictions. real-world examples back up: cases Israel, 46% population fully vaccinated, dropping steeply even restrictions lifted. However, cases started consistently dropping week-over-week ten days ago, would take quite bit vaccinations places US reach herd immunity. extent, yes. Little kids understand wearing masks. 2 year old - time he's fine it, meltdown mask there's really nothing let take off. Thank complying.
-State California Florida lowered 60 Monday. Saw last week still 1.5M seniors shot.

May here. We're getting AZ matter even lot people want - doses get given want it.

I thinking suspension AZ would halt vaccine programme, saw many fact get - far really matter. think would probably close normal proof vaccination. US never stringent incoming flights quarantining UK seems bit relaxed EU. point can‚Äôt picture another huge surge would prompt closure borders either Wow obese might actually save life think Might relevant J&amp;J one Phase 3 trial conducted SA variant impact comparison vaccines, 1-2 strains. Source? LOL. Talk fake news. opposed **mandatory** vaccinations. One last projects make easier state government buy vaccines emergency rules, without federal approval.  Well least used :) Wait, mask wearing child abuse? Uk least, aim vaccinate much population possible one dose initially - that, pushed 12 weeks doses, went guidance. 

It turns increase gap doses actually increases efficacy, driving factor UK made decision. think test unproven vaccines kids yet. Yeah. site using screen-scraping methods tell. really APIs centrally defined. UK variant much contagious children. starting see outbreaks among kids it. stats incorrect, far tell. California square middle pack, ranking #30 cases per capita.

The five best states Hawaii, Vermont, Maine, Oregon Washington - either geographically isolated heavily locked down, cases both.

Washington‚Äôs lockdown clearly worked, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs clear cut Plenty old people nursing home workers rejecting vaccine. they're dumb data efficacy Pfizer 1 week first dose? Yes wrote article mom. know going listen me. Yes used passive aggressive tone always use.  much take.. AZ deliver many besides already took 9 million vaccines Europe (EU exporting vaccines UK) Canada's vaccine supply low country shifting delaying second dose vaccines 4 months. IIRC concerns w AZ vaccines related blood clots, ITP It‚Äôs doubled last two weeks. percentage positive nearly tripled form 3% 8.6% today. 

Michigan objectively surge. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre arguing this. cool site!

One thing noticed least state, doesn‚Äôt seem sucking data local Health Dept vaccinations, retail. able get vaccinated calling town/county‚Äôs health dept.

I know would hugeeee undertaking, perhaps longer worth stage, would benefit federal, official version site like could tap every possible vaccine distribution vector data (which site like can‚Äôt do).

Wasn‚Äôt going happen Trump, though. mean? People allowed go walk etc. literally impossible gather. really surprised people tired confined home year restrictions? defining obesity? Maybe parents areas essential workers can't take care children working home work outside home school district? Asymptomatic infections still occur unvaccinated, clue. Either possible, suppose. Onion good.  Beautiful. Take gold. Why? Seems like pretty concise way referring ""muh rights! I'm deeply oppressed ask wear mask global pandemic!! Time start attacking walmart employees!!"" type idiots... unless one that's offended it? mystery, made enough everyone yet. yep, thats bare minimum couldve done earlier pandemic send money parents earmarked childcare services, least thats kinda happening stimulus bill so, better late never guess lol consensus reinfections much common thought best study following US marines strict observation put reinfection rate 10% 7 month period.

There medical scientists deny escape mutations, reinfection rates recombinants 2021, even though clear view things recently December 2020. It‚Äôs worth mentioning nobody actually made pay these. Insurance covers full cost government picking tab everyone else. Red Cross donations detect antibodies vaccine? regularly donate blood always tested negative antibodies past year. next donation start April first time I'm donating fully vaccinated. curious know expect positive antibody result. Razzmatazz: Hurr durr I'm making ""America bad"" jokes. fair, Ohio Republicans really seemed like wanted kill DeWine say 'appears unvaccinated person' brought virus, know that, bunch vaccinated people also it?

Wouldn't likely vaccinated person, feeling fewer symptoms, brought thinking they're fine? Get shot actually help Thank do!!! went health department vaccine clinic seamless operation. Finally starting see light end tunnel. Think I‚Äôll still clean hands much often pandemic, though haha thread overtaken virus deniers, evidently. Current trends pointing exactly direction states reopening quickly lifting mandates. Wearing mask easy help avoid prolonging pandemic further. Bars restaurants open though.. opened well Valentine's Day (or week of, can't quite remember).

I'm curious anything insanely warm weather we've (upwards almost 70 degrees F, uncharacteristically warm February/March). I've noticed bunch people gathering warm weather, unmasked socially distanced.

I'm sure play HUGE role wondering. Doesn‚Äôt seem weird 71 vaccinated facility 13 weren‚Äôt? 

Like, reject vaccine? It‚Äôs since nursing home residents made eligible... bringing vaccines facility wouldn‚Äôt vaccinate them? One problem trials pretty much hospitalizations deaths CONTROL groups getting placebos. 100% number pretty meaningless.  claiming reach magic threshold, COVID immediately disappear? Because... no, doesn‚Äôt work way.

R0 continue decrease people get vaccinated, COVID still spread remaining unvaccinated people burns remaining embers. 

Once it‚Äôs gone, much trumpeted ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù means new infection introductions burn quickly grow - doesn‚Äôt mean everyone magically becomes immune COVID-19 even don‚Äôt vaccine. they‚Äôre unlucky person catches infected visitor, they‚Äôre definitely getting sick - nothing herd stops happening.

MRNA vaccines really, really fucking good - appears ~90% effectiveness two weeks single dos

[The efficacy Pfizer single dose around 52%, sure top head Moderna would one dose.

You really need 2nd dose boost Pfizer BioNTech covid-19 vaccine may provide early protection, starting 12 days first dose, peer reviewed results phase III trial study, published New England Journal Medicine,1 found vaccine efficacy first second doses 52% (95% credible interval 29.5% 68.4%), 39 cases covid-19 vaccine group 82 cases placebo Seven days second dose, vaccine efficacy rose 95% (90.3% 97.6%), eight covid-19 cases reported vaccine group 162 cases placebo group. terrifying first child pandemic. started trying baby February 2020 got pregnant right away. Found week work shut down. never felt scared. wish could normal could celebrate life, feel like keep hidden world keep safe. 

That said, brave enough let test vaccine. anything went wrong, could never forgive myself. People keep saying shit, continues true. Reinfection? like 30 confirmed Reinfection cases world wide? momma cousins father law best friends barber shit seems keep getting spread around? hasn't. Compare Florda California. I‚Äôm real happy y‚Äôall, Ohio friends! clue, still take long time imo. government healthcare system absolutely betrayed children response COVID. Lockdowns mask-wearing destroyed mental health far virus would destroy physical health.

All measures forms child abuse. choice experts listen fully political.

No ... governments supposed listen appointed board experts deal medicine.

A politician can't overrule national medical board countries say safe. that, point experts own. truth Pfizer didn‚Äôt receive funding Operation Warp Speed **development, clinical trial manufacturing vaccine.** Rather, partner, BioNTech SE, received money -- German ‚Äú... research involved adding droplets model coronavirus called HCoV-OC43 ‚Äì similar structure survival pattern SARS-CoV-2, causes Covid-19 ‚Äì polyester, polycotton 100% cotton.‚Äù

""let plague run unabated want people die,"" there's really much do, keeping restrictions light may least prevent damage education, mental health, keep people poverty (which also kills) etc. side coin essential workers front line suddenly tasked spending $1,000 month childcare services essential work still required go work, state says child endangerment leave 6 year old home.

Added childcare costs, daily risk infections, stuck enforcing state guidelines local law enforcement even it, front line workers kinda got screwed seven day average 1000 almost half year.

Dunno that. leave house 3 months last spring, except donate blood. far stranger danger goes seems relatively safe, simply let building without mask temperature check boot.

Unacceptable. I‚Äôm calling Dr. Fauci. older..? Surely can‚Äôt serious. really not. mRNA vaccines regimented empirically effective. JnJ eventually booster likely increase efficacy higher reported date (just like booster would, including second dose mRNA vaccines), then, would advise high risk population get mRNA-based vaccines.

source? Real mystery mentioned Trump admin little. Didn‚Äôt order 600mm vaccine doses something tune? Since little 100mm given Us...it amazing think article little Trump admin. using ones Trump admin ordered quite time come.

Not available yet...some manufacturers...but still without doubt using doses ordered last year. Yes - mother understand web app replaces *literally thousands* call center exployees could possibly efficient, local CVS, four pharmacy techs serving metro area 3M people, might trouble answering 500 calls per hour. parents still allowed get vaccine appt anything 60s Missouri still stuck administering vaccines second tier medical personnel government workers (or maybe least week ago, idk sure tier now). could wrong feels like MO going slow compared many states. could feeling impatient. Oh god would hit woman bad wedding-replanning day üòÇ Inevitable? Please. Amazing.

We virus potential make sick, show tests. 

So can't things.... Because? said two weeks first dose, first dose. 52% figure includes 21-28 days doses, vaccines definitely effective 10ish day window. significant confidence interval relatively narrow window time (and therefore samples), [best guess efficacy Pfizer Moderna. Data Israel UK elderly populations indicate lower efficacy, still greater JnJ (against higher variant mix JnJ test study) elderly would expected weakest immune response (even two full doses - 95% trials - 88% populations). study shows 52% 14 days first dose. 

The second dose elevates effectiveness even further, keep resistance far longer second dose. appears likely mRNA vaccines indeed effective JnJ adenovirus vaccine single dose. got message VA clinic stating shots (Moderna) available vets regardless age (I'm 35 thought might wait weeks). Incredible news!! work night shift seriously considering going get morning. California. Disneyland Tokyo least educated geography logistics. Even high school level education suffice. no, country world similar US successful. literally happen. one comparable US China. China used example. I've read adenovirus vaccines increase risk getting HIV even groups low risk. true bs? Read article. 100% effective preventing death severe cases. effective preventing sickness altogether. try anything else? headache gone, im still sweating like whore church. I've taking asprin that. think ibuprofen would work better? No. Due social distancing requirements would bad idea car someone long. Apparently places far west Texas enough could walk without appointment get them. France Italy ""Europe"". There's lot countries ;) Presently deadlier influenza immunologically na√Øve population. anything possible, *likely* deadly currently time. one's said there's anything wrong taking multiple vaccines really want higher efficacy one, refusing available wait one foolish. There's way 100% ""safely isolated""; I'm sure tons people gotten covid thinking perfect security measures. 

If hold knows long Pfizer whatever, quite possibly higher risk complications worry protected lower efficacy vaccine. Oh god, yes! I'm area dont many established friends. WFH, actually time meet new people, nigh impossible meeting strangers minefield right now. thank lucky stars least fiance date mess. friends ROUGH. GDP 387 billion year, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs pretty good investment. guy's insinuating people long covid psychosomatic since least mid last year remember right. always weird think several Canada's biggest cities ""just"" border US hundreds even thousands square miles of...not much. 

You drive due south Calgary like two day drive get place major league team. Yep right. Ibuprofen also helped lot actually know many people sick Covid? 

This going sound obvious, do. know bunch people gotten sick covid, fine even hospitalized. going controversial here, part, fault got sick.

Then grandfather, 80s years life left got covid. lived nursing home nothing could done avoid getting sick. disease likely passed staff visitor who, like many people know, careful. Suddenly, know someone died covid. want you.

Also, covid IFR around 0.5% around 1/3 population infected. 1 600 died. average size (large) social circle, absolutely makes sense people, like you, know anyone died. 0.5% HUGE number people, much higher fatality rate flu, would much higher number hospitals overrun. Yeah, wasn‚Äôt super common Canadians seemed downright giddy finally getting comeuppance electing Trump, even us didn‚Äôt vote deserved suffer it. 

Now I‚Äôm seeing lot accusations bad allies we‚Äôre finally benefitting one thing Trump right aren‚Äôt. Interestingly, types skip right Canadian government assigning blame. actually pretty old. heard long time ago. EDIT: heard Disneyland Tokyo, apparently

But still ridiculous, yes. afaik thats states it, honor system. wont really matter weeks supply outpaces demand anyways don‚Äôt actually think that‚Äôs could‚Äôve gotten virus control you? plenty examples countries getting virus control without going full China. Quit hyperbole get grip reality mate. whole pandemic political. people stupid? Thanks! really wish access information this. really tough. alone.

That said, recent Nature study seems suggest Moderna Pfizer may hard time South African shit load money effort. Google it- yes- may good enough own. think it‚Äôs helped cold flu season. use arm hammer stuff, it‚Äôs useful I‚Äôve using years. definite preference doesn‚Äôt irritate much. Unlike betadine propolis doesn‚Äôt kill virus- colds flus infection respiratory area would probably help lot. may help sick, think helps right away wash nose potential exposure. ENT Vanderbilt said washing nose might make sense. every potential exposure- including three covid positive people never tested positive antibodies $25 Kroger test. could potentially wash away especially used super frequently right brief exposures. propolis irritates don‚Äôt right concentration think betadine would too. proof isotonic saline helps covid don‚Äôt think anyone else it‚Äôs kind common sense. Godly. Love name btw Michigan seems get shit together. That‚Äôs happen women charge. governor, Hogan, incompetent fool. mean makes sense people talking USA 3 shots currently going arms. vaccine could protect current variants - maybes facts. studies done vaccines CURRENT variants found less coverage. I‚Äôm really hopeful next months, sub blind optimism. 

I literally don‚Äôt give shit downvotes care US getting skis finding hard way - again. It‚Äôll take weeks us know right decision open relax everything. Maybe got right time. hope so. But....brexit, AZ, ineffective... AMEN. means Ohio seeing less demand supply.  PNG one poorest countries world. capitol, Port Moresby closely resembles scene Road Warrior actual modern city.

If ever PNG, believ everyone ALREADY got it, gotten foothold till - mostly due fact major visitors would coming Australia (where never REALLY). family like put ‚Äúdo disturb‚Äù don‚Äôt get sound banner notifications. I‚Äôm dealing schedule, mine (when mental energy admit almost never also decreased texts).

Good luck vaccines- hope get one soon! rate, hard imagine you‚Äôll wait much longer sold cost request Oxford Glad worked you! noticed Rite-aid dumped whole bunch new appts system seem every day around midnight. 

Walgreens seems borked moment. wish long COVID studies focus much self-reported symptoms also attributed anxiety, depression, inactivity. Lasting effects exist. they're often permanent, definitely exist. 

There's disconnect happens media reports COVID lead permanent side effects, media reports long COVID sort unbelievably high rate among general population (per self-reported studies). people read headlines listen everything see TV conclude there's extremely high chance get permanent lung damage catch COVID, even asymptomatically. Yea look much EU saved going cheapest option Man, breath fresh air. everyone's right practice religion. believe believe America. feel somebody suffers hidden illness myself. People understand foundation relate to. Even working doctors difficult many answers. fun realized surgery cure merely meant improve quality life. never able tell looking feel awful times, something live with. even bother explaining people understand start tossing ""things try"" understanding magic cure.

Approximately 38% US population eligible donate, 6.8 million donate year, totally right saying. *feel* obese eating much Fiber One? cases dropping well vaccines would effect. They‚Äôre helping course. variants ‚Äúweaker‚Äù die off. variants ‚Äústronger‚Äù become new dominant strain. Evolution.

Hopefully get enough people vaccinated reduce amount chances new variants. However might see new ones pop ‚Äústrong‚Äù enough get past vaccines. God hope not, that‚Äôs viruses work. phases done. bullshit political propaganda opening next phases without getting previous ones. Virginia phase 1C eligible meaningless PR politicians can't actually schedule appointment get it. 

You 100% correct verifying anything though. posted another thread yesterday. co-workers 20-30 years old, healthy, working home, etc got vaccinated January. assholes? Absolutely. vaccine rollout totally fucked overly confusing clownshow? Also yes Exactly. said thing! that's 1000 New Yorkers! Like, city PACKED that's managed scrape up? 

No surprise ig, people believe whatever mainstream narrative favor month. Nah kids getting vaccines like fall, you‚Äôre going see plenty kids getting sick now.

‚ÄúOh noo, buh muh sciences said immune!‚Äù That‚Äôll sub months. decisions, decisions never worse time healthy, non-obese Texan. Take pity us, denizens tiny, underpopulated states phase 3G whatever. mean Ohio enough vaccines go around? made predictions? people said we‚Äôd 20,000 cases day Canada March? live Michigan work urgent care facility tests covid. Things quiet last month last two weeks. Several area high schools outbreaks linked sports, specifically wrestling. school closets facility currently 180 students quarantined due exposure. would rather million chances dieing instead 999,999? sounds like something would come handy flu season whenever someone work sick. Would isotonic saline good enough? changed it.  wouldn‚Äôt put much faith them. Follow news, reputable news, read articles see went vaccine production. breathe. Full effect? US one third population vaccinated results starting show, they're pretty damn drastic. need herd immunity see full effect vaccines have. Finally, someone least partially believes Human Rights letting fear control them. Imagine freedom much minority... feel you. I‚Äôm desperately trying get partner vaccinated meanwhile friends got offered job declined. understand it‚Äôs personal decision but... still frustrating. Yea no, schools virus factories.

I worried teachers since they‚Äôre getting vaccinated frankly go get sick poor decisions idk. thoughtless comment. I'm teenager online school year point. I'm pretty lucky grateful affected much given mental problems even though miss seeing friends classmates person hilarious, like truly quixotic UK variant. Duh. Exactly. wonder Reddit seen place severe ignorance circlefucking lol. much Constitution ig  Old info.

/s way 1B done yet, signed 1/22 got vaccine today. Letting 1C skip 1B unmoral. problem think verifying anything anyone could list anything get 1B. ain't one. suspect lot people like idea long covid jibe ""COVID problem old people, care old people die, ruined economy nothing"" narrative. seems disingenuous numbers shown et solid grasp actually means. test sample pretty small, trials different, clear indications metrics used, etc.  Rite aid

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 2 min sun, sorry can‚Äôt find source anymore. released around April 2020 CDC Locking always reduces spread. Locking early enough eliminates completely. PCRs sequencing different procedures. PCRs, molecules attach tiny fraction viral RNA multiply millions times send signal examiner. tiny part molecules used PCR mutated, molecule attach get signal. I'm *guessing* part mutated French case. little information far, another reason. I'm pretty sure case viral load, viral load needs low escape detection PCR. 

There many possibilities, hard say want speculate much right now. Lets wait see. Great! hope supporters line get vaccine! Yeah 3 months people probably bother follow cases way down. I‚Äôll upvote April fools guys, enough wish government worked produce J&amp;J Brazil. AZ Sinovac already is. US full slow walking scum happen walk middle sidewalk well.  word April month they‚Äôll open floodgates. Makes sense. wrap head around it, since I'm half age, feel like walking speed varies quite dramatically workouts, yard work, etc Lol picture child bubble makes angry. phot isn‚Äôt anything celebrate chatting friend earlier today. seems simple easier manage logistics let alone regarding COVID transmission risk. far covid vaccine sites mass vaccination site haven‚Äôt outbreak area. People wait spread out, don‚Äôt wait waiting room, you‚Äôre injection. don‚Äôt really anyone that. Plus live near Lansing northern far. Lashed UK/AstraZeneca sending enough doses, citizens get sick die.

Because sending enough doses, citizens getting sick dying. What's wrong Stamped feet threatened cut overseas shipments vaccine.

I agree there. less foot stamping actual cutting off. worked Sent large number doses overseas anyway via COVAX.

I'm informed this. Maybe commitment Spread misinformation effectiveness AZ 65s.

Not EU. Macron, leader single country EU, relation ""staying independent"" Blocked international shipments AZ Australia needed EU.

And AZ fulfilling contract. fully support Suspended use safety fears.

Again, EU. Individual countries took initiative EMA saying vaccine safe (now EMA investigating, still never recommended suspension). Nothing ""staying independent"". Well got vaccine 2 weeks ago. still dealing covid effects, hair loss breathing issues. feel MUCH better breathing wise hair coming back good pace. Idk body took good turn, vaccine taking lingering effects cause got vaccine anxiety levels gone down. 

Id like think cause vaccine jumo started immune system got rid residual covid issues. lesson? Get vaccine UK vaccinated 20 million. People received AZ lower clots Pfizer (13/15), lower expect vs general population.

It's possible bad batch produced EU plant, extremely clear there's issue vaccine itself.

AZ cheapest they're trying produce cost, they're cutting corners profits, charge costs. others charge 10 times much, currently talking great opportunity charge even more. Probably thanks absolute bullshit that's reported since inception. Makes wonder. threshold might considerably lower, also differ country country, depending heterogeneous population is. See example see. Guess getting doses üòÇ Lol proof? irony 40th birthday being....–úarch 29 state sets power prices? Yeah, ""the government paying it"" means paying. money delivered Mars NASA's rovers. shouldn't. I'm vaccines, people autonomy bodies. Except setting insane power priced arbitrary formula... dreadful news. I‚Äôm teacher honestly hard children‚Äôs mental health. big issues play here: disruption routine, expectation levels homeschooling biggest one many parents impossible parenting situations. It‚Äôs complex shown many parents love kids don‚Äôt actually like parents. overworked, underpaid free child care school taken away, family units almost completely fell apart.

 huge advocate parents know incredibly tough job lack thoughtfulness essentially meant children weren‚Äôt prepared parent. It‚Äôs shown much parenting schools do. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs ideal. 

Of course little money parenting homeschooling pandemic almost completely impossible. guess pandemic highlighted huge problems society sweeping problems workplace exploitation nuanced family dynamic issues. 

So often. mean often schools place children get escape really toxic home environments. Schools blameless perfect. neither families. ones let children deserve much better. society needs lot therapy. mean wrote. mean wrote. Hmm definitely heard people refusing AZ shots missing appointments. 

I'm sure that's happening, reality vaccines available compared demand AZ massively underdelivered (especially compared Pfizer), cancellation AZ appointment, several others eager take place.

I'd get bike vaccination center right away AZ doses available me. many feel (though perhaps different preferences mode transportation). God damn rationalizing boot licker right here. seem hard ask people want AZ. guess implies study limited early tell effective vaccine variant. Sensationalist headline. Covid kills 1 100 ? allowed go outside, protest, hook girls tinder yet still crime? Funny German media saying opposite criticising health minister 'political' continuing vaccination. Experts problem continuing AZ, rightly so. Based survey today, 71% German accept AZ without question, even better percentage weeks ago. 

PEI independent institute supervises health issues advises politicians. say something needs investigated resuming vaccinating again, politicians oblige. Opposite would political decision even though could saved lives. would finally right decision politician context German health minister spines override PEIs decision legal purposes. 11 months late, thanks guess. know honest. Iys partially easier due fact teachers given us slightly less work get sick either shot - got sick first. couple days feeling ill. live EU, chance get vaccine all, look like three months least.

If went queue offered AZ groups, even everyone, even ~67% skeptics would still find enough people willing take consume dosis arrival (taking account AZ relatively small percentage doses EU receiving, due to, well, screwups).

So think sunk anything yet, need flexible. Fuck yah told would happen. Care explain why? Moderna shots done Walmart without issues. get flu like symptoms either shot. first pfizer one. Yeah, funny non-profit vaccine one suffers huge disinformation FUD campaign... ok. best luck friend, brother OCD well struggling off. turns increase gap doses actually increases efficacy 


There evidence AZ vaccine, evidence I'm aware mRNA vaccines (and 95% efficacy, much room improvement anyway). got sick first pfizer shot.

My mum get sick either shot Reminds Monte Python skit ""bring yer dead..."". 
 ""I'm feeling much better actually..."" seriously doubt first baby born Covid-19 antibodies; first pregnant woman vaccinated (or vaccine, become pregnant, given birth) followed up. There's lot drama queens sub understand perfectly normal temporarily suspend use new vaccine medicine cases needs investigated. 51 next month 2nd shot Moderna kicked ass 36 hours. Chills, mild fever, body aches, killer headache I'd wake cold sweat. get bed pee 20 hours. (many) pharmacies sell homeopathic ""treatments"", need say more?  That's thing him: knows exactly what's going on. followers don't. Charles D. thing. India also 40m AZ vaccines expire April, they've given 10m UK UK able use time. 30m offer EU help make order, EU finished auditing facility India yet (UK February). Also mentioned Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine also provide protection mild/asymptomatic Covid infection either. know even mild Covid still cause long lasting immense damage body aka Long covid. AZ vaccine actually protect that. inactive virus mRNA vaccines it? UK decided Europe. walking back gym late tonight wearing shorts got catcalled drunk ass women already celebrating st patricks lmao. summer gonna great. hate st patricks though haha moderate shoulder pain first dose side effects whatsoever. think good. That's true governments. buying tens millions doses $3 adds up. think question - vaccine causes even thrombosis? many acute cases going get worse time? need send Australia UK countries speed vaccination campaigns even more. meant say would experience many long Covid sufferers never got diagnosis PCR (And time, testing limited). got sick spring 2020, got lumped Covid longhaulers. Pfizer might ask money product competitors, ability expand production deliver time proven crucial part ending pandemic, particularly European Union. 
The vaccine currently sold price lower many non-covid vaccines. don‚Äôt think unreasonable Pfizer future would like normal market value evaluation product future, crisis over. huge problem developed countries. developing undeveloped countries problem.

Although rollout scale also run lack hypercold freezers. Getting mine Tuesday Tribe. Feel blessed. someone Europe, amazes much USA turned around. Going one worst hit nations world, front-and-center vaccinating people. makes jealous. I'm 35, healthy ... can't wait get shot whatever available Netherlands. seeing fuck alot things, it'll probably turn 2058 ... something like that.

Imagine friends- literally unable get year. Awful I've throwing sea.  getting point vaccine man... Brexit fan

Well Corona showed world terrible EU is.

I envy you. want part shitshow anymore. amazing fell lockdown campaign. Sinvoc horrible I'd like know leaked US already received stockpile AZ still FDA approval. *This* variant detectable *this* test. That's know far. Super unlikely. I've heard coworkers say this. scientifically established correlation ""side effects vaccine"" ""side effects real thing""?

Given understanding nearly half contract covid 19 at-most ""mildly"" symptomatic (no, source beyond unscientific news headlines), far half vaccinated present ""mild"" symptoms, would seem direct correlation.

I'd interested reading research topic. true. agree sequencing find variant show PCR test Well, keep mind AZ deliveries slowing time goes by, need keep much doses injected second shot, 12 weeks later.

AFAWK, current rate, AZ deliveries could stop altogether. Unfortunately reason large parts world seem believe Europe higher standard apolitical scientific rigor trustworthy media political class fact turns do.

Which means damage fight Covid well outside borders.

You decide believe. Meanwhile, Pfizer HQ - ""Time jack price even further!"" saying said informed France Italy

You fact making up? seen 20 different docs/specialists. fever SoB manifestations anxiety. comment full American nationalism vs EU nationalism lol. Also, patients received placebo hospitalized.

So maybe placebo prevents severe symptoms, hospitalizations death ‚Äì like AstraZeneca! wasn‚Äôt issue people skipping appointments mismatch government priority groups RKI. Hold horses, study looked mild disease. didn‚Äôt study severe disease (the normal metric). body hi vaccine died. Nobody vaccine went hospital. 

Better yet good efficacy Kent strain likely become dominant strain worldwide. That's great got physical! one 2 years (covid blame missing last year course). general think people look BMI curiosity see qualify may surprised. USA we've really normalized overweight obese. I'm proud USA positive vaccination news. I'm Germany think go back home month get vaccinated. slow here. mail letter go whole thing.  Actually, far 10 people 50 died C19 Norway. Source: surprise myth British press. 

Actually, Italian press writes Paris annoyed pages filled. Keeping certain restrictions still save lives bringing cases zero faster think it‚Äôs pretty rich countries complaining US sharing AZ supply they‚Äôre pausing use AZ even using supply. Yea didn‚Äôt look mild disease primary outcome study. Quick remember everything political. Even whole organization toilet political. 

While waiting scientific answer two questions 

\- Shall rather stop vaccination campaign nothing (with risk delayed) shall rather keep vaccinated product/batch might dangerous ? 

\- public worried incident occuring vaccine campaign. shall government tell reason worry (remember Chernobyl ?) shall government hear concern pause campaign get information. 

It's scientific decision, political decision. absurd take decision. current context people want zero risk society. No, lot criticism Texas' actions. gamble governor took. gamble. 

I want Texas residents okay, partner, covid incubation period 2-14 days. mask mandate ended 9th, believe. course hospitalizations going drop tier system place prioritizes at-risk. That‚Äôs like comparing two cars, one go 120mph another go 100mph going corner store street. fine. thing CO! don‚Äôt solid date yet, it‚Äôs gotten much optimistic. We‚Äôve gone ‚Äúwe may able START vaccinating people middle summer‚Äù ‚Äúeveryone access vaccine mid-April.‚Äù bad press much Europe wanting it, may brand given away Biden already making list giving away. think PEI political influence? Exactly this. authorities show take issues seriously, increase trust authorities help restore trust AZ vaccine (provided issues found). citizens felt authorities taking concerns seriously, would long-term damage trust AZ vaccine authorities. Also keep mind Nordic countries already cautious vaccines due Pandemrix narcolepsy scandal 10 years ago.

An update expected tomorrow, going take months/years. temporary pause legitimate safety concerns investigated. politics, science. Also, mentioned, vaccination capacity far outweighs supply time, makes easy catch safety concerns cleared. really information. Variant detectable standard covid PCR, likely patient negative things got pretty bad doctor ran extra test find have. May-be friend sick week covid got variant. However, beside negative PCR test search relevant. Ok, get 60 going ask voluntary euthanasia right? supposed die get old. European countries extremely well poorly. Uk Serbia example surging well ahead. 

Fed ""europe"" talked one giant country. made available everyone Alaska, issues appointments. small population I'm sure number doses receive relative population. I'm worried. They're ramping vaccine production. resist. months Netflix film America singlehandedly saved world defeating virus. hope us least Smith plays role Ugur Sahin. People seem understand public health member state competence EU can't force governments act certain way. interesting though, daily positive test count still quite high US (50k). Although, understandable vaccines mainly prevent disease (COVID-19) instead virus (SARS-CoV-2). again, heard vaccines also effect transmissibility.

Can anyone gauge expected positive test amounts US? Literally ü§£ , hes conservative Whatsoever either. Conservatives go church, not. Conservatives balance budgets, decrease debts, increased deficit debt. True, seem much difference Moderna vaccine used, gets delivered comparatively small numbers. don‚Äôt mean offense this, trust judgement several european health agencies random redditor say. hope you‚Äôre right though, EMA offers positive conclusion tomorrow. EU suspended anything. Public health member state competence. decision suspend national governments contradiction EU (EMA) statements saying AstraZeneca vaccine fine. data wastewater analysis great concern. rise epidemic Attica great. explosion Crete.

To give context, Greece's economy near collapse hoping open tourists month. ICU levels 100% Athens country 5th month lockdown. virus almost 100% British variant substantial increase number children hospitalised political pressure would continue vaccinations. maybe smear campaign true thing kinda worst vaccines count attenuated ones. think extra doses give countries like Brazil, Italy others suffering. Canada buy doses need help let's give others however. Good used dread getting yearly flu shot, given things changed come fall I‚Äôm going hesitate that, another booster covid. Virulogist spoke claimed prevent mild prevent severe either. Israel data seems support - level efficacy mild, moderate severe. So, mean opening back dropping mask restrictions hasn‚Äôt affected things much? No, CVST, expected occur 3-5 times per year per million people unvaccinated population, compared 7 cases weeks 1.6 million vaccinations. vaccines ""belong"" EU. AZ contracts countries, fact EU blocked exports Australia instead working company increase supply absolutely supported. Exactly that's even mention consequences lockdowns, short definitely worth it.

From gay sex, europe give blood again! get decide Europe, Geographers say part continental shelf west Ural river Europe.

This includes Western Kazakhstan, far know even contemplated joining EU. considering volatile AZ's deliveries been, i'd keep bit stockpile well.

Frustrating fuch cannot wait vaccine Saturday Ok. get then. Whatever. They're incomparable, they're measured using common unit -- percent efficacy. exactly, EU (EMA) researched found there's reason concern. many individual EU non-EU countries Europe done things above.

On top AZ makes low number vaccination might set germany back couple days. likely won‚Äôt get sick come matter? Sending vaccines somewhere else breaking contract. AZ sending vaccines belonged eu Australia Yes yes. get it. 70% efficacy vaccine good 95% efficacy vaccine. I'm stupid understand 70%=95%. 

Or maybe 70% vaccine would 95% efficacious different testing conditions, disregard 25 point delta numbers understand science. 

Here's bottom line: either J&amp;J 25% less efficacious numbers meaningless. use numbers mean nothing -- confusing. That's point. Like, understand might want 75% $1000 US dollars 95% 1000 Iraqi dinar, that's really analogous. entire ""percent efficacy"" stupid afaik.

Nether Trump Biden involved. irony situation operation warp speed, conducted trump (but him, obviously) deserves credit much happened (plus scientists it). staggeringly incompetent virus can't even take credit work done, much would like to. PEI got numbers wrong, Dutch Australian studies suggest ~4x natural occurance CVST. Fully agree. also add whether trials performed areas that, trial, high prevalence variants concern. Brazilian, say that, scientific data back it, us know reinfection cases (I also know least one).

Also, many soccer players reinfected (those get tested regularly here).

Hard believe cases infection, specially spread other. science nerd Hilda Bastian table accurate. Pfizer Moderna trials focused symptomatic covid primary measure severe covid secondary measure(severe ‚â† hospitalized). seek measure hospitalizations part trials. 

However real world data hospitalisation Pfizer AZ UK vaccine rollout, far robust trials weeks first doses Pfizer BioNTech Oxford AstraZeneca vaccines administered risk hospitalisation covid-19 fell 85% (95% confidence interval 76 91) 94% (95% CI 73 99), respectively. Ah, yes.

Waiting different vaccine simply sensible thing do. definitely worth it? mean news PNG bad right now? ...No doesn‚Äôt. 

‚ÄúThe idea vaccines pretty much same, they‚Äôre perfect preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations death, got legs social media. USA Today op-ed former members Biden team illustrated linking data table found Twitter. Created infectious-disease doctor Monica Gandhi, showed variety trial results six different vaccines. One column rendered canary yellow‚Äî‚ÄúProtection hospitalizations/death‚Äù‚Äîand every cell read ‚Äú100%.‚Äù similar table, tweeted days earlier dean Brown University‚Äôs School Public Health, Ashish Jha, conveyed idea grid zeros‚Äîas in, zero people hospitalized, zero people dead. prominent physician researcher Eric Topol followed clinical-trial data summary featuring column 100 percents. ‚ÄúThat impressive!‚Äù wrote across top. told, posts would retweeted 15,000 times.

The data indeed suggestive encouraging idea. Based numbers far, expect vaccines provide extremely high levels protection dire outcomes. Still, don‚Äôt know high‚Äîand it‚Äôs clear won‚Äôt uniformly cause hospitalizations deaths COVID-19 disappear vaccinated people.

 
The experts understand this, course. Gandhi updating table data come in, pegs Moderna‚Äôs efficacy front 97 percent; Jha since tweeted ‚Äúnothing 100 percent ‚Ä¶ vaccines sure close‚Äù; Topol told Atlantic numbers tweet sufficient basis draw ‚Äúany determination magnitude effect,‚Äù though fact point direction ‚Äúvery encouraging.‚Äù Still, message perfection initial tables tweets spawned‚Äîthe gist, many readers, 100s zeros‚Äîhas since picked far wide, misinterpreted along way.
To grasp shaky nature particular data, it‚Äôs important remember vaccine-development process began. Last April, long pandemic began, World Health Organization set target efficacy vaccines 50 percent, options value measured. vaccine could shown reduce risk symptomatic disease, severe disease, transmission coronavirus. FDA offered similar guidance June, regulatory agencies also followed WHO‚Äôs lead. Among choices, symptomatic disease feasible, it‚Äôs common outcome one that‚Äôs easier confirm large-scale trial. outcome included asymptomatic infections would even common, screening infections would prohibitive, especially early pandemic. that‚Äôs vaccine trials designed: would try demonstrate least 50 percent efficacy respect symptomatic disease ‚Äúprimary outcome.‚Äù

 
The trials could used severe disease, hospitalization, death primary outcomes, would slowed things down. events far infrequent‚Äîthere could 200 infections COVID-19 death U.S.‚Äîand means would taken time, larger numbers trial participants, generate enough data sure 50 percent efficacy. Developers include ‚Äúsevere COVID-19‚Äù secondary outcome‚Äîthat is, one would measured analyzed, trial might designed provide definitive answer. Efficacy hospitalization death, however, included secondary outcomes every trial.

Given fact, data can‚Äôt support claim vaccines 100 percent effective preventing serious outcomes. (Topol highlighted issue op-ed last fall New York Times.) six vaccines included dramatic data tables made rounds Twitter, clinical trials two them‚ÄîOxford-AstraZeneca‚Äôs Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs‚Äîincluded hospitalization COVID-19 secondary outcome, reported efficacy rate. clinical research one vaccine, made Novavax, hospitalization secondary outcome, trial hasn‚Äôt reported full yet. (On website, I‚Äôve provided detailed information analysis relevant data.)‚Äù Sucks people work places starve. Please link published peer-reviewed phase 3 paper either Sinopharm Sinovac. Lol. Maybe could use sign language? God hope happens me. Covid year ago, chest heart trouble time, permanent terrible headaches every damn day almost 9 months. Got first shot today ü§ûüèª hope someone else lives got vaccine refused Nailed it! anyone cite single paper shows j&amp;j astrazeneca prevent death statistically significant way? far found none back fully? cause blood clots lol EMA, WHO, AstraZeneca bunch regulators said much. understand this, I'm sorry too. You‚Äôre clueless. Sinovac Coronavac exist. exact science definitely do, think early stages this, self reporting strong enough, would point us direction objective hard evidence. 

We can't know test without self reporting. many. think skeptics come around; latter group, probably sadly. I'm sorry, psych student kind statement baffles me. 

However may may feel mental health field, **this entire mental health field**. 

There diagnostic mental health disorder, every piece date field comes self reporting someone feels, yet even people antitherapy believe mental illness / emotional distress real. 

I also want point every single medical disorder started diagnostic. Every medical science started patient self reporting something. science went there. Keep strong. posted personally interesting me; lost taste smell April last year got back, think, October. also long term brain-fog... serious fun. I'm looking forward vaccine may mean us odd lingering symptoms nope others Headline says ""begins"" That's 25% maximum capacity allowed fire code, 25% normal.

If walked chipotle 2019 25% building capacity inside, would've turned around walked right out.

25% building capacity normal lot places. mRNA technology greatly exceeding expectations throwing shit load money research it

Goes show powerful pharmaceutical companies are; basically depending correct there's limited value delivering adrenovirus vector, example Sputnik V uses different one two doses.

To say there's value however simply incorrect, AstraZeneca example - use vector shots.

Also believe J&amp;J looking effect 2nd/booster shot, doubt they'd value literally nothing, there's probably significant diminishing returns. Send Estonia too, need bad right know big deal made vaccine plant based, read doesn‚Äôt sound *that* crazy.

It‚Äôs protein subunit vaccine far I‚Äôm aware, Novavax. Novavax grows proteins insect cells, Medicago plants 

As Quebecor though, I‚Äôd love see succeed! EU shit show right now... UK supposed approve Novavax vaccine? think US FDA wait US trial finish early may. know downvoted paper r/COVID19 says like 10-20% effective SA variant.

Basically enough people get vaccinated vaccines apparently work it, another year masks bullshit. Low-key brother planning take girlfriend drive Michigan get shot. plan changed rapidly governor announced opening everyone 29th phone trying help book appointments girlfriend soon vaccine became available found appointments posted time frame yet. Luckily actually saw Facebook leftover doses Pfizer CVS far him. told call mother call lo behold got vaccinated yesterday father (who appointment giant eagle). yesterday entire family gotten least one dose vaccine (my older brother Israel us got vaccinated leftover doses back January). Would sister law brothers wife? Likewise would still make mother law? Genuinely curious Correct. 

And people long covid say dismissed, know true witnessed comments section. 

People including doctors want believe it. shit.

My wife's parents (55+) supposed get soon fear mongering want anymore they're afraid get blood clots. super sad see live country currently one top affected sense new covid cases per 100K last 7 days :(

I, hand (29), would still take heartbeat offered statistical probability side effect low consider risk. nice covaxin too! Whole inviron prevent mild moderate symptoms, T-cell response provide protection severe symptoms hospitalisations. Crowder trash. AZ cheapest recently headlines concerning possible blood clots, reassuring. bad thing? 0.00001% chance would rejected FDA? Right...

Also, sure, maybe rush them, 'political' pressure? remember December kept getting ""should know weeks"" news, lot people saying every day FDA takes longer this, kill people.

Yet Trump can't say thing without 'political'? Please. prevent mild moderate symptoms, misleading headline old news. T-cell response provide protection severe symptoms hospitalisations. said soon older people vaccinated, goes away, true. 5% cases 30 year olds requiring hospital beds, we'd need vaccinate too. 

Basically vaccinations current hope.

It's deaths. people 90+ dying Long Term Care homes, dont add hospital situation. impossible get real numbers definition long haul covid means way separate conditions causes. 

More importantly, long haul support group (because related disease) many doctors denying happening giving patients run around reporting happening patients. 

There even patients seem fit category deny refuse believe covid all. 

*Many diseases* taken years convince medical community real solid diagnostic proof. Ex: long stomach ulcers considered stress found bacteria behind all. turned lot people suffered realized. Sleep apnea allergies even cancer tons people suffering even dying realized happening. 

We know much long covid many people knew cancer 1800s. Almost nothing. Well, thats sure. first lockdown exactly year ago, danced around year second hardcore lockdown, even worse first one. Back could GF home. today. government even explicitly stated partners living separate households forbidden seeing other. Guess relationship illegal something. 

Interesting, weve used call ""losers"" those, didnt anyone party with... wastes time. J&amp;J much faster easier utilize. J&amp;J also good shot right, again. makes immune serious illness/death greatly decreases chances illness general. people efficient possible, taking whatever shot they're given (as they're effective) community transmission go faster things get back normal. waiting 'good shot' (they're good shots) wasting time waiting, get 2 shots + two weeks takes last shot kick in. Ah, sorry realize that. local home depot 50+ stock assumed would stock locations Sinovac Sputnik V too, even though former pretty shit. 12hrs room temp vial pierced 6hr life EU things. none 30% vaccinate part 50% already it. Moderna J&amp;J made statements, need deliver.

What consequences? Literally supply? plan? 

Here‚Äôs plan: Yeah I'm working inner city number patients received vaccine count single hand, meanwhile people driving far cincinnati managed snag appointment showing largely non tech savvy client base could figure so. Could worse, UK pubs allowed open all. Yeah man hear you.

Get vaccinated. 

Then screw people. think guy crying/laughing smileys source this? Holy crap that‚Äôs long time! guess doesn‚Äôt affect effectiveness doesn‚Äôt really matter. important people get first dose half us getting doses. pretty soft lockdown begin essentially countdown herd immunity, understand frustration indefinite lockdowns like we're seeing Europe, think could've held another month two 1A+1B fully vaccinated. 

And post-holiday peak show almost month Christmas, we'll know next weeks sure. want do? Hide numbers rug? know recommendations made medical experts Norway example, politicians. 

I also find hilarious situation way hysterical subreddit Norway, public discussion actually somewhat level headed. close 1/3 next week would say.

So amazing think Yes, need lessen burden health care system? Exactly, less people die. think healthcare system save people dying? end deaths, COVID causes either old die otherwise causes regular care make room COVID care, would cause people die. major vaccinations lockdowns gone. USA Europe probably back pre covid days come summer. Going despite concerns would've damaged trust **all** vaccins, AZ. Yet fear mongering articles...when ever end Trae Crowder Steven Crowder got first dose Vancouver today, told 16 weeks second dose! ""higher efficacy vaccine."" can't compare numbers press releases different definitions.

This categorically false. definitions nearly identical four studies, _the higher efficacy mRNA vaccines used stringent definition adenovirus vaccines_.

Pfizer: 95% effective preventing symptomatic case Confirmed Covid-19 defined according Food Drug Administration (FDA) criteria presence least one following symptoms: fever, new increased cough, new increased shortness breath, chills, new increased muscle pain, new loss taste smell, sore throat, diarrhea, vomiting, combined respiratory specimen obtained symptomatic period within 4 days positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification‚Äìbased testing

Moderna: 94% effective preventing symptomatic case Cases COVID‚Äë19, starting 14 days Dose 2, defined symptomatic COVID‚Äë19 requiring positive RT-PCR result least two systemic symptoms one respiratory‚ÄØsymptom.

Johnson Johnson: 66% effective preventing moderate severe COVID (72% Moderate COVID-19 defined laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 plus either one following: evidence pneumonia; deep vein thrombosis; difficulty breathing; abnormal oxygen saturation respiratory rate equal greater 20; two signs symptoms suggestive COVID-19, cough, sore throat, fever chills. Severe COVID-19 defined laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 plus evidence clinical signs rest indicative severe systemic illness, respiratory failure, shock, significant organ dysfunction, hospital intensive care unit admission death.

AstraZeneca: 62.1% effective preventing symptomatic primary objective evaluate efficacy ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine NAAT-confirmed COVID-19. primary outcome virologically confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19, defined NAAT-positive swab combined least one qualifying symptom (fever ‚â•37¬∑8¬∞C, cough, shortness breath, anosmia ageusia). ‚ÄúThe Committee also expresses concern large number people missing second dose vaccine. Committee believes serious issue virus mutating new variants COVID-19 reported different parts world,‚Äù report said.   attempt made cover maximum people early possible,‚Äù report said.  added vaccination Lakshadweep done everyone population small (around 70,000) ‚Äúthe medical facilities limited.‚Äù Usually pretty short, would say around 15 base pairs patients hospitalised though I'm expecting anything international travel year tbh get think second challenge resultant formation germinal centers clonal selection going trim anti-self memory B cells rather upping anti-CoV2 somatic hypermutation/affinity maturation process?

It's shown humoral immunity short lived antibody repertoire largely antibodies undergone limited somatic hypermutation. indicates lack selection self autoreactivity largely due lack GC formation. Mild patients better GC response still level see respiratory viruses. Even mild cases, there's thoracic LN GC low population individuals. Formation re-entry GCs following immunization without associated inflammatory response (which still mild disease overt) would eliminated autoreactive B cells. idea less directed anti-spike antibodies anti-self, which, fair enough, could be. 

It's anti-S involved here. Anti-self anything that's extrafollicular. But, reformation GCs induce cells re-enter, even targeted specifically antigen question. GCs formed vaccination ectopic GCs like found AI disorders. said, patients anti-ACE2 IgM believe may result aberrant recognition ACE2-S complex.  completely unreasonable people cytokine storm part disease course guess. 

You need anti-self antibodies induce macrophage activation syndrome SARS-CoV-2 infection. Delayed type interferon basically need get ball rolling. Essentially, within first 3 days infection, type IFN produced alveolar epithelial cells, going run issues monocyte derived macrophage infiltration lungs. occurs, pretty much guaranteed going hyperinflammatory response macrophages polarized M1 (versus tissue resident macrophages lungs polarized M2). patients mild disease even asymptomatic disease lung inflammation even realize it. uncommon see ground glass opacity lungs even asymptomatic individuals. asymptomatic individuals seem endothelial vascular cell dysfunction reason know good explanation people long-covid cases occur, vast majority cases. normal (read: sub-ICU) course infection, people seem undergo standard pattern memory B-cell evolution.

Most asymptomatic/mild cases also develop long COVID. said, there's small percent individuals low GC formation even mild disease. There's also around 7% patients flat seroconvert detectable anti-S antibodies. would interesting see outcomes populations patients whether contribute long COVID something like errant anti-aPL autoantibodies.

My hope AZ starts getting little truthful data, future license deals focus stronger candidates. wanted throw I‚Äôm sure help people... ton vaccination clinics across country doses vaccine appointments every day. travel work heard radio Ohio, Michigan Indiana. live Florida today able get first dose (I‚Äôm 29) clinic asking people call friends family didn‚Äôt throw doses. 

I would advise anyone wants dose find local vaccine location contact see doses left 1-2 hours close. doses going waste around country faster everyone gets vaccinated sooner get semblance normalcy. Stress/worry close getting go eat sit restaurant. variant problem.

But large cases (aus) help them. kinda owe it. long story. really blame wanting higher efficacy one though? Especially aren‚Äôt super science minded, hear 60-70% 90% obviously want higher A+ one. Education would help tremendously here. essentially nothing neutralization tests. 85% samples showed activity. 

There nothing paper indicating useful variant. placebo group severe illness either, meaningless. Pfizer BMW Emirati. Cheap questionable Chinese knockoffs Asian immigrant populations. Completely point UAE Don‚Äôt think accurate least stats AstraZeneca incorrect according Europe Covid generally. 

They avoided significant infections till now. keep hearing Arlington Snohomish county ton. read couple times get it, makes lot sense.  it‚Äôs certainly ‚Äútop line‚Äù matter sell it.

but prevents severe outcomes it‚Äôs good tool, especially poorer nations/Canada. don‚Äôt think person touched arm outside swabbing alcohol seems like extreme situation probably something try call ahead see accommodations could made it‚Äôs serious. Every state it. There's really way number people process fact they're setup makeshift clinics administer vaccines. states flying right past high risk categories going straight ages. turns increase gap doses actually increases efficacy

Does mean also increases side effects second dose? Zoom events.

As someone socially isolated child/teen spent time computer...I learned long time ago online ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù aren‚Äôt real thing. hope everyone else figured out, too. It‚Äôs right concerts, parties, weddings, church, funerals etc glowing screen, I‚Äôm tired people acting like it‚Äôs big loss. Same. physical symptoms anxiety real. Horrible something want experience again. brain fog big part it. think properly. enough data determine much reduces hospitalization.

Disappointing result though -AZ seemed imply works well E484K mutations.   seem Mis-understood. group related vaccine. COVID itself. people clotting issues covid. EU leadership inept, countries stalled turn Russia China vaccines, obedience USA. time implying we‚Äôd vaccine November. wasn‚Äôt happening. totally negligible risk covid wouldn‚Äôt subject inoculation don‚Äôt require, it‚Äôs pretty simple decision me.

As much governments tried cause physical mental health society deteriorate, care intrinsic health capable immune system doesn‚Äôt rely multitude external factors fight something virus. 

Herd immunity demonstrated places extremely significant point - don‚Äôt links many things saved sift find look. cell immunity also another thing provides protection course, widely discussed. 

Those around responsible health aware that. worry others taken care feel able so. Otherwise, isn‚Äôt obligation. Seeing life many others turned upside-down overblown situation, simply don‚Äôt energy guilted caring people quite clearly care me. 

The healthcare system overwhelming due covid simply never going happen, year obvious happen. would happened, would due failures structure, funding management, covid, least country. 

Just say vaccines successful millions, millions people actually GOTTEN virus recovered successfully. Medical intervention degree frankly unnecessary many people beginning become aware that, refreshing see. Anyone wants vaccine, awesome! trying coerce force others it, especially kind facts numbers now, inappropriate unnecessary. EU operating within 5G sphere. won‚Äôt puss people off. encouraging less ardent consider vaccination positive. poster corrected factoid AZ; apparently also symptomatic infection weekly tests

My understanding vaccine trials tested participants reported symptoms, whereas Ox-AZ tested participants weekly included positive tests accompanied symptoms. theoretically would give equivalent figure, reality I‚Äôd imagine still bias efficacy people would get mild symptoms think report whereas presented positive COVID test would.

That said, AZ doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòsuck‚Äô, it‚Äôs highly effective seems really excel promoting cell response key element protection hospitalisation. mystery pneumonia MAR 2020. one knows virus caused it. Maybe covid? Maybe not? Doesn‚Äôt really matter, almost killed me. ton lingering issues since then, cleared blue vaccine. expect it, use nebulizer daily .take steroid treatments every month able breath nice. daily inhaler. Idk care vaccine helped might‚Äôve covid, generated immune response right. helped. Hopefully people lingering symptoms mystery illness find relief too. Regardless, getting protection covid alone worth it.  That's pretty crazy. That's almost 1/80 population single day. Stay strong bud.

Congratulations living Australia honestly think last leg everyone burnt super anxious get it. totally get frustrated right thing year last line behind lot people follow rules, feel unfair first glance. However, suck bit longer understand rollout nothing deserving, simply vulnerable. Hi Jenny, disagree take here. lots good reasons take vaccine:

To protect covid

To reduce likelihood give covid loved ones

To reduce likelihood giving covid strangers, especially unable take vaccine. 

To help prevent hospitals overrun

And yes, help us able get back leading normal lives. 

The vaccines given tens millions Americans successfully. couple months, Pfizer Moderna likely move emergency use authorization fully approved. 

I hope take opportunity get vaccinated given chance. wouldn‚Äôt surprised early vaccine adopters less likely wearing masks therefore less likely catch Covid. No. husband's mom mother law. sister's husband's mom mother law. Isn‚Äôt stimulus check is? different circumstances. Pfizer Moderna lower chances contracting spreading virus. us elevated risk people home need travel work, don‚Äôt think J&amp;J cut it. give J&amp;J and, that, deny others, still take substantially higher personal risks things open back up. It‚Äôs good me, work, loved ones. everywhere US going good vaccination rates going open travel again. us would willing wait longer better vaccines need be. far I‚Äôm aware nobody giving shots asking proof, aside certain small clinics.

Overworked underpaid retail pharmacists definitely don‚Äôt give shit. Europeans still enduring restrictions months rest developed world, people may well regret casual way vaccines undermined

At moment, real problem *as opposite US* vaccine export ban. lack vaccine airports/harbour sending tons vaccine abroad. much problem vaccine coming expected pace. add delayed deliveries (especially AZ) plane full vaccine flying rest world frustrating.

Counterpoint: really maxed initial lockdown, rather half-assed, patchy one did, could reduced cases enough somewhat open little summer like Europe did. way would actual waves like many countries had, rather one continuous wave mounting deaths. That's probably one reason why, even today, countries like Germany half deaths per capita. Especially early stages, kind *is* better. Yeah gonna suck everyone disease festering communities.  immunity gradient rather threshold.

Herd immunity indeed threshold. can't little bit pregnant little bit immune, either aren't. 

Before herd immunity present, may something like ""reduced R0 due wide spread immunity"" something like that. Doesn‚Äôt get votes members New Normal campaign, see here?

My response quite keep kids system know even worse?

Pandemic. go away shows us fucked inefficient harmfull systems are.


Online teaching inherently bad, online teaching system making even worse.
Just changing back person school get rid underlying problem.

The pandemic doesnt cause problem, already there, makes worse.

So dont go back inherently bad system use time change basic problem.

Thats point, one completely missed spew bile. Would nightmare 100 times worse effect economy lives? Absolutely

We'll never know. know much various mitigation factors took helped reduce spread. much r-value reduced cutting international travel, cutting indoor dining, wearing masks, etc combination things?

The issue super complicated. We've 500k+ deaths variation things course year. Would doubling deaths collapsed hospital system? Quadrupling? one say sure either. Hell, good portion year hospitals losing money enough patients since delayed non-covid related operations. think that's something get worried about. happening, would lot ""unknown virus"" deaths usual, addition lot ""known COVID"" deaths, would got people snooping around earlier. Politicians people [Yep looks like they‚Äôre we? Could swear saw BBC reporting today German concern understandable given data, pausing vaccination investigate EMA advice (and worry UK we've experienced ~3 clotting events, non fatal, 10m vaccinated, expected general population) virus' trajectory far multi variate typically discuss NPIs much smaller piece pie comfortable but, NPIs fall within locus control likely overestimate efficacy. would argue that, like personal risk, far overestimate it. hope help, decided help feel like something.

To me, comparative differences little controllable human behavior. would suggest ideal option? Got first shot yesterday (Pfizer.) fever, annoyingly sore arm.

I warned second shot may stronger reaction, however. autonomy. consequences. Consequences exclude great many things avoid dangerous others Impose restrictions = cases go down

Loosen restrictions = cases go up

Impose restrictions = cases go back down

Loosen restrictions = cases go back up

We've playing game year now. point get lives back? It‚Äôs possibly better using disinfectant.../s Yes. Amplified capitalist market forces. two mutually exclusive. one component looking Covid cases vaccinated unvaccinated cohort found difference outcome. roughly 1500 people trial.

Not looking good AZ vaccine. Good. medical officers act properly. UK CMOs said, SA variant become dominant there's need worry. people shat US last year, dear God glad live now. think able separate objective facts subjective feelings important. Covid OBJECTIVELY gives people 'sniffles'. Imagine someone trying imply fender-bender accidents killers know someone somehow died such. 


Another example...there people died honey bee stings...but 99% people, swollen spot little while. people died, mean pretend bee stings overly deadlier.  


It true family exampkle influenced Covid, would probably tender spot, since change fact people...covid sniffles. Always? many times pregnant? I‚Äôll probably get downvoted can‚Äôt get shit sorted first we‚Äôre expected help countries? recall long ago countries laughing us virus response want charity. We‚Äôre still one worst places world covid infections deaths forgive us wanting stem bleeding first. No, using Pfizer made Belgium. seriously completely mark, suggestion utterly bizarre

Welcome world brexiters.

In UK live 40 years weaponising lies smear EU every chance got. ideologically driven issue ignoring facts reality.

There simple way look this. Certain medical regulators countries found irregularities **did job** recommending short pause investigate. Politicians saw really prickly issue talked decided want overly spook public try convey joined message strategy.

But ideal opportunity brexiters. Instead going simple correct explanation, seize that, twist say politicians across EU (and outside EU lets ignore that) coordinated force medical regulators suspend AZ vaccine sour Britain left EU ""winning"" vaccine race.

We‚Äôre anywhere close running given week next shipments arrive. Wow, even sabotaged Indian roll contractual basis. evil. Everybody hates US need help. Love see 90 days since last AZ shot? They'll screw lot developing countries shit Trying make irrelevant modern world.

It's fucking **insane** /r/coronavirus subreddit, someone calling COVID sniffles gets upvoted benefit doubt someone calling twat gets downvoted told check outrage. guys serious? living different realities?  especially silly Pfizer rapidly becoming less important rollout, large proportion Pfizer doses UK need second doses, first doses, would make blocking even worse. Eh 

Look Florida. Brazil. Sure secondary impacts nearly degree places hardcore restrictions. Old people getting sick doesn‚Äôt far reaching implications think No, enough testing relative population sizes. Also, previous waves began north (the Tri-state area March/April, upper Midwest last November December) spreading South (the Sunbelt summer December 2020/January 2021). Easier blame countries failure accept fault One tiny reason would many places you‚Äôre supposed call back get sick within 2 weeks donating. don‚Äôt screen everything, usually pull blood (someone ICU doesn‚Äôt need flu top whatever else went wrong).

Keep looking, I‚Äôm research conspiracy people. yes, guys get use doses socal does. again, socal needs more. simple one hand, we've known day one COVID would probably become endemic decades, even longer pandemic.

Brazil‚Äôs rolling coronavirus disaster threat world
Ishaan Tharoor
In tortuous course coronavirus pandemic, least one constant: Latin America‚Äôs populous nation handled well. Brazil lags behind United States coronavirus-related deaths infections. latter starting battle way pandemic; Brazil, outbreak worse ever been.

The country Tuesday reported close 3,000 deaths, spike accelerated month. past week, Brazil posted record 12,888 new deaths 467,944 new cases, according Johns Hopkins University figures. Experts warn Brazil‚Äôs hospital system brink collapse, occupancy peaking near even pushing past capacity half states country. Rather going up, daily numbers administered coronavirus tests ‚Äî key tracking stopping surge cases ‚Äî declined dramatically since December.

Part problem emergence virulent coronavirus variant Brazil, one whose rapid spread since January raised global alarm. ‚ÄúIf Brazil serious, continue affect neighborhood ‚Äî beyond,‚Äù Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general World Health Organization, warned earlier month. ‚ÄúThis Brazil. It‚Äôs whole Latin America, even beyond.‚Äù

Even communities developing greater levels immunity, uncontrolled outbreak still give rise dangerous variants ‚Äî scientists fret Brazil incubating possibly deadlier new strains. patchwork inconsistent curfews lockdowns states cities failed stave crisis many Brazilian medical workers feared would come. Doctors health officials battling rising tide.

‚ÄúPatients transferred state state ‚Äî sometimes traveling hundreds miles ‚Äî nationwide hunt hospital resources,‚Äù colleague Terrence McCoy wrote last week. ‚ÄúWithout ventilators, nurses pumped infected patients‚Äô lungs manually. Cemeteries running space put bodies. Refrigerated containers wait outside hospitals take overflow. People country dying home, unable get treatment.‚Äù

It‚Äôs impossible overlook role played Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. far-right firebrand bumbled pandemic ‚Äî famously deeming coronavirus little ‚Äúmeasly flu‚Äù year ago and, recently December, declaring outbreak reached ‚Äútail end.‚Äù contracted virus continued tout unproven remedies raged social distancing measures precautions advocated regional officials political adversaries. Bolsonaro‚Äôs watch, Brazil ‚Äúsuccumbed denialism, disorganization, apathy, hedonism medical quackery,‚Äù wrote McCoy.

In illustration chaos, Bolsonaro announced week would appointing new health minister ‚Äî country‚Äôs fourth since pandemic began. first two fell afoul president questioning leadership covid-era decision-making. third, active-duty general medical training, investigated country‚Äôs top court alleged neglect led collapse health system Amazonas state earlier year.

During briefing Tuesday, Marcelo Queiroga, cardiologist transition role health minister coming days, reiterated loyalty Bolsonaro. ‚ÄúThe president worried situation,‚Äù said.

Critics wonder that‚Äôs true. Brazil‚Äôs lack effective national coordination pandemic is, part, Bolsonaro‚Äôs fault. allies initially pushed misinformation downplaying threat virus efficacy social distancing masks. Later, Bolsonaro questioned value vaccines, stoking anti-Beijing sentiment even Chinese vaccine undergoing trials Brazil. Last October, blocked federal government plans purchase tens millions doses Sinovac vaccine.

On front, Bolsonaro fellow traveler former president Donald Trump, similarly scorned covid-era lockdowns sought blame domestic rivals, well China, woes pandemic. Last year, Trump administration also pressured Brazil obtain Russian Sputnik V vaccine population.

But Trump gone infections spiking, Bolsonaro midst humiliating about-face. government announced last week ordered 10 million doses Russian vaccine. go China, cap hand, request tens millions doses Chinese vaccine, well raw materials mass produce Brazilian soil.

‚ÄúChina spent months batting away resentment distrust place pandemic began, recent weeks diplomats, pharmaceutical executives power brokers fielding scores requests vaccines desperate officials Latin America, pandemic taking devastating toll grows day,‚Äù noted New York Times. ‚ÄúBeijing‚Äôs ability mass-produce vaccines ship countries developing world ‚Äî rich countries, including United States, hoarding many millions doses ‚Äî offered diplomatic public relations opening China readily seized.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Brazil‚Äôs turbulent domestic political scene, Bolsonaro‚Äôs mismanagement presented new opening main rival. Former leftist president Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva scorned Bolsonaro‚Äôs ‚Äúmoronic‚Äù handling crisis. ‚ÄúThis country state utter tumult confusion there‚Äôs government,‚Äù Lula declared last week, lamenting lives could saved warning ‚Äúcovid taking country.‚Äù

Brazil‚Äôs medical workers desperately trying prevent happening. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying help people disease much faster aggressive tactics we‚Äôve using,‚Äù Andr√© Machado, infectious-disease specialist city Porto Alegre, told Guardian. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like we‚Äôre flogging dead horse. disease going kill many people Brazil.‚Äù very, very, AZ vaccines. Refusal AZ non-issue whole sub filled articles comments european countries stopping AZ political reasons despite fact politician involved stopping AZ-vaccines, decision several health agencies statistically significant cases popping up. vaccine nationalism coming british american users absolutely detrimental, Norway Sweden ""political qualms"" UK based company they're severely behind vaccinating population. Miss bullshit. call european experts, political interference, take political decisions unless political motives shoot countries. all. never said mental health issues disappear night. improve disease controlled? Absolutely.

People less afraid catching virus. People connected social support systems again. People able engage normal leisure activities.

Everyone won‚Äôt go back normal right away, course. don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre pretending mental health crisis occur ‚Äúwhen over.‚Äù mental health crisis happening NOW. anything, recovery start over. September 30.... massive winter surge increased big related specific vaccine hardly of. Europe saved Pfizer, moderna J&amp;J. you‚Äôre actively silencing wrong type evidence, saying there‚Äôs significant statistical evidence. 

Got it. located? Walmarts area it, release new appointments every midnight. They‚Äôre pretty easy get. Yeah, use right we're pandemic stage. Safety effectiveness testing took time needed see vaccine safe effective, speeding production taking time first mass-produced mRNA vaccine ever approved public use. Governments throwing boatloads money already, finishing safety tests building manufacturing lines took time.

&amp;#x200B;

By time virus moves ""from pandemic endemic"" Pfizer's execs saying, production lines already scaled up. amount vaccine pump per day already much higher. increase price point, it'll profit preventing future outbreaks, we'll already done current outbreak. dangerous part is, price vaccine high developing countries, virus end taking root developing countries, killing people healthcare systems, giving room new strains develop could resistant vaccines now. agree that, either. I'm legalization drugs basis I'm forced vaccinations.

It's perfect example, though. scenario, person forbidden putting something body, forced something put body. think that's important difference. Like, imagine let cops inject THC. would super interesting, lol, extremely fucked up. Every report I‚Äôve read vaccinated individual getting infected either minor symptoms. Every FDA EUA vaccine US 100% hospitalization death prevention.

Basically got sick enough full vaccination require hospitalization, you‚Äôd news story, hasn‚Äôt happened anyone else date. Good thing didn‚Äôt offer opinion then, mentioned state affairs area.  LA ""one city."" massive chunk state. said, that's exactly asked insisting experience experience. guysnin Central CA also compliance issues day one much politically motivated. believe anything varients people complying. fully expect see cases increasing things opening up, again, yet. would like see info increases Central CA it, though. 

As France, Germany, Italy; planning shutting preemptively. Brazil whole monster MASSIVE virus denial problem. cases comperable we're experiencing states, let alone locally. la times vaccine tracker? right here: see bay area gets uses far doses per capita socal does, like source says, socal needs vaccines norcal edited post. Nice technique. LOL country India little better vaccination front. important knows (the still popular) Bolsonaro failed people totally. see evidence vaccine centres 'begging people' come inside. true least one country would open appointments everyone, haven't.

The rhetoric makes sound like angry teenager rather adult cogent point, even though overall point view seems reasonable. Nationalise. Immediately. wasn‚Äôt talking California.

The return normal won‚Äôt fix everything, course. lot people‚Äôs current issues come restrictions.

&amp;#x200B;

Didn't seem matter countries like Poland results tests promising many EU countries could actually distribute cold vaccines... cater lowest common denominator. case, disaster waiting happen, considering mRNA vaccines pretty much saviour here. 

&amp;#x200B;

So contracts signed late , little vaccine, seemingly little forethought they, manufacturers, would make enough stuff time. 

But guess happy contract nutcases Poland Bulgaria would sign onto... magically thought vaccine would made time. plan get vaccine myself. businesses require proof vaccine, choice. think government (in US least) authority force get vaccinated, think violation person's human rights so. problem. world‚Äôs problem. need come together one global nation vaccinate Brazil! think mustve ignored post. bay area served compared rest state. everyone else needs vaccines Hope get some, Belgium Eastern Europe ones vaccinating right (with AZ) Missed it...by much. live Brazil, news talk since march 2020, president negationist, forth health minister quit get fired agree president.

Sure vaccine made Oxford I'd take care less whether British, German American company made it

Very people want see EU fail vaccinations I'd imagine feeling mutual Europe, nobody vendetta guys, fully everyone protected

The reason criticised risk incredibly remote compared risk covid quite possible even connected cost alot trust vaccine program general

Here UK we'll soon knocking door 50% adult population vaccinated people dying blood clots mass. reported 2 vaccines (of people dying blood clots) 13 AZ 15 Pfizer stopped Pfizer well? expected, Ministry Health said multiple times Easter peak 3rd wave.

The problem Poland virus people breaking restrictions. politicians inability admit wrong. illogical decisions. willingness opress people. Nobody listens restrictions anymore, 'underground' parties every big city, ""food workshops"" sign document free dine inside restaurant. People finding ways obey restrictions see politicans corrupted ones showing us way care well. USA EU's incompetence? Sanofi French, AZ British, Pfizer German.

And there'd real way measure aside from, say, identical twins one received vaccine another not.

I‚Äôd recommend looking Vaccine Hunters Philadelphia Pennsylvania group Facebook. Florida Vaccine Hunters group really helped family out. loss confidence Astrazeneca vaccine unjustified, according survey. Two-thirds willing vaccinated want continue receiving vaccine. majority respondents \[54%\] also believe vaccination freeze responsible.  question whether would also vaccinated Astrazeneca vaccination ban lifted answered affirmative 63% willing vaccinated. One-third respondents said would prefer receive vaccine. Confidence vaccine particularly high among respondents would get vaccinated immediately (71%).  age also plays remarkably large role acceptance Astrazeneca. Among 18- 29-year-olds, vast majority (71%) say also want vaccinated vaccine. lowest acceptance Astrazeneca still 58% among 45- 59-year-olds. \[...\] depends person though, people perfectly fine like 102. 

But yeah, right choose.  someone already covid mostly mild symptoms risk serious illness, second sentiment. see international travel opening without vax requirements skip two week house arrest.

Plus dad able hang together year now.

Plus, enough enough now! Brit here. vaccine last week. asked one getting going arm. 

A jab arm worth 1000 shelf.

No side effects apart hope optimism. know vaccine give covid.

What understand two shots get infected covid, contagious others, infectious you, etc. either JJ's shot one shot mRNA vaccine 100% effective avoiding serious illness seems like decent amount protection me, personally, really want feel sick two days second shot, stats wise far likely outcome individual like getting covid (mild illness).

BUT affect risk spreading covid someone else? 66% (or whatever chart says, hopefully get point) effectiveness mean 34% chance getting sick getting sick infectious others infectious others? want I'd get second shot case... know know anyone knows variant hammered vaccine Anyone know calculate reduced check ? Online calculators say 500~600 AGI 78k got $380 baby born different repeat post, seems discussions explicit rule 4 violations. Many, many people careful entire year. weeks bother them. wife I, personal health important ""going back normal"". would rather never get COVID, never long term disabilities it, even means weeks careful. correct. Antibodies transferred baby form passive immunization. antibodies last forever. cells also involved. answer baby stay immune life. Probable combination right thing do, wanting avoid bad PR, wanting avoid governments implement emergency measures seize product (which 100% would happened). also understand talking about

It's terrible euthanasia legal. Sorry, conflating anti-lockdown sentiments extremist political motives itself? half year several European countries, can't chained homes social interaction sense community economic stability long. Again, favors here. already mentioned team effort. US money went research, EU money went building factories, researchers' education etc. whole point solely European US effort. point make sense. cannot simply say America's vaccines exists suggested first comment.

Also see link info EU funding (if actually interested):  Conservatives balance budgets, decrease debts

That‚Äôs lie tell followers.  I‚Äôm from, conservatives gut revenge increase debts.... agree markets need regulated.

However, also think it‚Äôs worth noting Pfizer one company turned OWS funding development manufacturing. make arguably best product, vaccine first approved, highest production rates/are reason many vaccinated now.

It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpure‚Äù free market, would still argue example success free market system profit motivated countries.

Pfizer also said going keep (very reasonable, IMO) pricing pandemic over. point, society returned relative normalcy, COVID vaccine treated differently vaccine? much ‚Äúdefault walking speed‚Äù tied fitness, though? example, would consider fit fast walker. example, go walk, I‚Äôll sweaty kind breath get back. go walk someone else, I‚Äôm totally fine I‚Äôm forced walk slower. try walk slower pace own, however, feels like actual torture. honest, always kind thought walking speed like trait buried deep inside us quickly walk vs crap cardio. Ah, see. You‚Äôre troll. Well feel better knowing people aren‚Äôt actually stupid. lot change April 29. Maybe get pushed earlier, especially neighboring states well infection rate super low. I‚Äôm Shawano County posted last night saying received expected open appointments. It‚Äôs great. Look out! There's tiger charging you! Fortunately, two rifles table front you. One rated 70% effecacious stopping tigers, rated 95% effecacious. But, worry pick, they're probably same, assign numerical percentages based incomplete, non-standardized testing. governments making initial vaccine purchases passed significant trials. Pfizer leverage charge insane price. could 10 successful, cheaper vaccines, case would told fuck off. 

The reason Pfizer even consider enough cheaper vaccines. AZ largest western player possible supply whole globe, Pfizer western trusted vaccine come high priced product sell meet demand. 

If AZ like vaccines, Pfizer would probably relegated US due pricing. Governments unfortunately unlimited budgets already half broken due government debt fund crisis. posted days ago lol. big deal go movies. Stop following subject news. 
If media suddenly started reporting deaths, many ppl would believe world ending. 

But reality, much happening. Nothing remotely affects life. 
You notice 'crisis' authorities overreacting. also can‚Äôt consent regular vaccines medical procedures going preschool eating vegetables. Yet happens every day. Parents serve proxy-consent well past children actually make decisions, makes sense provide consent children can‚Äôt. Conservatives balance budgets, decrease debts

Since when? That‚Äôs lie tell followers.  I‚Äôm from, conservatives gut revenge increase debts.... vaccinating 50k/day 65+ slowed down, open next phase

Because supply rate increasing. vaccinating rate today yesterday failing. Full stop. 

It made sense vaccinate elderly first - overwhelmingly population could benefit MASSIVELY focused protection. diminishing returns. 

Right elderly, shooting herd immunity. get faster end sooner, Covid less chance mutate. minority good society, HUGE. outweighs every criteria (after protecting elderly). point thing matters vaccination schedule openings. schedule 100% full, screwed big time, slowed race biggest goal, errored side opening categories. goal reach total number people, slows spread.

Somehow got mentality order matters matters getting herd immunity. doesn‚Äôt. Every person gets vaccine 1 day sooner slows infection rate everybody infected. 

Everybody needs stop worrying order, distraction. 

The time rushing us quickly percentage population either anti-vaccination, lazy get line keep vaccination schedule full. Nobody totally sure exact percentage reach herd immunity, one recent article said 70% vaccinated, let‚Äôs use example. get 60% lines dwindle sitting unused vaccine, LOSE. get across finish line 71% even 75% slam dunk bury thing 80% win big. That‚Äôs goal, goal humble opinion, order longer important. Group 4 listed immediately phase 3 link provided Can't wait available everyone. vaccine way, gotta continue open up. late 40s think, I'm close her, sister's friend I've heard her.

My sister disagreed behavior. Haha literally grain salt tho XD

but yeah, acid reflux serious mess up, that's encourage people see doctor rather trying home remedies even self-treating antacids keeps happening. understand happening symptoms typical, ended shortness breath tachcardia sorts terribly side effects damaging lungs. Lung damage anybody wants 2021! Keep mind many people US vaccinated 65. means even see rise cases, see anywhere near rise hospitalizations death before. K. cool almost mothers IgG antibodies transmitted fetus transplacentally. last months protect babies immature immune system go away. basically isn‚Äôt really surprising, would exciting somehow covid antibodies persisted long period time. Well that‚Äôs EU completely mismanaged every step vaccination 

The original claims variants would render vaccines obsolete That's wrong. vaccines given France last weeks AstraZeneca.

That's COMPLETELY wrong. **Most vaccines** given France last weeks AstraZeneca.

Pfizer dosing SLOWED. 

[See Without AZ France FUCKED. must done voted bored troll. We're trying serious discussions here. Find somewhere else dumb. knew pretty quickly rate thrombosis vaccinated individuals got Astrazenaca line rate occurrence general population. 

Despite that, countries happily put people's lives danger statistical insignificance. complete ineptitude. ‚ÄòWe mad failed people thus blame others countries getting *checks notes* 2.2% total needed vaccines!‚Äô That's wrong. vaccines given France last weeks AstraZeneca.

Pfizer dosing SLOWED.

[See Cases likely never go 0. people say, ""I try think healthcare workers died covid makes depressed."" like disrespectful thing possibly say. sorry someone's death trying save lives emotionally inconvenient.

You thinking it. Every day. thankful it. also, try help change situation part. Screw selfish people expect pain suffering something best ignored completely. adding acid acid balance PH stomach?? personal experience quite opposite, antacid (alkaline) worked that's adding alkaline acid does. someone explain mechanism here, I'm sure woo, many uses apple cider vinegar are. one spouting nonsense EU nationalistic propaganda here.

Pfizer paid 100% costs development Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

Back April 2020, Pfizer BioNTech announced partnership Pfizer paid 100% development costs. Agreement Germany comes September 2021, time already successful candidate conducting late stage trials. German money spent actual development vaccine, Pfizer money.

Any German money BioNTech may received vaccine went ""market authorization"" (applying license) manufacturing facilities (which came online back February 2021). Source 1 (April 2020):

  ‚ÄúWe already started working Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine pleased announce details ongoing collaboration, reflects companies‚Äô strong commitment move quickly bring safe efficacious vaccine patients worldwide,‚Äù says Co-Founder CEO BioNTech, Ugur Sahin, M.D.

  terms agreement, Pfizer pay BioNTech $185 million upfront payments, including cash payment $72 million equity investment $113 million. BioNTech eligible receive future milestone payments $563 million potential total consideration $748 million. Pfizer BioNTech share development costs equally. Initially, Pfizer fund 100 percent development costs, BioNTech repay Pfizer 50 percent share costs commercialization vaccine.

Source 2: September 2020

  funding important contribution accelerate development scaling-up COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing capacities Germany. highlights tremendous importance mission efficiently find lasting solution control pandemic,‚Äù said Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO Co-founder BioNTech.

So German money used factory Marburg developing vaccine.

Source 1: 2: Using percentages literally way look else every fight every disease I‚Äôm history failure. Rabies? failed 2 families lose loved one every year. flu? failure nearly 30,000 families lose love one. Polio? Another failure 1 family loses loved one every year. see stupid statement is? Lol 

Scientists look statistics keeps less educated discrediting good work via ‚Äúthink family‚Äôs‚Äù ‚Äúone death many‚Äù arguments. Didn‚Äôt say wrong think said poll 1000 people it‚Äôs really huge sample. don‚Äôt suck financial reasons

Everyone know 50 already first jab now. parents, friends, co-workers. really moving quickly now. Covid-bola ? 5 states : Michigan / Missouri / New Jersey / New York / Rhode Island remain epicenters United States COVID-19 infections last 2 weeks... terrible 54% still ""most"", technically correct. certainly look future looking current production capabilities Moderna Biontech highly likely get doses planned. J&amp;J Curevac possibly get us even further. AZ also probably deliver couple million doses point. Getting vaccines people‚Äôs arms issue - even 2 months delays every EU country done October. Archive link: J&amp;J‚Äôs efficacy excellent severe form disease, good general. haven‚Äôt studies effects double dipping - me, wouldn‚Äôt it. Stuff like believe vaccine rollout flawed. people go socialize large groups people less frequently general get vaccine first. Many folks retired, therefore contributing less economy younger.

A better fair approach would put people groups based upon birthday randomly select group receive vaccine next 1-2 weeks (based supply) via lottery, i.e. Contagion method. get random (well completely, close) subsets populations vaccinated once, allows things start reopening safely. 

Plus take account groups younger people lifelong health complications due catching virus. another pandemic hits, folks likely put 1B group, already large subset population, thus increasing wait time next vaccine. sure mean I've taken Nasal Spray influenza vaccine past. FluMist name want google it. main issue see numbers 20% part 33%. Also long antibodies last, people infected year ago. concern uk variant turned really overstated despite fearmongering headlines

Considering it‚Äôs kind butt fucking Europe right now, that‚Äôs true all. Uh, already involve ton socialist policies America. companies invest money vaccines don‚Äôt make profit? Hahahaha amazing! /r/AteTheOnion immunity black white, ""suddenly gone"" type thing.

Of course still outbreaks measels, etc., say herd immunity, high level herd immunity. 

The MMR vaccine much stronger effective long-term COVID vaccines are. typically require booster shots MMR every year two measels mutating quickly efficiently COVID seems take 90%, people recovered least immunity. Estimates vary widely.

I've seen estimates 80%-90%, personally Ok. I'll loan $5 condition loan $5 back. Step 1: lockdown world save lives 80 year olds sacrificing lives mental health young people, addition shitty economy, degree inflation, housing situation find 80 year olds. 

Step 2: rather give vaccine young people sacrificed most, actually give last.

Step 3: expect young people happy played out. It‚Äôs satire site, unless happens spinning comedy gold next article coincidentally Republican boycott potatoes. Could be. least vaccines brought New Guinea take care problem. Like Polio vaccine Cuba's lung cancer vaccine?

pm ship Nobel. called cooperation. sides give take, everyone profit. (I think said something like ""roads open directions""?) Sounds ""sue"" proof.
I agree. least look real world results first likely UK also get doses there.

Well possible, UK seems nearing end 40 million order. time new plant opens finished. Let start saying wear mask 100% compliance law and/or venue‚Äôs rules. 

That said, wearing mask sucks. go beach four friends, aren‚Äôt shoulder-to-shoulder like would concert protest. 4 feet away, circle, chatting amongst sun, wind, humidity - kills virus. Communication mask difficult. lot expressions nonverbal, read lips think. 

I don‚Äôt need mask beach. summer beaches NY NJ normal capacity. one wearing masks, zero uptick cases attributable beach. 

People receptive restrictions based results reason. Wearing mask indoors grocery store helps, it. tell people ‚Äúit cut transmission basically impossible more-basically impossible,‚Äù likely say fuck question everything say. medical professional, Moderna CEO would expected use cautious language like this, although probably could phrased better he'd bit think it, e.g. ""We've looked data we've collected prior work, found anything concerning far"". That's forgivable speaking interview want spend lot quiet time phrasing things so.

The journalist time world choose headline, used time poorly.

I get want give false impression trial absolutely succeed, here's examples could worked:

- Vaccine safety problems expected children, says Moderna CEO.
- indications vaccine safety issues children far, says Moderna CEO. someone help understand findings study? 5 days ago effectiveness masks mandates looking large scale data. know they're looking average transmissions, basically, could 1.8% decrease overall average heavy lifting mask mandates (or policies) establishing bring transmissions face factors driving cases like early opening, poor executions, etc. study effect virus handled Public Health standpoint? 

&amp;#x200B;

It really touch effectiveness transmission viruses face mask wearing though sound science? saying society averaged 1.8% decrease virus cases time interval mask mandates openings present. agree pointing out. really sad think thousands businesses across country went pandemic, titans like Disney overwhelmingly able ""weather storm.""

People love complain wealth gap corporations seem everything America. last year made pretty apparent keeps happening. UK already vaccinated important part population, fine little less Pfizer vaccines...they already get lots vaccines AstraZeneca they'll start getting Moderna doses April...the goal ""rich"" countries save summer tourism rise high almost back normal levels.

The US blocks exports COUNTRIES UK blocks exports...I think right export doses countries production facility: happy this, increase it.

I hope export affects rich countries (Australia, UK, Canada, China) poor ones zero manufacturing capacity gave definition word. one insulted offended. 2016, people sick politically correct jerks like you. Go jump building mad world.  reported¬†28,903 new COVID-19 cases, 17,741 recoveries 188 deaths last 24 hours, Union Health Ministry informed March 17, 2021. highest single-day spike fresh infections taken India's total COVID case tally 1,14,38,734, includes 2,34,406 active cases 1,10,45,284 recoveries. number fatalities due COVID-19 stands 1,59,044 across COVID-19 cases continue upward swing India, Prime Minister Narendra held meeting Chief Ministers states stressed need take measures check spread the¬†second peak said need quick decisive actions control situation. added last weeks, 70 districts country reported 150 percent surge Covid cases ""if stop here, situation nationwide outbreak come up."" Kurwa mac, indeed 21.7% received least one dose yesterday‚Äôs CDC numbers, lag day. EU shambles Pretty sure latest estimates around 80% Covid cases mild. Deaths steadily 1% so. either way much, much higher 0.5% suggest.

Again, we're talking lethality. talking moderate severe cases merely ""sniffles"". EU threatening block Pfizer exports UK. Totally agree, seems element shame keeps jumping different areas whole pandemic, group people get vaccines aren‚Äôt somehow anti-vax selfish something...there shortage broad brushes characterize folks past year nuance seems window. China currently foreign vaccines approved? words issue allowing foreign vaccines one allowing approved vaccines right sinovac? 
(Assuming US EU ever start limit travel based vaccination status, probably consider sinovac vaccine either, approved...) alternative public health messaging sucked ass. think average person interprets ""two weeks flatten curve""? realize Serbia different country Bosnia, no? man's gotta eat point used term ""always"" constantly pregnant gone pregnancy vaccine routine boatload times, disagreeing sentiment. defend behavior - call illegal legal, gyms closed, like bars restaurants indoor dining - open get fined. however judges rule, supporting assholes trying keep shit closed people dying.

don't downplay pandemic almost 50,000 people died already. thank you. Okay, countries ban export vaccine components EU needs make vaccine first spot. what? Another dumb move EU trying cover failings. PA still 1A... It‚Äôs logical all. EU resident I‚Äôm ashamed Ursula. clearly designed hide mistakes commission people blame UK rather commission. non-EU people assure Ursula bureaucratic monster popular within Union outside. Lol? RI get whole population like, mid-May earliest something. April right we'd expected. could always learn word means see modern China fits definition.

Is real lmfao?  Herd immunity black white, ""suddenly gone"" type thing.

There still outbreaks measels, etc., say herd immunity, high level herd immunity. 

It take 90%, people recovered least immunity. Estimates vary widely. Europe? assume? curfews wrong imo. glad never here.

but give shit business closures. fool would go public indoor space non essential reason right said ""vaccine producing countries ahead EU member states"" ... like else aimed at? specific hits 2 countries.  literally vaccinating people. end sight. lost loved one Covid. asking don‚Äôt kill people get line shot. eat inside Denny‚Äôs soon enough. kept US. JnJ moved fill finish step Germany. JnJ completely produced EU. export ban would prevent US getting doses. see Astra, upvote quotes impossible decipher. ngl, i'm kinda fond term bludclart Jonas Salk thinks shitty take. prepared feel like shit getting 2nd dose Pfizer vaccine ended feeling absolutely nothing. rather anticlimactic lol. people get side effects, people don't. worry much clear schedule next day case. one makes sense people apparently learning difficulty put mask abortion ban nothing lockdown. realsies time, promise. And?

Doesn't change fact J&amp;J looking place outside US move fill finish production.

The idiot German health secretary Jens Spahn even said scared doses would get intercepted US authorities. account seems ""UK bad, EU good"" posts. Ignore it. Yeah, source bit vague concerns sound unbelievable me. even possible export finished vaccine products US currently? Pfizer AZ really make difference. need terms ""doses"" much brand. dont' think numbers available (indirectly second doses needed minus ones already UK), probably even important, since strengthening EU's negotiating power.

They've waited Marburg plant coming online, domestic fill&amp;finish J&amp;J ensured sufficient lipid production inside EU. never thought I'd see someone suck pharm company's dick.

Remember companies (including Pfizer) opiates?  Fuck 'em, nationalize asses. subreddit usually bit better reading articles like this, I'm bit surprised response I'm seeing it. suddenly grim issue actually read article. Bludclarts would good death metal band name. PA resident parents FL residents. IMO Florida handled everything testing/vaccines/lockdowns much better PA. Pa plan shut everything down. 70 yo parents lived pa would still fighting vaccine. know weather plays role honestly even ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù knew far people PA winter Covid parents knew wide open Florida.  anyone truly answer we‚Äôd know   UK set receive around 17m doses Moderna vaccine spring, manufactured Spain Switzerland. blocked too?  missing point. 

Berlin gave BNT 400M. rest EU give BNT? 

EU 450M people gave BNT 400M
US 330M people gave Sanofil (who failed) 400M

The US gave Moderna well billion. 

Note: none figures include actual purchasing vaccines rather front development production costs. That‚Äôs I‚Äôve noticed. It‚Äôs large, Republican states seem rapidly expanding access (and lagging behind country). Wallgreens ha great scheduling system.

It broken week colorado. also wrong eligibility criteria. Also doctors offices giving patients come whatever. Maybe come shot.

This definitely long term strategy. people go doctor twice year, maybe even that. one fence getting going sign go mass vax site

Absolutely agree. still 80-100M people fence this. never happen ... least stage. People tired lifestyle, especially Americans see restrictions threat freedom. Downvote want, live USA know majority people worn pandemic set target date normal summer, included. cant keep Pssst vaccine. early stages everyone get yet. like end June everyone able get it. wait eat Denny‚Äôs go get shot? Maybe get fucking pancakes go? output bottled Belgium, supplies UK. Great, never. public health policy relies 100% cooperation everyone fantasy, solution. Science stop taking actual human behavior account? saw contract.

The factories UK included. paid 'EU' money.

They produce around 2million doses week anyway. Even whole lot exported, leaving UK nothing, make dent EU's shortfall.

The whole thing pathetic deflection tactic. Public health recommendations, like could packed multigenerational families together Christmas, would selfish fool. Government isn‚Äôt able reign stupid. Well that‚Äôs point. disconnect social/political circle happening rest state, wonder is. E.U blocks elderly ppl getting second dose- god would bad look

UK delivering AZ 50-75yo europeans looking nice either, TBF. gf became eligible yesterday state scheduled shot tomorrow. Georgia, Governor kemp said they‚Äôre seeing vaccine hesitancy among white republicans  look Bludclarts

The Jamaican informal usage worth effort googling it. They‚Äôd probably also stop Pfizer exported UK.  rarely talk nowadays, do, usually tell exactly said. got covered. pay

There if. don't. Nice kidding, actually worse Trump this. Pfizer issue here, AZ delivering due requesting approval Dutch factory. everyone know~

thats problem market value lifesaving drugs. Healthcare human right, prices controlled government, medicine given people need it. 

Just like firefighters. wonder market value putting flames are, government handles it.  Actually, plant got spare capacity another different vaccine got delayed 4 months. J&amp;J would rather ship things across ocean twice.  one thing, one guy Reddit claiming long Covid exaggerated media, studies claim 2-3% people infected issues. 

We yet shown studies, don‚Äôt even know exist, don‚Äôt know methods used studies nobody provided them. helps Bosnia Serbia lot vaccines? article says canton Bosnia 50,000.

Why focus one canton one month focus whole country three, looking good data?

Every vaccine, matter efficacy, likely reduce transmission strain number vectors. 

Being good vaccines, bad policy social/institutional trust, solve itself. 

There's lot cruel commentary Reddit days Europe suffering spikes vaccinating.

Here's country who's vaccination game strong heading absolutely abysmal state. 

Don't think it'll one either, vaccines one tool, tool, stop spread. aunt lost life. 53 healthy. close. missed birth first grandchild.

More damaging maybe you.   Yeah, likely official definition--but think part 2 logical premise comment would need true. Otherwise, would talking kinds ""natural disasters"" people *can* affect. lightning-caused fires wildland-urban interface. (directly) caused humans, fight save lives.

And problem. know common sling insults online, immune inherently high emotions around issue. need speak clearly times like these, name-calling helpful.

I believe some, all, jurisdictions mask mandates operating authority previous laws gave power. However, would mind seeing mask-mandate ability explicitly encoded law, rather falling umbrella public-health emergency powers. fact, think would downright good idea, since know masks likely important future pandemics. Hope enjoying Dutch German vaccines bud. Darwin. would say analysis leaves JNJ vaccine less frequent side effects. one shot. platform used ebola even pregnant women. JNJ vaccine lot going it. 

I would argue undersold amazingly awesome Pfizer vaccine is. 94% asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections beyond amazing. think say amazing enough times. Amazing Amazing analysis derived de-identified aggregate Israel MoH surveillance data collected January 17 March 6, 2021, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccine available country transmissible B.1.1.7 variant SARS-CoV-2 (formerly referred U.K. variant) dominant strain. Vaccine effectiveness least 97% symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, severe critical hospitalizations, deaths. Furthermore, analysis found vaccine effectiveness 94% asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. outcomes, vaccine effectiveness measured two weeks second dose. Look up. famous guy feels way you. wrote book two. includes Pfizer Yeah, government allows vaccine distributed credible reasons suspect might contamination potentially dangerous production issue (and turns actually is) risk undermining public trust government ensure people get safe vaccines *any* brand potentially even non covid vaccines.

For reason, think cost benefit calculus fundamentally different extremely rare awful side effects vs quality control issues. Nobody expects every super rare side effect come light right away brand new (in pre-covid vaccine years) vaccine that's distributed different people entire world definitely expect government make sure get something manufactured safely. huge hint: opened slots ANYONE who's ""medically qualified"", verification needed. feel need shot risk due job exposure, pre-existing condition, go ahead sign up.

I'm afraid national numbers look pretty 'good' trends largely California well Florida enter covid heavy season.

We're also fairly significant chunk testing, absolute number remains high, also think like holidays, people opting test get away spring break.

We're seeing pretty convincing spikes various areas around country % wise, Michigan already nearing 8%.

If another major wave hit Cali tomorrow (very unlikely), Texas (more likely, offended Lone Stars) national numbers start looking really scary.

Hope I'm wrong, 1:100000 keeps dropping predicted would higher now, I'd happy wrong again. I've eaten twice since getting second shot 3 weeks ago, times outdoors. Last time March 8, 2020.

Also category earlier phase age 50+ grocery workers, people 2 co-morbidities. really risky those? oddly specific category. Hooray, stalkers Biologika found someone wants vaccine filled vials them. 

The subsidies wasted. girlfriend PI. unlike USA (that I'm from), people fed restrictions ready get life.

It's one thing ask everybody stay home weeks totally different matter still expect kind compliance full effin year later.

Sadly, PI Rich country vaccination barely taking off. sister healthcare worker got first shot (Sinovac) barely week ago. Meh, almost every nurse find one easily it‚Äôs even worth thinking about. Yes.

I call heroes 'forced' something parents. Yeah need quit checking state's daily. number really matters end hospitalizations deaths. actual number cases going take long time drop. Page 21. 

Pfizer also known BNT162b2.... documents 100% covid free due antibodies. red text, safe Covid. I'm IQ expert trust IQ sub skyrocketed past several months. let get plane cross border? curiosity, got blood clots covid, many developed clot hospitalized covid symptoms many 'fine' covid clot appeared? exact numbers what's vibe? 1/3rd Americans inoculated 1st dose. Keep up. Daily data looks like it‚Äôll late. Cases ~4.5k week ago, deaths ~640 week ago, hospitalizations ~200 day Nope, reference Pfizer file link. Oh god, that's right. took doses they're even using all. people absolutely raging? recently J&amp;J insistent last production step must happen United States. witnessing small win EU finally secure doses? say but...vaccines wouldn‚Äôt gotten this.

But would helped. Especially since they're still vaccinating vulnerable populations. take weeks actually impact.

This wave going days. AZ vaccines would absolutely made impact.  Damn thought CT (my state) taking W opening 16+ April 5  Unfortunately people advised due health reasons (severe allergy) take vaccine. relative position. Hopefully able future.

Interesting... Many cited platelet thing major factor made AZ-associated events uniquely concerning. hasn't. experimented with. understand getting downvoted, happened Europe too, downward trend suddenly explosion variants took over.

Hopefully amount people vaccinated US right enough slow spread states. original post, said seen sub offering less perfect debate subject. exactly, said sub committing mostly fallacies \[as antivaxxers\]

You answered comparison antivaxxers laughable.

I offered example thinking conspiracy minded comment, well upvoted, shows similarity kind arguments used think saying ""we suspend use AZ vaccine"" makes bad antivaxxer?

Of course not. comment asking better debate rather offhand dismissal, understand unless specific background, probably avoid ""back envelope"" math guess vaccine safety. important check ones biais. Like sub, pro-vaccine despise antivax movement. Also, really want situation end. might make little less objective require little attention toughts claim things beyond properly established, dismiss new information hastily. imagine potential shame regret moron quite high here, given currently low risk covid young. would also affect future vaccine uptake real danger wouldn‚Äôt worry that. There‚Äôs lot if‚Äôs they‚Äôre worth getting overly paranoid spending life living like indefinitely. here, I've doom-scrolling sub shouting void haha. 

I definitely see coming pissed friends getting vaccines getting hung dry. like worse form finals week college; day 1 everyone boat praying over, day 7 people gotten tests done gone home. day 4 mix people finishing unlucky ones even started yet.

And point people saying difficult, must aggravating. People understanding circumstances they've never experienced, like difficulty getting vaccine, sometimes callous :( **hard** find vaccine! Even someone dedicates day finding appointments, odds end finding anything. that's even getting cases like can't spend every waking minute looking.

There better way roll vaccines. Every town list citizens, plop vaccination site every town's soccer field high school gym get things done fast. grandma drive 45 minutes get shot. well, covid around longer vaccines... major downside forced unwilling people, full stop. new variants. Like everyone telling that‚Äôs news you‚Äôre downvoting.

Wait spike Ca April. 4th wave lets go choo choo! ~double thrombocytopenia cases az compared pfizer last checked (uk data) seems least bit unusual considering az usually given younger people  get vaccine resistance using vaccines. like initial variant sort lotto win. It'll something like vaccines first started government said 20 MM end December. Well, hit mark mid January pace increasing since.

Canucks don‚Äôt want us.

Conceding power mandate things like without legislation dangerous abused line enough people decide ok ""this time"" Europe‚Äôs handling rivals trump administrations handling Covid Yes global fight sooner US stops hoarding vaccines using better. Obviously I‚Äôm talking doses ready ship inject American‚Äôs arms, would hugely unpopular politically. stuff sitting storage, unapproved, getting closer expiration. What's going Indiana? feel like we've slipping terms vaccination rate, ahead US average per capita we're quickly falling behind (according Bloomberg's tracker).

Yet everytime look appointments nearby there's plenty available (I'm eligible can't say sure site accurate).

Is Indiana slow expand vaccination access? put /s one. SII make 2.5 billion AZ doses year. 10m would less 2 days worth production. factory India HUGE.  Agree that. think trying reinforce lockdown measures response panic though would certainly induce panic. missing something? thought vaccines free No. partner priority despite asthma, chronic strep throat, genetic blood lipid issues.

Exactly. said, point. KNOW representative Great thanks! 8 months late? probably variants long long time. Thanks! us one world leaders vaccination. said went week. Obviously it‚Äôs since crazy spikes post-holidays. Reading comprehension key it?

India currently producing 70 million doses month (ramping time), 10 million doses UK split 6 months. factor February January 100 million doses given out.

You're looking 1-2% total Indian production. Well, it‚Äôs educated, liberal, upper middle class would say. yes disconnect. question is...I wonder it‚Äôs know sign up/we eligible/and sites nearby.

Or it‚Äôs eager get vaccines large section (hence southern states) Thanks! totally agree. still ways normal OP never deleted comments you‚Äôd see referring mandated lockdowns like last Spring, restrictions. 

Maybe I‚Äôm biased see personally I‚Äôm OH indoor dining gyms open since June. Really thing left mask mandate full capacity large events. always bad reporting doses reported doses moment delivery minus doses used. doses truck central storage vaccination centres counted number doses. sMaLL bUsINeSsEs like Pfizer right? friend got J&amp;J shot Sunday. Said hit ‚Äúlike Mack truck‚Äù.  almost back feeling normal today. 

I first dose Phizer vaccine could feel 24 hours. saying funny knew mid-June outdoor transmission virtually impossible. encouraging people things outdoors. Instead, shamed people went beach park without mask. 

Then suddenly, barely able anything outdoors beautiful months, gets cold people starting go stir-crazy, go indoor parties friends/families, that‚Äôs virus spreads. coworker completely normal person. obese, 75 years old, pre existing conditions.

He got covid. hospital month half ventilators. came back, lost ton weight, lungs shit, heart literally skips beat.

While story average also abnormal.

It's ""sniffles""  Yes, media certainly overhypes things web clicks. I'm sure flu, possibly normalized people buy it. Also, overhype flu year year, people would eventually catch on.

I agree COVID deadly/contagious flu. Fortunately vaccines far effective (thus far) well. We'll see numbers look like compare vaccinated population COVID versus vaccinated population flu. factory part BT/Pfizers global supply chain , UK also get doses there. also live Central CA, exactly hospitalizations increasing? I'm stanislaus county, one worst hit counties state, hospital numbers dropped 300 100 last 6 weeks. Cases plummeting husband situation. spoke OBGYN vaccine work medical school asked assistant dean medicine head virologist taking it. cleared take vaccine soon possible much encouragement, January.

I got pfizer vaccine, second dose muscle aches cold maybe 3 hours felt completely fine.

According them, pregnant women higher chance ending ICU contract COVID. Plus asthma, double chances hospitalized get sick. 

Talk Dr get opinion  Vaccines allocated based adult population they're approved minors yet, Texas younger average state. compare states based doses administered per population states tend closer might expect based media narratives, could factor. everything I‚Äôve read heard Drosten, he‚Äôs excellent virologist doesn‚Äôt political agenda. 100F fever 12 hrs over. people don‚Äôt side effects per clinical trial data Good thing vaccinated 45-60 days! BS420.69 variant. super scurry. referring communist fever dream posters research government research. Yea general public Europe aren't, politicians supposed already, planned 3/22 allocations copy 3/15 allocations. Pretty frustrating  surge referring chico? I'm assuming bubble/social circle made fairly educated individuals. article says US importing vaccines EU. small batch december thats it. making even obscene amounts money

How money? earning return investment?

I know you, invest company, like get money back. work, like get paid labor.

I'm weird, know. done ages ago US friend trying sign parents vaccines they're convinced they're ineligible even though one hypertension obese. We're trying get doctor write letter can't use email. parents convinced they're lying eligibility super frustrating telling book quickly - text friend info, texts mom, feels bad booking. super inefficient frustrating. thoughts exactly. created whole mess shifting blame OR...or...we could wait 3 months vaccine coverage greater 60% could go back normal then. could ideal time too! Thousands people even need die. could cool! Read last week something like 1,600 +/- deaths linked Covid vaccines. surface seems like huge number, consider 100MM plus doses given, basically becomes statistical anomaly.  

We deaths year flu vaccines well - don‚Äôt report obsess deaths. 

First Phizer dose done... UK still receiving AstraZeneca vaccine doses produced EU?

No. AZ comes UK factories, plus took delivery India well.

But get Pfizer EU factory Belgium. disconnect people know representative entire population Texas believe benefits outweigh risks, that's said far website. visited Q&amp;A link posted. question Natalia was: (1) better continue vaccinations (2) related specific batch

Emer Cooke answered replying: *""Thank much yes, think clearly said outlined benefit/risk vaccine remains positive. conclusion published last week. conclusion published yesterday. respect link specific batches ...""* 

I want super pedantic - specifically state advising halting roll-out. remain confident risk low. light investigation. Maybe we're reading differently. Funny everyone keeps using arguments like most. 

Brits: free market ordered earlier.

Americans: ours, produced soil.

EU... ‚ÄúThreatens‚Äù?! already! Wouldn‚Äôt one million hospitalized? Majority cases don‚Äôt need hospital care won‚Äôt see post-viral effects. Yeah, I‚Äôm hoping get act together decent enough vaccination rates July/August open things up. government screwed also person needs show responsibility well. Fuck president says wear fucking masks carnival night parties FFS. nation becomes world threat world needs join together isolate since give fuck. Think horrible nation stop spread, must never ending nightmare. Well morale inspiring hear ""obey say enough"" know. 2-3% confirmed covid cases still absolute shitton people.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* America lockdowns whole time. city, Boston, looks like ghostown still. America also hording vaccines, advantage Germany have. 1. point article Pfizer going wait pandemic raise prices.
2. reason US vaccinating 3 million people day Canadians twiddling dicks US large private pharmaceuticals makers infrastructure experience produce millions vaccines day. companies exist operate profit. company charging wants product allowed? wanted arrange something government purchases patent handles production/distribution going forward, I'd that, Pfizer absolutely deserves financially rewarded amazing work they've done creating vaccine. I'm quite grateful vaccine companies. They're going give life back year loneliness boredom. point people US UK stop blaming ""EU bad contracts"" start also seeing thousands lives lost AZ deliveries many people, like myself, really fucking annoyed even depressed locked houses months see signs improvements AZ major role this?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope god EU sue hell shitty company 50/12 = 4.17

In given month expect 4 cases distribution totally even. Obviously not. 

They've using vaccine two months. expect 8 cases (excepting distribution).

The vaccine selectively distributed people likely spontaneous thrombosis reasons: elderly, etc.

7 cases came up.

To suggest cases likely caused vaccine disingenuous posturing. *barely* baseline.

Even every death caused vaccine, (7/1.6 million) 0.043%, 100 times lower rate death actual Covid.

This stupidest timeline. 1. Cases rise states still net decline across entire country.

2. Mask use depend state you‚Äôre actions individual companies. Even state mask use isn‚Äôt required, may still wear mask in, say, Home Depot it‚Äôs store policy. don‚Äôt like this, understand, it‚Äôs minor inconvenience everything else ‚Äúback normal‚Äù.

3. Large gatherings absolutely back. Already states opening sports stadiums spectators. Expect see number people gather together increase vaccinations continue weather gets warmer. basically top states vaccinations high native populations. Alaska, oklahoma, new mexico. Pretty cool. German company turn Pfizer scale manufacturing rest EU wouldn‚Äôt invest BNT fear seen kickback German interests. 

The whole EU made rain BNT early whole world would dealing uncertainty EU causing cheap shitty manufacturing. Anecdotally Texas...which fairly liberal eligibility, everyone know vaccinated. still lagging near bottom country. appears disconnect somewhere They're already making profit charging premium. price gouging allowed? mean rate much Europe anyway, past year bars restaurants open like 2 months tops non take away things country. Even would less restrictions summer expect normal vacation feeling pre covid. ask? know one exact date. Fauci seems think current vaccination rates summer getting close normal fall could pre pandemic normal.

However relies people continuing respect cdc guidelines. It‚Äôs luck, it‚Äôs understanding lot restrictions real scientific evidence making positive impact whatsoever. live upstate agree 100% you. Life NY slowly inching closer normal, truly believe nothing changed result pandemic, you‚Äôre idiot. I‚Äôm sure point is. media boogeyman overhypes everything web clicks, not? don‚Äôt flu? There‚Äôs large difference 500,000 deaths 40,000 deaths. It‚Äôs likely get back normal Covid still kill 1000s+ people year get used people die lot diseases year point balance risk vs sort lockdown. That‚Äôs exactly US attempting now. Get people vaccinated. See number deaths hospitalizations decline get back normal. Maybe Covid end like flu. Maybe not. big issue it‚Äôs appears contagious flu. I'm it. Unless research fully subsidized, companies make money, there's incentive make drug first place. think French? think France Europe?

That graph also contradicts stuff saw, think projection. *EU seize factory...* 

Marxist change underwear right 

But good thing need play rules expedite vaccination campaign Go kidcovestudy.com information. Yes, child autistic? /s Yeah, I'm sure get away it. But, like said, I've come far. I'd rather wait five days bend rules. Also, uncomfortable conversation have, certain point, probably pretty soon, people getting hospitalized mostly gonna vulnerable people *chose* get vaccinated, really taking measures protect people, since just, know, get vaccinated. tragic AGREE!!! I'm Serbia, EU member state, negotiations, agreements EU getting vaccines them. Stop freaking exports US UK! kind spineless organizatiom allows milked like that?!?! supplying Pfizer (UK) JnJ (US). US refused share AZ, able use least month need anyway. Jolly good! promise life extrovert better mine bunker nothing year three extremely high risk people living me. would kill feel comfortable going things regardless wear mask not.

And problem saying cases low need keep measures place second loosen cases go skyrocket control. obvious. Weather variants much bigger impact people lost minds function reckless media campaign fundamentally alter way think, act be. less year created product absurdly massive value consumers. Imo, deserve get rewarded financially. dont alternative already exist. hybrid system socialism elements free market already proven work best, now.

Leave Big Pharma corps unregulated able increase prices will, failed system. still spread others you‚Äôre symptomatic. Later year start traveling work again. can‚Äôt travel you‚Äôre sick, get stuck hotel room expose people home stuck isolation. usual suspect EuroGammons eating though, seems. generation largely vaccinated. reason deaths hospitalizations fallen like rock COVID largely eradicated nursing homes congregant settings. 

Unless mutations start killing kids 20 year olds, think see hospitalizations deaths like waves 1-3. They‚Äôre seizing AZ vaccines euro political leaders like Macron say vaccine doesn‚Äôt even work. sure EU knows it‚Äôs rn. really know dick works. know government grants are? fund scientific research universities institutions.

Also every fortune 500 company gets money specifically r&amp;d government. Specially pharma industry, specially vaccine. Quit talking ass pretending knowledgeable. /r/coronavirus? get non obvious symptoms someone without tell feel? Europe..... Probably means they're fatter Articles briefly read said high heat best would imagine washing drying hot setting would best option counties already have. almost sure people got COVID north america first officially reported cases here. I'm also sure vast majority people convinced got COVID started taking March get COVID. Otherwise would seen explosive spread way sooner did. lab professional Canada definitely testing anyone suspicious symptoms February low/no positives March.

As aside, years ago thought cold would go away. sore throat bit sniffles, eventually developed cough. Never fever, convinced flu something bacterial. Convinced something viral didnt bother going urgent care clinic knowing they'd say something viral send home. took cold two weeks finally went see Doctor, believe smoker checked stethoscope. Turns strep, still idea never fever much sore throat. Moral story infections weird one thing presents completely atypically. Could COVID, could something completely random doc think test for.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nah I'm lefty hell shit needs end. Sounds like something good shouldn‚Äôt large gathering? Cases hospitalizations cratering getting vaccinated great way embrace freedom without anxiety.

That's like telling depressed person ""just suck happy.""

As former health anxiety sufferer, years therapy instead taught get sick die, day. could die quickly slowly, something impact health negatively _will_ die it.

All vaccine (for illness, covid) remove one tiny thing massive list possible things eventually kill me.

Want beat anxiety? Worry change forget everything else. Also understand worrying almost never changes situation. feel point needs emphasising more. needs clear communication incidence rates blood clots vaccination, general population actually covid. important realise everything risk, choosing risk COVID varient problem there? another outbreak there? Varients? Novavax coming month - latest data higher efficacy Mrna ones. tested UK South Africa variants already (in humans, test tubes). Maybe timing work look option. Good luck!  happening there? yes mean risky bringing cloths house office go outside. usually wash cloths sometimes hang sunlight. curios sunlight clean cloths virus can't find research yet this. Figure misinformation side effects relevant her.... trying babies? need 5g? live life worth microchipping? Etc unexpected side effect worried about, talk one specifically US trial wrapping stuck right? Makes sense graph use US trial info since it‚Äôs pretty clearly communicating US market. good hear rational thing. sigh.....

would rather get covid? usually drink beer two donating highly effective :) Also even did, soap would kill washing machine. humans. necessarily true. There's large amounts vaccine shelves going unused Europe currently. Somewhere region 3/5s delivered AZ vaccine Germany France used ready distributed. Vaccines really that. nothing happened within first weeks getting, nothing going road. said, tell covid much higher chance negative effects road, choose one (and unless staying basement forever, basically - goes whole life without getting flu, even contagious) might well choose one lower chance cause problems later. Agree, hospitalizations golden metric vs cases point. herd immunity Papua New Guinea Papua New Guinea. One Australia's closest neighbours. sure NJ Hackensack Meridian Health appointments Meadowlands opening midnight fairly consistently. cvs appointments well midnight website lock sometimes, try best chance select state openings like Alabama next page enter local zip code. doses stored sub-zero temperature? I‚Äôve always curious Well unless lick hands touching work clothes it‚Äôs going get body  Papua New Guinea think factored hospitalizations instead using cases metric though. Pfizer available used extensively Europe though Really? I've donated 4 times past year, they've never called phone (they definitely number). email time time nothing I'd call excessive, emails easy filter. honestly common sense idk said hot topic. amount vaccines used near max amount deliver open wider audience. healthy people yet? Novavax awesome - wish included approved next month so.   I'm trial follow data closely weekend released efficacy highest far. somewhere eligible bit longer, keep eye Novavax. wrong Illinois fucking horrible. fair wouldn‚Äôt get vaccine Walmart, period. even flu shot. 18-year-old, say rather large amount peers want attend in-person classes. People forgetting education America pretty fucking bad, begin with.  mobility almost pre covid. yeah, idiots. yes according many news i.e Moderns Genesis Ohio 50. Scheduled Sunday. Let‚Äôs goooo! They‚Äôre vaccinated. would feel totally comfortable visiting precautions. America: ""Gotta pump numbers up. rookie numbers"" Heh - unlikely case AZ gets banned countries EU, guess much easier everybody else get hands AZ future.

But think AZ ""pass"" examination. Even 'other' profit, I'm assuming not, that's $3.60-$4.80. Meanwhile head Pfizer spoke investors ability hike price vaccine seems boosters needed.

I'm assuming 'other' covers cost stuff ""regulatory submissions distribution, [which] related manufacturing."" (from article Ft) . There's vaccine production manufacturing. 65% much substantial honestly, 1k deaths per million. There's one Lexington. Awesome sympathy exhibited here.

Good early days bowed loony right wing legislature forced removal Amy Acton. 

I imagine race attempt get much done legislature strips emergency powers. much Ginaforte fan all, great thing able do! They're ""unwanted"". They're checking going on. expectation OK doses used OK.

If AZ approved, yeah guess could sell them. IDK laws require us destroy them, would dumb. Hopefully come soon Wow glad coming nicely absolutely horrible December/January sure, even family friends retired doctors received vaccine. concern vaccine sort effect years road. may secret political slant this, certainly come conversation. thank much! Hey, I'm one people December 23rd 2019, acute respiratory infection leading pneumonia. doctor know was, know ""not known-coronavirus influenza."" saying covid, dealing long term effects. virus doesn‚Äôt spread clothing. really don‚Äôt need worry getting clothes. felt super shitty second pfizer shot. small price pay, able ease back normal soon! Omg. know! look Lima is. must received like zillion doses nobody bothered drive there. 71 vaccinated residents facility, one hospital, four 13 unvaccinated residents hospitalized. words, four five patients hospitalized unvaccinated one vaccinated, per Stack. 

I'd curious know time interval vaccination infection 1 hospitalization. There's reason able get no-waste dose easily live Ohio. Someone know rural town grew asked FB post anyone planned getting vaccine, like two replied yes, lotttttt no's. I'm surprised see resistance Spain. economy absolute toilet even average since dependent tourism. People say 'fuck it' doesnt stop everything still closed. 1000s people dying 3 people dying blood clot

Take pick, moron politicians. enjoy staying lockdown Summer. haven‚Äôt heard that.

The reason ask I've back work traveling across USA since June. I've never questioned teachers risk professions outside medicine kids snotty germ factories. 

Please share thoughts me. like close friend mine go restaurant, get covid, end spouse holding hand hospital panicked talk doctors possibly ventilating. die though! England alone, alcohol costs NHS estimated ¬£3.5 billion every year, accounts around 7 per cent hospital admissions.  Things getting pretty bad Michigan. Yeah. fantasy actually happened actually worked. That's fantasy. That's reality. care CCP all, mind you. I'm sure shit sticking them. I'm countering weak attempts back away claim lockdowns effective. course are. reality communicable diseases stopped ensuring people stay away other. want run around mingle? OK, understand prolonging pandemic, covids best friend. America. Say thanks Von der Leyen 36 male here, Ohio wife got appointment setup 4/3. giving us Johnson Johnson vaccine.

We pre-existing conditions anything, exciting. it? exporting UK? Make mind.

Also, cares UK. problem exports outside EU general. Doesnt matter specific country going to. live LA media trying tactic huge spike was, time (Will Farrell Zoolander voice) ""So hot right now"" . media desperate compete clicks right lockdowns whole time.

Parts America, sure. There's lots parts country really lockdowns since last spring they're seeing city, Boston, looks like ghostown still.

I doubt that. I'll bet true downtown (and Boston kind weird geographically rather small), neighborhoods? Doubt it. certainly true places like Brooklyn, even Manhattan looks like relative ghost town. saying they're anti-vax misinformation probably gotten them. clearly show they're eligible want acknowledge it, something else going there. True. basically EU threatening solve contract dispute vendor threatening ally. Classy. deal virus vaccinating vulnerable population subgroups virus less likely mutate. cases declined EVERYWHERE, places locked time period. I'm poor that's need $300 Air China tickets. right thing do

I agree. Even cases would caused vaccine, people die investigate

I agree that. Even worse, imagine believing it. Yet steadfastly refuse acknowledge second point regarding Salaries. Scientists private firms receive MUCH better renumeration... hence win-win. make difference since EU legal entitlement doses Pfizer would confiscating make shortfall AstraZeneca Well didn't, otherwise almost certainly would least 6 months faster. incentives aligned, likely would seen Pfizer, Moderna, pharmaceuticals ramping production March. also would done larger trials considered smaller dosing schemes. 

But again, incentives aligned make decisions cost effective even though societal benefits would enormous. Trying penny pinch area terrible policy idea, losses risk orders magnitude larger possible savings. really don‚Äôt need lecture take offered. understand importance getting vaccinated sooner rather later. wish could specific circumstances taken account get preference option. Given common side effects, I‚Äôm sure people would rather get J&amp;J spending days sick dog mRNA. would personally rather mRNA. wouldn‚Äôt affect rates it‚Äôs coordinated well. 

And please understand better get pfizer moderna need travel, given CDC guidelines post vaccination restrictions. unfond vaccines? Hasnt little proof outdoor transmission COVID-19 possible? trajectory current surge 20-25 percent less early fall/late winter surge.

So vaccinations policy adjustment reduce spread, still climbing point measuring absolute peak, agree this?

We agree current big spike, approaching biggest spike they've had, even vaccines, also entered restrictions policy adjustments prevent going further.

Right?

Judging votes, look like majority sub agrees boss. Fear blocking doses, fear massive delays due logistics? could 100% right, seen concrete statements European J&amp;J doses bottled US confiscated. think actually care, incompetent actually make things happen. people still tolerating restrictions? people finally say ""enough""? fly HK Tokyo.  Neither big deal means finely get this. people wanting eat Denny‚Äôs happen dumbasses won‚Äôt wear mask. think overlooking fact Pfizer sunk billions upon billions dollars development production vaccine (and even take funding US Operation Warp Speed). Obviously getting many people vaccinated possible important thing, pricing vaccine low moment, think harsh say company cannot begin reap financial benefits production innovation vaccine scarcity begins go down. fact companies like Pfizer Biontech rewarded innovation entire reason incredible mRNA technology development going save millions lives across world. vaccine supply going much larger come summer well, Pfizer raise prices point still competitive vaccines likely attractive governments due lower cost storage transportation.

It's nice say market lifesaving drugs, hard truth entire reason tech infrastructure make drugs market them. Nah. I'm telling idea ""real lockdown"" demented fantasy good thing never allowed inflict rest society. keep stewing Reddit, surely trick. actually perfect illustration point, thanks. enough right, take account people respond whatever saying. People want locked deal disruption normality year. want compared children make likely agree you. heard that. ones i'd seen show little 14, lot 28...do recall studys links?

edit: see link posted later, show 92% 14, shows barely margin error 14 ridiculously amazing 2nd dose could lives back people actually cooperated restrictions. lives back 60% vaccinated. I'm sure US would help UK case. first US saves UK blockaded fanatical German. Hold on, telling medical advances took longer occur technology way primitive?

What. A. Shocker. arent even using AZ vaccine italy fully opened up, surely day massive ""spike"" kill 99% population, right??! /s !RemindMe 3 months


""Even slight decrease efficacy enough cause concern boosters worked right now, scientists anticipate us needing them. needing right now, preparing mutations see future."" Yeah arent doctors. arent use reading stuff everyday. use least inflammatory title possible. One spells out. age media distrust many sides titles part problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Why not

CDC looking new California Variant . Variants happen may may consequence. Exactly, saw easiest opportunity win Republican. Divide 2 boss. 2 doses per person. literally vaccinating people. end sight. 

Sure, I‚Äôll believe see it. ‚ÄúA weeks‚Äù *always* sort explanation. It‚Äôs flatten curve. It‚Äôs help hospitals. It‚Äôs weather turning cold again. It‚Äôs get data variant. It‚Äôs PPE available. 

Sooner later people realize there‚Äôs always ‚Äújust‚Äù. I‚Äôll honest, I‚Äôm convinced everyone wants vaccine one, people gonna say OK go live life. It‚Äôs gonna ‚Äúwe need wait tad longer see there‚Äôs vaccine uptake. need wait see long immunity lasts. need see new variants evade immunity‚Äù. hope blocks put action vaccine producers changing allocation key *slightly* favor EU countries given urgent need stop spread. lead states dropping mask mandates loosening restrictions, least residents pushing happen. headline destroyed brain. say it‚Äôs safe hard that. Pretty big drop case numbers LA county past days! Great see possible due less people tested? Volunteer fire departments smaller population areas local government can‚Äôt pay tax base. equipment trucks typically still paid tax dollars. also far fewer fires put per year. 

It nothing worth firefighter city. government absolutely provides well this. OP likely counting useless redundant questions state site. 

like counting three questions ""do cancer? chemo? taking cancer drugs?"" etc rather one thought. many state websites really weird right try figure stage in. could call ""one question"" said ""do meet following conditions....."" could count 18 questions make one yes/no question know China let transfer airports... Many places longer freedom assembly, freedom protest peacefully, freedom worship, even freedom leave house. People dying increased suicides, increased overdoses, undiagnosed cancer, lack exercise, etc. government used fear overrule human rights. everyone going it. fact is, get J&amp;J vaccine, going much careful lot longer covid completely gone. Well, thinking open exchange ideas perspective. I'm getting feeling upset me. friends? ban driving, alcohol tobacco it. Unfortunately movie comes 2 weeks, doubt theaters long enough even got first shot today. even close amount vaccinations administered. Italy around 12 per 100 people vaccines administered US 33. Taiwan China, probably not. going change people vaccinated. know frustrating accept, bullet ends this.

And guess what? bullet, speeding along great speak. everywhere US, May adult going eligible. Yes, vaccines work spooky variants, even ""not *as* effective"" still bring virus knees comes death/transmission. 

The US going great summer unless massive new mutation true vaccine escape (no, headline says variant ""of concern"" verification that) production current vaccines brought halt reason. vaccines? people died due highly contagious, air-born virus know infectious people pre-symptomatic.

Yea, show much better mortality rates states locked hardest vs didn't.

Or mesh doom gloom agenda that's losing grip lately? Hence need crank fear porn tEh VaRiAnTs? Great news 100 million doses administered. That‚Äôs 1/3 entire US population. Yikes. sarcasm detector broken. apologies. Didnt California open recently? reduce restrictions? tennessee asking 30 questions

why would possibly time open anyone 16 though people elderly/sick trouble finding appointment time? time open young healthy open appointments can't filled ""needy"" UK nothing that, AZ private company. Plus EU countries approve AZ elderly. havent seen anything suggesting far worse. I've heard less effective, still provides plenty 2/3rds reduction still super effective. must amazing see end sight. wish UK well hope first pint tastes amazing think transmittable bears certain sexual preference. absolutely blame EU 13 27 member states suspended use. ESPECIALLY powerful member states (not talking little mickey mouse ex soviet satellites). answer ""no"". actually can't name single country better nations real lockdowns. Thank you. Quick, change topic ""freedom"" admit clueless reality! Maybe someone buy horseshit selling. 84,000 doses administered California's 4th quartile last day. rate, hit 4 million goal easier tier metrics 19 days. 

Not bad. Bit difference wearing masks staying home weeks. Actually national governments EU usually capable deal crisis. EU however never dealt crisis magnitude. 

Search ‚Äúdelta project‚Äù see Netherlands protected flooding. think intentional.

There's reason post 73 upvotes 5-10 Like polio vaccine took decades develop? margin, mission. Lockdowns work early. Unfortunately long really lockdown allowed go work everyday. remember, things didn‚Äôt exist capitalism. Innovation hadn‚Äôt even invented yet. It‚Äôs surely ‚Äúism‚Äù responsible advancement, labor. Lies!! country Yugoslavia!!! think 'blame UK' approach falls consider numbers. AZ manufacturing UK designed produce vaccines scale would make much difference EU. may equating UK's total orders EU Q1 orders. single shot lesser protection smaller amount time comparison 2 shot. partial protection governments like UK much longer span doses, give preliminary protection longer time still end full efficacy.   exactly think taxes for? think funds military? privatize military too, ""if want soldiers military equipment, need capital that. Shit appear thin air"".

Public universal healthcare systems operate fine in: Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Isle Man, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom.

If America goddamn great, I'm sure too. problem government paying it, particularly instance. long company fairly compensated. 

Calling healthcare human right interesting, extent agree. first world country certain things really guaranteed everyone, end day things higher demand supply allow. think selling services highest bidder makes sense, encourages availability. that, disappointment seeing EU actually like. pro EU, literally heartbroken brexit vote came through. beginning pandemic hoping much government would go EU vaccine procurement, thought much capable reliable UK government. really proved completely unrealistic view them, they're like governments even red tape. insistence rejoin EU first opportunity sort faded, passion EU project sort faded 'meh' feeling it. Lockdown term bit problematic sounds harsh reality lockdowns vary country country what's locked varies too. lockdowns party reductions others lock people homes.

Lockdowns, harsh mild, absolutely work. They're method reduce amount contacts people other. reduction contacts reduces spread helps.

Unfortunately spread efficient densely packed cities really hard push spread coefficient enough maintaining basic services everything cannot stop modern world.

That means lockdowns must really quite harsh.

You course fuck things entirely stopping abide. Try yo get hospital broken leg happens. joke. I'm side here. right one taken seriously ever said would two weeks. using fact that, technically, one person *did* say would two weeks rhetorical device make point side debate so-called lockdowns better track record. many doses AstraZeneca EU exporting UK anyway?

None anymore. news bemuses me. Either planning black Pfizer exports empty sabre rattling detract failures. PS: go running authoritarian regime zero transparency horrendous human rights record ""success"" story, maybe time pack in. beat goes can‚Äôt anymore. I‚Äôm serious lol i‚Äôm kinda slow pretty heavy news. Ayyyyeee Nah he's cool time. tough year. pretty hard talk anything 5 minutes without COVID mentioned, we've always family strong opinions. Everything forgotten come fall. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine wanting go eat important right now!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow see protesting civil rights much important going beach?‚Äù next Novavax? agree, except clear timeline communicated here. friends, I'm autistic/non-human.
 
I mean could sanitize spot put bandaid. Like I'll wear gloves part can't I?

Like want get vaccine help herd immunity. want right thing. J&amp;J shot fucked fever 3 days swollen red arm near injection site still knot arm 8 days later. That's 4421 deaths scaled size United States. imagine they‚Äôve reached stage criteria probably wouldn‚Äôt lot hoop jumping verification. Might depend location, though. Mine Monday, anything special, much better last one... booked appointment Turn site. Maybe Canada mass produce barter much needed vaccines. parents go get vaccines, third degree exposure, require quarantine long symptom free, unless China something. follow standard precautions proceed normally (in case, go get vaccines). Even infected, getting vaccine dangerous, know people vaccine trials infected time vaccination despite screening protocols fine. vaccination centers masking distancing policies protect everyone case people unknowingly infected. theory, yes. offer drive them? know grandparents can't drive far.  States get vaccines proportion population wife got vaccine January never got asked proof. brother got his, never asked proof.

I'm guessing look heavy one's going question it. Cases still falling though post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Maybe they'll add more? two utah? 3 texas, 2 sc... well distributed all. How‚Äôs boots taste certain countries spreading second dosages help many people get first dose possible? US/UK dual national, that‚Äôs mind too. don‚Äôt answer you. planning trip London May. Looks like I‚Äôll quarantine 10 days get two tests...even though I‚Äôll jabs then. Assume take governments adjust rules vaccinated / not. 

But personal opinion vaccine passport great use world. understand inherent problems becoming reality. mom nursing home unit highest-care residents 100% offered &amp; took vaccine. 1/2 staff did. 

I haven‚Äôt heard single person (personally) advised getting it. mom extensive stroke history, got shot &amp; hardly noticed it. MIL stage 4 cancer &amp; also strongly advised get &amp; also nothing sore arm one day. According we're million population. also population ""boom"" last year people moving Montana thinking could escape virus.

12,000 still many imo. don‚Äôt push ridiculously optimistic bullshit sub you‚Äôre downvotes oblivion.

This sub said US would averaging 4 million vaccine doses administered day now. Nowhere near ""When polio vaccine¬†was declared safe effective, news met with¬†jubilant celebration. Church bells rang across nation, factories blew¬†their whistles. ‚ÄúPolio routed!‚Äù newspaper headlines exclaimed. ‚ÄúAn historic victory,‚Äù ‚Äúmonumental,‚Äù ‚Äúsensational,‚Äù newscasters¬†declared. People erupted joy across United States. danced streets;¬†others wept. Kids sent home school celebrate.

One might expected initial approval coronavirus vaccines spark similar jubilation‚Äîespecially brutal pandemic year. didn‚Äôt happen. Instead, steady drumbeat good news vaccines met chorus relentless pessimism.""

- Hard top one! really encompasses lot things miss.

This one's gone yet soon: Widespread mandatory masks.  refusing. I‚Äôm eager take it‚Äôs turn.

I refuse cut line ahead higher-risk people who‚Äôre eagerly lining up, lying I‚Äôm current phase. I‚Äôm surprised controversial. Yup! Exactly like this. Takes lot move mountains. Everything sucked, tiny silver linings hopefully project least one good thing future. think we‚Äôre quickly approaching point it‚Äôs getting shots arms distributing vaccines. hearing 7mill distributed vs 2 mil administered means things going flip real quick. problem.

RemindMe! 4 months People thinking going year without socialization, celebrations, things look forward ""nbd"" *healthy.* **actively shaming others** express miss things, telling people selfish wanting lives arent work, sleep, video games, Netflix Statistically, covid huge concern young healthy. think math fine. I'd rather accept risk never really live like human again. Oh yeah, vaccine protects new strains right? first one rn That's cool.

Why cannot schedule shot 70 year old dad? So? mean start open up, it‚Äôs going permanent. we‚Äôre open right now. genuinely think Canada Mexico going first countries benefit expected glut vaccines we're going States next month. Realistically, y'all start vaccinating gen pop end June latest decent healthcare system get jabs 30,000,000 arms pretty quickly imagine. it‚Äôs asinine risk assessment anti-science.  part today! Pfizer, side effects far. Sounds like really hate brother, sorry feel way sucks Actually game changer. talking 12 weeks, time probably US lift ban vaccines export. meantime EU half vaccinated anyway. I'm Cleveland, almost teared saw news today. We're home stretch, guys. think dead people still human rights? need china stop virus dumb? Learn experience.
Why westerners never humble wtf human right? 100000s deaths count human rights? Idiots  makes think there's issue Astra Zeneca plant. supposed ramp delivery end March, blue said couldn't, this. Late May  I'm kinda surprised it. Good him! Wisconsin Saturday. warm enough could wear shorts. went mall curbside pickup take pizza back home Michigan. mall parking lot 95% capacity. people walking mall masks on, second stepped outside, many popped off. Restaurants everything city Appleton, slammed customers. Olive Garden passed full line door. happy see everybody wearing masks stores visited, felt like nobody gave shit social distancing. Median age 22.4 according Google. good thing Covid begins working way younger populations. I'm waiting list. good chunk ""fellow"" Montanans antivaxxers, bizarre way thanking them, means potentially get sooner. Ok dumb? would totally take vaccine. Nobody going think ""Oh cause state unable open up?"" sick considering going hospital. others. nobody cares. want test get test. Nobody going wait potentially develop serious symptoms might cause people wear mask bit longer. Thought people might find interesting. 100% experience. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs spreading school, it‚Äôs admin Honestly, grandmother dying child basically zero adverse impact life. would nice she'd lived longer, hardly shocking development octogenarians pass away even little humans pretty mentally well equipped handle it.

Whether cost calculus makes sense not, damage isolating children almost certainly worse children losing grandparent. like 22%, 111 million doses includes second doses well. Take moment realize pandemic thing. every day thing even pandemic. tragic system failing children. here. Got COVID symptoms 3/20/2020 recently got antibody test done antibodies. Hopefully continue sub saying would near 4 million day 3 year old seems happy wear dinosaur Paw Patrol masks knows he‚Äôs keeping others safe. beginning, he‚Äôs worn zero emotional physical issues. that‚Äôs idea abuse, really touch reality. CDC exploring whether transform entire world one giant classroom, apparently Covid doesn‚Äôt exist there... see even board pretty frequently: ""I've GOOD past year social distancing, IIIII ANGRY IIIIIIIIII (a healthy 32 year old comorbidities) can't get appointment ASSHOLES around ignored rules YEAR getting shot! FAIR!!!

My brother also posted something like social media week two ago.  r/notheonion overheard another hissed to,""Suck elope!!"" least sanitize spot put bandaid on. Maybe could get friend drive drive thru clinic appropriately medicated worry walking around driving yourself. certainly cause issues equal rights treatment law... I'm shocked /u/Evan_Th seems think black people hesitant get vaccine, back line, government focus eager get instead. I'm Novavax Phase 3 trial can't wait get EUA! Seems like great vaccine and, nurses trial site said, appears low side effects too. Feels like nobody US talking it.

The UK trial data really good, mostly matter FDA willing grant authorization based UK data it'll want wait US trial hits benchmark (a certain number positive cases). Mexico, along Argentina, due bottle Anglo-Swedish vaccine South American market, Argentina manufactures vaccine part deal AstraZeneca.

But recent vaccine shortages faults production process seen Mexico turn towards China Russia supplies recent weeks. Reuters reported, Mexican officials say sources reliable asking western countries. *For reference, AFAIK, single healthy person 50 died Covid-19 Norway. potential true disaster*

God wish Norway would adopt me. That‚Äôs mental health works. Yeah, it‚Äôll better environment think people driven isolation fear virus gonna bounce back everything said done? No, certainly not. It‚Äôs easy dig hole mind it‚Äôs hard climb out. speak experience covid depression hospitalized myself. Let's save old people fuck young process. Great society strong weakest oldest yeah, sort agree, dunno. answer question: nope, personally know 2 3 people passed away. couple friends sick people know who've issues covid previous diseases. 

the thing privileged background mosto family friends - remember Brazil socially segregated. I've working home exactly year live big city, within nice neighborhood good access healthcare delivery services. can't imagine like Brazilian less privileges, really, maybe relates US? anxiety look CDC say people long covid symptoms website. Holding higher efficacy vaccine long term reasonable someone able safely isolate waiting, particularly situation even mild case COVID would carry risk complications.

Lower-efficacy vaccines great broad use young, healthy people. high-efficacy vaccines, too, someone needs extra protection shouldn‚Äôt shamed waiting making right decision health care. witness conversation like this. Heard older woman explain younger couple nothing ever goes plan honeymoon flight got delayed hour couple decades prior. 

Yeah, no, quite cancel wedding plans, replan, whatever. feel bad folks. live Michigan, phase 1A still can‚Äôt get mine. I‚Äôm happy sucks left behind county recently added overweight (ie qualification covid vaccine. family member whose 50 overweight well. anybody know experience verification process works? Like, overweight need doctor's note something? get anywhere 24-42 days first dose know anxiety Finally got mine today. Hallelujah!!!! hitting like train though. fan that. use example though, I'm bunch medical wtf. 

The thing high risk people rare disease somehow much danger healthy 50yo Ohio bunch wtf. strict administration age left lot high risk people high dry months.

Ohio also managed prioritize type 2 diabetes asthma.

""No increased risk"" means worse flu actually bad asthmatics. Science asthma really dirty this. I‚Äôm lake county too. always surprise people fact Indiana‚Äôs 1st district (basically lake county) hasn‚Äôt sent republican congress 90 years, one longest streaks country. We're know everyone brain fog they're different symptoms- Danish, confirm. Restrictions loosened. Restaurants allowed 50% capacity example. Yes. That's good, damage done Macron etc that. know happen tested yet. Sorry condition. need inject specific spot arm muscle. pinch hold would make accurate control needle. would talk them, maybe choose different spot besides arm, prepared stickler rules :)
or rather
:P Maybe see buy shot blocker ask use it? Shot blockers plastic pieces distract sensation injection also prevents person giving shot touching directly. Mast Cell Dysfunction? Mass Cell Disorder? I‚Äôll join need make sure US compensated fairly risk took. would nice government took profit make selling vaccines paid ‚Äúfreedom dividend‚Äù citizens.  March Madness over. Count it. US definitely lot look variants. Prior Jan 21, no. working improve area. Covid passport Israel think first. think validity 6 months. understand happens expires. want passport work international destinations future. state. supposedly one best health systems here, 3x ICUs already made.  Moderna &amp; Pfizer/Biontech vaccines (aka tier 1 vaccines) still believed effective variants? many. anyone info vaccines interact specific blood types longest scale data? 2 weeks second pfizer shot. Feel like lucked things considered. 

I say Az J&amp;J vaccines bad (they're not) look past hand wavey kabuki public health officials engage try get people hold mRNA vaccines seems rather clear qualitative edge even huge advantage paint as. would say thing US. There‚Äôs big difference New Jersey Oregon right now. use keep refreshing good luck! 33% adults, Americans. none companies liable injuries thanks current legal standings. median age 68 years, kind geriatric study. geriatric medicine, walking speed surprisingly good indicator overall health. like measuring functional age instead biological age. believe study came last year reported 80 year old walking speed 65 year old, person's odds dying Covid likely closer 65 year olds 80 year old. walking speed thing probably applicable young people. article says, walking speed indication general cardiovascular health. would presumably connection. lucky take it. wait become safer. I‚Äôm severely allergic eggs, milk, dyes, medicine, bees.. grrr barely survived covid. hope everyone takes around Thanks downvote, kind internet stranger. partly right true depending adenovirus comes from. e.g. issue AZ amazing many redditers fall anti-lockdown campaign going right now. Dang, I‚Äôm sorry. could get buddy join west Michigan north Michigan vaccine hunters group, usually excellent resources get vaccines local area. used get vaccines eligible family members multiple different states. shouldn‚Äôt way, waiting someone contact could take long time. hope you‚Äôre able get one soon. Italy locked bud 21.4% Americans vaccinated today. That's saying. locked down, incidents. Maybe arranged society made parents despise spending time children, issue. Sure could overlap CFS/ME diagnosis exclusion time, majority profiled autoantibody repertoire. purely physical causes, HPA axis misalignment really seems like driver majority CFS pts. Doubt one cause going ever break CFS/ME dx. 90% range 2 months, seems take bit longer fully effective, really 2 weeks later Moderna. also can't really compare efficacy rates clinical trials since different. looking great they're pretty similar 2 months. many vaccines work.
 
Lots medical facilities send reminders vaccines due. could get severe side effects, it‚Äôs like ice cream better. Combination slow vaccine rollout plus locking early prolonged spread. really believer ‚Äúvariants.‚Äù Hey, know transmission? Pfizer vaccine stops transmission, Coronavac's doesn't. would like know there's evidence vaccines, since took Johnson Johnson's. mean, chronic anxiety isn't.

There's external reasons causing widespread public anxiety though. get better COVID slows down. Completing clinical trials, least stated early on. personally think delayed AZ trials give leg profits... we‚Äôll probably wait Netflix documentary see what‚Äôs really going anything. depends adenovirus comes from. AZ JJ issue, one Chinese ones comes common cold issue immuno compromised. Call every Walgreens area surrounding you. Get ahold pharmacy. Asked put Covid-19 vaccination overflow list. Got parents vaccinated ( &lt; 55 yo) method saying weeks everywhere British variant 30 60% lethal ... Yes way... mean diagnosed Bartonella? Bartonella type bacteria causes various diseases. know name diagnosed with? wait vaccine like normal person people leverage good ole boy networks get ahead. Even Pfizer one difficult store news makes out. Sure, medium long term storage requires stupidly cold freezers, survive 30 days dry ice container, 5 days standard vaccine fridge (2-8c).
 
Sure, might difficult get really remote areas, anywhere regular shipping power fine. get think second challenge resultant formation germinal centers clonal selection going trim anti-self memory B cells rather upping anti-CoV2 somatic hypermutation/affinity maturation process? Unless idea less directed anti-spike antibodies anti-self, which, fair enough, could be. completely unreasonable people cytokine storm part disease course guess. good explanation people long-covid cases occur, vast majority cases. normal (read: sub-ICU) course infection, people seem undergo standard pattern memory B-cell evolution. well would long drive montana crazy beautiful, much wyoming. can't speak southern alberta would expect same. 

Would lot nothing though, although montana really speed limit. John Adams' wife made decision inoculate children smallpox, largely untested relatively new treatment could risk serious illness death. courage admired. disease terrifying enough take risk. lucky live times, new illness reminder used daily common acceptance generation two ago--that children may live adulthood could maimed disease. saying weeks everywhere British variant 30 60% lethal ... asymptomatic Covid: even tracked? asymptomatic long haul lung issues show up, etc? know people jack shit staying home actually got covid gotten vaccine. ive trying good citizen waiting like fucking idiot. I‚Äôm hopeful well. shift towards making self testing available disease disease good opinion. would love see home flu tests strep tests etc... imagine didn‚Äôt leave house find one contagious diseases? screen kid symptoms mild enough might send school... knowledge power. based self-reporting? realize biased ignore right? still Israeli passport, fly back I‚Äôm Facebook, I‚Äôm registered county well several pharmacies.

Ugh, got fucking sick people acting like human interaction outside immediate family wanting cook/clean kitchen 30th day row sort frivolity. Lockdowns bad mental health. Normal world good mental health recall article past month single dose Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine provided 60-ish percent efficacy (don‚Äôt quote that). That‚Äôs somewhat close J&amp;J single shot. makes wonder adding another shot J&amp;J would bring efficacy numbers. forget Taiwan, still pretty much virus free! Fully comfortable. tried one Michigan vaccine hunters Facebook groups? Yes, clearly lie dead Texas now. great way support them. would say giving thanks showing bravery dangerous time really lift spirits. would also recommend supporting local small independent pharmacies. much contribute local communities major pharmacy chain does. opinion healthcare better major corporate conglomerates took squeezing little guys. CVS/Walmart‚Äôs world. That's AZ EU. bring Australia contractual disputes, paid vaccine contract like everyone else. Biden president. changed. Try Ohio vaccine hunters Facebook group! Good luck! Dr. John Campbell‚Äôs update covered today. Pretty interesting summary, said vaccine rate slow European countries (in UK), likely accelerated spread rate Kent /UK Variant, almost certainly becoming dominant strain rest Europe. mass vax sites able pump people, far faster pharmacies. end march, Colorado 30k shots day mass sites, far exceeds 7 day average doses administered. checking vaccinespotter.org ? Try refreshing site every hours. Appointments pop fairly often Gaming highly recommend; help get 4th 5th lockdown Sputnik cooler name Moderna especially johnson &amp; johnson would probably go help locate closer group Eastern Missouri, FB group central MO. smoking? Ontario expecting third wave April mean another lockdown.  yawn... blame AZ that. AZ delivered fraction contracted vaccines EU could freely export. EU exported 35 million doses vaccine, UK 0, USA 0 hope Synagague continues offer virtual options &amp; return person, sometimes it‚Äôs impossible make it, sometimes wanna see real people. never said evidence widespread reinfection.
I said study showing escapes natural immune response.
And becoming common see people SUPOSEDLY reinfecting. 

AFAIK also Imperial College-USP total 100 infected Manaus already recovered coronavirus infection, ""between 25 61 susceptible reinfection P1"", said expert Nuno Faria, Imperial College London, co-author study preliminary. Source? England said fully open June 21st. Florida Texas lied death counts. extent lie known definitely lied. somewhat bullshit. We've literally decades data showing surgical masks cloth masks least somewhat effective nearly viral respiratory illnesses. Seriously, since 1970s. lied protect PPE supply hospitals. way paint it. lied. Yeah, I‚Äôm Tulsa too! Cherokee card they‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs available tahlequah sallisaw. figured they‚Äôd something Tulsa one populated areas state, may make little road trip. Awesome got though! is. virus chance mutate become deadly mutate something that's deadly. big gamble Right, nevermind don‚Äôt friends want make ones. There‚Äôs consensus. even saying complicated. open up.  Hahaha love comment I‚Äôm saving this. animals, yes. Show large scale mrna's humans. getting waitlist Duke Health UNC Health.. strictly going Groups.  Also, try www.vacinespotter.org. Onslow County‚Äôs zip 28540 damn Texas death cult .... *checks notes* .... dropping hospitalizations ...? Good god I'm tried strawman argument. definitely going disaster, makes likely. 

Here's thing - might fine opened fully last week, that's hell gamble. mask mandate hurting anyone, bars/restaurants getting current restrictions month, would fine little longer, especially since Biden's new relief bill made aid money available. 

The reason Abbott change subject disaster power grid collapsing - evidenced fact medical advisers even consulted this. 
 
So, fingers crossed get slammed third surge fueled new variants (and fingers crossed cases result new, worse variants) - again, maybe happen, risk/reward reopening heavily weighed negative. AZ removes danger dying ending hospital. renaining danger danger like headache couple days. available her. nearest pharmacies carry it. makes feel better, even liberal liberal california, estimated 75% people willing take vaccine Luckily, count Disneyland's Hall Presidents see Trump. Usually virus mutates less harmful becomes. 

While strain may detectable current pcrs setup, easily sequence strain ability test it. 

This could create another bottleneck testing end world. 

We still know efficacy vaccines strain. Vaccines likely still provide immunity. 

I'm optimistic, want nip virus arse current vaccine rollouts, contact tracing testing opportunity so. Thank sharing! Check out. Don‚Äôt hate me, islands seem leg comes handling COVID, look Hawaii, New Zealand. still great job it‚Äôs one-size-fits-all policy Oh wow highly doubt that's case. states larger distribution capabilities, states older younger populations, different states prioritizing different people.

I highly doubt there's single state government that's like ""yeah, let's get herd immunity slower"" Wait minute. Every one prevents hospitalization 100%??!! Same. go rural areas. Set phone clock ahead eastern time look Walmart‚Äôs site 11PM.

Yet even medicines hear recalls every year. area (SF, east bay) 52% chose remain distance learning, schools due offer hybrid near end March. household enjoys distance learning see point returning right school ends June 2 anyway. We'd rather leave space open others need it. 2 weeks 4 Moderna, yes?

So last 2 weeks you‚Äôre protected, still need know timeframe infected.  Well good you. used conspiracy theorist back 9/11 WTC building 7 days. It‚Äôs good research know cognitive biases makes avoid/dismiss information dislike you‚Äôll usually find closest thing truth. 

You‚Äôre far open people would self label conspiracy theorist. must truely care truth logical mind. Except women‚Äôs rights marijuana legalization. think OK profit motive.

Yeah, üòî literally said partner moved wedding whole year ""if COVID still concern NEXT summer, we'll bigger problems."" decided last days go ahead plan host it, perhaps minor restrictions changes, June. knows go, can't financially emotionally handle moving again. even think venue would let us. is, current new date Friday already booked every summer Saturday year advance. Username checks  need implement frequent testing addition masking real ventilation ...not prop door open. 

Many friends kids schools reopened. Every 4-6 weeks outbreak school close days deep clean. 

I really think testing- daily two three times week really adds additional layer protection. know who‚Äôs sick removed classroom infect others.

I‚Äôm curious believe wanting best available vaccine illogical.

Yes, public health advice tells people take whatever vaccine get - supplies limited right now, everyone demanded better vaccines large portion supply would wasted. Stating vaccines equivalent another ‚Äúwhite lie‚Äù similar telling people wear masks; comes good place, every person even partially vaccinated helps overall population, absolutely equivalent individual level.

Unfortunately, people see way presented public many countries, it‚Äôs unnecessarily creating vaccine hesitancy. far better approach promote positive aspects vaccine trust people make right choices.

In US, lower-efficacy J+J vaccine popular among people afraid needles busy schedules - single dose regimen creating quite bit demand, freeing mRNA vaccines want them. 

A similar argument made AZ - it‚Äôs lower efficacy available immediately, perfect lower risk individuals want protection sooner. conditions, many people naturally choose - inaccurate propaganda required. Yes, deserve profit, we‚Äôre still pandemic they‚Äôre already figuring ways profit more, comes across bit greedy. I‚Äôm speaking regards that. 

We different definitions means greedy. okay, lets say variants going get around tests also wont effected vaccine. means really going wipe weak vulnerable. 

How long many till happens? case regardless. fact already USA Israel's real world data: ""After initial injection case numbers increased day 8 declining low levels day 21. **Estimated vaccine effectiveness pretty much 0 day 14 rose 90% day 21 levelling off.** cause initial surge infection risk unknown may related people less cautious maintaining protective behaviours soon injection."" bit complicated look clearly protection around 11 days, take incubation period account protection begin earlier that, Israel's data suggestive people might dropped precautions early, got infections day 0-8 (cases approximately doubled), day 8-14 vaccine risky behavior cancelled net zero effect, 21 days vaccine clearly won. Extremely accurate. think morons get way wrapped ‚Äúgovernment control‚Äù terror - like people think/thought governors would never give ‚Äústay home‚Äù powers reason want everyone shut inside forever, anyone power would give single fuck make population wear masks forever kind bizarre control mechanism, whatever. token, kind see they‚Äôre coming due guys saying here. lack clearly defined committed exit strategy leaves door open fools get outraged it‚Äôs permanent we‚Äôre dystopia. church street found got much better attendence Zoom. bad virus deadlier flu else would case downvoted thread. 

FAQ: mean? 

The amount karma (points) thread Reddit account decreased one. 

Why this? 

There several reasons may deem comment unworthy positive neutral karma. include, limited to: Rudeness towards Redditors, Spreading incorrect information, Sarcasm correctly flagged /s. Trump. 

Am banned Reddit? 

No - yet. refrain making comments like future. Otherwise forced issue additional downvote, may put commenting posting privileges jeopardy. 

I believe comment deserved downvote. un-downvote it? 

Sure, mistakes happen. exceedingly rare circumstances undo downvote. would like issue appeal, shoot private message explaining got wrong. tend respond Reddit PMs within several minutes. note, however, 99.9% downvote appeals rejected, likely exception. 

How prevent happening future? 

Accept downvote move on. learn mistake: behavior tolerated Reddit.com. continue issue downvotes improve conduct. 

Remember: Reddit privilege, right. Bruh. Honestly lost faith government idiotic COVID rules. Like tf. ‚ÄúYou wear mask plane packed like sardines with‚Äù ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need wear mask eating drinking said plane‚Äù defeats whole purpose masks. Like honestly stop telling us do.

I'm kidding. That's 2 months away. 120 million doses later. it‚Äôs gone, much trumpeted ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù means new infection introductions burn quickly grow - 

Two things:

1. Herd immunity achieved threshold number folks immune. threshold calculated based transmissibility. 

2. reach herd immunity across globe, indeed drive extinct, unless natural reservoir. likely reach herd immunity several places, percolate maybe become endemic. Let save click. article summary nytimes article said basically countries want US government's AZ doses giving expect approved shortly. Saw CNN tonight 15 states least 10% increase cases since previous week. sure 7 day average what, though. Yes everything know vaccines effective likely adaptable need arise. 

There 600 documented ‚Äúvariants‚Äù since began. viruses do. focus developed since announcements vaccines part fear inc method keeping clicking/watching/ scared unwarranted degree. fact many name South African UK variant can‚Äôt original Wuhan strain different initial strains entered via California/Washington NYC evidence this. states want open everyone they're forced to. I'm American married Scottish woman - we're really hoping able fly see family Scotland August, and/or family NY Thanksgiving. Even Europe hard time, maybe we'll able safe bilateral travel US &amp; UK. Fingers crossed!  Told all, variants make new norm

People way entitled keep spreading virus creates new variants evade vaccines  explain them, give injections people specific requests sometimes problem long communicate want. want touched, clean spot apply bandaid perfectly reasonable, experienced nurse bat eyelash. Nurses seen way weirder. We, Americans, paid shit ton taxes Operation Warp Speed, helped Pfizer immensely. I, along many Americans, lot. get necessary, title still sounds pretty sinister. Late answer, adding crucial info: october 2020 (dumb) president said something like *""pharmaceutical companies looking us, we're big country. one going them? \*laughs journalists\*""*

This year comproved (*by documents*) Pfizer offered huge amount vaccines (*edit: september 2020. Yes, I'm mistaken, Pfizer looked country president said didn't*), government (Bolsonaro) turned offer think worth spend money it, sure covid would end year.

We're doomed real. 2800 registred deaths today. president psychotic crazy MF people describe day ‚Äúmet friend, outside, distance! Masked course!‚Äù say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm meeting boss socially distanced sandwich‚Äù

I hate expectation add caveats evvvvverything. It‚Äôs exhausting. people observe pandemic judgy, though, must think everyone judgmental are. goes completely agains health advice illogical many levels.

Even whole thrombosis thing happened, still would similar plave vaccines delivered. Kill fire indeed team effort, far cry 'america saving asses'. outrage!!

I'm sure went digging Facebook friends/family I'm connected following turned I'd find more. Bats? tried bats? big balls.. also said Trump, sunshine bleach guy, good job.

Listen science, politics. director general Italy's medicines authority already made statement saying overuled political decision Germany, France Italy suspend AstraZeneca's COVID-19 shots several countries reported possible serious side-effects ""political one"", director general Italy's medicines authority AIFA said Tuesday.

If lie assume rest comments also deliberately misleading. South Korea ""solved it"", Singapore has. inoculation rate per 100 much less US. UK country Europe that's nearly rate US. bad - wasn‚Äôt aware distinction, thanks pointing out. assumes perfect logistics, allowing every shot go someone rejects someone won't. doubt reality. Like 42 percent American adults obese BMI scale maybe? know Ohio's rate specifically. 

Sidenote almost 3/4 American adults overweight obese. That's bigger public health menace COVID take concrete steps address it. young people vote (which do) scenario would lockdown. Governments fear one thing others - voters. Concerning still early draw conclusions information find sketchy best. Let‚Äôs jump 100% mortality rate variant cause mass panic! concentrate vaccinating elderly see significant difference number deaths 10% total population vaccinated. help much number infected vaccinated lot people though. almost 200 countries, want vaccines, get yet. AstraZeneca still going make profit. EU country trying boycot that. Norway even part EU!

I'm sorry conspiracy theory ridiculous. Hey everybody, severe OCD COVID quite difficult, would appreciate reassurance reality check possible: walking home N95 mask checking train times someone walked smoking cigarette blew direction. turned away, still could smell smoke. I‚Äôm worried inhaled may gotten COVID. likely unlikely that? Yeah, lockdown still sucks. Third week in, looks like another month go. Fuck. Yah was. Masks never problem murica. proud must be. informed France Italy

Source? everything else suggests came idea pause time together, Italy going directly advice health agency. anyway, accept Germany stop political reasons, like described? one even wants AZ anymore anyway. someone shot explaining could be?

It understanding virus gone long-haulers, long-haul due damage done virus, still healing. could vaccine help? Opinions don‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôve stating facts. You‚Äôre trying hard instigate argument don‚Äôt really bring points besides Australian less cases? take personal credit results? Lmao live much head. ... smells elderberries. Worth mentioning that, despite 100% (!) fatality rate, indication (yet) infection transmissible virulent.

All eight patients elderly co-morbidities, concern PCR tests negative seven eight. 

It may variant widespread thought, identified serious cases, mild cough, followed recovery, negative PCR test give cause concern. 

Equally, high CFR may mean transmit easily people get sick become less mobile (see SARS1).

Even fact PCR tests negative insurmountable problem - virus lacks one markers used particular test, tests may already detect it, and/or may possible adapt testing quickly.

I would take seriously, panic. article states 8 already ill.

Although make clear sick new variant not.

They seem want avoid speculation know, looking it, panic....

Personally, shocked people done away with. informed France Italy. Everybody decide wants. Finland Poland stop. Hungary vaccinates everything Sputnik, Chinese vaccine Astra trash. Glad caught /s states age risk factors. went age, risk factors, wealth, abs political donations. could gotten pfizer actual vampires, getting enough food fully drain single person lower number incidences could leave exposed? would really safer leaving starving? Yeahhhh. feel great lying still seniors vaccinated yet. Could lot republicans state saying vax, means start open unused vaccine appointments sooner, point makes sense move allowing new group access it. trying fastest rollout, starts open slots, let peeps fill slots. states easily able predict happen advance exactly percentage group want vax. THat's probably set timetables, watch appointment signups start tail off. instance cali, everyone know eligible gotten vaccines yet gotten appointments get first shot already made appointment second shot. surprised governor opened availability new group recently since seemed like 65s wanted least already pipeline. Moderna No. That‚Äôs response weak men. Vaccines antibiotics. 

Vaccine resistance means antibody resistance get without vaccine, like P1 variant. latter part, J&amp;J come handy. Come annual physical? get quick shot see next year. One key factor vaccines prevent death. Cue people saying ""bUt VaCciNeS eFfEctIvE!!!!"" i'm sorry. kid I'd probably want remote schooling go forever. Safer cheaper way too. Really seeing downsides that. Oh never said stop masking. definitely worthwhile keep time. Gonna blame ~Valentine's Day~ Well better surprised people like start finding ways cheat way already patiently waiting long enough. even kidding right now. 

It fair younger people keep getting put incompetence State administration. Dasa + USP study. sent press, sure there's public paper.  severely underestimate much people want retain newfound power lock small businesses will. highly highly doubt California anywhere near ‚Äúnormal‚Äù May. entirely true. live Indy crazy thing though.

For months literally notice tensing face tongue hundreds times day purposely relaxing muscles. N-O would interesting run blind study give half study placebo. wonder reported improvements symptoms would compare. sure going happen. Ohio even finished first round 1b. wife I, always able get asthma blood issue, initial 1b list. got first shot today. guess, maybe dates expecting Johnson Johnson? thought typing this. That‚Äôs fantastic.

The news PNG bad right Florida never locked hard fine. Chronic Lyme Disease, Fibromyalgia men? Luckys/save mart grocers pharmacies offering appointments area check person‚Äôs area.  Great news! hospital one specialized conditions, says nothing geographic locaction different health trusts, might mean far away eachother Woo! Go Mike DeWine! Also, fuck Mike DeWine! Ohio vaccine hunters? Im one. 


Also filled lot people Dewine announced upcoming eligibility angry get appointment within literal minutes announcement. would 100% take ‚Äúmild cold‚Äù Johnson &amp; Johnson shot deal second shot side effects cousins had. One got dehydrated almost taken ER. work 4 days fever fatigue aches. know severa people refusing even get second one seeing friend group drop like flies days end. Sounds much worse mild cold. really see difference right December? that's really point. Keep desireables protected expense menial members society. ending this, would prioritizing people drive case numbers.

Ok, that's conspiratorial thinking. best guess/estimate long vaccine provide protection wearing needing get another vaccination future? good least 6 months? year? etc.

Thanks thought based socioeconomic demographics? problem. get back gaming. already citizens' patient records ? That‚Äôs simply true. Most, sure, it‚Äôs ‚Äúvery effective‚Äù South African variant. quite. link mentions pregnant women vaccinated. study shows 20 babies born vaccinated mothers February, 20 born antibodies Covid. That's theorized proven before. also another study done US, mentioned article. tl:dr

The canucks don‚Äôt want us. think article bit helpful describing differences Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J regarding efficacy, storage, cost, etc. surprised hear Moderna stored fridge temps 30 days 12 hours room temp! Canada really shitting bed vaccinations, bravo USA bouncing back bouncing turdüëåüëå Yup. Shots open Californians long know click. guy. case comment pointing vaccines developed Europe used US well. interested history following example might appeal well:

""In closing days Revolutionary War, newly independent America found deep debt domestic creditors foreign governments, notably France. stabilize shaky US economy, Continental Congress turned financial powerhouse 18th¬†century: city Amsterdam.

Dutch bankers believed promise world‚Äôs newest republic, loaned America 5 million guilders, $2.1 million, amount sounds small viewed present-day lens.

However, compared America‚Äôs gross domestic product back today,¬†that 5 million guilder loan would impactful $150 billion loan today""  actually, though studies transmissible variant gripped country last spring. Manaus experienced another surge cases December, study‚Äôs model predicts P.1 could evade antibodies previous infections 25‚Äì61 percent time, perhaps pointing reinfections driver recent COVID-19 wave."" understand started Trump administration Trump totally pro putin? Ah, thanks. presumably living reasonably close one another? Unless hospital Norway equipped deal things, suppose. Luckys Save Mart nearby? offering vaccine appointments (at least live) yeah, arduous process sure. took able get appointment. do, never think again! good luck, hope able find one soon! Roaring ‚Äò20‚Äôs let‚Äôs go! almost antibodies. there's virus left there's broad immune response caused infection left. introduction vaccine causes narrowing autoimmune response, increasing response targeted specifically virus proteins decreasing broad autoimmune response causing especially completely ridiculous. (edit: unless mean like 5-10 days)

This working theory think fits disease quite nicely, actually. much narrowing response. But, elimination extrafollicular B cells often produce autoreactive antibodies. Early Ab response lack germinal centers seen SARS-CoV-2 infection leads extrafollicular B cells undergone selection (and antibody repertoire similar seen SLE shares lot common symptoms long COVID). Vaccination allows germinal center formation, antigen-driven re-entry GCs, subsequent selection anti-self. REDDIT MOMENT pretty clear Pfizer pull Europe swamp, hope reward high standing Europeans years come.  Balkans problem, Turkey‚Äôs open whole time too. states like Montana Ohio able open eligibility everyone weeks far behind? Understood, I‚Äôm making excuses leadership. Israel isn‚Äôt even offering substantial amount doses Palestinians. offering doses return diplomatic support. change thing coming weeks either Italy enough az vaccines everyone wants one anyway. Maybe we'll red Sacramento region due ICU capacity also Orange Sacramento region high rates positive cases Blue positivity rate random number. would pitched equivalent seasonal flu shots. Many vulnerable people get really lot young people. guess. thought turning away performed poorly new variants? hoopla possible blood clots stuff too? Ugh states opening everyone end March/early April. sucks. (experts this) absolutely advising people positive COVID-19 still get vaccination. Umm way states things, locked June. Got source this? 

In US vast majority covid deaths seniors, they're eligible Medicare. 

How earth lack health insurance cause cases? federal government also contact AstraZeneca European authorities, seeking access 1 million doses vaccine already order, aim sending PNG. Ya... actually super frustrating see. Today one worst examples unused appointments I've seen (completely anecdotal measurement, eyeballed it).  Check Island Drug Oak Harbor... Scotsman here.

With US UK schedule vaccinate majority populations summer, think travel two countries going look like autumn/winter time? think we'll back kind 'normal? Well, covid \~550k, cancer 599, heart disease 659k deaths US 2019, all, good choice. looking forward 4 days office/friday home. yeah also want drink lol Thanks informative comment 100% states set date end month.

100% states set *criteria* end month. date.  virus affected day is, date component solution problem.

The government lockdown that, don‚Äôt seems curfew stay September. 
Part wishes announced clear end date like ""on x day lift restrictions matter number cases, hide grandparents basement"". bigger issue revelation vaccines (or vaccines general) might result endemic:

This world cup, matter vaccine country, winner people reject vaccines based from.  It‚Äôs also clear vaccines lower risk - AZ vaccine higher risk. UK figures would suggest Everything pretty much back normal. 
Cant dance club.

No restrictions really. tests ton people 4 weeks Johnson Johnson vaccine, 100% remained infected? ‚ÄúFormer‚Äù?
Reading posts seem extremely anxious trying overcompensate anxiety projecting fake bravado. might make sick, might also kill whoever might spread to. variant simply turn today's tests, new tests quickly created.

Noone like restrictions, alternative hundreds thousands unnecessary deaths. sincerely hope noone care would number. mean solved? virus works. stay. government lockdowns. AZ vaccine: $3/dose

Pfizer: $19.50/dose

Moderna: $15.50/ dose

There plenty reason want AZ removed market. may variant widespread thought, identified serious cases, mild cough, followed recovery, negative PCR test give cause concern.

The important point. would argue data qualify fatality rate reason. little irresponsible calling imo. high CFR may mean transmit easily people get sick become less mobile (see SARS1).

There hardly silver lining SARS-CoV-2 becoming lethal. Incubation period matters describing. know people get symptoms right away, capable infecting others figure they're infected themselves. Also, virus airborne, transmitted much easily. describing case Ebola, virus much shorter incubation period airborne, rather spread bodily fluids. SARS-CoV-2 mutated become lethal, seeing infectious easily spread is, would bad news. didn't. kids (at private school) gone year. thriving. Contrast parents breaking point year, homeschooling trying find employment keep going bankrupt. comparison mitigating virus spread expense bankrupting people ruining lives years. NONE. seems unlikely variant would developed mutation combat this, especially proven work variety coronaviruses Shut right lol unlikely. reassurance, like apply basic statistics things. instance, order gotten covid situation number assumptions made various probabilities.  
**Assumption 1: person covid.**  
Per worldometers, there's 7 million active cases corona currently US (assuming US). there's probably bc believe based tested, number also probably smaller highly contagious entire time ""active case"" large percent people probably staying home. lets still call 7 million. 7M/330M us population ~ 2% chance man corona. 

**Assumption 2: enough viral load one breath infect you**  
This one harder quantify direct studies measure this, research says need sustained contact infected person also become infected. corona spread indoors, drops drastically outdoors. fact, CDC considers ""close contact infected"" spent 15 minutes 24hr period. spent around 1 second breath stream. sake example I'll quantify say 5%, number probably *vastly* high.   
  
**Assumption 3: Enough viral load got N95 mask infect you.**  
Another harder quantify assumption, considering wearing N95 mask gold standard mask effectiveness, number probably ridiculously low. things seen however, make educated guess say chances enough infected particles make N95 mask maybe 5%.

A quick multiplication (0.02)(0.05)(0.05) brings us **0.005%** chance got infected. Honestly generous numbers well would say chances infected completely negligible. Hope soothes nerves. AZ accepted point getting it

That's quite leap. literally even suggestion countries would refuse visitors based vaccine had.

Europe suspend AZ think ineffective (it's quite clearly proven effective tens millions people), suspended unnecessary panic side effects. literally admits source hand, fucking /r/coronavirus users upvote shit blindly. 

Jesus fucking christ rub underwear ;) really award obese?   pathetic inflammatory headline. many cases missed detectable swabs?.. FFS!
It could much widespread extremely mild except elderly infirm, much like non-Covid coronavirus infections. Easiest thing world: Tell public continue. Risks still much lower Covid, vaccination mandatory. NEED TOILET PAPER! Now! Strain variant?! Quite importen difference already told read it. fact time make sick one reasons COVID problem, people spread unknowingly ton people. everyone got also got sick much easier keep control, would stay isolated moment got bit sick unknowingly infect many others. many others unknowingly spread get unlucky get sick it, possibly die, idea disease got them. 

Its show tests. Maybe want go visit parents, test hand, test negative, go parents still infect them, possibly bye bye parents.

Something like 85% 16+ population gotten vaccine, either extremely mild mild side effects, serious reaction. 1 death person may attributed vaccine (out 9mil+ doses administered). know single person hospitalized vaccination, know several hundreds got shot.

We excellent healthcare vaccine serious wide common way side effects we'd known.

Over 100 million people got shots US, data also indicates same.

It's far far safer get vaccinated. dangers COVID greater vaccine even 16.

By way, nurses paramedics may medical training, absolutely zero special medical training understanding actual working dangers vaccines, mention zero training statistics data science needed accurately parse information. doctors, master PhD's Biology better qualified answer questions. People who've diligently spent better part year locked worse, lost jobs, probably getting willing take chances virus unemployed indefinite lockdown. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* arguably almost good protecting people it. seems like millions gone hell COVID really go away weeks, vaccines genuinely helping them, that's amazing news. get locking early bad thing?

I'm sure countries would gladly take them.  I‚Äôm Washington export ban lifted US mainly helpful getting second doses everyone sooner Canada. enough every Canadian adult get 1st dose end June, goes right enough 1st dose every adult + 2nd dose 75% adults end June. We‚Äôd need 4-5M doses US end June enough everyone. Evolution mean stronger weaker. That's reductionism. Fittest survive means exactly that, fits environment better. usually means non-lethal virus high transmission rate. Yeah that's still bad dude. Canadian here. province booking appointments people 75+. rate going guess September people 40+. Freaking sucks. California, 464,249 vaccine injections administered today. one thing find plenty Utah?

Maybe ‚Äúinsanity‚Äù ‚Äî I‚Äôd happier DC waited another 8-10 weeks, least 6. know go bar serves food, cant catch covid?

Its rocket science, newsom science baby! Hi- used medic, gave injections like vaccines TB tests etc. 

Please explain condition work you. Please come back update us you‚Äôve gotten vaccine! that, safely opening economy huge boon small medium businesses. also great mental health.

I can't even imagine mentally draining must Europeans, countries experiencing spikes return restrictions. Especially get watch US open due vaccination. hope 1.5-2 months US supply beat demand they'll able dump lot vaccines European countries, giving boost. Well makes feel better extremely low risk activities long indoor places going crowded. can't bring touch pens bank, though. Well interesting see results. suppose level vaccination risk death lower current illnesses remove capacity mask mandates without covid causing issues illnesses. point found yet guess wyoming guinnie pig. implying 100% Americans donate blood missing something? worked! Plus getting random people vaccinated slightly lessen load signing bunch new people become eligible. locations tossing hundreds shots day people showing up. choice date. they're kidding I'll pissed. I‚Äôm talking throat spray buy Whole Foods. use distilled water 44 ml nose spray Walgreens put teaspoon propolis shake up. used whole pandemic works like magic. Ohio vaccinating like 60k-140k per day pretty much Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Regina big Canadian cities barren parts America.

And fair, Calgary less 8 hours Spokane.

Personally I've always surprised close Winnipeg North Dakota Minnesota. Less 4 hours Fargo 8 Minneapolis. reason always thought Canada way farther living Minnesota.  Based UK data may AZ vaccine best Yep Oh.. I'm sure would could. :)

But honestly. current pricing charge government would less people pay pocket get meds see doctor. Still pretty damn good deal. seems like we‚Äôre still year away normal life. Depressing. honestly know Moderna, Israel vaccinates almost strictly Pfizer. reason Abbott change subject disaster power grid collapsing - evidenced fact medical advisers even consulted this. 

Which seems worked, btw. wife got grandma appointment weeks ago got parents appointments week. talking bee propolis droppers usually swallow? put sinus cavities? President France spouting nonsense There's honestly reason get J&amp;J. It'll make immune death/serious illness single jab, actually fairly effective vaccine right. People downplay bad vaccine, there's thing. important everyone get vaccinated, slightly lesser efficacy matter much less people transmitting. Israel vaccinated 5 million. 20000 vaccinated study. Israel 250 times patients details data 'Merica land ~~free~~ hella expensive doctor bills. Israeli data saying 85% 15-28 days first dose.

^(Just sayin'.) funny think lot ""overly online"" people even bothered Thanksgiving/Christmas. Everything lived lives.

PLENTY people Reddit including thread.

I consider overly online person holy shit, three months home interacting handful people, watching TV, hanging Reddit get find patio bars opened back up. 

I get second dose 3 weeks done lockdowns that. anecdotal I'm saying stories friends/family outweigh studies everyone know Moderna Prizer shots got sick second shot. younger were, sicker felt. hospitalization death eliminated one shot...I guess understand two shots necessary. drag me, real question Don‚Äôt give ideas.  ex MIL masters nursing Johns Hopkins specializes vaccines. absolutely dismayed rampant anti vaxx misinformation medical community recent years. Medicine complex field. Like wouldn‚Äôt want criminal lawyer set trust fund, patent attorney represent landlord... trust actual experts. vaccines safe effective. Full stop. EU leadership inept, countries turning Russia China vaccines, desperation. literally allowed right Two weeks? know.

But yes, happened last summer, they're going far higher numbers worse variants circulating addition re-infection looking serious first infections. someone debunk this? Someone posted Facebook says it‚Äôs acclaimed scientist shit:

http://www.nakim.org/israel-forums/viewtopic.php?t=270923 Thank cogent logical response. read much pseudoscience medical advice subreddit people clearly experience scientific/medical field. another thread, read someone suggesting give heparin injections everyone receiving AstraZeneca vaccine avoid thrombosis. Wtf? Dont worry EU, UK take unwanted doses hands. Please send over. Russia's Sputnik V one know uses different adenovirus vector second shot. know CVS mark making appointment second shot. Probably depends fitness. vaccine open people comorbidities including obesity Well probably nationality researchers (just like funding) spans across globe including pre-knowledge 1000s researchers Pasteur ...

But hey, wanna take responsibility AZ business fuckup (not talking vaccine formula) go ahead ... Patients treated SaNOtize‚Äôs spray saw average viral log reduction 1.362 first 24 hours, corresponds decline around 95%. Within 72 hours viral load plummeted 99%. adverse events recorded UK trial earlier Canadian trials saw 7,000 patients testing self-administered treatment. Brazil care? report put every day usually says backlogs surprisingly today's report not. Test positive rate 2 percent hospitalizations confirmed suspected cases lowest point since state started tracking date March 29th. dont 20 years, kids age take adults ""officially approved"". letting astrazenaca ever spelled trialed kids, No, believe track serious events, meaning got symptom, severe, going test you.  suggested many European countries turning away AZ, must bad vaccine Lol idea much time I‚Äôve spent rural Ohio. source? likely kill people vaccines ever killed since like 1980. God *damn* Europe shit bed vaccines. squirting bee propolis, isotonic saline betadine nose since summer. Trust me- shit works. those. Propolis betadine potent antivirals obviously three great. super exposed even notified contact tracing times hospital exposed. hospital refused test realized mom betadine nasal swab. fully prepared wait summer saw press conference called local Health Board scheduled first Pfizer shot Monday. small breakdown immediately getting phone. go. Confirmed. Texas gonna :( Seeing lot states offering vaccine 40+ even gen pop, imagine long everyone wants one states least one shot, considering there's probably decent portion population want one moment first place. soon state's manufacturing capacity outstrips people actually want it, hope vaccines sent neighbors allies get soon possible. live Canada supply finally starting ramp up, anticipate done far behind US soon guys close done imagine start flooded doses well. Vaccine reduces tons anxiety P sure stopped using cuz p shit sure hell communism aint Agree AZ vaccine story comedy errors. However AZ end day beholden one shareholders. EU responsible hundreds millions people, incompetence really disappointing. Thanks man, hope come visit shit Would love hear response US know one point last year Florida 2x excess deaths attributed COVID, accused basically hiding COVID deaths causes refusing provide enough testing.

Some states countries look like ""did well"" numbers bogus. mean capitalism gotten vaccines developed deployed faster time human history? Capitalism? Novavax mass produced Fujifilm¬†Diosynth Biotechnologies Billingham, Teesside.

Maybe European countries bare mind make threats cutting UK Pfizer. Production happening believe, cleared distribute vaccine India doses part contract, 90million manufactured UK 10 million would imported SII. I‚Äôve heard nothing avoiding vaccines giving blood would think it‚Äôs totally fine. Wouldn‚Äôt hurt give doctor ring ask blood donation staff beginning. course people PTSD. illusion mental health crisis disappear overnight over. 

However, disease virus root causes many people‚Äôs mental health issues right now. public fear disease subsides, many people start improve. isolation ends people reconnect normal support systems, many people start improve.

The issue acting like mental health crisis happen over. mental health crisis NOW. improve it?

It sounds like you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs experiencing lot anxiety this‚Äîthat‚Äôs perfectly normal. cause problem. think lockdown policies went far, personally followed continue even careful local laws require be.

We simply cannot come together fix catastrophic situations? 1.5 years disease emerged, multiple vaccines distributed end pandemic. 1.5 years! would‚Äôve unheard point human history. Gotta think weather comes play, whether able things safely outdoors moreso NY North Dakota central air virtually everywhere even indoors air getting filtered. still follow think means countries like Spain Greece (or should) try prevent Chinese Russian vaccines allowed.

EU citizens vaccinated Pfizer, Moderna AZ able enter anyway. gain blocking people vaccinated Russian Chinese vaccines? considered ‚Äútoo soon‚Äù give vaccines pregnancy? TDaP/Flu third trimester would time line recommended covid vaccines? 8 weeks pregnancy considered soon receive it? That‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs universal though, plus there‚Äôs younger adults comorbidities group lots women it. Also AZ trial famously skewed younger. anything it‚Äôs common. good news I'm glad, biggest concern vaccine wearing soon, I'm choosing optimistic it. blood tests deeper respiratory samples seem trick, PCR tests fail:

source french : AZ vaccine actually contain virus, unlike Pfizer Moderna. British say Europe bullying AZ! :-( sure, want living US right all. faster US/UK rolls vaccines out, faster trickle world. Greece Spain two countries give zero fucks vaccine people recieved. opened tourists without vaccines last year. Came comment...left satisfied. Also warm weather, people outdoors more. Whereas Northeast Midwest it‚Äôs cold outside people meet indoors. Ah nothing exports then, plain xenophobia nationalism. Thanks clearing up. Lol write letter elected hahaha hah Lord Hamsters, find offensive. :) looks like think one New Hampshire. Ah yes mental health social skills real well was. Yup. That's 74 million Americans believe alien conspiracies.

That shit already fucked. kids going get screwed either way.

We could handled better, actual real strict lockdowns two months, nope. got this. Enjoy. good negotiation

That works class negotiation killing citizens took forever agree vaccination contracts. ""Let's open lockdowns face infectious variant running rampant! Nothing could go wrong! Ohmergerd can't believe cases rising!"" *surprised pikachu face* 
 
""Let's continually undermine pause one two available vaccines planet relying on, yet everyone else using without issue. Ohmergerd can't believe enough vaccines nobody take it!"" *Surprised pikachu face* 
 
 
What absolute embarassment EU is. post every related article? Also equating UKs exports EUs idiotic. UK production facilities 1 vaccine set meet domestic demand. Europe main production facilities approved vaccines AZ mainly meet EU supply. equitable even UK export would make hardly difference even exported everything produced. course don‚Äôt let logic get way anger/bitterness. Dutch plant even approved start production yet! God knows what's going there. ever think plants Europe would enough supply EU, UK many countries?

Most countries supplied locally india. eu UK spent domestic supply chains. right. I'd much rather central commissar charge disseminating information people people's party deems correct.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

/s go. concerned maybe look widespread currently area. there's minimal cases truly even less worried about. like indoor dining there's much traces back case-wise. I'm 26 years old. odds dying COVID high odds dying car accident way bar. odds getting severe case COVID give permanent lung damage high odds getting car accident give permanent disability.

It's hard people subreddit comprehend sometimes, lot people mindset they'd rather take risk COVID deal lockdowns. *Especially* entire elderly population able vaccinated. Telling people need stay home protect loved ones literally know anyone asking protected... remotely surprising many people want restrictions end. certain point, staying safe COVID move collective responsibility personal responsibility. data this. Could effective, could also useless untrained mind seems like particularly useful study know. I'm Brazilian. I'm assuming meant ""elude"" there, no, reports they're preventing serious infections South African variant, leaving us still vulnerable mild-moderate infections spread others vaccinated. likely booster shot designed specifically South African variant come soon compensate technology safety tested. Norwegian Institute Public Health calculated cutting AstraZeneca vaccine altogether lead delay around two weeks vaccination program (provided receive vaccines currently estimated). Norway least makes sense scrap AZ point. Im far dr posters mentioned, vax doesnt cross placenta, antibodies do. safe long history allergic reaction. probably ask dr though, strangers internet Says country literally blocked shipments going last minute... 5G signal's fantastic last couple weeks though... talking about? EU actually decent contracts Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J, export ban lifted, US Gov meddle contracts signed private companies? 

Only spoiled brats AstraZeneca promised delivery massively averse situation. Thanks awful worth 29th free considered fully vaccinated. Maternal IgG (a specific form antibodies) crosses placenta third trimester pregnancy. antibodies last baby 6 months birth work passive immunity. pregnant women us recommended get tetanus shot early third trimester (to boost antibody response Pertussis potentially deadly young baby). able wear mask without glasses fogging really? i've always given flu shot first trimester tdap second trimester.  get covid vaccine third trimester. UK barely manufacturing capacity, doses sent straight factory people's arms, total like 11 million. even drop ocean EU need thats actually ridiculous Iirc best 1 dose, case recipients UK atm since we're 12 week delay - Pfizer still supposed surpass 2nd dose EU countries Spain Greece, took great losses last summer due lack tourists, pushing certificates.

Greece also sought bilateral agreements non-EU countries signed bilateral agreement Israel tourism. might also handshake UK respect issue. 

Spain wants measure done EU umbrella instead bilateral agreements.

Another problematic case vaccine passport related vaccines produced Russia China approved EU. 

EU countries currently use BioNTech-Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca vaccines, approved use bloc. However, Hungary obtained vaccines China, Slovakia Russia.

Therefore vaccine passports approved vaccines EU, EU citizens prefer Greece, Spain, Portugal instead countries prevent pcr test quarantine return home country. Today‚Äôs first day don‚Äôt feel like crying crushing workload launched huge project. 

Although talk upstairs neighbor later tell would appreciate didn‚Äôt blast TV 11 pm work night apartment work space living space right now. Half dozen EU countries suspended giving Astra Zeneca vaccine. That's vaccine UK currently producing. hit UK hard exactly? proving point whole shit-show EU countries still offended dare leave sinking ship club? done wrong regards vaccines throw money first 100 million AZ vaccines made UK?

Maybe stop blaming countries look inwards üëç reason vaccine first place   Dude. wrong. Canadian government approved AstraZeneca adults, even age 65. employer planning offer free employees want next month. large industrial site 1000 people. would go long way community since town population around 10000. 
I guess take since soon need ‚Äú vaccine passports‚Äù order travel many things. Lol wish could consider 39 young. think plan always get doses UK plant part Ducth plant, seems UK also use doses India. really good look AZ. Maybe time look additional suppliers, may difficult contractually. also importing Pfizer EU 10 million doses India. probably wear mask flu season going forward. really big deal might actually help people. Imagine that, taking minor annoyance help people around us. world could without selfish assholes like it.

But answer terrible argument, obviously point tradeoff longer worth it. basic cost/benefit analysis, yes people die disease restrictions lifted. 

But know what? **We're fucking yet.** Pretending saying need stay quarantined masked current situation right anywhere near unreasonable saying need forever absolutely absurd. 

I dont know explain basic math works. Waiting months measurably better dropping masks right now. . reported 2 vaccines (of people dying blood clots) 13 AZ 15 Pfizer stopped Pfizer well?


Have paying attention?


There type rare symptoms people given Pfizer vaccine. comparing blood clots dishonest. Almost every Western European country disaster vaccine roll-out, sorry, trend continues summer, supposed accept lockdowns fall winter 2022 government choices vaccinations say in? outcome supposed shrug tolerate? Vaccine shopping large scale greatly reduce vaccination speed, even enough supply.

 problem small number neurotic people never convinced take anything perceive best vaccine. problem constant shaming vaccines cause people hesitant reason. think people ptsd? work government I'm sure insist BS. people fucked lockdown. Fucked enough. Fucked they're families died this. Fucked shit response levels government. People never trust lived though this.

We got proof simply come together fix catastrophic situations. proof earth lost. never get together combat climate change, instance.

We fucked species 2020 proof. young good health. Automatically means extraordinarily unlikely suffer severe case. likely die trip movie theater covid factor 50 Dad 77 almost reaction. friend 34 (honestly, already got vaccine, BS, make rules) bedridden two days 102 F temperature. cell thing mainly understood following scientists hearing around, look paper specifically talk it: Agee clinical studies, confidence hospitalisation Im talking U.K. studies.

Even though confidence interval large lower bound like 70% think Scotland study, seriously doubt would real central tendency. study authors note AZ used elderly patients Pfizer jab study could also explain variance.

Of course it‚Äôs possible Pfizer effective 2 doses, AZ‚Äôs hospitalisation protection comes quickly first dose doesn‚Äôt increase much later. one extreme clickbait-y headlines sub while. I‚Äôm doctor, doubt we‚Äôll stick original brand. company made original shots might even booster available. Well good you. He‚Äôs repeating MHRA (as well WHO, EMA etc.) said scientist quite irrelevant. great moment nationalize patents No, baby immediately begin working Amazon. UK take AstraZeneca factory.. plus.. give program COVAX.. Around 50 million ¬£ Covid vaccine. ""point"" vaccinate 11 million people without issue I'm sure ""point"" really matters. Yes renewables way forward, shutting plants end life burn coal instead productive. 

Nuclear power plants huge investment CO2 concrete alone, cheapest efficient solution keep running until.end life decommissioning building renewables. Germany did. Im super concerned, regular concerned. Im low risk group, doesnt want get virus. people reddit told dumbest thing could possibly do, would genuinely think worth not. Republican voters Republican politicians two different groups people. Die-hard conservative conspiracy theorists get vaccine, get regardless whose president. mean conservative politicians try roll vaccine everyone wants one. even concerns true, stupid, since would fewer deaths taking them. makes sense. think manufacturing process works batches, surprise batch supplies last shipment March first much bigger one, hit goal. think population density matters people think. allows virus transmitted people quickly (unnoticed, asymptomatic, etc) causes localized hospital overwhelming. know florida geography well enough know whether population centers fared worse rural areas, though recall desantis blaming rural areas one time surge (not sure one).

a couple options matter florida (but sure much) tourist cases count home areas florida many locals intentionally avoid tourist areas, become somewhat isolated whatever tourists brought in. could true florida seniors versus state seniors since florida many intentional retirement communities (the villages, among others) self contained cities people leave order get medical care, food, etc etc.

again idk much impacts, things involve politics, accusations chicanery, conspiracy theories.

florida's current case rate 20/100k per day worth remembering woods yet. ICU/hospital beds per capita would also worth considering place comparing florida got overwhelmed. florida ranks high regard don‚Äôt paperwork says vaccinated trial? film sets saying need one US approved vaccines? Source? Ok.

I propose that. Yeah also EU US. Also India. totally understand this, problem several states pushing new groups get vaccine 95%+ appointments already booked (especially within cities). causing frustration already eligible. Someone 20s Reddit able sit computer work home job refresh constantly. Someone older job requires in-person commute can't that. 

Also, supply really increased dramatically past human virus we've ever eradicated polio. Even perfect vaccine 100% adoption, long animal species act reservoir eliminate one either. cases also dropping massively Spain fraction vaccines. things complicated result measure takes time noticed. Spread FUD one going want take second available vaccine planet.

I hope ever planed great idea vilify AZ held accountable cost life thousands.

You jumped happened Norway used scheme little plan. Well back fired.

What like say two people drank coke shared train cart got ill, saying coke made ill even though millions people drank say coke fine.

You doomed people. know sleep night. literally single word comment suggests that. mother‚Äôs got COVID pregnant passed child womb? Doesn‚Äôt child come antibodies? I'm confused. 

If UK IMPORTING vaccine presumably enough. would EXPORT vaccine. Seems like Exporting 10 million doses turn around import 10 million doses would nothing meaningless feel-good measure. USA basically wide open months also cratering case numbers January - March. Stop giving lockdowns credit didn‚Äôt do. ASTRA-ZENECA produced Uk. That's question pediatrician. know Pfizer #2 kicked wife's ass, definitely bring baby bit doc. already nationalism. US UK stopping exports ready help out. production countries going well.

Being together would sharing vaccines equally helping example european AZ factories fucked up.

That's US UK doing. telling everybody else fuck push 100% vaccination countries old people still dying. 

And people hating EU? Hahahaha hate game player. EU would never ban exports law contract. everybody else it... guy wrong, though. giving proper definition term. irrelevant fiscal conservatives country, least powerless. absolute pathetic joke company. Hope get sued hell back over. Isnt exactly study discussed weeks ago? Fair point. Mine lifestyle, stomach close properly due formed around tube used be. Depends OPs situation worth shot Definitely Yes! That's ACOG encouraging pregnant women get vaccine. much evidence vaccine strong evidence pregnant women COVID passed antibodies fetus logically followed would work too. think mean smallpox. Polio, massively reduced, still occasionally flares certain areas. true. Sorry bub Pfizer Moderna orders still flowing in. AZ storage awaiting FDA approval disburse J&amp;J starting make entrance market slowly due manufacturing issues. sure downvoted, 7 day average deaths US still 1000. inconceivable want level death still happening? basically opened malls stores thats it.I personally couldn‚Äôt care less fashion stores don‚Äôt think people want go every single day.Sports,gyms,bars...are closed things people socialize properly Maybe, unless tested babies antibodies, first one actually tested get credit. One interesting things far know far UK received smaller proportion order due AZ EU (About 25% due delivered right taking account 10 million India compared 30% 40% EU. someone accurate figures please let know)  

&amp;#x200B;

Of course threat rather empty given risk reciprocation UK restricting export components Pfizer vaccine, risk licencing Oxford vaccine challenged legally (doubtful Oxford would try would succeed , could lot damage meantime) previous attempt arrange things stop vaccines going EU UK blew spectacularly implementation backpedaled record time, would even worse attempt (The EU bringing legal action UK extending grace period relatively loose enforcement NI protocol goods going NI rest UK, would help case reputation bring much significant changes unilaterally) agree, provided permission revoked people already received 1st dose offered 2nd. utmost importance people trusts vaccines part vaccination program though case AZ currently. think actually able vaccinate people scrapping new vaccinations AZ vaccine. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

If detectable via PCR, way going find wild case gets serious enough warrant hospitalization heightened level testing/scrutiny entails. hate shitbag human, statement made actually one better ones. It‚Äôs net good however spin No, open source like Oxford wanted do. guaranteeing pharmaceutical company never invests vaccines 10 million doses India.

‚ÄúA Singaporean woman, infected novel coronavirus March pregnant, given birth baby antibodies virus, offering new clue whether infection transferred mother child.‚Äù

[Singaporean gives birth baby COVID-19 antibodies: Whoa. vaccines close approval? yeaaa, seriously terrified first read it. point there's need halt exports. even doubtful about? 

If restrictions, COVID cases would lot worse? COVID cases increased, think everything would operating same? Flu shot given flu season starts, regardless trimester :) That's good. me! Yeah sub used absolute shit. Time open 1 year enough. described blood clot related events

Nothing dishonest. 


Of course is, banned they've found blood clots. They've suspended they've discovered increase specific type blood clot addition symptoms link cases. 28 events 26 million doses.

In Germany, found 7 cases 1.6 million people vaccinated, would expect 1 case normally. Norway lot higher: 4 120 thousand. points towards issue. additional symptom low platelets makes even suspicious. also found mostly people healthy relatively young.


Many types blood clots common. Pretending cases thrown statistic dishonest. 



 Surely companies making billions vaccine would reason want discredit profit vaccine maybe that's paying attention



So conspiracy theory Pfizer poisoned people, bribed health authorities experts Norway, Denmark, Germany, France, Spain, etc. ? 


sounds likely. Suspending vaccine done harm good


Countries like Norway much vaccine anyways, stored weeks clarify situation. bottleneck right supply, there's nothing cause long term impact. fine. Weird 4 weeks ago big delay causing every province move single doses delay second doses. week another delay expected increase next week. Everything live still either closed limited capacity. sure that‚Äôs going change summer. 18 tiers go. I‚Äôm personally looking forward Cyan go back flying kites every Tuesday. Here‚Äôs guess - we‚Äôll looked hoarding short term, we‚Äôre going become premier exporters/donators within months begin supply outpace demand.

By end pandemic, we‚Äôll viewed contributed significantly (because will) Right you. However, place work got shot every employee (around 750). 686 turned shot. percentage par rest state terms adoption. could go right pharmacy within 3 hour drive get whatever shot I'd like without appointment. however really agree would make asshole. given opportunity take shot back January due essential worker turned since work home want cut line. circumstances feel like taking additional shot would fine. Like said amount folks getting shot extremely low would like protected possible order get see family again. factory expected export 2/3 production, stupid never happened. vaccine can't get matches tinder what's point it. ""He must \[insert description average American here\]"" enough immunity. Combined spread contagious variant. French variant isn‚Äôt showing tests cause concern? Doubtful There's 2 options!

/s enough money made AZ. matter they'll still whine end queue decide buy Novavax. thats works,otherwise would say ‚Äú10millions vaccines shipped Ireland‚Äù. company would reduce price instead keeping extra profit themselves... Europe seeing third wave Fine. Block exports factory exporting vaccine anyway.

Yeah that's point. Extraordinary failures requires extraordinary distractions scapegoating. Ursula's failures vaccines quite extraordinary. That's thing good at... blaming people. people stopped caring, mods got marching orders telling over, left cranks.

It's reduce risk outbreak, rather specific measure targeting US. Contracts. Oh that's good, got link? Here's problem charts like this. take account differences trials - huge. Yes, there's note bottom people look efficacy numbers compare other. can't.

For example, J&amp;J trials included older people health problems. conducted post-variant. Moderna/Pfizer tested much earlier, variants (or spread widely) used people young healthy.

There comparison them, terms efficacy, real-world data. amount vaccine available exponentially growing. True, worrying thing Attica 87% increase despite already very, high concentration virus. ICU 100% virus still doubling single week, hard lockdown. 

My family looking way country blows things going very, wrong. remainer can't argue brexit helped UK vaccine program. actually happy see something good come it.

The protocols made lots scientific backing choose them, still set stone. J&amp;J might effective 2 dose protocol, don‚Äôt data that. Similarly data 1 dose Pfizer Moderna also limited actual trials 2 doses. 

J&amp;J might good Pfizer compare dose dose, don‚Äôt data Pfizer say that‚Äôs true sure looks case. comparing data different protocols. needs upvotes gain visibility.

Also we've since yesterday found tests detect new brittany variant fine. You‚Äôre right. Sorry. That's quite spread US can‚Äôt trusted hand vaccines touch US shores. need make EU. Sees arguments replies insult. Damn big brain debater here. Well, suspension advised vaccine safety institute, published (translated via DeepL): seven cases (as 15.03.2021), **a special form severe cerebral venous thrombosis associated lack blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) bleeding** diagnosed connection vaccination AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccine \[...\] 
The number cases AstraZeneca COVID 19 vaccination **statistically significantly higher number cerebral venous thromboses normally occur non-vaccine population**. purpose, observed-versus-expected analysis performed, number cases expected without vaccination time window 14 days compared number cases reported 1.6 Million AstraZeneca vaccinations Germany. **About one case would expected, seven cases reported. \[...\]** 
All experts unanimous opinion pattern could identified connection AstraZeneca vaccination implausible. 

So Germany cluster rare side effects well expected number cases general population. also affect low-risk Covid group (20-50 years old, mostly lower range that. context, we've less 30 fatalities 20-29 age range three deaths already). 

What institute needs evaluate background side effect (bad charge, medicine reaction something else, specific preexisting conditions increase risk, actual risk occurring) reevaluate risk/reward vaccine. could cross-reaction specific medication mostly taken younger women, case slap ""DNI take XY"" move on. Could find cause end deciding risk high low-Covid risk age groups they'll get taken AZ rotations. decide risk low enough long people informed risk exactly (i.e. say ""there x chance happening"") vaccinations continue normal. 

AFAIK UK mostly using AZ older people, right? Could mainland Europe seeing younger vaccination pool. Could problems manufacturing. Could nothing. need actually follow normal procedure figure out. People saying ""The vaccines follow normal safety procedures!"" along they're still suddenly issue?

Idk guy would think otherwise California whole cases still decreasing. problem masks. said mandatory vaccines consider human rights violation.

I also think misunderstanding right life. mean government keep safe diseases. means government can't execute without due process. Forming opinions based area alone dangerous. **Is going theater big risk?**

How everyone going see movie? already bought tickets opening day go see Godzilla vs Kong, excited go. Ive talked several people get wildly different opinions.

Some say safe go. Others say safe. say safe go keep mask on, others say ok take seat.

The theater 40% capacity, wont anyone sitting next 2 seats right left, someone behind me. go food shopping every 2 weeks, much people grocery store movie theater, everyone masks on.

So question is, foolish go theater see movie eat popcorn Im there? know always risk, dont see high.

Edit: felt like add extra info.

My showtime 4pm March 31. first showtime day, one seat since Sunday (the place closed Monday Tuesday). community Vestal NY, (I dont know look covid cases area). wear mask, greatly fogs glasses cant see. always take glasses Im food shopping, take movie, wont able see it. also plan eating popcorn, dont intend touch anything popcorn bowl hands. asked theater many people showing showtimes, said generally selling out. 40% capacity, everyone 2 empty seats right left, max 20 people theater. theater pretty spacious, look like somone sitting behind me. might able change seat, one next angle. high 30s, vaccinated, quite good health, dont pre-existing things make covid extra bad me. roommate getting second vaccination shot April 2. food shopping, would time apartment, Ive hermit past 6 months. movie big deal me, option see crappy home tv. wont able get full vaccinated movie theaters. Even covid, ever went movies maybe every 3 years, would one times, goes show big movie me.

So overall question is, whats likelihood catching covid, go movie take mask theater, eat popcorn? muck risk life it? Seems like someone doesn‚Äôt understand difference positive negative freedoms...

No, today's vaccinations solve future pandemic, that's true. today's vaccination strategy policy used basis handle future pandemic situation.

My health system cancel 90k first dose appointments hasn‚Äôt making weeks. numbers compare vaccines?

I'm asking read article recently made comparison claim Pfizer significantly safer, AZ incidents received much wider media attention. Unfortunately know read it.

The AZ vaccine already go testing phase successfully, personally increasingly leaning towards believing there's sort intentional lobbying behind this. us split two lanes depending first second dose. checked credentials (for first dose) put sticky note bright paper corresponding brand vaccine you‚Äôre getting windshield. pull forward garage attendant directs lane corresponding color paper. their, double check ID, give shot, write time (15 minutes later) sticky note. pull forward lane cars leave attendant front waves away time sticky comes up. Nurses periodically checking 15 minutes shot. Results: estimated 15.9 million (bootstrap 95% CI, 15.5-16.5 million) asymptomatic undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred United States September 30, 2020.

Conclusion: findings cross-sectional study suggest that, based sample otherwise healthy population, overall number SARS-CoV-2 infections US may substantially higher estimates based public health case reporting. recent study blood doners US found 20% Covid anti bodies, lines US testing actually detecting 40% cases. Compared Christmas? Absolutely. Week week? We‚Äôre actually seeing increases. live NZ national lockdown since March-April 2020. 2 week lockdown Auckland August 10 days February 2021. 

And Auckland-only lockdowns Level 4 full lockdowns, quite relaxed Level 3 ones still free go want masks suggested (we mask mandates NZ, never have). 

Other short times zero restrictions, liberal rules world full stadiums clubs, masks normal school levels. 

Sweden's death rate 1,299/million. New Zealand's 5/million. Oxford Stringency Index rates Sweden's measures 69.44 moment. NZ 22.22 even last 2 Auckland lockdowns reached 62 index, still lower Sweden consistently months now. actually NZ free country, thanks rare, short lockdowns.

Therapy needs accessable normalized, trauma needs discussed adults circles cycle trauma needs halted. I'm saying *you* (meaning Brits general) care, lots friends across UK, hell lived years myself.

What I'm saying ever since Brexit become mentality UK media reporting news biased paint UK better light. EU news, we're best UK bunch tight gits withholding vaccine example.

The outrageous story, papers/ads/whatever sell.

Take vaccine example, UK reported EU failed come proper plan strategy, whereas EU reported strategy great - Britain's fault forced AZ halt shipments etc.

The truth likely lies somewhere middle.

Same this. I'm certain UK news would bit keep British public vaccinating without care right now. certain big Euro media would like stick previous ally. Again, truth lies somewhere middle. Norway part EU (yes, EEA, EU) follow made German chancellor told them. goes Sweden, EU take every opportunity available opposite Brussels tell them. mention Sweden done thing entire pandemic, yet also decided, night, stop AZ vaccine EMA could re-evaluate see what's what.

To get significantly reduced chance severe symptoms near future. _quite_ 100% real world. Israel, whose population received Pfizer vaccine, seen 429 hospitalizations 99 deaths among fully vaccinated.  layman‚Äôs understanding AZ didn‚Äôt modify spike protein J&amp;J, Moderna, Pfizer did: like lockdown forever then?

Unless governments stop forcing society wagedom economy. vaccines anyway AZ delivered little We've open two weeks point, way early infections start ticking up, surprised cases start increasing summer. guess question long sequence ""recognized"" primer? seems like lots AZ astroturfing days. Maybe doses sent SA. Oh wait. Come guys, want variant protection, valid reasons outside data controversy blood clot news. Older people weaker immune systems. That‚Äôs fewer side effects also risk begin ofc Probably flu February 2020. bad season everyone thought Covid Yes, continue evaluate vaccines work real world. they're approved we're basically creating massive expansion data. say, stop studying effective vaccine approved - continue data analyzed afterwards. 

That lets us make informed decisions government purchase moving forward benchmarks be. 

This kind graph over-simplified rather useless making future decisions produce.  Kinda weird much issue countries solved virus problem. Also killed less people. short answer is, protected vaccine got covid line.

The longer answer is, benefits vaccine far far far outweigh small possibility get covid line. mention - anxiety causes sleep disturbances cause MANY physical symptoms.

But certainly people specific longer term physical symptoms. skeptical ""Long COVID"" discrete thing can't detected diagnostically. folks responsible persuading lockdowns. AstraZeneca's under-fire COVID-19 vaccine dealt another blow, confirmation simply work preventing mild-to-moderate infections caused South African variant virus. 

South Africa halted planned rollout AstraZeneca vaccine early February, evidence emerged might effective local mutated version SARS-CoV-2 virus, called 501.V2 B.1.351.

The variant number mutations spike protein - pointy bit virus uses enter human cells - make infectious. 

The decision halt rollout vaccine - also known ChAdOx1 nCoV19 - made based early data study scientists University Witwatersrand Johannesburg. full details research peer-reviewed, published Wednesday New England Journal Medicine.

In study, 750 people got two shots AstraZeneca vaccine 717 placebo. got vaccine, 19 went develop ""mild-to-moderate"" COVID-19, compared 23 placebo group. 42 COVID-19 cases, 39 B.1.351 variant.

All-up, gave efficacy 10.4 percent.

""A two-dose regimen ChAdOx1 nCoV19 vaccine show protection mild-to-moderate COVID-19 due B.1.351 variant,"" study concluded. 

In contrast, rival vaccines made Pfizer Moderna shown 90 percent efficacy original strain virus, though ongoing concerns might work well B.1.351. 

While studies found AstraZeneca vaccine - like others - effective preventing severe illness death, mysterious condition known 'long COVID' possible even mild infections. People showing symptoms also believed infectious catch virus get sick, potentially putting people risk.

The AstraZeneca vaccine, developed conjunction University Oxford, troubled development. Mistakes made trial phase, led volunteers getting injected wrong amount; effectiveness trials quite good achieved vaccines made rivals; recent reports could causing blood clots, prompting several countries stop using it.

The World Health Organization (WHO) urged countries keep using it, saying there's evidence linking use vaccine blood clots, even was, current data suggests risk still extremely low compared posed COVID-19. 

ChAdOx1 nCoV19 cheaper produce easier transport store vaccines developed far, making key weapon WHO's arsenal COVID-19, particularly poorer countries. 

Most vaccine manufacturers expect they'll need make booster shots new variants virus emerge, available months, least. medical experts predicted COVID-19 become endemic like influenza - another disease stay, constantly mutating evade existing vaccines. 

Its deadlier predecessor SARS wiped killing less 1000 people infectious SARS-CoV-2. alright now, ""new strain"" thing temporary fear, comment main thread tells everyone much worry keep vaccination rates going, despite d__mers say ""2021 doomed year"", thats projecting wish pandemic continue longer since fear returning normal life. effective preventing severe cases, hospitalisations deaths. really extend next week hope people go streets protest.

Highly inappropriate. state reddit page, I'm able ask anyone giving JJ vaccine. However, able call local places ask. traveling far lot medical conditions, told gonna single double trip. Depending far is, could make huge difference. that's angle I'd play phone. Sorry, Maine ive saying end April latest one would care rules, lots already happening specify physical well-being, chose example non-physical well-being. Raising child unquestionably impacts father's physical well-being, too, though. Certainly much birthing mother, course.

But thing COVID get vaccine, I'll protected virus. idea unvaccinated person putting physical well-being risk moot. 

Only people can't take vaccine medical reasons would still risk contracting unvaccinated person. probably equal greater risk lot diseases COVID healthy enough even get vaccine.

The idea forcing people get vaccinated wishes achieve herd immunity, order eradicate virus. That's noble goal, nobler still preservation maintenance human rights. one ridiculous idea scrap nuclear power go coal Fukushima disaster. claim anything wants. gets people vaccinated I‚Äôm claiming it‚Äôs him. mean cares really? study severe cases either group?

Viruses mutate. new flu shot every year reason. EMA say keep using it. I‚Äôm getting mine Friday! ""Everything good happens next four years vaccine developed watch get it"" might bridge far cognitive dissonance wise, even Trump's base. punish people helping, stop helping. Looking number vaccines brought market pretty clear free market approach development manufacture vaccines incredibly successful. time Pfizer fills current orders, there's going half dozen competitors, huge hike like what's usually done monopoly patenting held possible. BILLIONTH time, cares many new cases are?? Grandma vaccinated. There‚Äôs risk hospitals getting overwhelmed.

THAT‚Äôs goal posts. suspended vaccine grounds might 1 460,000 *one-time* risk generally non-fatal complication.

The risk go slightly young female. Also, virus something happens involuntarily, whereas vaccine something needs done voluntarily, people generally evaluate risks equal footing. Everything tabloid age clicks.

Someone said elsewhere scientist found studying recently deceased. 100% mortality rate.....among week contracted already dead. ive held stance since early days pandemic, country wants steal pfizer moderna big pharmas shit make copycat vaccine, good -76.8 54.8 kind big confidence interval. still, good two-dose regimen ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine show protection mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due B.1.351 variant

Simple scheduling-window based prioritization highly effective allocation efficiency. know somehow complicated. hope everyone wants one US UK get vaccine soon. suspect I, 32 year old relatively healthy male living Japan get one 2021 bums out! Also, US poor job controlling cases, seroprevalence probably really high. tough measure, learned multiple studies given wildly different results. Italy one form lockdown another since mid October, we're hardest form lockdown passed one year anniversary first, strongest, lockdown. know happening reopen everything summer, would've preferred three months heavy lockdown seven months off, light heavy lockdowns. This, plus fact vaccination rollout strategy absolute disaster, put many terrible mental state (myself included) Pretty great! Planning see family soon one unvaccinated brother low risk basically precautions needed. got J&amp;J vaccine couple weeks ago, ability getting Pfizer tomorrow (my work nowhere got clinic together vaccine everyone even planning taking it. also live area hardly anyone taking one vax's surplus galore) get safe side? I'm high risk individual around high risk (but already vaccinated) folks, would purely abundance caution. warned bloc ‚Äúwill reflect whether exports countries higher vaccination rates us still proportionate‚Äù.

Vaccine trade war come. Haha, can't win em all! may asymptomatic Covid similar time frame, tested. Got figures back up? even true research specific vaccines carried Europe. Look, whole point -again- team effort. fist comment nonsense. try twist words is. falsehood asserting? cry ? again, take grain salt plan get vaccine myself, think moral wrong violation human rights force someone get vaccinated wishes.

Germany actually speed limits, even Autobahn days. Driving fast never right there, anywhere.

I live US. even health care stubborn dedication freedom personal responsibility (and politicians assholes). certainly mandatory vaccinations. think should.

Especially coming US perspective, idea government cares much everybody's health would force unwilling get vaccinated, simultaneously taking hands approach health care people often die preventable diseases, rich can't even choke down. don‚Äôt know exactly apple cider read balances PH stomach. helps throat tightness. Ah right, thanks. old Pharmacist? Spain, insurance triaged moment urgent cases (which fair enough given circumstances, something urgent I'd want go immediately).

I'm move wanted go beforehand wait. may agree points wrong, don‚Äôt back claims act less mature 1st grader. Grow up. feel way lol. think conspiracies dumb I'm starting think want pandemic end. help politicians making private money masks. yeah could reason extend pandemic. Maybe invested amazon something, definitely making money pandemic trust anymore. think got NEJM yesterday. think middle ground here. want press censorship important time like this. Debates healthy necessary part democracy, important even pandemic. Right, understand that. less passive choices. 

But actively volunteering child guinea pig science experiment, way different. vote out... oh wait. Thyroid fine. It‚Äôs throat tightness spitting food. It‚Äôs reflux (god forbid hital hernia ulcer) There‚Äôs chance scenario, would personally categorize pretty small one. Serious question, Bolsonoro gain this? actively wanting x amount Brazilians die? Yooooo Using percentages hides deaths families facing. Keep trying hhaah point mostly American capital produced vaccines. Sorry? definitely short sighted open back fully early. Look happening Germany, UK variant reached Texas. wait another month two 50%+ fully vaccinated. don‚Äôt think unreasonable Pfizer future would like normal market price evaluation product

It‚Äôs car random commodity, it‚Äôs life saving medicine. makes non-optional necessity, perverts ‚Äúnormal market price evaluation‚Äù product. makes price unreasonable.

When someone necessary life saving tool, market maximize profits, maximize lives. need maximize lives instead put profit maximization back burner. think it‚Äôs actually people read article headlines. I'd like see source go future confirm actually happened. Every single thing gone wrong point. Plus supply half problem; also distribute get people. really huge problem Germany since top priority following rules actually vaccinating people. know US, people hang around standby lists hawk doses people didn‚Äôt show up? Germany, throw doses trash. would willing shut everything indefinitely chase last 1% one group ‚Äúprematurely‚Äù open eligibility group lesser priority. Pfizer vaccine blood clot cases suspended put investigation? Dude, sucks, live? La it‚Äôs bed medical appointment, dental unfortunately wait month üôÑ  elevated risk people home vaccinated planning get vaccinated? Wouldn‚Äôt protect them? peoples' choice though. government stopped vaccinations, enforces lockdowns.

This democratic all. Never said anything lockdown order. said mandated lockdowns. according this, roughly 2:1 ratio undetected detected cases. triple number actual cases, adjusted proportionally, risk serious death illness disease would 1/3 current estimates. Good news terms mortality rates disease. 

But also means natural herd immunity still long way (roughly 30% moment)...so less reason get vaccinated. think reclassifying Long COVID form Post Viral Syndrome would help discourse without dismissing hand. There's lot frightened people think issues long viral infection unique COVID, therefore makes thrice scary virus history. reality plenty people suffer issues viral infections long supposedly ""over"" infection. study discussed back. gone peer review, results ""final"" way.

The conclusion AZ vaccine essentially impact rate mild/moderate COVID-19 cases (although confidence interval extremely wide, -77 55) South African variant.

However, information whether vaccine prevents hospitalizations and/or deaths variant. trial group rather small young, simply severe cases draw conclusions whatsoever from. define ‚Äúmany‚Äù ‚Äúmany‚Äù meaning still dying yes, stupid assume numbers zero claiming are, rates decreasing. 

Cases nearly 80% US January, deaths nearly 60%. hey, that‚Äôs Center Disease Control, knowing mind ‚Äúsocialist hero‚Äù walked bathroom went urinal. two guys chatting entire time, never thought it.

go wash hands realize masks chins.

If bathroom less 5 mins, risk could catch something? Yes! happens Africa well. Basically need get better geography. Absolutely true. conservative least. really cares one thing - himself. look political career - GOP, Reform, Democrat, GOP, etc. He's place. Much like way governed. According Forsa snap poll broadcasters RTL ntv, 54% respondents said decision Health Minister Jens Spahn right. Nearly four 10 said reaction excessive. 39% thought suspension wrong.

A whole lot percents. Almost half people think excessive. Depending want headline read guess. weeks ago never actually checked eligibility. put food worker, could get it. got mine never asked credentials even though ready. long list, that. Okay [I‚Äôll spoon feed 

NO STATES LOCKDOWN ORDER RIGHT AFAIK UK mostly using AZ older people, right?

No. Many adults ages received AZ vaccine UK Texas starting report cases UK variant. take time wild west fully expect cases deaths rise. 1. low risk covid group, get it. But,

2. unlikely would even exposed COVID, case numbers dramatically down, distancing effect, etc. sure understand saying. countries want receive tourists, surely interest vaccinated people requirements lax possible. would interested preventing approval Chinese Russian vaccines? keeps I'll go doctor.

Right crazy though, even get dentist appointment. No, necessarily protected life. However, antibodies may play role first months life protect child covid infant young receive vaccine. I‚Äôm afraid Europeans going go ‚Äúanti-lockdown‚Äù refuse cooperate. fuel rise variants (not mention extremist political movements).

Lockdowns crude tools make sense stopgap, aren‚Äôt sustainable long-term solution.

What EU needs right putting resources vaccine production. throwing everything project months ago. Throat tightness? Check thyroid levels. work though? would taking acid calm stomach acid? would apple cider vinegar different vinegar? What's mechanism? agree more. Oh no, deadly virus affect family? must special. Lmao Got first jab Pfizer yesterday! Arm little bit sore noticeable side effects otherwise. fucking ready shit over. point exactly? Sure European US capital makes research possible, team effort. previous comment complete nonsense. tell 'em Hank! you‚Äôre white foreigner korea expect treated badly subsidising buy something, that's like saying police subsidizes autoindustry, buy patrol cars.
When becomes relevant year half dozen vaccines ok market scaled production, would anybody Pfizer's expensive vaccine instead five competitor's? know small risk? incidence serious adverse events balanced vaccine placebo groups.  nothing ... placebo effective.

That's means, SAE's anything unrelated thing tested, like possible side effects unrelated events(e.g heart attacks). Portugal. consider people changed minds?

I supported first lockdown ""flatten curve"" year now. wife lost job, found something since, brother lost job two young children provide for. lockdowns far damaging coronavirus itself.

Not everyone secure, home-office remote job, every government provides generous welfare citizens. Check lockdown privilege. looking something wrong AZ found something plausible coming thread today call thing - Pfizer two weeks realize massive boost output, hit goals, according CDC's allocation data.

I can't help wonder there's something we're missing. in, data indicative doses companies shipped? count doses federal government keeps control uses, something? 

To make things confusing, [as recently last Pfizer still confident hitting goals: result efforts incorporation updated 6-dose label, we're target make 120 million doses available shipment across U.S. end March additional 80 million doses end May.

Wow quite opinion. even wasting time subreddit like opinion can't impact anything might well try? Don‚Äôt forget: 2 Pfizer factories world produce vaccin: one US isn‚Äôt exporting anything outside USA one Belgium. vaccin Pfizer outside US comes single plant. Nuff said sharing helping others. think really worth stressing point. General availability matter weeks. want wait, make much difference. Welcome dystopia allowed built. Oh see, didn‚Äôt realize wasn‚Äôt extension last summer‚Äôs ban. think Americans saying brits well produced soil... hardest hit country world. country EU BTW spent last year telling get shit together. seems vaccinating population ASAP best way that. Notice desperate attempt try tie sentiment former president too. 

So desperate.

Reality people left side waking realizing it‚Äôs safe chill little bit. also causes vessel damage children. It‚Äôs death. there's one thing scientists AZ really knocked park antenna design came vaccine. enough people appreciate skill required that.

/s (just case obvious) LOL J&amp;J move fill finish Germany (expect delays), even knew US would steal doses. politican population would inclined take drastic measures erase flu. nonstarter, grabs attention. Seriously, Sweden? saying essence is: send us 40 million doses vaccine, send back 40 million doses vaccine. 

That logic seems cyclical. saying US export non-EU countries? 27 EU countries (minus Malta) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway received 62.2 million vaccine doses administered 46.8 million 15th March.

U.K. administered 27m doses 16th March.

So takes responsibility 15m doses unused EU? Japan prepares expand scope coronavirus vaccine rollout entire population, 62.1% people expressed willingness receive shot, recent online survey Tokyo-based medical school poll, conducted January team Tokyo Medical University, also found women younger generations less accepting vaccines, underscoring need government reassure educate large sections populace safety.

37,9% skeptical want avoid kind vaccine! 

Higher rates skepticism observed medical community! point appears nothing wrong blocking exports, since US seems allowed that. one party play game. besides point. America largely never truly locked reason 500k people died last year.

No. Lockdown jack shit that. States locked hardest better didn't. like countries lock similar death rates did. Lockdowns waste time unless remote island authoritarian regime. Remember people post symptoms likely extreme end it. it‚Äôs impossible it‚Äôs given. Either way better getting covid.  really sad hard know fact fiction days cause media sources world leaders lie us slant words deceptive still lie imo. Let‚Äôs remember: execs elected board represents shareholders. shareholders want share price go up. don‚Äôt look maximize shareholder value, get fired. Embarrassing even though CNN showed EU signed deal UK 2 UK facilities contracted produce EU.

The UK reached initial agreement Oxford/AZ months EU. also suggest read contract exactly EU signed say think. centralized plan, 50 countries, plus DC. point United States geographically far away China Europe, yet let virus sides. Preventing virus spread geographical problem, it‚Äôs one governance. Ask OBGY, would think risk getting covid higher outweighs need give passive antibodies fetus. JnJ also produced US would little effect Macron regarding AZ people 55 (or 65?) blunder based incorrectly interpreted trial results.

A stupid statement, one accounted Macron EU. Yes, super new (in LA County) still different Florida, fully open while. would better 100% everyone done, point. think anyone really considers healthy 30 year olds ""most vulnerable"". Yeah wanna hear someone live China 27 EU countries (minus Malta) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway received 62.2 million vaccine doses administered 46.8 million 15th March.

U.K. administered 27m doses 16th March.

So takes responsibility people dying 15m doses go unused EU? ""Available shipment"" reported shipped numbers likely gives couple days even week buffer there.  Sending European doses US BOTTLING mean going back, ZERO US supply. reason EU upset added transport time delays cause. believe residents only. Thank info much. Really informative. agree 100%. EU played. really hoping EU grows spine. I'm Serbia we're accession talks EU. want us join organization can't protect fight citizens!!! EU sort Defense Act (called article 122, sexy)

Very sexy ask me. Invoke article 122 stop humiliation! besides point. America largely never truly locked reason 500k people died last year. Making sarcastic statements like let's keep everything locked beside point never really even happened here. restrictions yes... lockdowns part specific areas

A lot more. Indian firms exported 10m UK alone. even offered EU (not yet taken up).

In UK, capacity export vaccines moment. used domestically - UKs vaccine production capacity great. Another 529k doses administered today, expecting see even larger figures next weeks experience surge supply.

I certainly can't hear ""all Europe"" rejecting vaccine ""all Europe"" stopped administering ""the EU leaders"" conspiring AZ etc. Thank saying this! decent chance BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine approved mainland China cooperation Fosun Pharma. already authorized Hong Kong Macau.

So would least one Western vaccine would allow travel China. not, studies shown real protection least 11 days first shot. 2-3 weeks really comes on, pretty much golden time get second shot think large pandemic famine pretty much two things EU would serious problems with. easy logically come X country vaccines government asked exporting vaccines giving people country.

It always going end countries selfish one another causing whole system show cracks. Interesting. think it‚Äôs important characterize people broadly.

I live fairly conservative area, people know fall 4) antivax, not
concerned enough jump hoops. OR...or...we could wait 3 months

I've waiting ""just 3 months"" year now. Yeah countries already that, remind many vaccine able produce way ? even flu mutates faster COVID. COVID read-proof mechanisms prevent mutating wildly flu. According [this shy million doses shipped US. even heard J&amp;J send doses produced EU back US fill finish, able get doses back EU export ban. source right though.

I agree ban EU would impose would geopolitical consequences (which quite ironical). certainly want create deadlock one country waiting component country banning exports on. Indeed. Belgian plant need retooled expand production there, entire EU received slightly lower number deliveries. recently, Belgian plant producing Pfizer-BioNTechvaccines entire world outside US. Variants science faith. still misleading.  Experts saying give couple months proper vaccine coverage. That's it. That's last step.

I've heard ""a couple months"" consistently long time now. Well, far they‚Äôve stood firm destroyed UK fishing industry. They‚Äôve caved. UK government done nothing it. Finance next. sadly, lot UK‚Äôs wealth taxes driving from. helps Bosnia Serbia lot vaccines? article says canton Bosnia 50,000.  90%... far that. Like 99.5% least. Anyway, like would said, volume change objective fact vast majority people, sniffles. 100m people got attacked bees. Thousands would probably die...This still make bee venom (in normal amounts/in normal people) lethal.  


The overall death change that. Yeah article makes pretty clear. However data shown leaving longer gap doses works well first dose still provides protection. ‚ÄúSincerely, Greg Abbott‚Äù Check vaccinespotter.org - that‚Äôs lot folks using find appointments searches multiple sites. r/coronavirus 2 month epidemiology program turned lot phds lately Got second Pfizer dose Monday side effects exact first- nothing sore arm day after.

Seems like looking internet talking friends fully vaccinated, second dose always turbulent.

Anyone else easy second dose? say anything terms body‚Äôs ability effectiveness absorb vaccine?

I‚Äôm healthy guy late 20s vitiligo (not sure matters autoimmune disorder) source pass sub-reddit filters? obey social distancing/mask mandates keep driving surge.

What surge? mean consistently falling cases, hospitalizations, deaths? Cuz I'd like keep surge going. also one benefit supported available evidence.

But hey, take word it. WHO's stance towards social distancing NPIs late Fall 2019 majority waste time reasons outlined 

That pretty broadly accepted view panic took time year ago, academics started salivating CCP's apparent ""success"" containing virus welding people inside homes. Source dpa, text German. Apparently mulitple EU Sources doubts. gonna get many foreign visitors. unused doses either due temporary suspension AstraZeneca doses kept 2nd shot (especially Moderna delivering 1-2 times month) 1st dose only, full figures released today showed total 25,273,226 people received first doses vaccine 16 March, 1,759,445 second jab. Either way whole kerfuffle makes sense.

If UK imports (meaning need) 12 million doses, imports 12 million doses EU, net benefit?

Other feel-good measure... plausible explanation EU seeking net gain, aka want import doses import. basically means: bullshit, can't benefit... demand benefit.

I understand logic two countries exporting/importing doses OTHER. Perhaps situation focused actually getting people vaccinated rather thinking lock forever. hurt, can't hurt others Done. generation largely vaccinated.

So get lives back now, yes? Coronavirus causing large green irradiated monsters now? Woah, heard one wallstreetbets second doses. bad manufacturers like ASTRAZENECA keep lowering delivery numbers last second.

also matter issues AZ generated delayed shipments again, end day still delivered efficacious life saving vaccine, others failed (e.g Merck, CSL, Sanofi) vaccine that's openly licensed production anywhere capability, (e.g Serum institute India) vaccine donated hundreds millions people across world- ones paying it, incredibly low cost.

 Punishing country fact company domiciled successfully produced vaccine outrageous call vaccine dud robust data based sample sets millions clearly disproves (and actually showed slightly stronger protection severe disease tier 1 vaccine presumably benchmark to) uncharitable american suffering brexit derangement syndrome quite rare days. Patents solely issued, enforced invented ""Government.""

Arguing patents valid discussion have. However saying ""Capitalism"" evil Government policy patent law kindof absurd. OK great, agree risk acceptable objective criteria applied government stops telling people gather together homes family? Also objective criteria government (state local otherwise) stop criminalizing wearing masks? 

I‚Äôve always believed trade personally feel emergency workers healthcare workers high risk individuals vaccinated time.

Yes, need fix underlying issues education system. meantime, kids falling even behind aren‚Äôt taking step could improve education right now: put back school. Beyond academic issues, help mental health social development.

Ultimately, there‚Äôs trade-off make. Yes, re-opening schools could lead infections, although school transmission relatively low. However, stands now, 20%+ US population vaccinated least one dose, vulnerable prioritized. Vaccinations continue rate two million doses per day. much longer justify price children paying?

Jeez NBC sort sorta dislike vaccines news source? currently extremely low precentage 80 vaccinated across Europe first misread ""vacations seem ease symptoms""...  Yeah, thousands dying becoming permanently maimed every day makes conspiracy theorist. Jesus Christ internet cesspool. flu deadly, we've gotten used killing tens thousands people per year.  allied nations? me-first export banners? allies are... possible calculated amount based 2019 return even already filed 2020. Could explain it?  I'm glad pessimistic outlook more. Pfizer didn‚Äôt take government money make vaccine want throw out. 

Does anyone think states already hitting vaccine uptake plateau. seems like Southern states expanding eligibility faster still lagging behind country. generally know political leaning older populations areas... apply US only? Brazil faaaaaaaar becoming endemic. :-( probably normal, it'll better (more open, less death, critically overwhelmed healthcare systems) point past year. still wear mask go grocery store, still feel comfortable sitting bar, I'll take it. reason politics stay fuck away science domestic point view, does. planned start UK designed sinister contracts, telling world great is. guarantee you: AZ supply (limited, one problems) smaller demand moment. ones refuse AZ, find others refuse it. Even among ones highest risk COVID death.  That's great keep wearing masks till every single person vaccinated. We're together! hindering exports countries? (relatively small) vaccine manufacturing capacity vaccines UK thrown domestic supply production licensed globally cost. never real expectation it'd used exports immediate term, make real difference EU given relative population sizes unless completely gave output EU reasons.

Maybe required AZ host manufacturing could play Billy Big Bollocks Vaccine Exporter win Internet brownie points something. Licensing produced everywhere cost certainly seem done us favours. one downvoting you, others probably implied claim massive. 

There potential contributing causes knowledge? randomly fell coma shortly getting vaccinated? wife got first covid shot 35 weeks (first day available state).... big question get 2nd one delivers!

Either way, Dr highly recommended get it. feel better knowing newborn already resistance Covid. 

As joke, told going sell milk black market.... would test kids expected unsafe? currently ranked 4th terms % vaccines distributed. Baker certainly deserve credit we've stumbles, think fair blame much either. good chance AZ approved USA within month so. Wait bit ask speak manager explain case can't wait. OK. Yea....I know that‚Äôs say. didn‚Äôt buy Brexit ref don‚Äôt buy now. UK tiny comparison strong, United EU. Maybe you‚Äôre conspiracy theorist grasping anything extend pandemic fear? THANK pointing out. EMA currently investigating it: [Official EMA simply changed current guidelines yet, issue statement findings Thursday. shitty president AZ effective Pfz? literally Deus Ex level plague ‚Äî rioting intensifying point may able contain it. contain it? Let spill schools churches. Let bodies pile streets. end, they'll beg us save them. I've received reports armed attacks shipments. There's enough vaccine go around, underclasses starting get desperate. **Page**: course they're desperate. smell deaths, sound they'll make rattling cages serve warning rest. Got it. agree. UK still receiving AstraZeneca vaccine doses produced EU? feel like issue late January, doses experts UK domestic production still ramping up.

Also, 'seize' factories. Soviet Union. German government paid develop RNA technology vaccine, US government made financially feasible promising buy billions dollars worth. Pfizer took 0 risk received public funds develop thing; ""right"" charge fortune people die.

edit: right, system works (and deserve downvotes saying it), system evil. BioNtech vaccine ready may 2020, that‚Äôs incredibly fast already. study also skewed towards younger people, measuring hospitalizations wouldn‚Äôt tell us much. Bingo. exact people downplayed virus, poo poo'd masks, acted like overall covidiots whole thing. want ""open now!!!!!"". ironically, good percentage problems due exactly shitty attitudes whole year. still gammons they're continent? like jambons think. businesses still require Dallas county traditionally great part masks distancing. Collin Tarrant heads sand since day 1. 'Tis small honest mistake

- AZ Well, double shot causes 97%+ effectiveness. shot effective gradually, without booster less effective. Yes, Pfizer‚Äôs covid vaccine German/USA partnership. manufacturing capacity support exports exist. AZ produced average less million doses week UK last four months - easily calculable long producing eleven million dose number quoted weekend - EU take? 

It never sized export facility never promised such. EU spent forever banging evils vaccine nationalism turned around started playing vaccine nationalist programme faltered due complete failure Sanofi (which somehow goes unremarked) AZ's production woes.

Of course Novavax vaccine change availability picture, that's due little yet think going play UK's vaccine programme time available. EU produces vaccines. Private companies vaccine manufacturing sites located sovereign countries part organisation called European Union.

The EU also bought vaccines private companies. What's alternative?

And please mention government planned economy history laugh examples. feel like shit day 2 yes (which means body mounting hell immune response). Stock Gatorade easy things eat like soup crackers. they? month ago read expecting $4 billion profit covid vaccines 2021.

Obviously, say 'free healthcare', mean free consumer point service. i.e.: UK, walk hospital, get treated, walk out, nobody ever mentions payment way... Absolutely agree. EU poor vaccine strategy worse execution. covering mistakes laying blame AZ (which fair, times, favours). fully agree here. UK though. Ursula planning make enemies now? got stay ahead curve republican govs reopening face spreading b117 p1 strains make easy... killing people seem like good political decision, again, Stalin Mao amazing careers despite snuffing half billion them. Holding Pfizer Moderna myself, mRNA extremely helpful combating variants. ""These six last weeks, 41 million doses exported [from EU] 33 countries.""

41 million doses?!?! bloody way sustainable. time we're saving elderly, sons-of-bitches continue stab EU relentlessly. Absolutely, look thousands available appointments way days. allocation supposed based percent used seems like ignoring that. Doubt it. 10 million significant amount. Love legal system designed fuck us instead situations like could regulate price vaccinations deadly disease tanked economy...... Finally EU grows spine. literally milked vaccines biggest vaccine exporters. US UK, hand, exported ZERO doses ANYONE. 

The EU considering extremely wise fair pragmatic option stopping exports ""vaccine-producing countries higher vaccination rates EU"". That's EU US. 

An export ban Pfizer vaccines UK, JnJ vaccines US. Perfectly reasonable.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* News AstraZeneca vaccine blood clots popular topic discussion area recently, despite exceedingly rare proven causational relationship time. peers pro-vaccine even brought concern. I'm worried huge problem, I'm worried similar reports isolated reactions fan flames conspiracy sow seeds doubt even typically level-headed individuals. 

Our rate vaccinations high, part wonders going begin flattening. easy vaccine people going way sign go get it, going much harder finding hold-outs, especially rural areas. Whether like not, herd immunity require vast majority people accepting vaccine, even fence. We're going need vaccinated achieve see happening anytime soon.


On happier note, I'm officially line state's vaccine registry currently awaiting email schedule first dose! never get 100% compliance vaccines nah, go through. One contradict Also, study came today AZ vaccine doesn‚Äôt fully protect African variant. 

It concerning sub burrying it, know Pfizer Moderna better (from study I've seen shown similar reaction SA original SARS, meaning strains behaves bit like novel virus).

We almost certainly need boosters SA variant anyway, better take vaccine take booster later SA strain. Netherlands think whole europe recommended wait pregnancy get vaccine, bc research effects child pregnancy. I'm surprised see lot comments considering completely normal mostly worried side effects vaccine self. Sinopharm sputnik v government run delivered year, idk vast majority tell happening. Sub reddits posts make r/all self selecting population. don‚Äôt disagree you. think pretty place dependent. Minnesota we're going surpass 80% uptake among 65+ (we're currently 76%), appointments still tricky come unless drive several hours away Twin Cities, providers using 92% vaccines receive within 3 days receiving like ton extras sitting around waiting administered. also PLENTY conservative older folks here.

All say, think we're anywhere close hitting plateau probably another months there's big surge supply. creating distributing successful mRNA vaccine 1 year failure sounds like care ideological battles actually helping people. find system without profits means let us know, you‚Äôd get Nobel Prize finding. ‚ÄúApes together, fucking stupid‚Äù Agreed currently laissez faire capitalism versus kind structural expectation honesty field journalism. Even slapping disclaimers program commercial break says ‚Äúthis program watching entertainment program meant replace verifiable news sources.‚Äù Would huge thing. watched 20/20 assumed mostly accurate it‚Äôs cable news, internet immediately apply large grain salt look multiple sources verify. act like old people take face value.  long? 3 weeks? 

This sub seemed large number posters thought Florida opening would reek havoc. everywhere else has, numbers reflect change whatsoever. peculiar. Almost like lockdowns actually effective all. would incredibly helpful October/November/December, much less useful testing demand cut least half places. least four places within three miles house get free rapid test now. I'm home testing, usefulness largely passed comes COVID. think underestimating much J&amp;J vaccine actually protect Covid symptoms transmission. pretend data same, still good rate protection. people high risk home, I'd recommend getting vaccines (unless they're 16, understandable) protect major illness. think main advantage taking vaccines decrease community spread. everyone gets whatever shot they're given, slight difference protection matter way less people transmitting virus anymore, achieved fast efficient vaccination. Waiting 'right' vaccine files face that. Well wonder AZ delivering then. would bother? Von der Leyen go fuck herself. already waste assloads money dumber shit. Fund winners losers. Epi pens costing $500 fucking stupid. Check counties. Many rural ones shots people wanting them. hard convince Americans take AZ news around clots. matter proven safe, public sentiment it. get AZ, makes sense send countries North South America. Usually they're brand new accounts well. Rich people end jail. seven Germany thirty elsewhere hospitalized thrombosis clots within two weeks astrazeneca vaccination. died.
Having trouble finding consistent number.
Most news says 'a low amount'.

Link German Health Agency insists rate higher amongst unvaccinated. Thrombosis Platlet loss listed vaccine safety documentation.

Bojo gonna take prove safe is. Despite already getting covid months ago. Sounds like PR solution actual problem.  What's Britbong? Thanks information, looks like EU purchased bit less thought (300 Million site instead 400 Million used mentioned various places) EU bit less 1 dose per head AZ vaccine would require proof... say many times like, make true.

Blame leaders. Might double check: never said that. clarified pointing flaws flawed system, despite option that's practice perfect Maybe privately research pharmaceuticals? Itd pretty poggers something nationalized. FUD one going want take second available vaccine planet.

Isn't AZ vaccine *the* available planet? SII pumping Nervous JJ vaccine, getting Saturday. Saw thread ton replies saying people felt death bed 24-36 hours getting shot. People down-voting thats free market works. losing money every $20 shot give out. get another billion aid US anyways laying groundwork additional lockdown ""urgining patience"" speeches Merkel nothing improve vaccination rates UK contractually obliged first x million vaccines produced UK going towards UK's vaccination effort.

Now again, I'm saying approach indefinsible actually think EU something similar, can't deny hindering exports countries.  Biden used DPA 4th july hotdogs selling pork china.

Also worked existing govt institutions instead firing people left right installing new cronies every weeks someone told truth like Redditors care mental health. pretend to, fa√ßade. fades away they're given opportunity live anti-social, shut-in lives ""heroes."" impossible relate mental health aspect socialization looking another person eye puts catatonic state. Absolutely yes best interest world vaccinate low middle income countries. Otherwise poorer countries become breeding grounds new variants could bypass vaccines. taxpayers funding winners losers? sounds inefficient like waste money. whole point privatizing convince private investors put money. data pretty clear - amount money consumers pay profits FAR less would paying government paying everything - losers winners. Especially invest profits go you. say cut middle man really mean making taxpayers pay ideological distaste profits (profits also go YOU) based economic evidence tells us best method fund research trials argument takes roughly three months surge show itself, Texas vaccinated well enough June? honestly believe gamble gov deciding take, (personally) think may pay off. clear, choice would've made, think pan ok. 

I think frustrating could used evidence masks overblown *whole time* reality probably helped good deal. may time vaccines coming swiftly enough (and seem effective enough) states may realistically begin open. masks worthless, may coming end surge, vaccines may cut new surge. 

But right, could jumping gun still possible surge brewing places we're catching yet. time tell.  Thats happens abysmal vaccination rate

since US making good work vaccines, return normal faster, European countries unfortunately continue nonsense. Notice ""bad"" news mostly focused Europe, suspension astraZeneca vaccine? well people strong overlap capital rioters. [**388 new cases** reported LA County county 11 million. positivity rate hovering 1.6 - 1.8%. 

Crazy think months said 3-4 million actually Covid county. think we‚Äôre kind going sort community immunity here. We‚Äôll see, opened indoor classes, it‚Äôs interesting see numbers look like weeks. 

Either way, I‚Äôm excited cautiously optimistic. See comment traumatized children forgetting mask. Also, mask wearing *awful* learning speech, basically single important task babies. That's fine. Ban shit it. Put tea. Redditors care mental health. pretend to, fa√ßade. fades away they're given opportunity live anti-social, shut-in lives ""heroes."" impossible relate mental health aspect socialization looking another person eye puts catatonic state. thing free healthcare. difference cost passed end recipient. Oh misunderstood, though saying ""from US"", well fairness BionTech German company get mean. EU 27 member states. get kids approved take Summer, absolutely reason full blown normalcy (packed stadiums &amp; music fests level normalcy) September. Pfizer looks effective AZ, especially south african variant. That's fine. want keep facilities running, that's UK. really think government run research programs would got done year? 

They would estimated 3 years start took 10. important thing still deaths,

It never me. Never probably lot people actually educated virus's risks. Deaths always low anyone already one foot grave, risks different. There's least 3 elite level UFC fighters whose careers might due complications Covid. exchange giving Serum Institute licence make it. 


In fairness amount going India UK total India's production tiny, India spent far doses vaccine diplomacy around world. pay attention votes sub anymore. various groups different views including anti-mitigation people people okay mitigation decided go full optimism point like downvote anyone undermines optimism way. Ftr, I'm favor returning pre-pandemic life soon conditions right, think progressive process months US longer outside US. Depends state website. tried NY couldn‚Äôt. Commission says working international bodies try agree common standards, mention US Commission working make sure certificates compatible systems third countries outside EU. proposal open global initiatives takes account ongoing efforts specialised agencies United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), establish specifications guidance using digital technologies documenting vaccination status. friend Shanghai also gets wake unbelievable air pollution every day. Yay. classic Reddit - America leading world vaccinations literally one pay it, still need shit capitalism.

Maybe move another country that‚Äôs capitalistic? Plenty choose from. Happy see happening, state really puts pressure every state 1) Announce future phases 2) Get open 16+ residents May 1.

For click article, 2 prior phases occur:

* March 22, individuals age 60 older, workers sectors transit, grocery, utility, food agriculture, sanitation, public works public health allowed book appointments. [Here full details industry workers qualify April 5, individuals age 55 older, one medical condition puts greater risk serious case COVID-19 become eligible. kids felt way first, really missing peer-peer socialization. isolation explains lot increases mental illness, self-harm, suicidal behavior.

You know stereotypes homeschooled kids? exist reason, homeschooled kids DON‚ÄôT meet way get plenty peer-peer socialization outside homeschool environment. Think sports, scouts, youth group, theater, neighborhood kids, etc. generation kids who‚Äôve homeschooled year without opportunities.

Plus there‚Äôs another big downside: online education quality worse many kids. know must do. really problem. Europe, get AZ even 70% refuse AZ, doses get used among 30% want them.

In country (Denmark) total amount AZ doses delivered far less get delivered Pfizer next week. Realistically, one gonna check health history see qualify. least NC matter checking box say yes, qualify group 1/2/3. sure sounds like chronic health issue. overthink it, get vaccinated can. Yep. I‚Äôm aware. see reinfection news, many cases people dying reinfection.

Once again, example exactly we've wanting see. vaccines job.

Also example terribly vital many care workers possible agree vaccination. chances bringing virus care home could significantly lowered, 48% staff vaccinated. plus, montanas life expectancy 78.8 years, putting #28. #1 hawaii 82.3 Many places allow schedule ahead. Really matter place try sign policies are, there's law state rule early scheduling. That's got mine last week. Ofcourse always fault people. Literally everything closed Germany since December. people 'idiots' cant stay inside watch netflix one year? way many tech illiterates. know couple 65+ refuse even try look online. called county health department waiting call back. meantime they‚Äôre complaining younger people ‚Äútaking shots away me‚Äù.

Because way voter base flip lol. Lord mercy Krogers employees get vaccine boomer home pajamas.

It worked end whatever. They‚Äôre already going make 3-4 billion year it.

Very broad generalization may fit case. Merkel also likes wait problems become large ignore. I'm jealous. moved Florida, part wishes I'd stayed. 

In early November closed restaurants, take only. supposed lockdown light month. mid December closed everything grocery stores, including hotels, museums barber shops/ services implemented curfew. states said travel 15km home. curfew struck court January. Schools closed December late February. retail opened last week, many limits. end sight rest. Well goes confidence graph then. anything, mental health situation alleviate over. current mass-anxiety surrounding disease combined isolation lockdowns causing problem. Illinois shit show, that's why. I'm western suburbs holding breath vaccine. God, YES, am! even know going suggested on! heard second shot seems magnify issues someone may experiencing time. someone bout arthritis might make much worst, migraine, might make way worst. info shows 2nd vaccine may actually causing types things worst, coincidental? appointments going waste though... Downvoted serious question.

Good job, Reddit. common vaccines known cause issues children occur adults? know mRNA new territory, wondering likelihood serious side effects are. Sorry man, EU really botching rollout. you‚Äôre US, UK, Israel though you‚Äôre gonna almost normal summer. Taxpayer funded daycare?

Not easy sell. Brazil maybe.
Bolsonaro no. sunlight kill coronavirus? mean body cloths. far know generally virus easily die without host sunlight, soap, alcohol,etc

I usually hang cloths sun returning office. capable killing virus ? Yea do. think many volunteer fire fighters? isn‚Äôt money pay them.

If want new drugs/medicine, need capital that. Shit doesn‚Äôt appear thin air. Definitions come real world, way around, US less capitalist markets completely free?

Also even so, there's multiple definitions.

Marxism-leninism foundation China's government, self described communist pursues interests proletariat. state controls financial sector thus plan economy, even existence highly regulated markets.

Maybe fit well idealized definition, people China rest global south give fuck whatever westerner thinks best way actually implement goals. Wait, game playing ? takes 2 months reasonably effective 85 percent still vaccinated. Many eldery still waiting. Thanks information source. get PNG Indian AZ jabs? UK needy right now? wait see. AZ doses already earmarked US. like AZ planning export customs official said no. EU leadership trying make look like care, cared would bid vaccine early instead waiting another surge throwing blame around. may help explain location, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York? people pushed ‚ÄúObey‚Äù narrative terminology months get talking points Tucker. Oddly enough people complain unemployment high people getting unemployment getting paid much sit home rake free money.

But obey thing alt right talking point. 

Just like masks submission government, winding slowly go away 2-3 months. never overbearing government control, mitigating world recognized global pandemic. know, many texans there

its group effort takes handful screw everything floating around long time.

Even seems super yet see need boosters. 

They're already worked quickly efficiently 


As opposed Measels. Correct I'm wrong, ever-changing strains Measels threaten continued efficacy MMR vaccine. czech republic  admin made huge effort get vaccine out...and deny simply rewrite history. Ridiculous really. wouldn‚Äôt vaccine waited Biden. MSM liberal politicians said didn‚Äôt necessarily want it. Remember Kamala said. made insanely Im using facts myself. EU brought spending much time negotiating process vs actually getting orders vaccines. Thats leadership. instance say hamburger joint buying burgers. line ahead you, decide fair wait, jump ahead rest despite already line paying it. Thats EU wants vaccines, last line, get last. Thats fair, EU get fair share turn comes up, despite leadership saying otherwise. Oh that's easy. Often engage conversation kind subject regret I'm tying mental threads bit squabbling mud corner internet that's isolated matter anybody change anybody's mind.

So kind comment make, realize added mental stack, delete. case minute so.

You've used comment necromancy retrieve reply (which I've always assumed possible), *also* made sure reply tie thread right back current awareness!

How wonderful! US signed export ban last minute December, right Europe already started vaccinations. lot corps deserve certain regulations penalties immoral things do

Did read entire response? posted article, even read it. said respect flow goods US different current setup U.S., von der Leyen noted. U.S., said, neither exporting importing finished U.S., **""there seamless flow back forth pre-products, raw materials drug substance,"" explained. ""So reciprocity given.""** Lisbon Treaty came effect 2010, transferred much power Commission without much oversight. got rid lot vetos replaced Qualified Majority Voting. problems occured post Lisbon Treaty (eurozone crisis, migrant crisis, Brexit, vaccine crisis).

The EU never go back was. (And old EEC perfectly functioning prosperous place). US 20 million AZ/Oxford vaccines sitting storage US allow exports vaccines yet approved US regulators.  think average american watches television news understand difference ""concern"" ""consequence""? realize drugs vaccines manufactured capitalism, right? Found source change facts laid Serbia. Serbia isn‚Äôt insane COVID surge right now. increase cases lower slower wave dealt fall/early winter outperforming less vaccinated neighboring countries. anything, Serbia living proof ability vaccines end pandemic Lmao gonna do? Stop ride? 63% 71% = 45% Germans would take AstraZeneca. Still good enough considering low deliveries... Yeah listen guy internet instead Right?? wouldnt able work job charge sick dying people extra money try gouge people. takes fucking psychopath go yeah get LITTLE little them....  Yeah think mandates much point, they're probably important. virus-avoidant behavior probably driven 

1) People waiting get vaccine own.

2) People waiting national mandates change

Mandates never effective they're unenforceable anyway. vaccinations rather moot point overall. J&amp;J production f'd; manage perceptions gone well perception problem US. AZ Novavax apply clearance soon US mRNA makers continuously scaling as, stated May, lack supply.

If there's story here, hard produce non-self replicating viruses. yes, get herd immunity? I'm sure shitty embargoes keeping stuck 50's tech standpoint America scared shitless communists nothing slower rollout. Yeah, except case bread. Maybe slice white bread slice rye. 

Honestly whole kerfuffle seems eerily familiar me. 

Probably 8 10 year old kids arguing exchanging m&amp;m's... gave 2 reds, owe two blues! 70% floating around long time.

We yet see need boosters. mRNA vaccine tech makes somewhat trivial compared new vaccine. Goodness we're quickly efficiently 

Where coming from? Who's saying this? Austria woman died waiting line vaccine. 

[The press loved Baker can't change vaccine supply feds. Currently people trying book appointments appointments available. take backs!? know Brits taking vicotry lap AstraZeneca breaking contract EU someone please explain like I'm 5 going Europe huge spikes again? lot more

Well UK, capacity export vaccines moment. used domestically - UKs vaccine production capacity great.

They better position EU lmao. EU definitely ban exports. get that, context scarcity... really make sense export 10 million+ vaccines first place NEED made whole. Isn‚Äôt overall goal herd immunity? Fair retaliation EU steals vaccines. I've actually able eat inside Denny's since April May. area done much worse many places extreme lockdowns. another reason I'm board opening sooner rather later.

If someone still waiting vaccine, person need do, everyone else. Like said, end sight, no? easy them. Nah I‚Äôm good. Already gym daily want fly US get COVID vaccine without me/my family needing self isolate two weeks. Surley parents, already vaccinated, would need quarantine well? save gaining couple millions Pfizer doses?


Pfizer currently two major supply chains, US one US domestic use (this one designed provide US, capacity produce anything beyond US order) European one global supply chain - block exports European chain, means one outside US EU receive Pfizer doses. Big world hit EU kinds sanctions. would declaration war. saw contract. 

Yes when? Right signing last summer?

AZ's contract EU names four sites: one Belgium, one Netherlands, two British plants. Read article clearly states money went UK. One would expect pay production (or tell else?), impaired UK deliveries increase capacity accordingly. AZ took 300million EU spent four sites, using one supply EU. Something's off, no?

And 8 million doses month would surely make dent EU supply, even 4 million would. Well, bit humorous exaggeration compounded first delivery going astray - contacted sent another box first one turned two weeks later said keep it, put us theoretically 6 months supply. delayed next shipment, turns actually don‚Äôt use much estimated delayed shipment arrived even started extra box! think head I‚Äôm still factoring teenagers whereas it‚Äôs us two. Thank you! even think fax! also find email thing annoying - even assistants help. Also, unfortunately, doctor across country, can't pick person (why switched years since moved, know...)  account older yours. must bot  Well process slowed down. complain. AZ using UK manufacturing plants send doses stated contract. People different perspectives ""fucking careful"" means. One interesting development seems like people long Covid improving vaccinated. Perhaps bodies need little help finish fighting initial infection. ÔøºThis extremely preliminary observation- actually know whether vaccination impacts long covid presentation- still potential light horizon! stated goals based doses manufactured shipped federal government, means there's leeway terms timing impact end goal administration. understand it, simplified:

1. Doses manufactured
2. Doses shipped manufacturers federal government **(this goals drug companies stated are)**
3. Doses received federal government
4. Doses allocated federal government states
5. Doses shipped federal government states providers
6. Doses received states providers
7. Doses administered

After step 2 takes time actually see doses flow system - maybe 2-3 weeks, think. AZ doses thrown away. put hold weeks most, deliveries still coming in. cleared roll excess doses tha built faster. change amount doses. linked CEO profile making billions dollars show capitalism pays SCIENTISTS...which topic sub-thread discussing. 

Go Glassdoor take look average scientist salaries Pfizer Biontech, compare comparable scientists working government labs making. Well, ever reason, long vaccines get there. Biden's response, think difference regards coordination working FEMA, military stuff. Yes, hear ya. EU sent UK 10 million+ vaccines. None gone way. logic is, AZ fulfills contract us; not, stop 10 million exports you‚Äôre getting keep us whole (or closer it). they'd pull vaccine third world would completely screwed mutations could develop freely. thing doom gloom crown. 

Can't take seriously anymore, sorry. months ago think thing fucking black death reading sub. Meanwhile people like rightly pointing lockdowns failed served ruin millions lives, yea, *we're* conspiracy theorists. Spot on. could say country banning exports used vaccines produced domestically contracted used countries? Ridiculous argument. embarrassing, yes, looks like fucked pretty early today, huh?

I did, fact, think Bosnia, Serbia Heregovia one political unit, Bosnia Serbia entirely different vaccination strategies.

So--whoops. 

Doesn't change fact laid Serbia effort, merely I've made real ugly american so, I'll flog looking Atlas later. *AZ delivering. bread, cheese. give half enjoy nice cheese sandwich. brand medication used U.K. causes serious interaction vaccine (the contraceptive pill?)

Stick : Half vaccines far Pfizer, vast majority early ones, going start second doses coming weeks link CEO profile making billions dollars show capitalism pays workers? once, I'm glad America. crazy ass problems, COVID related otherwise, never expected Europe fuck bad. actually proves point. people careless, makes sense take vaccine 20% effective (not percentage points) smart whole time could end catching Covid careless person inferior vaccine. Since know getting Covid, even asymptomatically, organ damage possible lifetime disabilities, smart get good vaccine. No. must find plateau far away random county variant known dangerous concerned despite every indicator going right direction. 

Take masks says. don‚Äôt drive house fat 61 year old aunt travel 2 miles hasn‚Äôt looked hard vaccine appointments she‚Äôs worried Bill Gates, shoot face. Point think would considered ""exporting"" US law. I'd see concrete source this. seems like nobody knows certain. Seems like Biden needs clarify. Lockdowns 2020 solution. They‚Äôre effective right they‚Äôre implemented first time become less less effective time goes people tire them.

Denying social creatures lives year going work. point, vaccine luxury. Almost need it/are getting anyone else extra fuck welll doesn‚Äôt sound like coronavirus anymore

instead political Definitely right decision. US UK benefit EU EU citizens.

The EU focus others. people waiting travel non-vacation reasons, it‚Äôs huge deal regardless open place is. don‚Äôt care there‚Äôs anything except go grocery store watch Netflix, want country boyfriend start getting things worked keep way. considered proof vaccination, purpose international travel? standard set yet? Pfizer's vaccine developed BioNTech, took several hundred million Euro. importantly, Pfizer received orders tune couple hundred million doses USG. almost like orders came single payer something. general rule reddit- assume one comment section actually read beyond first paragraph unless comments. 

That goes time tho. skim recommendations, read edit. fact common flu hardly detected year suggests study inaccurate well distancing effective.

The recommendations say evidence, also quality data. That's far definite. really depends important person shot better. J&amp;J may well best option people transient otherwise unable return booster, afraid needles can‚Äôt handle 2 shots, feel security J&amp;J others, extremely concerned side effects, etc. mRNA vaccines typically better people concerned stopping spread symptomatic covid return booster. Eventually J&amp;J likely offered vaccine + booster format well, leveling playing field. Meanwhile New Mexico still 75+ right + medical conditions? Haha. us obedient you.

""Thank sir may another (lockdown!)"" US least, adults vaccinated, EVERY adult would vaccinated reach herd immunity. Europe going far behind vaccines compared 1st world countries.  source that? Iowa's Governor announced expect open eligibility Iowans April 5th. Serbia‚Äôs seven day average currently 3k less early fall/late winter surge. trajectory current surge 20-25 percent less early fall/late winter surge. course! business, yearly booster shots bonanza! Hard fail even lockdown LOL. anyways nice day, clear live different realities pointless arguing you. VASTLY different EU earmarked doses simply bottled US far know would constitute ""export"". Biden needs clarify reassure EU J&amp;J doses.

Just learned JnJ moved bottling step Germany precisely fear US keeping doses. dramatic, like temporarily delayed.

Spoken like textbook, out-of-touch Reddit armchair evangelist. Well, fact vaccines less popular sort make argument. reluctance get vaccinated (including waiting specific shot) increases risk everyone. Although say flying around United States later year would doubt high risk, considering transmission rates going rate we're vaccinating everyone, even 'low-vaccination' areas.  fair, Brazil isn‚Äôt much keep claiming this, although others pointed out, case. free flow resources countries, US vaccines made Baltimore. 

The EU actually one needed J&amp;J plants US bottle vaccines due bottlenecks. 

Stop spreading lies throughout entire post. called many times. somewhat possible friend contracted COVID second shot, shot itself, two shot vaccines MRna, actual carry part virus. 

His ""symptoms"" reactions shot, nothing contagious from. can't spread symptoms vaccine another person. 2 weeks flatten curve? I‚Äôm saddened people actually believed trump said magically going go away. Possibly. hello Janssen. time believe might even options available. That's children 6 months 11 years. know trials older children? Sir reddit. Europe perfect every way. America evil country world history Yup. tell thread, lot people profoundly stupid. Like, earth shattering levels dumb goal post moved people actually listened experts made slight effort. everyone wore masks social distanced, could best earlier. Instead rely vaccine. site? That's definitely case search appointments. Lol.

Except promised manufacturing fully sorted 100 million doses ready go end 2020, even boasted businessman like would supply ready go.

But vaccine manufacturing never ramped way promised. turned couldn‚Äôt get materials needed quantity needed without DPA, Trump refused help vaccines made would go overseas.

Again, production supposed ramped months EUA, didn‚Äôt happen instead 100,000,000 vaccines delivered Dec 31st took months do.

Why hard you. public health crisis like this, government would fund medical research. government run medical systems world, like medical research. they're working boosters, mean they're necessary, Moderna really clear that.

Even slight decrease efficacy enough cause concern boosters worked right now, scientists anticipate us needing them. needing right now, preparing mutations see future. barely qualifies lockdown churches still opened people gather large groups work.

Also, supposed end 9th April. day Kaczy≈Ñski course organize another one ridiculous monthiversaries Smole≈Ñsk catastrophe. suggesting stop updating plan based changing circumstances? 

I hope charge anything important personal life. guess don‚Äôt want visitors Vaccine producers Canada able maintain financial viability due government intervention market. work them?

The value faster vaccines would literally trillions dollars. incredibly short sighted try penny pinch area. need remain masked another 5 billion years sun's growth destroys life earth (including covid)!!!!!!! hard understand. view NPIs impractical and/or ineffective mitigating pandemic.

That's broadly consistent failures COVID lockdowns produce better outcomes places opted implement them.

Rest ducking weaving generally going way avoid acknowledging simple point. Exactly this. may one point, according link, he's CEO now.

CEOs spend time lab. US 20 million AZ/Oxford vaccines sitting storage US allow exports vaccines yet approved US regulators.

So? already announced expecting approval come within 30 days stockpiling doses meet contractual obligations US taxpayers. Yes, play game.

That point. important ask political questions people refusing vaccine. political reasons group getting vaccinated, important page Lol.Live Maumee drive hour get it. That's due federal medical privacy law, nothing California. can't require disclosure. US relying domestic production plants EU JnJ vaccine supplies. Many eldery still waiting.

And understand this. longer feel need shut society protect small minority people. Let's keep people safely homes, everyone else. live Los Angeles. true lockdown multiple pockets year extended periods time. opened indoor dining first time since summer. Playgrounds even shut period December. museums open, libraries, movie theaters. So, yeah, places locked 365 days. means china's economy well right now, specifically locked early on. want economy back not? looks like ""not"" answer. Ps: name place better china lock down. disputing fact Uƒüur ≈ûahin wife scientists? Ok, define ""fair share"". Right AZ behind UK deliveries EU proportion due delivered far (Including 10 million coming India 25% UKs order filled compared 30-40% EUs).

A valid version fair share would include EU allowing delivery AZ vaccines UK make shortfall proportion order Spoiler: received regulations penalties note pushing opiate epidemic.

They've literally pushed highly additive drug, killing thousands crippling many that, purely profit single person seen prison cell fine big enough serve anything cost business.

They fucking owe us. mention wake minute class starts

I'm student I'm mom gonna hard give up. can't believe used get 2 hours earlier bunch stuff drive school time wake  Every reasonable person back already knew going 1-2 year event ( ended early due multiple successful vaccines). didn‚Äôt either naive dumb.  can't even get 100% cooperation American citizens regards ""Thou shalt kill other, else one shall spend rest life behind bars.""

Given that, absurd think get 100% cooperation regards ""thou shalt get vaccinated, else government jack around restaurant owners."" perhaps stop moving goal posts. company wanted doses exported EU US blocked effort. kind earmarking talking about. AZ vaccine even approved US yet lmao UK received smaller percentage AZ vaccines ordered EU has. ""destroying future young people"". dramatic, like temporarily delayed.  

I prefer young people waiting launch corpses, maybe I'm minority.  case busy fighting invisible enemy think im toying ( wtf wrong you)

You answered question, know herd immunity safe way get it.

It doesnt matter little bubble gets good chunk state hesitant to. hospital admissions ventilator numbers steadily declining, glad see pressure NHS slowly eased. want open economy? going deal lockdowns. 

What fuck even mean?

Plenty places lock worse places did. That's reality; deal it. don't. stop trying force delusions onto others. waiting increases time exposed people careless. people wait, longer we're community transmission limbo. perfectly understandable think ones love, experience sort eliminated bigger picture. faster everyone's vaccinated matter vaccine, faster one worry included. herd immunity provided vast majority adults vaccinated probably fine, vaccinating children certainly harm. Delaware mistake reporting? can't find source shows 39%.  AZ doses sit US doses US contracted, purchased received US Government warehouses AZ. ""Exporting"" would constitute exporting US purchased &amp; owned doses US stockpile. 

That VASTLY different EU earmarked doses simply bottled US far know would constitute ""export"". Biden needs clarify reassure EU J&amp;J doses. rogue commas throwing off, thanks report. whole thing *terrifying*. Thank god Europe really expierence weather extremes like US think guys would make Hurricane Katrina; EU would crumble fall apart. started teaching children stick things outlets. dunno, seems kind obvious follow CDC guidelines since experts, apparently simple things like wearing mask huge problem morons. everyone worried it. Many vaccines approved certain age ranges health conditions. People anti-vax making choices people can't vaccinate. Stop nonsense harm done.

That seems like fairly dumb threat make given that, others pointed out, US importing vaccines EU. 

So threat going accomplish? terrible idea. already way little investment vaccine research production large societal benefits were. need incentives aligned ensure sufficient research investment takes place next time. Booked JJ next week! excited :D

My biggest fear long haul symptoms vaccine kill fear getting chronic stuff covid! explain JnJ would produced, pleasently surprised with... Definitions come real world, way around, 

The definition Communism comes Marx Engels. Modern china nothing common Marxism-leninism foundation China's government, self described communist pursues interests proletariat. 

Wait, wait.  form goverment specifically built grant power working class remove capitalist ideals country utilizing slave labor bolster capitalist society doing?  Fucking Maybe fit well idealized definition,

That's say Jeff Bezos profited pandemic, definitely has. online shopping boom benefit long COVID gone. cherry-pick crap.  Scream inside heart! Thanks Yep. that‚Äôs going stop. Can‚Äôt change past avoid future. 

It‚Äôs big mess hopefully vaccines come line pressure AZ reduce. Pic something whine about. economy want whine about? Lockdowns? freedom. can't once. want open economy? going deal lockdowns. Welcome reality. Please show I'm missing. quality evidence restriction lockdown based low non existent recommendations conditional that.

But Serbia jut time worst numbers new restrictions speedy vaccination campaign. new production line supposed operational fourth quarter. I'm sure addresses current concerns J&amp;J ability meet commitments. EU exactly making optimal use AZ vaccine it? Even stopped using it. UK one west making good use them, yet UK mainly shitting demanding AZ supplies from. 
 
She said US situation mostly ok ""they're exporting importing either"". I'm engage childish toxic behavior democrats partake in.  US would keep doses? another redditor explained, Biden's invoking Defense production act forbids vaccines exported. doses would kept US. done thing AZ. company wanted export number doses US EU, US administration blocked export.

Well 142M distributed, Pfizer (120M), Moderna (100M) JNJ (20M) said would 240M. Let's say takes week distribute states, averaging 3M day. means buffer 20M so. Let's say 165M rolled feds hands. 15 days left march, 240M-165M=75M, would 5M per day. would listen vaccine experts, medical training say much.

In view, proven getting vaccine perfectly fine getting covid deadly family, choose vaccine. Maybe clear..  mean actual sequence produced virus, laboratory stuff. ??Maybe better term mean.

Can‚Äôt wait see y‚Äôall there! know 3 now?

It's gotta way we're 143 million distributed total.

Seems like we'd need average something like 10 million day rest month numbers. immunity gradient rather threshold. Also, likely many people infected natural resistance mentioned. say 8 cases every 1 confirmed.  crazy countries well early public health response completely botched vaccine rollouts, whereas US UK, neither covered glory initially, done well vaccine front. already came hometown turned 350,000 sq ft convention center mega vaccine center runs like well oiled machine. looking forward going back dose too, smooth pleasant honestly. articles designed piss off.

Yeah, [already pharmacist sabotaged batch vaccines letting thaw overnight. tampered introduce poison anything, clearly crazies might something like this. Capitalism saves billions innovations made elimination starvation poverty real possibility. powerful black people world America, pushing anti-racist agendas capitalist means. 1 year developed distributed vaccine thank capitalism for. 

It sounds like you‚Äôre really progressive. want world innovations end poverty. want world poverty exists ever nourished governments tit. want world innovations give us rapid medical treatments. want world innovation stagnates everyone access medical advancements 80s... 

You talk expanding funding ICUs ignore fact US already highest per capita rate ICUs world. wonder why? Almost capitalist system incentivizes building infrastructure... huh weird, Europe trying restrictive last year even though we're along, data vaccines. Last summer July September Europe pretty much open inside Europe. needed masks indoors. year, good luck. I'm Germany we're 3.5 months lockdown end sight. Canada. 12-16 weeks apart starting everybody get vaccinated June 20 starting second dosis first ones. posted wrong link buddy. Check next time. took supplement page. 

Again, extrapolating data cohorts whole UK. see, proportions seen Oxford group different Scottish paper (from 25% 5%) 

Therefore one cannot conclude HCW UK received Pfizer. say speculation, useless nationwide data. mechanism vaccine clear long-covid symptoms. 

I think 4 5 mechanisms vaccine could clear long COVID symptoms. Probably best one would wild type SARS-CoV-2 infection induces rapid IgG antibodies shorter amount time we'd see respiratory viral infections. B cells producing IgG antibodies derived extrafollicularly undergone selection self. vaccine induces germinal centers would allow B cells undergo selection self, thereby clearing cross-reactive antibodies. Re-entry B cells germinal centers shown antigen-driven selection vaccine certainly would induce non-inflammatory environment like see wild type infection. best article I've read, put mildly. flu kills tens thousands that's vaccine. exactly threshold?

Yeah 50,000 people fine 100,000 much!  Option 1: suspend cause damage confidence AZ now.

Option 2: Continue, ignore potential health risk. issue, contamination, ignored it, create far vaccine skepticism Option 1. safe, possibility ignored potential health risk still hurt confidence AZ, also affect trust regulators.

It's shame AZ keeps issues would happily take tomorrow could. far I'm concerned, suspending mitigates damage. LA County reported 318 cases today, lowest number since April 13! Ngl, pretty disappointed. hell supposed reach end March end April targets? I'm seeing it.... threatening put pineapple pizza strike back Dude even know start.

Trying weed ""tourists"" would probably counter productive though would take effort worth. way someone come US get two doses vaccine without spending least several hundred thousands dollars US businesses sales taxes... either way would helping pay. would make think variants fall ‚Äúvariant high consequence‚Äù

The headline literally says ""variants concern."" interpretation beyond reader. 

Without different enough vaccines stop working, we've already seen strains different enough create new problems. UK brutal lockdown get R0&lt;1 increased contagiousness strain, something like coming California right herd immunity months away would really unfortunate.

Texas blew doors wide open, one state detected new strain... think concern warranted. Correct punctuation important.... ""What? humanitarian?!"" Source? good something, never free. .. really?

""No link variant deaths"" nice r/assholedesign right sure I'm suppose focus best times, since silver lining here, appreciate taking time try relax me, really to. measure outcomes - people vaccinated Pfizer 80% less likely subsequently test positive COVID expect say 80% effective reducing symptomatic infection - hospitalisations etc. UK broadly similar outcomes found Pfizer Oxford. UK US give vaccine countries.. remember : UK US powerful country , countries created , produced distributed vaccine like Moderna, AstraZeneca, Pfizer Johnson&amp;Johnson chances dying age range cerebral hemorrhage/Brain trombose general population? significantly higher 3 died post-vaccination?

Unfortunately, lot Americans use term 'critical thinking' without understanding - critical thinking asking questions 'doing research', able evaluate sources information arguments objective critical way, well aware biases.

In case example critical thinking would starting question: lifting mandate likely lead higher levels infections hospitalizations? Then, finding evidence support argument, and- critically- evaluating evidence! source information reliable? bias influencing evidence?

What many people start opinion feeling, trying hard find anything supports feel, missing important step- evaluation. Research focused finding answer independently feel.

Let's look data fall new cases US slowing recent weeks, clear.
It also clear [B117 SARS-COV-2 transmissible previous variants, cause surge new COVID-19 cases across Eastern Central Europe. almost certainty B117 become dominant variant across US coming weeks. 

Relaxing indoor restrictions drives R virus becomes likely spread one person another, thus also (reduces impact previous lockdowns long 
Thus, unlikely new daily cases start growing US near future.

It also noted lot disagreements current (COVID-19 (on whether new cases start result factors - possible prior immunity combined rapid rollout vaccines enough prevent surge cases near future. http://imgur.com/iAFxNh5

All Im looking good reason go. people said go, dont comment risk factor. said low risk, havent said why. tell low risk, tell low risk, make informed decision. want go. EU busy suspending vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

 get wrong, get jab whenever possible, but:  696.679 people age group Denmark. 6 people died. 0,00086%  6 comorbidities. remember one remaining 3 news died, obese. last 2 know anything about.  stats understand people would hesitant get jab, especially nurses died blood clots healthy. absurd question actually. risk, information big wildly incoherent fuckton people know nothing hygiene sprout laize-faire nonsense people needing masks distancing ""Cause risk small"" guess what, distancing wearing mask drives risk first place. absolutely sensible ask people's opinions risks, since obviously still tons people spreading shit around cause consider risks correctly. Sorry that's meant cases complications pregnant women vaccinated? We‚Äôre child next weeks battling back forth getting much EU spend? 20 000 euros plus 10% coupons ? sure did, many see situation. 'They knew getting into', 'It's part job'. 'If can't handle healthcare'.
Many people simply ignorant callous opinion sacrifice part healthcare workers past year. lack equipment support levels personal risk illness, disability death apparently expected parts job. can't deal it, somehow deficient belong healthcare. Toughen up, buttercup. Actually, laborers scientists created vaccine. capitalism little it. always scientists making cutting edge technology regardless capitalism. Why? that's fine normal times. Sadly normal times yet.

If read, answer. I'll stress again, EU federal gov like US Russia, powers impose export ban contracts signed investigate fraudulent supplier. I‚Äôve found information certificates travel among E.U. states.... waiting update vaccinated non-EU members specifically US. Celebrating Saint Patrick‚Äôs Day fully vaccinated today Corona green food coloring. Cheers end mess! what? don‚Äôt scale production distribution. income well presume. mean and? UK vaccinated people whole EU together UK using Biontech yet, would empty threat. Maybe might look good European press? UK exported every single dose produced, around 13 million, EU's situation would different today. UK's capacity enough make difference. Stop blaming UK woes. think Moderna already expensive Pfizer. $25 vs $20 so

US government got first 100m moderna dose $15 $1 billion us funding) That'd still delaying vaccination weeks. Also 250 million doses 125 million people 500 million overall, enough herd immunity. move would basically hamper UK EU vaccination programmes nice touch causing major confrontation UK government EU. warned bloc ‚Äúwill reflect whether exports countries higher vaccination rates us still proportionate‚Äù.

This good argument. EU block exports vaccines producers target convince manufacturers deliver minimum obliged doses countries outside EU. nice, crackpot theory.
So read one story US trying pressure Brazil buying Sputnik squeeze conspiracy theory EU US control, despite showing evidence EU countries breaking ranks going way EU made pigs arse vaccine plans.
Keep taking meds friend, sounds like need them. American pharmaceuticals making billions selling vaccines, know desperate American governments fill pockets ""lobbyists"" (bribers). *would* allow non-profit vaccine?  
 
Essentially, USA USA. surprised? Flu shot timing pregnancy. early pregnancy fall, get then. Tdap usually given 28 weeks. Anyone living frequently caring baby get too! Pertussis easily hospitalize (or worse) newborn! works ways needless sabre rattling end backfiring EU hurt UK. 

So supplies Moderna Switzerland? Well EU powerless stop supply, Novavax supply UK online approved shot foot again, UK chooses reciprocate. That's concerning bit. Although UK, Canada Australia using AZ hopefully enough show people still much safe abd effective Nice try, summer going normal wether like not. 

The variants narrative last gasp dying legacy media attempting squeeze one last drop covid profits. Ah yeah, clarify - average person's fault imo, feet politicians absolutely botching public messaging. Go Vac Go! No, all. arm hurts vaccine one two reasons part. Reason 1. body responds stabbed needle. response punctured, body increases blood flow area facilitate healing. Increased blood flow creates increase pressure puts strain nerve endings. Strained nerve endings send pain signals. common reason pain injection.

Reason 2. skin allergic reaction vaccine injection site. body might thrilled foreign agent interacted skin create small allergic response kind. fairly uncommon though. 

So shoulder hurt? possible person gave injection skilled person gave friend caused less trauma area. may also relaxed friend caused needle less damage. friend may also sensitive injury response system do. 

In short, good. ""variants"" stuff nothing special, again, every virus mutates, COVID exception that. Virus gonna virus.

 media reported flu's mutations much covid's, flu also make situation ""seem"" hopeless, don't, alas seem like much problem. even COVID continues mutating, we'll continue producing vaccines it, like continue flu despite mutating.

Normal close, panic. think reflects Europeans feel. Oxford probably know university Europe AstraZeneca partially Swedish company it‚Äôs certainly nationalistic thing opinion. vaccine cleared EMA national institute health I‚Äôm standing arms ready! wrong. EU say countries choose do. There's plenty countries continuing vaccinations AZ. indepent regulator EU (the EMA) also stated vaccinations continue.

Pfizer/BioNTech managed fix production issues deliver schedule. now, AZ consistently fail promises. also asked approval Dutch plant, make least delays. Looks like can't bothered.  Tbf EU EMA repeatedly stressed safe EU countries continued it. number EU countries unfortunately stopped understand frustration kinda off-topic IMO - national regulators' decisions (overriding EMA), EU Commission President's statement (now) limited AZ Pull plug take court recover losses. waste time agree everything said, see relation comment.

The comment said travel restrictions planned based vaccine traveler received, pointed EU announced discriminate people received vaccines without EMA's approval (currently includes Sputnik V Sinovac, even though people get antibodies them). What's next, people service animals? Russia white country Biontech likely answer.

The EU export anything new Marburg plant, paid German EU tax payer money completely independent Pifzer need raw materials. vaccine complete trials administer it.

It minimum link people taking vaccine subsequently contracting blood clots.

There isn't. reason think vaccines cause blood clots. That's almost literal quote EMA official. took year figure virus Scientific Community"" except quick Google search shows dozens health agencies questioning a) efficacy b) possible side effects

No one questioing it. honesty blame average Italian French person refusing AZ. mean know safe know I'd happily take offered tomorrow. average person maybe kept much safety data etc see government first approve 65s say approved ages soon suspend abd resume it. let's forget Macrons comment quasi ineffective care anyone says sort comments would expecr anti vaxxers. Yh that's going reduce confidence vaccine. need alot messaging matter. According Q-brother, vaccine makes sterile/barren. nobody's going kids anyway. concentrate getting vaccines summer?  I've claiming since way J &amp; J data released common sense. cares cases result deaths? Long term effects, sure, whatever, really pales comparison actually dying. Austria.Lockdowns ever since November free time.People don‚Äôt really care lockdowns anymore obviously working I'd rather export bans get life back.  surprised Pfizer misses 10 million. J &amp; J real letdown, suspect reason Biden camp swung action get Merck help produce inside knowledge J &amp; J going take *lot* longer ramp initially thought.

However, it'll bit pays dividends like flip switch Merck pump J &amp; J vaccines overnight. think climate plays big role:

Warmer weather means people tend socialize outdoors.
More sunshine means higher vitamin levels faster natural surface disinfection.
Aerosols stay airborne longer dry environment/low humidity. Florida humid. Maybe listen Bolsonaro case. 
You ready give virus 99% survival rate? silly? happened generation? Good times create weak men. Vitamin weather. Ohio days everyone 16+ eligible starting March 29th. Uh huh. 100% effective hospitalization death yet 67% effective severe covid (includes resulting hospitalization &amp;/or death) JJ‚Äôs funny number public relations campaign continues. Sorry add company‚Äôs legal history &amp; one‚Äôs me. Occam's Razor guess would ""they much plate already"" Literally talking about. Report variants important, joe shmoe doesn‚Äôt need articles every variant thousands. It‚Äôs clicks know that. Killing grandma social deprivation isolation save grandma. sure voting bit ridiculous. stated fact trying stir shit up. took vaccine went coma wtf US made decision Astrazeneca vaccine Astrazeneca yet applied approval. reportedly day now. I‚Äôm boat concern [temporary] side effects second vaccine. People reported fever persisting 1-3 days detrimental fetus. would want get vaccine could guarantee fever would cause problems baby, though. wish. least would mean everyone wants could get vaccine.

The problem is, nearly enough vaccin doses. EU, countries world.

Other countries like US UK made better job securing big part limited production.

The real losers poor countries. world fight every vaccine dose next year even years. Considering showed 10% efficacy SA variant might prudent decision anyway. Blocking bogus clotting claims though. I'm sorry wrong. First US exporting Moderna doses finished. UK doses presumably come Switzerland (which finished filled Spain believe still EU).

Also think UK suffer cut Pfizer? Pfizer makes half supply atm huge part UK vaccination plan. UK definitely want happen would much worse did. damned do, damned situation. Lockdown horrible, went business usual hospitals collapse due extreme hospitalizations would see people self lockdown, panic, storm stores supplies, would cause social unrest. collapse hospital system creates domino effect would cause system wide collapse people panic go self preservation mode. People would stop going jobs, supplie chains would fail, food would hoarded fought over.

People realize close could come massive societal collapse, far fragile would expect, look people hoarded paper towels... hospital system fails thats match lights real fire, entire purpose flattening curve, flatten enough prevent massive failure. Would end world? Certainly not. Would nightmare 100 times worse effect economy lives? Absolutely Unless blood clot fears proven true Norway gets absolutely nothing cutting AZ.

And two weeks lockdown nothing. EU starts seizing nations vaccines private companies breach contracts signed, long nations stop exporting components needed make vaccines EU?

Then everyone screwed. Bravo Ursula. someone lives EU,good luck that.People dont give fuck anymore,me included.These incapable leaders live lives million dollars mansions go whatever locking us down. That's also AZ asked approval. seems AZ can't bothered EU proactive all. described blood clot related events 

Nothing dishonest. MHRA EMA endorsed vaccine following investigation ban continuing

Surely companies making billions vaccine would reason want discredit profit vaccine maybe that's paying attention

28 events 26 million doses. constitute rare symptoms? Suspending vaccine done harm good country really hasn‚Äôt lockdowned since last May don‚Äôt even know bring up.

I think using technical definition lockdown. live NYC, last year *brutal* extrovert like myself. cases 700 per day (out 8,000,000) still couldn‚Äôt outdoor dining, every indoor form entertainment closed. Indoor dining paused fall recently, outdoor dining it‚Äôs 23 degrees outside sucks matter many heaters have. 

Museums limited capacity. Everywhere go city constantly reminded virus. 

My point complain this, it‚Äôs dispel notion ‚Äúlife hasn‚Äôt changed‚Äù result virus. Life sucked last year living here, despite fact it‚Äôs technical lockdown guards monitoring movement throughout street. It‚Äôs literally one week. 7 days. opened last May took til July surge show itself. announced limited openings starting mid May put mask mandate place July 2. Warm weather help. However, vaccines help. Funny many can‚Äôt believe science behind Covid totally depend science behind vaccines. certainly hope vaccines work well hope. First, sure looking AGI (line 8b 2019 1040 line 11 2020 1040)? Second, filed 2020 taxes yet? so, $78k 2019 2020 AGI? admit parts regarding spreads well understood. Fl California similar deaths per capita. Florida older population well California one youngest. can't sit call numbers sample sizes big ""luck"" don‚Äôt think scrap it, accept deliveries give people 2nd dose. planned deliveries Norway anyway less 10% total vaccines. unmasked rallies EU anything differently UK protected bought share. ""The Scientific Community"" except quick Google search shows dozens health agencies questioning a) efficacy b) possible side effects. people infact scientists.

Not every regulatory agency saying all, full stop. took year figure virus airborne.

There minimum link people taking vaccine subsequently contracting blood clots. Whether like not, different explanation really leaning towards think magic.

Maybe vaccine complete trials administer it. Absolutely, hopefully approved children ASAP U.K supplies components Pfizer vaccine would imagine U.K would respond export block said components long vaccination rate continues, much problem long run. AZ vaccine back use already. investigate *cluster* blood clotting irregularities, statistically significant enough investigate fact happened cluster. guys get Trumpian day. AZ yet applied authorization Dutch plant.

As why, anyone's guess. suspicions. right signs Europe learned awful issues variant caused UK. Instead, seems like countries even relaxed lockdown rules surprised variant exploding control.  
 
At least Europe chance vaccinate *some* population variant hit badly, guess. Yes. Also humidity. Aerosol droplets stay airborne longer low humidity. USA using them? Great news, hopefully removes vaccine skepticism ENA removed authorisation AZ highly unlikely so. ENA repeatedly stressed vaccine safe benefits outweigh risks. EU countries even stopped think Belgium example still using it. think EMA due give report tomorrow established vaccine still safe EU countries suspended resume using it. answer, best answer have. Feeling despair last months. Cases rising US, French California variants now? don‚Äôt think US normal summer point. Maybe save headlines confirmed vaccine evaders?

Give 65+ vaccinated ability schedule week out. Give 55+ ability schedule 5 days out. Give 45+ high risk conditions ability schedule 3 days out. there's still appointments available 1-2 days out? Let whoever sign first take it. 

It helps prioritize need still making sure available doses distributed. 

(Maybe California - know sure state isn't). covid huge concern young healthy

Unclutch pearls hysterical bullshit. people dramatic lol need government tell do. go unless to.

The decision somewhat controversial. regulatory authorities took view manufacturers tested 3 week intervals, therefore dose 3 week intervals. far tell, JCVI relied experience vaccines immunology generally judge efficacy probably would diminish rapidly 3 weeks. seems correct call, layman way knowing whether luck involved.

Of course, beginning year UK desperate situation. new B1.1.7 variant spreading rapidly hospitals danger overwhelmed. imagine JCVI might made decision situation bad. still, incredibly gutsy call. probably win European championships year, good beer chocolate.

It's worth pointing PCR target failure uncommon. UK, PCR testing used multiplex test tests 3 separate genes: S, N, ORF1ab.

The ""UK variant"" notable, main gene mutation primer site used PCR. result, variant could reliably detected without need sequence PCR result showing N ORF1ab Positive, negative. UK variant approximately 100% circulating CV19 UK.

A separate sub-lineage variant also acquired mutations ORF1ab gene, leading gene target failure. result, approximately 50% CV19 case currently detected UK test N positive, ORF1ab negative.  Thanks look it. inferred basing opinions one location, I‚Äôve proven untrue. Keep trying, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll fail acknowledge mistake continue argue meaninglessly. unfortunately since case deaths rise, get worse gets better. AZ vaccine already go testing phase successfully, personally increasingly leaning towards believing there's sort intent lobbying behind this. hate sounding like conspiracy theorist, goes.

Take Norway then, could politician possibly gain creating shitstorm surrounding potential side-effects? young healthcare workers start dropping one week vaccination medical experts raise flags, need act least safety-first principle. 

I also find funny conspiracies are, surprise surprise, primarily something read Reddit. think I've even seen single news outlet Norway much suggest political points gained here. I'm getting aneurysm reading comment fields. Reposting yesterday new dose allotment totals

So looks like Moderna hit 100 million goal end March (which April 4 allotment).

Pfizer pace 105 million, short 120 million said (but believe original est 100m). would need increase output 15 million next 2 weeks. sure expecting going off.

J&amp;J looking great. said 20m end March - 3.7 million weeks allotment ~400k (same last weeks). pace get around 5 million doses end March. Well short 20 million. think he/she was. Covid big problem, problem face. imagine continue finding paid find out... Thanks mate kind words.

The trials might used slightly different definitions ""disease prevention"", might used different demographics studies, certainly carried different variants virus done different places different times.

The numbers really directly comparable. AZ trials carried place time Moderna trials, using identical population samples (age, gender, health etc), using definition ""disease prevention"", would results been? know never know. seems highly likely results would good, know good.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Exactly. able get vaccinated 2022? I‚Äôd like see source that. Moderna Biontech alone deliver 910 million doses year alone least supply hold heard AZ causing tons blood clots patients getting vaccine Europe pull it? linked article. Dipshit. US cases declining flat nationally. Germany Italy worlds behind km vaccination, former CDC director Scott gotleib said, ‚Äúit appears longer 6-8 weeks behind Europe, appear leading way pandemic‚Äù 

But hey, local community cases whole world must following trend right? Statistics damned This. buy week earlier would items. covid, would leave loo roll last roll could always nip shop. plan weeks ahead, buy used to, buy different intervals. amazing little need keep home plan effectively, especially meal planning. waste absolutely nothing fill rucksack Aldi live almost month I'm really careful! started calling conspiracy theorists, maybe reread OP comment.

It's 70% effective. conclusion biased UK vaccinated far people countries.

That makes vaccination programme better nothing effectiveness vaccine itself. actual sources say otherwise misleading share 

Im going figure released AZ 70%. Yeah, that's look data state whole. Yes, includes people young Jackson Hole, got back Whitefish, Montana (not terribly different) month ago. saw maybe 4 masks total. Michigan worst day 4 months? metric ? I‚Äôm seeing slight rise still fraction last surge cases deaths person replying to. even read title? didn‚Äôt. used multiple states.

Hahahahahah love winning Germany cases declined fast weeks. 
Vaccination startet slow focused high risc groups.
All seemed going fine... UK variant hit us progress falling appart.

Despite ongoing lockdown new big Covid wave, rising hospitalization numbers likely thousands dead. end sight. 

I really hope US faster vaccination prevent setback. feel safe yet. go downhill fast highly contagious Corona variants. important thing still deaths, people saying take vaccine lower efficacy. advice almost every single relevant medical professional take whatever vaccine offered. 95 66 valid reason refuse take J&amp;J vaccine. Getting tested protect getting COVID might allowed travel things, isn‚Äôt really safe things. beginning, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre together! Stay home protect vulnerable!‚Äù type deal. it‚Äôs turn stay home protect people offered vaccine they‚Äôre refusing so. They‚Äôve expected us give best years lives, have, we‚Äôre punished. Plus I, German resident, won‚Äôt able get vaccinated well 2022 politicians botched vaccine roll badly. politicians? Old people going vaccinated within next months.

Basically, want suffer much make similar sacrifices ones I‚Äôve made them. source? Africa entered chat... dying large numbers 

Agreed statement. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm happy vast majority staying locked listening conspiracy theorists. That's title says thing. Kinda shady come making claims able back evidence, call people ‚Äúconspiracy theorists‚Äù cover ass lol   biontech still needed grant gates foundation *and whole fucking partnering pfizer thing* order even get thing made so, ya know, American capital. Firstly, hasn‚Äôt free market approach - heavily subsidised governments (both directly support research institutes worked private companies). Secondly, Helping? Haha. Funny. Like helping people diabetes. problem US belief pure free market never, never exist, blind eye turned ways state subsidises drives change markets money taxpayers allowing large companies capitalise this. Vaccine development benevolent act - seeing pure profit motive kicking in. rebuttal OP said cases declining overall rising area. another OP uses local data tell use local data form opinion. 

What wrong you? tax dollars already bought huge quantities least 3 different vaccines. Amazing happens state funding subsidizes capitalism. exhausting. I‚Äôm going continue take necessary precautions keep others safe, it‚Äôs mentally debilitating coming sub seeing news variants. coming frequently good news vaccination progress, come across California variants concerning thread people saying things get bad destroys hope me... want informed, it‚Äôs destroying point. See answer makes sense: Covid 3rd leading cause death last year. deaths took place last 3 months. Influenza even top 10. 

During Spanish flu, country wearing masks, social distancing, etc. Yeah, screw company invested billions research development, DARE think rewarded efforts. Innovation driven profits desire self preservation, keep pretending otherwise punishing follow motivators back Stone Age. And? good thing set straight then, boss. way Florida reporting bogus numbers, especially degree makes way worse off. *is* targeting US, US *is* vaccine producer. US vaccine exporter precisely issue. Marburg plant part BT/Pfizer's global supply chain, 2/3 production exported, Germany/EU naively believe ""vaccine nationalism"".

It's likely UK also get doses there. China communist country FYI Bosnia living proof vaccines alone stop surges. 

From result plentiful supplies, **Serbia become best vaccinator Europe Britain**, data collected OurWorldInData shows. **It administered 29.5 doses every 100 people** last week compared 10.5 Germany, country long viewed part world model efficiency good governance, 10.7 France.

So working pretty good clip, five different vaccines approved country, campaign going pretty good.

Testing alone stop surges, masking alone stop surges, restrictions alone stop surges vaccination campaigns alone stop surges. 

It's holistic approach. policies reactions, hopefully based upon data real time get it, making decisions road.

Thank reading. I‚Äôve avoided eating inside restaurant year, 80% friends. Even never capacity limits we‚Äôd done same. whole obey thing stupid alt right talking point. yeah, I‚Äôll keep obeying common sense. ü•¥ many doses AstraZeneca EU exporting UK anyway?

The EU needs keep pressuring AstraZeneca deliver let figure doses come from. 

This seems like acts lady desperate cover mistakes strong leader. 

AstraZeneca communication sucks handling EU contract one large disappointment - frankly fault UK. country halting it. Good day sir. 2 weeks shown strong effectiveness. might internet access and/or knowledge mostly think educated individuals typically understand importance vaccines understand impact society average person less educated person. Educated people typically health conscious probably easier access transportation get vaccination center afford take time form work/life easier well. 

It's going uphill battle convince lot country get vaccinated. I'm worried though. parts could better, overall numbers across country look really encouraging. Clearly Pfizer included category.

And dump large corporations want, lot corps deserve certain regulations penalties immoral things case ""Evil ole Pfizer"" saving asses hyper efficient manufacturing distribution vaccine. hit grand fucking slam Covid vaccine rewarded huge profits. 

And example socialism hybrid economies seem super well Europe right now. EU bungled moved slowly acquisition purchase vaccines they're paying price.

Looks like capitalism pretty well case. think EU exporting vaccines US. would truly staggering considering way US acted far banning exports vaccines, vaccine components, even far vaccines vaccine components they're even using need case. can't even ship US good chance they'll seize goods. entirely non co-operative everyone every possible way.

There huge difference signing agreements something tearing simply never making agreement. Considering idiotic government currently dispute EU side equation taking pelters sides I'd think one fairly obvious.

In event, would expect vaccine ban EU see retaliatory ban vaccine component exports UK EU, used manufacture Pfizer vaccines would denied. Debatable, also beside point. huge chunk Redditors think solution draconian, CCP-style lockdowns everyone *forced* stay home ""experts"" satisfied. is, except Amazon Uber delivery people bring shit work home. France = Europe. EU causing cheap shitty manufacturing.

The EU biggest vaccine manufacturing word, said that, private companies free make deals whoever want.

The rest said nonsense.

Already knowing you‚Äôll miss next target shady.)

The EU sort Defense Act (called article 122, sexy) hasn‚Äôt used yet naively thought countries would help other. used 250.000 vaccine batch Australia AZ shady. 
They can‚Äôt keep saying ‚Äúbut we‚Äôre also helping countries‚Äù getting behind schedule every month. need something way. Send us AZ doses we'll stop sending AZ doses. 

Does seem like circular logic anyone else? Omeprazole wonderful totally shutting acid production good long term. Like 2-8 weeks target. permanent fix, allows stomach time heal simultaneously make lifestyle changes. They‚Äôre literally reporting fact. long overdue. EU produce vaccines UK US getting ordered? Moderna produced Europe ships US right now, Astra Zeneca even delivered 20% promised yet US getting majority Pfizer doses despite produced Europe. Fucking Biden holding 30 million AZ doses even approved.

Good Ursula taking logical decision here. tbh would rather get blood clot die deal ""four weeks"" rest life. state that's two states Texas new strain? Arizona? uk article, big parts media want paint EU enemy, language like seize used intentionally rile readers. Go daily mail prime examples. Yes...Which replied added context... big, big difference blocking vaccines exports distribute population, simply blocking exports vaccine components let rot. 

Sure, difference becomes significantly less consider they'd blocking vaccines used second part patient's vaccine schedule, cutting second doses required lasting protection. expected produced US. right now. US fill-and-finish sites.. contract company include penalties late/under delivering friendly agreement something get around it. never able get contractor complete home project time. many times internet run slower advertised penalty? many times showed dealership find advertised price different actual price? cases sue US, none contracts explicit penalties.

Yes, that's example places amount diversity renewables, point still stands grid needs steady baseline come either fossil fuels, nuclear, large amounts storage.

It's vastly economical, environmental scalable renewables balanced nuclear baseline mind-boggling amount lithium-based energy storage. besides, moot still huge amounts coal gas burnt need taken offline **now**. time picky fossil fuel replacements. quote says exactly point, feel benefits outweigh risks. get clear that, clearly continued vaccination position.

But EU AZ confidence actively undermined presidents claiming vaccine quasi effective, suggesting 8% efficacy, etc recent pause based adverse events building back refusals based side effects inadaquecy. fact many regions EU large chunks limited supply unused, whilst bemoaning UK sending vaccine produced domestically, make whole lot sense.

No, absolutely commitments Canada some.  originally committed 4 million doses Canada end March.  upped commitment 5.5 million doses.  Likewise, commitment 2nd quarter increased nearly 5 million original
Commitment was. million doses AZ delivered far. population 450m people. Nothing counties California purple tier lowest number daily new cases since whole thing began, literally better jts since first lockdown done anybody paying vaccine pocket? this, already low public opinion public health officials sink further. Fair enough, thought UK Dutch plant only. Hoping get whacked tornado. Weather wild. Like animals. 

What's viruses bacteria far dangerous Covid-19 (which 99.99% survival rate young healthy adults)? certificates diseases too? mean treating like animals might well go in. Go ahead laugh. US industrialized country hard time concept. need get better fitted mask Yes, EU nationalists seemingly content countrymen women dieing governments playing politics *fucking vaccine*. vaccines paid Governments pay taxes ""keep safe."" I'd suggest telling local government buy less cruise missiles pony cash life saving medicines. anyone make money? Checkmate üòé obviously concept size UK capacity produce vaccines. US 40 x bigger UK. UK needs import vaccines, never going able produce enough population, let alone become major exporter. banning exports, initial doses AZ never meant exported, always intended domestic use. New That's honestly even weirder. desperate EU vaccines much AZ wants back, bizarre end long. bloodbath

Sit breathe, you‚Äôre jumping wayyyyy ahead here. 

Hospitalizations dropping TX despite opening up. Warm weather vaccines working. news outlets sensationalist clicks, don‚Äôt take seriously. context risk virus, is! EU Member State, merely Member European Economic Area party European Medicines Agency subject (but all) European regulations.

It's full member ema, part vaccine scheme. death rate per capita still even 20 worldwide countries lockdown like Spain, France, Italy, Uk etc still much much worse.

They hit earlier. Sweden time stop wave death last spring failed so. sure restrictions don‚Äôt mask mandates public transport like recommendations

The public transport mask rules NZ enforced. single person fined compliance 50% most. also widespread public transport like Europe impacts extremely people. shops bars open since pandemic, never suffered economic consequences lockdown. 

The correlation tightness lockdowns economic harm opposite claiming. Nations tighter lockdowns suffered less GDP loss. NZ seen spikes unemployment retail hospitality sector saved V-shaped recovery. That's thanks people feeling safe go shop. quite frankly we've 13K deaths population 10M, that's literally nothing all.

What callous horrific thing say. US lost people WWI, WWII Vietnam combined, single year. Sweden historically neutral nation can't even compare death toll past wars. 2.5x deadlier flu vaccines whole world already open completely.

Every piece evidence seen says number completely wrong. bad flu season kills 60,000 US. far 540,000 dead Covid. IFR 6 10 times flu since also twice infectious means kill 12 20 times many people. new variants infectious deadlier, numbers getting worse. 

Once everyone vaccinated course open up, even close yet. Italy fully vaccinated 3% population. NZ we've vaccinated 15,000 people 5 million. would stupid open early. people scared mild ass virus feel free stay home dubble mask &amp; face shield vaccinated, let us normal people get normal lives already.

And prove Covid denier ignore argument. hoaxer death cultist happy kill everyone's grandparents avoid wearing mask... because... freedumb? without lockdowns fine keep fine.

Sweden 1,299 dead per million. NZ 5 dead per million. sure, lockdown countries lockdown countries like watching vulnerable members society suffer slow painful deaths. literally point lockdown never get rid covid. 

Not locking leads collapse hospital system. Sweden protected literally forbidding nursing home patients sent hospitals, letting die beds mass numbers first wave. Brazil's system collapsing now. Italy's hospital system collapsed first wave locked down. NZ among fewest ICU beds per capita developed world, let virus get even close levels reached Europe would total collapse medical system. NZ still covid cases even though got ""rid"" it.

No, community cases. even one. cases border hotels, picked overseas. case slips stop spreading, every single time. course forever. get people vaccinated. We've got enough vaccines purchased vaccinate everyone September. would unbelievably stupid abandon successful strategy now. US export anything UK till fully vaccinated. 500 million doses go. infected dead... variant gone, problem solved Texans memory goldfish people getting rare blood clots (there normally 5 cases TOTAL Germany per year 10 people took vaccine) fairies assume? replied someone else wanted tell I‚Äôm 37 weeks due get second shot next Friday (about week due date). OB said rate pregnant women‚Äôs reactions, they‚Äôre finding practice/talking practices, rate reactions significantly lower pregnant women. working theory since pregnant woman‚Äôs immune response lowered time, don‚Äôt extreme side effects! 

Definitely talk OB, wanted chime I‚Äôm also weird position make choice crazy time! pretty sure exactly trial discussed weeks ago. Can‚Äôt wait defend NEEN KNOWN NINE FUCKING MONTHS. admins ignorant adding spread virus ignorance. Thank this, hard reason OCD inherently illogical thing me! helps lot won‚Äôt open tourism anytime soon? Ah alright. used get kid told longer used it. It‚Äôs definitely good resource works cux kid hold shots cuz mortified needles lmao. things mutually exclusive? rate J&amp;J producing at? crowd ongoing government enforced lockdowns full year pandemic began side ‚Äúbrainwashed‚Äù. Unbelievable shit read site sometimes. work virology lab Delaware. small number facilities state receive process covid tests, one them. So, pretty good idea things looking. honestly, we‚Äôre still really slow. Yesterday kind busy, vast majority tests still negative. guess we‚Äôve seen slight increase positive tests, depends day. According data here, things still trending all. Someone else replied comment study. Looks like provide degree protection, far data limited. wife boat. robust studies influenza antibodies vaccinated mothers infants give good indication Hmmm. number people getting dying dengue fever summer Covid. Europeans lower priority. 

Tough choices prioritization ethics. US dog fight, matter hard try make do. Thrombotic events occur commonly absence vaccination. noted rates thrombotic events higher vaccine recipients expected background rate... signals identified UK 11 million doses administered date.

Nice. Common sense, FUD. Meanwhile 65 yr old parents NC still haven‚Äôt gotten shot im ok never hear guy again. dont recommed taking vaccine,i got vaccine dick 6 inch shorter still lottery part Canada paid vaccines private companies plants US means want free vaccines? months hearing get passed generation generation... whats this? face massive fines beatings protest... democracy. simply true. shit world gave us, it‚Äôs truly incredible see badly EU fucked vaccine process compared fucking trump administration vaccine, supply chain. Texas stayed flat since getting rid mask mandates? Novavax Curevac probably approved Q2 deliveries June earliest. lot depends J&amp;J deliveries. Abject uneducated speculation, maybe virus still present tissue vaccine triggers immune response mops up, perhaps immune system getting first infection reaction vaccine gives another chance. EU needs vaccines right now, even stupid AZ vaccination stop enough, AZ delivering promised vaccines. Yes, talking manufacturing Pfizer uses plant Belgium (and exports UK) whilst Germany EU invested another plant (in Germany) Biontech's. make jab two different companies. I‚Äôm 37 weeks got first moderna 34 weeks 5 days, I‚Äôll week away due date get second shot. zero side effects first shot (besides sore arm one day). Still, I‚Äôm looking toward second, worried fever element close due date, talked doctor yesterday, asking delay case side effects second shot. 
She said absolutely delay, although it‚Äôs full-blown widely studied thing yet, pregnant women seem much much lower cases reactions since immune response much lower time (something happens keep body attacking baby foreign entity). said basically haven‚Äôt *any* reactions reported them, it‚Äôs imperative get scheduled. 

Congrats impending child, hope everything goes smoothly us :) Stimulus checks + summer weather + vaccinated people

Summer going live whether like not. got back whitefish weeks ago. Def saw half wear guidelines state, half dont give fuck lol. Best explain people wear them, wont scold others dont. Truly individualist paradise. Yeah, insane hopeful weirdos actually think normal possibility again. I've already bought ranch Wyoming, trips town full PPE hazmat gear. little bubble live lives on. 1. commitments quarterly, weekly, basically every country.  Pfizer give weekly schedules forecasts, adjust equate failing 'deliver time'. Exactly said going happened happened. saw dip deliveries late January - early February making us now.
2.  delay week.  got 445k expected week.  Pfizer revised commitment 5.5 million Q1, Canada due recieve 445k every week March them. they've committed doses, starting next week, anticipating 1.2 million next 2 weeks million week least 2nd week May.
3. Pfizer delay delayed second shot (the fact delayed second shot make single dose...). made decision delay over, based overall projected future supply risk-reward public health analysis strongly favoured getting everyone first shot next 3-4 months giving second doses happens. Ok. claim ""options."" I'm aware are, enumerate options? type protection last long. similar women close giving birth get another Tdap regardless current. helps newborn stay resistant get vaccines. anyone know vaccinated mother's breast milk vaccinate kids young shot?  It‚Äôs probably 28th 29th let clickbait headline thing breaks you. really close end thing, vast majority us fine end it, however turns out. 

I'm sure vaccine situation worldwide start improve quickly, everyone industry government feeling pressure make move faster. Uk supply AZ gets SII. also 17 mil ordered Moderna, due start April manufactured Switzerland. also it‚Äôs plant make novavax- starting maybe May/June. issue 2nd dose Pfizer. E.U blocks elderly ppl getting second dose- god would bad look. even UK running trials different vaccines mixed. guess push comes shove could that. think EU sees existential threat. sure approach going favours. vaccine? Question: EU export vaccines UK US? dispute exactly here. still give nose sprays kids. knew medical tyranny would welcomed thunderous applause. doubt doses India still go approval process prior roll out. double negative wording? expected safe. points variants matter anymore. Even mutates every year faster vaccine, humanity especially young people gonna decide stay perpetually lockdown. year taught us anything, much like prohibition, laws restricting basic human behavior work. world would turn bunch underground restaurants/bars house parties. Biontech Pfizer vaccine. got first dose 38w complications, beautiful 1.5w old baby now, likely slight immunities COVID!

The risk viral injury pregnant person known significant, risks vaccine minimal.

I glad need take second dose days giving birth, little worried I'll severe reaction sole caregiver kiddo, omg thankful immunities already. That‚Äôs exactly doing. country powerful enough force US change policy. simply won‚Äôt happen. it‚Äôs companies delivering commitments. anything, Britain Sweden punished.

But Lipids.... meme now, Avanti Lipids send components Britain, thinking UK reached vaccine autarchy import componets continet pure delusion. Ta-dah! issue 2nd dose Pfizer. 

Absolutely. hope whatever happens this, least EU decency send 2nd doses vaccines needed.

I think case ban happens take long. Maybe 1 month enough put EU good pace population get angry vaccine roll-out. Well, can't ""tweak"" PCR test detect specific variants ? Still enough testing see vaccine mother affects baby. Autism, mental development delays anything physical could still well side affect Hopefully odds low crowd find way dismiss that. ""Who cares? Life's short, nature's way reducing population. Everything fine, anyone cares least bit extreme nut get attacked downvoted."" answer fund research taxes, massively. ends buying vaccines medicine? Healthcare systems, paid taxes something comparable taxes. Might well cut middle man. exactly anyone believe 70 million promise promised 40 million Q1 (reduced already) end delivering maybe 20 million.  EU country. one paying it?? Trust me, paying it‚Äîor pay it, terms higher insurance premiums, higher taxes, etc. 40,000 flu deaths per year would normal amount. years more. years less. That‚Äôs WITHOUT social distancing, masking mandates wide scale mask use, stay home orders, business shutdown/restrictions. 

Covid killed 500,000+ US year level restrictions place. 

The flu nowhere near deadly. even close. *curb music* already dead. tested 8 dead people. Please stop spreading bad information. low percentage people vaccinated people dont want to, people responsible vaccine rollout disaster dealing irrelevant bullshit instead solving mess made.

NOTHING else important getting ramping vaccination rollout ASAP don‚Äôt think get it. one cares think risk YOU. one gives fuck YOU. People give fuck people higher chance dying don‚Äôt want fucking die. literally sacrifice made wearing mask, keeping 6 feet apart, getting vaccine. slight annoyance keeping others safe. refuse that, guess what, you‚Äôre selfish asshole. Celebrating 2nd socially distant birthday. Come WA, open 40+ ready! would turn away someone eligible? won‚Äôt . provide source this? I'm reading EMA website, best find [this statement released investigation ongoing, EMA currently remains view benefits AstraZeneca vaccine preventing COVID-19, associated risk hospitalisation death, outweigh risks side effects.

It comment decisions made member states - simple says side effects negligible - continued opinion. know yet! week! Let's see happens Spring Break larger gatherings. takes 2-14 days Covid incubate, know ANYTHING yet today ECDC tracker says AZ delivered 15.8 million doses far. even hit 20 million Q1. even bother read article? Ah, gotcha. course good news Moderna probably Pfizer, two weeks first dose 80% 90% protection. still works ok. 100% this. time consider right balance whether means (unfortunately) vulnerable population care take increased responsibility protect moving forward rather shutting economy, livelihoods, education completely everyone. Vaccines Germany still restricted people 80+, emergency/medical personnel teachers, we're likely get large supply May.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yep. problem ""blood test"" antibody test unreliable late illness, getting deep respiratory sample requires surgery. may simple reliable way hospital clinic get test looks this.

It's concerning (if true) suspect reason current PCR tests pick multiple mutations binding sites PCR looks for. could mean significant change pathogenicity virus possible immune escape well. 

It's still way early know much potentially big issue. Good point - agree annoyance sanitation theater - problem still remains exchange marginal improvement business we're taking hell risk. 100% sure yet looking like say today. drug trialed 30,000 people seems good. main reason ran trials diverse country is. last point struggle. Personal responsibility absolutely include responsible folks around you. think make black white issues. I'd love get 8 &amp; 10 year old kids vaccinated ASAP. shit. Thats phase 2 3 trials seriously say Covid causes ""the sniffles?"" I've read studies damage every organ system, including one recommending doctors watch patients ""testicular lesions."" 

""The sniffles."" Go volunteer Covid ward think sniffles. see people vents slowly drowning lungs fill bloody glue. come exactly? see, that‚Äôs interesting adds dynamic didn‚Äôt know existed. I‚Äôd assumed EU doses also developed Belgium plant. constantly worry stuff. Worst turn away point that's ridiculous. Exactly. prepared pause vaccinations order investigate possible issues, kind thing builds trust recommendations health agencies.  countries I'd hesitant ones plough regardless without necessary due diligence. That's answer question? saying low percentage people vaccinated initiatives made? imo that's preposterous. 27 weeks now, received vaccine doses - concerns far! OB visits confirm healthy baby (as far know). Glad hear newborn well! Nobody issue investigated. concerns stopping vaccinations third wave due incredibly rare events - something goes recommendations.

The number people dying due lack vaccines far significant deaths 17 million doses may even related all. hot, humid, sunny almost year. saw summer cases dropped lot summer North America Europe. Also, state designed around cars spaced out, unlike dense Europe, NYC, etc. like everyone maskless, people still wear higher risk locations like grocery stores. Every life ought preserved protected . Period qualify... overthinking this, get it. know social media real life, Twitter: yes. really unbearable even coming ""unsuspicious"" sources like Financial Times foreign correspondent. ""EU hurting citizens spite UK"".

Social media worst :( Imagine actually believing live Texas, guess largest cities (DFW, Austin, Houston) educated largely Democratic. correlation things mask wearing. always believed trade personally feel emergency workers healthcare workers high risk individuals vaccinated time. 

You wrong. Reopening done cause spike cases, right now.

I think reopening tied specific % population receiving vaccines, mask mandates enforced Herd Immunity reached. Again, masks nothing mild annoyance effective preventing spread disease. I'd fine forced wear another year people get shots that's takes, wearing mask public really big deal. 

I think *profoundly* selfish people think wearing masks great sacrifice vs potentially saving even one life.

As I've said elsewhere thread, mask wearing works it. Saying personally choose wear mask insist others virtue signaling woke theater- trying show considerate safe actually caring people die not. farce. would imagine U.K would respond export block said components

I read argument couple times subreddit, can't figure first came idea.

International affairs importance ain't treated like 8 year old kids playing football, owner ball loses match forced sit out, grabs ball heads home nobody else play.

There would tremendous backlash UK move similar that. big, big difference blocking vaccines exports distribute population, simply blocking exports vaccine components let rot.

If UK place send vaccine components, ban could reality. can't anything them, simply blocking exports stopping production really harming whole world, blackmailing purposes? would go well international, really well. testing volume gone way down. consistently 30+ per day get 1-2 day. jump since governor's opened state up. made someone really angry üòÇüòÇüòÇ sweet release death great vacation.
just patient man discovered variant testing DEAD BODIES. course 8 found dead, that's place he's looking. Depends whether website let you. CvS still asking 65 plus.  Probably depends live. Texas mask mandate ended restrictions loosened March 10th. article exactly spell dates ""over past week"", let's say March 10th 16th. means people exposed average March 5th March 11th.

Yes, Texas mask mandate removal apply retroactively make people sick removed.

I expect make massive difference even going future, least short term - mask mandate specifically 1% cases per day start, growing 1.8%, even adding effects restrictions, coming month determined variants issues, vaccines. bit gamble, could easily risk worth taking, idk.

Not worth inverting causality discarding science tho. deal virus risk killing chunks generation? Yes, hard go vacation one two cases. Dallas, can't tell mandate ended. People still wearing masks Exactly - hopefully that, vaccinations, people already sick we'll fine. hate we're needlessly taking risk. \^ feel sort verge one really scaring post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.
