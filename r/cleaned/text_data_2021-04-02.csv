0,2021-04-02," one those! Got second shot I‚Äôm grateful good example someone put together lot words straight ass. act know fact even origin virus uncertain, yet confidently scaremongering. Let problem solve itself.

It solve itself. number anti-vaxxers *wildly* exaggerated. Social media makes sound like every person anti-vaxxer. They're loud. get lot press. numbers small matter get vaccinated not. going small bump Covid tries fourth wave. Luckily, going outrun vaccine US. shown appreciable change since last week. Usually would seeing exponential growth point. happened Israel UK happen US soon. makes infinitely happy, time feel terrible majority world's population hope receiving vaccine while. us extremely lucky. thoughts come. deadbolt thing something I've started obsessing adult, I've found key thing focus too. me, focusing issue- focused yesterday, I? Maybe I'm remembering locked properly yesterday! something weird whenever Important Task- repeat line poetry, touch toes, whatever. completely eliminates obsessive tendencies remember it. Mind using recent estimates US population? adults US 18.

333,153,979 current population US.

This means 204.5 million end May 79.3% adult population, 76.9%. That's full 2.4% away reaching herd. certainly side effects! 8 hours later (on dot) fever, chills, body aches, headache. intense, honestly. 

That said, misunderstood stuff taking pain killers thought taking could reduce efficacy, tried tough out. realized could take pain relievers, took NyQuil Ibuprofen went bed. 

Woke 4:00am symptoms gone never returned. all, guess wasn‚Äôt HORRIBLE, wasn‚Äôt easy peasy, either! fat doesn‚Äôt hurt people. one cares. guy fucking idiot post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

I‚Äôd rather heard truth could made cloth mask, know doesn‚Äôt think aren‚Äôt ready hear truth 4th wave too? first approximation, probably accurate say beneficially Integrated society likely follow rules/advice. 5/5 club!

The best part say birthday's Cinco de Mayo people ask ""when's that?""

My family fully vaccinated then! Best birthday present ever! Yep heavy cardstock way easier anyone fake. stole credit another operating system?!?

And he's back stealing Apple's ideas! Little known fact: Apple included copy iOS 2014 flu vaccines. veteran lung problems pre-existing conditions. got call state month earlier getting vaccination VA gave me. time got call VA gotten 2nd dose. They're way fucking behind ballgame areas.  state based race alone? Holy shit mean point vaccine medicine going tested/trialed amount people. That's works. imagine lot testing hoops jump prior allowed test humans limit risks possible. *at least 6 months. reason it‚Äôs effective 6 months it‚Äôs 6 months that‚Äôs observe. could effective 5 years; It‚Äôll take us 5 years find like Windows Vista...

IIRC, one rather large memory footprint time many PCs still shipped 1 GB RAM. also seems like Windows 8 (the original release send bunch emergency security patches optimized getting door quickly rather preserving performance) last OS worked well conventional spinning platter boot drives. Making job inconvenient old standard getting rid someone.

Oh, layoffs? sorry, transferred job elsewhere. welcome keep move. change. Everyone 16+ eligible April 15th WA are, dropped yesterday:  hit second wave? thought one long wave.  know exactly related, reason federal programs (VA native tribes) received higher amount doses (relative population cover) states? know really eats me. state employee, give 9% salary next 2 years anticipation tax revenue would take dip. hope union takes account renegotiate current contract ends. said before, ramping vaccinations. Biden trying 3 weeks April 19th get 17,000 pharmacies 40,000. going interesting see J&amp;J throw away 15 million vaccines mix ingredients trying crank vaccines 24/7. got good maintenance people keeping machines preventative upkeep. read vaccine effective six months, need vaccinated again? Yeah I‚Äôm Illinois even though work public every day still haven‚Äôt qualified yet. üòî got Moderna told I'll immunity two weeks first dose. Based data, probably fine time get second. Heck even older covidiots won't.

There's lots deniers even Q whackjobs $work, truly believe even someone died change folks opinion.  Truly mind boggling that's putting mildly. try shaming crap turn back haha. wearing one mask? Don‚Äôt understand Fauci‚Äôs guidance?!  grandmother died COVID reckless people like you! I‚Äôm there! Got first Pfizer dose Thursday. 

I‚Äôm happy state opened people‚Äîthese vaccines find willing arms, wherever are. think nationally, 'hospitalizations' best metric point.

I agree--with people vaccinated, decent chance may still able catch test positive (thus counting positive case), extremely unlikely become severely ill need hospitalization. Fellow vaccinated friends, anyone else experience bad chills/rigors second shot? I‚Äôm 12 hours shaking like leaf. got Pfizer vaccine. Hoping symptoms decide pop tonight I‚Äôm bumpy ride. all. Maybe bad previous surges, call 63k 7-day average upslope trend ""over."" 

Just hold horses people! close!!! That's interesting. There's lot indication waiting longer jabs might better, might better long haul. choice, would get pfizer. Less likely leave side effects like dizziness/fever justifies lying public? not. Definitely. conservative hatechristians reason we‚Äôre still god damned mess. People must love Pfizer that‚Äôs politically charged. valid reasons suspending vaccine This. refuse extremely proud it, infuriate stay smugly calm, meaning lose.  surprised Month 4 largest month entire vaccination campaign entirety.

Month | Percentage Equivalent Fully Vaccinated
---|---
1 (Dec 14 - Jan 14) | 1.8%
2 (Jan 15 - Feb 14) | 6.5% (8.3% cumulative)
3 (Feb 15 - March 14)| 7.8 % (16.1% cumulative)
4 (March 15 - Apr 14) | 8.2% (24.3% cumulative)

11 days left count Month 4 already highest. hard beat 12-13% cumulative month, Month 5 best bet. 78% cap vaccinated 18 older. We're already 1/3 way there, stragglers start take effect soon. expect =/= potential It‚Äôs amazing easy republicans manipulate enslave lies, man. would another wave? It‚Äôs election year. Two pronged theory: medical professionals obvious reasons, basket weaving / jazz dance / women‚Äôs studies / etc PhD‚Äôs work service jobs due loss university sponsorship. think it‚Äôs 12 weeks jabs whatever vaccine here. know mother Pfizer one, don‚Äôt know I‚Äôll have. tell people ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs chip that‚Äôs phone‚Äù shut pretty quickly. Sounds like Florida.  sister, lives there, sent vids. think though varies place place. closest university, well community colleges online. said, there's noticeable change behavior last month. Consequently cases up. would like ask author thinks fat shaming Windham County NAACP leads vaccination clinics Brattleboro, Bennington Rutland Burlington clinic operated Racial Justice Alliance Vermont Professionals Color Call center workers repeatedly signed BIPOC students confirmed eligibility based racial identity. 

Not american maybe missing nuance sounds bit weird. BIPOC code word anyone except white? understand Racial Justice Alliance operates clinic. got Racial Justice? 

 get principle, less people color vaccinated want get vaccinated reason ever expressly prohibited based fact BIPOC? 

If coming solution vaccinate BIPOC prohibit anyone white face value really seem appropriately ethical strategy (is even legal discriminate based race life saving treatment?) Unless I'm missing something seems designed equalize numbers

would even work problem low vaccination rate specific groups wanting get vaccinated lower numbers? ""It's risky way it."", still anecdote. facts without science science done lab. truly absolutely know much anything. I'm reporting spreading misinformation pandemic. needs removed.

Canada currently wrapping vaccination older population frees ICU beds younger demographics. natural occurence indication variants ""killing infecting younger people faster""

This fear mongering trash media needs banned internet. allowed posted? Right. Except hospitalizations always couple weeks behind cases. 55 Ontario get name on.list appointments  could go adapt social distancing mask etiquette fine getting back ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù California tax revenues roof. far know, free everyone America. insurance, ask provide name insurance charge them, don't, they'll jab anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

I got pfizer. Waited 21 days, got second jab last week. family, including aunts, uncles, cousins, got mix pfizer moderna. Moderna longer wait (4 weeks) anyone heard likely need another round vaccinations fall? wonder viable businesses allow full capacity. Seemed small businesses survive even 50% restrictions. said wear masks first. We'll see yet another lie. Today day 14 past second dose Moderna. Free last. That's joke. literally throwing away 9% doses due certain needles getting all? Wtf say thing would burn April. Imagine countless lives couldve spared drag half US kicking screaming. Soon everything back normal, masks thing past half fucking country whined bitched like petulant children. Um, idea googled, one first results article called: ""Covid‚Äôs Cassandra: Swift, Complicated Rise Eric Feigl-Ding."" Presumably, kind people think penalty fake $20 death. BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL love figure get ""Surge"" somewhere. Linger mean sorry buzzkill, even vaccine available, statistically, 100-150k people would refused take it. love ""I'm putting something body know what's it!"" people.

Most already routinely eating processed foods fast foods, they're worried unknown ingredients maybe start there. Brilliant hair-splitting. Israel occupies militarily, steals land, prevents interacting normally rest world, ""not muh citizens."" Probably true. Although maybe 'smart', personal quality, exactly right word context. in, doctor average would come much privileged background. Lol what. also said wear masks before. said normal 2022. said don‚Äôt hug parents shit. dude smart course sound bytes absurd. I'm American living Scotland, I'm 46. I'm still waiting vax.... 


If went back States could get right now. stopped trusting long ago. Check Fauci's history think shocked. me, could anyone. Yeah, tell Fauci went movies today 3 weeks getting Pfizer vaccine. I'll second shot next Friday Walgreen's schedules 4 weeks whatever reason.

I figured 80% protection pretty good, checked seating chart right movie starting (well, previews starting) saw 3 people ENORMOUS theater. safer physical therapy last month. sound like kind person tries sound smart telling people try sound smart try sound smart time.

Can't wait see downvotes people miss joke country mile roll in! Seems like brainer. Give AZ men, others women everyone knows literally nothing ""perfectly healthy"" ""dead,"" right? 3rd wave? thought danger killed California‚Äôs economy restrictions made sense? That‚Äôs good, must well organised supplied area. get one jab wait 12 weeks second. assume it‚Äôs there? CDC lady scared still. You‚Äôre pretty much good first dose, immortal rules Zombieland dictate:

Rule 2: Double Tap wasn‚Äôt aware days ago aren‚Äôt fully vaccinated roughly 2 weeks second fauci ouchie. end sight! second Thursday, pumped. Congrats! Doubt anything close winter, wirh vaccinations taking shape. fuck‚Äôs going Michigan? Living household people sick definitely changes equation. Luckily official guidance people around others 10 days first symptoms. 9 days really close probably infectious anymore. hear ""Challenge Accepted"" remotest, reddest parts nation? Yeah doubt anyone careful get vaccine alright alright exponential growth go. second shot sucked, day/day half. small price pay. Even ""suck"" basically like 6/10 cold. Doug Ford ready 4th wave. end someone make calls wait ICU close full, start closing things. Patients take 2-4 weeks end ICU infection. today's cases hit ICU month. 

We north 1000 ICU beds. 

Be sure thank years austerity never ending hunt efficiency. He‚Äôs saying do- that‚Äôs point headlines ""vaccinated people dying Brazil"" actually vaccinated. damage news like would cause worldwide. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre arguing here. read interview Whitty said exactly entire time. He‚Äôs made clear he‚Äôs Scientific advisor, politician. headline total misrepresentation words (shock) interview argument ending restrictions exact reasons outline.. Got mine 2 hours ago. whole family officially vaccinated getting together Sunday first time since March 8th, 2020. 99.8% chance fine.

If get infected, going air transmission parents rubbed eye touched mask second. hobo kicked McDonalds shirt shoes? observation correct. condition however rare, official documents report condition happens higher rate vaccinated population much would expected.

Now, correlation equal causation, correlation *start*.

The issue investigated blood clots rare blood disorders, involving thrombocytopenia, combined CVST (also rare, together *rare*). enough, patients antibodies platelets.

As now, link seems likely. EMA give official response April 9 general view vaccinated likely pretty much want. said would somewhat careful crowded bars restaurants time case numbers come little bit more. going happen month maybe 6 weeks. think things like indoor dining vaccinated going gyms stuff like totally fine. personal opinion though agree. Vietnam also done phenomenal job keeping virus bay everyday public health measures collective sacrifice/cooperation amongst them. deserve support this. curious US might Israel-like situation, R &lt; 1 even economy pretty much full. rhytm, maybe June? Adding also decent level natural immunity. nation sociopaths Getting vaccinated next weekend ü•∞Pfizer! took Tylenol per recommendation.

Brought Fujifilm apparently? Work decades public health education get back me. Scare mongering suggests basically lying exactly nothing lie here. article left discussion concerning variants already knew Pfizer pretty good South African variant. Early scientists worried mutations virus mutates half rate flu viruses, others correct, expressed concern since much easier transmit, mutations could much become problem. Even US begun set system monitoring them, including emergence new ones. good reason think people need regular vaccination flu, indeed new formulations already tested address variants. understanding science always changing limitations various subject mean fear mongering. Would fact touched top mask putting change equation? even kidding, MI. Easily found appointment looked rural, red areas. Made mini road trip it.

Not gonna feel guilty eligible people willingly declining vaccine. Yes is. think vaccines work? many people get vaccines, there's still possibility hospitals overwhelmed people get sick. convenient thing motorcycles there's one two people crash time. sure cause way he‚Äôs talking doesn‚Äôt seem way assume guidance anything forced. Hawaii still requires negative tests kids spread others. 

Happened kids school. Parent symptoms exposure. Sent kid school instead quarantining kid results came back. Kid tested positive despite asymptomatic source spread several others ... expose families.

""Reasonable people"". social life barely changed all, simply became easier decline invites remember reading good article early pandemic saying almost certain would 5-7 waves, virus peters became occasional illness late 2022, early 2023. 

The author accurately predicted second wave would deadliest, almost certainly vaccine would circulating early mid 2021, would reduce severity waves second one, later waves would affecting people less likely die coronavirus. wish could find article see author predicted variants causing later, serious waves. That‚Äôs vaccines work get nonetheless hear you. I'm dual citizen Finn-American done almost 2 months. 75 year old great uncle Helsinki got first shot long ago kid goes college Finland still looking summer ETA. get soon, however. faith stay safe. That‚Äôs vaccines work get nonetheless get upvote, friend! re-opened restaurants February, schools (plus sports) almost back face face. Restaurants stores packed. Anecdotally, nearly everyone know traveling, family gatherings, etc. one taking seriously anymore. Lots StOp LiViNg fEaR around here. said expects keep bad that's wave. And, know, masks keep distance. Got shot today! Fowch spoken Dr Fauci throws shit wall see sticks. Egotistical maniac. dose administered goes arm. reported CDC reports it. 3.975m doses reported today, doses administered across slew dates, mostly within past week. might want check sub rules want toxic topic. :) Thanks!!! took multiple trips there. world living in? scientist father bond variants, vaccines aspects covid time. brother mad recommending get vaccine. Hopefully accelerating pace vaccinations counter this. Keep getting vaccines soon able variants hit wall vaccinated people go! under-reacting schools open.  Alberta's Health Minister stated several days ago nearly 90% ICU people 65 under. I've got part already. I've 1st dose Pfizer vax. part get I'm hearing vaccinated still pass others? 'variants concern' indeed seen spike changes, hence worries vaccine escape. least one study suggested AZ (of course!) less effective (for mild/moderate, data severe) SA variant - extent SA government ceased using AZ vaccine drive. Notable also UK governments vigorous (and believe successful) efforts track handful SA variant cases made UK. Israel maintaining tight border controls much reason. ever, check latest updates. might scientist know someone works Vaccines said takes 20 years develop vaccine. worries me. don‚Äôt believe go .org site documents it. I‚Äôm hear argue good got vaccine, want hear everyone‚Äôs experiences it. judge bully want educate weigh pros cons.

Science killed one relatives day excuse mistrusting. friend whose family similar situation. see extended family members, couple Covid positive (but didn‚Äôt know yet). gets flu level sick week later. 

She‚Äôs kinda knots, knowing interacted family member husband/kids interacted tested +. Despite working schooling home, she‚Äôs one got sick, family tested negative. 

This virus definitely weird. Glad enjoyed it! Maybe you‚Äôre superhuman! ;) great news potential preview future: 50% least one shot, 80% decline hospitalizations. care get Bad bot Man, I'm trying baby anything I'm experiencing significant sides (chills, aches) second pfizer shot earlier today. Hanging on. I'd rather deal ventilator guess say. literally proves **my** point lol. best thing covid going away hear douchebag again. going say, source seem match title's claim. He's saying severe, happen.

Unfortunately, lot people read titles even see correction.. People test positive PCR tests 90 days... Yeah Pfizer, two weeks first dose 80%, two weeks second dose 90+%. 

Everyone still get second dose skip it, definitely cautious (especially two weeks vaccine takes effect body builds antibodies, dont want catch COVID this), nearly clear first dose taken full effect. Woohoo!

It cool trippy also got paid nice. checked moment ago, one -- exactly one -- appointment available, 450 miles away Odessa.

In terms side effects , people it‚Äôs soreness shoulder , similar flu shot. Occasionally people get fever nausea 24 hours it‚Äôs rare (less 10%). reactions actually good , means immune response body. funny enough I'm project bunch data gathered every year different countries- far I'm seeing biggest positive relationship trust/belief science usefulness highest level education. PhDs MS/MA level bit MDs professional degrees that's difference. HS AA statistically significant relationship.

Data messy SES, subjective class seemed connection actual income.

Political scientists... Hey buddy, honestly, truly love hold tongue action couple weeks. love defined mouth mouth engagements anyway. ha-ha, downvoted you. ha-ha. gonna 100 million 2 tommorow :D got second dose 1st, hit like truck today. I‚Äôm ready next two weeks breeze by! Cases roaring summer fall. never break. appears paying attention grave situation Brazil I've got two forgot bring mine second shot. Maybe take advantage. /S great job Anything personally don‚Äôt like far right days Uhh.. Even u vaccinated, u still spread virus. affects symptom seriousness Yep. need pull Sinovac roster available ones. Brazil found 50% effective read bare minimum approved. Neither I, neither author, think! course. Sorry can't help more. fully vaccinated Summer, think people country able say same. 



I've got first dose scheduled 12th. mid May I'll fully vaccinated. Can't wait! 40 lbs quit smoking. Going bar gonna quite test. Holy shit... fourth wave happen, expect back normal? gotten mine yet sure everything It‚Äôs ironic cause everyone complaining lately cautiousness everyone else. It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs still threat something haven‚Äôt reached herd immunity yet. hope next two months though. Exciting stuff First dose Pfizer books. can‚Äôt wait lick everything again.  thing knows stay media limelight little bit observer like scientist observe make conclusion. 

Right, scientist. scientific conclusion scientists take it. conclusion different, deciding think smarter, fact make anti-vaxxer. read articles vaccine manufacturers government website say thing know long term side effects latter worse. 

Yes science, publish long term effect long term effects publish. basically year since trials, nothing report far. FDA Approval process **rigorous** test possible effects, passed. significant chance whatsoever long term effects. completely 100% worse saying ""the latter worse."" also say vaccine websites approved FDA passed medical emergency. 

False. approved FDA. sign waiver anything happens uncomfortable part.

False. literally to. Reasonable people okay wearing masks crowded, public places 100 year global pandemic. think problem people forget SARS-cov-2 vaccine 100 % effective.

So chance vaccinated people go around spreading virus. sure kicked mine Thanks :) I‚Äôve sent message doctor. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll respond it‚Äôs holiday weekend. answer definitely no. Children currently at-home / online class saying teachers mostly building school  tell local surf spots. year got crowded CA curtailed one life's passions quite bit. may true, parents don‚Äôt option staying home school aged children. Mask wearing benefit teachers at-risk parents too. kids also don‚Äôt even complain masks, do, it‚Äôs probably mentality picked home. Well newer numbers out. think 70% adults get now. puts number immune people us 47%, 58% one includes natural infections. Trump meant it'll gone Easter 2 big notes:Brazil fall season right now, remember seasons work Southern Hemisphere?
Also, Brazil giving sort crap trying curb spread compared CA tons things stop spread. makes much sense - time spent school equals knowledge understanding practicing critical reasoning, evaluating sources etc. masks forever? thought 100 days? article misleading. According Texas DHS site almost 90% vaccines shipped Texas make arms Texans. double posted, go it. It‚Äôs necessarily issue money. many districts majority staff report feeling unsafe, can‚Äôt run district accommodations majority teachers work home. Teachers deserve safe work environment. I‚Äôm NC, sake example - school 79% staff report feeling unsafe campus covid risks 65% report either high risk living someone high risk. started getting vaccine access recently enough teachers fully vaccinated. seems like pretty minimal thing ask students continue wear mask. 

I‚Äôm also curious whether person enrollment would drop got rid mandate. may well students whose families comfortable risk level masks, would pull kids virtual mask mandate dropped. students shouldn‚Äôt decision forced people refusing something minimal wear tiny piece fabric. Money made massacre, money moved medicine. actually got vaccine ""card"" printer paper  don‚Äôt listen podcasts conspiracy nuts! observer like scientist observe make conclusion. don‚Äôt jump everyone it. read articles vaccine manufacturers government website say thing know latter worse. also say vaccine websites approved FDA passed medical emergency. Also sign waiver anything happens uncomfortable part. I‚Äôm sure downvoted - socioeconomic status factor ones career choice upward mobility. Many factors that‚Äôs one. 

Also intelligence singular measure, every measure IQ tests quite limited specific area. Thank Georgia! Lucky you, posted comment twice. lmao right People downvoting me, oh well. 

I seen newest numbers, but, 70% improvement. 

Natural infection, without vaccination, 60% protective agains S.African variant, based research. contrast, 9 months, convalescent sera mean sixfold reduction neutralizing titers, 40% samples lacked activity B.1.351.

source: 40% us infected original strain, 40% people risk. 

Interestingly, 1 dose Moderna Pfizer elicits strong enough response stop them, expected often strong enough stop SARS-COV-1. natural infection floowed vaccination, leads essentially 100% immunity. [mRNA vaccination boosys cross-variant...,Stamatos et. al., Science]

If, 42% population infected, 0.7√ó0.75=52.5% vaccinated, and
Vac+Infected= 100% protected
Infected = 60% protected
Vaccine = 81.3% protected, (2/3@90% moderna Pfizer + 1/3 @ 64% JnJ (S.Af. effectiveness))

Then number people immune 58.8%, good enough stop R0 ~2.43. short. good enough stop variants; persistant infection rate, i.e. wont herd immunity. maybe thousands day every state, some, nonetheless. Sweet  Flip coin. Whoever signs vaccine first, however decide can‚Äôt decide based race. misunderstand isn‚Äôt affirmative action in-laws zero interest getting vaccinated, point fuck ‚Äòem. 

Yup. Same. in-laws catch die, fuck 'em. hope kill anyone else, including grand daughter born living stupid reason.  stupid people getting together large groups,, social distancing, refusing wear masks. Stupid, stupid people. 
I live Michigan. love michigan, really dumb ass people really think folks going insulting? way... Remember 60k cases jaw dropping. Everybody signed waiver. legislated recourse. Yeah, we're unique situation since people *haven't* gotten vaccine yet community spread still significant (and increasing states). means difference ""95% safe"" ""100% safe"" actually significant. vaccines *are* good enough get us herd immunity (hopefully), difference matter less get closer. two students exact grades/extracurricular/etc, one black one white. choose black student based skin color affirmative action. vaccine. two people satisfy age requirement 16, one black one white. situations different? situation applicants meet requirement, grades school age vaccine. get pick based race. I've finished caring individuals get vaccinated refuse to. die, die. hope take anyone else them. Yeah, I'm extremely cautious comes CDC recommendations. got first shot already, I'm high risk full lockdown year 4 months now. Even full vaccination, going take hell long time even muster courage walk grocery store, let alone travel. still many 'what ifs' going forward stuff, makes health anxiety spike roof. Older people weaker immune systems general, though, vaccines don‚Äôt work well them. data working-age people relevant stopping pandemic. tearing unvaccinated. Get shots soon minimize coming fourth wave. Uk variant spreads faster affects younger ages qualify vaccination yet. Hopefully summer break slow people need aware kids vulnerable right now. Michigan's spike driven mostly kids. think point better safe sorry. I. sure arguing logic.

We've couped year. extra week caution certain safety really big issue stage?

Just wait two weeks second shot go getting back normal activities. smart move. can't believe there's entire country antivax assholes. dutch sons bitches. Glad enjoying! talk 5 months! Sane here! Going Thursday sister. We‚Äôre early twenties. 100 million people starting vaccines. past 150 million shots days ago. Plenty time fucked ass mutation. Knock wood. worry they're anti-vaxx lmao chicago? Lmfao Trump right? Covid go away Easter? scary variant? odd language inducing emotions all. Legitimately funny see France back 50k cases day population roughly 1/5th ours. Yikes. Hopefully superior vaccination rates lots previous infections prevent happening here.

I hope works European friends across pond. to, scientists way smarter developing vaccines long time, process get approved smarter people FDA extremely, extremely rigorous, would approved actual chance long term effects. literally anti-vaxxer believe otherwise lol sure people like pretending aren't. people zombie apocalypse look actual, working cure slowly fixing world, listen fringe podcast it'll turn cyborg decade decide somehow smarter rest world.  Yeah I'm sure different everybody.

For little pain, slowly grew point lift arm. two Tylenol, though, minor ache. Still tiny bit sore, able lift weights morning without problems. Jesus, almost third country gotten least vaccine dose, number rapidly increases per day. everyone still acting like things still urgent months ago? Even people catch it, longer demographics dying large numbers nearly extent, deaths stay way. drives mad, don‚Äôt know long term kids. Saying ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt get sick‚Äù right ridiculous short sighted mentality. going lung damage ten years? Arthritis? Autoimmune diseases? one knows. VA done fantastic job scheduling booking appts. single payer healthcare system fully electronic database schedule manage fast software allows. local VA exhausting supply every week I‚Äôve heard. 

Of things I‚Äôve received serving, two Pfizer vaccines appreciate most. two minutes fifteen minute waiting time started hurt lol. people keep saying even america trials (where variants werent widespread) 10-15% less effective mRNA vaccines. also evidence suggest going much weaker mutations compared mRNA vaccines. pass fast! body aches like I‚Äôve never experienced suddenly gone. Others know issues also issues pass rapidly. :) received vaccine arm two days ago. arm hurts, legs started feeling funny. legs hurt, muscles/joints feel slightly throbby. Especially knees gastronemeus muscle. Strange stuff. family serious margaritas guac!! impeccable timing! They‚Äôre wrong neglected mention Dutch numbers, thought obvious since that‚Äôs subject thread. 

I edited post, here‚Äôs source: It‚Äôs big deal bro tip iceberg. Yeah, I‚Äôm taking 2 days responsibilities following 2nd one. Trust know half it. cannot stand around people like me; I'm appreciative friends family very, different personality, conduct, interests myself. Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs two weeks! numbers wrong. number deaths 5 Norway alone least 9 Germany. Please source claims stop misinformation. still can't even make appointment mine.

I‚Äôm okay people making decision future generations people around them. Fuck mindset unwilling take goddamn vaccination. It‚Äôs like refusing wash yourself. using vacciness.. doubt ever know Russia's actual deathtoll within 50% real number. copy &amp; paste comments probably buried:

You compare risk catching covid dying it. Let‚Äôs take example simplified numbers:

Let‚Äôs say 20 deadly blood cloth cases 1 million young women. 1 50,000. Everyone get vaccine population 10 million get 200 dead.

Now covid. Maybe 1 1000 young woman die infected roughly 1 100 got infected far. means 1 100,000 die. population 10 million young 100 dead virus.

So using vaccine increase death rate young women even means stop virus safe many others higher risk dying covid .

The good thing is: give specific age group different vaccine use AZ people aren‚Äôt risk barely downsides. Everyone gets vaccine, covid stops, old people saved one sacrificed

Edit: note scenario assumes get covid control. don‚Äôt every young women get covid lifetime getting AZ vaccine actually decrease risk dying!

I hope example gives someone insight risk dying isn‚Äôt straightforward one might assume first I‚Äôve also mentioned least big cities, lifting mask mandate nothing tested positive yesterday, I'll locked room 14 days. time passes plausible I'll test negative really guarantee virus gone?  103 million Pfizer doses delivered states, 93 million Moderna doses. Really different. stop buying AZ alltogether.
Pfizer much promising. doses administered vaccination spot every one near last weeks they‚Äôve throw half total doses. next county last weekend used 550/2300 doses. 1750 got trashed issue first day eligible. Woke 4am next day able schedule immediately -- almost everywhere openings. Try waking middle night it. usually. There's never severe pandemic modern era ""which end"" option. 

1918 even know influenza eventually ran hosts. 1957, 1968, 2009 require social changes useful vaccine (2009's late). 

HIV never ended places know is, still *gigantic* social impact even drugs suppress it. 

Smallpox, polio yellow fever far terrifying ignore eradicated area. 

Historic severe, universal pandemics (e.g. plague, newly introduced smallpox) erased much preexisting social structure. Deaths typically lag infections 2-3 weeks, vaccinations certainly take worst could still painful spring. Actually it‚Äôs vaccines I‚Äôm referencing aren‚Äôt globally accessible. even deaths prior vaccine, places like India China don‚Äôt share regulatory bodies US. Access varies.

You‚Äôre quite attack mode. hope you‚Äôre feeling okay Yep, majority died UK men? I've defended AZ lot past, can't argue new evidence coming light now.

Either way, increasingly likely causal link AZ vaccine CVST young people. point, makes sense keep AZ vaccine 60s (where appear cause issues) use UK's vaccine portfolio younger people.

When time get vaccinated month two UK (and assuming AZ vaccine already limited 60s older, like rest Europe), ask doctor Pfizer Moderna vaccine. one offered AZ one, decline wait others become available. end doesn‚Äôt matter since US best people. EU hasn‚Äôt - that‚Äôs matters God hope right! 4th wave. Maybe slight bump nothing worthy concern. people catching young healthy part. High risk people mostly vaccinated. imagine good must feel vaccinated. I'm Canadian I'm really happy see US turning corner. quite go Ontario, unfortunately. 35, surprised can't get shot closer end year, delays we've having. happy parents wait long though. long year indeed. 60% death rate incorrect.

I would happily assume people died watching Ant &amp; Decs Saturday Night Takeaway complications vaccine. Europeans attacking AZ vaccine save face vaccinations debacle. Pretty sure exact opposite usually.. exactly? That‚Äôs high number all. nonsense. UK signed purchase agreement later. licensing agreement means nothing. take precautions, got vaccinated. already know damage EUs crusade AZ done, we‚Äôve witnessing year. types long term issues expect? vaccine ever shown complications years? worried about? Genuinely curious! Could use 5G though? mean, would really convenient People addicted fear porn. saw post earlier saying even 100% vaccinated would still need careful restrictions never reach herd immunity really feel like 5-10% insanely low? variant killing ‚Äòfaster‚Äô young people. increase 50%! Alarming males 0-34, study‚Äôs fatality rate baseline 3.1 100,000, B.1.1.7 variant 4.7 100,000

Why assuming article talking 0-34 thing - year pandemic sorts headlines narratives leaving less less trust Public Health information.

Here's thing. understanding what's going going typical bullshit rant feel validated. variant 60% likely kill people average, 50-65 demographic really pushes risk lot. would spend time European subreddit then. might well get ever lol. That's felt back Monday got it. feel sore following day. it'll pass 2nd/3rd day! Good luck! lol running joke paying give vaccine card that's valuable personal information worth,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúYou'll charge PayPal credit card, it'll untraceable - even know report.‚Äù [It's actually $150 mil drop $300-400mil used pay terrorists 5 years ago, cut expenses since donations dried Sounds like BS 

Likely extremely ignorant subject know next nothing conflict. pretty rudimentary Israelis (together Egypt) keep Palestinians incarcerated trapped poverty. 

More ignorance play, Palestinians West Bank higher median income opportunities Egyptians. 

Try laying propaganda read credible sources. Same.. Still woods yet. We‚Äôre close yet.. got first shot last Monday. able find location plenty appointments available. 2nd dose 27th! don‚Äôt get Pfizer seen medical super vaccine literally hang around fifteen minutes e jab make sure don‚Äôt go anaphylactic shock?

I‚Äôll anything NHS offers, COVID isn‚Äôt fun thing don‚Äôt fancy again. Wow. Snake oils salesman here. Talking horrible vaccine getting Pfizer. Real rich I‚Äôm fully vaccinated household. struggle notion really going anywhere social again. feel somewhat agoraphobic. It‚Äôs like double edge sword outside safer activities, asthma allergies hate outside Yes, mentioning Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus also coronavirus, well known precisely that, top extremely lethal. 

But coronavirus human beings dealing right that! 
I repeat: evidence showing anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination exacerbates, prolongs helps spread decease. fact, it‚Äôs safe say opposite true! Vaccines produce competent neutralizing antibodies, minor issue antibodies IgG ones abundant blood, much mucous membranes, hence don‚Äôt prevent contraction ideal vaccine would. 

But don‚Äôt need 100% neutralizing immunity order stop spread! 30% neutralization means 30% vaccinated people won‚Äôt infected all, mean remaining 70% dangerous unvaccinated people. accounting reduced viral load reduced time period infected person contagious proper vaccination. accounting reduced decease duration reduced volume affected tissues stay high provide virus best mutation playground. also don‚Äôt account measures taken. 30% 30 placebo. nothing tells work substantially different carnivores.

But know what‚Äôs style SARS-CoV-2? Recombinations. Weird animal-to-animal transmissions don‚Äôt know enough yet. lot mutations people prolonged COVID, might case animals too. 

So want prevent SARS-CoV-2 picking animal coronaviruses‚Äô traits, probably vaccinate pets point, provided humans don‚Äôt miss shots too. prevent virus entrenching pet animal populations. 30% cats never chance contract human coronavirus, would splendid. remaining 70% pretty much guaranteed won‚Äôt become silent carriers, that‚Äôs awesome too. means odds SARS-CoV-2 hooking FCoV screwing humanity low, that‚Äôs good thing. lol people charactatures agree you. Impending doom, calm storm... jazz. luckily, I've vaccinated get terribly sick die. Read sub rules. political comments wonder what's going wrong Chile vaccination, cases keep growing. guess measures almost non-existent? remember Israel cases really start go massively +50% one dose least 40% two doses hope Chile. UK way better similar vaccination rates, 6% people UK second dose I've following Canada's Fluwatch website past year. Rhinovirus impacted anti-covid dose given individual person, that's case. 

Data many people got least one dose God hearing European vaccinate snails pace makes want cry. Mid May might hit 20% here. fucking frustrating :( Huh interesting. Yeah, I'd trust continental European health system reports UK well. really boiling real life version trolley problem, stakes extending consequences losing public's trust willingness follow public health measures enacted help mitigate current wave we're experiencing.

It's kinda frustrating seeing people dismiss hand without actually taking time understand presents potential large problem dose given individual person, that's case. 

Data many people got least one dose I'm getting votes German vaccine approval board getting ahead plan, LOL. B117 causes 100% ICU admissions original virus, yes fact young people ending ICU. Yeah messed one up. But, chances getting really sick dying really really low. Link? aches mild fever felt like one. Lasted pretty much 24 hours slept 16 lol. Woke puddle sweat fine since fewer older people ICU yet ICU numbers gone up, means younger people ending ICU. Italy vaccination???? Everyone needs stop vaccinating 3 weeks flatten curve bloodclots Taking vaccine couple years probably pointless though, depending variants etc. Yes normally would good thing. Except amount people ICU doubled last 1 month timeframe. Enough enough. one year two prepare buy fair share vaccine prepare mass production instead fucked around waiting virus magically disappear. far know intention government maintain restrictions even vaccination campaign terminate; intolerable incostitutional! 100 days ask Americans wear masks first 100 days  I've wondering U.S. racing vaccinate population within next months parts world could take years, ever.

No one predict 2023, maybe covid less severe vaccines longer necessary. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Minnesota, massachusetts, new York, Michigan etc. starting surge. Michigan declined states, started surging like two weeks ago.

We're seeing younger people ICUs. critical condition hospitalizations spiked like crazy, every metric hospitalizations spiking now.

Pandemics predictable, given opportunity spread will. covid hospitalizing younger people now.

If sound impassioned comments work closed due outbreak week ago, (3 seperate cases unrelated span week) county stone's throw away breaking record. close friend died 3 weeks ago covid, 24 serious health conditions. know two people hospitalized. 30s. county highest vaccination rate state we're break records. We're already higher first wave. Bout exceed second.

The states testing far most, lot cases many times more, spiking. That's definitely alarming. difference within margin error, pretty much identical. source I‚Äôve seen references covid. I‚Äôm suspicious Unfortunately, can't transform astrazeneca vaccines pfzier. Ignoring risk them, shouldn't, still spread others vaccinated. People allowed spread Covid19 there's vaccine.  Wife went pregnancy pandemic lay ground rules contact, mask wearing, social distancing, etc. wife discussed rules agreed would make comfortable. bit awkward dictating family safety mental health important right now. makes feel safe, it‚Äôs stressful enough pregnant without worrying feeling guilty catching COVID.

Yes, felt like Mike Tyson punched might kithed it. fallacy.

Predictions tend worst-case scenarios warnings put governments encouraged people would follow guidelines so, thus reducing actual fatalities cases occurred.

The predictions ""wrong"", warning fuckwits might actually take notice try get line fight global pandemic. Similar quickly made covid vaccine, they‚Äôve got cancer vaccines sitting vials likely work. founder BioNTech said they‚Äôd humans within 2 years.

Mostly Oxford one get there's blurry line right misinformation, speculation, unfortunate lack information. mean accuse guys cult, pretty mad comments getting removed :) wait 2 weeks /s Germany, young women, risk dying AZ vaccine disproportionately high compared Covid.

No, isn‚Äôt. nasty, anti-vaxx lies get people killed. consider people choosing get vaccinated, reinfection rate variants (eg 30-70% people previously infected catch p.1 variant.) think herd immunity possible without vaccinating kids. comment basically opposite said. wouldn‚Äôt agree someone wanted stop driving car chance could kill old lady crossing street. second dose hit hard 24 hours in. thought gotten away lol. felt like shit whole day slight hangover feeling next.

Complete flu like symptoms nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. expected he'd sort reaction autoimmune disorder probably covid last year. started within first 12 hours.

That said, almost 2 days fine I'd say response unrelated illness might want go doctor anyway least IV antiemetic. Â§™Â•Ω‰∫ÜÔºÅ Heavy introvert checking in- lockdown great I've super happy go anywhere see anyone thank goodness. stoked since gotta still go see people :/ Oh definitely early declare victory US state. could happily stay home work, read, build stuff, watch movies, cook, work out, play video games, dnd roll20 least another ten years. Reasonable people disagree amount certainty around statement. think take another month two wearing masks halting superspreader events it‚Äôs justified. mean, first cold season I've gone without getting sick, actually planning wearing masks pandemic, least cold season about. see minor inconvenience major benefit.

I see vaccine passport major infringement though, already need ids literally anything. like scanning app different compared scan rewards app McDonalds Loblaws.

Also, I'm America, rollout vaccine super slow here. agree. I‚Äôm disheartened decision. child didn‚Äôt special needs would virtual rest year. Luckily fully vaccinated now!  don‚Äôt know deduced believed vaccination would spread extend disease.
I stated non-neutralising immunity acts selective pressure viral genome.
Out interest think bovine coronavirus disease needs many regular vaccines effective prophylaxis? 
And it‚Äôs amusing think confuse sterilising immunity sterilising antibodies stated 30% sterilisation equates 100% sterilising immunity ‚Äòreasons‚Äô. ignoring effects evolutionary pressure saying ‚Äòit‚Äôs bad vaccine, it‚Äôs good bro‚Äô. 
Even 5% population infection rate represents pool virus capable generating escape variants, let alone 70%. People seem forgetting well... one knows long term affects vaccine either. Millions people getting vaccine developed less year. know long-term affects Covid point vaccines. Vaccines typically take least decade develop, test manufacture. chickenpox vaccine FluMist, protects several strains influenza virus, took 28 years develop. took 15 years develop vaccine human papilloma virus, cause six kinds cancer. also took 15 years develop vaccine rotavirus, commonly causes severe, watery diarrhea. took Jonas Salk six years develop test first polio vaccine, starting isolation virus.

The Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccines, contrast, developed less year, one seems concerns. guess we'll see. Even bad bar band make mint right? really mess up. fired imo. messed many things room that. 

The chances dying low, correct. chances getting hospitalized also low.

But chances getting covid low, low. includes symptomatic covid. already many cases people getting pretty sick covid post vaccine. also likely happen J&amp;J vaccine less 80% efficacy rate moderate severe illness. people still get moderately ill worse, particularly J&amp;J. Uncommon, yes. rare. 

And new variants keep popping up, may happen more. anyone know brand disposable mask is? Looks tight fitting bottom ... false? happened someone know California. lived nursing home age 68 due disabling accident. got infected nursing home hospitalized days nursing home scheduled vaccinated. got say goodbye family took oxygen. Basically could avoided getting infected days, would vaccinated. back late January. much breathing /s Yeah relate this! I'm pretty big introvert say past year affected mental health all, really. Whereas extroverted friends really struggled. 

Messaging friends Facebook messages literally fills social needs. No, won't, happening daily life despite media may want keep pushing. Good timing shrink right? doubt it, happening grocery shopping daily things. You‚Äôve explained three times you‚Äôre dumbass who‚Äôs okay explicit racism month test prep testing kids missed much actual curriculum already. think also make good faith effort sanitize distance, doing. I'm America, still show ID purchase drinks, enter nightclub people living alone could days, weeks, maybe months without true human interaction touch. toll extremely devastating well. Yeah, you‚Äôre right. completely forgot lot things going recently. estimate perfect measurement Lowest count since last September apparently makes sense. 

Excuse anecdotal evidence‚Äî top this, I‚Äôve noticed people driven external forms validation suffered greatly. I‚Äôve lot high-achieving friends lose hope fall dark place, world put hold.

I‚Äôm trying say extroverts motivated external validation/ vise verse. Rather, trying say lot people found hard aren‚Äôt comfortable Covid.

That applies introverts extroverts, although extroverts tend get worse end stick. Excellent information! Although maybe I‚Äôd recommend replying second comment it‚Äôs easier find future/doesn‚Äôt get separated. reports zero hospitalizations deaths vaccinations. ID scanner systems (like ‚ÄúPatronScan‚Äù) bars get thrown one bar, also banned bar using system. 100% correct  Good luck man. hope situation improves soon there. Getting vaccine like telling virus go fuck itself. Soon country giving virus middle finger well got second yesterday! introvert 100% experience. felt extroverts though. Yes, democracy covidiots demonstrate 1000s people spread covid further. one likes stay home stupidity wins right probably real lockdown soon. Seeing lot comments introverts many extroverts... 

Extrovert here. past year sucked. work go home. live alone, hang dog, I'm overall bored lonely I've ever life. used go see music 1-2 times week, go get dinner friends, go shoot pool, etc. literally always out, living best life. happy I've ever pre-covid. moment I'm damn near sad/bored/down I've ever been.

Sigh. think unlikely hit 70% adults vaccinated. Still see fraction deaths, though. Cached data send appointments exist.   
The sites provide API bots get appointment data without bot crawl site way user would, creating contention available appointments. 

And assuming someone would write good considerate code likely folly. probability low. already know people know people got covid post vaccination. time goes people get symptomatic covid, even moderate severe illness post vaccination. uncommon, rare. 

And might think obvious CDC director meant. go listen people got symptomatic covid post vaccine hear shocked obviously thought actually 100% protected getting covid. Many people fact believe this. family members think totally clear. people ot serious enough health issues immunocompromised therefore affected even mild illnesses - made aware still chance could get covid. mean can't live lives, perhaps would wash hands little bit extra careful knew. Hypothetically past however many years, always possibility flu mutating becoming far dangerous. happened, would impose restrictions. applies COVID. unlikely, always possibility thus, like done flu, always need sample COVID track mutations. risk decrease significantly world vaccinated, always element risk, small risk, still risk. Wouldn‚Äôt impact northern states well? shit lol mom got first shot (Sputnik V). However, says shot painful, felt ‚Äúthe liquid entering‚Äù. anyone know that‚Äôs normal concerned? Thank you. live next regional hospital almost nonstop choppers bringing people in.... think sentiment everyone lie anyway it‚Äôll faked. it‚Äôll easy fake bother. hear people faking cards already too.

‚ÄúClear‚Äù ‚Äúhealth pass‚Äù thing I‚Äôve seen places use already.... it‚Äôs self reported, what‚Äôs point? R number work? rates falling much faster week two weeks R number gone up? elderly mom Chattanooga problem getting vaccine, trouble getting take it. 81 lives herself. don‚Äôt know data this, others might, highly doubt would allow double up. You‚Äôll cave. Eventually excluded way much you‚Äôll get tired martyring principle. much data potential long term effects covid children? I'm excited get vaccinated children 3 want really careful sakes still get vaccinated. YA SAY That's lot old people, essential workers, people existing conditions  Maybe ambivert ? would think even introverts would dislike lack international travel guess not. RemindMe! 1 month share good examples ""common sense"" things proven false? Interestingly, me, least, extra week might actually reason get Moderna. (I got Pfizer. offered me). Even four weeks fast side second shot - second shots usually show biggest impact come couple months. 

I doubt extra week makes much difference might slightly closer optimal timing. forced wear seatbelt, it‚Äôs also infringement. point I‚Äôm making things minor infringements major benefits.

A vaccine passport major infringement minor benefit time implemented.

Would comfortable requiring mask use indefinitely? save lives even COVID lowering virus transmission. answer no, understand sliding scale infringement:benefit ratio. society decide scale land. many others feel vaccine passport lands ‚Äúnot worth it‚Äù side scale. disagree, that‚Äôs fine I‚Äôve laid original comment believe won‚Äôt worth it. Boo, team Moderna way, vaccine way better vaccine one got False in, water wet. That‚Äôs American. countries don‚Äôt show ID enter bar. see giving personal opinion. see expert field saying likely case given expertise. 

And again, I'm solely referring Fauci. fucking people expect people want get vaccine keep saying #stayathome like mid 2020, we're going situation brazil. 

Even CDC got done saying thatbvaccinated people go enjoy life. Less likely get sick spread it. completely bulletproof So...instead showing vaccine passport...you're going deny things missed past year? Nobody said anything. 

But made aware risks. 

If someone told 100% chance would never get car accident went drive....that would false. could lead people wear seatbelts take precautions. thing here. important front people allowing resume normal lives, give accurate information. Great. medical personnel distribute them. probably better material /r/AskDocs, friend. don‚Äôt MDs here. hope feel better! No, incorrect reading science, probably lasts longer, haven‚Äôt tested past 6 months yet likely combination variants relatively low amount immunity earlier waves. Michigan relatively little since first wave first wave mostly hit detroit March 2020. Plus possible waning antibodies long he‚Äôs properly cacheing data, reduction queries. Exactly. people arguing pointed out. 

It HUGE problem someone says 100% clear. people get covid (even symptomatic moderate cases severe illness) shocked got vaccinated. 

People given proper information make decisions themselves. may people serious health problems would take additional precautions knew 100% clear type illness getting vaccinated. Absolutely not. first dose alone around 80% effective, every single one 100 million people given antibodies protect themselves. 

How clickbait all? difference 0 1 dose FAR FAR greater difference 1 2 everyone 60. 
Mine's still going through. serious type blood clots often deadly. watching NBA last night thinking many tests must done since players tested constantly sports. know tests reported? count state done in? Hey there‚Äôs fire. It‚Äôs massive one. big fire truck sprayer definitely put fire 20 minutes getting here. Let‚Äôs take firefighting gear take break til shows - maybe eat sandwich run errand.

Said firefighter ever.

They need replan 60+ population single dose goes waste Scotland Again, blood clots cerebral vein trombosis, serious often deadly. sure poster said infection rate. needs controlled against, needs controlled (potential) partial escape variant(s). would suggest getting people right thing?

I stop adamant FDA approves AZ. Holy shit, that's bad. Best luck you. It‚Äôs human behaviour This. anti-vaxxers' pleading become meaningless countries like Israel UK start going back normal. really hypocrisy introverts happy getting one year thousands need tend social needs extroverted people lives. 

Except world, that's even true. shut two weeks live. still go work socialize customers coworkers entire time. Bars open wear mask. I've able avoid family commitments often that's amazing. Saying fully vaccinated people ‚Äúeasily kill people‚Äù participating normal activities definitely fear-mongering. Myers Briggs test flipping back forth every year Introvert adapting much extroverted position/office. tough agree Introverts setup better pandemic lockdown. enjoy office times quickly realize productivity days work cube farm. Hope strike balance coming months us slowly return back office WFH also allowed. Yeah... guessing interview people families home. never time I'm truly alone Nate good takes Covid feel like  feel like we've got years' worth evidence outdoor spread seems extraordinarily rare outdoor masking probably overkill except exceptional circumstances (ie: tightly packed crowd moving hours tested positive coughing/sneezing) Indoor sports allowing 100 spectators. Speed needs doubles next month think one good things that's going come nightmare renewed appreciation privilege housed, fed, safe able normal human things. 

It's gonna amazing introducing new grandkid, congrats ! normalcy plug rise, India needs administer 4/5 million new first doses everyday means double next month
A tough task option left. 

Hopefully vaccine candidates get approval, Sputnik maybe JJ Zycov gte soon UK person here. give perspective, vaccine yellow fever:

\- causes severe allergic reaction 1 55,000 people

\- causes severe neurological reaction 1 125,000 people

\- causes severe illness organ failure (and deaths) 1 250,000 people 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet take it, nonetheless. wish treatment that's 100% safe everyone. Yeah, outdoor masks make whole lot sense yourself. Large gatherings beach however concerning. sub still acting like that. asked question well debunked line bullshit Fauci, masks 1918 that‚Äôs easily answered via Google. complaint bitchute reinforcing impression question gave people. Might want wear mask case, yeah fine. lie. Serious side effects even occur healthy young individuals, simply lower rate occurrence. going straight accusing white people stealing shots black people? Okay world live guess pharmacist scheduled every second shot someone showed first. Alabama. Thank words motivation!! know end day, I'm right thing :) Same.

Also, feeling justification saying someone every gave introverts hard time saying Bad symptoms common first dose you‚Äôve Covid before. might asymptomatic case noticed, enough make immune system recognize vaccine. end getting banned anyway sweep Trump2, really worth pursuing? 

Who pursuing this? mostly private companies. government it. think they‚Äôre wave locked recently. doubt many exposed virus like states have. IMO lockdowns delay inevitable spread think they‚Äôre stupid decision. People US familiar vaccination programme forgetting something, though. vaccinated young people Pfeizer, older AZ. started 100,90,80 etc year olds.. opened 50s far I'm aware. data would necessarily existed extent EU has. EU vaccinated young people AZ beginning. noticed personally. also appreciated *did * go (shopping, appointments, etc..) everyone typically level anxiousness around found comforting. Seldom anyone overtly obnoxious (that encountered fortunately), every public space avoided allowing crowds. excuse miss tiring social events cancelled. mean, that's fair, again: feel weather, simply apologizing saying chance get vaccinated took fully make that.

Side effects completely random though. got shot said something like 1/3 people significant effects first shot. arm incredibly sore - think they'd count significant, would affected interview. another friend really mild case COVID last fall severe flu symptoms days. Saving shitton time money commuting?

That's really unlucky, must tiny % still caught developed symptomatic covid, hopefully vaccine still enough prevent anything serious... idiots great parents yet stillchoose idiots Congrats enrollment thanks taking one team. make sure get past headlines reading.  best three months life last year lockdown. basically paid Spring Break me. ate healthier cooking instead making sandwiches lunch time workout (gained interest running). mention video games played. like early taste retirement me. Yep 100% well. might unpopular opinion think outdoors mask mandates pretty outdated regarding COVID mitigation, especially outdoors keep distance. Europe focused big part strategy outdoors masking work because, know, almost impossible impossible get COVID outdoors keep decent distance. sizeable percentage population gets vaccinated think ridiculous keep wearing masks outside, especially summer people cough, sneeze, etc less. 

It's probably gonna last measure eliminated first. know ""easiest"" one follow cause reality affect people's lives massively think would give citizens much needed sense normalcy 70% herd immunity thresold reached, especially countries 70% expected mid late September even worse, countries expect reach percentage mid 2022 fair concerned certainly think better err side caution throw COVID protocols window people vaccinated. said, seen anything would suggest new variants bad enough push us past peak January. Considering much warmer now, 50+% population probably immune/soon immune, people immune ones vulnerable disease, I'd utterly shocked came close peak levels COVID deaths (4480 Jan 12 per Worldometers, 7DMA peaking 3459 Jan 17). took 3 hours arm hurt. side effect first Pfizer dose. peaked 16 hours injection woke next morning gone arm fine. never lost motion hurt full reach.

If prone strong reactions I'd avoid never strong immediate reaction probably fine hours even mild side effects. healthy immune system take care yourself, nothing worry about. born weak immune systems concern. Extravert here, much attest this. However, I‚Äôve adapted become introverted since pandemic started; don‚Äôt mind peaceful afternoon spent reading learning something alone. Cries extrovert Good know, surprised! told ppl major symptoms 1st shot definitelywasnt expecting feeling like got hit train. Idk ppl voting question :/ thought thats point discussion post for, oh well! side effects worse 2nd time?  think provides enough certainty originate UK, least enough say ""the 'UK' variant clearly originate UK"". According this, 90% two weeks first dose, even 70% one week first love New York Times can‚Äôt grasp say things like ‚ÄúThese days, signs hope offset peril.‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem like true characterization state affairs all. Outdoors good. Indoors bad! COVID terrible, without doubt. Everything closed sucks (but makes sense!), tragedy certainly lost me.

But god love expected go every time something happens. Every holiday, every appointment...it much. Due illnesses I'm shut enjoys going terms quite bit scheduling time prepare advance.

I finally left loaf around house way nature intended I'm dragged unless want doctors appointment quite literally requires physical contact...and glorious. I'm free.  knew someone did. clearly legal drinking age (maybe 50s 60s), bar ""card all"" policy lost shit waitress requiring see ID serve drink.

Some people just... sigh. Partaaaay!

SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS! could get pot say going approve AZ US, could send 30 million doses country needs them. Instead we're going wait another month that. suburbs Philly inner city. Philly distribution system. already roadmap laid restrictions released. People know long vaccine uptake consistent, we'll basically back normal end June. Boris saying line roadmap. already date indoor meetups allowed.  Poor people inner cities can't really drive hour. angry confrontational, ""no one gives fuck Canada"", ""good luck dwindling vaccine rollout"". Right math checks out...

Ultimately agree aspect concern data security. think difference is, anyone take info picture card that's posted, vs hacking required get database. Although said, databases get hacked time. see point.

I even think systems even put place, long. Tell bosses/employers there. really worried that. planned poorly going online last fall they're over-preparing now, actual odds near zero. vaccines fully approved, require students employees zero covid. Fired May. Best year life aside skin problems excessive washing. Lost 25+ lbs eating fast food lunch every day nights. Got hobbies worked on. Figured mental wellbeing concerns. fortunate, actually got money *added* savings home cooking cancelled plans.

I feel bad suffered year. donated could, can't deny much better year. I'm extrovert shoulder surgery 2 weeks lockdowns. depressed hard. Drug addiction, weight gain, ruined relationships, developed poor habits I'm still struggling change... 2020 worst year life. started relationship late 2019 probably saved falling further. even sucked give partner best version myself. I'm lucky amazing I'm working bring relationship fuck 2020. got me. read article, work place giving shots. Yeah, unfortunately asshole politicians love leverage every tiny little thing can. 

I don‚Äôt remember consequential shit ever repealed aside selective tax cuts rich poor back forth pubs Dems There‚Äôs 74m kids US eligible vaxes yet. numbers off. guess end April won‚Äôt able give away. bet end 70% adults vaccinated. works, wished better system overall. Ideally sort wait list invite people waves there's enough appointments available guaranteeing find availability called.

I got appointment tomorrow saw somewhere CVS adds new appointments midnight checking right midnight worked lot availability, feel much like scavenger's hunt.

Then again, probably get better weeks waiting would likely worked too, hard year this. bit topic, ""the economy"" open now? we'd like able stop wearing masks.

We're gonna look like Israel soon, unless anti-vax propaganda stops it: Lol. actually meant tobacco, yeah... either one works. concept. know people don‚Äôt like give identifying personal details Reddit. delete comments days get it. 

I read article O+ blood type found fascinating. negative RH factor looking year studies done viruses rh- blood types. far, nothing. 

I‚Äôm going ramble bit - sorry... I‚Äôm interested rh thing lot tests done Rhesus monkeys. Rh- folks don‚Äôt Rhesus gene, I‚Äôm really interested finding tests accurate rh- blood types. I'm genuinely curious (and meant attack) possibly due jealous, FOMO? annoy you/ care trips? underestimate introverts. I'm way, hell, used go clubbing pretty often.

I hate people think I'm introverted means want stay home time. still recommends wearing masks vaccination, can‚Äôt speak remarks alternate strains covid, views expressed contradicted consensus scientific community? I‚Äôm unaware advice running counter rest scientific community. Generally speaking he‚Äôs cautious making public statements coronavirus. useless study ever one reddit actually knows means introvert extravert. Carl Jung coined terms, defined two different ways people unhealthy. Ideally introvert extravert. work towards middle. One well designed bot potentially put less load site users serves. YAAAAAYAAAAH!!!!!! even want go outside unless least 50 F. that's something active. comfortable sitting still eating drinks going need least 65F. political strife. I‚Äôm us vs. people saying ‚Äúbaaaaaaa‚Äù argument.

This part isn‚Äôt going end, politicians find something else latch onto order keep people divided. Fools going back normal life enjoy, fucking Christ Reddit lol Who‚Äôs locked inside forever? Hardly businesses closed. Ok, going sound weird, found extrovert immunosuppressed vaccine may provide immunity. don‚Äôt know. effects plenty people vaccine it‚Äôs effects limited non-existent. 10 Covid deaths reported today. 10.

Without ~19m AZ vaccines given would likely another 5-10k deaths still horrific 200-400 day. 

Luckily medical board dumb enough hinder vaccination scheme saved thousands lives continue save thousands lives. nations wish fine, hope plenty ventilators ready. mother showed symptoms COVID 10 days ago didn‚Äôt get tested week after, came back positive two days ago. I‚Äôm scared even get room without face mask, glasses face shield. overdoing it? Every government lies 

Not every PM made living inventing lies EU. highest volume transmission typically occurs presymtomatic browsed story i'm sure details, saw general thing cause things regenerate much chemical/hormone signal tells body grow teeth blocked using different chemical/hormone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Effectively mRNA technology would make easier send cases suppress hormonal chemical signals body already has, get body things would normally capable (and also hormones generated would effect whole body, doubtful could targeted specific area). know suspect reason mice able regrow teeth mammals lose milk teeth, already existing chemical/hormonal switch controls that. People making stuff home selling online.  Never better time this, engineer might come easy you.  also continue work toward longer term goal making leather gloves belts pay bills.  sayin.  Good luck getting office life. let doctor know allergies take blood pressure? lol. incredible people still act like long covid thing. Even risk like 2% that's still easily enough make vaccine no-brainer. wthr article say anything virus. goes say shuts mechanism creates symptoms disease though nothing virus.

The article suggests RNA vaccines used things outside viral infections. Well roadmaps get extended indefinitely people sick ignore them. Many people already beyond whatever government says, rightfully so. one speak publicly knows much EU August 2020 purchase order went Oxford Biomedica Cobra - initial agreement stated ‚ÄúThe European Commission made 336 million euro ($396 million) downpayment British drug maker AstraZeneca (AZN.L) secure least 300 million doses potential COVID-19 vaccine, spokesman said Thursday. deal covers development, liability costs faced vaccine maker‚Äù - initial investment also reduced cost done order negotiate reduction price per dose paid member states 2.90 per dose 1.12 per dose , saving hundreds millions - despite fact commission far paid 2/3rds 336 mill.


Remember also ‚ÄúBoth Halix IDT Biologika originally intended used U.K. supply chain,‚Äù - hence extensive investment UK gov UK tax payer money. Now; insistence UVD, Halix instead producing 0 doses UK stockpile distributed throughout EU- occurred acceptance British gov Man many things say office? many actually happened.  Social media takes effort knowledge. Neither has. also takes money, something lacks. contractor get upfront payment point deserves happens ultimately defaults. Lol ""baaaaaaaa"", accurate indeed. doubt part change though Agreed. 2 kids home 3 &amp; 6. soooo hard get work done, really rough first months. something snapped, like...duh.. lovr work night, work 3am, sleep in? BAM. Problem solved. adjust back months... Yay thing misleading ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù statistics hurt UK‚Äôs credibility damage AstraZeneca‚Äôs reputation.

They solution that: changed vaccine name AstraZeneca Vaxzevria

Not sure going change UK's name /s I‚Äôd say requirements much stricter lifetime pandemic may peak likely doses administered per day start go end April. Demand become HUGE problem many states mid-April, hard believe. Although happier short term, think lot introverts going suffer long term. Many fallen asocial hole, increased social anxieties due lack exposure, that's hard climb of. extrovert (with history moderate mental illness) went deep depression, put meds, bad reaction them, full blown mental breakdown (of vaguely remember. parents almost checked psyche ward one point tho). improving ton since spring hit, got meds, got vaccinated honestly shit still sucks reasons neither us idea it. Stop pathetic conspiracy theories. Yeah agree context Israeli number incorrect Bc would probably &lt;= 50% nice actually think that. people get wound holidays might impacted pathetic. you‚Äôre job allowed it, Working home lot peaceful productive too. worries, think we're learning lot odds risks various things result this. scary reading news social media, long fact check much possible we're informed make decisions based that. really get young people considering risk dying instead risk long covid. Seems much pertinent. Well, definitely agree that.

As introvert, pandemic had... positive negative effects me. I've always fan working home tends productive, I'm taking full advantage situation right now. 

It gave time family, gave time hobbies, I'm forced meetings emails, unnecessary social interactions draining, etc.

I'm also going admit kind enjoyed seeing extroverts struggle things badly, fast. understand need interactions recharge battery, much like need quiet time. god, handle poorly. 

It seems lot extroverts complete inability entertain without outside stimulation. completely foreign thing me, way hobbies interests time.

We usually live extroverts world. absolutely love get spend time introverts world while. hope it'll make understand difficult us live theirs, struggle adapt ours.

I five years easily. Children teens really matter tbh. catch virus rarely severe. want talk people, want talk people found lack forced small talk interactions colleagues assorted random people care really relaxing. found lot energy force interact everyone met miss closeness physical contact people really, genuinely close to. question is, experience make extroverts aware introverts feel normal circumstances not?

Its really common shit introverts wanting certain things entire thing kicked off, continue not?  dont live certain countries Europe, certainly case Czech Republic. recent example: gotten hard lockdown since start march told endure 3 weeks would get lifted. course never happened still lockdown least another 10 days. isnt mind boggling all. knows Republicans like anyone acts spiteful. They're party cheering assholes. That's it.  Nothing deeper needs assessed them. dictate news isn't? People get names paper time misdemeanors petty offenses. Nobody cares. People find story interesting midst pandemic claimed 500k American lives. dude went Happiest Place Earth acted like child getting temperature taken...even though requirement made clear visiting staying Disney properties. compound bad judgement, starts pulling ""I important"" card.

I think so. UK worst corona outbreak Europe due failed corona response. exactly UK government desperate vaccine, vaccine, cover mismanagement. 

Portugal reduced infections deaths UK even though got 1/5 vaccine doses UK has. let guess. receive text message email regarding COVID-19 vaccine survey promising prize cash upon completion, click link. messages often state need pay shipping handling receive aforementioned prize. worry caused lack sleep. body going thing anyway. never invited parties want go, no? Very, common. mom vaccinated, spread jam bread morning. Nobody likes lockdowns they‚Äôre purpose. spent much time sub, you‚Äôd know purpose is. Thats extroverts work. Like force introverts parties rag miserable situation. 


""I'm X therefore also!"" sounds like real michael scott situation wouldn‚Äôt count that. I‚Äôm guessing like flu vaccines, highly highly encouraged, required homes going stores unstressful daughter.

Cool username üòâ It‚Äôs statistics. Almost studies proving transmission unlikely. doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs possible. could get vaccine someone could cough mouth could cough unvaccinated person giving disease.

you see movie? Fixed yet top comment damn thread ‚Äúlol‚Äù. happened place? Agreed.  Yeah thats true too.

But also true vaccines lot less, less severe, side effects. theyre new star signs people spout bullshit lol ex demonstrated pretty well past year. actually comprehended English language know already answered question. I'm sorry school failed you. Must turned class traitor going management. could another year lockdown. I'm little disappointed things 'returning normal.' Yes, I'm introvert. Well, also introvert think also depends WFH done.

Because even office, often really interact people lot. Like, course talked people sometimes bit, often days basically ""hi"" ""bye"".

When basically people including WFH, people still office usual stuff regular meetings always had. now, people WFH, introduced daily meeting talk ""anything"" already feel even gets annoying. Like, currently talking people WAY office.

Of course, less commuting silence still plus WFH. extrapolated blood donors offered free covid test donating 

""All experts spoke with¬†The Scientist¬†agree main limitation new study blood bank donors representative total population. researchers adjusted demographic skew sample comparing population census, approach far perfect.

So individuals using way get tested tests short supply. there's international fans year,  believe evidence prove AZ blood clotting problem exist elderly. EU countries used AZ young people insufficient data elderly trials. start using AZ elderly EU, I'm pretty sure blood clotting cases too.  Kinda depends kids school alone time kids home Family time. There‚Äôs also lot people call introverted aren‚Äôt actually introverted socially anxious. winter like spiraling point bruh I'm feeling attacked, asking way discrimination let people work home want to? seeing answer that. Ohhh evil big government. Imagine someday forced even get license drive car. Oh tyranny. :/ Yeah every adult male met last 8 years cared literally nothing work sports I've never happier. commute. sleep. spend time wife kid, even eat meals together. 

I never want go back. really think need find better term vaccine passports. that's well good. support world extroverts exclude introverts promotions upward mobility. introverted handle pandemic less good extroverted wife. realized important 'limited' social life me.

 imagine generally extroverts suffer more, definitely introverts suffer well. Well, like oxygen masks drop airplanes. help help child/invalid I'll wait watch. may smart, virus something can't predicted. sit watch. Lol, shit ridiculous.

At point, hopefully end year, personal choice risk catching thing not, masks wont requirement. nah, happened friend too. pretty sure able claim unemployment time off. making $900 per week lol downvoting questions? offense, consider reading news places besides US, lest deemed another ignorant American. ;)

There's fourth wave potentially starting major European countries (Germany, France, etc.) US one farthest ahead rate vaccination, especially considering people fully vaccinated. countries well, although EU encountering AstraZeneca political issues, supply issues, distribution issues, recently concerns potential side effects, causing delays there. wealthy countries (e.g. Switzerland, Canada) seem obstacles depending countries produce vaccines issues ramping local distribution caused local political inefficiencies.

Even though US benefits large production capacities export ban (which generally prevented approved vaccines exported countries), done nearly everything related vaccinations remarkably well, things considered. really know people physically unable get vaccines? mean sarcastically I'm genuinely surprised information available CDC I‚Äôm UK, I‚Äôm 44 got invitation first vaccination next week. mother 70 she‚Äôs shots. Yes. I‚Äôm sorry. Even celebrate return normalcy vaccine may give us, hope remember never ‚Äúnormal‚Äù lost someone left chronic condition virus. I‚Äôm keeping dad thoughts today. first time Fauci wrong. Paid sick leave probably available everyone either. two kids university state open 16 vaccines. One RA/CA gother first dose campus (second scheduled) child got JandJ one shot done campus. fortunate. Concert promoter - correct. Even 50% capacity, things rough. need full capacity shows tours start back venues actually make money tot sustain expenses. Yep, exactly did.

Way bury facts ... Yes. Loser republicans buying fake vaccinated, hurt people. 1.6% Canadians fully vaxxed. 

The states usually see people received first one. second one delayed til July lot people. company closed office work home!

It tiny office huge corporation, asked us wanted keep not. said no. I'm worried outsourcing I'm pretty critical role, plus requires security clearance periodically go facilities classified work. Pfffffffttttt So, I've isolating while. first shot great, got exactly week ago. However I'm worried I've isolated I'm going susceptible sorts things while. plan exposing world incrementally anyway. higher percentage get better. 

Sure, 80% sounds great. still means 20% people definitely going bad time. I've got isolation routine works, jump gun? really not. every headline clickbait right now, know original SARS-CoV-2 variant virus right? contained, day, someone get infected, mutate virus body pass others. Every time happens, becomes likely vaccines become good water protecting it. It‚Äôs shame republicans deeply enslaved television channel understand things like this. sit, wife got second shot. 3 kids yet vaccinated able yet, safe, hyper-aware cannot simply start going without risking carriers infecting children worked hard stay safe. 

So now, continuing wear masks social distance much possible.

We also decided even wearing masks sick sickness seasons avoid getting sick. 

It makes sense. Makes sense me. Thanks, Satan. kicking ass like mine? 60% white make republicans say won‚Äôt get vaccine. We‚Äôre hosed unless relent. ya go 
""Coronavirus vaccines finally reaching poor countries, can‚Äôt cover cost administering vaccines [begun trickle world‚Äôs poorest nations, large part thanks Covax, World Health Organization-backed initiative distribute vaccine doses equitably.

That rough five-year patch eventually went therapist lot work-life problems anyway, one things got work agree upon maximum 15 trips year goal keep month, notice trips (because literally kept suitcase packed trunk they'd sometimes decide needed somewhere next day I'd go straight airport). ten years they've kept promise every year -- past year trips because, well, pandemic.

My ideal travel schedule would probably half dozen trips year. 15 trip annually limit (and usually like 10 12) works too. I'll probably okay traveling get groove again, seems weird idea I've hardly left house except grocery shopping visiting mom past year. I've forgotten pack trip! Yeah, think people fully vaccinated late May June. got first dose ""fully vaccinated"" May 19th. There's lot really exciting new studies though, showing even first dose gives 80% immunity two weeks, which, even though enough warrant lifting mask mandates, enough start slowing virus sooner expected. Haha awesome man. Got first moderna today well. Slightly sore arm pretty much side effects I'd get vaccine. believe 90%, still quite good yesterday think. One shot 80%. There's unfortunately whole sub them, roleplay like anti vaxxers lol. Super bizarre. I‚Äôm sorry Im familiar scientific research related particular scenario :(

I interested myself, I'll getting two doses regular old Pfizer. get herd immunity either. would think otherwise? getting vaccinated April 8, takes like two weeks right? 
Atleast mom in-laws vaccinated fully. Fauci initially wrong everything. unlikely spread do.

The CDC says there's currently little research fully establish that, even early results promising. Every wave headlines virus killing younger. Also good point specific scenario. Cool, kids 16 can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet? Nobody gets one you, sly dog. That's exactly says. interpretation longer test covid go internationally unless go another country requires test. Also domestic travel, expectation getting tested go travel come back. still saying travel essential still suggesting avoiding crowds etc. clear exactly means general interpretation would things like crowded bars clubs perhaps highly crowded restaurants etc everything else fair game. Probably revised another week two zero science backs statement. Please stop. think need lot data able answer correctly.

I'd guess longer interval doses may help. I'd also guess smaller first dose may better. literally lied masks effective general public too! Grats getting done. feeling? expect much symptoms first shot arm little sore- nothing expect vaccine. America: hold beer! Oh duh. Thanks. Agree 100% anyone says otherwise ignorant self-entitled. Thank considerate lives. Right I‚Äôm speaking specifically comment. 

The idea fear variants, even aren‚Äôt vaccine resistant, increase vaccine uptake counterintuitive today‚Äôs world. 

It‚Äôs similar mask thing. 

I‚Äôm saying place making value judgement. I‚Äôm telling people receive negatively. Disregard, earlier comment wrong thread Someone months back posted really interesting comment listing dozen things never would occurred me. vaccine bottle means takes longer freeze, apparently speed matters. Thawing speed also matters, impacts dilution need ensure vaccine still evenly mixed dilutant. 

I‚Äôm explaining terribly bottom line turns lot complex reconstituting frozen orange juice! One shot offers significant protection. Regardless, really doesn‚Äôt matter. Deaths/hospitalizations/infections free fall then. thought could give us bad news I'm getting pretty fucking sick her. doesnt take decades virus mutate....
We're already dealing multiple variants Come on, obvious CDC director meant. know technically right, intent purposes probability low enough treated such. Vermont adopts racist law law violates 14th amendment civil rights act 1964. not? people traveling across states countries like wasn‚Äôt pandemic?  No. people got two doses. 

100M doses administered. 

Now 100M received least one. people received 2 doses. 

It took min figure one dose though. get fully vaxxed another ~4 weeks, think June :) can‚Äôt coronavirus waves ska, it‚Äôs fact.  logic drive anywhere, since could die car accident given drive. Nothing 100%. quote podcast listen to, messaging ""COVID shots equals body shots"". Yea, number reasons. I‚Äôve Covid developed level natural immunity, first vaccine dose yesterday, parents considered fully vaccinated Tuesday. 

We still need get wife appointment (she hasn‚Äôt able get one)and in-laws zero interest getting vaccinated, point fuck ‚Äòem. 

In short, barring actual variant really care about, I‚Äôm done. He'll say something different next week. FYI they‚Äôre looking potentially vaccinating high school middle school students fall rest children early next year. Shows well following data, ignorant swine Title album: Going Goth days ago, NY marked 20,000 cases single day. That‚Äôs we‚Äôve ever gotten, even initial explosion back March-May 2020. Idk exactly New York right now, it‚Äôs concerning. latest figure I've seen Americans plan get gotten it. census site 18+ closer 78%. that's ~53% coverage. Israel started plummeting ~46% partial 56% full coverage despite variants, top US likely significantly natural immunity Israel. Texas+Florida: Hold beers.

But debris viruses thier arsenal proteins left infection could triggering prolong inflamed response.

During course infection virus inhibit immune response. may robust response. 

When vaccinate, vaccine producing immune suppression actual virus vaccine often better future protection.

I've fully vaccinated since February I'm still taking every precaution. mean say another thread missed going dates giving hugs. man it‚Äôs choice ü§ù Love Bill Nye! actually got see person younger 90's little tour. Lmao, probably optimistic person overwatch entire time. anyone working background PR reporting, would‚Äôve asked least another month two careful public health policies. Tens thousands people die every year measles, even high levels vaccinations. Also Cuomo: Come Ladies. ...you‚Äôre telling me, didn‚Äôt see shadow? I'm sure Walensky. 4th surge? mean, already live family. else would really need Also, high risk areas (major cities) getting priority. LA San Fransisco bunch federal programs targeting risk populations realize people vaccinated are, part, people risk severe complications virus right?

Even cases rise December January, highly highly doubt, hospitalizations deaths far lower assuming vaccines effective variants we‚Äôve led believe. Isn‚Äôt point, though?  we‚Äôve seen, effective measures early, suppressive interventions, centuries. Vaccination works worldwide scale, given highly globalized economy loose border controls. can‚Äôt stop mutation selective pressure escape vaccines national level. could potentially vaccinate way end pandemic, would require breaking pharma stranglehold vaccine IP, US seems unwilling do. It‚Äôs likely countries like US force periodic mass death ‚Äúcost business‚Äù everyone, they‚Äôve done past year. Holiday weekend weddings....damn people Didn‚Äôt say masks don‚Äôt help record...? 5 GANG REPRESENT RemindMe! 14 hours 

Let‚Äôs compare notes lol certain point take risk assessment move life.

Yes, time, must clear-minded exactly we're risking. skydiving something affects ourselves. actions right risk *other* people's lives.

You're right low probability. low enough, part equation--community spread--is still rampant, actually increasing parts US? Remember, almost thousand Americans still died *just yesterday*: replied person pandemic day get second dose.

Scheduled second dose, too. Productive day gonna refuse see anyone rest life man?  Congratulations!! haven‚Äôt seen mine since 12th March 2020 either, I‚Äôll seeing Mother‚Äôs Day! 

I hope y‚Äôall wonderful reunion :) Okay thanks - one place signed waitlist weeks ago said 6pm time. Good know! Must nice! Canada... :( yes, is.. specifically COVID sure mad didn‚Äôt buy ding dung fart filtering undies suppose depends individual. see lot difference indoor bars/restaurants performances terms perceived dangers. course, things basically considered unsafe last year. belief certain amount trepidation around things, even among vaxxed people. One friend mine says he'll never put kind crowded situation needlessly again; doubt he'll feel way forever, that's feels moment.

Vaccine passports eventually become obsolete--after certain point, one care anymore. think they're going helpful we're waiting reach point. Yes! mRNA vaccines phase 3 trials showed high 80% efficacy first dose around 94 second. since isn‚Äôt data showing lasting immunity one dose, it‚Äôs second one important! 

I‚Äôm going donate blood next week includes free antibody test, I‚Äôm hoping detectable then! Great efficiency. Bad forgery. idea plan people 16? Young children? Toddlers? know it‚Äôs safe yet? know vaccines work apparently. Would mask really keep fun? thin piece uncomfortable fabric really obstructive? agree everything says, think main issue basically saying 100% not. Even said fully vaccinated probably 75%-95% safe getting virus. Nothing 100%. Yeah call women, nah? Well also aren‚Äôt one worlds largest nations, even you‚Äôre making argument per capita perspective means we‚Äôve got natural immunity US. Dang. got moderna believe UK next shot 4 weeks scheduled right first one. Even pfizer 3 weeks J&amp;J one shot. vaccine requires 3 month wait? supply issues? anyone doubt recall working?  Really? know four people total who've it. uncle two ants one friend teacher. one else family friend group even causal acquaintances it. Yes! one study, says, prevent transmission entirely. main benefit vaccine protects serious case covid.

Just CDC says (per growing body evidence suggests fully vaccinated people less likely asymptomatic infection **potentially less likely transmit SARS-CoV-2 others**. However, **further investigation risks SARS-CoV-2 infection fully vaccinated people cannot completely eliminated long continued community transmission virus. **Vaccinated people could potentially still get COVID-19 spread others.** However, benefits relaxing measures testing self-quarantine requirements travelers, post-exposure quarantine requirements reducing social isolation may outweigh residual risk fully vaccinated people becoming ill COVID-19 transmitting virus others.

Emphasis mine. Basically, CDC suspects transmission still possible less likely, know sure. thanks, I'll get cold flu twice year tough like decades covid. think people going listen mask suggestion vaccinated blues clue mood country. missing something???

You're trying find logic Chicago politics. That's problem. What‚Äôs invite? news would waste time one many...dont depend warm weather curb covid-19 varaints need start selling lmao expect us, expect you. today greater achievement? kiss again?! 

My partner covid I'm seeing least 14 days became symptomatic. exposed, know source. also live together.

I 16 days first Pfizer shot well. 

I've read recommendations isolating 10 days symptoms develop / 24 hours resolved fever. However, want hear people's stories real world.

Has anyone taken proper precautions followed recommendations infected someone intimate shortly completing isolation? 

Thank you! last laugh Basically, think Moderna available OP's country, left off. single defining factor, take totality circumstances. It‚Äôs whether check racial box.


Affirmative action use race determining characteristic, it‚Äôs never reason candidate picked. Thank you, religious, appreciate sentiment. 

Semper Fi. know happen? Thank you, good friend, deserves good send-off. What's absurd factual history?

Educate Data showing vaccines still effective variants. debate educate I'm assuming fearmonger? Comment got deleted extremely annoying auto moderator I'll repost slight modifications taking swearing. seen anything stating this. link actual study read through? stuff read mostly articles general gist would much worse 1918 flu given complete lack care available.

When statistics REALLY considered. dont match journalists telling you. 99.99% people dont bother look statistics critically compare previous events similar nature. main reason history repeats worst ways. know I'm random redditor probably thinking ""why would believe journalists doctors politicians?""

But understand crazy world live in, common person could common sense intelligence trumped degrees, connections, clout. Infact, that's often isnt it? common random people UAE France Japan Zimbabwe christ sakes representatives.

I'm denying virus exists. I'm even making conspiracy theories. I'm simply using statistics show doctors, politicians media stoked peoples WORST FEARS. used scare people complying.

Why that? mean to. grand conspiracy. fear... That's catalyst this. Fear. powerful weapon control masses.

They're scared virus cause health advisors showed RIDICULOUSLY TOP PROJECTIONS released public virus could look like dont lockdown curfew.

I'm Canada, top health advisor claimed Canada would face 20,000 cases day march dont hard lockdown... refused hard lockdown guess happened? Nothing. Cases rose even CLOSE 20,000 day.

So see mean here? conspiracy. grand plan great reset communist take over. 

This one big think quite appreciate insane number would be

What's total amount people critical condition COVID? statistic like would useful me. Assuming course critical condition life support. I'll assume are. makes feel better (fully) vaccinated coworker mine kissed got covid. coworker bit never tested positive.

I work facility 2 cases month vaccines. vaccines 0. got second shots early February. got vaccinated Im scared seems kinda dumb pretend ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Polio primarily spread fecal contamination food water, it‚Äôs airborne, easier stop vaccination sanitation measures. Transmission also never reached anywhere near levels SARS-CoV-2. said before, vaccination work coordinated, global scale, seem reach moment. mean eventually like getting flu shot. take days checking multiple places multiple times get appointment one. I'm acting different rest pandemic...which utmost caution. I'm week half second shot I'm waiting next week go see Godzilla v Kong. first time public gathering place work grocery shopping.

I get sick attribute sticking health professionals advice. stayed home year, masked up, kept distance people. I'm going change things now. teachers get choice whether come teach home? 

I can't really give good answer since know full circumstances I'm college, would imagine Katy ISD provides appropriate resources supporting teachers given well-off part Houston metropolitan area; certainly money given board-approved projects back still high school.  Stay home scared. I‚Äôm least happy it‚Äôs easy get shots cause there‚Äôs reality either don‚Äôt working vaccine yet didn‚Äôt order many yet think quietly stall, apply May/June US vaccination effort substantially complete. allow US donate doses, avoiding need address controversy surrounding Vaxzevria domestically. mean shred ethics either.  Brother, reason right here. plan Easter last holidays since March 2020: staying home merger feast ham turkey things, week's worth leftover myself. would think every school go mask free September? happen. 100%, try find one 2 hours direction Austin, good luck. point vaccination reduce spread virus pandemic ends, do. virus continues spread causing 1000 deaths day US. Vaccination something done sake individuals society large. point end spread virus. happened yet, risk vaccinated people certainly far lower unvaccinated people also 0. Vaccinating people ""living life"". problem facts, data make suggestions. Ignorant people, bad science politics does. 

And fact: elderly home everybody vaccinated covid outbreak. one hospitalized, everyone else that's hard proof ""suggestions"". Vaccinated people get virus, transmit virus. highly improbable seriously affected probably contagious timeframe way shorter, still one.

And that's vaccines work. keep wearing mask. dad vet pre-existing conditions same. mom got first shots Walgreens got call VA two weeks later. Definitely ball drop. way right now? That's got J&amp;J two days. mean? Yeah virus time. Better panic!! Newsom recall really took last spring totally suspended state legislature made executive orders concerning state budget without government oversight (imagine Trump this).

Hes also getting lambasted schools. Initially said wanted run schools July early November made sense. teachers unions reacted basically gave 100% wanted. hybrid schedules, outdoor classes (in state arguably best weather US). districts 20% kids login once. However, afford brutal private school tuition many areas they've person since last September. Newsom's kids private school.

He also took government loans support private winery business.

The dining thing bad optics really brought attention misdeeds. technically indoor dining open early November capacity limits course. ate several resturaunts around time get fuss. Give ya little peace mind, second shot three weeks first (Pfizer) week entire staff work besides came covid. one vaccinated one week second shot. take nice big relaxing breath enjoy relief second shot too. anti-Vaxxer decide vaccine isn‚Äôt right still following CDC guidelines forever necessary! 

So saying anti-vaxxer lol. Unless extreme minority humans medically unable receive it, would know were, **is** you. say anti-vaxxer going get vaccine see happens 12 months. 

This also wildly illogical, nothing going happen 12 months already know nothing happen 12 months lol. Lol child ‚ÄúGoogles friend bruh‚Äù

Jay Z Covid-19 vaccines free everyone America. proof insurance even residency required, vaccine sites country, even tiny rural areas; basically every pharmacy offering it, plus numerous mass vaccination sites.

The American thing ever: many mass vaccination sites actually drive throughs. Works great keeps exposure patients workers absolute minimum! dunno, sounds right that.person said.

House fire -- one went got lot water fast possible, waited around while, thought trying figure out. Eventually way, yeah? right legality it. change fact affirmative action racist. part okay that. can't okay people struggling covid get vaccine first. calling people get appointment, wrong. check mass vaccination sites near you...  I‚Äôm fully vaccinated point. mom sister, live house, getting second doses later week. Per CDC guidelines, there‚Äôs reason shouldn‚Äôt able visit them. people idiots. I'm early 30s, infected 11 months ago, long hauler symptoms first shot. coworker similar age 5 months can't talk easily without going breath. Double profits Big Pharma, lasts 6 months. can‚Äôt say ‚Äúsurge‚Äù that‚Äôs racist. I‚Äôm anti-Vaxxer plan wearing masks public keep distance people enjoy part! rush eat hang bars. prefer quiet evenings home rather large crowd decide vaccine isn‚Äôt right still following CDC guidelines forever necessary! going get vaccine see happens 12 months. going make claim onus prove it. (i know one originally claimed it.) They've free travel... üòë one reasons got bad could happen time flu too. could mutate somewhere become deadly anywhere, time. panic prematurely mom spent days calling get appointment. cancelled future date set. sister spent days getting another appointment different place, worked out.

If 30-yo, I'd waiting til time make 1 call primary care doctor, done. Figure hopefully month two. still transmit people vaccinated, 100% protected symptoms mean yeah, wrong. There's risk going outside period. think certain point we'll herd immunity long enough people get it.

IMO think we'll ever free COVID think cases number hundreds instead tens thousands. did. Something like 5x population. made approved. ones getting shipped since worldwide demand huge it‚Äôs spread many months That's basically proof vaccines block transmission recently dropping like bomb. 

Establishment rules mandates basically reason anyone vaccinated mask point. Wal-Mart today despite compliance generally high 50/50 masked vs unmasked.

They also entrances opened back cashiers manning traditional check-outs counting J&amp;J? Trump right FAR fauci. right wanted cut travel China called racist. cautioned panic overreaction concerned unemployment economy said killing elderly.  economy far relaxed could get arrested washing car driveway despite case counts magnitudes higher.......let‚Äôs face it. pandemic excuse create panic oust trump epidemiology.  cases increasing places new variant mutations virus, really need perpetuate narrative much we're clear. remember reading thing subreddit actually. people gotten vaccines, even gotten first shot far? think understand it.

So let get straight. use actual statistical data. guys argument boils pure arrogance dismissal... comment boils even less that.

And somehow I'M one looks stupid? I'M one looks like understand?

How tragic, death self awarnees slow painful demise observe. haven‚Äôt excited shots since nickel shot night one bar went university Yeah

Fauci tends err side caution he's saying highly doubts US's epidemic forth wave left means we're turning corner Thanks europe let export flows Canada! real MVP. Can‚Äôt wait US open export us. kind weird pfizer shots come Belgium theres pfizer facility michigan lol lol try sharing bathroom 40 Yeah that‚Äôs still huge part population susceptible getting getting vaccines don‚Äôt destroy virus, prevent symptoms, can, will, still spread around unvaccinated, like 12.

I 3 year old. Life back normal vaccine. received 2nd dose Pfizer today! going great going bars restaurants again. maybe not, considering I've lost 50+ pounds since lockdown began. point trying make exactly? levels low? so, talking prevalence covid infections relative points pandemic. levels low comparison times, headed direction highest levels spread state seen. highest nation presently. 

Is point levels low, ought concerned? then, seem making argument covid levels never concern. 

Perhaps could argue spread higher harms less due people high risk death vaccinated. Sure, thats true. really know message intending send, can't meaningfully respond.

If trying make argument, make it. 
These kind rhetorical devices prevalent year obnoxious seem usually used bad faith. probably believe making concerned people look absurd, not. opposite, really. there's &lt;.05% chance get vaccine year? Oh thank God! can‚Äôt point one out.... race US vaccination B117 right now. :P  ""Surges"" little dramatic. yet previous stays.... telling I'm CA experienced all. became eligible March due job appointment within two days. girlfriend became eligible job week later appointment next day. looking local pharmacies something? so, many options. Misleading title article actually Midland, Texas (a 5+ hour drive large city). still demand vaccines Texas. (A quick check CVS‚Äôs site shows appointments cities fully booked.) sudden advance efficacy/safety RNA vaccines going huge boon. You‚Äôre interested teaching public health laws, tell basing whether person get life saving vaccine determined skin color? somehow isn‚Äôt racist doesn‚Äôt violate federal laws?

I think pushed law knowing illegal. time someone takes court, supply isn‚Äôt issue longer gets tossed. NC open now. know Texas, CA even eligible groups PITA get appointment, really need hustle. Checking websites midnight stuff. day got email heath insurer saying please call asking vaccination, enough.

I wonder that's part reason Texas, young folks probably going go hassle it. figure point able walk get vaccine whenever, we're yet. first one gave fever bad fatigue. second one got far 2 days absolutely symptoms besides sore arm. got pfizer studies show that. Literally none. Stop lying. don‚Äôt participate Wasted Wednesday? Glad entire family received first dose week. feel like Santa Clara County fucked lack vaccine supply open eligibility coming weeks someone talking mistrusting vaccines say healthcare, 90% cna's took semester junior college spend time changing patients. one else family friend group even causal acquaintances it.

Have getting tested regularly antibody tests though? think lot people know it. explain R&lt;1 means say? historical precedent could ever suggested this?! Covid 19 accelerated already existing trends like decade. bright side whole thing probably net positive grand scheme things. 50 deaths might sound like lot, it‚Äôs equivalent 250 deaths day US, three times flu normally kills either country. Still bit high, it‚Äôll continue fall month I‚Äôm sure. agree, already sense social responsibility US doesn't. can't shame someone whose shameless. OB fully supportive getting vaccine early 2nd trimester. regrets there‚Äôs proof showing babies born antibodies! Fully vaccinated peace mind :) Thank good work. don‚Äôt think people realize much manual labor getting effort. see syringes assume came like factory. Pfizer Moderna? You‚Äôre forgetting new strains always popping across world. strains stopped impacted vaccines now. obviously, first wave never ends, never 4th wave /s üòéüòéüòé Two shots Pfizer, two shots Fortaleza. Got first dose Thursday, wait 2 half hours feels great knowing we‚Äôre almost pandemic literally fuck ‚Äúincentives‚Äù everything start que plus large investments creation AZ vaccine. lol weird it? one afaik ever tried sue something like schools universities wear shoes lot faster put mask put shoes. people completely moronic... found it. back now. Moderna vials always enough 11th dose, even VanishPoint 25 gauge needles get extra dose half vials. yes, we've months, learned today approved. often get 7th supposedly 6-dose Pfizer vials too. Well, messaging hasn‚Äôt clear vaccinated. lots people still haven‚Äôt vaccinated people still shouldn‚Äôt out. big celebratory thingskke concerts still restrictions. We‚Äôre quite point anything new status feel really secure. we‚Äôre close. uncivil copied posted direct message got /u/getreal2021 word-for-word. Maybe deal guy...

Obviously, agree single word guy said.

It‚Äôs contagious AF lots young people previously haven‚Äôt still getting it. friend pretty careful entire year parents grandma got fully vaccinated went indoor bar activities.

Cool ty! development team third phase one mRNA vaccines, travel every 10 days cleared rapid test didn‚Äôt get see friends family ever, traveled, traveled alone put private room verify data hand could minimize liklihood getting infected infecting others. stuff delivered house curbside pick up. got see friends many many many yards away masks every weeks due heavy travel schedule always high risk, got see trip cancelled got another ten days next trip spend someone, less 8 days take flight time potential incubation (if fact exposed) test taking Got first dose today. grateful. bad, DID. noregrets Copy that. might dumb question haha, want put others risk first one truly finished yet? forgot switch alt debate lol Sounds like flipped shit me.

I offered point rebuttal completely ignored it.

The point minimizing tragedy name worse tragedy. That's call pro gamer move, guess. Quit lazy dude, can't come randomly conversation knowing nothing that's happened within past couple weeks expect everyone fill in. [An English-language article couldn‚Äôt wait booked rural parts Illinois got shot. much supply enough demand. rented car, Amtrack option too. could given vaccines grandmother would have, I‚Äôm sorry she‚Äôs wait.

I wish good health speedy vaccination schedule asap. Children still spread pretty easy wear mask though.  Happy cake day lucky!! redditors worry this. Sounds like got mom then. could asymptomatic carrier. know 80% protected also 100% death/hospitalization like second dose? I‚Äôm 2 weeks first dose Pfizer put really uncomfortable unsafe position in-laws today. They‚Äôve started push boundaries social distancing. even close. I‚Äôm pregnant I‚Äôve paranoid. Hopefully I‚Äôm protected enough get seriously ill they‚Äôve infected brought home. go medical trials again? Israel-like, know. currently US around 70 days behind Israel currently terms first dose. Consider Israel vaccinating double rate point US currently vaccinating.

Luckily, Israel first started dropping cases 2 days reached 30% point, point US currently. keep mind Israel followed smart exit procedure, started let first restrictions go 1 2 weeks that. Israel able crush wave lockdown vaccines, kept strict measures crush potential flare ups, mostly gone. US contrary... Got lockdowns stop spread, managed get significantly weeks help vaccines, mostly open again, enough coverage. Cases rising deaths still high.

So could Israel like situation now, chose to. US fare much worse time coming months Israel end January (the point Israel US now) now. bday memorial day weekend. excited bday since turned 21 way back when! I‚Äôm still baffled comments like that. whole year? still go work interact people, go get groceries items person met friends (keeping distance). Hopefully statement won‚Äôt age like milk great us wedding industry. haven‚Äôt guidelines entire time im sorry loss 6.9 million people fully vaccinated

Nice. appreciate hard work never left house first months pandemic wasn‚Äôt around anyone else besides mom (who never tested positive it) somehow got ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è got second dose almost month ago. Despite this, haven‚Äôt done anything differently. Still social distance. still wear masks, still don‚Äôt go out. seems like everyone going bars without masks live. feel like incredibly happy something right now, I‚Äôm not. Anyone else feel way too? don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm person 2019. can‚Äôt help think.. what‚Äôs point? stay in. Anyone else? fucking hope mask free schools September unless covid basically non-existant. Kids vaccinated yet. kept kids home year, know send back without masks get vaccine. It‚Äôs okay, Mainers call people Massachusetts ‚ÄúMassholes‚Äù. feelings mutual ;) think kind evil plot going, think he's things benefit. mean mandates seem like mostly show political career. problem can't really prove it, nobody knows exactly what's going mind him. time time shown cares others. hard believe actions good people, especially started opening surge conveniently recall movement started becoming real threat. Yes, is.   like olympics. mom teaching 3&amp;4yo NY person since October. 100% mask compliance, without complaint. keep wearing mask.

Yeah, no. believe Moderna stats immunity first second shots. BTS slip away city time WE'RE GOING SEE Yeah kidding. I‚Äôm pretty baffled would say this. mitten state we‚Äôre days away higher daily totals peak back November. wish everyone understood this.

To everyone who's ever thought themselves, ""black culture reason black people hard time breaking society,"" well, empathize harbored thoughts time, gotta come around. Black culture exists purposefully incompatible white society generations generations society refused allow black people participate benefit system. surprising black culture reflect values white culture generations pursuing white lifestyle actively discouraged voraciously undermined pursuit?

The answer is, always be, inclusion sharing spoils society. charts used show efficacy, vaccinated line deviates control line pretty sharply around 10 days first shot. lines measuring positive tests symptoms.

Assuming takes ~5 days new infection become symptomatic, 1-2 day lag someone get test, likely first shot starts working 3-5 days. think saw estimates 80+% efficacy first shot wait kick in.

These vaccines scientific miracles.  ‚Äúyou safe‚Äù might clarify means you‚Äôre like 10x less likely get virus exposed. case numbers still super low, I‚Äôd still wear mask public, indoor place. Super accurate areas people still convince Bill Gates 5G-ing reproductive abilities? #proudofmytown

But really, seems like rural certain regional areas still substantial local proportion convinced enough take vaccine. cannot handle this, folks. Driving insane. I'm doubting credentials. he's saying made logical sense. saying vaccinated people need wear masks goes science saying spread virus. matter educated are, spouting bullshit can't backed up, still wrong, even studied wasn‚Äôt worried it, trust science awesome hear sure you‚Äôre talking went CVS typed Dallas, TX 3 locations popped appts, Houston, TX thing happened 3 locations... San Antonio 1 location plenty slots. 

Not sure live 3 largest cities state 0 issue booking right thru CVS. Pfizer/moderna like 94 95%? Exactly same. round bad weather March 18 meant cancelations local pharmacy. heard grapevine doses available. 47 minutes later, back home bandaid arm. 

I really think May optimistic estimate first dose.

MS huge strain lives it. Flair ups cause permanent havoc people life long.

Its still super early treated mice RNA vax going make business curing article mentions Pfizer also using technique. major one using AstraZeneca. companies, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novavax, Pfizer, hoping 2P mutation works COVID-19 vaccines too. obvious inconsistency belief people vaccines 100% effective

That's rather bland ordinary fact, belief. yes, know absolutely everything vaccines, essentially certain effective reducing covid spread bringing us closer herd immunity, many orders magnitude safer disease itself. certain anything. getting vaccinated=good.

At time, vaccines can't *perfectly* prevent infection transmission own. reach ""100% effectiveness"", population level, creating herd immunity. then, still possible spread thing vaccinated. staying careful=good.

In nutshell, there's inconsistency. fair, testing MUCH less first time hit 60k (summer last year). We're testing like twice much significantly lower % positive, course mention far lower threat healthcare system many vulnerable immunized. 60k last. MSN.com unreliable, come Don‚Äôt care, open already! stupid, it, big deal.

Wait, third? Genuinely wondering. Oh god, it‚Äôs clear cdc isn‚Äôt willing commit anything. Yes course continuing gather data, it‚Äôs pretty clear people don‚Äôt carry it. 100%, course not, nothing ever vaccine? point matter time CDC basically lifts guidelines vaccinated people tells us need mask act curtesy places still require it. 

Something I'm getting really antsy Borders closed non essential travel. since last March live NJ. know single person old enough survived Holocaust ample opportunity, including home bound, get vaccine. them, could gotten end February. 

On contrary, work NY know anyone encountered significant difficulty getting vaccinated matter age. can't vax away stupid. lived like shit year, another 2-3 months, no... R rate spread. 1, infected person infects one person (on average), virus stays steady state. 1, infected person infects one person (on average), virus expands. one, infected person infects fewer one person (on average), virus declines. variants ticking time bomb. B117 surging Michigan unfortunately think moving worst period pandemic date.

This media needs fucking chill crap. Look poor guy. Yes! Nice. wait stronger variation comes country got vaccines nothing lil bbeque :) 95% symptomatic cases, roughly 90% cases. Word ground says barely anyone adhering mask mandate authorities shit enforce it

So already lifted goverment making official matter ceremony clue, likely either summer mid summer. enough time increase vaccine rollout rapidly get thicc Oh dang. forgot country - believe UK - gave anyone working vaccine priority shots. 
It‚Äôs funny best friends never hug other. It‚Äôs mostly randos work going (and family course).

Really, think outlet people depression triggered feelings emptiness lonely.  Living EU, ashamed EU. never bash US again, truly matters way better us. speed vaccination programm (+ ""quality"" AZ vaccination) sometimes feel like living third world country. situation following: Vaccination ramped February older adults healthcare workers. time government decided people get holiday stressful year. created summer wave several superspreading events reported. big deadly allowed variants spread. Pretty sure Brazilian P1 brought traveling immigration. Vaccinations continued speed government less thought done risk population mostly covered. March everybody back work school thinking covered. current wave bad ICU filled younger population (50 younger). 

There lesson learn here. racist say groups impacted covid many reasons related racism. lazy look immediate causes behind (more likely essential worker) address those. Dutch English Translation:

Adverse reaction center Lareb received five reports extensive thrombosis low platelet count vaccination AstraZeneca vaccine. occurred 7 10 days vaccination. cases involved women ages 25 65. 
Roughly 400,000 people vaccinated AstraZeneca period symptoms occurred.

Three patients extensive pulmonary embolisms. One died one also cerebral hemorrhage. Another patient extensive thrombosis abdominal veins. One patient developed thrombosis arteries legs. 
Lareb previously reported three reports involving combination thrombosis reduced platelet count. time insufficiently clear whether picture seen countries. Two reports added information available earlier reports. also clarity nature reports countries. 
The picture resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT, immune system activated strongly body makes antibodies platelets.

Canada (or least Quebec) received 1 dose. affect vaccine effectiveness lenght vaccine duration body? soreness lot worse flu shot me, totally bearable. Basically like bad cold day two (with moderate fever) arm felt like hit baseball bat, tolerable definitely beats COVID based heard friends caught it. Every D&amp;D player knows low 95% chance actually is. Still gotta wear mask public; one knows you‚Äôre vaccinated not. I‚Äôll wait national mask mandates rescinded Thanks! mom came town get lunch like ‚Äúmaybe sit inside.... (because windy)...oh wait... guess still go huh? Sorry!‚Äù Yeah, totally go! Plus debate wearing mask vaccinated kind pointless one two things happen: Either need secure way prove vaccination status need get point epidemic even unvaccinated go without masks. moment allow vaccinated people wear masks, ton unvaccinated people print forge CDC cards. even get full PDF blank card several .gov sites. lmao really don‚Äôt understand you‚Äôre worked got this. mom got tested multiple times, never it. even antibody test blood work done ago came back negative well. didn‚Äôt get mom??? please stop trying explain me.

My boss tested positive quarantine, I‚Äôve heard nurse friend mine hometown hospital seeing uptick patients. clarify readers, that‚Äôs [80% two weeks first mean possibly know, us besides parents getting regularly tested (most friends higher ed tests weekly universities), least tested anytime cold allergy symptoms pop up, working places outbreak would noticed someone would showed symptoms. Even cases missed, would mean know 2 people symptomatic covid (2 people know zero symptoms picked contact tracing weekly testing work) one spread family friends. 

There chance bunch work friends January Boston conference first week 2020 majority awful awful cold/flu got back (I fine), would still super early covid none far bad reaction first covid vaccine suggest already it.  today September. There's literally zero (good) evidence 2 doses Pfizer effective J&amp;J two trials interchangeable. done different locations times different variants, caseloads, levels lockdown/mask compliance.

It's likely Pfizer effective J&amp;J, hardly conclusive fact almost certainly pronounced difference ""74% efficacy vs 95% efficacy"" headlines suggest.   mention couple percent (at least) holdouts immunity previous infection. Getting second shot 21st. First round side effects, arm sore injection spot days. 

I would've preferred one shot apparently 2 shot ones effective. vaccinated father wanted go dinner somewhere immediately backtracked like...wait, vaccinated, crap. way hell I'm catching thing end lol. absolutely mean it. could false negative. common beggining pandemic, much people regularly told act like quarentine anyway, even negative test. 

 mean like magically got lol. literally NEVER let house saw literally ONE except mom, pretty much explanation. bad we're stuck AZ vaccine Australia...  Awesome! Congrats ü•≥ I'm starting think way higher imagined. NJ, seems like becoming easy get appointments I'm realizing people around acting like good/I'm assuming they've gotten jab... bring up, intend to. I'm talking older neighbors, friends mom in-laws. also people eligible too. problem, guess, there's strange, heavy viral load variant comes around, assholes gonna spread it. 

I two young children, I'm hoping vaccines proven safe approved asap.  men, say Dutch news, men too. Indeed. People get vaccinated, maybe allowed choose they're healthy young woman. know countries want avoid right now, problem seem exist Pfizer/Moderna (and probably J&amp;J). got 2nd Moderna last week. felt like I‚Äôd punched arm fatigued beginning 5 hours next day. injection site red spot, hot itchy couple days. also still quarter-size white spot (like vitiligo) first dose. feel fortunate. similar experience CVS. didn‚Äôt ask ID eligible class verification (although I‚Äôm eligible teacher). made appointment, showed up, told name, stuck needle. general vibe seems want vaccine, want give one. social part ends first, cases explode. medical part ends first, slow return ""normality"" frightened people Oh see, defending EU uncivil.

Now know sub many lies EU, purposely kept mods Why? Killing 1 safe another.
If ask young woman take risk, die me.
I say no.
I want 20 year old take risk, however small, get life long complication death.
I believe pretty wrong elderly ask burden younger people.

Although usually pro vaccination, take flu shots such, prevent spreading elderly mother.
As soon risk death comes view taking vaccine, improved continuation.
Other vaccines available show side effect.
Apperently Pfizer safe.

Lets use that. Indiana vaccinating adults asking state id, might big deal. Pain ass younger people tech savvy find appointments Indiana drive them. Sounds like German Lockdown. That's sort title says, misleading. anyone else who's gotten shot 1 felt like mule kicked shoulder next day? incident family recently little cousin hospitalized somewhere hoopla visiting family, grandma became positive covid, getting second vaccine month before. I‚Äôm U.S seeing two different presidents handled pandemic.... Thank you, Biden. I‚Äôm key west first time year more. Got j&amp;j two weeks ago. key.

For young healthy women, AZ look like good deal. hey thats okay im still wearing mask even though im fully vaccinated fully immune yet help UK opaque age distribution, countries spelled out, like Germany, clear risk CVT young women high compared risk dying Covid. They've pounding table variants. surprise headline mention either. body article every article read headline. Neither risk dying Covid young healthy women.

That key here. Risk CVT high cohort. Thank comforting words :) Remind infant mortality occupied territories compared Israeli one? 
Does payments terrorists include children shot legs throwing stones? course does.
Once label whole people terrorists justify anything. Yes putting kids sterile emotionless hospital environment; totally normal Thanks, read that. news vacation couple weeks trying catch again. really everyone needs get vaccinated. Second shot Pfizer yesterday, little arm pain soft flu symptoms. ordered pfizer, moderna, janssen, az, sanofi, curevac read vaccines work well elderly due weakened immune systems. I'm wondering, would efficacy Pfizer vaccine healthy (for age) 71 year old male female?  Seems quite lack perspective facts.

1: vaccine pass, corona pass (either got vaccine, recovered infection negative test)

2: Yes cause regulate businesses loads things. take agumentation one step further, assume also against:

\- Block addults (below 21) buying alchohol

\- Block people driving car dont drivers licence

\- Ban abortion

\- Banning people without vaccine test entering country

3: sunset clause - rule run later august. rate isn‚Äôt high fact remains young women dying probably wouldn‚Äôt died contracted COVID-19. dying cure wouldn‚Äôt killed instead designed protect others.

Hopefully vaccinations care homes mean latest wave show much lower ratio deaths cases. Evidence multiple strains easily given single shot? thought safety concerns around this. depending brand 1st 2nd worse symptoms other. oxford one, night like full fever delusions, next day felt like bad hangover. apparently symptoms weaker 2nd injection. Two reasons

Firstly it‚Äôs decided it‚Äôs better give many people possible one vaccination quickly possible. One shot confers something like 65% immunity population, getting close herd immunity figure stops pandemic transmission.

Secondly, seems longer wait vaccinations results better long term immunity. Gonna tell you's something, covid reserve, got false positives. False positives job fear monger.
What recently, mysterious person(no one knows was, kept quiet.) got taken away air ambulance. vaccination clinic. rare helicopter come get someone, even auto accident. horrible vaccine

What skin got game dude? seem real upset AZ even though perfectly good vaccine saving countless lives countries given insignificant issues. 18,000,000 jabs given, 7 SEVEN died UK!

I understand hate...

And record, I've AZ jab, partner, two sisters brother... fine. know almost killed partner?

Luckily, smart enough position power. Every medication available side effects. People chance severe side effect paracetamol dieing form blood clot due AZ. Well, thank companies producing vaccines. EU exporting vaccines USA. may shock you, many people US find whole pandemic joke, problem making lies wear masks, certainly going extend vaccinated.

There still 80% vaccinated. still 70,000 new cases every single day. still compromised vulnerable Americans forced work starvation wages pandemic. Wear mask stop crying it, sheesh. Rubbish. UK meant get first deliveries September accordance earlier agreement AZ. later agreement doesn‚Äôt negate earlier one. payments get production set exchange first doses valid agreement signing early production ahead plants.

It also doesn‚Äôt affect fact UK factories intended supply UK market first. EU contract even specified initial order EU (of 300M doses) manufactured EU. conflict contracts except perhaps Helax both. EU decided seize entire production anyway guess point becomes moot. Dramatically lower chance catching covid, passing onto someone older killing them. different Americans love Pfizer Moderna Germans love Pfizer Biontech Yes vaccinated people get covid unlikely going mild case get it. every vaccine worked. Hills good publication, god headlines clickbaity. 5% still 5%, exactly trying say?

I asked guy girl really though 5-10% insanely low. Personally, wouldn‚Äôt call that. 1/50000. That's low chance but... chance dying COVID young woman ballpark.

I hope find what's exactly going quickly. young people die Astrazeneca covid 

That's categorically false, I'm amazed dense... think it‚Äôs ‚Äúwe embarrassed trying save face, accusing anyone calling us inventing conspiracies.‚Äù 5 100 die virus, even without vaccines. likely less 1 100, people high risk groups either already vaccinated soon.

If 3/10,000 chance death, vaccine (got second shot two days ago) makes 1.5/100,000 chance death... going worry. 29/1,400,000 high lmao.  vaccine 100% safe, people bad reactions. found, unless I'm mistaken (but think considering AZ vaccination resumed France) vaccine still much safer getting covid (dying covid issue, long covid, blood clots heart diseases issue well even young people) dare say seems much safer many medications commonly taken considered safe. 

Millions people vaccinated. CVS went live bookings FL Finally managed snag vaccine appointment open zoomers compete kids half age faster fingers. Got second dolly dose 3 days ago. kind surprised emotional walking outside after. Felt lucky, grateful like sun come long, long dismal year. grasping straws. purchase agreement EU UK best effort EU signed contract day eelier compared UK. 

Licensing agreement means nothing whether AZ obligated fulfil UKs contract. purchase agreement **the** agreement binding delivering according targets. ‚ÄúThe best vaccine one that‚Äôs available‚Äù Meanwhile german... vaccination ?...

&amp;#x200B;

Like real home doctors get "" to"" 20 doses per WEEK ( forget ) vaccinate high-risk people. I‚Äôd guess swine flu stuff guillan barr√© people ICU point ever before, younger previous waves. deadly killing younger people previous death numbers still steady decline. Lagging indicator, know, I'll keep watching them. 

The two may continue diverge. so, likely people likely die (65+ serious health conditions) largely vaccinated. commit buying doses pay set production. means time get right. It‚Äôs like starting work letter intent contract signing - still start earlier. EU wouldn‚Äôt take risk acted customer. 

There real conflict contracts anyway apart manufactured Commission try create argument UK doses. UK EU contracts name Helax plant UK paid it. UK plants intended Initial EU doses spite UVdL claims clause 5.1 specific it.

At end day AZ production problems. That‚Äôs conspiracy stuff that. EU reached agreement sooner would time resolve production problems. Ah yes. ""Its political EU conspiracy"" still thriving see. big media going make money run big scary headlines post upvoted? Think eCoNoMY!! years:‚ÄùNah nobody really died got sick, fake!‚Äù AMA 

There reports statistics case. trust opinion piece actual evidence.  It'll take Europe get dose. wonder virus hasnt mutated then. would make vaccine useless. We're together said dipshit üôÑ issue use lockdowns less effective become people gets increasingly tired them.

I'm really sure they're still helping atm Im sure user would know more, feel like worth effort would really easy skirt kind controls. snuck red rocks convincing security scanned ticket, really doubt could done properly. virus know inconvenienced it, neither government scientists possibly longer working better vaccine. I‚Äôm sorry don‚Äôt see point you‚Äôre trying make. comparing 9,9997/10,000 chance 95/100?  Ahhh yes, important conversation still point pandemic.

Second, it‚Äôs thrown fuel fire already strong European anti-vaxx culture.

All save face witnessing UK well post-Brexit EU flounders. ICU admissions Ontario higher ever point pandemic, disproportionately younger people past due vaccination elderly people group homes. 

Younger mean 25. mistakenly bringing up. think people come across ""millions"" much normal life lose perspective big number is. two good points story.

US erase Coronavirus like Israel 60 days.
There surplus vaccines nations since US close finish vaccination program. point claiming block transmission literally ignoring science much antivaxxers are

I would say literally ignoring ONE source instead Science. 

It documented vaccinated people still carry transmit virus. 

In Israel, 4th lockdown half population vaccinated. 

In Spain, COVID outbreak elderly residence, vaccinated (except one nurse, brougth back). None elders complications, still outbreak CONFINED, BUBBLED VACCINATED entourage. 

I really understand CDC post. 

Vaccinated people carry virus. 

The virus move itself. people move place place. 

As long vaccinated, strong heard inmunity, masks outbreaks happen (with less impact casualties). Jesus! I'm one them!!! Definitely taking DNA samples linking national database citizens. Heat humidity kill virus faster. spring time Texas bad time virus. Also think already corona burn population dummies non dummies left smaller amount dummies. Ugh getting close 4m day. Hopefully hit today mean europe exported 10 million doses USA UK issue given single dose back. USA 30 million Astra Zeneca sitting warehouse whixh haven‚Äôt approved yet refuse export meanwhile.

We started daycare 2 weeks ago. still feel right home time. I've got cabin fever guess? mean, get sometimes, really want go vacation explore city something responsibilities.

Introvert extrovert, nearly us need break much isolation, much family, much pandemic work stress. need nice vacation. people hateful sub? ask question met severe backlash asking question. Also, allowed post every 20 minutes Reddit banning bitchute links? people sub want encourage dialogue virus restrictions place. seems counterintuitive. End rant. actually sounds like scam. I'd call health department. I'm sure J&amp;J Jassen side effect tracker set up, already, consider reporting whatever system (if one). Yes, country heavily dependent AstraZeneca herd immunity benefit make possible tiny risk CVT. EU countries, heavily dependent Pfizer/BioNTech J&amp;J, calculation different. moved private office day sent home üò´ maximum wizard dude writes cool breakdown? think might getting confused? sounds like introvert shut someone social anxiety. 

I introvert still want go outside, things, see world. want eat good food restaurant, get food coffee, browse book store, travel. don‚Äôt want talk people exhausting me.

You say don‚Äôt want put ‚Äúsocial face‚Äù don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs introverted. That‚Äôs social anxiety.   extra three hours make difference world right? also got bonus three able wfh. never felt better, well rested, less stressed, productive ever worked home. back office now. Traffic light first every day it‚Äôs heavier now. 

I hope don‚Äôt go back office time soon! extroverts complaining loudest (both literally figuratively online) stuff shut down, lack social interaction, anti-WFH (saying stuff like, ‚Äúhumans need social interaction office, everyone needs separation work/home life..‚Äù bla bla bla)

The introverts enjoying period immensely largely silent it, expressing upside effects pandemic us seen selfish, cold, callous. socially acceptable thing want (or publicly express) things go back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù soon possible. ‚ÄúOmg, can‚Äôt WAIT til we‚Äôre vaccinated hang again!!‚Äù I‚Äôve say times humor extroverted friends. Meanwhile I‚Äôd perfectly happy casual online interactions many people seeing person another year. 

Let tell you, it‚Äôs NICE excuse skip certain family functions forced work socializing, look forward stuff returning. Individually issue extroverts. collectively create exhausting social norms hard keep introvert. work meetings need person? almost socializing happen loud crowded bars? people assume you‚Äôre unfriendly you‚Äôre weekly hangouts crowded places? Extroverts set dominants norms deviate get judged. know job going try force everyone back person meetings tbh awful exhausting me. Let people continue work productive, let people call/video meetings, don‚Äôt force people awful team building activities, don‚Äôt judge people wanting stay home long day work. don‚Äôt think introverts suggesting continued lockdowns would good thing. asking extroverts reflect fact exhausting found isolation, maybe sensitive fact introverts felt exhausted almost every day pre-pandemic. mean finally liking around people blessing oh wait always blessing me. Life good deal three people day I'm getting lot introverts happy due pandemic since reason stay inside really hang out/go out. seem dreading post covid. question why? everything covid post covid. say ""no, I'd rather go out/hang tonight"". may stretch, think people want stay others same. way FOMO taking people/seeing social media. Nearly full protection symptom onset ~11 days: lot protection around ~12 days: I'm angry confrontational lol, jive wonton stupidity.

I think vaccine passports going adopted many businesses live US. ones patronize. patronize ones don't. parts country going far prevalent.

I disagree vehemently entire concept likely cloud based, digital, vaccine passport suppose keep private information secure. registry aspect. noted advised posting unedited CDC vaccination cards internet, contain information used access parts medical records turn also private information used identity theft.

Now course obvious retort information already probably available true. I'm going volunteer it. 

If wanted give laminated card says I'm vaccinated present prove would fine guess. Hell, I'd wear scarlet letter V that's took. problem systems like always fakes liars...and get diminishing returns. whole thing pointless imo. came baking gay wedding cakes GOP said ""government right tell businesses do"". comes businesses trying make sure customers safe, GOP says ""nope, we're going let that"". true. inner struggle. Good lord misinformation..... look rate positive tests i.e. 28k people tested positive last 7 days 7million test samples, 0.4% test resulting positive test. R number currently given seems date. Cool story bro haha funny! One mom. Another sister. Kinda hard avoid. source disproves this? 

üôÑ I‚Äôm actually Moderna study phase 3 participant, quite bit reading vaccines Well said, everyone treating introvert-extrovert like political parties lol This. I‚Äôm social introvert. wish people would stop acting like introverts antisocial, sometimes are, definition simply means recharge alone Well that's gets thinking he's cool care virus tbh Little bit different situation going there, get sentiment. Duh? reddit moment Lmao complaining actually real job? Agreed. sad Japan's vaccine caution actually hurting long run. probability young woman dying due AZ still miniscule. Acting though ""unsafe"" ridiculous. Every medication carries risk, Chief Medical Officer literally explained entire country live TV risk death due taking vaccines. Second dose rates high, given large number health workers we're first priority group back December, seems people fine risks. People right refuse vaccine wish, people rebook whenever want, even initially refused. hit May we'll vaccinating young people mix AZ, Pfizer, Novavax J&amp;J. luxury US huge supply MRNA vaccines, given EU likely even Pfizer ramp production Germany, we'll affected export bans. 

We're completely different place US. We've far tougher lockdown since December, higher death rate, public health service capacity US private hospitals have. People want get vaccine. 

It's irritating Americans lecture UK awful AZ vaccine, given real vaccine effect seeing across UK right now, basic fact reason Europe swimming MRNA vaccines, policies US government. think argument would first identified Kent, primary port entry people goods EU. also part extended metropolitan area London, obviously gets lot incoming visitors plane train. Exactly. 

And two positions could win presidency. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt shut Florida‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll ban vaccine passports nationally like Florida‚Äù well could winning message. 

Since vaccine passports political move one seems supported party, take warning. end getting banned anyway sweep Trump2, really worth pursuing? seems we‚Äôd better weren‚Äôt pursued. Yeah, introvert socializing exhausting still like things. like go restaurant, coffee shop, book store, travel. don‚Äôt like home 100% time. like get see world.

Yet shut ins saying would happy never leaving home socialize online. That‚Äôs introvert! Herd immunity depends R0 virus spread. R0 virus spread depends characteristics virus well overall behavior people. 

The % vax'd needed achieve herd immunity higher stop things like masks general distancing habits. obviously read headlines don‚Äôt actually read full articles. two cents means nothing me. Can‚Äôt believe tried falsely report lol. it‚Äôs turn get vaccine would prefer get technology know body received since birth. far know haven‚Äôt issues receiving technology. Chump = you. experience. Working home incredible. gone back office, able continue wfh? Even bought? Shame you. number counts?

So far seen heard good metric measuring long covid. one? know hospitalization rate 1% presumably long covid range. really see even guess. Much world even count deaths using excess deaths possible. 

Maybe 20-40% total deaths normal year? including 1.5 billion people counties fully suppressed. Maybe natural deaths instead total deaths used. 

Related question: many fewer deaths contagious diseases spread? know allowed live life pretty much exactly covid post covid right? I‚Äôm pretty sure read quite early last fall Puurs would global hub distribution Pfizer. assume Operation Warp Speed beginning demanded US funded production facilities used US vaccines first. continue discriminate post-covid, remember best strategy opponent tit tat. study I'm changing jobs partially go back wfh good. New employer across country hire agreement expectation office work Reverse German Lockdown I've thinking April 12th magic date myself. Who's predicting this?  mean that's fair good job ending last wave Covid, got kind lazy trying control recently. variants, shit hit fan. TSA patriot act would like word Good lordy, they're giving second shots already? knew! in, extroverts feel pain pandemic apparently me. one roommate nurse always working sleeping, since rent house together bedroom office thing. might spend entire work week without human contact hardly leaving room. especially bad winter months even want go outside. became debilitating struggle get work. Life felt like lost meaning. I'm looking forward getting back office. fact, I've already told boss went fully remote would find new job go office interact people. Sorry, Biden administration care now... want parts it. want talk people shared experiences.  want stressful things required experiences allow relate group better. often leads internal struggle, torn FOMO comfort security thinking really missing much feels like moment. Haha would tell fuck off?! I‚Äôm assuming mean weed yeah?? brother doesn‚Äôt all, I‚Äôll eat gummy every then. 

I think better article check would O+ blood type. brother two O+, there‚Äôs links shown less susceptible. understand brits pissed get Dutch doses. paid upgrade thought would get capacity themselves. AstraZeneca promised doses Helix also EU. seems like AstraZeneca completely unrealistic estimates production. Different situation way people vaccinated. Could selling point interview. No. Shit. Unlike US, UK mitigation guidelines absolutely forbids household mixing enforced extent.

However, pretend UK's mitigation policies strong scientific basis, especially now. safe vaccinated people meet indoors, regardless Boris says. It‚Äôs testing, deaths hospitalizations going quickly well. Testing obviously result positive cases, isn‚Äôt going cause surge cases. adored everyone. person US would effective would Betty White. source Canada (but also NZ Japan) contract states doses come EU. Particularly US formally created US first police executive order December. actually know contract information shared US blocked exports, become narrative blocked exports. contracts even signed countries? Yeah RufusSG, ever, fails distinguish people different preferences.

Seriously, people want stay inside time. discriminated do-nothing manager wants butts seats. Fuck that. number counts? virus kill anyone left lifelong complications would suddenly big deal anymore? Sorry buddy think guys win sadly. May ask personal question? Feel free tell fuck off, happen smoke? 

I know 2 families exact scenario play out, 2 people didn‚Äôt get 2 smoked. 

I remember early pandemic reading article smokers possibly less likely contract virus, it‚Äôs stuck mind ever since. father gave lot shit it, I‚Äôm pretty glad decided delay applying grad school this. things still it‚Äôs mostly online deal September 2022, guess I‚Äôll suck up, really, really want pay 60000 dollars zoom classes 3M party. Also first true 4M day.

I like period breaking records every day far Dec/Jan whole deal businesses right operate something? different guy? remembering correctly? Crazy think I'm included number now. Blows mind kinda problem reasoning using logic. Florida. charts going make determination. know Pfizer ""equal"" efficacy two weeks dose two Moderna's. we're looking 6 7 weeks respectively get ~95%. 

Your concerns may anything worry over. Nah, never stuff anyway. Books ordered Amazon, takeout food love read, knit sew. guess go yarn fabric stores sometimes, thankfully still open! vaccinated brethren:

Has anyone else issues implanted tracking chip? days 2nd shot, pair DHS agents showed house claiming difficulty getting signal it. wondered don‚Äôt use cell phones, explained it‚Äôs shut cell service still locate us. Anyway, go adjustment local DHS office, quite far fairly annoyed.

Everyone different versions hell year. never planned export single dose US US market saturated. always going America first. get people want steal doses countries‚Äô delivery commitments, strongly disagree.

Is actually source dated December last year? Im introvert , usually hate going . March 2020- August 2020 dope hell. miserable since fall. Straight good time anymore . might also perception mRNA vaccines ""rushed"" pandemic whereas viral vector technology developed ""normal"" pace deployed COVID even started. YEP.

Yup! rediscovered Simpson‚Äôs paradox. really idea ill get long, ""non-hospitalized"" case COVID? many, many people (young, previously extremely active healthy people), never experienced anything initial COVID infection worse bad cold, ended initial illness experiencing symptoms severe six months, nine months, year later can't work they're debilitated. OCD breakdown year two ago getting vaccine. suppose I'm ""insane"", according people, think people could compassionate vaccine hesitancy. I've never missed vaccine, FWIW, generally fear disease much side effects. I'm young healthy, pregnant, would likely take Astra Zeneca vaccine I'm UK. yeah, I'm nervous vaccine, I've probably already Covid risks Covid low anyway, might risks associated vaccine.  Why? Countries like Japan, New Zealand, Canada Australia signed contracts clearly states vaccines sourced EU. It‚Äôs dream thinking even suggest would ever blame US UK, EU block. TLDR summary... evidence source is, spontaneous jump lab accident.   probably never know.   reason author seems much invested spontaneous jump explanation spends number paragraphs hand waving arguments attempting justify conclusion. Yale well-known bringing students based family name, even rest Ivy League. Yeah, exactly that. unfortunately way, *way* harder mRNA vaccine viral pathogen totally alien human body. Like COVID is.

The thing is, trying mRNA vaccine make cells produce large amounts proteins want immune system zoom on. make loads viral spikes, real COVID shows later get fried almost instantly, immune system sees spikes, nukes it.

If try thing cancer cells, lot harder, need find feature surface malignant cells *extremely* sure unique pathological cell lines. Reason make immune system zap everything particular protein surface, pretty screwed protein also appears rare healthy cells thought making vaccine. e.g. tumour cells end getting nuked - nerve sheathing brain stem well, rare cells feature targeting. course made example, give idea - problem absolutely issue viral spike, course, stuff simply occur anywhere body.

To add insult injury, bodies already really, really good killing cancer cells. malignancy manages hide immune system, goes control, already evolved immunologically inconspicuous possible. 

What mRNA vaccines offer (and hope that) way fry malignant cells manage spot targetable marker body's immune system missed. huge help, cases feature like found. please expect mRNA vaccines miracle cure yet. every cancer hard work, even technology available. Dude everyone family vaccinated brother fine. live brother right? going vector there? perception thing.

When event acutely aware around tons strangers. restaurant, dealing smaller numbers, others intimate level.

So yes, similar levels threat objectively, things like bars restaurants FEEL safer lot people.

It also comes normally seeing everyday activity. Going bars restaurants much common going event might times year, much reasonable non-invasive ask.

All say live bay area, place that's taken seriously, work industry...there lot pushback disappoint people wanting broad use passport. live Michigan. I'd way rather surge cases majority vulnerable people protected herd immunity pile dead bodies. think November shutdown supposed do, buy time vulnerable people.

What's happening bad, accounts severity nowhere near Fall/Early Winter wave hit us. state better. I‚Äôm vaccinated thanks indigenous people care everyone local community. Seems like beef really province. chip shoulder isn‚Äôt good look. president Brazil deserves worst karma ever. literally care what's going Brazil covid. studies run pre-specified number cases across groups reached, infection rate (at least partially) controlled comparing Arab, Arab ruled administered area Israel, instead Arabs surround it? West Bank's civilian affairs, including healthcare run Palestinian Authority, who's priority bounties killing Jews, infant mortality.

Still thanks Israeli assistance infant mortality west bank lower surrounding Arab countries. Somehow hold Israel, joke. contract really failed EU AstraZeneca contract. EU supposed get vaccine 4 plants end one plant supplying. (Now increasing 2 EU pressuring)

Moderna, J&amp;J Pfizer/BioNTech pretty much going according plan.  Bless bless bless researchers made possible. sub's predictions coronavirus last year far less accurate coin flips. Fortunately yes life death perspective personally!! 

Just case you‚Äôre asking effort question whether needed avoid catching it, there‚Äôs way knowing time whether he‚Äôll get long haul Covid effects like lung heart damage (which measles used vaccinated it..), added someone contagious circulation days got sick, making much riskier someone vulnerable death came across it. weekend might weird reporting. Don‚Äôt surprised see 1m 2m 5-6m day later week. Reporting delayed holiday. I'd also argue 31% people get vaccine, good chunk probably got sick immunity hard way. dunno, soon we're going hit giant wall called anti vaxxers.

I think we're going surprised scale people get vaccinated. I'm gonna guess around 100 million people get it

My biggest fear declare victory early, spreads continues mutate get variant that's immune vaccine. probably happen american public done little make optimistic.

I cannot believe level traveling taking place. virus highly mutable. Hopefully get level vaccination mitigate heavily. goodness, get pandemic higher death rate wildly doomed. failed catastrophically containing this. No, imagine 10 years old, get COVID another 9 year old parents sent school grandma got vaccine. Lmao. Changing would disgusting act bait switch. 

Not EUs problem, forward complains UK &amp; US. know it‚Äôs recommended, happens end getting vaccinated COVID? vaccine still effective future re-infections, get re-vaccinated later? ""hospitalizations deaths"" could go ZERO long still tens thousands cases day, I'd still concerned. Maybe folks fine idea getting long COVID (which happens even young people even mild cases never require hospitalization) can't afford continue pay rent, buy food, otherwise pay bills I'm suffering months debilitating brain fog, fatigue, heart/lung problems, I'm going allow impatience blind real risk virus poses even ""mild"" cases. 

Nor going risk infecting others. get case numbers far lower anytime last year. beyond baffling people look daily case count three times low point late last spring think we're still middle massive public health crisis. ""The American Church's incredibly poor response virus drove churches away, guilt-trip articles Easter like one bring back?""

Fixed headline would guess theory, states rescind/change eligibility target dates? Like idk, surprise massive vaccine undersupply. CVS doesn‚Äôt want book appointments ppl end maybe ineligible explain contract differences also countries' banning vaccine (and vaccine precursor materials) exports plays this? Another JAQ-off. two weeks, least NYC. check uptick started exactly two weeks ago, hospitalizations actually begun rise slightly last couple days. 

So really remain seen whether hospitalizations spike coming days. So, depends policy goal. terms predicting death next 6 months hospitalizations good proxy includes fact preferentially vaccinated vulnerable individuals high risk death. 

Globally large number cases population young likely hospitalized severe symptoms creates selective pressure immune escape, seen Manus, Brazil probably South Africa. (You could argue it‚Äôs going happen elsewhere matter national policy shouldn‚Äôt worry this; similar ‚Äúnot problem‚Äù attitude present climate change) mean significant important non zero response, antibodies whole picture, cells ones long term management immune response.

It's already established long term immunity even partial.

There immune escape months, completely misreading this. think seeing strong enough vaccine rollout well good model effects widespread immunity Israel back prediction. People done socially that‚Äôs biggest indicator going toward direction normalcy. late, facility set serve global supply chain. Much delivered EU anyway. UK US transparent prioritizing citizens first, EU went global approach. Changing would disgusting act bait switch. 

The EU countries anyway first countries world finish vaccination effort. vaccinated prevent getting covid simply lowers symptoms severity doesnt decrease virus shedding hence transmissability vaccines effect keeping otherwise bed ridden transmitters general public often thus possibly increasing spread? keep telling british lies, nobody half brain believes them. There's malaria one coming cool. Yes, anxiety inherent actually leave house deal humans blissfully gone past year. lost, get it. need better messaging period. step right direction. major issue is... again? vulnerable populations vaccinated children shrug disease due amazing immune systems, I'd love know reasonable cause harm via social isolation reduced education. play nice - signed inferior contracts. received second Pfizer shot Thursday. 5 hours later, knocked out. yesterday chills, body aches, joints hurt, muscles sore, headache. also could barely lift left shoulder (the arm got shot in). rarely get sick, sickest I‚Äôve years. 

Woke morning feel totally fine. still hospitalized die Yea, that's fair. guess Netherlands government understand situation in. work competitive industry, lot competition work, work done quickly showing up. Refusal act swiftly change normal operations basically refusal offer. 

They're used situation guess, realize implications delaying. call OBE, Overcome Events, realize inevitable outcome acting normal slightly sped manner manner crisis. time US allow vaccines exported. looked up‚Äî roughly 450 miles. think case needs tell they‚Äôre playing fire baby safety stay away birth. far know there‚Äôs systematic study Covid effects kids exposed womb - really can‚Äôt bc haven‚Äôt 5 years see. Also, know sure real mother‚Äôs died it. Yes, hope best. Sure, hospital admissions lie. enough evidence suggest there's little this. millions cases study world many undetected. Children generally get ill effects disease. act like March 2020.  single one doses leave European Union EU priority groups vaccinated.

The EU tried playing nice spirit cooperation export bans UK &amp; US mean thanks EUs selfless behavior dead EU citizens. Sounds like food poisoning me. I've heard nausea uncommon Moderna booster. Let help you: 
Infant mortality West Bank Gaza five times Israel.
The whole Middle East toilet superstition, violence racism. 
When eats world better place. This. using Chinese vaccines effective. Interesting, part this? sounded like around Boston it‚Äôs mad house wait hours one person might get dose, didn‚Äôt think worth this. Also Japan - Olympics start 111 days. EU get least 70M per month average Q2. Hopefully even more. single country world get more. 

Pfizer/BioNTech one big success story EU comes deliveries. Also, texas massively testing, many states US fully know scope outbreaks. states even hitting half testing goals. 1/3rd country! title incorrectly translated.

The news item Fra 1. februar til 23. marts har 117.670 borgere inden 48 timer f√•et b√•de en lyntest og den mere pr√¶cise 4069 var positive if√∏lge PCR-testen. Men lyntesten fangede kun 2159 af dem, skriver Politiken. 1910 personer med coronavirus kroppen fik s√•ledes tilsendt et negativt testsvar. Det svarer til 47 procent falsk negative.

Which translates 1st February 23rd March, 117,670 citizens taken rapid test precise PCR test within 48 hours According PCR test, 4069 positive. rapid test caught 2159 them, writes Politiken. 1910 people coronavirus bodies thus given negative test result. corresponds 47 percent false negative.

Even correct translation, article clearly know calculate false negative rate.

If 4069 positive, 113,601 negative (according PCR test). Likewise, rapid test, 2159 tested positive, 115,511 must tested negative.

According numbers given, 4069 - 2159 = 1910 tested falsely negative rapid test.

Assuming positive cases rapid test tested positive PCR test, negative cases PCR test tested negative rapid test (which assumption - know actual numbers are), that'd make 1910 115511 negatives incorrect, 1.65% chance negative false negative. really? 

Yes, odds likely get hit lightning couple times.

Non issue. Mine started hurting 3-4 hours, even though put prescription strength lidocaine patch area. next couple days malaise, fatigue, generalized inflammation swelling. (Especially wrists hands). said, existing condition, ymmv. requested work couple days second shots week, since I‚Äôve heard second dose worse. Idk, think depends think ""black culture"". tons immigrant communities different cultures think ""black,"" many cultural elements totally beneficial, like community family focus. 

If think ""black culture"" gangster rap obviously think beneficial. health declined like 12 hours post vaccine, snapped back. Side effects exist but... bad believe 4 million. US good job purchasing excess vaccines assuming financial risks (the EU not, primary difference), US seems likely fully vaccinated AstraZeneca even gets approved here. especially case given late vaccinators include lot hesitant people perhaps even hesitant accept AZ given bad press AZ received. US making bad decision sending AZ stockpile, opinion, ethical, practical, public relations standpoint. wife got J&amp;J Thursday morning. pretty bad side effects mine worse. Thursday night super rough vomiting night. Barely able eat anything yesterday wife able pop Motrin keep going stomach wasn‚Äôt tolerating anything little sips water. morning first time waking feeling almost normal. Still headache fatigue hopefully food help that.

Still worth it, anything makes realize important vaccine is. can‚Äôt imagine week(s) actually getting COVID. don‚Äôt even know. I‚Äôm talking ass, actually live Dallas suburbs pretty active community. Signs EVERYWHERE masks still No, defective J &amp;J doses using AstraZeneca compounds never released. mean, Sputnik V probably works, maybe bit better AZ, but... different mRNA ones best. There‚Äôs always lots different factors play, even experts can‚Äôt really tell hell going spread virus. still real clue cases cratered February either - can‚Äôt credit much vaccination campaign still pretty early going point. 100% Yes, agreed B117 deadly. providing accurate numbers could find throwing random statistic 60% deadly.

""Health officials partly attributed rapid rise cases B.1.1.7 variant originally identified Britain widespread Michigan. also observed broader return pre-pandemic life seen relaxing mask wearing, social distancing strategies meant slow spread virus ‚Äî many weeks substantial portion population vaccinated."" 

""On Thursday, Michigan officials announced identified first case P.1 variant""

Clearly B117 playing role, rise Michigan cases cannot solely contributed it. 

I cannot find definitive research demonstrating P1 deadly amongst younger people.

I one highly encourage people vaccinated soon wear masks summer least, preferably sure downvoted. think we've often incorrectly conflated policy practice. really need know much population wearing masks weeks ago stopped wearing masks result governor's order. I'm sure some, headlines suggest all.

[J&amp;J running two dose trials right we‚Äôll find sometime soon. Germans stick together overcome current ""crisis trust"" government, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said rare TV address.

It's hard ""stick together"" told politicians hate everyone shares different opinion (green, leftist parties).

It's hard trust government corrupt incompetent core (CDU SPD).

Vaccine uptake UK 80-90%. would never trending twitter anti-vaxxers complaining. Even though show forms ID almost everything life already hahaha So...exactly said, way words worthless study ever published. could told know nothing that. Like said... find benefit... sent places state available already knew them. Yet never could get appointment always said, available another customer already took slot... customer??? likely one numerous bots scouring every site looking appointments. got appointment pure luck hitting CVS site right added new appointments 6AM. Attempting repeat one else failed. timing bots making odds worse. go bar, show ID...do consider level infringement rights? know makes me. Technically I'm introvert, love activities outside house involve large crowds. guess I'd classify mood last year 'neutral', I've really bummed able go stuff. words, I'm introvert, shut-in. surprised said introverts better, tbh. thought everyone hard time across board. 

Introverts longer pressure guilt wanting go out.  They
Already knew entertain themselves.  surprising everyone? young? What's typical diet exercise regimen? seen, IIRC yellow lowest level realistically hit. don‚Äôt even remember seeing ‚Äúgreen‚Äù tier outlined could wrong. Latest studies reveal 75 % Indians wants get vaccinated. figures definitely improve people vaccinating benefits vaccinations seen. CDC director said couldn't. read headline post???

I'm freaking out. I'm stating facts idiot.

And CDC others walked back CDC director said.

If bothered stating facts correcting disinformation dumb rock. might read peer reviewed papers published variants make sweeping statement. DIC CVST levels would normally expect. [EMA's 18th based pre-COVID figures calculated less 1 reported case DIC might expected 16 March among people 50 within 14 days receiving vaccine, whereas 5 cases reported. Similarly, average 1.35 cases CVST might expected among age group whereas cut-off date 12. similar imbalance visible older population given vaccine. 

It's likely numbers much higher though. 18th Germany reported 7 cases CVST, number 31. vaccines effectivivly tested approved FDA? Here's hint study's went much faster....money urgency! reason vaccine tests generally slow takes lot time recruit enough people. recruited people studies much faster.  many don‚Äôt want take vaccine. went college Tennessee called couple seniors asking needed help getting vaccine appointment. One told husband taking vaccine even wearing mask go out. try schedule appointment Walmart town live, would surprise amount appointments open every week. pretty sad worry something prevented. Introvert here, loathe - mental health never bad last spring. 

There's difference introverted antisocial. consider introverted winter brutal. really regret finding opportunities socialize self-care. 

I‚Äôve socially distanced get togethers friends‚Äô patios past weeks big breath fresh air. want pandemic end friends family absolutely miserable, ends also want pushed back world saps energy either. It'd lovely could bend social working structures people choice optimal environment you‚Äôre concerned specific medical condition, talk doctor Reddit. much national pride pointed this, information seemingly slow appear. gain trust obfuscating word ‚Äúgreen‚Äù tier yet? Haven‚Äôt seen anything pop weeks. Lmao different seeing real person front eyes. would want Yes called ambivert. I‚Äôm much happier focused I‚Äôm office ngl 1. Pfizer vaccine 91% effective 6 months data available. messaged poorly surprised people read ""vaccine lasts 6 months""

2. Real-world evidence suggests otherwise. Vaccines sharply reduced community transmission Israel UK. US would likely much worse situation vaccines already administered

3. See 2

4. world immune yet many countries reopening enough people vaccinated Yeah think lied biggest everyone. Introvert first year 30 yrs didn‚Äôt symptoms SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder). clots occur ""normal settings"". armchair statisticians think can't talk authority things know knowledge on. 

Again, looked research know there's specific type thrombocytopenic reaction following vaccines. That's reaction, random clots isolation. clots found brain, also lungs spleen.

There data reactions spontaneously occurring general population, happen. Got #2 yesterday ill effects outside headache sore arm. Fingers crossed you! J&amp;J works fine asymptomatic infections. Yes middle. term used ambivert. really doesn't, little experience appointment gone time hit site. better concentrating couple sites hitting hard.

They useful vaccine supply looking something specific sure you‚Äôre following news starting indoor events couple weeks. much happen next days, OC already Orange Tier probably yellow next month. back normal summer pretty easily. That‚Äôs fair point. basically point little incentive aggressively adopt use within borders act aggressive sends signals.  honestly might circumstantial end.  could tank approving citizens use 15% stock. exist? always like this. miracle civilisation all. 60% people selfish idiots, fortunately they're never organised 40% holding everything together. Nice. able get depressed hour past year. article says recommendation pilot scheme need offer paper alternative use/don't smartphone. suggestion **in addition** offering passport smartphone. 

It also says passport must show information proof vaccination photo.

Sounds OK me. Early data suggested J&amp;J efficacy good enough one shot. would interesting seeing J&amp;J's efficacy would 2 shot regimen. might useful second pass later, supply longer limiter. I'm extrovert social anxiety. get energised around people (not extrovert loud centre attention way, always feel less sad I'm others), serious illness etc, developed social anxiety, get scared around people even though that's makes happy. really really annoying. Yeah, way understandable response. However, people realize global context sort make hoarding vaccines problematic approach. issue EU producing lot vaccinations yet lagging behind massively actually able roll personal use. facing difficult decision continues, may forced take control production. However, do, screwing countries including UK slow global production.

The vaccines produced EU often partially use resources countries like UK. stop exporting, UK probably respond boycotting production. everyone loses scenario. Hence European politicians angry US UK government. EU allowing current status quo continue ensure maximum production vaccines indirectly punished regions put utmost priority called ""vaccine nationalism"" . 

So EU really bad spot. could heavily prioritize citizens like UK US done, would screwing everyone else process probably gaining much due reduced import resources. tried impose stricter regulations, called out. kind weird considering EU literally bleeding resources right another article this. I'll honest, European threads bother me. People praising countries response comes expense others. family members California vaccinated, even perfectly healthy 16 year old nephew. Meanwhile, 85 year old grandmother living Belgium yet receive vaccine lost best friend COVID, aged 78. probably saves time overall (people need continually refresh 10 different sites check availability)

With current demand, even without sites, doubt decreases actual administration rate (compared site exist). 

It probably counterproductive non-technical people know resources (they get left behind everyone else snatches appointment) I‚Äôm even extrovert, I‚Äôm also anti social shut in

I‚Äôm pointing hypocrisy call ‚Äúintroverts‚Äù mental health like feel like opinion *more correct* harder commit it.

Same reason enough many religious people believe follow tenets, safe knowledge they're going heaven; try force people follow religion too. Statistically likely get blood clots contracting covid taking vaccine. California folks 


Looks like California hit 4 million vaccines HPI Q1 day now. changes hit that? helpful plant 5 trees. That's helluva lot Japan. Traveling Europe America might restricted, several countries Asia-Pacific region arranged travel channel Amongst (eg. Aus, NZ, Taiwan, China, Korea, Singapore, etc) called ambivert. Well then, sounds like politics general fucked horribly biased rife hypocrisy either way. yet- lot vurnerable people vaccinated fully vaccinated yet, enough acquired immunity population prevent new 'wave'. trend new cases hospitalizations already rising(as expected loosening restrictions, increasing social mobility contagious dominant variant) number states, notably Michigan, reproduction number rising nationwide. 

Quitting masking helps prolong pandemic, I'm sure nobody wants restrictions longer necessary. smart put masks kind - helpful outdoor places, example, cloth masks effective surgical masks or, even better, N95s. 

Thankfully, current vaccination rate looks like natural immunity start larger effect case trend within month, general population starts getting vaccinated. wearing PJs time. dread putting real clothes again. hope everyone agree pyjamas legitimate outdoors/work clothes on, know much nicer wear constantly. Oh would risks vaccinate senior comorbidity? thought would like kind precautionary slmeasures specific conditions (like taking kind meds things). Also, thought vaccines preffered specific groups because, mentioned, vaccines recommended groups. entire nonsense telling people mask needs come end shit like this. person could well vaccinated mind damn business. Basically, private long among others vaccinated even low-risk unvaccinated people household, proceed pre-March 2020. Otherwise, it'll probably 2-3 extra months recommendations public substantially different now. mean, extroverts fucking mental health since dawn time. guys suffer year, also basically reason virus bad first place. doubt introverts go bar feeling great. correct, we'll wait EMA's meeting 6th, point, hard imagine get proven eventually.

We see two specific disorders, DIC CVST, occurring higher rate would expect. also know serum patients showed anti-PF4 antibodies, indicating clots caused autoimmune response. shared factor among people know vaccination AZ, something would expect generate strong inmune response begin with. could still early say, AZ look like likely culprit. 

This mean AZ scrapped. clots still rare benefits still outweigh risks vast majority population, bury heads sand pretend like nothing happening. term ambivert. Sometimes pre-COVID I‚Äôd get mildly jealous extroverts feels like social professional advantage energized people. lockdown made really feel them; coping super well bit even hit breaking point. We‚Äôve got struggles, hope learn empathetic other. get work home means hear useless office banter people legally stay away me? Nice. side effects? Boss: ""You talking much, everything okay?""

Me: *crickets* College student here. understand online school good people. case me. motivation way down, I‚Äôm lonely, technology nightmare. Thats Sinovac, 83% efficacy asymptomatic case Turkey, 100% efficacy moderate severe case.

Sinopharm 86% efficacy asymptomatic case UAE, also 100% efficacy moderate/severe case.

Anyway, sufficient end pandemic. Yep. wish JnJ shot, given Moderna shot instead. follow approved plan (and get second dose scheduled date). might speculate I‚Äôm ‚Äúsafe enough‚Äù two weeks first shot, found recent studies support this, armchair quarterbacking CDC Moderna scientists vaccine used. played fuck ton video games pandemic, I‚Äôm getting real sick them.

As means demonstrating ‚Äúrestrictions safety sliding scale‚Äù think it‚Äôs fine. matter, that's always rolling average mean died never got corona virus. solution give everyone adequate access health care, keep dividing populace smaller smaller ethnicity groups. site awful mobile. Tried read article multiple times. Real world trials including recent CDC paper conducted January-March almost certainly looked variants US, they‚Äôve circulating since late 2020 Yeah, vaccination site filled in. I've arguing people skeptical possible adverse outcome seeing yet even 0.1% people serious adverse reaction, that's 100,000 people. There's way know that. 

These vaccines wildly safe. don‚Äôt miss restaurants, coffee shops, book stores, travel?

I don‚Äôt really need socialize people outside family want things home. like home time time.

I whole list restaurants want visit getting vaccinated. 10x saying 31 100,000. things add up. Use 50% hospitalizations, severe sickness quickly see deadly variants massive problem. Look P1. stuff problem. care why...? hope means receive least 15% BioNTech doses previously thought June (EU) reduced quite bit eliminated A. completely

B. Vaccines thing show efficacy. 

Seriously? Pretty sure many 1.8m got AZ vax today, they‚Äôre back saying happen could become leading cause re-infection.

Can link this? read couple weeks months ago asymptomatic spread dubunked misremembering? Introversion extroversion fall spectrum. probably fall somewhere near middle. Anecdotally, lot people seem fall near edges talking people however. doesn‚Äôt support lockdown narrative!!! new strains 2 weeks! Unfortunately colleges, especially public ones, seem resistant going back normal. governments also letting decide guidelines foreseeable future. like huge medical procedure. get needle. protect around novel virus. schools require vaccinations measles stuff admission? reality we're getting point vaccination lot arguments favor public health start become balanced favor opening economy terms potential outcomes ranges outcomes depending policy. Oh man, girlfriend moved much bigger place last year, killing us house pretty much empty visitors whole time. people gonna one main fun things moving. p1 variant resistant natural immunity. understanding nobody. mRNA viral vector vaccines give body instructions fight spike protein covid-19 virus. new variants, multiple mutations occurred spike protein. 
So reading, experts 100 percent sure current vaccines supported fight new variants due mutations. Also moderna Pfizer already works booster shot companies said may need third dose required people received full cycle. Doesn‚Äôt sound like super confident initial product. I‚Äôm anti vaxer means. Receive flu shot every year, Pneumonia vaccine every 5-7 years ect ect. articles I‚Äôve read support claim vaccines effective variants ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù. Nothing proven yet like efficacy vaccines original strain. Like said. hope I‚Äôm wrong hope vaccines going bring life back normal. LOOKING INFO thought might have. chances die vaccine always low

I get this. 

The chances die Covid young healthy person also low.

If young healthy woman UK, I'd like know risk get CVT AZ shot compare risk dying Covid. here. everything seems like routine now. Unfortunately surprising given increasingly questionable use AZ much stops transmission B1.1.7 not. evidence beginning suggest lot asymptomatic cases AZ b1.1.7 Earlier week, director said vaccinated people can‚Äôt spread it. today, they‚Äôre back saying happen could become leading cause re-infection. lot People 60, don¬¥t smartphones, Oof. article Trump-ian I'm Canadian apologize fully understanding system works.
Still, professionals smarter either us say safe, probably safe. Everything guy 2024 getting coronated Mar Lago Former Guy, case Former Guy decides run again. People getting blank cards? Glad me. None definitions people go seem accurate. ""extroverts recharge going socializing"" thing may seem like nice idea, absurd. know tons people socialize lot need breaks, included. None us introverts.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt HATE pants?‚Äù mentioning age gender gaslighting level I‚Äôd expect countries. nonsense doesn‚Äôt stay UK. think news doesn‚Äôt travel across pond? read Reuters main news feed read plenty Americans. 

As is, AstraZeneca isn‚Äôt approved United States, don‚Äôt worry it. Hence emphasis UK women. 

Did know AstraZeneca tried bullshit scientists hired evaluate clinical trials here? It‚Äôs trustworthy company. 

I wouldn‚Äôt die AstraZeneca hill you, it‚Äôs choice, always. think right approach well, continue caution. activities already built virtual social circles friends across world. life barely changed since pandemic. still fun, still ""hang out"" friends game. Mental health time high able cut daily 3 hour daily commute work. That's mind boggling part this. almost like guy COVID's payroll. Last year opposed lockdowns infringed private businesses' right operate, he's... telling operate. one forced wear seatbelt. sanctioned caught without wearing one, there's one sits car force put everytime drive.

Horrible analogy. biggest thing noticed working home wanted pursue hobbies, go more, social. Almost like office people care less drained social battery every day. Started messaging friends often, going hikes work, still social distancing I'm looking forward social hobbies safe reports Germany, Norway, etc. matter time cases would found UK too.

Yet us merely pointed labeled conspiracy peddlers jealous glorious British vaccine. But...what mean wet? water actually wet? things _become_ wet water added them? Hmmmm article says called offered shot though, don‚Äôt think case kind big brain research contradicts manufacturers cdc?  true every group. exciting! Quite depressing second Easter cancelled We'll see, there's zero chance wait June get first shot. There's going much supply enough demand nationwide happen. Covid specific, common sense employees able work home less direct oversight perform well, however corporations actually saw productivity rise. changed lot corporate outlook remote work feasibility. would tremendously helpful. I‚Äôd also like see companies invest tech allows smoother hybrid meetings. cant claim something cant back up. can‚Äôt know that. 

Many countries massively underreport cases deaths. 

Mexico recently revised official death toll 60%. 

If new variants showed lots countries either didn‚Äôt notice falsified reporting. We‚Äôve seen people color get higher rates hints skew towards demographics, income levels. proven individual level person color susceptible. Literally 7 days ago post posting vaccination card social media presented threat identity theft. 7 days later we're admonished enter vaccination record database managed secured -???- means *definitely* remain secured present threat. 

And public opinion, least around here, fuckhead murderer/rooting disease continue, sort dissenting opinion.

I'm shit. Businesses services requiring vaccine passports eat ass. remarkable, though, every time read CVT incidents UK, always read foreign websites first. BBC mainstream (nevermind tabloids) take ages publish it, usually splashed front page wont. 

There definitely something going stopping bad news AZ prominently displayed imo. cool living place 50% adults received one dose vaccine 10% adults (the vulnerable) fully vaccinated. cdc horrible messaging say something objective like whether vaccine effective variants, I'm inclined believe them. ‚ÄúIf get major surge continuation increase cases, conceivable may wear masks 2022,‚Äù noted. ‚ÄúBut continue get people vaccinated, get overwhelming majority people together infected level infection goes way down, likely to.‚Äù¬†

The headline bit glass half-empty, good news! Yep. Immunity original strain gives broad immunity UK strain. less true South Africa strain although still seems level immunity natural infection. probably broad protection severe illness got still rather air.

Places huge number cases generally spikes exception New York Northern New Jersey density high there. southern New Jersey simply fewer people it. much UK strain Texas Florida percentage Michigan Michigan 25% state virus heavily concentrated Detroit Metro. rest state relatively little entire time except spike fall.

That means either permanently excluding people fault point everything open everyone regardless vaccines. It‚Äôs lot money, time,and effort small amount time.

That's slippery slope is. People missing point here. Correlation =/ causation.

Areas people (like cities) tend blue. Areas less people (like rural areas) tend red.

More people = fewer open appointments. Fewer people = open appointments. That's real mechanism.

But since people = blue fewer people = red, people thread thinking red = appointments, isnt cause. published CDC studio sample groups well real-world deployment Israel says block transmission.

***At point claiming block transmission literally ignoring science much antivaxxers are*** Honestly, think bad reaction first one, you‚Äôre less likely bad response second one. 

Unproven theory: may perhaps exposed Covid past. theory maybe exposed Covid past, first shot side effects, body recognizes spike protein. Second shot, minimal effects. hand, never exposed Covid, second shot one side effects - that‚Äôs first time body recognize spIke protein. Cries European. think people grasping issue this.

Yikes. Shows desperate vaccines. would never let people take vaccine causes blood clots LMAO couldn‚Äôt pay live Texas.

I'm sure agree reasons overall agree incidence drop significantly summer due seasonal effect, probably falling significantly May. virulent strain know may different year vaccinations hopefully pull further. 157.6 shots US would 61% adults single dose used strategy. Probably would less confusion second dose hoarding well. Braindead article. public private sector put everything could afford develop vaccines quickly safely possible. Furthermore, vaccine production facilities almost exclusively privately owned.  One time, Dr. Anthony Fauci AKA DR. GROUCHY punched baby said ""I cured stupid dog, hundred thousand dollars"" answered question ‚ÄòWhats going Europe‚Äô. know one resist fried dough. Probably made month.  said 100 days mask? 100 days vaccinate 100 million? increased 200 mil since milestone already hit   Maybe they‚Äôre less likely jobs don‚Äôt require around lots people may may give damn taking precautions.    Lol, became eligible job I‚Äôll guess early mid March. Vaccine appts still wide open then. county green lighted almost everyone 16 could get vaccinated San Diego - hustle. doable, found multiple appointments, lot searching, browser refreshing, zip code tries, staying 3 AM. early mid-March toward end health care worker 65+ group got appt next day within minutes. easily 60 appts location checked.

Important disciction. lot vaccinated individuals wanting get lives, stop hiding basement like ? Actually EU signed contract earlier UK. 

So reap sow really argument. Thats bs know it. numbers inflated. Anyone 78 natural age life. guys ‚Äúwoke‚Äù wake reality.

Like someone else replied, I‚Äôve blocked couple days work second one. helps, saw article side effects aren‚Äôt bad sign, immune system responding appropriately. got üí™ Congrats! too! risk reduced still easily kill people observing control measures.

You're Covid equivalent anti-abortion people. KiLlInG BabIeSsssS..1!!1 BioNTech Marburg expect make billion doses year, it‚Äôs pretty significant site (if largest one whole supply chain) 
 
This capacity increase benefit whole planet. numbers minute making big deal political. need better mask/seal then. grateful finally got first dose Moderna past Thursday. Got second one scheduled 27 days! Introverted here. Checks out. Fuck ya! USA USA USA!!!

Got shots now, we'll get there. Call doctor, unless you‚Äôre showing signs severe dehydration goes long time something, don‚Äôt think ER trip needed. Wow.. big brain article. Much smort Strangely, no. pretty much said understands thanked guy. idea removed. Two weeks one shot surprisedpikachuface.jpg getting through.

I'm pretty fucking sure messaging ""vaccines likely stop transmission ticket get back normal,"" happening. People usually stick first thing hear lot harder make change minds after.  Covid spreading **70,000** day. vaccinating 2.5 million day. Covid soon. claims impending doom misinformation. Stop. Just. Stop. can't easily kill people. would rare vaccinated person spread unvaccinated person. Every single study shows that.  statement making discourage people getting vaccine, easily kill people. safety family, friends community please stop rubbish. dangerous. people don‚Äôt want ever go outside again, Covid provides convenient justification, makes heroes ‚Äúsacrificing‚Äù things didn‚Äôt anyways. won‚Äôt give easily. Sorry, what?  Given name ‚Äúdistributed‚Äù that‚Äôs you‚Äôre implying. 

160m given 1 dose means ‚Äú160m received 1 dose‚Äù. Nice! 

I‚Äôve heard younger people experience rough second shot, 24 anticipated bed weekend. Happy that‚Äôs case. That‚Äôs true now. COVID vaccines Emergency Use Authorization, means they‚Äôre fully licensed mandatory. pressure change current policy makes optional Want DM me? would love talk this. work healthcare US broken. recently changed jobs hopes force small change here. Happy chat you. attempting predict well.

‚ÄúBack normal‚Äù mean lot things. example people things like wearing masks sick future. places like airports might still scare people since countries might good handle Covid airports probably first place encounter folks countries. 

I‚Äôll define ‚Äúback normal‚Äù places US required wear mask social distance. 

I think happen cases go low confident won‚Äôt start going back up. 

How low need go. CA 2 (or 4 tons testing) new cases per 100k pop yellow tier. could imagine 0.5-1 new cases per 100k pop. announce green tier soon since strict state restrictions imagine states les restricted.

The second part confident cases won‚Äôt return like around thanksgiving. vaccine comes in. 

Now vaccine rollout projecting best worst case scenario current numbers (158M doses, 3M avg daily doses) linear growth vaccine distribution (+.2 vaccine week). puts us 70% adult population fully vaccinated May 31st.

For long vaccine effect cases watch Israel. numbers stated plummet 1 week 50% population got fist dose. taken month dropping get low numbers. 

So puts us around end June. faster vaccine rollout people choosing get vaccine could make happen sooner. Also higher lower stating case number make plummet take longer slower would good people wore masks social distanced numbers start dropping again. 

Obviously variant isn‚Äôt protected virus messes everything supposed unlikely. 

Given booking vacation see family July vacation friends August. I‚Äôm planning wear masks airports/planes tourist places I‚Äôm sick otherwise. see predictions accurate cancel vacations. bigot! Get shot! Wear fucking mask! shut up! Ughhh Republicans right guys? It‚Äôs scary. virus isn‚Äôt dangerous age group. Palestinians trade, can't import missiles arms easily kill Jews. Sounds like bothers you.

They travel, Israel. cross Jordan whenever want. Characteristics imply inevitability always.  Natural reservoir hundreds miles away. Lab right neighborhood. probabilities scenarios tilt heavily one direction. India took Covax vaccines kept themselves. think you‚Äôre right. didn‚Äôt catch March Madness. spreading March Madness. Yeah... whole idea anyone challenges EU critical troglodyte tabloid died earlier year.

The EU beat death actions.

Michigan cases per 100K low Bottom 10 states. Michigan total deaths per 100K (which may better indicator total cases) 11th.  enough BioNTech plant smaller part supply chain believe. 

Absolutely! really hope work together leave situation collaborators rather adversaries. course! I'm blaming director, press. press completely botched sole responsibility. really sad.  Low blow üòÇ seriousness try best, really difficult moment different opinions fake news mixed in. Apologies get anything wrong! Why?

People traumatized, gaslit president whole year half mil died, government given us bogus info everyone‚Äôs first time! Logically know two weeks moderna vaccine done it‚Äôs job I‚Äôll safe I‚Äôm still getting anxiety going plane. come around! calling stupid? 

I wasn‚Äôt actually. Dunning-Krueger nothing intelligence (directly) it‚Äôs overestimating capabilities recognizing depth. dont think certain nuances really change equation much.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* concerning thing they're testing anywhere near be. Dozens states lagging way behind testing rates, whereas Michigan exceeding them.

many states given keeping track. concern is, states already started spiking know yet. Michigan declined sooner rest country, spiking sooner 

I'm saying everyone panic, settle reality we're declaring total victory early. many states got rid safeguards another surge. don't. know kids problems now, long term.

And masks decrease access education. Yeah, think J&amp;J clinical trial better thought out. went 1 dose trial, followed 2 dose trial case 1 dose doesn‚Äôt work out. 1 dose approved, 2 dose trial wrapping well. 1 dose wasn‚Äôt approved, fall back it. end, FDA CDC felt comfortable recommending 1 dose. kids got flu shots. ever symptoms, give meds send anyway, took day work kept home.

I cannot believe year this, still people acting like flu bigger deal. wrong you? Apparently lab-grown viruses inevitably mutate toward certain characteristics. Samples beginning outbreak display characteristics. controversy politics intervened. Wait...he March madness FIVE DAYS ago died Covid???

These timelines aren‚Äôt adding up...it usually takes 2 weeks covid progress point. 

Was game covid?? 160,000,000 doses given. 100,000,000 Americans received least one dose. heard little this, apparently way make universal flu vaccine. I'll google bit. got second Pfizer yesterday. instantly felt pretty fatigued, huge deal lazy Friday night. wake little earlier wanted Saturday arm sore, complaints. friends really struggled Moderna‚Äôs second dose everyone different. good subreddit actually allows arguments least ;) get 2nd shot then. first still 80% effective according recent studies. Marburg facility gets lipids Merck Germany, sure possibilities outside UK. It‚Äôs 16 hours since second Moderna shot. 

I... feel okay? Honestly feel day first dose. I‚Äôve got headache mild aches chills, nothing little DayQuil isn‚Äôt fixing. Excellent news. It‚Äôs time start considering...now what?

It‚Äôs taboo say coronavirus like flu. But, mass vaccination targeting seniors vulnerable young overwhelmingly fine starting get vaccinated themselves...it‚Äôs finally tamed flu. Cases May ebb flow like flu vaccine data showing prevents hospitalizations death...ie flu. 

A new metric needed. number cases rather number hospitalizations deaths. long continue decline, headed really good path.

Another month 2/3 country vaccinated. It‚Äôs time return normal. Finally. going slowly no-one would notice suspended not. I'm kidding. said 70/80% adult population fully vaccinated Italy start July hear you. We're still isolating next 3 weeks. Wife get pfizer dose 2 week. good see folks, get kiddies joining classmates going school. hah, forgot that. spring last year, one kind obligated go one voluntarily went to. that, thanks. lot people actually keep them?? Still, even started month could sizable share elderly sick still, could skew risk calculation quite lot. Would interesting see numbers. production facility nothing Pfizer, independent Biontech facility.

It built German taxpayer money specifically expand production capacities within EU.

It's true German government naive (again) put export ban facility either, case could totally it. stocked canned good sanitizer afraid Valentine's Day surge. say someone lives alone used like things myself, longterm social distancing measures brutal. absolutely understand importance now, people suggest permanent really messes head. used love crowds, going packed show/theater alone, escaping crowd. feels like everyone see im time introvert. spouse working home kiddos distance learning never alone.

Never. Alone. Ever. it‚Äôs question free speech question public safety. vaccinated 2 milion people yes, 5 milion signing jab. really bad wave rn. people dying, there‚Äôs place ‚Äòfree speech rights‚Äô people literally put danger people‚Äôs lives first thought started envy extroverts. too. cried whole way thanked volunteers. Lost many loved ones this. Thank god it‚Äôs almost over.  trying ""gotcha"" average American intricacies EU / UK healthcare? Come man. 

If clear question, part Brexit refers UK socialized medicine part refers EU. horrible people like exist common that? IL. Chicagoans phase 2 really getting screwed separate distribution city vs state. chicagoans fortunate cars driving 5+ hours downstate shot. vax registration systems city like trying buy Lollapalooza tickets find you‚Äôre one 50k people virtual queue 5k appointments left. not, heavily reliant UK this. global limiting factor supply avenues supply. 

The important thing drop rhetoric work work together Baloney. Moderna testing booster two mRNA sequences, one SA variant. see immediate reason would present safety issues. could wrong. 

When infection, multiple mutations virus happen inside you, present exposure. two variants immune system respond unusual.

I'm saying happen Texas. that, moment, appear happening yet. think agenda legitimately figure groups conflating.

But see rational level headed. model healthcare think British have? Keep mind UK previously report cases all. Let's watch little first. üòÇüòÇ

It's funny people forums probably arguing every day haha Superbowl surge coming day now! PA...I‚Äôll eligible 4/19 counting days. come that, EU would certainly ban exports Pfizer countries outside EU. EU-based lipid production large enough serve EU supply chain, global one. would serve one, UK less leverage assumed this. Actually, half republicans don‚Äôt want vaccine Biden administering it. Trump charge, democrats skeptical. It‚Äôs unfortunate *someone* politicized fucking virus, damage done are. It‚Äôs anti-science, though Republican policies tend anti-science, it‚Äôs politics. shameful reflection country. stayed away completely yesterday. first attempt seeing since covid even though live hour away. put rules place like stay outdoors, wear mask closer 6ft, hugging kissing, wash hands, etc. almost violated. young kids don‚Äôt understand in-laws think overreacting (despite husband literally physician treated covid patients - it‚Äôs huge point contention) many security breaches. FIL even offered share water 3yo wtf. weren‚Äôt purposely malicious forgot lot. I‚Äôm going allow everyone fully vaccinated, damage done. covid definitely :-/ In-laws apprehensive vaccine. think successfully convinced FIL MIL evangelical talking points. Ugh. husband many loooooong talks last couple days hopefully get onboard. still shock happened. also found MIL took niece dance recital day ONE wore masks, even instructors FIL spent hours kind ceremony elks club couple days that. think they‚Äôre safe. Same. expecting wallop second, got little stiff arm injection site hour that's it, headache, fever. treatment type clotting notoriously difficult thought since bleeding clotting time brain. It‚Äôs melodramatic excuse people incapable handling kind inconvenience.

You listen people make sound like children lost souls putting mask. 

Like Jeeze man it‚Äôs lifetime pandemic vs wearing mask. American selfishness never display. Suicides irrelevant don‚Äôt usually get news articles. Hmm worry, # plummet start run anti-vaxxers get it. Introvert here, I‚Äôve loving alone time. Meeting gathering people always chore me. I‚Äôm also germaphobe, staying height pandemic super easy me. manufacture mRNS synthetise antibodies instead manufacturing injecting antibodies directly? Well that's job. Sorry feel attacked something relevant you. It‚Äôs strange messaging prevalent. Seems similar CDC saying wear masks Last year save masks medical professionals. 

When 30% country vaccinated don‚Äôt want people feeling like vaccine fixed everything pretend doesn‚Äôt does. hear extroverts great returning office is. introverts look remote work opportunities. overwhelming majority covid cases low enough severity dealt home, masks come off.

That never case. Even among healthiest people, hospitalizion rates around 2%. standard ‚ÄòRona.... known variants 70%. think could simply lack good style. shows poor style mock people wearing masks. Well roadmaps, first sign Sun told 6 people outdoors.... start raving fighting huge crowds leaving piles rubbish gas canisters behind...

 .. get told roadmaps delayed everyone be.. ""but... why"" wish full lockdown permanent, bliss, traffic noise/fumes, could walk dog peace, loved it. wish introvert towns, even neighborhoods.  Im super introverted plus diagnosed social phobia almost avoidant personality disorder WFH soothing depressing af time. hate obligation going office never talk anyone, going back WFH relief, like feel whole inside instead painful loneliness (while Im sitting alone day desk) ..

I cant win, dont know wtf won't.

The government allowed regulate business, falls that. Got second one past week. It‚Äôs wicked 36 hours dunno. buddy virus, late 30s fever 11 straight days. going wife, sure gonna die. No, posted someone posted Discord chat, saw nobody posted anything like here, wanted link karma. projecting anything, asking way discrimination employer requires site presence even precious little angel likes work home better lol. always productivity, physical presence required job even though management, work home peer level able cover physical hours. desire resume somewhat normal social life nothing capitalist machine presenteeism...  think would different knew going go year. job supposed shut two weeks. end two weeks everyone furloughed, industry one last come back full force. trying hang sense normalacy kept waiting see long would go seeing ever changing goalposts kept moving reopening farther farther away. I‚Äôd known beginning would year furlough job fully reopening would making different plans lot sooner. Quite far... already around 40% 1st dose think depending say 3rd wave startes, 2nd dose 2%. Today around 47% 1st dose, 7% 2nd dose. 3rd wave UK far, vaccine keeping everything control far we've constant lockdown since December countries relaxed restriction time period. struck court, unless US government wants business running private corporations telling private property. Isn‚Äôt word that? depressing see people downvote truth. I‚Äôm introverted, honestly really enjoyed first months quarantine, feeling like could actually get things done without sit traffic half day. awhile though, even started get ridiculously lonely started feeling like every day same. can‚Äôt imagine extroverts feel. one reasons don‚Äôt think international travel come back year large way. It‚Äôs currently mostly rich countries getting vaccinated developing countries may get access shot till 2022. 

Also, avoiding international travel provides level protection variants. Memes suddenly admitting 30 cases 7 deaths claiming weeks weeks EU problem? fact cases UK millions vaccinations given evidence prove something wrong reports EU countries.

These 30 cases happen yesterday. true. That‚Äôs vaccines work. CDC reported vaccine extremely low likelihood transmitting virus another person. like every vaccine works. funny enough survey im looking said 1 5 would get trump strongly urged take it, seems like whatever did, bare minimum enough, sums everything related pandemic lol basing yes, seen debunked. share source that? Genuinely interested. Got first dose Pfizer, besides bit sore arm feel great. Feeling relieved I‚Äôm one step closer end. Given people unable recieve vaccine, thats impossible scenario mood improved pandemic. annoyingly loud it, cases. extreme introvert anxiety family refuses acknowledge this.

Can relate, empathy.

Part family loves loud obnoxious get togethers, cant understand I'm always it. Ive heard too, surprised. ignorant? Even hero Trump told take vaccine. must think butts seat time actually leads productivity. Everything else said projection. True, though I'm sure got control recently! article says gener introverts enjoyed less socializing due covid enjoyed time 'actual' introverts. hard, actual introvert obviously mentally ill lol. also naturally introverted part, fucking **love** hanging friends bar, going shows, sporting events, theme parks, etc. 

This site often confuses *introvert* *severe social anxiety* IMO EU still demanding AZ clearly think good enough populace. agree racism. find odd coronavirus diseases labeled Middle East Respiratory Syndrome South Asia Respiratory Syndrome, COVID-19 location attached it. responsible that. Trillions dollars economic damage caused COVID-19. fully protected go it, like another guy said, restrictions would bothering you, know Mexico basically restrictions touristy places Dude board end lol far along vaccine-wise UK 3rd wave hit? point reference social media sites start providing free critical thinking tutorials. Maybe encapsulated kind catchy ""master class"" format engaging videos. could solve lot problems. lot people pick hear. described life perfectly proof words: English article google translator help you. Exactly. People right refuse vaccine want, businesses right want serve them. It‚Äôs simple one thinks - people want COVID vaccine CANNOT get it, especially UK. Yet treated akin anti-vax people. Basically, pro vax get vaccine great. pro vax CANNOT GET VACCINE screwed. anti vaccine anti vax, least restrictions choice. people really stupid. wear fake ""introversion"" love restrictions badge pride. discriminated do-nothing manager wants butts seats. Fuck that. 

I think know discrimination means. Nobody cares want hermit, pretend like world better everyone forced stay inside actually mentally ill tbh. go physically work discriminating anyone, vast majority workforce to; baffled think discrimination. Fantastic news! can't wait day world celebrates. Introvert here, seen mood improvements  experience felt worse day J&amp;J shot ever Covid. YMMV. stop spreading unsubstantiated rumors point none. arguing someone's attitude minor items dictate treated national media, why? 1. get vaccine?
2. enjoy vaccine?
3. credit card numbers day birth? Honestly think Michigan's cases surging one hardest ""lockdown"" states (if want call ""lockdown"") past year enough people got it, i.e. antibodies virus. We've mostly reopened past month (indoor dining, in-person schools sports). That's reason think cases surging. always wondered introverted successful become prolific personality trait, extroverts clearly advantage socialising, work culture dating culture.

Then pandemic hit, like OH, makes sense. imagine introverts fighting chance go spring break mask. Yeah whole thread embarrassing tbh. Like least really makes clear people still insisting life never even vaccinated point herd immunity, still avoid large gatherings mask fuck stay fuck home lol.  damn Im envious think getting there! monitoring situation looks like guys hit almost 14% 1st dose now, that's huge progress vs couple weeks ago. couple family too. ha, friend said exact thing. stoked got vaccine dolly think comes fact person either extroverted introverted, mix. Mankind based social interactions ability interact cohesively allowed us become Earth's apex predators. 

So think social important wellbeing people extent, everyone actually enjoys necessary exchange (introverts).  It‚Äôs honestly really nice see US well kicking ass vaccine front (compared Canada sucking wind) especially years shocked appalled America falling apart irreversible incompetency Trump years. Personally, feel world better place America succeeding... need friend ally strong back business! vaccines freely available buy make appointment them. COVID vaccine available everyone, UK anyway UK vaccine rollout failing. younger people want COVID vaccine living certain postcodes cannot get here. got 2nd Pfizer shot fortune cookie said ‚Äúyou gain new sense confidence month.‚Äù Seems legit once. get political, think lot people would‚Äôve continued protesting masks Trump administration become apathetic accepted November onward, since Biden built whole campaign national mask mandate. think super-majority county/region vaccinated (like 60%+) see outdoor mask mandates dropped, even cautious liberal states like California. Inside whole different scenario since venues screening vaccine passports. Traditionally vaccines much longer gaps, 3 months-3 years, outlandish decision. also benefit improving overall efficacy AZ vaccine, raising protection 80's, kept people hospital Pfizer variants here. Working home different topic social life. Variant means genetic set mutation original. Lineage even hip term thing. Strain implies biological difference, unknown lineages therefore frowned upon even lineages definitely strain, like B.1.1.7 (UK).

The dominant lineage varies across US. original highly contagious strain, B.1. (Wuhan), encompasses many mutations create lineage suspected basically - often called wild type, though Classic Strain good term too. includes D614G mutation first noticed last spring, proven actually anything.

B.1.427/B.1.429 (Los Angeles) lineage suspected (unproven) slightly contagious, highly prevalent large Los Angeles wave. since spread across good bit US, become dominant anywhere.

New York City strain, B.1.526, high prevalence provably different original. spread much elsewhere though.

In rest country mix ""wild type"" B.1.1.7. B.1.1.7 believed 50% contagious, meaning outgrow Classic Strain 50% per 5 days.

The strains substantially worrisome P.1. (Manaus), currently spreading across South America, P.2. (Rio) thing slower rate, B.1.351 (South Africa), completely took South Africa seems immune escape, never gotten foothold anywhere else. detected US, appear out-competed B.1.1.7 even though contradicts quickly took locations first identified.

There's also completely different naming system, B.1.1.7 called V1, B.1.351 V2, P.1 V3. provably different strains, worrisome have. time someone says ""variants problem"" mean three strains, V1 one measurable prevalence US. Everything I‚Äôve seen suggested this, missing? things claimed super trustworthy unbiased sources like ‚Äúlockdownskeptics‚Äù etc Good. introvert miss going bars. listen homebodies try paing introverts complete shut ins.

There huge difference taking time alone sometimes forced home time option. think first paragraph bit misleading. vaccines prevented hospitalizations deaths even older. People fully vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt afraid travel vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% effective. vaccines 100% effective really shouldn‚Äôt used argument. virus isn‚Äôt bad warrant vaccine

This really brazen coming employees high risk places wife get second dose Wednesday, youngest daughter, still lives us, got first shot yesterday. son daughter-in-law first dose oldest daughter sadly anti-vaxxer. One scientists' concerns vaccine rollout started early slow. Production always bottleneck. actual jabs arms never bottleneck. Even start jabbing May, would end total number people vaccinated June. could easily vaccinate 6 times many people one month.

There many benefits stockpiling vaccines give around mid 2021:

* problem diminishing immunity prior infections early vaccine recipients

* Less time spent rollout reaching herd immunity means less time virus mutate selective pressure vaccine-resistant variants.

* false sense security leading premature cancelling safety measures

* Allows time long-term safety data come clinical trial

We made mistake starting vaccination early. say that's case, salty nationalists seemingly hark back wistfully days 1000s dying UK daily basis exist, they're vocal minority. good news threads well countries. change story. say like government-issued piece paper either. MS caused virus? thought genetic. UK living hill used AstraZenica vaccinate country lower death rate level seen since end first wave. 

I think Europe America learn UK UK learn countries. I‚Äôm happy keep wearing mine everyone vaccinated. assume get close everyone liberalize (I.e 80% people vaccine - indoor dining maybe drop masks). Good, fuck extroverts! China ***VIRUS***. variant.

Where people hearing things like this?

Everyone keeps complaining narrative end pandemic always ‚Äútwo weeks‚Äù away, never lead believe case. hope Canada turns corner soon! I've always wanted visit UK. remember NYT article presented like borderline criminal idea. many competent immunologist saying perfectly fine given situation. Freaking sweet comparing idea national ID thought private businesses wanting operate see fit based safety clients? said vaccine cards stored centrally businesses require it? hard make rule, allow high risk businesses (ie retirement homes, hospice) require tread lightly know disease? don‚Äôt consider extroverted mental health plunged. keep mind vaccine 100% effective. 40 even get covid worse cold, senior someone pre-existing conditions could complications. Remember even Israel huge % population already inoculated still covid deaths among vaccinated. 

The main worry would required negative test get return flight test positive? Could afford time &amp; expense quarantine Costa Rica another 10 14 days? sucks. admit, US dog shit pandemic, fucking rocking vaccine rollout. Imagine channelled competence start. only. old projections, find projections US EU expected finish vaccination Q4 late Q3 months back. find projections vaccine available 2020 go even bit back. Naw excuses. LA county, model good governance mind you, following lockstep state. LA county 1C weeks opened vaccines 50 plus week. Chicago Illinois horrible vaccine rollout start Describe discriminated situation. physically incapable getting free vaccine physically can't get tested COVID alternative, obviously physically can't go concert. Tell victim detail. sound angry. mean say challenge it. percentage efficacy? saw screenshot Texas governor's tweet announcing Texas 100% open, thought novelty account first. mean, look way says ""EVERYTHING"" like  think vaccinating kids soon enough. get obese there... although much similar educational level; actually affects covid... biology. higher concentration vaccine vial think, basically RNA Right, well, bartending exactly pandemic proof. job is.

Without sharing needless details, made clear I'm going lose job, kind work can't replaced someone works less another country. Granted, I've worked home years prior this, going either. Work trips there, yes, working office? happening. No. HIV status disclosure issue two private parties government role dictating. exception laws prohibiting intentional malicious transmission, laws criminalizing HIV repealed. think exactly right. People accustomed science ready ahead time care enough consider it. 

Now literally experiencing science happens. also means experiencing missteps revisions occur learn more. US options selfishly decided keep productions itself, that's it. ""Yeah, never wore mask, never got microchip, never got hoax virus, everyone idiots"". counter point places anything set like that, left business, businesses want people asap without dealing making sure people vaccinated.

Most businesses say job police vaccinations, government policing them, leaves people to, likely effective broad sense.

Furthermore, even new york guarantee lot places bother reach mass vaccination. public stomach vaccine passport, reach point businesses throw requirement one.

Doesn't feel like lot money thrown something likely abandoned matter months? people breaking restrictions sub attracting maniacs like lol, bye bye then? point, fuck anti-vaxxers. say everyone wants one gets one, cno vaccine, medical treatment. Let problem solve itself. we're getting near demand limit vaccinates already Alaska bode well rest country Yeah, stop that. Go science. worried slight uptick cases. Vaccines opening ages makes number go next couple weeks. Expats supposed people plan go back home country. settled permanently.

In practice turned white english speakers expats everyone else immigrant regardless.  learn new word today? Thank you.. everyone else hear shames express sort vaccine hesitation &amp; concern it‚Äôs terrible. Exactly happened Well vaccination elderly, deadly well. YES.

How convince free rider re: herd immunity?
My attorney brother(50) person.
My parents (81/76) fully vaccinated husband (50) soon be.

My brother actually asked elderly parents Easter. WTF?!? going future...
as father really family oriented father may cave see free rider brother.
Thanks!!! would probably smiled ignored you. Much less Cuomo has. governors, according death rate numbers. üôÑ  possibly dumbest thing ever? made claim it‚Äôs dangerous, laid data indicating otherwise. proof *wont* *cant* happen.

Every single one 226 kids died absolute tragedy. Unfortunately though, discuss public policy society make determination safety vs. freedom. could regulate away tens thousands deaths occur every year, don‚Äôt would allow people live lives. 

If feel restrictions &amp; precedent requiring medical information basic things like attend baseball game worth saving, say, 100 lives (number drop heavily vaccinated adult population anyways), get it. go path reassess risk calculation make aspects society well. Permanent mask mandate public places indefinitely? It‚Äôll save way 100 lives/year even COVID over. 

(And don‚Äôt even think trying *gotcha* thing seatbelts. safety improvement:restriction ratio massively different)  ALSO PROVIDE NEGATIVE TEST. literally percentage population get it, GO ANYWAY sick. completely wrong here. exactly zero evidence far vaccines work variants. Go check south coast plaza mean absolutely disrespect could person simultaneously able attend event concert sporting event unable get vaccine, many done drive thrus falls ""Not Even Wrong"" category. ""The vaccine operating system"" even truth-value. combination words actually mean anything. ""edit: downvotes objective fact, subreddit turned trash heap anti-science goons""

Agreed. There's lot Mod enforcement lot anti-mask nnn freaks tend troll here.  Report want, literally addressed insane claim ableist private enterprise requireproof vaccination negative test large event directly, literally nothing stand on. ever read effect high herd immunity vaccination influenza antigenic drift? stability avian H5N2 HA vaccination campaigns Mexico? 

This induced targeted selective pressure. less likely escape events whole virus/bacteria targeted vaccines single proteins/peptides (or two case influenza vaccine). natural infection, get mutation, chances mutation within RBM site low compared mutations throughout SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome (which see massive amounts mutation within RBD/RBM despite millions natural infection). But, induce immunity particular targeted antigen (in case RBD/RBM NTD spike), drive antigenic drift region subsequent escape. 
 
This really new concept... telling people physically unable something they're allowed attend events ableist know would classify ableist. Im huge introvert Pre covid didnt want plan said 

 
""no cant sry""

Thats hard?. making excuses addicted restrictions. big difference making less plans able anything stay home. Covid general higher death rate influenza. Across age groups, except young children possibly. infect people even fully vaccinated symptoms. Last week case surge Germany hospital shows possible scenario. literally misusing adverb ""literally"" mean opposite. increased severity well infectiousness people acting like ok go maskless people vaccinated. Vaccines exert force field. People vaccinated work. Society whole need minunum % vaccinated stop outbreaks &amp; keep one two people.

also study released organ transplant patients rarely produced antibodies vaccination. tests starting see immunosuppresants others like autoimune decrease response. hope least good response &amp; scientists figure way protect organ transplant patients continue hunker down. honest, considered introvert I'm quite surprised results. figured even introverts need *some* social interaction. mental health definitely dropped pandemic. Maybe I'm introverted thought British would use study 95% CI 0-100% contradict another 95% CI, 87 98.

Because British experts trustworthy....

/s pandemic (particularly discourse Reddit it) actually made pretty ashamed someone kinda introverted 

Dunking extroverts missing joys socializing live sterilized zoom life, mental illness skyrockets country, always felt pretty fucking ghoulish me. left knee too. lying bed earlier night almost worried ZERO side effects either shot outside smallest shoulder pain possible. wake go restroom knee frozen stiff bend hurts sooo bad tried bending it. 5 minutes slowly stretching got loose went back bed. people experienced prolonged amount time feel sorry cause rough. yes, happy see another person got well cause talked anyone else got side effect.  either.

I'll gladly accept risk covid, sign away place hospital would let me. saying vaccine unsafe others take it. refuse test even minute chance. thought possibly getting screwed society actively despise worth me.

That's works. üò¢ never book flu shots advance, I‚Äôve always walked asked one. Congrats, start vaccinating Palestinians whose land occupying Alright, well I‚Äôm hoping you‚Äôre right. I'm guessing posts limited negative net karma sub - that's happened subs occasionally. yellow fever card already required travel certain countries. Corona handled differently? that's media say variant location name instead lazy reporting (saying UK variant instead Variant B.1.1.7 least variant B.1.1.7, discovered UK) and/or reporters knowing people can't keep track naming numbers?

and i'm sure nothing fact certain people power blaming one country disease time saying harmless magically disappear using country's name insult absolutely effect anything all. fact racists using excuse beat vandalize property people who's ancestors came country influence reluctance. name cases people beat british, brazillian south african descent virus strains?  Maybe ambivert don‚Äôt. one misinformed introversion. ""true introvert"" homebody.

I textbook introvert: smaller groups, shy, need time alone, also nihilistic ideas hate biological life (thats another topic) yet find insulting deem introvert depressed covid life fake. 

There fucking big difference introspective person loking sometimes time alone fine able literally anything outside home. friends texting past year year suspect know I've used pandemic lifestyle many, many years now. people facebook stopped liking posts apparently they're kinda jealous I've happier I've (or I've told). Someone likely try argue either it‚Äôs discrimination based medical condition religious belief.

They might win, costs $20 file lawsuit. variant tracking page cases identified based sampling SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens represent total number B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 lineage cases may circulating...

Unfortunately, testing variants anywhere near many cases Britain.   Michigan bad. 9000 cases today poorer countries. state (FL) banned distribution vaccine passports, get vaccine passport travel abroad see family now? Believe total doses. ~100MM first + 60MM second Vaccines work crap ton people get that‚Äôs it‚Äôs important.  Case numbers great metric. hospitalizations deaths decreasing secondary covid 19, much better metric. Anecdotal, paramedic central Connecticut deathly ill covid patient nearly 2 months heavy virus patients since december 2019. It‚Äôs fucking selfish Way soon *what*. It‚Äôs HIPPA violation. Darwinized herd thinning. Guilt mainly. Sometimes want something feel like it. rare though constantly forced things keep connection live sucks. constantly perfect excuse. 

Also, like hanging people sometimes, want hang party. party. 

Also masks nice. Yeah, sister pretty much lost two weeks initial quarantine, super worrying extremely lucky never got covid whenever snuck things (she wear mask probably improved odds favor). lead lot clashes, since super strict following quarantine guidelines need seek others company like does. Speaking anecdotally, I've great time.  Normally feel pangof guilt going involved. play video games, watch TV, I've taken painting. I'm even socializing people I'veatched dating apps. life me. Hell yeah #2. I'm introvert learned act extroverted means hate talking humans, hence I'm here. I'm really drained petty drama. Things like making small talk takes lot effort. part pandemic relaxing point actually really want get socialize finally with. Like drained battery recharged. ‚ÄúIn couple months‚Äù sure, yet. That‚Äôs saying. Yeah, rewlly hope keep introversion normalized shit finally subsides Since posted source favor masks, could also share says don‚Äôt anything? Well, old people get vaccinated first, see lot young(er) people get angry this. First lockdown minimal risk covid young people (so protect old people) old people get vaccinated first allowed things app young people still can't???

An app like great idea *once everyone chance get vaccine* probably even bother come back vengenace anyway. Dude's though hell back last several years. think he's planning retire enjoy happy, peaceful retirement life family. sure ppl think anywhere going avoid friend also 30s got hit hard first dose second one mostly made sleepy, she‚Äôs trying figure exposed Covid last year seems unlikely given tons interactions fact one family friends got it. agree careful little long everybody chance receive full course vaccine can't see received one anti-maskers. 27 days, April 30th, Biden's 100th day.

**Very** interested seeing says ""100 days masks"" come day. chilean study released information saying 90% population vaccinated everyday still actually case. ‚ÄúShots arms‚Äù say, mean fully vaccinated. We're going gathering Sunday feel comfortable I'm person ""half vaccinated"". no, introverts prefer usually smaller groups time alone time time, social isolation. stop inventing stuff. appointment 1130am tomorrow morning get first pfizer dose. 30, male, NY resident. family lives california month away entire family vaccinated. seen 2 years. Looking forward better, safer, days. Read. The. Article. Before. You. Respond. working office, likely reason can't continue work home except management's insecurity it. Many big Silicon Valley companies (Google, Salesforce, etc) joining ""Work Anywhere"" movement spending years trying keep employees campus, still lot pointy-haired bosses believe anyone works without watching or, worse, mere presence ""inspires"" somehow.

I've telecommuting full-time 11 years would never go back. 65-70% company also telecommuted closing office last year big deal. many remotes across \~40 states, people office already used working virtually us anyways. real change client meetings virtual too. think elderly (80 up) willing usually remember things like polio measles outbreaks vaccine drives 50s. Baby boomers think invincible It‚Äôs huge invasion privacy. Certain people trying use opportunity punish unwilling unable want do. vaccinated, shouldn‚Äôt care people choose do. It‚Äôs fault problem choose public get sick. make vaccine passports star shape. Think staples Office Depot free laminating keep saying blue face, going change fact people done soon get vaccinated.

In next couple months, everyone chance get vaccine, give fuck spreading virus anyone else feel like getting vaccine. Life going back normal someone gets get vaccinated, that's them. prevent infection 95% transmission another 95%? works?

Your ‚Äòabsolutely‚Äô, ‚Äònear‚Äô ‚Äòinsanely‚Äò definitely different mine, that‚Äôs sure. think fully vaccinated good go. majority demographic 65% people going die Covid much higher rate flu. introvert began upswing mood crashing hard nearly year. Us introverted people also need small selected moments social behaviour keep quota up.. it‚Äôs like hard crash long recovery understand possibilities, realisitcally, close regrowing teeth we? 2 years away? 10 years away? reports miracle cures seemingly everyday, mRNA vaccine worked covid layman seems realistic cures diseases reach, cannot understand close really realizing that. CLEARLY follow guidelines. extremely possible drank, kisses, hugged, etc. Rolling average went last 30 days, implying R~1.48 time period (based 5 day serial interval). kinda pisses off. Everybody saying ‚Äúwait Easter 2021 gather‚Äù it‚Äôs like 2020 again. way easy now. think demand starting fall, least area. way soon that. Everything talks B.1.1.7 etc ""variants"". current dominant strain virus ""variants"" displacing? current dominant strain originate from? Don‚Äôt project insecurities world, deal like (yes, everyone insecurities).  really wondered one‚Äôs reaction shot connection would‚Äôve reacted virus. say science behind curiosity. hope usa reaches 100 2 months isn‚Äôt true. stops overwhelming majority getting get milder case. least get facts right. Funny people voter ID ‚Äúvaccine passports.‚Äù

Fortunately, consistent both. Lots states moving 16+ helped. find insane city 16+ getting it, find appointments time want one. like people think vaccine existing enough, actually get it. course mask mandates went away, university removing restrictions well. Sadly yeah. residents nursing home vaccinated. half staff chose get it. 

Some reasons I've heard nurses want it: think sterilize them, never get vaccinations get one, virus bad warrant vaccine, government sketchy. people get sick Rose Garden event even though outside? remember someone saying messes hair purpose shit Online school awful me. 

I hands trade school type program. teachers tried, lot phoning in. Yup. whole people-dying-of-a-virus thing sucks, I'm absolutely enjoying working home 100% wish part would continue. What's latitude? Parts Colorado could fall number depending. already international standard proof vaccinated reason create virtual passport abused spy you. Trump Bolsonaro? conduct worldwide poll over. likely included existing yellow card. opening ages makes number go next couple weeks.

If vaccinated 60-70% people now, would agree.

Unfortunately, 50% country either virus vaccinated. variants ticking time bomb. B117 surging Michigan unfortunately think moving worst period pandemic date. Thanks, interesting, that's Moderna. Pfizer vaccine designed Biontech CEO weekend virus code first published. Hmm. Let re-read That's legally binding document.

No, can't find part said okay. show says that? Think state restrictions left. Yep, 90% white collar workers. Gotta tell you, I‚Äôm investment management industry MBA, automation 100x concerning outsourcing is. post dookie, give workers time back. Yeah, 5% chance contracting still there, 95% decreased symltomology pretty damn good. That‚Äôs tough sell me, appreciate you‚Äôre logically consistent. cdc:

No data available establish COVID-19 vaccine safety efficacy groups. Thank much this! hold breath date. could strains US similar effects. I'm wrong certainly happy. Thanks that? Genuinely asking, know much amendment granting citizenship everyone born US also former slaves Yes definitely. meetings 2 days (got sat morning, meetings Monday morning) really regretted finding sub. find someone last minute much harder. PEOPLE THINKING ... SHORT MEMOROES ... SELFISH ... PAY ATTENTION SCIENCE ...  believe Dr Fauci many experts wrong waves coming. Variants surges cases ensure matter many people vaccinate, always swamped virus.

The possible way avoid death control virus stay home. Permanently.

Even economy takes nosedive, think choice much black white scenario: Lock harder ever before, thus permeating social isolation society, go die virus.

No sensible person could possibly imagine ""post COVID"" world. Trust say that, vaccine vaccine, can't simply learn live virus infectious ubiquitous. Whatever restrictions lifted country now, last long. lockdown cycle- words, New Normal.

Thus, vaccine completely ineffective long run. ""adapt die"" scenario. believe we're permanently stuck crisis, I'm afraid much falsely hopeful. antibodies likely fine. Well Covid, would've actually research finding job could done home. Thanks Covid's trial-by-fire work-from-home, know. lingering fear E484K mutation would rip vaccines. Looks like we‚Äôre protected pandemic end. Thank Pfizer! FINNALY able secure appointment next Friday first shot April 30th second!!!!

Almost there... Hopefully get banned repeatedly breaking rules..... didn‚Äôt end well her.

Poor Lily :-( total faith argument. don‚Äôt understand is. Nobody physically unable get shot Probably still first. Damn jerry! Ah right, makes okay then. You: Acts like complete fucking idiot gets disproven literally every time try make point. 

Also you: Wow called fucking idiot, guess win. Lightfoot really everything one term mayor, huh? figure closing demand? Nothing post indicates that. Actually expecting people social interaction people outside household whole YEAR delusional. Probably limiting indoors inter-household gathering much reasonably possible shaming going park something insane. Since Fauci expect Fox fearmongering nonstop coming 4th wave. It‚Äôs one areas Biden power impose mask mandate - traveling across state lines! knew one Chinese vaccines used ‚Äútraditional‚Äù method didn‚Äôt realize much slower thing. Frankly, still wearing masks time. definitely visiting foreign countries without mask many years virus around mutations occurring every day. Yeah chance reinfection tiny. unlikely would make worse point going really interesting see happens single young people summer comes threat subsides.

I personally think going see lot new ""relationships"" start randos meet dating aps public places booze like concerts bars. They'll effectively one night stands drawn course weeks neither partner wants stop bedroom activity done year. Think short term relationship 100% predicated sex. wonder administrators using 11 doses entire time something new It‚Äôs actually forbidden export vaccines ingredients USA. It‚Äôs basically country world that. yes, it‚Äôs basically definition selfishness, quite ironic beacon free markets. That's legally binding document. used CVS. easy. tried state signup beforehand, unqualified disaster. felt like Geocities site 90‚Äôs; listed websites could use, links sites, instead actual information. yeah fuck garbage. crashed world economy disease truly worse flu UNLESS RETIREMENT AGE. 

how long expect young people keep sacrificing sake who've lived lives? plenty opportunity get vaccinated now. Ok 20% remaining risk still 1/5 original risk still pretty bad, especially something infectious Covid. Actually varies greatly state lot times private establishments make rules. bars allow kids others don't. theme parks stricter others term allow on. I've civil conversation. can't defend point view without insults must much faith argument. received Moderna part 2! Makes little sense okay also think people inclined public shaming great picking high risk behaviors. I've seen lot social media shaming people park/going beach/skiing seems like good way encourage people socialize inside private. 

And I've seen one person sub suggest getting positive covid test sign must irresponsible, misses everybody work person, act caretaker family members, use public transit. Shaming people getting sick culture want create. got mine got excess dose vaccination location I‚Äôve volunteering while. wife tried volunteer well, weren‚Äôt open new volunteers (I‚Äôve volunteering year), finally approved ‚Äúdeployment‚Äù got shifts scheduled even got ‚Äúdeployed‚Äù able schedule vaccination. She‚Äôs still volunteering course, timing made us laugh, also made sense. True. Asshole mayor hates poor black people. Exactly, people getting way excited May even July. Masks around 1-2 years even give fuck vaccinated there's exposure found. Variants booster shots going policy mess, travel interstate definitely international fucked least year more. 

What people back yards outside florida texas summer fun bars, masks indoors till next year easily. would explain poor rollout Europe. Probably GDPR compliant. Seems legit? Aye, still lottery ticket new emergent variant. statistically improbable. Man family myself, gf, mom 3000 miles away ever going get vaccinated.
My 3 roommates refuse. sister bf refuse. dad refuses. I'm surrounded idiots anecdotal. diabetes, got doses moderna shot, light stomach cramping 24 hours after, better. vaccinated January. I'm still here. yearly I'm healthy. Long term effects vaccines show within 2 months administration. past window visited family friends year full isolation. One friends COVID recent visit. found called me. quarantined tested. Guess what?  COVID. wear mask either. vaccines work people issues living life doom scrolling reddit posting severe anecdotal stories. person need talk vaccine doctor. vaccinated yet? Anything less full capacity masks vaccinated unacceptable.

And vaccine passports/required testing. Thank you, well said! expression *per se It‚Äôs happening areas it‚Äôs less noticeable at-risk demographics fully vaccinated time now.  must aware completely make something up, did, order find positive trump regarding pandemic means Trump totally screwed pandemic. 

I mean, aren‚Äôt sort agreeing me? parents received shots (mom 7 days since dose 2 Pfizer). got first dose Wednesday. comfortably visit weekend? even still go Negative test lmao like it‚Äôs completely 100% discriminatory way Holy fish paste, that‚Äôs incredible. government sets rules establishments well, numbnuts Maybe artifact brain wired conspiracy theories.  something sucks assume intent make suck.

I think also little revealing, like confession power would totally try make life suck certain people can. Speak yourself, lightweight! UN Declaration Human Rights perfect, Article 12 seems like pretty good one shall subjected arbitrary interference privacy, family, home correspondence, attacks upon honour reputation. Everyone right protection law interference attacks.

When we've arrived point we're dictating businesses they're allowed engage commerce basis everyone said transaction must share medical information, there's plausible pretense followed. People old 109, cancer patients, people physical disabilities, people dementia seen get shots. truly can‚Äôt think anyone can‚Äôt, someone sick might die...but wouldn‚Äôt going club anyway insane me. People saying big deal.

It's completely unacceptable young healthy people die vaccine. Private businesses setting rules establishment government telling spaces allowed exist two separate things. think lot us expecting mid May indoor performances.

Honestly, expect mid-May anyways. logistics sorted out, people actually set events get everything order actually perform. aren‚Äôt considered emigrant America unless officially renounce citizenship. Barring new dominant variant would us winning shittiest lottery, correct. Kinda, problem date supply demand. They‚Äôre moving demand phase messaging. didn‚Äôt want people running around pretending vaccinated avoid public health guidance still effect. Ahh texas. Never change. Low risk key. specifically gather indoors unvaccinated people age **one household** (for example, visiting relatives live together) without masks staying 6 feet apart, **unless people anyone live increased risk severe illness mine  proud of? Lmao roommates company (software) going require. He's one roughly half move away.

Starting September company going requiring one week office month. ZERO exceptions unless sick.

It's simple previous comment stated. Five women symptoms getting vaccine ""clearly"" show link vaccine. That's whole point. 


But think agree simple. Gonna close whether finish flat compared last week. It‚Äôs completely different point pandemic. didn‚Äôt vaccines, okay. them, month deaths continue free fall, along infections hospitalizations. way look front us. often, rarely public shaming work

I get shamed plenty locals area (normally teen's) playing pokemon go believe ""kids/baby game""

if person shamed truely believes nothing wrong, ignore shamers easily

don't waste time shaming others, never worth it, often get toxic rarely hostile That's true ""Memorial day lit"" bullshit. We'll nice backyard fun people, that's it. Masks indoor restrictions going away much later.

Wow, early... interesting interview Andreas Greinacher, discovered blood clots forming: interview German much detailed text video.

I hope, get major points right:

* Covid-19 much dangerous recommends get AZ shots, chance (there 40 cases thrombosis 1.4 million vaccinated people Germany compared 45 active Covid-19 hospital Greifswald alone)
* eyes connection AZ shots cases thrombosis proven
* team many professionals Germany &amp; Europe currently looking cause
* know cause compares searching needle haystack
* many speculations what's causing problem: maybe vector vaccine itself, maybe patients special genetic traits taken medicines
* moment nobody knows cause is, thus tests vaccination
* two things rules causes, common would've resulted many cases thrombosis
  * birth control pills
  * Faktor V Leiden mutations
* developed two tests check, antibodies currently causing blood clots patients, unfortunately work problems started
* vaccinated patients show symptoms thrombosis, get treatment immediately tests need help, anyone ease mind. I'm staying quarantine since 6th march (my father tested positive) showed symptoms slightly 16th march (cough, sore throat, full nose loss smell, nothing besides that). symptoms went away less week. test positive can't even go take walk nature without negative antigen test, go get tested (antigen) tomorrow (4th April) likely I'll positive? almost month since I've last outside room, feel like I'll go crazy I'll next 2 weeks.

I don‚Äôt remember enough AP Statistics calculate confidence interval, sticks out.

Caveats know could work argument, there‚Äôs probably more:

Hit em hurts, pocket books. alreayd 3rd wave? hear this. 

My parents pulling 80 something grandma old age home home visit Easter ... one vaccinated.

I taking non vaccinated self, school age children see them. Despite asserting don‚Äôt care get covid. 

Okay - *I* care. would traumatic children think could possibly reason Grannies death. 

Like ....... fuck sales. 

I taking True. Im happy government finally got shit together. can't wait either! We're getting second Pfizer next Weds. sounds like tough situation family. hope guys figure out. parents would trust efficacy vaccine (the point allow go back normal life) totally understand trepidation someone family acting irresponsibly. hard parents adult siblings bc ultimately adults make decisions....but sometimes make wrong one :( best you! mean, universities require proof vaccination attend many jobs require work, isn‚Äôt new outrageous idea. pssst! nobody tell happening michigan! Yeah, entire life put hold year.

I would say lucky never one lose point, think quiet contempt quite matches feelings towards people like you. little commissar wannabe*.* maybe need testing wastewater areas figure actual levels catch astymptomatic cases people afraid get tested allowed work kids parents test allowed school... prefer us selling cost (especially wealthier countries). US tax payers take hit? poorer countries definitely see charity aspect.  Might pandemic next time.

My father scientist husband sciences we've acting responsibly, really understand brother's (attorney 51) pov. can't wait get vaccine!!!

Illinois, Chicago area trouble keeping up, downstate many openings. could counted yet. things take time get accurate data.

UK originally said 5 cases already upped safe assume uncounted cases there. still early stages, could also nothing end. wait see.

Here Canada's statement quote couple numbers. 1:1,000,000 clots Germans claiming 1:100,000. 40% mortality rate.

I think primary concern likelihood among women 55 seems like would much much higher. thought opened everyone April 5th get vax, aint wearin maks Yikes - *choice* everyone wants vaccine US get it, not? vaccines work variants doesn‚Äôt matter spreads here. rate you‚Äôre liable get good chunk AZ we‚Äôre gonna need got two feel fre smooch me. Omg wish friends getting married wedding go year! would fun! white privilege I‚Äôve hearing much about? think average person higher paying job, requiring higher level education, smarter average janitor?

Or think there's correlation someone's IQ ability make something like medical school higher education?

I say that's classist, fact. allowed give vaccinations spouses caregivers normally qualify healthcare Veterans Affairs, removing one bottlenecks getting everyone vaccinated asap - lack qualified vaccinators. get that. dont think worth society let people fly Brazil see family come bring Brazil covid variant USA.

Don‚Äôt worry spooky variants!!! I've never pissed living Canada What's ""open""? 

&lt; Everyone 16+ wants vaccine fully vaccinated month point

Rofl masks work people want wear them? approved vaccines effective known variants

*less* effective original strains, also *known* current variants. going wait every last human vaccinated open up

""We're""? Every state make choices give fuck think, obviously. New York state even recognizing vaccine effective past 90 days per CDC guidelines lack long term data. policy standard quarantine rules 90 days last dose moment. 

You're completely naive think level masking travel restrictions persist fall probably end year. two things rules causes, common would've resulted many cases *  birth control pills

What mean, ""would have"" resulted many cases? already small percentage get blood clots birth control first place. Could normal rate blood clots unrelated vaccine?  Yeah, I'll flying visit dad us girlfriend fully vaccinated, seen year. I'll still masked traveling think that's actually rule still US domestic airlines probably airports (with varying degrees compliance airports, imagine). Ah yes giving priority former current military retired workforce people

The fuck? give shot dick, Nothing stop guilty conscience Don‚Äôt jinx sister sounds lot like yours! I‚Äôm finally going see weeks reason. Whew Newsom ate dinner restaurant. Cuomo sexually assaulted multiple women. 

Newsom idiot really boat got doses (late Jan late Feb) thru Mega-Clinic hosted county public health agency South Texas. gave different cards time, like one ~2 inches shorter other. think either one CDC logos etc

No big deal tho. keep second one folded wallet case anybody asks (nobody yet). plus phone foto case showing one somehow convince (shrug emoji) - Tests: 1,683,615 - Cases: 65,599 - Deaths: 944 - Currently Hospitalized: 37,311 - Currently ICU: 7,050 (+/- compared day last week Tests/Cases/Deaths &amp; yesterday Hosp/ICU)

Source: - appears cases didn‚Äôt rekey due holiday weekend. See thread cases bit volatile couple weeks. Hospitalizations &amp; ICU numbers pretty accurate. U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! actually know ""maximum"" immunity attainted easy gather data. said either 7 14 days fine points consider protected. guys sent us 1.5million AstraZeneca shots, awesome, one wants take (IMO overblown) blood clot scare. 

Thank goodness conservative government saved money ‚Äò90s eliminating domestic vaccine manufacturing! ? Really.

You think fact take issue news article acting like Marvel film children trying talk smart?!  France, third lockdown 4 weeks.
+ curfew 7pm. What? I'm trying 'right' downvotes getting. Gotta trust science try avoid media more. understand hesitation. Listen experts politicians. Talk doctor go get shot! great! They‚Äôre also hook costs medical care (NHS). That‚Äôs economic incentives work. Fauci fraud think much depends business. businesses hole occupancy limits social distancing, people perceive patronizing potentially dangerous. knowledge everyone movie theatre restaurant--staff, customers, etc.--is provably vaxxed end increasing business making scared people feel safe? Remains seen, think fairly likely. fact, think possible see used selling point--""you go restaurant street take chances, come restaurant know safe."" 

As public stomach vaccine passport: run performing arts business involves gathering large amount people together. I've gotten three emails customers far *begging* require proof vaccination, otherwise they're out. 

I agree months, probably matter. Everyone vaccinated, numbers drop passports important anymore. then? think might go long way making people safer making *feel* safer.  someone (mostly) follows CDC guidelines, I've traveled year.

When get 2 weeks past second shot, though, I'll mask fly visit dad finally. know CDC make laws, I'm Georgia governor give flip people regards virus, like knowing whether things judged low high risk scientists know. Brace impact 4-6p, closer 4 possible. agree. Also financially sound put concert reduced capacity, expect we'll seeing many concerts right capacity upped. Well, rate seems low wonder around normal percentage women get blood clots birth control. Hold beer said America. Fuck really hope guys get vaccinated soon, fast we‚Äôre vaccinating imagine we‚Äôll position help neighbors north soon enough.  Except articles poorer nations saying COVAX similar vaccine donors simply donate vaccines leave sitting docks, theres way administer medical personnel lacking. many cases, donations vaccine simply window dressing Yeah so? didn‚Äôt expect first one either. Oh snap! Thanks background. know invested like that.  sound like kind person tries talk smart time prove people you‚Äôre doing. Kinda lame insecure. gotta say, I'm looking forward return business travel. 12-15 trips year week less, I'm hoping even fewer going forward people realized meetings remotely fine. Reason.

But hey go cry pipeline something Herd immunity doesn‚Äôt require 100% compliance. people counter indicated vaccination, immuno-compromised deathly allergic vaccine adjuncts. Perhaps shunning people death isn‚Äôt great idea. This.

It's badge honor dragging sick self work.

_Stay home_

However, require changes employers regarding sick leave. natural extension logic people without money inherently stupid? Seems little reductive classist. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 70 years olds race vulnerable 18 year old First Nations. Agreed, ridiculous. Texting emojis brought world 3rd grade reading level. 

My favorite articles say ""because course would 2020?!?!"" reference something negative happening. think college students superspreaders? seen Miami pics? mask found. Availability. countries I'm aware specifically /won't/ ask residency citizenship getting appointment, best interest best interest country simply vaccinate many people possible there.

However, countries simply enough thr vaccine, limits numbers. I'll back USA next week hoping get vaccine ASAP there. don‚Äôt know many places can‚Äôt get testing appt ,if day of, next day  flip flops American tourist Florida. I'm trying defeatist manage expectations people think we'll back normal July. Helllll no.

Why would US open July? Everyone 16+ wants vaccine fully vaccinated month point. VaRiAnTs valid reason latest data shows 3 approved vaccines effective known variants. Children 16? risk serious disease death close zero. We're going wait every last human vaccinated open up. lol relax Thank you, behalf us Ah! Maybe hes finally admitted theyre using many cycles PCR tests? Ok negative rapid test, think fine Anyone says know operating system is. even make sense. makes think may it? Came angry comment made day üòÇ  many people died car accidents way get shot? came infected animal, probably bat. figured ago. true. Science messaging historically bad relatively hard. 

But specifically talking OP said, regards Fauci changing messaging he's flip flopping. That's case. here, I'm literally trying good citizen limit spread virus. Messaging huge issue. Instead talking things vaccinated, news focused things still shouldn‚Äôt do. lot people saying what‚Äôs point? people aren‚Äôt correct, messaging focused could got shot. news also better job hammering fact sooner get people vaccinated, sooner stop wearing masks social distancing. someone engineer complete scratch? non science fiction explanation that? Therefore must come previous virus, therefore even engineered, variety previous virus, thus variant. Highly highly unlikely. would need another round? virus mutate strains (which takes decades), might require annual boosters, there's every indication vaccines effective long started testing. great way cause vaccine passports. Stop suggesting brother NEVER see dad again? Like ever? looking advice convince brother? problem asking fully vaccinated people Easter? PCR test give 80% false positive, fake like passport. would've nothing worry previous ""P""OTUS actively sabotage country's response pandemic. also 100% sure unmasked vaxxers might still contribute viral spread. I'm vaxxed know I'm sick spread covid. know long might contagious getting symptoms testing positive. headline says variant killing people fastER youngER relative original covid. never said many young people (35 lower) dying going die. Also 50% death rate increase huge considering virus also spreads quickly. Relative original covid, variant much worse, point article trying make. Thank you. 

The hardest thing ever done clean apartment pack life. Great question, I'm afraid know. people like intentionally traveling waiting vaccination  son 30, medical conditions. vaccination sites near always hundred doses left due open stock. can't put back use lose it. gets second shot next week. got link? know origin anything know variant another virus? thought established virus new humans year ago.  look yourself.

so thats no? thanks letting know full shit. 30.7% Americans received one dose more, 13.7% Canadians falling category yesterday. 

Given Canada ramped giving first doses 0.5%+ population every day, US terms previously mentioned metric around 30 days. sure Biden isn‚Äôt forcing Fauci say this?

Just kidding, Biden wants asses live. know even repubs. study 2 shots discrimination 1940 Slow there, leave pessimism rest us. bf may covid got 1st dose. got first dose Wednesday, he‚Äôs getting tested tomorrow, someone job said tested positive covid today.

When got first dose, bit cough sniffles, fever loss taste/smell, figured allergies. So, did/does covid, mild symptoms.

If it, going basically cancel first dose? vaccine still work? get another dose? got Moderna, btw, matters. 

My thinking would natural antibodies antibodies vaccine, that‚Äôs assumption. obese triples chances hospitalized covid. run situation ICUs overwhelmed could treat patients, obese person absolutely would lead deaths others. Thankfully see situation, necessarily always zero cost others.  Got moderna today, arm received shot felt little numb muscle twitching. hope that‚Äôs normal üòÇ No, you‚Äôre right - data beginning show effectiveness vaccines variants. comment admittedly vague. 

I‚Äôm mostly referring lot learn still effectiveness vaccines variants. I‚Äôve read promise - produce reduced immune response. can‚Äôt assume effective variants COVID need remain vigilant safety precautions too. socially awkward person somewhat bittersweet: I‚Äôm still awkward AF everyone awkwardness level! Exactly. public health people, J&amp;J serious benefits. It‚Äôs cheaper, easier store, needs one dose, makes easier set vaccine clinics rural indignant communities. Pfizer Moderna objectively better. shopped around got Pfizer, hadn‚Äôt available would‚Äôve gotten J&amp;J. consequence UK administered lot AZ, elderlies. Essential workers, medical staff, would primarily got Pfizer.

This relevant point, we've vaccinating people Group 6 since middle February, group includes people risk age group 16-65, also includes unpaid carers, estimated [13.6 million UK, 35% ages 43% unpaid carers ages 45-64. Combine key workers received AZ prior group, would argue UK younger people vaccinated AZ nation. wanted bring people's attention additional context, something underestimated UK's rollout.

You're right saying part answer lies rollouts differing terms strategy around age, start get data coming now, seeing relative volume fatalities countries have? could are, whether data lag otherwise, expect even fatalities number AZ vaccinations UK younger people continue. Alternatively, might not, question returns countries like Norway Germany disproportionately affected this, despite fewer vaccinations. I'm sure what's next either way, still think we're distance everything lining perfect context, even latest UK concerning indicator. adds discussion, corrects assumption EU exported kept itself.

The confusion lies fact although EU kept 88 million doses itself, actually administered 60 odd million. indeed administered less exported, wrong. adding information. Yeah true listened thing today seen anything way convincing evidence existing variants threaten (what appears be) long-lasting vaccine induced immunity. forgot /s birthday too!!! childless Oh contact tracer, amazing. must also make expert immunologist biochemist. opinion vaccines immunity mean crap tried year shit work all. like type messaging abstinence fighting AIDs, work. ESPECIALLY Western societies, shaming instead providing resources, alternatives, safer options year blue face. agree this. pandemic day get second dose. COVID police me. Yeah shit. Trump‚Äôs vaccine distributed large amounts country. look announced delivery dates vaccines, see Q2 quarter vaccinations take Europe. BioNtech (Pfizer's partner) opened one largest production lines world Marburg, Germany. Previously they've relied mostly Pfizer's capacities. Germany alone receive 80 million doses Q2 (for comparison: solely \~14 mio. Q1) push easily 50% line early summer. think much different Scandinavia. numbers would like cdc reports.

They say 39,2% adults 1 dose. use 265m adults would 38.1.

The numbers figured backwards % cdc reports Thank president TRUMP!!!!





For getting fuck WH letting real adults handle shit. don‚Äôt disagree, think fallout indirect. mean, someone believing right infect disease new level nasty. mom got 2nd dose yesterday. PhD public health, 70s, still like, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt feel go all! almost went back nurse supposedly gave looked like 12 year old!‚Äù 

So, yeah. It‚Äôs tiny needle. facetious also feel like it‚Äôs nuts something tiny could powerful. anti vax wary many brands fully tested yet? anti vax concerned serious side effects? Vaccine makers can't sued fyi. Florida southwest. We‚Äôve long attitude ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu! deadly!‚Äù frustrates hell me, circle trying help stop spread know is, thanks. 

While current vaccines guarantee neutralization since tailored towards mucosal immunity boost, still efficient humoral cellular immunization. result, ‚Äãnoticeably increase viral load threshold COVID contraction vaccinated people due cellular immunity response IgG antibodies present anyway. also dramatically reduce time frame viral load generated previously vaccinated infected person immunity kicks much faster prevents virus proliferating large volumes tissue spreading across body. pretty damn close neutralization.

I reason believe different carnivores. bring ADE neutralizing antibodies here, no, that's issue current vaccines. fact, vaccines prevent situation produce lot competent neutralizing antibodies memory them. see, person contracts virus, always incompetent antibodies produced. S-protein one, antibodies proteins might turn non-neutralizing. person lucky, enough competent antibodies combat virus matter much, not, asking severe case long COVID. person extremely unlucky contracts COVID stays ill long, incompetent antibodies may cause ADE substantially aggravate problem. person already vaccinated, enough neutralizing antibodies proven work, situation stays control. 

In words, [steps reduce risks ADE immunotherapies include induction delivery high doses potent neutralizing antibodies, rather lower concentrations non-neutralizing antibodies would likely cause again, reason believe work carnivores.

What issue COVID domestic animals. cells organisms infected virus, faster mutate. already known change hosts, already playing fire. since people (myself included) love pet carnivores, virus strain capable spreading carnivores people alike disaster. virus even attempt recombinate highly lethal viruses FIPV... Well, definitely want that. vaccinating pets mitigating risks. simply chance mutate like that. People: new wave came from?? Doesnt say constitution government isn‚Äôt allowed discriminate based race? That's like saying ""this house fire, grabbing water"" hiring!

Could definitely bit hiring boom going soon too! vaccine stay alive avoid nasty symptoms really test, CDC requiring test indefinitely guarantee virtually every single discussion whether came lab right inconclusive thanks lack transparency abundance coincidences.

We're hundred million people vaccinated now. That's massive sample. 

Correlation != causation.

My husband flying Thursday, that's we're moving he's going first. However, we've first shots we'll 10 days post first shot, we're pretty good there. feel safe (and get sick, he's quarantined across country us). 

Tomorrow night we're actually people first time since begun. We're one shot in, neighbors fully vaccinated, we're dinner one last time. According everything totally fine, still feels weird. boy going fun. Socializing table inside. Eating together. 

In June get see mom. It'l 18 months (normally go six seven months). 

The end near. 

Everyone, get sots!! WOO HOO!!

Now, c'mon juvenile trials! It‚Äôs almost like Biden admin taking credit vaccine üòÇ thanks President Trump!!! Maybe people would stop deciding personal finish line Biden announced actual one. entire presidency ""not yet, maybe sometime, over, afraid"" slew pessimistic depressing remarks.

It's complete disaster messaging. Nothing Biden people saying encouraging regards vaccination. He's essentially saying changes nothing, expect result people risk wanting get vaccinated?

The messaging ""If X% people vaccinated hospitalizations Y, masks, distancing, capacity limits, life goes back normal."" Fauci messaging ""Maybe 80% people get vaccinated open museums masks distancing long we're careful."" That's destructive. needs stop.  Oh yah. actually spoken English quite time I'm weird dialect :/. Also MN (well, third professional athletes NHL developed myocarditis can't play without risking death would say otherwise. definitely ""normal blood clots BC"" seeing run-of-the-mill deep vein thrombosis, immunological. mechanism completely different akin something seen patients given heparin. think bizarre. Deaths PLUMMETED nearly 50%. Hospitalizations went .3%. Glad Masai let us know. kids spread viruses others. Bruh.. 3 waves.. one never ending wave. Siigghhh.....maybe one day again. fully vaccinated, safe go like normal (while still wearing mask, course)? hang people vaccinated? Yikes, thank god didn‚Äôt reverse. mean influencing decision quarantine, wear masks pour resources creating vaccines logic? main reasons deaths 2,850,000 instead 10 times many. 

Regardless, original post misleading anyway latch someone's comment pretend admitted media fear mongering ""entire time"". put words people's mouths. Surface transmission rare eye transmission rare... unless someone literally roughing mask still covered phlegm touched eye, 99.9% chance fine. Yes, reach approximately steady state vaccination rate, 1/2 second doses.

Again hell get masks gone May July that? Christ they're talking vaccine passports, would need actual herd immunity achieved? Yes. Makes sense! good turn events. thinking, let‚Äôs vaccinate vulnerable. think it. vulnerable less likely take risks. So? Vaccinate willing take risks. don‚Äôt developed frontal cortex‚Äôs. gather spite danger. hope provides great results. I‚Äôm betting will. Bolsonaro government genocidal friend , follow protocol fighting covid followers him. Yeah, cause went well said small gatherings people masks congregate last then, people mask shit like that. gonna get ""well I'm vaccinated, I'm scheduled!"" hanging friend group pretending vaccinated. Victim shaming back menu. course not. Biden's office now. Yeah you‚Äôre talking surface transmission. You‚Äôre fine haircut last year? not, mean 100% would months ago regardless lol.

Hell, one important things simple oxygen masks help get oxygen peoples‚Äô blood. didn‚Äôt exist 1918, that‚Äôs even getting better standards hygiene limit spread, overall better nutrition means better immune systems, etc. covid hit 1918 would likely killed far more, without vaccine available would likely taken 2-3 years go away ever (which doubtful would). difference question momentum? I've never known different kind makes sense wave would momentum behind something really stop surge could sudden hot spot disappears fast appears.

Or could talking completely ass lol I'm curious heard distinction  Isn‚Äôt internet coronavirus transmit eyes? I‚Äôm confused. [Dr Reiner F√ºllmich. says Covid19 PCR Tests fraudulent- Lawyer sued VOLKSWAGEN &amp; DEUTSCHE BANK That's definition scare mongering lol nervous too. side effects gone within 36 hours Yeah, vaccine hesitancy could end significant problem. even then, problem inherently social, perhaps individual one. Antivaxxers leaving open dying virus; they're increasing spread everyone, lead deaths. course, *source* antivaxx belief also often social, spreading via Facebook such.

Mine's handwritten Playing devil's advocate here's happens: lift restrictions minority people vaccinating, increasing circulation virus. time, vaccine selecting mutations virus especially resistant it, leading vaccine-resistant mutations vaccines exhibit selective pressures.

With Covid 2% total population got infected far less (statistically speaking) died , I'd argue thanks preventative measures influenced fear factor. 


Imagine prevention measures 1918 Covid infected 2.3 billion people (Which one third current population). Makes sense opposite I‚Äôve hearing elsewhere. OP prob anti vaxer digging article suit broken agenda. Sure. people actually followed would done month. people ignoring extended this. Judging link looks like could walked place point week get it, whether qualify not.  Oh that‚Äôs okay! covid isn‚Äôt top news item everyday year, I‚Äôll way less useful since happens one thing know really well lmao. It‚Äôs fun party trick sans party fun making statements impact behaviors hundreds millions people - yeah, there's urge pump brakes making conclusions lest get something wrong thousands people get sick die result.

Best example said early masks really help trying preserve stock prevent hoarding, learned actually masks fairly effective. 

To public looks like folks know they're flip-flopping, reality thats process learning new information adjusting behavior accordingly measles vaccine even good

Nah, is. Two doses MMR 97% efficacious measles. health decline

Omg. live Maui. locked March Nov. couldn‚Äôt even sit EMPTY BEACH face $5,000.09 fine. got really lucky; cases. also limited supplies, everything closed, people suffered financially. 
This Spring joke joke. let 10K ppl. maybe 12-59 cases. Now, we‚Äôre getting hit entitles rich assholes ignore mask mandate. people leave quarantine who‚Äôs enforcing it? we‚Äôre seeing 79~100 new cases day. It‚Äôs island ONE TINY HOSPITAL. 
The sheer arrogance assholes moving there/vacationing astounding. Perhaps larger proportion post graduate degree holders medical doctors college degree holders nurses. Oooh that's great idea, might use that! People lockdowns restrictions last longer minds.

There tons. look Reddit. lot people get lording moral superiority people, lot people get fear hysteria, lot people antisocial lazy they've loving society-sanctioned regression. deny covid? Nice! Hope win millions. need kids masks they're sick even catch it, serious symptoms. time someone stood reasonable people. over, make time.

You're fine. Yeah, know much medical jargon mom RN 25+ years talked constantly. Helped learn lot, though. Colorado opened vaccines everyone 16+ today. Hmm interesting, know that. 

Definitely interesting balance here, according Vermont data, targeting BIPOC community actually relevant based prevalence Covid communities vs White. Since that‚Äôs case, whole communities would higher risk VT.  Half million (more 553,000) Americans dead virus, including member family.

 2.83 million dead globally.

And try compare flu, year th flu kills estimation 12,000-61,000 US citizens year. Even using high end 61k, Covid-19 killed 8 times people America.

Tell ""fear mongering."" I'm disagreeing anything said. would point younger people, mobile, likely get Pfizer hospital elderlies home.

Still, question was: ""If countries [...] reporting fatalities, come seen UK [in spite many shots]?""
So, first off, UK _is_ seeing now. That's point article. is, like said, ""a concerning indicator"". Second, good reason problem could absent UK recently, noticed first countries _in spite performed much fewer jabs_. point.

None mean problem exists all. sure hope (bad) chance. wish, since different countries adopt different strategies, would take care reviewing other's data. Maybe help out. need perfection serious reduction spread. far vaccines effective variants don‚Äôt think know you‚Äôre talking about. vaccinated means doses two-dose sequence. one dose J&amp;J.

Common educated people left right. Would possible MSF similar organization get involved? summer  everyone gotten vaccine yet, thus need continue vigilant make sure everyone wears masks.

Don‚Äôt surprised report zero vaccinations tomorrow 6 million day later week. distribution increase terms location, age, gender, race, etc? fear mongers doesn‚Äôt good track record correct. wish states would volunteer med students something go assist countries. sad hear. US. Maybe nurses lol didn‚Äôt look badges got mine, really don‚Äôt know. ignore *some* people gotten sick, still stock market take Monday wonder feel peanut butter allergies? misleading comment. You‚Äôre technically wrong, evidence points extremely low probability vaccinated person spread virus others (especially level it‚Äôs lethal person). 

At certain point take risk assessment move life. Sadly looks like fourth wave definite. Santa Clara County near perfect mask use, worried. live conservative area/neighborhood relative county, count number times 1 hand I've seen someone without mask. slight cough, may even remembered. mostly sneezing sniffles. Moderate allergy symptoms, basically. wasn‚Äôt even feeling ‚Äúsick‚Äù. Marvelous, they? worth, anecdotally, received first shot 3/11, husband exposed around amount time 3/20. two friends exposed us tested positive ~3/25 got results 3/27. husband test 3/28 tested positive. around husband literally week caretaker surgery. tested positive tested negative (with symptoms). I‚Äôm getting another test tomorrow ‚Äúin case‚Äù 2yo tested negative well want sure negative still ~5 days later safety precaution sending baby back daycare 


Once again, purely anecdotal, thank god vaccine. dk would husband (totally immobile right due surgery, (now currently main caretaker 2yo husband, 2yo came it. 


The silver lining husbands surgery timing covid timing already keeping baby away part fear injury first week so, I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs able avoid getting infected too.

Crazy times You‚Äôre thinking 100m doses Well time soon, Texas still first wave Mid may, adult population 70% vaccinated. Thats current vaccination pace. increases, sooner. expect too. Australia testers proper nurses specialist training. get paid. certainly volunteer. Thank efforts. Well said, thank sharing that. 

I wish best erasing pain nice memories. time feel terrible majority world's population hope receiving vaccine while.



Thank you, America ‚Äú. . . negotiated . . .‚Äù

This frame absurd. Well you‚Äôre vaccinated don‚Äôt worry things data shows vaccines kicking butt‚Äîincluding scary variant

Yes recent studies also shown people's antibodies also create variants time variants work variant virus still protected. basically know long term story possible virus could win long term human body aces sleeve well. may take while. 60% adults say they'll take it, make ~75% population. 

so 0.6√ó0.75= 0.45, vaccine isnt 100% effective, lest say 90%, 

0.45√ó.90= 40.5%, ~40.5% population immune vaccination, enough stop it.  prevent getting virus time, it‚Äôs rare circumstances catch vaccination, don‚Äôt end sick enough go hospital. scientists didn‚Äôt enough evidence make confident statement significantly reduces odds catching always suspected does, data starting come areas high vaccination rates confirming suspicion. feel even though watched go in. bizarre. always feel something shots. Aww shucks.he must upset ride ending. expect special treatment? decided live another country... little five, one people working told absolutely best time go since past point number people scheduled doses failed show up. understand generally getting doses intended someone missed appointment- believe also guaranteed second dose, something set aside mystery person show up. totally understand.

I typical travel planning timeline 2 weeks, semi-frequently asked fly cross country 24 hour notice.

I‚Äôm home weekends, great, fits social life needs well me. honestly like living suitcase. life partial minimalist - pack 2 pairs jeans, 1-2 pairs slacks, 1 suit (2 involved trip), 4 dress shirts, etc. get home, dump everything suit slacks washer repack. 1 load laundry every week. need constantly clean apartment. low maintenance life, previously worked ridiculous hours frequent (every 9-12 month) relocations, improvement.

I booked flight first time year (traveling late may), actually exhilarating. look forward getting back road. know many people still can‚Äôt taste. I‚Äôm currently working teacher ended getting it. tires super easy falls asleep around 7-8 every night. What's alternative? test? take measures all, numbers show pandemic, would never reached severity spanish flu. first paragraph blank shot.

I seen anything stating this. link actual study read through? stuff read mostly articles general gist would much worse 1918 flu given complete lack care available. fact covid variants evolved 1) able re-infect people already 2) contagious, deadly, capable targeting young demographics (instead contagious less deadly diseases) really reinforces point. Better standards hygiene effect? Yes degree would effected essentially guess. cant use that. Better nutrition? Yes firing blind here.

You run comparisons historical disease transmission adjust see today. perfect means, yes would essentially educated guess, bit silly leave things discussions know would absolutely confounding factors simply way perfectly measure gauge it. methods save sick increased deaths? Agreed.

Yes, think quite appreciate insane number would be. Cant fourth one third doesnt stop cheeseburgers, cigarettes, molly, coke, gambling addictions, excessive booze, working Nice nipples bro ... smokers.. argument decades ago again. ban smoking indoors public transportation? prerogative enjoy cigarette wherever want. 2009-10 H1N1 confirmed though really similar 1910 one (as far numbers assigned). complete agreement led bad waves Spanish flu also, among after-war, secondary bacterial infections, etc. Honestly mid late April seems probable, see Yeah. Which, again, part reason behind *did* happen past year. *did* different *should* done many ways. lot people paid ultimate price that. 2,581 COVID-19 patients studied, 95 percent patients regained sense smell within six months, according study Journal Internal Medicine.

Your brother may special case smell symptom thank bringing dose reality conversation Congrats! time day go? Vaccine passport negative Covid test then? I‚Äôm venues requiring negative test proof vaccination. Gives incentives people take vaccine want enjoy normalcy. ask symptoms covid go vaccination site. able get shot coughing?  think folks missing fact states also eased restrictions past month. gets balanced small uptick plateau, we‚Äôre still right track. 

It‚Äôs important recognize aren‚Äôt herd immunity yet, probably 50% country still immunity. Israel saw happen vaccination drive too: cases still increased among unvaccinated people hit critical mass make R0 drop significantly. I'm glad brought up! commented article well posted sub. messaging even experts quite contradictory. article particularly bad. headline implies vaccinated individuals *never* get covid spread it, article body makes clear never:

""Among fully vaccinated people study, three COVID-19 infections detected.

""Unvaccinated participants logged 161 covid cases, scientific evidence experts say proves fully-vaccinated people protected two ways.""

which exactly meant much less likely so, impossible herd immunity.

Does someone need **exactly** strict 2 weeks second dose vaccination? No; neither consider pandemic ""over"" them, person replying said. Fully vaccinated people *gradually* ease less strict life cases deaths fall. FL, 40+ til 4/5, everyone. one brother, older five years, got COVID, gets breath quickly can‚Äôt smell still. doesn‚Äôt sound exactly healthy.

You‚Äôre fine man Well he‚Äôs right everything else...right? Wear mask, don‚Äôt wear mask, wear mask caring covid-19 victim...wear double mask. land first dude go ahead keep butthurt im saying challenge thanks slap Pretty sure terribly racist unconstitutional got mine today. J&amp;J, preference going complain getting 100% protection hospitalization death. 2.85 million plus died. people outside US. can‚Äôt get HIV standing next someone though. THANK kern countian, please send loved ones friends get vaccinated too. Theyre literally letting people choose shot want w/ walk ins I‚Äôd upvote twice could never left 1st lol Lmao police literally going check many food people cars travelling deduce going (illegal) gatherings people can't go city another work health necessity purposes, meanwhile allowed citizens get airport vacation abroad. Basically good long got money. Testing order able domestic traveling even discussed. shitshow Hey, probably right thing do. picked sarcasm! Lol really hoping forgot /s. Schools Petri dishes disease spread like wildfire children, families teachers. words iconic Grandmaster Yoda, ‚Äújudge size, you?‚Äù still people 65+ group still looking shots month ago. see opening EVERYONE going complete shit show. I'd love wrong. That's good positivity; keep shit up, man. I‚Äôve always thought hospitals generally filled 55 85 crowd. I‚Äôm convinced yet anything changed conclude younger people ICU greater rates past. gonna lie, haven‚Äôt looked closely Disney particular. work Cedar Point though, claim hasn‚Äôt case linked. Nobody department tested positive year, either, might truth that. ‚ÄúNo Stupid Questions‚Äù ‚ÄúToo Afraid Ask‚Äù type comment it‚Äôs covid related figured would best place ask. 

If USA vaccinating fast right now, STILL seeing surges across states? Shouldn‚Äôt new cases least leveled? good weeks ago, don‚Äôt understand we‚Äôre surging again. Meanwhile people America taking J&amp;J's chimpanzee virus vaccine like big deal! 16 yo vaccinated Washington meet requirements (working restaurant example) Pfizer vaccine, two vaccines 18+. Jesus... planet living on. incredibly big brain reply. substance, context, rebuke.

Just arrogant dismissal... Pathetic. Calling people work entire state governments siding irresponsible. creates bunch drama Looks like needs get hair Sure, county really good vaccine rates vaccine adoption. I'd concerned case. think hall monitor types gonna struggle lot weeks everyone ditches masks distancing. It‚Äôs gonna leave big hole lives. thing they‚Äôve revolved identities around last year gone. Got mine today, son getting Monday wife hopefully get two weeks (myself son phase working next phase). sometime early mid-May. slightly amusing watching people complaining customer lists restaurants paying credit card. CDC message made good friend Fiegl-Ding pretty salty thought milestone reached ago Right, look UK. prioritized getting jabs arms they're extremely well it. 50% Britons jabbed they're fucking killing stats accordingly. 

Empiricism winning out. speculating something obvious (less educated people die take precautions/don't believe covid)... People less education *more* likely work entry-level service jobs (cashier, server, housekeeping) higher risk exposure due sheer volume people interact with. Compare hundreds people cashier may serve one day, refuse wear masks/distance, one two people someone working home may exposed to. Also, lower educated people typically higher birthrates, meaning moving parts factor childcare, hybrid school, etc. account multi-generational households hit hard. 

But yes, also tend science deniers refused wear masks. I‚Äôm MO. That‚Äôs mine looks like, plus sticker w/the vaccine date batch #, etc. wrote name b‚Äôday it. feel like daily covid cases useful statistic example tomorrow started testing twice many people would get large uptick cases things actually get worse. new rapid tests coming market used see cases continue rise less people actually disease. Deaths hospitalizations continue downtrend. feel like people got wrapped self righteousness Covid cautious cannot think living another way without good boy points something. shit read that!!!  lot Americans zero empathy anyone Yup people still masking near Fort Worth/Tarrant county. get idiot happy far people taking serious. I'm normal person sense humour. That's why. think hold mirror maybe ask person see question instead me. 

Trolling fun. way I'm harmless. Nobody gets physically hurt. fun I'm bored redditors IQ 100 get riled butthurt something read internet. Let's hope nail fake cardholders proverbial wall. Bhutan little 770,00 neighbours friends India, biggest vaccine producer world makes easy thing do. 
Nonetheless, great thing hear. vaccines arms always good thing. Yet another country reaching herd immunity. hear don‚Äôt think smoking type comparison hell, look shady AZ reporting phase 3 results US FDA. left whole chunk/time-period data dropped efficacy rate like 5%. quite admirable U.S. one main health/pharma regulating agencies World that's held magnifying lens Astrazeneca/OXford's data instead throwing another Emergency Use Authorization. Yeah, I'm looking books rn. Can't really find actual good content online really much confidence accuracy. think probably actual medical textbooks. Let know recommendations. is. probably feel bit tomorrow it. *6 waves later...*""ok expect 8th wave""  Lower 100% capacity make financial sense, doubt many concerts happen reduced capacity. mask wearing touched eye. worried?  yup got double exposed weeks ago taking care mom brother glad got return work without testing quarantining. hard send J&amp;J doses embassies hundreds US military installations abroad expats show vaccinations. We're talking opening vaccination centres foreign countries. getting idea government made blank ‚Äúavailable publicly‚Äù? need clear photograph one Photoshop, republican buddies fuck around hurt people, EZPZ Nah. relative. 

Fear justified without vaccines, distancing masking defenses. current vaccine rollout studies showing robustness, less fear legitimate defense.

Saying ""entire time"" silly. Times change. There's time worry there's time optimistic. understand. We've never left first wave. We've never fully contained covid 19 response.

in US. Keep civil. Use report button, instead. That‚Äôs sad.

Even 100% normal close. second dose Wednesday sick earlier Yeah it'll come back time. Tell get J&amp;J it‚Äôs well-established technology. Like maybe validate concern somewhat. reasoning, following comments, flawed term ‚Äúvariant‚Äù isn‚Äôt incredibly meaningful own.

Viruses don‚Äôt mutate way new viruses, save you‚Äôre talking astronomical timescale billions years... viral evolution weird, anyway.

So SARS-CoV-2 ‚Äúvariant‚Äù another virus sense. It‚Äôs even immediate descendant first SARS virus. variants we‚Äôre talking extremely closely related, genetically vary amino acids.

You‚Äôre right passaging humans allows virus adapt better, way means it‚Äôs going evade vaccine neutralization. you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs 9% chance getting diarrhea?? would government make blank publicly available incredibly easy print didn‚Äôt know would happen? Reading message made tear up. hope right I'm fucking done this. I'm need still I'm ready worry anymore. got first dose Pfizer recently nearly cried starting process. actually think we're going catch UK end deliveries expected decline whereas going massively decrease. Herpes come! Israel Palestinians negotiated limited autonomy palestinian mostly govern owne affairs.

Israel taken health care would actually diminish autonomy. calm Israel heavy handed? Weird. New England North East, Yes. Nebraska, no.

Sorry. way infectious disease, arguably does. causes variety health costs, well strain hospitals, society large needs bear.

Using logic...so cancer. STDs. alcoholism. Literally everything puts strain healthcare talk hundreds millions individuals.

If want get weeds things talking obesity healthcare system, also talk parts America certain income brackets hard become overweight based diet available you.

But would irrelevant. literally google print it. They‚Äôre available directly damn government. It‚Äôs big forgery conspiracy. could literally one minutes. Perhaps never seemed left first wave? like this? Uhh... seriously waiting CDC ‚Äúpermission‚Äù this? Alabama intesifies. guess genuinely get would lol. vaccine free adult state get less two weeks. take test beforehand one yet. make sense fake vaccine? doubt get called it, legit crime that? Agree. one knows long immunity lasts. time tell. missing something??? Wouldn‚Äôt vaccinating people spreading virus lead drop cases? Got it, ah, makes sense. Might digits millions tho (i.e. ex: 258123456 instead 258000000), easy way get digits (The hundred thousands could influence % tho). highly reccomend checking Outbreak.Info scripps institute uses GISAID variant data. look state see many sequences done well variants mutations found.

for examle Texas 34,418 sequences listed 28.70 million maine 1,997 sequences population 
1.34 million would think bigger state big outbreaks, bigger resources &amp; larger universities would done sequences preoperationally tiny Maine, instead roughly even math right

I'm glad Modern already trials s. African variant specific booster &amp; novavax said working one. Better 'em even turns need 'em, need &amp; it. Seriously would pretty evident entering Korea Vietnam test two three times person. doubt he‚Äôs even considered something obvious though. Cured! Really true. Shaming lead permanent decline smoking US. US lost fight coronavirus majority people didn‚Äôt ever follow masking social distancing. tone appropriately set top, would easy surround, shame, convert refused follow rules. totally works. one Spain walks around without mask. Hopefully feeling social responsibility, rest fear shamed publicly. Think nose mouth genitals treat home nude beach. Oh. read that. certainly good news. 

Do know variant is? understand Pfizer Moderna vaccines good UK African strains. mean can't get sick, end ICU. Indiana open 16+ (Pfizer only, two 18+ per FDA authorization). even resident anymore either. $10 Ducks games though... I'm  downside mild inconvenience waiting?  Point one us. Meanwhile western countries tens, even hundreds thousands, needlessly died, mention restrictions lockdowns still happening. inhumane. kind case. 

Fauci shouldn‚Äôt personal opinion much anything. read talking points regarding science direct people towards politicians comes political issues like covid restrictions. 

Him coming saying opposite head cdc flip flopping. fact contradicts messaging government officials flip flopping. 

His voice government‚Äôs voice. Saying things different government flip flopping. think applies people know sick still stuff. know sick, really think right way put it. Maybe, maybe not. It‚Äôs holiday weekend. So, let person outright lie repeatedly, factual statements taken might slightly mean? Yeah. seems equitable. Why? I‚Äôve covid I‚Äôve vaccine. I‚Äôm getting giving anyone. time normalcy back. Agreed! It‚Äôs also like comparing apples oranges studies J&amp;J vaccines different. It‚Äôs hard media explain intricate data science behind vaccines. J&amp;J going key stopping pandemic.

I‚Äôm glad able get first shot last week! Exactly. Daily death numbers still steady decline. Lagging indicator, know, I'll keep watching them. vaccines working keep heading even new case numbers while. Glad you‚Äôre better! article North Koreas response covid, nothing article apartheid South Africa‚Äôs response covid, nothing else.


Would feel same? like idea. also really want visit Vancouver summer. think UK waiting longer shots people get first shot bring overall covid rate. makes vaccine effective, that's bonus love family everyone family roommates gotten vaccinated life good keep hearing 6-8 months come up. think NY's 'vaccine passport' whatever they're calling lasts 180 days.

I'm hoping time goes they'll better idea long lasts last checked CDC said nothing definitive. makes think might recommended high-risk elderly get booster. Hospitals glad return normal exploded hands 4th July. Vietnam we‚Äôve 3,000 cases it‚Äôs big surprise they‚Äôve 100k. literally test cities millions batch testing rare cases pop up. Start emo band Shame state, people running state people supporting politicians. much we‚Äôd like move past restrictions, reality can‚Äôt shouldn‚Äôt yet. Shame decision makers enablers jumping gun. Claim victory lift restrictions everyone able get vaccinated, before. decades long war killing people needlessly? fck third?  Okay stupid question. got first Moderna shot 3 weeks ago. done 3 weeks. 85 percent protected. 

Should get haircut wait? boyfriend bit discussion vaccine. got first Pfizer shot, waiting second. He‚Äôs set appointment behest, feels like much soon get vaccine without knowing side-effects long-term.

We‚Äôve talked extensively firm stance safe. don‚Äôt know else tell him. Pfizer said it‚Äôs 1 week.

CDC says 2 weeks. believe they‚Äôre people don‚Äôt get confused page, since Moderna definitely 2 weeks.

Feel free you‚Äôre comfortable with, got Pfizer personally going wait 1 week. can‚Äôt assume effective variants COVID

Fair enough. people understand incredibly GOOD vaccines are. numbers around effectiveness incredible. laypeople refusing J&amp;J vaccine ""it effective others."" stance ridiculous. best one hit 60% effectiveness we'd considered resounding victory.

In short, vaccines effective variants. they're even half effective, good enough. Why? makes sense. Right doesn‚Äôt make sense older people aren‚Äôt really ones spreading it. long. &lt;3 cali  whole year loads loads infected world increased likelihood particular autoimmune coagulopathy seen before? Yet seen Covid patients before. think adenovirus. Scare mongering term thing you‚Äôre describing. 

It‚Äôs old school mindset worked largely due lack information. problem much information. scare mongering become counterintuitive. Goro. vaccine hesitancy/ antivaxxing skew number though? much pops choose vaccinated? worry. unlikely something happen. father law cancer sensitive one ingredients he's fine. husband also got vaccine today we're ok. scared first even hurt, arms little sore that's all. That‚Äôs cool. 100m ppl gotten shot. father retired cancer researcher get FDA approval medicines created. FDA really thorough. concur w another poster may want reconsider bf. Unless virus mutates fight vaccines. hard know ultimate threshold be. Keep mind vaccination effect last forever probably last couple years let's say two four think that's necessarily true. know guy got vaccinated ahead schedule ~20 year old immunocompromised.  said, I‚Äôd rather 95% disease 1/2 - 1/3 contagious. 

Agreed. Measles really ridiculously virulent. Bit think. Official CDC recommendations state limit interactions vaccinated one unvaccinated household time... multiple unvaccinated people together. CDC always going cautious recommendations. Increase younger people haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet won‚Äôt get sick.

The vaccines break virus like Israel.

Don‚Äôt listen fear mongering voices trying hang last vestiges covid panic.

We back normal couple months. buying pack smokes Lol. I'm hard time believing that. know kind mutation is? what? aren‚Äôt going get virus two vaccinated people, aren‚Äôt going spread virus two vaccinated people. Lol 'be sniveling, little playground monitor snitch'. Nope measles get herd immunity dumb. I'm going person comments without reading article. Shaming work. social pressure, like videos people ignore anti-masker adult tantrum target. blaming shaming someone effective we've seen year. husband parents got vaccine today. arms little sore we're fine. wish sooner poor grandma passed covid-19. think needs symbolic first.

A $1 tax credit, get shots October 1st, 2021. Republicans getting shot, know would anything give ""the government"" another dollar.

Then tax unvaccinated people 2022. US lucky. get shot two next Thursday. feels really good, time feel bad folks US. 

It‚Äôs funny, train-wreck pandemic, it‚Äôs balls-to-the wall shots. Minnesota native‚Äîcall southern Canada‚ÄîI hope guys get plenty vaccines soon. great country hope visit soon. Cuz can't die measles dude like get immune forever, one depends variant someone hard core belief vaccine good idea simultaneously belief allowed events ""eh I'm sick"" dont want wait test....yea they'd probably fake vaccine card instead. 

Counterfeiting conceptually crime, reality one going go individual small time counterfeiters, like fake vaccine cards. They'd go entities faking cards instead. data normally delayed least several days.

So it‚Äôs wrong say know current numbers today.  realized: Independence Day going insane year, it? gonna twice many attempted relationships embarrass since sexuality/who I'm attracted really loosened quarantine/lockdown. ""picky"" anymore lmao  also great case-study AZ vaccine. Well US apparently Covid supposed eradicated time last year People shaming others since Stay Home timeline.

Oh, yes, individual people shaming others. one person, anti-masker write ""uptight"" keep going lethally wrong behavior. multiple people speak (not later comments internet video), actually seem work. Peer pressure powerful, case used good.

That's added ""as society"" ""reliably"". needed consistent beginning. Every time someone entered store without mask, stared at, talked to, yelled multiple people. Anti-masking would mostly faded away, lot people would died.

Of course, many regions seems *majority* view skeptical masks. That's much bigger problem one reasons consistently shame behavior society. Every card I‚Äôve seen including handwritten. friends literally came Rite aid printer paper. printed store. It‚Äôs whole career. pandemic beat marijuana psychosis, misinterpreting science blatantly lying weirdo audience whole thing.  It‚Äôs included plus.. it‚Äôs higher far that‚Äôs documented number 570k? Try 30+ million people know CDC suggested 75% vaccination rates gain herd immunity also read rate may need adjusted poor masking rate, bubbles unvaxxed people due rollout/opting out, relaxing guidelines local governments. western PA, find something Ohio. 16+ statewide. else? true people can‚Äôt get vaccinated. uncle Guillain Barre (and dad died it). uncle can‚Äôt get vaccinations anymore. True. It‚Äôs great vaccine.

That said, I‚Äôd rather 95% disease 1/2 - 1/3 contagious. know much vaccines, bu5 everytine go watch news video youtube vaccines Ontario, see negative comments mostly. still want get shot, side effects present vaccines? getting 50-70% adults?

WHO says idea: site says 60-70% total population low probably need 70-90% total population. Sweden plan everyone gotten first dose august. :( think faster public educated correct use preliminary/correlational data better. Every intervention undesirable effects correct understanding probabilities exactly desired situations. There‚Äôs already much pretend system, adding going help. longer boyfriend candidate imo. think lot people lifelong changes couple years. Think people live great depression hoarded tinfoil Sandwich bags rest life everyone subreddit likes COVID vax passports said like it, could jut CHOOSE take business place using voluntary! wrong?! ... never said May, June July. said years. Hopefully end year, realistically, sooner. Smoking declined clear communication epidemiological evidence, restrictions placed tobacco companies, lots gradual anti-smoking policies, changing social norms, anti-smoking campaigns, staying ahead marketing...shame change smoking behavior. ain't it. non colored people live communities? think vaccinated able everything indoors want. guess everyone different baseline comfort level.

I'll happy discuss COVID19 past tense‚Äîminus take annual updated vaccines (doctor friends told could actually thing continued mutations). Even risk getting sick looks like drops ~80% around 10-14 days shot 1. Meanwhile EU already number four every vaccine shipments delayed unfortunate barely got 1k deaths.

You‚Äôll okay need look seven day moving average. guy says plummeted it‚Äôs bit silly track individual days there‚Äôs usually trend cafe amounts certain days. Imagine reverse much press coverage would get BS. waitlist vaccine long moment, I've given time being. think turn corner giant BioNTech plant marburg really gets going. really help ease supply constraints Europe, super-effective Pfizer vaccine too, helps even more. would point younger people, mobile, likely get Pfizer hospital elderlies home.

Of course, typically would expect rolled based vaccine stored. purely anecdotal since start last month everyone personally know receiving AZ vaccine sites dedicated vaccination centers halls well pharmacies local GPs. wish credible information hand personal experience certainly would suggest sizable portion younger population least one dose AZ.

At least, means probably greater volume data come next weeks. Fingers crossed encouraging (less fatal) data, say, see co-operation countries effectively address health concerns balance rollout. I'm disagreeing anything said.

Certainly not, I'm sorry response came way suggested did. brother wife unvaccinated. free riders. seems vaccinated people posting reddit. non-vaccinated people posted vaccine status here, servers would crash.  Things always appear be. can't drunk week drink Wednesday. want convince free rider take vaccine. Come on.

You *know* narrative past month - *young people danger need take seriously* - even though didn‚Äôt explicitly say it.

These headlines aren‚Äôt innocently *forgetting* leave rare deaths among young people reporting % increase severity. It‚Äôs purpose. 

A headline ‚ÄúKilling Faster Younger‚Äù supposed mean ‚Äúkilling faster younger still many compared risks like driving‚Äù. *know* hoping people don‚Äôt digging true risk assessment.

The messed part? Public Health officials echoing message trying keep young people home, instead giving people honest inferences. 

Defending saying ‚Äúwell, technically rates fastER youngER‚Äù equivalent Trump guy‚Äôs would say - ‚Äúwell, technically kids aren‚Äôt cages‚Äù. Yeah, they‚Äôre *technically* right, still wrong. RIP peace Well, parents drove help, originally planned store everything garage could figure logistics get home, wanted able mourn without worry move son's stuff. said would take wanted rest could keep toss whatnot. 

So garage filled stuff. 

So legacy live parts home always remembered way.

I would say OK, working it, wife kids great support system see therapist already awesome helping coping mechanisms. 

I suffered lot loss life, parents, sister passed May Covid well, fellow Marines, friends, Paul like brothers, met like known since birth. 

I think ever ""be it"", pain fade replaced fond memories, sure song come come across something his, moment melancholy, know end fine. Thanks!!! That's really kind. Seeing brother wife behave like landing Mars. least wait *thousands* Americans dying every week. know we're tired covid restrictions, fact remains human lives about. ages 25 55 Got link? seems unlikely unless making pessimistic assumptions. million (more 553,000) Americans dead virus, including member million dead try compare flu, year th flu kills estimation 12,000-61,000 US citizens year. Even using high end 61k, Covid-19 killed 8 times people America.

The spanish flu killed 50 million people earths population around 1.8 billion.

COVID 19 killed 2,850,000, population 7.8 billion...

For COVID bad spanish flu todays population would killed hundreds times spanish flu death count.

Which, even without measures took, never gonna happen seen clearly using survival death ratio... hovered around 98% entire pandemic.

It's amazing simple nobody like take critical look this. doctors, politicians, citizens, redditors tweeters alike even manage that.

Humanity LOT growing fuck do. continue responsible wear mask sake others. Lol i‚Äôm internet browser bruh go find son's pediatrician said likely end summer. Gb'eye ? Novavax also looks good, though starting ramp up. Dr Fauci financed gain function research Institute Wuhan. Yesss!! It‚Äôs protecting victim shaming perpetrators. safe whatever want data normally delayed least several days. Tomorrow's numbers reports coming primarily Thursday, also spread past 2 weeks. typically see dips Monday Tuesday. invested air purifier next bed exact reason. play pretend? Nah, I‚Äôve responsible. someone hasn‚Äôt vaccinated doesn‚Äôt wear mask, nothing me. know it‚Äôs people, that‚Äôs got vaccine. According recent polling, 62% Americans either gotten vaccine already get soon possible, 17% say wait see. half break toward getting vaccine that‚Äôs 70%. way trend going though think could get 75% without anything different. sounds lit timeline living from? People shaming others since Stay Home timeline. Despite putting shame internet sites sending viral, ""shaming people save lives"" work many expected objecting right thing then.

But gives morals what's asshole however. support reversed don‚Äôt get situation control quickly starry reopening aggressively. Nah south. live Lake drove 6 hours round trip first shot. Meanwhile Ontario.... never resolved quickly throughout history. 

We've never level medicine biotech history either. experienced Ciovid year know catch 

Yeah wearing masks social distancing, thought sick of? Guess know now?: several completely safe vaccine options **work**. vaccine don‚Äôt know long run it‚Äôs political it‚Äôs human nature cautious! 

Do people read anything scientific prefer freedom.blog.patriot.eagle type sites? vaccines rushed, untested products, safe know safe. cautious getting it, literally anti-vaxxer. mods enabling running interference last president since April 2020. teachers get choice whether come teach home? guess no, point kind irrelevant. teachers yet fully vaccinated forced come in, masks need mandatory. Information scare monger, scare mongering comes sources, feel scared mongered(?), might want look closely sources information instead attacking information itself. felt pretty ""meh"" 36 hrs second shot. people feel shitty sick, people feel fine. Good hear many people getting shot starting think productive things worry dying plague. 

Cheers getting back normal!  Well want get it. Supreme Court ruled 2003, Grutter v. Bollinger race could factored admission, cannot basis admission granted.

Here looking race defining characteristic. would explicitly struck down. vaccine deployed today won‚Äôt protect variants claim help designed. 4,000 known variants date getting started govt wanted vaccine passport framework would existed. 

It exist, called clear health pass. 20% normal. delay what's received what's administered administering what's avialable takes time. 80-85% around get demand supply even. 

If look data available 80% higher average. States across board serious trouble finding enough people vaccinate ratio dropped low mid 60% deep south.

I believe they're studies finding primer AZ booster pfizer quite effective though.  Exactly.

Anyone know updates info international travel yet? fully vaccinated since January would love visit fianc√©e. goal 100 million shots makes bit confusing seem like great achievement. pretty sure people would actually want ADA go away, become disabled themselves. would first line demanding protections.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Orlando VA also great, opened vaccinations veterans age groups actually start vaccinating spouses 7 days ago.  Unfortunately seems general attitude Texas. FIRST......so sad. sure seeing surges states. We‚Äôre already fourth wave!

Aren‚Äôt we?

I‚Äôm confused. think correct certain states/regions. exciting! listening he‚Äôs always wrong??? reason allow certain age groups go first. I'm mistaken discriminating age illegal too. unfair racist done hurt specific group help them.  Maybe ask state government. Picking choosing paragraphs complicated laws isn‚Äôt something interest discussing. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wear mask! makes touch face, spreads!‚Äù incredibly big brain reply. 

I think understand it. Yes bad thing. explicitly racist government policy banned civil rights act 1964. many times fauci wrong? amazing simple nobody like take critical look this.

You taking critical look it. pointing bad Spanish Flu, 500,000 dead Americans okay then. US students - Let get spring break bruuuuuuuuhhhh!!!!!! vaccine won‚Äôt protect variants claims above. okay point opinons dont really matter change mind week. went bed feeling fine woke feeling fine. Thank info side effects far I‚Äôm feeling exactly shot. Mine Massachusetts, I'm sure this- all- believe schedule vaccinations much later five either state CVS. seemed essentially wrapping around six, mentioned spares around time left. waiting observation, asking us call friends family might want vaccine, asking everyone store. One customer asked actually mentioned got vaccine couple days ago actually found pretty funny.

If can't sure best time getting one pharmacies near would be, would bet go ask employees they'd happy tell likely time walk get vaccinated would be. Unless get real jerk who's obsessed priority groups, they'll almost certainly happy give much advise think help. That‚Äôs, same, wtf explicitly basing whether person get vaccine, that‚Äôs federal government violation? racist make bad thing? 'unfair' doubt without good reason. like elder gets vaccine first. Unfair there's reasoning behind this. Nah got destroyed. pull freezer, clock starts ticking. administer dose within hours go trash. Unfortunately.

I heard piece advice trouble finding appointments: look county county election map 2020. Use zip codes heaviest Trump counties search. They‚Äôre ones appointments available.

That nothing guys north, dual citizenship, give shot? Good luck, hopefully run people willing vaccinated, get extra contracts delivered guys around world they‚Äôre really need. Great.... thought Canada bought vaccine population? Hey got emergency hand brake measure place... Closing ffs. Producing would overstatement deliver less 20% goal No. isn‚Äôt.  really really hope true I‚Äôm sick misleading headlines.  getting ID assessable literally every person eligible ID, system ineffective, complete failure. Dr. Walensky said vaccinated people carry virus, would discussion,‚Äù John Moore, virologist Weill Cornell Medicine New York, told outlet.


Shitty headline. didn‚Äôt reverse statement, clarified it. Oh god Oof, never check actual reality, break heart. Full shit. thought so.  posted old article, also wrote completely incorrect title. article says don‚Äôt know. said not.

What absolute train wreck post. worries bases data extrapolating current status. saying make lot people less careful. worry positivity could create cases making light current situation. seems like cautious individual educated time information often conflicting often tailored get people act certain way (for example saying masks ineffective prevent people overbuying masks etc). me, makes hard trust. think rate vaccination exciting hopeful things get closer normal soon, getting excited prematurely could prolong this. Another month wearing masks avoiding gatherings could save lot lives. few. knows. know cautious little longer fully vaccinated can't hurt. still rising cases deaths steady daily pretty much every state. 

Who knows though expert Fauci is, two cents. Yea dude idea you‚Äôre talking about. Less 10-20% people know it. Maybe even less...  dunno.... pretty fucking stupid... wouldn‚Äôt worry much case posted sub days ago. news. research you? lol   love defined mouth mouth engagements anyway.

Don't tell people love defined, dude. cases still high rates would Australia done less month. dicking around limited vaccinations received. scawy vawiant, uwu use almost pathogen would use traditional vaccine for, some. Heck, could easily pack multiple strains single shot. Well would fucking hope Marketplace tested KN95 KF94 masks sold online big box stores. Half didn‚Äôt offer level protection they‚Äôre supposed to, according lab test results.

More info testing website: conversation yourself? shower debate team scenarios? I'm scheduled get second Pfizer dose Easter Sunday. Looking forward it. get vaccine potentially tomorrow excess 2 hours away. potential drawback symptoms driving 2 hours getting shot? Yeah, seems pretty common younger folks especially. 2nd shot moderna felt like flu 12 hours so. Totally worth put behind me. pages helped keep dose wastage low! oh boy.nur probably wrong safe, would point vaccine? yea person talking about? 'everyone' getting they're staying inside following guidelines? gathering anyway. got covid ended fine although first vaccine taken. get two im whatever fuck want Fauci eat explained population distribution among different groups different. hispanic people likely lower education groups white people relative total population subset. actually able get partner appointment within two days joining local Facebook Vaccine Hunters page...He‚Äôd really hard time finding one super exciting! Well know long term effects are, obese diabetes something? Would make sense case. year ago  See? Trump right! would Easter! wait RNA vaccines kick ass cancer. I've heard whispers preliminary data cancer earth shatteringly good! Yeah one really said that. known numbers least day behind months now. can't fourth wave third wave end. remind side effects immune system job. Covid flu though that's fucking point. absolutely right probably tough catch it, initially. long term effects? Novel disease means we've got fucking clue might road every study thus far shows nothing good. Quit treating like goddamn flu, even remotely same. Fauci Friends raking millions sales vaccines, everything fine him.

Providing medical solutions people early stage Outpatient COVID-19 would honoured Hyprocratic Oath. http://flccc.net ""yeah keeping locking every time there's single case"" people? Far right? said right wing. statistics REALLY considered... people dont bother look statistics critically compare previous events similar nature...  simply using statistics show you... 

You shown statistics. literally done nothing ""subtly"" hint intelligence sense doctors researchers. walking example Dunning-Kreuger; caught idea intelligence even realize far depth are. 

Again I'll ask, actual sources back statements? total amount people critical condition COVID?

I'm aware place stats combined totaled properly different countries since reporting methods data vary heavily. I'm sure exists idea much would cost access get since sites listing reported cases deaths. know US data states responsible reporting stuff, need aggregate historical data 2020 get clear picture. There's incomplete total found: issue view however missing fact early oxygen often prevents lot people even reaching critical care part things. Covid absolutely crushed hospitals inside large outbreaks well, ton patients basically given oxygen sent home. 

All say even take case \# multiply 5, we'd still barely 33% population infected, covid would likely slow stop well 50%. 

One last thing well. highly likely current covid numbers severely underrepoted based excess deaths many hardest hit areas. Much data asking really available years researchers actually compile dig data Covid finally over. vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean virus can‚Äôt infect you, means body primed prepared knowledge fight quickly serious symptoms, maybe you‚Äôll never even feel thing. far 3 vaccines 100% effective preventing hospitalization death, aren‚Äôt 100% effective preventing infection entirely.

So still chance infected pass virus fight off. 

I think lack understanding common something needs advertised more, it‚Äôs people mistakenly think it‚Äôs stupid wear masks vaccinated. need ton people vaccinated ditching masks. gay pirates didn‚Äôt get scurvy double edge sword, gotten vaccine (this fast) covid. wonder use common flu suppose true. yeah that's happening Canada, lot's variant lot vaccine yet. Hopefully, month 2 good. city last week 30 cases per day, 300 per day single week. got grocery today month worth. longer... this... old news, can‚Äôt post anything online. honest one believes me. don‚Äôt reason lie leave I'm younger states already got it. future clubs concerts involves masks, attending. let's real, venues make money selling alcohol. Masks simply *can't* thing.

Also, can't hold concert without masks, safe enough hold masks. Masks helpful, ancillary. Hmm, something seems odd here. Could someone better understanding explain this?

I believe across nation hispanic death rate greater white death rate (CDC source: Rate per 100,000 person-year Table 1 hispanic rates ALWAYS less white rates education cohort. I'm Seattle weird sort hobby younger people engaging in, call find times stop see leftover doses, some.places waitlists. There's whole FB page dedicated vaccine hunting worked me! FB, check see there's Chicago Vaccine group, may full tips tricks! might scientist know someone works Vaccines said takes 20 years develop vaccine. worries me. 

Oh god. Make sure stay rock protect rest us then. 

Thanks,
Those common sense.  Damnit feel things returning normal I‚Äôm going miss excuse leave couch üò≠ Glad agree something! really mad wrong sheesh data? kind cancer? way?

B117 variant taken Ontario 60% likely hospitalize kill, 100% likely cause people end ICU. going impact younger people previous waves due vaccination. part said Netherlands refused correct. agree slow processing ineptitude Netherlands handled poorly.  JJ vaccinations slow? delivered like 20 million vaccines? Offices still open. transportation.

What kind lockdown this? None 3 kids get vaccine. So, no- everyone get it. deserve make safely vaccine too, they‚Äôve given year childhood.

Don‚Äôt tell ‚Äúkids get mild illness‚Äù either. surge childhood infection variant causes serious illness, kids getting seriously ill. We‚Äôre already seeing this. do, enough. 3 months vaccination campaign managed give first shot half people older 80! imagine? case Tampa, FL hurricane totally wreck town Tampa done yet necessary prepare catastrophic event even though powers know due one day one since we've insanely lucky now. actually keeps night sometimes. read day 1 shot Pfizer vaccine 80% effective 100% effective preventing death. cdc never going give all-clear, view. wouldn‚Äôt wait start living Eh I‚Äôm liberal don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd it. think less deaths would occurred though. Yeah sorry, dont, do. honest, know people florida got vaccine eligible CVS. checking anything. I'm encouraging lie anything, also get stabby turn, turn. think fine. Sounds like worried morals though, logistics. me, fatigue kind felt like drunk. terrible feeling, honestly. Got good sleep it! 15 hours post 2nd Pfizer dose.

Slight headache general soreness, like hard work out. Otherwise fine. TN anyone 16+ get vaccine. state opened yet booked capacity? kinds? I‚Äôm getting moderna got first vaccination shot yesterday. 

Injection site sore today yesterday. Pretty much every intra-muscular vaccination I've ever had.

 never felt fatigue. fact spent 12 hours shot painting room. said, sat couch dinner woke spot morning. wife says tried waking go bed butt dead asleep.

 feel great today besides shoulder feeling like someone punched it. 2,988,825M/day currently. hit tomorrow.

They definitely said knew value today. Osterholm you!? UK making joke..  Ah yes - mild rna vaccine mutates entire human rabid zombie? Stop spreading nonsense Also side effect lot people considered younger age groups work lot jobs reopening loosening restrictions. chance exporting few? totally understand. ease back things slowly, wait CDC gives all-clear. Right you‚Äôre supposed still wear mask public, you‚Äôre supposed still avoid large gatherings. CDC says may gather unvaccinated people one household, only. folks Florida sub saying able schedule CVS next week, eligible (under 40), even though accurately fill form ‚ÄúI‚Äôm priority group‚Äù won‚Äôt let book anything tells you‚Äôre eligible, even then.

Anybody experience FL? let thru gave shot ? would ‚Äújumping line?‚Äù dates available tons appointments right USA: Seen find first shot records anywhere they'll get reasonably suspicious kick curb. think going = wasting life? dumb question again, hard wash hands wear damn piece cloth thing dissipates? Congratulations appointment! J&amp;J tech AstraZeneca. totally roll conclusion... I‚Äòm you. Unfortunately huge part Austrian population Sinovac 83% efficacy turkey, 100% efficacy moderate severe disease. Yes. president 2020, America would pandemic already, would many nations, assistance. What. ofc get hurt covid lol US Citizen, applaud efforts voted guy Noro put daughter hospital once. hold liquids got dangerously dehydrated. horrible. hope people stop washing hands. I've seen people skip even pandemic retail job. takes extra minutes.  republicans skipping shot

It mostly them, though. guess idol tells it‚Äôs hoax year, aren‚Äôt hurry get shot. think going individual would uphill battle. get corporations board make employers mandate it. want jerb gotta get shot. Sure, become less effective, still effective no-lockdown. see problem.. hard wash hands wear damn piece cloth?  Dr. Fauci said around 70-90% too. trying optimistic. comment made happy. thing is, dining out. fact group people, casually celebrating birthday, Michelin-starred restaurant meal costs several hundred dollars--a restaurant, turns out, got $2 million PPP loans last year.

That bad optics, like spitting face millions people struggling suffering throughout California prior 7 months. can‚Äôt go back normal without herd immunity. We‚Äôd least pandemic stuff like masks pretty much forever unless hit herd immunity. got mine yesterday well! Arm soreness started 12 hours symptoms. Curious see respond second one. forget young folks get hurt covid.

They absolutely thought mentioning prior infections beneficial reaching herd immunity, happened Texas states, limits here? wife got second dose yesterday. 12 hours later, knocked asses; headache, fever, chills, aches pains. weird thing felt alright 4 hours later. wasn‚Äôt pleasant I‚Äôve worse hangovers, definitely don‚Äôt make plans night/morning get second dose. seems pretty aggressive immune response quite common (at least amongst friends also got it). Regardless, 100% worth it. one said couldn't

Literally headline said Amazing! Thanks sharing watched legend.. please send excess Australia, roll-out dismal far... Best news I've seen long, long time. Yeah last wave europe matches exactly UK variant going single percent cases 80%+, would expect happen US well AZ still amazing vaccine, nothing balk makes sense me, also depend breakdown actually is?

If 25 31 cases Germany 20s, would something draw conclusions from? Mass I‚Äôm still expecting June/July timeframe. state incredibly high demand. Australian ego issue relying almost totally AZ vaccine produce locally rather securing adequate supply vaccines like Pfizer Moderna. eggs AZ basket. that's looking like mistake. people got vaccinated developed GBS \~ 2-3 Weeks vaccination (up months) years?

And still likely develope GBS flu infection compared vaccionation?

Source: Here‚Äôs hoping. they'll need another 6 months. Thank clarifying! Payment terrorists bounties successful massacre Jews, Jews killed, bigger reward. can't even imagine moral bankruptcy one achieve defend literal bounties killing civilians.

When Palestinian appreciate help Israel provides, places better situation neighbors?

No one labels Palestinians terrorists. make BS, support anything, even state bounties massacre civilians. Compared covid deaths comparisson, is. CDC saying ""Vaccinated people could potentially spread Covid spread could potentially become huge cause re-infection"".

We've known ages re-infection extremely rare, pushing either means a) something changed, b) someone higher CDC Director telling caution reinfections [reason]. care?

Because internal passport system gets recommended every time there's national emergency. people proposing virus. virus. link 2001 proposed last major time fight terrorism. 5 points still apply today. system solve problem claims solving. that, get antibody test terrible idea get J&amp;J vaccine day job interview? keep politics please? 

Your remark add knowledge level. normal viruses become contagious less deadly time

That necessarily, even usually, true. think real number Covid deaths worldwide 3 million 4 million, even though number reported deaths 2.8 million. I‚Äôm sure pandemic mostly over, final estimate real death toll. Yeah, I‚Äôm time life. People finally washing hands generally little cleaner. expected go places don‚Äôt want go. People don‚Äôt come house. get online want. It‚Äôs best year life. mean, know Brazil's hospital system collapsing hardly anyone vaccinated, getting absolutely slaughtered there. that's reason enough believe particular variant nothing take lightly. know waiting data know study often derided, I'll look sure, say ""better safe sorry"" rather ""this probably end"". two cents. way u/zombthebomb pushing ocugen‚Äôs vaccine stock company. That‚Äôs they‚Äôre skeptical ask, I've also seen data similar variants (SA) escaped natural immunity:  


""This study examined whether CD8+ T-cell responses COVID-19 convalescent individuals (n=30) potentially maintain recognition major SARS-CoV-2 variants (n=45 mutations assessed). one mutation found B.1.351-Spike overlapped previously identified epitope (1/52), suggesting virtually anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses recognize newly described variants."" Brought obvious desk. I‚Äôm one asking question. need provide source? It‚Äôs something heard. source disproves this? I'm introvert I'm unhappy. introverted mean dislike social interaction. love social interaction. introverted means social interaction makes tired drains energy, certainly me. talks indoors change yet, police said direction force outdoors without changing anything ""on paper"". That's, uh, true  Let‚Äôs gooooooo! 3M daily average April 100M month alone! Pfizer Moderna reported side effects first dose. vaccinations, probably expect next one. stop reporting spread talk hospitalizations deaths spread isnt issue. Big relatable ""vibes"" one. year working home one meeting week blessing I‚Äôm driving 65 miles get first dose afternoon! seem come pretty hard Chipotle analogy.

See 2023 stop asking proof vaccination come cave cause pouting proof vaccination whole time! :) Wow! Thank info/discussion bashing. I‚Äôm saying haven‚Äôt seen enough documented evidence support claim hate seeing people false hope pandemic almost over. I‚Äôd love get back normal lifestyle see friends family. someone UK, feel like Boris Johnson says random things positive negative hair always looks like came thru wind tunnel lol comparable all. Anyone wants ID get one. Yes. cat‚Äôs bank WFH clearly viable. hiding behind ‚Äúwe‚Äôre scared one productive!‚Äù. company forces employees start commuting worried workers simply leaving. seasonality. northern states getting hit hard March/April like last year, southern states better like last march April got worse summer. know. It‚Äôs put ‚Äúonly 8 million‚Äù perspective. EU indeed distribute according populace 8 million still lot. Hmmm. I'm somewhere introvert extrovert besides bored slightly often nothing really changed me. clearly things miss, really affect mood. bottom line neutral. hope genuinely good faith, try polite patient possible.

First, clear two misconceptions way. ""Vaccine passport"" catchy nickname press coined. resemble passport way, merely ID saying are. post soviet countries, Id documents still called passports, even. 

Second, extremely countries need proof vaccination travel. african sub saharan states precarious level state enforcement little healthcare infrastructure available. Almost international travel happens without them.

The main point ""getting vaccinated anyway"". idea vaccines truly accessible everybody, ""goals"" written sand politicians trying save face constantly moved backwards. countries world, Russia Serbia, vaccine supply outstrip demand, effectively punishing people age, whatever factor makes priority group. mention poor countries able fulfill vaccine goals years. simply lock them?

It annoyance. Think common immigration, international students, etc nowadays. might separate families years come. 

Second, fact someone else already raised: case madness indeed enforced even small aspects life, unprecedent, would mean severe burden businesses employees would bear responsibilities police force. Imagine you, shit low paid McDonalds job, forgetting check vaccine passport app serving costumer anyway, meaning huge fine employee, losing job even potentially getting criminal record? Absurd, it? plans vaccine passport Denmark going moment.

Third, completely pointless. consume lot time, effort, money moment public authorities strained, measure would make sense epidemologically literally moments. Look vaccination, far complete, done already UK, US Israel. long keep burden people virus long ceased risk? Apr 3 data delivered now. care? would put mind slightly ease? point FREE market agree choice choice there. care choice make, make choice me, that's whole reason want government mandating it, takes choice away you. Someone donated million dollars development. Statistically good sample size across many parts country. May ask interested vaccine India hasn‚Äôt proven yet mRNA virus among highest efficiency efficacy vaccine ever made 7 day avg past week 3.1 million!

There **massive** ramp past week. reversed would riots. much equality Hi everyone. (31, F, major health conditions) got first dose Pfizer vaccine yesterday. know side effects (sore arm, chills, fever etc) relatively normal, particularly 2nd dose....but looking online im seeing much side effects 1st dose people....did anyone get 1st dose? 

I chills/fever night today headache, pretty significant body aches over, especially legs...Anyone else experienced first dose covid vaccine?! choice? 

You're still welcome show card. Krispy Kreme they'll even give free donut. Florida restrictions giveaways vaccine passport. comparison last Saturday January 1200 reported deaths. drop remarkable. anyone mood changes getting vaccine?

I got Pfizer first shot Thursday thought going pretty well dispute headache last night. feel strange today, feel sudden urges cry reason anxiety. No, didn‚Äôt. month ago: things still arent safe, lot people vaccinated, still continue mask months things safe. think worth point go out

Yall: ok shut get never wanna go shut fuck go back man cave

Me, now: know vaccines work, almost third country vaccinated, september everything open, dont know college still gonna nearly online think thats bullshit

Yall: shut fuck care yourself. People still dying. one cares you.

Do y'all see one likes reddit bunch boners. basically got EU's self-pitying response, nasty US UK blame sharing share.

The UK native vaccine production covid. part Brexit leading fears EU could withhold vaccines, part obvious danger relying purchasing vaccines produced countries might suddenly decide want keep vaccines (Australia could tell that), UK government paid factories set UK would domestic production, *as well* purchasing vaccines produced private companies countries EU. Many countries (again, notably Australia), doubtless wish done thing too.

Paying set factories UK cheap, given AstraZeneca produce vaccines UK paid for, since partnership UK government. 

The vaccines produced EU exported paid EU. factories produced paid EU. existing factories owned European arms Pfizer manufacturers. fulfilling orders countries normal free market conditions.

Had vaccine manufacturing UK prior covid, would exporting vaccines UK now. example, Pfizer UK factory prior covid, paid UK government, would free export whichever country purchased vaccines them.

Instead paying set domestic production Europe domestic market, EU went shopping vaccines free market. join queue along every country vaccines produced factories happen located EU. EU's choice way, EU chose wrong. Crying *they're* exporting vaccines countries ridiculous. 

The US little dirty effectively imposing ban vaccine exports, early made clear everyone, Australia like order vaccines USA. EU done same, countries like Australia would sought domestic production instead buying EU manufacturing, UK would cut contracts buy vaccines produced Europe doubled domestic production instead.

The EU's crocodile tears getting really tedious. vaccines manufactured Europe exported EU's withhold, bought paid countries. vaccines produced UK US bought paid US UK governments, whether paying entire production line (UK) advanced notice countries bother (US). think starts happen ""100%"" least one shot 2-3 weeks.  Exactly. big bar scenes, going lunches, kind real ""in person"" socializing form entertainment. introverted chronic pain, prefer socializing online control environment better end socializing want/need without made feel shitty it.

I also play MMO lot, lol. asking whole vaccination record though want know got covid shot not.
And gonna permanent thing, it'll last like 6 months TOPS. show go pub time sure, I'll show proof got covid shot. skin nose. Amazing! That's 4.08 million shots reported today. 7 day average 3 million. true. also recognised respected offices. you‚Äôre introvert allowed work home. you‚Äôre extrovert like talk colleagues office allowed that. I'd pick vaccinated one.

Why? Look, businesses whatever want long Desantis wants. complicated. There's way avoid COVID transmission normal household situation. airborne known preexisting immunity (unlike seasonal influenza).

On positive side - prompted get first vaccine yesterday. procrastinating like crazy. Sometimes really silver lining. least CDC acting normal. Boris sucks thing appreciate COVID measures people generally respectful personal space. expect violent swing back near future. I'm looking forward hugs strangers. it‚Äôs worth, reasoning first statement incorrect. Mutations spike protein would mutations impact vaccine efficacy. extremely limited sequence within spike protein actually targeted host immune response, overwhelming majority mutations within entire protein reason impact efficacy. 

So, yes, new spike mutations arise one say without experiments would detrimental impact. But, safe say something high like 99% not. Yeah Redditors, ever, fail distinguish introvert literal hermit lmao think that:

1. made argument all
2. argument ""fell apart"" stupid ID analogy

Well, then, already convinced right even replying me. There's help you. 

Enjoy lagging vaccination rates. See 2023 finally emerge cave. scared wearing masks, guess could always stay home ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø... normal viruses become contagious less deadly time--they spread better inhibit kill host much. need fearmongering dramatics.

then end seeing people say one thing complaining reaction got, seeing people said exact opposite complaining same. Thank time patience me. apologize tho study 4,000 people high risk doesn‚Äôt cut me. anything mentioned variants. Real world? conducted 6 states? Think agree virus definitely affects every state, city, country ect differently. research prevalence variants country. You‚Äôll notice variants becoming prevalent USA end February. Again, hope insurities surround vaccine variants wrong. I‚Äôm holding old school technology ‚Äúinactivated whole-cell‚Äù vaccine bharat bioscience India making. Hopefully available Americans June. compute prevalence highly stringent areas like California low stringent areas like North Dakota Florida.

I mean, that's easy dodge, going better that. R^2 stringency verses cases/deaths near zero. scatterplot sneeze, showing completely random assortment measures little change. Well, point vaccine card knowing OTHERS vaccinated. Obviously. want visit business requires proof customers vaccinated, choice? someone else want show proof vaccination, choice well - go business requires it.

I lasted 2 months picked side job restaurant weekends serve bartend. extra money nice able talk people prevent loneliness apartment dog main reason. work 7 days week don‚Äôt regret it. see vaccinated others. I'm concerned, I'm fully vaccinated, let's real choice two flights one required people vaccinated one didn't, I'd pick vaccinated one. government deciding private businesses can't make choice available. Maybe pick non-vaccinated flight, mandating everyone make choice? point capitalism market decides choices available. government overreach stupid-it's mandating everyone make choice make. here. mom got second dose yesterday brother 2 weeks 1st dose dad 1 week out. think we'll hit point everyone wants vaccinated done transition way supply demand? year change, extroverts finally felt pain rest us normal times. small shred justice unjust world. took comfort knowing others bad time. made feel alone knowing ""untouchable"" people never bothered shit suddenly losing minds. made human me.

My depression far better year ago. Interesting. Pzfiers roughly 2.5 months ago never ""head rush"". Deaths lag behind cases, we've basically hit plateau cases US since late February (which since turned slight rise). issue COVID deaths caught case numbers think would've seen rise deaths now.

So think possible right, think better explanation vaccinating seniors at-risk Americans first we're going see decline deaths despite rise cases.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I‚Äôm dreading coming pandemic feel terrible people awful experiences. I‚Äôm introvert enjoyed every second lockdown, actually became competent chef got work home comfort home distractions. Yes I‚Äôm introvert. parties right now. There's pandemic going on. mass murderer super spreader going parties. Shame you. many covid deaths think world since excess deaths often counted covid deaths virus replicates certain tissues. Mostly upper lower respiratory tracts.

So lung noise. 

The virus can't get lungs without infecting upper tract first.
Plus see infection lungs via x ray. 

People may think lots cells ace2 receptors virus infect cell types. 
But virus also needs internal cell machinery replicate. may bind cells replicate them. 

There may replication gut amd heart sever cases.

The thing PCR detects virus indirectly detecting viral rna. 
It taking small amount RNA, amplifying replication get enough detect. 
You infer much rna started many replication cycles takes detectable amount nd amount rna copies detected. 

So infer initial sample form ongoing infection picking debris amd remnants. 
 vs one presenting symptoms run minimal amount cycles see high rna copies then. say probably seeing active infection. semi introvert here

Covid lowest part life, first fine months went slow in-person interactions friends, apocalyptic feeling everyone spread interacting, inability travel see friends family, watching friends marriages fall apart slowly killing me.

I developed severe anxiety depression getting day im actively something like working feels impossible, want sleep time away can't even sleep properly anymore.

Things enjoyed past gaming watching movie immediately put deep depressed state, depression anxiety developed given ED issues can't even really go dates anymore.

I nothing left life except work governor refused institute statewide lockdowns COVID protocols like mask mandates. Local leaders urban areas like Miami Orlando went ahead anyway.

To honest, places like Steinhatchee Ochopee probably need lockdown. doubt much movement even bringing virus communities begin with.

But governor right saying Florida close taking credit middle-of-the-road performance largely thanks decisions taken county local governments line states doing. one gives fuck Canada Full disclaimer anti-vaccination, people already vaccine hesitant going see messaging wonder point getting vaccinated is. thought process be, ""if still get transmit virus post vaccination nothing changes, get vaccine."" 

If want convince vaccine hesitant crowd, done via good messaging emphasizes efficacy vaccine pull us nightmare. Telling people nothing change post-vaccination extremely counter productive.

However, vaccine passports going authoritarian...wouldn't next place try also require it? place that? places block? introverted, cannot confirm.

This country going freaking berzerk 45 days!

Also note children much lower risk infection - half adults. That's like vaccinated right there.

Given friend wizmax soon, plan 155M shot end month. means least 80% effective mid may those, avg effectiveness even higher. 1/3 remaining adults already infected, 33M. 85M children got 50% protection 10M even since they've infected.

Add up-
-155M 80%
-33M 60% (conservatively previously infected)
-85M 50%
-that's 273M (or 80% Americans) +50% protection may 14
-total protection percent population would 55% (70% best guess herd immunity full effect) 
-by shots slowing I'd expect total protection percent increase 1% every 3 days, full herd effect July 4th right. we'll major reduction - guess mid may

Yay! Maybe extroverted, damn Makes sense.

[Yeah read right here. Section 2 clearly Businesses Florida prohibited requiring patrons customers provide documentation certifying COVID-19 vaccination post-transmission recovery gain access to, entry upon, service business.

This cannot possibly clearer. study analyse direct impact COVID-19 infection pregnancy, designed look collateral impact coronavirus pandemic antenatal, birth postnatal outcomes received second dose Thursday (Phizer). anticipating flu-like symptoms following day told many people got fairly lucky guess.

Previous Fall, literally walked CVS asked flu shot problem Yep bby. That's beauty free market People could least decency admit appears truth‚Äîyoung women‚Äôs lives traded notion ‚Äúthe greater good.‚Äù 

The thing misleading ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù statistics hurt UK‚Äôs credibility damage AstraZeneca‚Äôs reputation. first extreme headache night hangover following 3 days. Fine that. Totally worth protection. Highly recommend everyone get so. number per capita cases country.

Sounds like good testing infrastructure. Good them. sort deaths per capita that's number counts. learned outdoor spread respiratory droplets common? yeah right understand anyone would want vax passports. fighting this. enormous opportunity abuse opened. vax available anyone get would need anyway unvaccinated people following rules going start suddenly sort messaging. anything, entrench beliefs motivate even violate restrictions. reinforces notion governments want go forever. Yep. disagreement able get flu shot without appointment Walgreens family member RiteAid. Good job, hope nightmare ends soon! last part great callout, infrastructure ready place go. Subsidize government money time uses. think we‚Äôre happy pay that, also ends saving money overall economic damage pandemics believe much better alternative would simply mandatory vaccination. believe legally difficult unpopular. 

Why instead then? Well, believe mandatory means responsibility government provide vaccine everyone enforcing. effectively making mandatory, transferring burden people. How's reopening going? mean I'm actually extrovert? Let's recap then:

You want system that:

1. uses name vaccination status somehow
2. forgeable also enforceable local state laws still
3. Successfully keeps vaccinated away unvaccinated people
4. Despite clear real reason except ""I want choice""

A system like antagonize people.

Why get impression going DMV religious experience you? fibromyalgia flared next day. Fine that. Lol key component society really. Read order says ‚Äústate agencies‚Äù can‚Äôt ask documentation. 

Has nothing private businesses. haven‚Äôt worked year, barely go out. haven‚Äôt relaxed long time. got first round vaccinations though, I‚Äôm point probably looking work, I‚Äôm kinda bummed long vacation going soon. don‚Äôt know data you‚Äôre looking at, isn‚Äôt true. North South Dakota first second highest number per capital cases country. California slightly beating National average, impressive consider population density.

Source: 1 shot still gives ~80% protection. It‚Äôs like get first shot, receive 0 benefit, miraculously two weeks second shot jump protected ‚Äòfully‚Äô protected. One shot alone wonders putting pandemic behind us. Mandatory vaccine law depends State reason mandate. Generally speaking, employers mandate vaccines. Even could mandate vaccines, mandate FDA approved vaccines. current time, zero FDA approved Covid-19 vaccines. Better 5G signal. One issues cost short term period. go pint it‚Äôs easy. establishment though, need enforce that. likely needing extra staff, increased risk confrontation, security it. prohibitive businesses. look chaos wearing mask created, adding enforcement top issue.

From perspective UK, vaccine passports mentioned able go pub. Pubs don‚Äôt people door, they‚Äôre going need hire security open, deal potential issues. bar staff have, normally 25, extremely unlikely vaccinated ensure customers are, leading tensions. lot customer base non-vaccinated group, finances opening add up. lot said it‚Äôs financially viable open everyone come in.
I‚Äôm sure crossovers US businesses.


Its generally fairness, everything open everyone time, especially half population go fun. financial burden could inflict enforcing it, along national level investment passport solution. get data part it, everyone okay information sharing required, either government business level. want conservative side saying, wait get data, definitively prove that.

This seems reasonable stance see seriously say something like would temporary. still dealing nonsense, security theater airports terrorist attack 20 years ago. Fuck 'em want participate key component society. places still require appointments flu vaccines I‚Äôve rewatching whole series! sounds like homer line. Got second dose Pfizer yesterday. Wow. It‚Äôs amazing much sucked. Full fever shake within 16 hours. wanna know it‚Äôs like get virus vaccine. Acetaminophen really helped. Seemed break fever. wiped migraine. Would absolutely again. Covid killed people know left others lasting issues. Feel lucky. people nothing change post-vaccination extremely counter productive.

It's catch 22 situation. says vaccinated people meet indoors, unvaccinated people meet together exploit rule. roadmap clearly shows vaccination lead changes post vaccination. rate it'll take less four months fully vaccinate every single American adult. Obviously can't vaccinate every adult, insane fast going. get average rate 4,000,000, it'll take less three months. think we'll get 4,000,000 day, think large death numbers effectively eliminated early summer, especially CDC saying people vaccinated extremely unlikely get infected all. amazing stuff. end era. Ah words ‚Äúhuge cause reinfection‚Äù never uttered. He‚Äôs talking first infection, here, reinfection. He‚Äôs referring whole ‚Äúcan vaccinated people spread it‚Äù issue. think difference anyone terrorist time, whereas virus already downward spiral.

That said, agree alot security theatre. 0 0. shot Monday MA, I‚Äôm kinda nervous reading this. DM site happened? damn 4m That's think. Cool. still want choice. I've gathered government demanding businesses act certain way I'm it. guess free market go it. Fair, many global cases TB currently? Lol someone tell stop complaining. took one team. Carry simp üëãüèæ way happy lockdown. spent time family, motivated home improvement projects chance work lot personal problems. back work full time hate everybody again.

Any idea might get vaccinated one? less covid circulating fall Getting first 2 hours!! peak r/cringetopia material. want sound much like Boomer

No worries, type Gen Z slang. word around while, use generally confined East Southeast seems like unlicensed Karaoke venue sort.

You got karaoke part right, licensed - Covid, they're allowed open doors yet.  Netherlands.

Actually something observed part 2020 mask mandate. mostly people wanted feel safe rather safe, pushing got wish end. saw shops, usually busy, sudden got overwhelmed entire populations wearing masks felt safe.

Needless say happened, cases shot like rocket right mask mandate. time infections leading antibodies create spike protein antibodies.

I remember study reported last year. Everyone need vaccinated it‚Äôs true Getting first shot hour. phobia things medical totally going worth it. else felt sad emotional day shots? Bizarre. Cried hard days shots. IMPENDING DOOM depends herd immunity I‚Äôve read comes 70% (could wrong) vaccinated antibodies natural means. However, sentence something really poorly crafted like ""vaccinated people can't spread it.""

Isn't kinda true though? Genuinely asking. Please also act like year's experience novel disease, new, virulent variants emerging, hospitalizing greater numbers people younger cohorts, long enough correctly make determination. Make sense, extrovert got super depressed winter first time ever. Reading

All best people. really hope one day get back normality  Doubt it. demand in-person entertainment way big industries die. Hell, even *I* want get pandemic over, used total shut-in! year cabin fever, I'm excited stretch legs.

I'm hoping experience similar brothers, I'm prepared worst. Theoretically speaking, would happen get infected virus, say, week getting initial shot vaccine?

Would degree protection point least negate severity, would hadn‚Äôt vaccinated all?

When discover 70+ percent American adults either overweight obese, you‚Äòll learn statistic isn‚Äôt relevant one might hope. Pfizer Moderna first created vaccine try 1 dose trial failed jump straight 2 dose trial?

Any ideas started 2 dose approach?

Anyone isn‚Äôt asshole California South Africa variants different mutations, variants somewhat resistant antibodies target ""garden variety"" COVID.

The drop antibody effectiveness cases pretty dramatic, good news would appear even reduced efficacy strong enough prevent symptomatic infections. 

Clearly, 1:1 relationship antibody effectiveness number symptomatic infections (which expected). likely relatively narrow band antibody effectiveness separates ""mostly immune"" ""mostly vulnerable"".

It already established way coronaviruses replicate allows emergence ""hybrids"", hybrid strains COVID19 already detected. California/South Africa hybrid significant potential much better evading immune response either parent strain. However, major advantage South Africa strain since pre-existing immunity still somewhat rare.

As people get vaccinated recover sick, situation changes. immunity exists population, advantage hybrid has.

So likelihood, discover variant bypass existing immunity *after* major chunk population vaccinated.

**TL;DR** Even correct ""sweet spot"", spot change situation changes. change title put guys name it? Kinda weird. He's wearing kn95, he's endangering anyone. comply, escorted out. sure big story asymptomatic people much worse masks walk disney problem. test positive fever later something? new variants linked anecdotes much shorter periods critical illness They‚Äôre lot used to. **Can vaccinated people spread virus?**

Any answer get either ""yes"" ""no"" wrong, (though may changing soon!). ""maybe, probably not, looks like don't, can't"", going way long time. best [""it's really really studies monkeys look [*really show strong immunity, [sterilizing multiple vaccine types. We're still figuring much sterilizing immunity expected current vaccines, though starting look really good.

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance. Doctors, scientists, regulators careful language subject, would argue they're careful. said, say ""vaccinated people cannot spread virus"", find situations vaccinated people spread virus, [that would end worse hedge least me, way they're framing seems pretty reasonable, put shoes.

We may want use newly found testing sequencing capacity test sequence higher proportion flu samples. might give us head start flu genetics circulating, help eliminate flu two. We're single digits flu cases places, awesome! likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

They need replace EU based production, parts meant EU. Switzerland, Canada, UK, Australia options. 

Remember, Pfizer mRNA manufacturing capabilities, production facilities retool personnel retrained.

Sorry rant lol Go look graph, wrong. fluctuating right now. yesterday drop cases. Yes trending up. Aha! Well spotted! Economies scale already built in, idea mRNA vaccine works like 3D printer. come effective model person illness. Many different avenues. 30 cases 18 million people UK.

Normal rates CVST 5 1 million per year. 18 million dose expect 90 CVST year, 23 time we've administering AZ (just 3 months).

Don't know there's discrepancy German figures UK's, CVST figures pretty consistent expect normally. I‚Äôm also MA, adults able get vaccine April 19th. Anecdotally, yes it'd reasonable jumping conclusion. 20s female 25 31 cases woman I'd bit concerned, 31 cases really tiny percentage given AZ vaccine.

That say AZ vaccine concern, need data. Thankfully 31 cases, statistically would much clear incidence rate higher. stands blame anyone hesitant getting AZ shot, especially another option, need data know sure.

New cases start become meaningless. never liked going happy feel like lot people posturing. They're talking big soon family starts put pressure they'll cave get vaccine.

Keep mind need 60% population immune. "" covid gone "" - mean forever? experts say virus never go away.

Besides variants already US anyway, article shows. stop there? double bandwidth get us 10g. multiple shots throughout year saw article days back Reddit. definitely 12 entities creating promoting medical misinformation Facebook media platforms. commend authors trying quantify bad actors nature Internet makes speculative task best. got first dose day hit car. Coincidence? think not. Damn vaccine companies understand last sentence, looks context me. 

Anyways, there's always raw data access.

As far understand, people claim masks work viruses small, provide explanation virus gets freed saliva, say fomite infection mask usage counters effects. fomite infection big thing, even simple masks wonders, one forget protecting vulnerable without universal source control, i.e. mask wearing.

Pretty strange. Got mine day. J&amp;J trial got placebo. real thing knocked out. never felt worse life. can‚Äôt imagine actually covid. Yes exactly that. Dose limited. bet big stuff like AstraZeneca France Sanofi hasn‚Äôt produced vaccine yet. also negotiated hardball get best deal. don‚Äôt doses least don‚Äôt overpay. God forbid we‚Äôd lose much money. Wonder many days lockdown would balance extra cost vaccines lol. One? Two? It‚Äôs slight uptick look numbers context; numbers absolutely *plummeting*, began rise.

If cases plateaued rose slightly, wouldn‚Äôt concerned; fact case numbers decreasing incredible rate started going up, concerns me. scary seeing right across Ohio's northern border B117 variant running wild infected school kids. Also P.1 Brazil COVID-19 variant made appearance here.

Take precautions get vac! husband I, friends getting first vaccination Tuesday! exciting. Ha! ha! Back March last year, predicted 2.5M Americans would dead August matter did. August count 70,000.

In early December past year, predicted ""surge upon surge upon surge"" cases. case rate dropped 77% 90 days. response: ""Wear 2 masks."" Look increase Michigan hospitalizations 30-50 range. We're known months b117 deadly UK letting world know, here, people want pretend somehow not. People hear Brazil numbers, want make political. might be, p1. P1 kills young people. variants problem. sounds expensive, wonder cost would stack current cancer treatment (which course also expensive) make vaccine mandatory passports? can‚Äôt encourage many possible get see effective long run? may fine places lot Covid, Australia virtually covid one died 2021. much bigger issue get people take vaccine news clotting risk. Well, specific post talking Australia.

Number deaths COVID people 50 Australia 5. men, way.

Even small rates seeing Germany, UK, etc., take many AZ shots outnumber that. Even less focus women, exactly zero 50 died Australia. seen thread, kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated 16. know low risk severe illness still don‚Äôt want get sick. even though vaccinated pretty much things kids safer environment.  go second dose 15th. First dose similar flu shot. Little tired achey that‚Äôs it. Hopefully second dose same. husband little side effects first dose. totally agree you. vaccinated ones susceptible moving smartly get rest vaccinated. Getting little sick young fit cost getting pandemic behind us. feel like less rear view mirror too. Honestly, vaccines fully open everyone, fuck refuse them. get sick care.

After reasonable amount time everyone access, open everything. doses. Basically that. Exactly....dumpster fire. One shot maybe another one four months. needs follow medical guidelines? Canada! Despite decline number tests, number daily new cases likewise continued dropping, albeit slower rate. 
 
This one confuses me. Wouldn‚Äôt expect cases drop test less? hiv/aids epidemic effect antiviral medications. great hear. hope non-vaccinated students take advantage new plan. Day first shot shoulder little range motion. years ago got tetanus booster, flu shot, blood work done day. One shot Pfizer made arm feel much worse. Meanwhile Ohio w rising numbers, kids school decided lift mask mandate recess ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Like really think kids maintain 6 ft distance recess? tagging heavily breathing over. Ugh Interesting. would think odds much higher, 50% least. all, in-home transmission still one main routes transmission virus, especially considering scenarios involving social gatherings example 10 people gather hours, week later 8 10 it, entire family gets infected one person essential worker brings home family. Older tech one shot means less risk adverse long term effects. Education critical. Nostradamus. Quasimodo hunchback Nortre Dame. Great hear uni students seeking vaccinations new plan. Sucks surprising tuition. 100% protection hospitalization death due Covid. Don‚Äôt go feeling immortal happen news sources AstraZeneca hesitancy austria? I've heard friends pretty hesitant seen studies. Thanks got Moderna I‚Äôm fucking GAY! got first dose article published... wonder number 100,000,000? Where's prize? Yeah, extroverts apparently reported missing co-workers company sent around Webex meeting link people could drop breaks wanted to. like ‚Äúwhy world would want spend break webex?‚Äù get second dose! Plan remain cautious. ton anxiety illnesses general massive weight shoulders! lot vaccines two doses...hepatitis, meningitis, HPV, even flu vaccine recommended two doses first time recipients children. think adult first time recipients actually get two doses flu shot, probably keep things simple they‚Äôll hopefully get another one future year. 

But two doses effective one common makes sense study protocol high chance success. Remember worried vaccines wouldn‚Äôt even 50% effective two doses? big concern months.

At rate supply ramped one dose protocol would us weeks ahead process, updating guidance getting high compliance second dose would tough US second dose much later. countries nationalized healthcare would make much easier ‚Äî one source medical records, centralized outreach campaigns follow second doses, etc. talking common cold? literally proven link...

Anyone talking like clearly wrong. get wrong, link may proven future moment proven link get way good anti-Lightfoot pile on, terrible headline terrible. Vaccines short supply refusing open vaccines everyone due LACK VACCINES.

This happening Chicago: (1) Limited supply vaccine means city can‚Äôt expand eligibility. (2) rise cases means city lift restrictions 

This stupid headline conflating two things never meant conflated. Considering bad things vaccination drive fact numbers low great news. Im taking AZ.
out 1,8 million vacccinated, 437 died.
Many others permanently blind.
yes small chance.
But tterribly worse thdn taking chance getting covid again.

I sick covid 1,5 days.
Tired 2 weeks.

Ive worse illness flue.

For risk AZ vsccine much higher risk covid.
Im taking AZ.
AZ worst strongest side effects compared covid vaccines. Pfizer vaccine least side effects. kinky Uks 3 month interval strategy seems be

Stockholm Syndrome, media continuously peddling bad news views clicks. That's completely false, ramp Moderna manufacturing virtually zero tens millions proves assertion false singlehandedly. 

Furthermore need build everything ground up, vaccine manufacturing facilities unique EU, know. Canada instance manufactures millions flue vaccines year set produce COVID vaccines Canada long lost vaccine production 

You're shitting bullshit. [for Australia got AZ production going 

Yes, AZ issues, need discuss issues mighty EU AZ Switzerland's Moderna production show little capability 

It shows proportion investment manufacturing capability. Moderna really invest much manufacturing EU funds. US gov bankrolled hand held creation manufacturing infrastructure.

Switzerland vaccine manufacturing hub EU. EU lied intentions Swiss giants could gladly taken ""burden"" see capability much there. Thank asking something ""off limits"" (Where getting that? comments deleted?), instead making statement, defensive. May 12th me! I'm fucking mad still many classes mine gonna online thr fall. actually might think taking semester can't get person class. change anything, I'm gonna pissed considering many people getting vaccinated  never happened I'm export bans, UK paid it, get it.

Germany EU paid Marburg facility, everything secure first production lines (even though it). Odd probably least partially vaccinated well. mention outdoor thing. ample space. Yeah, pleasantness quarantining significantly offset added stresses navigating life outside to. That's fair point US getting situation control b.117 contagious others, seems be, push variants. UK shown already. SA (b.135) introduced soon b.117 never able become dominant. SOMETIME SOON, might arrive airport stadium restaurant, **be asked to** open app flash card, ~~be admitted place experience denied pandemic.~~ walk I'm participating shit.

I edited quote indicate I'll treating this.

This disgusting. need prove vaccinated status go grocery shopping. People absurdly willing accept inconvenience willing throw away civil liberties they're scared. I'm honestly little relieved America monopoly insane science-deniers. like learning one failed test. There's three groups:

- Vaccinated people test positive. small chance people could covid nostrils throat sick spread it. pretty sure true.
- Vaccinated people asymptomatic positive. concern people would high enough viral load spread it. think population tiny fraction vaccinated people smaller viral load, meaning less likely transmit.
- vaccinated people positive symptomatic. group may transmit less unvaccinated person likely still pass on.

So, small cohort may symptoms may able transmit COVID. data suggest rare enough vaccinated individuals without symptoms need quarantine unless get symptoms meet unvaccinated others unmasked one one. Same: Moderna here. I‚Äôm pro vaccine highly prefer Pfizer Moderna option. AZ would lowest list well. Low key best year life tbh Wow, glad you‚Äôre okay! fever high, need go hospital? Highest I‚Äôve ever 103 hallucinating point! Korea instance operates one many industries

I'm talking ""many industries"", I'm specifically talking pharma industry, thing all. 

And Korea able so, they'd prioritized domestic production first place. think enjoy depending EU one EU nice? No, massively easier, cheaper quicker production mRNA exist, set up.

Yes, again, *happened* set Europe. Next pandemic might set Tanzania Bolivia. dependent individual individuals tend tougher time Moderna. someone prone anaphylaxis someone prone issues shots probably going problems either them. Yes, tell ""tons"" character based two reddit posts, clearly I'm one assuming random stuff, you. Says antimasker cashier. another aspect everything left states given limited support.

i live democratic led state *wanted* follow CDC advice shut around couple months, point governror started saying things like ""I see meet targets national government support we've given."" opened everything restrictions paper like mask mandate mostly enforced.

meanwhile neighboring states even less people travelling freely back from. could chosen restrict movement states basis health emergency, restricting freedom movement (something that's constitutional right) pretty big deal would caused people work neighboring state would required extensive security checkpoints (something would expensive unpopular) enforce.

since restrict movement, took one person coming neighboring state less restrictions cause outbreak. fundamentally states could deal get benefits restrictive policies equivalently sized country. leads kind race bottom really justify putting restrictive disruptive policies place state going limited impact? practice means least restrictive states get dictate policy extent. walked bar I‚Äôd never day, grab beer go sit outdoor space. like country western bar big dance floor stage. Making small talk bartender said something like ‚Äúoh man, can‚Äôt wait come things go back normal see show!‚Äù looks goes ‚Äúthe first band starts 2 hours‚Äù isolating mainstream no. US's vaccine program essentially socialized - government negotiated vaccine deliveries &amp; price, countries. Distribution may handled differently, issue countries number doses available, distribution. Brexit may modified delivery UK vaccines Europe slightly, unlikely drastic effect - UK-produced vaccines would still going UK citizens first, imagine. experience made miserable? would say main differences ""introvert"" ""shut-in?""

Sounds like maybe closer ambivert. mean, yeah face value seems pretty obvious, studying something like focuses smaller details help us gain really solid understanding true. research works. generally idea results going be, research gives us good explanation why. Moderna production partly EU. swiss industry integrated EU context. Agree, Pfizer Moderna essentially equivocal better vaccine available date. said, vaccine better vaccine Take walking, jogging hiking.  Getting house getting away even hour two helps lot. Yeah....the sky blue Awesome. Thanks much advice.   People die clots time, even rare ones. matters much higher higher population control. 

Also covid causes clots... bigger problem Atlantic long takes get point. Sometimes it‚Äôs couple thousand words later.  Misery loves company. got downvoted oblivion sub letting people know quarantine didn¬¥t really affect me. Extroverts jelly! know people moderna almost issues outside sore arm, shots. And, know people knocked butt Pfizer. Seems dependent individual. know common sense best reflects truth? Science perfect process means, additional source helpful. make effective policy research verifies common sense. shows thought true actually functions truth world.

I'm surprised said introverts better, tbh. thought everyone hard time across board. Lmao! (Canada) can't even get 36 million done yet!! LMAO!!!..(crying inside). kind guidelines after, beyond ‚Äúget vaccinated ASAP‚Äù US physician (general surgeon). hospital system work opened long-term covid clinic deal phenomenon. seems, least live work, taken seriously. hope get care need. Ambivert big difference requiring vaccination international travel vs. going baseball game movie theater.

It infringement freedoms. question whether infringement worth societal benefit.

IMO vaccine 100% effective preventing deaths &amp; 95% effective preventing illness, societal benefit minuscule compared infringement. Within months, vaccinated enough people case numbers plummet levels immune-deficient people &amp; 16s aren‚Äôt serious risk disease. Even started process now, passport infrastructure wouldn‚Äôt ready time make difference short term - time would even useful first place.

I also think anti-vaxxers fucking morons, doesn‚Äôt mean want allow government take extra step personal life. MAY affected holiday weekend, course, great sign. fact even possibly could accurate numbers incredible means far even today's artificially low.

This goddamn hard lockdown, think we'd close point yet vaccines alone. We've sacrificed lot get here, here's hoping it'll get us quickly safely. want people show papers attend concerts travel, don‚Äôt want people show papers proving country legally. Checks calendar - confirm YES! government boring. completely agree lol. Yes, FDA approved vaccines tested extensively proven safe effective years data. opposite effect went many hours alone time (kids school, working part time retail) almost none. quiet alone time knew fill suddenly invaded. much love family, actually looking forward whatever form normal get introvert time back! advantage. Instead constantly check dozens sites, need follow one account Twitter turn notifications. Great. another burden underpaid essential workers. work library, never signed bouncer basically feel like nowadays work. I‚Äôm vaccine pining getting last couple months, want another rule enforce. Ambivert term. Well sounds horrible. better? long need careful reimpose restrictions dor new variants? happened coronavirus Myanmar? already beginning get control throughout January, early February, outbreak suddenly over. do? I‚Äôm boat. honestly okay like January 2021. winter limiting outdoor activities places shut limited capacity, reallyyyy started feeling starved social interaction. Finally hit limit haha Seems like fairly close. Pfizer might better Cell response. Moderna might slightly better antibody response due 3x dose. First none things. fact, I'm still none things. change opinion due facts, changed cause got vaccinated risk assessment changed. Financially definitely agree. spend much hobbies &amp; activities. Paid car &amp; saved nice nest egg. Made $10k+. Definitely silver lining me. Considering major increases cases across country coming Northeast Midwest states, I'm pretty sure weather playing role. expect trend reverse weeks, along lines, Southern states might trouble enough population vaccination time summer hits. Michigan particular hit hard, knows? thing hated management. boss went biweekly team meetings daily meetings. Except call meetings.. like ""we're going breaks... together"". Mostly don‚Äôt want get vaccinated feel tyranny anyone require present passport member society. Yup, it‚Äôs weird. Flu demolished, common colds, much definitions terms lot people think they're introverts probably actually extroverts bad interacting people. words frequently misunderstood almost think they're really useful anymore. Right #NoVaccinePassport trending Twitter, driven UK anti-vaxxers. Imagine highly paid, highly educated, brilliant scientist field epidemiology. wait whole career true test expertise. global pandemic. Then.. arrives thrusted spotlight. dig deep well stocked arsenal knowledge know how. turn public calmly say:

‚ÄúUhhh. Wear mask close restaurants guess?‚Äù US state people high risk can‚Äôt get vaccine yet? reading article also seems recently started vaccinating people well, vaccine currently going elderly part. That‚Äôs really silly sentiment. Many countries going lockdowns can‚Äôt wait couple months current half assed mask mandates quasi-social distancing make sure we‚Äôre actually clear... small number people states fully vaccinated - 30% still small number.

No matter people ‚Äúsupport‚Äù not, black white health outcomes transmission don‚Äôt care feelings politics. fully vaccinated, nothing meaningfully change situation others. Go without fear. Prior infections beneficial reaching herd immunity cost deaths. - completed thought you. 2nd 3rd wave hit? dates waves?  wish got J&amp;J shot less effective single shot Moderna? vaccine risky individual disease itself, you‚Äôve got serious ethical problem. get it, stop spread that. government America tried pull shit, I‚Äôd lose confidence vaccines would longer able trust process.


It's really clear whether benefits outweigh risks certain demographics. health authorities signalling there's chance suspensions, disagree. personal opinion obviously flawed zero science back definitely ""different"" flu shot. Like yeah arm hurt trying sleep annoying forgetting sleep side, could way worse. Round 2 coming days. Omg that‚Äôs terrible. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs taking long. Remember, even minimal restrictions lots places, people still haven‚Äôt gotten covid. It‚Äôs contagious there‚Äôs limit. YES! knees. Really left knee. wild someone know exactly I'm talking about, none friends family haha. ""have to"" unless unduly pressured. 100% May ask that's good? Tss tss... that's fuckin devil number Even clots later proven caused vaccine, clearly understand UK wants continue vaccine. chances die vaccine always low, UK vaccination strategy highly dependent AZ vaccine. 

For EU countries trickier. dependent Pfizer/BioNTech J&amp;J argue stopping vaccination AZ certain groups beneficial health. delays caused pausing AZ certain groups, minimal delays AZ delivered doses. 

So, understand UK certain EU countries like Germany, Denmark Netherlands moving forward way do. won‚Äôt one say safe

No don't. Regulators put public interests' first. Tl:dr they‚Äôre vaccinating slower virus spreading. Yea it‚Äôs fucking brutal us coincidence study performed women men average age around 18. study involving university students 50/50 terms gender little higher age? I'm curious thats initial thoughts are. think someone published study suggesting common sense quite literally exist, consensus exists falls ""common sense."" demographics people michigan getting ? definitely wouldn‚Äôt go far, removing office culture life one of, only, major benefit pandemic. You‚Äôll okay! felt symptoms 2 days. make sure drink plenty water buy Tylenol clear schedule 2 days. mild fever shivers aches pains. However could breathe easily won‚Äôt die. ‚ù§Ô∏è many specific thrombosis events like occur normally though? know data released past data thrombosis experts said normal. can't believe fact take prove (if time frame even correct) normal Yeah meant direct person saying vaccines poison, know amazing evidence show safe large amounts people vaccinated trials haha weeks ago things still uncertain, scary, unvaccinated. didnt know well vaccines would work, rollout shit, people already acting like over

Now concrete science back shit know things WORKING. college person back feeling shit would WORK.

You, however, acting irresponsible like corona virus

I changed opinions due facts. plugged ears listened convenient YOU. No, numbers literally add month position Israel in. They‚Äôve vaccinated enough people fully open hardly spread. US month away vax numbers current pace instead wants open 75k cases day instead waiting 5% longer 10k cases day say true, I‚Äôm pretty sure mods delete post shortly. I'm still betting researcher sent grad students collect samples bat feces, give adequate breathing protection. C‚Äôest bon. Rhinovirus one form common cold. existing coronaviruses besides Covid also common cold. Ohhh! Oops  bosses planting seeds heads soon CDC gives go-ahead big gatherings again, we‚Äôre back office ASAP, dissent accepted considered.

I‚Äôve also TON awful, pointless Zoom meetings last two months, point pandemic. powers clearly trying reassert power reclaim control work environment. Shit sucks üòî ratio deaths new cases gotten much better, vaccination wonders. understand people keep acting like opposition want passports countries. ain't it.

It's passports daily life we're opposed to. replied wrong comment! bad! agree! stand world introverts advantage! J/k love find excuses wearing bra anymore! liberating. live shows bright are. Enjoy 4th surge there. confirm. People most, wearing chin diaper. Two things true introvert, ton hobbies require social interaction. finally time pick old projects previously busy for. Covid actually blessing respect.  changed outlook important. 

That said, I'm it. I'm masks. I'm political strife. I'm us vs. people saying ""baaaaaaa"" argument. Millions people worldwide vaccinated. Hundreds thousands vaccinated trials. many till content? personal opinion what's appropriate necessarily country whole. Crony gotta crony... We're nowhere near herd immunity, dude. easiest way prevent ‚Äúvaccine passports‚Äù every day activities actually get vaccinated. get magic number (whatever is) covid die passports. Otherwise would expect things requiring l proof vaccinations get number. 

Realistically, don‚Äôt think many people hardcore anti vax. real road block ending pandemic people vaccine apathetic hesitant. Millions people worldwide vaccinated.

There's effort hook people rides, mostly grassroots super high vaccine uptake, there's still way people appointments. coworkers driven hour appointments, well, they've eligible. Closer vaccination sites run quickly. rollout super even across state. British? literally go wishes time. government hide via limited press releases pressure lmao Why? happy got vaccine. J&amp;J fantastic vaccine too, you‚Äôd likely fine getting any. sound positively giddy that. would I. would also never make preposterous claim public school teacher immediate presence akin causing lifelong damaging one‚Äôs heart lungs. child US still dying COVID every day, one hospitalized every 8 hours ""If someone looks poor begs money likely give money look well off"". 

Studies shown people likely offer help people identify with. success begging money wearing normal clothes even suit would looking homeless.

People say something ""common sense"" even studies claims something completely false due hindsight bias. Read Baruch Fischoff's work interested.  live extroverted people ignored rules intimidated enforce them. Jesus christ. Whatever. Magic power saying things. Every government lies there's chance dying covid caused blood clot, stop fanny cases lockdown. Vaccinations hopefully allow UK open without case surge, Portugal may little tricky due yet low vaccination levels. MI needs J&amp;J ice cream trucks ASAP.  I‚Äôm actually kidding. Technically, even overproduced. 10 million doses media thee past days: actually planned quarter already got produced March thus could already used. Nah, mine definitely did. undergrad math major classes lectures (no discussion/presentation/labs/etc.) translate really well zoom lose usefulness. online classes fantastic me; saves bunch commute time, saves money food since get pack lunch eat cheap, cuts number people asking dumb questions derailing lecture.

Outside school, interactions happening online means pretty much complete control when/how/with social interactions literally feels like miracle. Sure miss face-to-face interaction zoom D&amp;D friends zoom cards family every week enough feel socially stimulated enough. 0 accountability skipping zoom hangouts leaving early makes everything virtual imo

Honestly obvious, awful health impact Covid, I'd say way forced us operate pretty much ideal.

All long winded way say vouch least people's moods definitely improved covid couple dozen things? Wow, okay. come hundreds. Unless think ""galactic destruction"" ""the rise Cenobites"" big deal. ""we probably need fund study come conclusion category"" first identified UK rather it‚Äôs UK problem meaning word ""block"". say ""block significant level"", that's fact-based see anyone disputing that. say ""block"" without qualifiers, different meaning. implies complete protection, *NYT* article confirms many people interpreted way. Unfortunately, ""complete protection"" contrafactual. would ignoring science, times like these, really need truth. already posted Please also refrain editing titles future. post removed per rules 2 3. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs common experience talking people this. It‚Äôs can‚Äôt won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs thrive people around you. actually handle bigger groups sometimes prefer bigger group. never said hard fast rules. fact, even mentions doesn‚Äôt mean want overcrowded room. means get energy motivation around people stuck inside without social connections Covid-19 quarantine difficult many extroverted people. Again. hard hard rule. what‚Äôs common experience talking people. point it‚Äôll hard stop becoming dominant strain every country. It‚Äôs sucks got variant that‚Äôs much easier spread reducing severity all. 10,000 people average gave 0.8 people would 800 new cases, R0 0.8. 100 people R0 1 100 cases. 

It's estimation also skewed like amount people covid inevitably dropping high amount recoveries compared new infections. However things like mass testing make seem higher, couples aforementioned shit. 

I've probably explained piss poorly, forgive I've smoke haha yes soon go back outside world again.. meh vaccine resistant strain, [we can't find positive believe Israel currently administering Pfizer mRNA vaccine, believe Johnson Johnson vaccine impacted variants significant degree either.

I'm familiar mRNA vaccine, I've yet someone show mutations could reasonably occur within virus would prevent vaccine induced immune response killing still allowing infect humans, especially fantastic adaptive immune system is. convinced idea new variant resisting vaccine inevitability time. possible convinced likely I'm absolutely convinced certain.  working home past year really work differently, best performance review I‚Äôve ever job, like 2 scores higher I‚Äôve ever gotten before... apparently needed watch worked. scale towards introvert definitely experienced improvement overall mood past year. love social events well though ideal situation. work day people coming things spot uncontrolled times wears down. want back office full time might even go see doctor social anxiety something realize much affected work this. Everything diet sleep exercise mental health huge improvement though. hear neighbors, basically live middle nowhere prefer lifestyle though. fellow European: no. long play ball deliver promise, let fulfill orders.

As said: allow exports. go Covax thus help poorer nations. don‚Äôt want situation hog vaccines year later we‚Äôre lockdown mutation f.i. Africa unharmed vaccines. need vaccinate entire world end vaccination needs happen pretty much time. 

When comes AZ, hope crash burn over. Nothing lies deceit them. don‚Äôt trust anything. So, lived OCD done childhood noticed way well. last year I've watched everyone around go pain struggles obsession compulsion regards COVID, well resultant depression anxiety first time felt like weird person room. fact, I'd willing wager lifetime OCD, anxiety depression actually left better prepared psychological effects pandemic. 

Everywhere go see telltale signs others struggling little dose life forty-plus years feel sadness one deserves put this. guess I'm used felt sense dread wife relatives have. first time, I've rock, foundation everyone else lean on.

It's exhausting, know well put together lot handle it. Yeah literally cannot speak zoom unless someone asks direct question lmfao terrible. deaths December January infections. yesterday‚Äôs infections, two weeks deaths continue fall. vaccines less sicker patients. is. Im empathetic families affected. things improving every day. Thanks! Google Yeah, think headline bit misleading. Even someone social anxiety, still prefer around people regardless. ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù heavier objects fell faster lighter ones. catch colds cold. Many common sense intuitions regards probability large numbers - take Monty Hall problem example problem common sense misleading. people look health dieting common sense lenses time draw wrong conclusions. there‚Äôs racist examples - ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù supported number racist idea policies years. UK women really won‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening either way, they? seems UK choosing hide information rather get bottom this. 

And plethora excellent vaccines available, can‚Äôt help read stance anything callous disregard lives young women.

I applaud countries committed truth transparency. Hiding information kills people, fuels global anti-vax sentiment. 

I‚Äôm certain American disappointed UK government today. see point. kind line water wet kind study vs surface tension water? Misunderstanding, see

I think everything open up, im talking shit open 5 months almost everyone vaccinated. I'm still masking I'm going places now. college making decisions based happening NOW, likely, 2x many people fully vaccinated september caught fear. worse things kids. scarlet fever kid, I'd rather covid. agree 100%. Especially countries like India honestly going take year get vaccinated herd immunity. may need roll boosters even they're completing first round. there's Brazil stewing away like is. got mine weeks ago husband nervous wasn't. struggled first routine disruption, found work much better washing machine dishwasher background semi-sentient humanoid ‚Äúcoworkers‚Äù screeching, howling staggering cube farm around me. boss urging us come occasionally office open ‚Äúvoluntarily‚Äù can‚Äôt think reason don‚Äôt task need site for. Zoom meetings godawful I‚Äôd rather spend hours webcam whole day desk. Ya think I've working home 1-3 days week since like 2016. Despite experience, losing days office last year still really fucked overall schedule. Separating work time home time, chores, keeping regular schedule, ect.

My commute always really long miserable I'm done 3-5 days office, I'm really looking forward able 2 again. really enough hold everything together. reality epidemiology mature field, anyone admitted this, would relegate epidemiology status say... theoretical physics. That's say, would academic pursuit key applications, one would making world-changing decisions based theories.

Predicting disease spread particular conditions possible. Predicting human behavior creates conditions far possible. give recommendations, comes connecting models policy, predict human behavior, experts spitballing like everyone else regard. introvert, that's definitely true all. like alone time, need social interaction get depressed. Zoom calls make incredibly depressed, I'm physically around people. voice call replacement chatting person, never be.  There's kinds folk wisdom ready answer situations show common sense. true?

1. Absence makes heart grow fonder.

2. sight, mind.

Psychological research indicated latter accurate. workplace trying make sure ‚Äúcompany culture‚Äù adapted scheduled bunch different weekly zoom activities. Weekly coffee chat, craft hour, trivia, etc. sound great theory, I‚Äôm already spending 8 hours staring computer screen every day. desire spend even time staring coworkers computer screen, even otherwise fun activity Could seasonal effect: Portugal way better weather UK, UV index Lisbon 7 compared 2 London. *you‚Äôre* vaccinated think everything open up?

Sorry, one‚Äôs safe everyone safe. functional level, behaviour *everything* case numbers. people stay away other, cases fall. congregate indoors whatever reason, transmission occurs cases rise. simple science. whole sweep thing gets tricky majority population immunity. vaccines do. 

This probably end. hate pants! misread. Massachusetts. father absolutely livid place supposed get first shot apparently system supposed book first second shot advance, booked first one second one, literally told help try somewhere else, everywhere else booked right now. seen pissed long time. idea ""group five"" thing coming from. I'm extroverted talk anyone one one small groups, enjoy events large numbers people feel like fishbowl. think immunity absolutely biggest thing. Infection yields amount immunization. That's fact virtually every virus- viruses characteristic essentially defined unusual is.

The restrictions initially place slow everyone getting infected, time went transformed trying prevent anyone getting infected wait immunization vaccine. We're point, everyone vaccinated.

It mathematically inevitable states prevented consistently large numbers infections past year would get massive boost things open towards end. they? uninfected defenseless without immune system familiarity, whether that's virus vaccine.

The question basically three part issue now:

* opening things towards end leads inevitable case increase, vaccination effort quick comprehensive enough prevent heavy restriction states similar death numbers light restriction states?

* Assuming statistically noticeable difference deaths heavy restriction states light restriction states over, difference large enough justify difference first place?

* restrictions helpful forging difference deaths, consequences restrictions turned unhelpful costs outweigh benefits minds people?

**None** going get answered end year. We're probably going debating second question especially rest lives. also bit tangent, speculate two biggest factors whose importance we're going learn time goes obesity Vitamin D. Japan biggest example this, negligible obese population fish heavy diets. restrictions comparable United States European Union, suffer pandemic nearly much them. think going cultural shake learn worst year lives largely caused extremely unhealthy lifestyle choices, that's going major, major wedge discussion restrictions contributed logistical ethical scale. links credible sources support claim? vaccines referring to? cancer treatments.. sure hope booster shots aren‚Äôt necessary, it‚Äôs surely smarter trials data. think it‚Äôs smart there‚Äôs also trials mixing vaccines know need boosters stick original vaccine. It‚Äôs going take rest world get vaccinated US may need info, countries might. Yeah, looking data seems like uncharacteristically low days week, I'm thinking might seeing catching reporting doses. understanding poor. time drive car cross street seeing similar risks he's afraid here. Exactly!

And correct say ""oh stay house forever"" find something else freak about"". simply stating facts means house bound freaking something. 

The people equate facts kind overarching fear ones uneducated background science research data. um, toxic abusive family does. Yeah, think right. harder know fall cases due lockdown vaccination, I'm Portugal infection rate fell even sharply even though much behind UK vaccination. However improving CFR certainly due vaccine (since vaccinating vulnerable first). disagree ""we idea"" effect mRNA booster would agree gold-standard RCT study data prove (yet) additional rigor would needed actually doling shots way. However, problem medical journalism related epistimology claim RCTs kind valid ""evidence"". 

However studies trials covering every permutation variables available time, may never done. Gold standard RCTs great ""ground truths"" need working model fill gaps them. means rely understanding vaccines work fill knowledge gaps. impacts treatment decisions, also public policy decisions. Decisions make today vaccine capacity, targets, strategy affect fall beyond. need plan probable, proven.

We substantial experience animal models analytical models human immunity guide process vaccine development inform us ""null"" hypothesis be. 

The vaccines mostly work presenting immune system irritating antigens, mostly COVID vaccines antigens mimic spike protein SARS2 allows enter h-ACE2 rich cells respiratory epithelium.  Mostly, additional vaccine doses create stronger immune response.  actually measure # antibody units per mL dosing animals almost always see go cross dosing regardless type vaccine antigen source. couple caveats this, example: Vector vaccines may issues 2nd dose; immune system generate immunity vector itself, rather ""payload"" antigens. far know, barring rare allergies, mRNA vaccines limitation - basically turn cells pure irritating antigen factories. saRNA tech recursive MRNA coding technology makes cells turn MRNA vaccine factories thus sub uL doses possible. already bunch real world human data 0, 1, 2 mRNA vaccine doses ""natural"" infection, see antibodies continue climb (although increase 1 2 shots natural infection super big). 

Most vaccines, except AZ similar ""payload"". AZ vaccine missing one part others have, may explain seems poor efficacy south african strain EEK mutation. lieu real-world data, also take blood vaccinated people see well binds proteins SARS varrants &amp; strains. see Moderna, Pfizer, Novavax generally produce much stronger response J&amp;J AZ vaccine lab tests.

So think almost certain mRNA vaccines used universal booster shot. quickly tweak antigen payload match EEK mutation well. hope whoever threw gets covid I‚Äôm torn article tbh. understand families must extremely painful get close - must especially devestating family whose loved one died contracting virus days shot, immunity kicked in.

However, always going happen people, can‚Äôt give everyone vaccine immediately, logistically it‚Äôs impossible - 75 year old offered vaccine january actually extremely fast. get it‚Äôs cold comfort family it‚Äôs left behind forgotten state, must amongst first get call. Vaccines treatment COVID preventative measure. situation unfortunate, vaccine kept alive Wow, increase 500K+. Excellent! think pretty wide open interpretation.

&amp;#x200B;

An introvert lost everything going devastated. extro got work home cut living expenses two thirds moving hours cities going give statistics expect. Inaccurate metric.  I'm introvert. first loved home time off. started struggling financially, stress went again. third lockdown really hate it. like socialization still even like time. little better nothing all. able afford rent nice too. see lockdown brings. üôÑ Yeah. Short attention spans. Smol pp. believe last Saturday 3.5M Needs go courts. Seems unconstitutional. Eating low fat food = reducing fat body Yeah would assume coming. Tbqh Janssen, Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax would 100 percent gucci offered one. would declined AZ lot people sub really hate hearing particular truth, lol. get desperately want believe vaccines 100% effective, misleading statements CDC media helping. need live truth. Lol Florida wide open months they're A-Ok half people thread straight antisocial something? get impression y'all want pandemic end would make lifestyle less ""socially acceptable"". 

I would generally consider introvert, much problem occupying solitary activities, fuck, able sit cafe eat restaurant, much less travel, absolutely *sucks* going like long has. WFH commute nice first, mental separation work home gradually dwindled nonexistence, actually started miss going office. already hated job even pandemic. believe 2000 deaths mRNA vaccines US, articles I've read. I'd love know true said death current vaccines 1 60,000 whole regular flu shots 1 million. believe article said sourced Vers database. sales people scum waste insane money frivolous trips unnecessary shit name business. people would boil question take AZ shot lower efficacy, much lower efficacy SA variant, odd link blood abnormalities, drive extra 20 minutes get Pfizer Moderna shot, get J&amp;J shot get single trip. I'd rather go slightly way get one three. 

The influx AZ would add top current availability three, quickly becoming quite robust. Well, good thing vaccines effective them! Well hasn‚Äôt simple San Diego while, honest, last time looked two weeks ago. local board posts still sounds difficult get appt. people actually root people die states like Texas Florida proven right according political affiliations. entire medical record though, ""did get vaccine yet not?""
And since id assume people getting vaccine anyways, big deal? got vaccine (out choice necessity/availability) tough luck need people vaccinated beat this.

And agree going take implement probably get going, like 2024 gonna even use still use all.
I think quite 1984 Seriously. consider introverted extroverted, people thread gushing much love see family makes think ""if related want spend time anyway"" I've gotten buried mentioning actually another study reported extroverts fared much better pandemic found ways maintain human connections despite lockdown, whereas introverts generally stopped initiating responding contact. news feed weeks ago. find again, I'll link it. absurd. We‚Äôve heard ‚Äúfollow science‚Äù lot past year. refusing follow now? 

I‚Äôm hoping CDC get better/stronger messaging change people‚Äôs minds. usual amount walking/ hiking outside, usual amount total fun outside. felt pretty recommended go outside everyday. Still feels weird too, I'm trying check instinctively judgmental gotten together voice chat play games friends? Plus novavax j&amp;j. I'm still sceptical vaccines less effective variants; mRNA vaccines. What? go back previous statement? It‚Äôs respiratory virus. Covid affects much lungs. People die Covid strokes, look since you‚Äôve never heard it. GI pain, body aches, hair falling out, none respiratory symptoms, yet experts continue label Covid Corona Virus clearly not. never reason expect would less severe. virus already spread incredibly well one way infectious efficient replicating humans. could way off, also view NYC office status thing. reason pay crazy high rent example. everyone remote, there's really reason office somewhere affordable, office, depending company.

Well...that's true basically every person earth pandemic. lot substance don‚Äôt see tragedy someone infected dying close safe? assure family does. facility investigated following protocols.

Not really. Irony, maybe? really tragic. cut life... Could explain neighboring Indiana cases positivity slightly growing. Deaths continue fall, hospitalizations still low. huge spike fall. pandemic put second doses give first doses 5% population.

MMW I've got interested layman's understanding keep mind. 

As far know single biggest thing mRNA vaccines they're platform rather single vaccine. theory much easier build vaccine something using majority work already done, need synthesise RNA codes identifiable feature vaccinating relatively much easier designing traditional vaccine.

In terms therapies could useful stable system uses body's cells synthesise things various known factors much substance produced given dose quickly mRNA decays could high degree control much substance delivered time. obvious candidate would various hormone therapies used currently possibilities well. 

A days ago story hormone inactivated mice caused missing teeth start regrow. pans something like would work humans mRNA vector could cause body manufacture suppressing protein would ideal way that.

The avenue therapies prospect highly customised medicines.

I like around people choose around choose around them. surprised said introverts better, tbh. thought everyone hard time across board.

You're hearing people unhappy. extroverts, they're especially loud it. See Scientific American article Wednesday seems indicate immune system evolve fight variants, least ones seen critical states ‚Äî like Texas, Mississippi, Florida Arkansas ‚Äî rolling back COVID-19 restrictions, saying leaders showing ‚ÄúNeanderthal thinking.‚Äù 

I seen quote. anyone tell said this? eerily reminiscent behavior shown previous president..  CDC can‚Äôt stick stance whether still spread Covid post-vaccination lol Introvert here.

Better hurry vaccinate then. willing keep beyond year. thought y'all called everyone said ""stay safe!!' selfish asshole

You cant win here, taking argument contest True, that's *are* vaccinating people, definitely big priority countries pandemic still raging. approved FDA. EUA thing actual approval. percentage admissions, it‚Äôs incorrect they‚Äôre seeing younger people; mostly since older people vaccinated far less likely admitted. Hospitalization numbers still spiralling control, think whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs killing younger‚Äù notion media‚Äôs new scare tactic know mRNA vaccines work incredibly well known variants. Heard lot people talking hard work alone. I'm really looking forward face large open plan offices again. Fannie üòú Ooh. like that. Ambiverts. yeah hard fast rules. Yeah. mean, *do* argue people stay home... little longer. we've come far, would sadly ironic spread virus last two months we're close herd immunity. whole point pandemic works population, individual, level.

Fully vaccinated people could maybe hang outdoors small groups right now, still cautious. even they're gonna whatever want months, least know facts. I‚Äôm sorry world doesn‚Äôt cater every wish Maybe creating society around one standard personality type bad idea maybe flexible moving forward? definitely is, also delays reporting. 

The last day government say unreported cases March 27th 30. 

What important 7 day average hospitalisations death dropping 30% every week couple months. 

And apart hiccup schools reopened cases going too, quickly, fact due schools using lateral flow issue significant number false positives belatedly decided double check pcr. Common enough know 6+ long haulers. 6 people whose lives upended, real end sight. ones told directly happened read Facebook. doesn‚Äôt include presumed many didn‚Äôt announce algorithm didn‚Äôt show me. research then? 100%. think they‚Äôre decent really disgusting people there. Can‚Äôt wait pandemic ends don‚Äôt hear again. Yeah whole ‚Äúnot fully fda approved‚Äù thing die soon. 

Vaccines require 6 months data ‚Äúfull‚Äù fda approval, Pfizer released 6 month data showing safety concerns (as expected). 

They ‚Äúfull‚Äù FDA approval year. Pointless article, mention variants. UK one dominating scene now, much transmissible deadly OG Covid. Also big brainer unvaccinated working class communities color hit harder wave, that‚Äôs case pandemic. sub fine tho cause many people arguing fine wealthy white folks snag shots meant vulnerable POC communities ‚Äúany shots arms good thing,‚Äù right? Yes, you‚Äôll likely fine. people get you, get whoever gets you? research, don‚Äôt believe true believe enough testing trails done solidify statement. end day bottom heart hope vaccines provide robust immunity variants. think introverts thrive best alone.

And ambiverts ones thrive small groups, amongst people already know. catch colds cold.

This one validity. cold weakens immune system. outside sneezy mcgoober coughs direction, likely get sick first shed light student athletes Michigan. hoping find someone like lol. I'm introvert social life almost non existent. rarely gone last one year TBH last 1 year felt like normal me. difficulty many Zoom calls, I‚Äôm introvert. me, problem virtual hangouts make difficult read non-verbal cues


For me, Zoom calls preferable communicating all. Thank much! People Japan wear masks they're feeling sick. never legally enforced people need wear masks Japan, pandemic otherwise. Masks silver bullet prevent transmissions. work way.

A majority people follow mask etiquette Japan, majority people follow mask mandates United States. occasional video woman crabby change fact people wear masks go store train. Polling indicated mask compliance high, even people like it.

Masks magic. ridiculous ask like they're perfect tool preventing transmission virus. Also can't speak social distancing past year, someone went Japan absolutely ""socially distance"" normal circumstances. I've never physically close wide array people life. give actual source wide scale differences distancing past year Japan versus United States, videos screenshots individuals complaining it, I'll take point seriously. date her. sayin. shit sherlock ! sounds like school problem bullying. not. said got infected subsequently hospitalized days facility scheduled vaccinated. one, vaccines immediate, two, probably helped anyway. infection hospitalized hun probably contracted several days presentation symptoms. daft.

Transmission *within* household hard prevent regardless much time able spend away home (which still going less time spend home, almost definition). Transmission *between* households virus spreads population - people tend swap households much, else spread?

The answers clear while, theory practice. Lockdowns (i.e. stopping inter-household mixing) effective, (and remain) first line defence novel pathogen. used next time happens. course, also terribly inconvenient. They‚Äôre plans moment. definitely true introvert. like *around* people. contrary, love hanging people. love crowds going big gatherings. would almost say need around/among people sometimes. *socializing* (talking making conversation) wears take break. yeah, pandemic killed mental state. introverts prefer isolation.  live boonies get 2mbps download speed, good day. Probably one times poor internet services came handy.  Perhaps, NYC gov officials behind scenes want employees go back office, can't imagine different anywhere else states. There's much infrastructure build around people commuting going work. headline super misleading though. It‚Äôs people don‚Äôt want get vaccinated, it‚Äôs moved priority groups quickly everyone currently eligible already got shot. government shifting supply regions since Montreal‚Äôs case numbers still holding relatively stable.

Hopefully they‚Äôll open 55+ group front line workers like teachers coming days, seems like everyone 60+ already gone. Appreciate article time. 

‚Äúthere current evidence suggesting vaccine-resistant mutation exists country (Israel). 

So study specific Israel. Don‚Äôt know could conclude it‚Äôs specific entire world larger countries less ability contain virus. Israel handled pandemic well reading don‚Äôt think variant would spread there. Nevertheless, reassuring true. I‚Äôm trying argue anyone don‚Äôt understand downvotes lol would like read concrete evidence support claim vaccines cover variants. happens scare young people believing covid poses threat them. Extreme introverts did. like hanging people all.

Moderate introverts ambiverts first liked sensory overload, several months got bored wanted *some* social events. 

Moderate extreme extroverts hated Day 1. What's qualifications seem know lot? Absolutely. ^ 100% It‚Äôs requiring undergo medical procedure participate society, requiring show proof possibly everyday mundane things people business knowing part medical record. certainly little inconvenience. comments introverts introverts dominate online spaces. interaction without messy humanity all. recent years introverted even become point pride.

Good them.

The rest us extroverts wondering crossbar closet support weight try hang ourselves. happens lol

but yes, that's point combination first place probably means pharmacist bad needle technique, won‚Äôt affect effectiveness vaccine. Yes! house longer designated party house extended family. even eat food refrigerator without told, ""That weekend."" I‚Äôm talking economic damage, tragic loss life mental toll it‚Äôs taken people. Taking vacation abroad wait. first dose already 80-90% effective preventing infection 100% effective preventing death. 

Unless interacting lot people day work directly COVID patients really concerned. depends look - midnight 3 prime vaccine appt finding times.  live Michigan tell anecdotally likely reason surge everyone vacationing warmer locations insufferably long winter (it snowed couple days ago). know ton people Florida Cancun right spring break aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet they‚Äôre healthy 50. Kind terrified return next week go back work school. 

I 3 little ones including 2 month old managed get covid, really don‚Äôt want almost finish line. I‚Äôm half vaccinated probably still gonna lay low next month least. 

Even though vaccinations available everyone 16 next couple weeks, predict big spring break surge places.

But would preferred get JnJ shot (I got Moderna). would much rather go back next shot couple weeks. JnJ vaccine prevents severe fatal Covid, also provides great protection mild Covid. ease single shot, combined everyone else vaccinated, seems much easier.  famous? first Pfizer dose Thursday. side effect injection site soreness. could mean seen something like carrier virus before, that's people reacting to. 

Do hang around chimps lot? :) That's important thing: still get it, smaller chance, still HOWEVER get vaccinated less severe chances hospitalization and/or death like 0%. Yep, sometimes kids get sick lasting effects! brother flu kid asthma ever since. like early 2000s. ...

They sure fucking dude, lag weeks behind case rates. 

So like clockwork, Michigan hospitalization rates spiked right I'm alarmist. LITERALLY happening Michigan. Deny reality want Michigan surge, mask mandates higher vaccination rates national literally every metric we're spiking *do* hate, however, finding reasons avoid zoomcalls friends family sounds like system fine, patients collapsing. absurd take. There‚Äôs tons recent real-world data coming vaccines they‚Äôre performing similarly trials. [Relevant would agree there‚Äôs enough ambiguity might right there‚Äôs also surveys showing roughly half republicans currently don‚Äôt plan taking vaccine (compared 11% democrats 30% independents). Also, would expect rural areas would stock less vaccine serve smaller population.

It also may regional. NY, Republican friends plan taking it, even conspiratorially minded. Could remember nearly constant scream ambulances last March. theory, think knowing someone died plays role motivating people get vaccinated. got Covid Im fucking ASEXUAL! lol Sounds like got stomach bug, similar feelings eating scrambled eggs Whole Foods salad bar (I'm assuming eggs). weekend bloated stomach churned churned, like stomach turned knot untied.

Family another state, got Moderna, everyone state seeming get Pfizer. think distro. They've got CVS distributing state, got Walgreens. 18 million people AZ. believe 55. estimate around 3 million younger. puts rate factor 6. friends family got Moderna. got J&amp;J first available area.


Side effects mild one shot family second Moderna dose. 


5 hours J&amp;J shot, got mild headache nice fatigue. 
Day 2 woke sore worse headache still wicked tired. 
Day 3 yesterday felt good. morning, arm still tender nothing else amiss. 


Be gentle yourself. may get worse side effects, side effects similar mine, side eat all.


I liked getting side effects made feel like immune system grasping seriousness situation. Same. kinda never want home spending 13 months small studio apartment. Introverted here, suffered mood decline. element choice taken me; wanted go place mean place would open, number me.

There difference CHOOSING stay home vs FORCED stay home. I‚Äôm social introvert. enjoy social interactions draining me. need alone time recharge. Extroverts *get*energy interactions. Agree statistics , coronavirus wrecking havoc even 45-60 age range India. Hospitals overrun lot people would usually survive US there. still easily kill people

Stop that. UK gets decent supply vaccines, sure. 

Given there's decent chance adenovirus that's responsible wonder J&amp;J vaccine sits this? hear 2nd shot one watch for. Loving strategy. second doses Pfizer? keep acceptance rates vaccines high now, they'll impenetrable wall immunity. Love stay hell away form lol Jesus actually fucking spiking dude. know sub turned relentless circle jerk positive news, hospital system region shut visitors again, multiple businesses closing due outbreaks, county stone's throw away breaking records cases. highest vaccination rates state.

Y'all bury head sands much want, Michigan well truly already new wave. tighter restrictions states.

Y'all pretending things fine, Michigan, cases way up, hospitalizations way up. concerning never got rid restrictions test lot states. UK also exports ingredients essential Pfizer vaccine

In significant quantity. amount increase exponentially logistics! Great news nonetheless! health declined shoved double cheeseburger many mysterious chemicals face, delicious. got second Moderna shot yesterday - I‚Äôm guessing developed fever shivering like crazy 12 hours shot, lasted hours woke morning totally fine aside arm pain. expecting much worse! Teenagers, hear. Pfizer two days ago. Misted got shot, waited 15 minute observation, drove back get work done. Tears happiness! Triggered much guess true. husband became eligible week opened 16+ state (I've already mine since I'm teacher eligible early). tried looking appointments him, everything booked. People would tell us new appointments drop midnight, 2 whatever, certain websites continually refresh, etc. like, jobs kids. can't make vaccine hunting another full time job. can't travel 100+ miles get one. We're anti-vaxx means, right away hard find appt. anywhere close us. 

He actually get signed local mass vax event next weekend someone sent around flyer work. think lot people boat - they'll take one get easily, going spend day every day trying find appointment.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thanks thoughtful response. 

As US, there's debate exporting them, concern right we're hit much worse countries (although Brazil India catching fast).  argument address worst first -- home. 

(Of course, easy make argument US created problem #1 reckless measures meant slow spread, there's too...) Also, temperature. Covid spreads optimally around 11¬∞C. early spring ideal time Michigan. Furthermore UK agencies seem think equally spread age, oddly also gender. 18 million UK figure include lot elderly got AZ first, seemingly much risk blood clot response? Would interesting UK release many young healthy gotten AZ vaccine vs number cases group. necessarily. Group 6 contains lot healthy people, like me, unpaid carer elderly/disabled. Vaccination stop getting covid passing unvaccinated people risk.

The risk reduced still easily kill people observing control measures. Second Pfizer fine hey muscle wise day Thank :) I'm fine mild covid year ago still got antibodies. soooo jealous seeing american friends getting back life. NHS running UK vaccinations. It‚Äôs socialized medicine. got Moderna reaction first, 2nd 8 hours later 101 fever, aches, chills, tired next day half. Went sleep 101.5 fever feeling shitty, woke 97.7 feeling perfect. 100% worth it. Also apparently younger stronger immune system reaction take account. I'm 28 get sick every years probably one stronger reactions I've heard friends Well, India median population age 26.8 , compared USA 38.1. 6% indians aged 64. So, kinda logical greater portion population taking COVID lightly. saying smart, expected. Send AZ.  don‚Äôt need drama places already using could arms tomorrow. necessarily - healthcare workers mostly given pfizer vaccinated AZ available, back late dec/early jan. see paper indicating Moderna different regard. export ban US really matter Pfizer never planned export single dose US US market saturated. always going America first. get people want steal doses countries‚Äô delivery commitments, strongly disagree. work good last months. Masks everywhere, positive cases, protocols followed (somewhat) everyone stopped caring. we've 7 employees one week test positive. frustrating seem making progress start falling backwards Sempre em frente man, em breve redes privadas v√£o vacinar tamb√©m e ai processo acelera Fake news, export ban UK. UK also exports ingredients essential Pfizer vaccine production actively involved supply chains. Found Sun reader. talk UK's one dose strategy crushing it. 7 day case death averages hot fire. Yeah great me. hate crowds people going office. Working home, never seeing anyone husband daughter, perfect introvert. Michigan's hospitalizations spiking dude. 

My county already points December. highest vaccine rates state.

Our hospital shut visitors again.


I think guys realize, Michigan already rates last surge. Including well truly new wave, vaccination rates higher national average, still mask mandates gathering limits.

I personally know six people gotten covid last week, job shut due outbreak two people thirties currently hospital. Michigan first decline, first spike back up.

Again, region already back numbers saw last wave, vaccinate national average. Or, none triage resources actually limited? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs quirky preference also probably also shouldn‚Äôt die for. Casually advocating genocide fucking bizarre. Could Norovirus - that‚Äôs going around. Husband week 2 weeks ago Good. old people can‚Äôt even more. stay home anyway. Vaccinate virus spreaders can‚Äôt spread it. Moderna's production Switzerland nearly enough mass-supply whole world.

Which countries thinking about? ones big pharma presence, good environment function hub, either already banning exports, receiving supply EU domestic production nearly enough (which even case UK!). guess Switzerland would exception, know whether alone could level entire EU. experience doesn‚Äôt line this. introverted (or thought), crave social interaction large, massive groups. Soon enough. really. US banned export December. 

The UK says DONT EXPORT BAN. LOL. Yes do. way say cases falling way makes look like know something others don't. arguing pretty defensive way. Funny conservatives like ""9/11!"" thought two million dead americans nothing seems like women 55 could offered Pfizer rest population AstraZeneca would avoid vast majority unusual blood clots. Obviously I‚Äôm looking simplistic manner though, know Australia lot remote areas storage issue AstraZeneca vaccine ideal (but, conversely getting medical help might also difficult). deliveries EU Q2 average 16M per week extra export sure awesome output EU supply chain! 

I think lot people EU don‚Äôt realize much deliveries Q2 increase. numbers always wrong?  Almost [160 million received one genuinely curious. I'm staying strict 2 weeks 2nd dose. 32yo buddy still needs o2 tank 3 months later Sorry man. Hoping production keeps getting ramped soon. Texan here. I've seeing lot maskless morons recent weeks. another surge, lack trying science denying fuckwads. agree held responsible solving issues due AZ, hand lesser evil in

A) Annoying company that's done could EU saving countless lives within EU stopping exports

or

B) Allowing doses shipped EU away vulnerable struggling EU. problem damn contracts signed biontech like EARLY last summer. 

70 Million Month EU amount 7 Million fully vaccinated per month Germany, 60 Million adults Germany full vaccinated. 

That problem, problem biontech all, beef German govt fucking us here, leaving vaccine alliance MONTHS wasted vaccine negotiations.... god knows many lock downs , dead people billions needed pay price numbers always wrong?  Almost 160 million received one dose. makes sense. extrovert saw needs pretty clearly able make special arrangements meet social needs. think sometimes introverts don‚Äôt consider social needs late they‚Äôre stuck pattern.  Thats fine dont require likes loves, karma means jack me. stating facts ""ignorant"" glean reality fiction lost cause telling them. anyone actually looks, statements confirmed verifiable, unlike whatever sources getting info from. 

Sounds like people disagreeing either Enquirer Subscriptions, watch much Fox News (which comedy best, dark humor racism taken account), both, confused monumentally ignorant statement ""fake news"". guess i'm introverted...? 

i grew lot person covid was/am focusing personal development, events/obligations distract me. personally, needed kind break get shit together. wish many people die/negatively impacted it. first AZ first Moderna Pfizer Monday due government clue stock pharmacies second AZ dose.

And no, im anti-lockdown, follow rules perfectly, soon pandemic over, im burning masks pyre. Please... can't take database already. feel extra bad people lived alone pandemic. can't imagine lonely would be, that's coming someone pretty far introvert end scale. extrovert, lockdown slowly killing me. feels like year continual headache. don‚Äôt necessarily need talk people, love lot people around creates certain atmosphere, especially people good time. love festivals, museums, breweries, packed restaurants, cruises, etc. hubbub makes feel good.

I curious though. He's got good polling numbers moment. wonder response be. anything ""we start removing mask mandates"", he's going shooting credibility large portion country, foot. Misery loves company often take pleasure solitary activities reading, writing, meditating. introvert likely enjoy time spent alone find less reward time spent large groups people. Introverts easily overwhelmed much stimulation social gatherings engagement, introversion even defined terms preference quiet, minimally stimulating external environment.

Social isolation exclusive state introverts exist in. preferred selection activities create environment social isolation. confirm Michigan weather bullshit lately. either freezing cold, raining, 20 mph winds, sometimes once. Yet deaths free fall. don‚Äôt care infections long people aren‚Äôt dying, less less day. Agreed. introverted, still need social interaction. hard getting little time friends. introversion means need alone time recharge social events, means I'm selective want spend time settings, mean socializing still real need.

I realize basically rewrote comment different words, wanted show feel exactly relate heavily. zero need describe original version renaming specific country . is, however, need easily describe variants. looked death rates age bracket China later confirmed Italy concluded I'll take risk.

Unfortunately government, supported fear monger people, locked whole shit able normal life anyways. don‚Äôt care making one million chances seem like surefire guarantees here. mean..... it‚Äôs already going going decades. Traveling abroad certain countries REQUIRED show vaccine passport sorts directly CDC. 

You wanna go public school aren‚Äôt date vaccines? Sorry... can‚Äôt let in. really really really need calm down. course overreacting.

if two shot vaccine already likely higher efficacy ""fully"" immune J&amp;J person. relative.

millions people flew pandemic (some good reasons, not) likely flying spread COVID interactions upon landing. flying devil.

it sounds like sending brother away interact him? see issue. I‚Äôm introverted absolutely absolutely absolutely love WFH

Best time life honestly Covid

My mood improved much period

Thank God People keep saying strict restrictions, really don't. strict recommendations, sure, enforced lot businesses opening back up. mom's entire bowling team got exposed weeks ago, bowling alley enforcing masking distancing. mom's fully vaccinated since New Year, fine, lot bowlers quarantined right now. data supports especially indoor dining. Something ‚Äúfeel‚Äù safe actually accounts 1.5% cases (indoor, outdoor, bars combined) it‚Äôs main driver also went inside people vaccine strongly it. reality, side effects relatively minor. side effects expect first shot like mix tetanus flu shot (sore arm maybe fever). second shot harsher, unlike cold mild flu day so. cases, side effects due immune system reacting thinks real virus.

The exception small number people, literally 1 million, experience anaphylaxis, people required wait least 15 minutes post vaccination ensure allergic reaction. Said allergic reaction highly treatable everywhere vaccinations prepared deal rare event. california first day vaccinated 500,000 people 1 day *among college students. big caveat. College students were, course, affected pandemic many ways, mostly social (which findings make sense). However, much less likely (on average, course) affected pandemic comes economic security health. basically findings suggest among young people likely healthy well off, social isolation distancing detrimental extroverts somewhat beneficial introverts. 

Post title misleading suggests findings generalizeable are. Absolutely nothing changed day day routine covid. wear mask instead wearing one Thank you! That's really impressive week week increase, IMO.  downvotes? risk redditors taking vaccines people risk. disgusting. whole year claimed good guys. selfish, soon vaccine comes they're first take away need.

They care old people. scared virus afraid admit that. U.K. variant actually deadly all. Keep date. Less likely like... 95%. Think back March last year. never tried go back live normal life again, would feel virus, given everything said online news? never took leap going back world realize sky wasn‚Äôt falling. Many vaccines reduced efficacy E484K variants, added mutations well. T-cells come save day. people nice titers broadly effective adaptive immune responses. people not. problem lies variants. Immune compromised people epically long cases - 115 days long - folks problem. People love rules clear, I'm sorry diversity people there, diversity variants, making less black white would like.

Crazy high reproduction number, suspecting. India's (and Bangladesh's Pakistan's) government something ASAP. close end pandemic bringing eternal lockdown people full-force gripe might well talking brick wall kept bothering seen linked another subreddit. know vaccine 100 percent, person coronavirus fully vaccinated symptomatic, um.. (if true). Thoughts? Nice see people standing nonsense. spent time sub you‚Äôd think people actually like lockdowns. People ideas. science agrees them, they're ""facts science"" soon doesn't, willfully ignore data like anti-maskers April 2020. There's many places rollercoasters. Stepping limb here, based username feel like talking Disney. I'll use Disney example.

If Disney require masks everywhere, people would taking places apropriate. Like outdoor queues social distancing always respected. bottle necks walking paths.

It's easier blanket policy. Many staff lower income and/or minorities don‚Äôt trust due past unethical medical testing minorities Almost 2% increase single day. That's amazing.

And hurray 65+ demo reaching 75% 80% now! Paywall. OP post text. Maybe us used sustained high levels cases, Japan trying contain cases keep outbreak minimal. closer zero Covid strategy whatever call strategy US Western Europe. Yessss! exactly like that. Like someone joking around tried pinching kneecap. Soooo weird haha. I'm grateful got shot 1 way better expected. Would truly awesome happen second. I'll take weird leg thing day! Even still, I'm ready worse haha. yeah thinking thing. defintely people arthritis that. wonder manage must painful too.  Lack thinking. Cannot fathom mood could improved pandemic I‚Äôm comfortable accepting extrovert label on. Never, ever, never want isolated friends, family, work colleagues potential new acquaintances small amount percentage last year. New variant better infecting kids, spreading schools daycares kids bring back home parents. introvert. shut-in. work teacher, school every single day year in-person (one states). enjoy spending time family, select friends. But, yes, to-the-max introvert, work 50+ hours around tons needly little humans, definitely shut-in.

That said, people both. neither bad. is. COVID-19 basically took turn second wave Spanish Flu, mutating become significantly dangerous. vaccines, would entering worst period pandemic. Little late game Wolverine...

üòëüòëüòë vaccine passport mean mandated get vaccine. choose get tested everytime fly...I travel internationally lot would prefer know everyone else vaccinated negative test. holding up? got light chills around midnight felt feverish fever, slept pretty much feel residual body soreness, hopefully doesn‚Äôt come
And go waves?? afaik, original virus wuhan mutated european variant super early spread around world. UK variant within last two months less gone single digits 80%+ completely displaced european variant. He's ordinary person though. spent $15k trip according him, major shareholder Disney stock. made pretty clear speaking Deputies he's ordinary person...he's special. UK routine anyone 30 show proof age every time want buy alcohol. Personally, think wrong, vaccine passport would actually show less restricted photo proof vaccine. rocks, end April number Israel currently first doses documented cases vaccinated people spreading it? problem, jealous way. annoy me, posting pic's, wanting people compliment look bathing suit, pics resort, etc... like go vegas times year since live Canada, can't go. Ya sucks moan government ruining life. Plus, get older, need see people bathing suits anymore ;-) one thing dampen mood able cross bridge Detroit visiting favorite restaurants.  almost single digit deaths, delayed method huge win. Agreed basically since received shots-I less good meet friend family. feel confident going restaurants outside general duh. mean, I‚Äôm ok saying someone chooses get vaccinated gets it, that‚Äôs them... considering it‚Äôs still approved kids, I‚Äôm comfortable saying general yet. Going bar non- kid friendly show without mask months now, every adult chance get it? Sure. really hoping people continue wear masks anywhere frequented children get too. realize kids don‚Äôt get sick, do, I‚Äôd rather situation children either keep staying home forever risk adults tired wearing masks. makes lot sense. I'm retail worker back February whole thing broke got similar symptoms Covid, nothing crazy bad. Really minor head cold. what's interesting note two colleagues worked closely came really nasty flu. One (the store manager) sick, left truck delivery day, unheard her. breathe well, ya know. one ended horrible cough 4 5 months.

I wear N95 work, I'm sure I've gotten small doses multiple times over. There's much protect yourself, short locking home, that's feasible me. Great actually. fine. Side effects pretty random. Lack side effects mean vaccine work. concerned deaths could avoided, FDA responsible much bigger mess allowing first doses spread many citizens. 

And US going use AZ supply, release desperate countries now! estimated 8M - 30M AZ doses stockpile. many lives /will lost delaying this?! mean sure, however comment replied said ‚ÄúANYONE (Government, business....)‚Äù

So saying now? seems like aren‚Äôt keeping story straight. time need alone didnt problem far covid started. Can't/ dont want pla? say ""sorry cant"" thats it. making excuses love restrictions thats it. Again.......there absolutism comes introversion........smh. drug payload delivery system behind called Solid Lipid Nanotechnology, mRNA vaccines applicant rather technology itself. think they'll reach status vaccines, antibiotics genome sequencing. They'll definitely help us improve efficiency drugs improve cancer outcomes, they're clearly wonderful vaccines they're limited payload. I'd actually argue lot heavy lifting vaccines come $1,000 genome era. year failed corona response finally seems come senses. really like guy

I get smart, feels like biggest fear mongerer Agreed think too. Vaccines work significantly reduce transmission‚Äîpolicy centered around that. Being. cautious till 2022 work like said people done need move back normal biggest reason would country traveling may still lot restrictions make trip fun. I'm sure Costa Rica many countries still attractions closed limits masks/social distancing mandated. 

A friend mine thinking going cruse realized, even safe, cruse ship outbreak may lock everything fun.

So would say safe travel consider types activities want enjoyable restrictions. Nothing do, properly fucked now.



Just kidding, try relax good.  Probably like thousandth person say this, introvert, living hell, least two weeks. luckily nothing damaged anything, may downgrade masks mandatory recommended outdoors public spaces, long keep six feet distance. That‚Äôs see happening. reason scientists leaders. Life wait studies. problems masks point people wearing dishonest vaccination person wears one room almost everyone else doesn't. almost entirely social problem. Dude start small business say goodbye office drama Yea must mistake Great! UK well, delayed dose method might paying Link articles? Love updates, can't wait hit 69.420%. OP think posted expecting Ron DeSantis hate-brigade. right? disease spread pre-symptomatic, would expect severe strain contagious. true AIDS (to larger degree since basically spread pre-symptomatic there).

It's bizarre exact thing happened 1919. make wait 2030 let them. good thing see 75% age 65+ received first dose still increasing day... less risk population (&lt;65) exhibits similar behavior could get decent place 65-75% population vaccinated Wal-Mart day noticed three things:

1)Despite high compliance pandemic like 50% shoppers masking

2)Normal check-outs open again

3)A bunch entrances closed crowd control back open nobody monitoring 


People done pandemic ending social standpoint lot country swelling vaccination rate Internet discover way back? üòÖ Per capita raw case numbers completely relevant discussion. exactly yesterday, liberating see mates again. Canadian Toronto living London, UK vaccinated feel you... Come over! long scared AZ vaccine like others sub reddit üòÖ dont know comment downvoted. Final Four Bruin....

ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ He's always hair, part act gives fuck pretty clear likely originate UK, original strain likely originated Wuhan. argument huge coincidence would happen country best sequencing. Prevalence exceeded 50% B.1.1.7 ""wave"" began London/Kent area months anywhere else. Pre COVID would call least 1-2 times month. quarantine happened went home haven‚Äôt called off. don‚Äôt miss work ‚Äúpersonal days‚Äù anymore feel focused home. Life still ups downs home feels easier manage work now. mean like schools (private schools included) mandating vaccines order attend? certain professions requiring flu shots least? anyone working hospital form required produce negative TB test? possible ive it. friend march spent weekend house 2 days got sick....i got sick 6 days after. Got tested lab error (not enough medium specimen tube) redo it. time got tested 10 days post symptoms came back negative...so definitely possible way really know. would make sense though, feel like got hit train. Hopefully tmrw passes. Would wise fully vaccinated person travel internationally? considering trip Costa Rica since COVID I‚Äôm fully vaccinated I‚Äôm interested following through, person basically locked last year, want make sure I‚Äôm moving fast. reason fly internationally vaccinated? may show CDC paper vaccine card. Digital vaccine passports may become popular areas, unlikely way prove vaccinated. Many elderly smartphones (40% age 65 think?) many retirees love travel. way! Yeah, system poorly designed easy misuse, nonetheless, happened happened less POC able get shots system abused people program meant serve. I‚Äôm also Bay saw texts stories, people Marin Peninsula scooping appointments. LA area suburban, mainly white folks scooping program shots there.

I‚Äôm ‚Äúprojecting anti white hate,‚Äù I‚Äôm noting happened. POC continue get crushed pandemic, predominantly white WFH people continue fine, acknowledging reasons keeps happening way. surveys showing vaccine hesitancy dropping amongst demographic groups, except republicans unfortunately Yes, there's quite difference government-issued piece paper business-issued electronic record. second jab Thursday, I'm 34 mild medical condition think really justifies vulnerable, argue early jab? 

We probably administering many first doses soon, think we'll opening strong position 50s least got single dose.

Got pissed mates cold park like teenagers last night meet outside even felt liberating, really looking forward easing restrictions! Happy? talk scumbag. Im huge introvert worst year entire life never miserable, considering past bullying, really shit year.

I want life go norma (actual) introverts extroverts happy homebodies trying give introverts bad name fuck off.

If like people cut life. fyou like plans say say want time alone. try impose miserable sad excuse life everyone audacity label lunacy introversion. That‚Äôs really clear. first became dominant UK. Exactly this. outside UK know, reporting lag weekends resulting low Sunday figure, two public holidays sandwiching weekend would expect see higher blip Tuesday Wednesday straightens catches up

On hand, stay low spite this, adds proof vaccines work prevent infection, hospitalisation death. USA catches us terms population % inoculated must taking great deal positive what's happening here.

Just ignore neighbours, French terrible time since EU ballsed vaccine rollout Yeah mean voting rights individuals infringed upon totally private businesses asking show going spread disease could kill clients. get everyone vaccinated summer finally away masks all. want last forever? Sure sounds like Told boss, checkins, besides pandemic, time life working home Yeah point feel like people bought much doom gloom want stay inside forever. right lockdowns need end vaccines here. life going back normal hope everyone else too. Can‚Äôt wait grab drink see music live later month. Can‚Äôt wait ditch masks either lol

Some people realllllyyy like lockdowns staying inside like hermit can't know that, spread pattern strongly suggests it. UK first got tremendous rise cases reported 90%+ prevalence London area. afterwards country report prevalence rising. undeveloped country large case wave (regardless testing quantity) time, candidate countries international travel London (to knowledge).

I believe consensus belief highly-developed strains came single infection cured single long-term host. observed individuals (case studies), someone remaining infected months genetic makeup virus shifting dramatically time.

Regardless, need stop calling strain call B.1.1.7, (using shitty nomenclature) V1. dont understand either. would love live Israel rn. can't take away something ü§∑ü§∑  Keep mind introverts certain age live alone. example stuck small apartment girlfriend. would gladly go back awkwardly attending sort social gathering week exchange time truly alone days. got first dose moderna. tried hardest get good nights sleep last night slept almost zero. response yet vaccine even sore arm. i‚Äôm stressing lack sleep prevented strong immune response. anything do? hand, there‚Äôs people UAE paying 50000 bucks luxury covid vaccine packages üëÜüëÜ one several. Data Israel UK echoes sentiment.

Then there's basics like vaccines well known reduce case severity. Reducing severity reduces symptoms length illness would obviously effect transmission rates.

But reality data appease braindead ignorant fools like It‚Äôs mostly likely UK well since that‚Äôs first place became dominant. Possibly feds, possibly use vaccination card. needed though, think country cares vaccinated point. Though believe change. I'm Austin. bit work get appointment nearby. totally possible effort though. want drive hours easy get one.

Anecdotally say lot young people know interested this, happy go get vaccinated simply walk get nearby. People know really want vaccine got already.  Can't suffer mood declines mood bad could already! Dems aren‚Äôt mandating vaccinations kind wish would. 

All Reputable sources counterpoint post link reputable source stop misinformation. US owner could lose business incur fines someone gets covid premises. passports liability protection businesses. - travel internationally lot want know every one plane either vaccinated neg test.  true! Thank helping describe feeling  Yep. super proactive arranging socially distanced outdoor hangouts walks beginning pandemic, miss around certain people want come name safety, can't say I've particularly isolated lacking human interactions. I've actually made bunch new friends since started. looks good points towards sterilizing immunity, one study make scientific consensus yet. Shocking. People liked isolate distance fared better time called isolation distance. woulda thunk? :) Dont get fooled, comments loving lockdowns actual introverts.

An introvert means like smaller groups, tendency shy need time alone. love sad excuse existence covid restricted life.

Introverts suffering too. coming someone hasn‚Äôt complained masks real life once, believes masks work.

He‚Äôs likely gonna blame Texas Mississippi reopening soon tell people ‚Äújust another 100 days‚Äù. 

That deadline obviously nothing talk see buy time people let guard down. lifetime charitable works! children‚Äôs literacy program legendary, among many charitable donations. million dollar donation helped fund research Moderna vaccine, son got yesterday, I‚Äôm pretty thankful her! tested positive stay house play video games ten days. Damn. realizing everyone know vaccinated I'll go back making regular excuses hanging soon. Same! Agreed, unfortunately. sad part cases rising too. Yep weeks ago, 300-350 per day. 450-500+ every day. gets full fda approval (which year), required many businesses, I‚Äôm sure. 

It also may help alleviate concerns people hesitant. Dark Money funded disinformation Stop posting reddit call crisis hotline. Seriously, wish best you, admittedly poor mental state sounding rational. set remind Orsty's response comment one month see Texas doing. Looking like dead on, man. Well done. That's good point, covid deaths age group linked co-morbidities? cases seem happening otherwise healthy people (in Europe, I'm sure data available UK reports). yeah, something specific spike protein triggers harmful immune response, people theorized, would stand reason covid could cause people too. Honestly best people get vaccinated point anyone hasn‚Äôt covid already. 80% friends Covid getting (in next week) gotten first shot (within past week).  I‚Äôm super glad really don‚Äôt think slowed anything down.  Yet it‚Äôs funny talk people project heard immunity talk ‚Äúsome‚Äù overlap vaccinated natural immunity previous infections want make calculations.  personally think it‚Äôs ton.  got vaccine. WFH teammates ill. Washed hands. usual. Yeah fucking right. Also feel like never really got first wave. war Covid, next war anti vaxxers Canada Mexico easily first benefit surplus bet awful lot antivaxxer keyboard warriors proudly hate vaccines internet, chips *their* lives line quietly go get shots nobody's looking.   really isn't. free vaccine literally anyone micro percentage population get 15th here, even can't get want go test Negative particular disease pandemic. fucking maniac think ableist, like blowing mind stupid concept is. ""Lactating people""...? 

Breastfeeding mums maybe? Kick ass!! Love Michigan. first wave end? Unfortunately two 'levels': one capacity level testing proof vaccination, another capacity level either show negative test vaccine record. second level proof vaccine allowed zero restrictions (beyond obvious things like fire codes). Btw reporting comment unnecessary insult. can't partake discussion without resorting name calling argument obviously can't valid. Guess lot restrictions US smoking...

I think making point intending make. 

Are even states left smoke inside restaurant? Hi! remind kicked in, month comment. 

How things? Looking really really good stand. go jail saying free speech. Like worrying car crash every time leave something.

I think difference though one awareness behavior. may ""worry car crash EVERY time get behind wheel"".. still make effort drive safely, lookout shitty drivers ""safe behaviors"". types safeguards things everyone (to collectively make roads safer). live downtown area,. full Cars, Pedestrians, Bikes, Busses, etc. I'm going drive far differently I'm open country road there's nothing around 60 miles. 

Public Health social behavior roughly same. keep awareness around make decisions (subjectively) based current conditions around you. going public event front-entrance waiting-room already 40 people stuffed it,.. getting ticket-number waiting outside might smarter decision. matter context subjective-analysis. many CVST events Pfizer / BioNTech would considered cause concern?

The US delivered amazing number doses - released number CVST events far? Would good comparison see less per dose UK.  Yeah....that's pretty good reason tell fuck off. I'm jackass. privilege showing. Telling people physically unable get vaccine unable attend events actual discrimination purely ableist. go on. right here. one reasons respect him. Lies Well freedom speech talk happy puppies flowers. Either allow lose slippery slope. Good see republicans still semblance brain. course, international condemnation people like denied PA managed health affairs 20 years, collects tax revenue massive foreign aid that, vaccination plan. Israel done far better job vaccinating ethnic minority populations - especially Arab Israelis - country done. Never say never, did. thought bartending recession proof. Who's going stop drinking would say. Boy wrong. Well, 52% vaccinated... states require (in theory) also personal objections get exemption it, practice mandatory since ""I dont like vaccines"" unironically good reason get exemption states Exact same. assuming Mid May. got appointment April 29th. found one next tuesday. feel real, I've literally dreams able make vaccine appointment waking realizing real. Today woke looked appointment email glad see actually real.  He's killing voters. nuts. People lie abandon. think EVERYONE needs vaccine passport. Two classes citizens. Yes, vaccinated need protected people would lie face claim vaccine, didn't. Johnson Johnson vaccine 100% protective. could still get somewhat sick. People allergic polyethylene glycol Moderna Pfizer vaccines would need Johnson Johnson vaccine. Yeah this. cost far high. going miserable jackass matter what, got lol. 

It's ableism get vaccine, fucking mind. extremely, extremely miniscule part population able get vaccine whatever medical reason, probably immunocompromised concert/ major event anyway. adults eligible 15th literally reason get one.

It would one thing **had** proof vaccine, allowing people show Negative Test get fair compromise. Could possibly negative literally day yet somehow positive event? Sure, chances miniscule everyone else either vaccinated tested Negative. chance anything going wrong fucking remote literally even worth energy think about. making sure syringes used twice

You might want keep rule... Especially aids heavy areas. reminds great scene West Wing ‚Äúrich billionaire type‚Äù offering CJ job manage project wants he‚Äôll fund, doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs best way charitable money.

And says highways Africa (cause something like ‚Äú9 10 projects‚Äù Africa fail don‚Äôt proper highway system) Wait, worse US? Oh shit! fuck Possible?üò≤ really ‚Äúlots terrifying side effects.‚Äù source claim? 2800 yesterday! nonstop busy! Yay! Medical Doctors post grad lot higher risk line work I‚Äôm even sure NEEDS shoulder, that‚Äôs it‚Äôs tested. could self inject thigh too. I'm lazy run numbers love seeing them. disagree Dr. Fauci. I'll still listen recommendations keep us safe though lol, yeah forgot specify one! hear you, I‚Äôm getting vaccinated CONTINUE wearing masks indefinitely. Sure! they‚Äôre private businesses. exclude want! Nope nope nope - hate Debbie Downer here, 3.975m doses *reported*. still one day high reporting, 3.975m doses *administered*. easy google search person suggested. need look least couple different websites get basics. took liberty linking might understand exactly works interested sort thing! interested there's TL;DR bottom.

[As March Israel vaccinated half population two shots, 60% single dose. That's good article goes quite different aspects vaccination efforts challenges country faced. includes certain groups within Israel abiding public health precautions (no large gatherings, masks, social distancing etc) well vaccine hesitancy. There's factors play weather mild Israel winter apply less US heading warmer months.

[This shows live data estimates vaccination efforts globally corrects based official reported numbers daily.

There's things remember going this:

1. [First doses highly protecting someone.
2. [Real world former point shown UK.
3. [It take weeks dose Look chart second link posted set cases ""Doses vs Cases"". see two three weeks March 15th hit 50% fully inoculated number people still first dose, cases began decline significantly. decline likely due people getting first shot administered.

Hope helps! danger

Newsom really danger No, means they‚Äôre moving endgame slowly would want to. That‚Äôs all. lockdowns place prevent considered reasonable? talking close everything put curfews people months without end type lockdowns. one vaccine shot 80% reduction chance become infected. second dose gets 90% longer term immunity. first thought too. Unfortunately, is. wife getting vaccinated next week, hopefully avoid worst mess. covid right now. roommate gave me, since recovered okay hang common space? I've gotten first dose waiting get 2nd. sure vaccinated case actually means. There's much info/disinfo difficult understand whats what. kept checking store pharmacies last days since 29th one opening popped suddenly one Marc's 40 minutes away. Worth much, I'm already scheduled end month dose #2 Let us know goes! Ok, move home then. come back month whatever. kinda point vaccineS dont understand cant ban international travel year two? Let one country covid gone.

To doesnt make sense let people fly South Africa, UK, Brazil covid strain bring USA wreak havoc. NPR since edited title since posted. title now:

**Fauci Expects Surge Vaccinations Keep 4th Coronavirus Wave Bay** don‚Äôt think employees company included law, it‚Äôs certainly something I‚Äôd look try pull shit us. is, wife getting vaccinated next week, we‚Äôre hoping avoid issue altogether soon. still wear high quality mask distance even vaccinated. US options bought enough cover entire populations market rate instead rock bottom clearance bin haggled prices. Laughs Floridian. still contagious sometimes harmful? wondering managed keep safe before. hope so, second shot laid flu symptoms 2 days, sweats, fever, chills. Worth it, lasts 6 months, reaction get less severe i'll dread taking boosters. shitty getting every year, damn 80 hours second dose arms still sore feel like 85% switch vaccines? probably dumb question. got first AZ Monday I'm highly regretting news coming I'm Female 25. flu much less contagious covid. to! also \[literally\] go insane isolated long even 'social distanced'.  read somewhere case Norway, 78% vaccine recipients women (healthcare workers teachers). People kept saying overly optimistic saying gonna get shot June 1. Start March, revised May 1. month, got shot yesterday. Nothing ever made anxiety worse covid lockdowns. uncertainty whether locked house tomorrow whether br able see doctor different country one point risk lose everything can't fit one car, would let back across border ... things worse learning incurable potentially disabling disease years ago.

The world took one giant dump lot people mental health issues, suddenly, covid thing mattered lockdowners give shit ""collateral damage"". sat watching trains passing by, contemplating jumping next one. Nah sounds completely line me. supplier made good promises exceeded expectations shouldn‚Äôt pay bailed us. "" contrast, 9 months, convalescent sera mean sixfold reduction neutralizing titers, 40% samples lacked activity B.1.351.""

Neutralizing antibody everything important well correlate protection. say immune escape months, even use words.  Pfizer/BioNTech I‚Äôm pretty sure produced EU US, look global delivery numbers, 120M doses Pfizer delivered US I‚Äôm mistaken. anecdotal I‚Äôve handful students get confirmed covid 2 less 20 see pediatric pulmonologists. know keep saying doesn‚Äôt effect kids watched two healthy students suddenly walk around like 70 year old smokers. weren‚Äôt hospitalized oxygen home weeks.

Assuming variant 60% transmissible original, 8 10,000 still small number.  You‚Äôre willfully missing point accomplish something isn‚Äôt quite clear yet regardless I‚Äôm done know corona burned bunker people Moderna produced Switzerland point completely correct. Pfizer/BioNTech could set production different non-EU country big pfarma presence. Maybe cheap ass politicians take six months order something. cases go down, due drop testing, time cases go up, new wave definitely nothing number tests performed, got it. spread highly skewed, infect dozens once, people infect one. See have, also received boatloads government funding Germany EU. think would crazy demand use ridiculous producing power deliver EU's doses record speed back exporting. Or, export certain percent that's produced, leaving ~85% strictly EU only. IDK yet, still waiting conclusive data US UK assholes mean EU needs fall level. live Asia got BioNTech. I'm grateful. constant pestered extrovert looking attention [here's michigan's one states highest rates states even hitting half testing goals, many states could early stages surging idea. 4th? think guys rode 1st wave way through....

Seriously though, I'm glad finally getting things control. enough loss already. Congrats. mine Thursday, aside sore arm last 2 days. feeling great! Fair enough case Pfizer provided exactly promised Q1 exporting time. It‚Äôs AZ failing us, them.  Thanks insight! Got Moderna I'm California. churches embrace science? past month I‚Äôve enjoying seeing friends, something hadn‚Äôt done year. feels surreal around people without mask, get used it. fully vaccinated October (part Pfizer trial Pfizer confirmed get placebo). Two weeks go back blood draw check antibody levels blood. times, study last next two years. pfizer clearly stated side-effect. people know it, information.

/u/flyingdutchman1337 EU already exported vast swaths countries could inoculate vulnerable. think it'd kind protected worlds vulnerable move vaccinate entire EU population. checked hour person replying to, checking morning still get appts cities thru cvs. side effects:

This quite popular argument reddit, really make sense. I'm gonna ignore steal part (because lol) I'm gonna focus brag one.

Companies *exist*. like production EU *are*. EU is, along US maybe India, environment enough facilities, know how, money, legal logistical prowess function global supply hub. one key global pharma hotspots well pandemic already multiple facilities needed set current needs. Even export ban companies would likely still used EU production hub simply waited export ban lifted, happening US. love find excuses going anymore  Ohio, get first shot automatically schedule second 3 4 weeks later. happens everywhere else? I've read number comments people trying schedule 2nd shot. Sometimes, predict things, wish things right. Sound amazing remenber many indians exist lmao.

Gonna take while. Something popular amongst extroverts beginning pandemic virtual hangouts Zoom whatnot. 

I like... fuck would want that? Congrats, Trump said could done April üëç thought still first wave... something never thought tend agree. Regardless good intentions, idea vaccine passports dystopian feel spark fear conspiratorial thoughts less educated people. else would made base international exports? There's nowhere else. mention EU even highest producing region, produced similar amounts US, companies looking place base global exports would can't. asshole (1) Brexit (2) socialized medicine? want true analysis yes answer. Don‚Äôt threaten good time. 1/2.5million risk death... mean... makes sense. introverted mean COVID COVID measures negatively affect us introverted better prepares us it. true another reality people going randomly get tested. People get tested they're sick despite public health folks want people do. Getting tested exactly pleasant Let Palestinians trade travel. Till Palestinians obviously pool bonded labour Israel exploit factories.
I wonder idea came from? definitive terms, yeah, way I've seen term used recent times comes implication means news bullshit, always case.

In unrelated example Brexit - people indeed scaremongering talking financial hits UK would take - people called scaremongering (which was), therefore said nothing worry about, really UK suffering it.

It's bit ethical conundrum comes covid variants. It‚Äôs expert oversimplifying things. Happens time. 

At airport security, TSA says machines won‚Äôt harm film certain ISO. Obviously false, go security many times see radiation effects matter ISO. picked number people can‚Äôt see difference. 

CDC says six feet apart. Also simplification. better, singing 8 feet worse quiet talking 5 feet. waiting confirmation couple family members still received theirs. Apparently grandma sister gotten yet, they‚Äôve heavy hesitancy get various reasons, conspiracies mainly don‚Äôt think point. could get Pfizer dose literally today tomorrow they‚Äôre taking offer get appointment, even grandpa got Moderna dose yesterday grandma refuses. üôÑ

My sister apparently covid months ago, read anti-bodies last 6 months post-recovery right? don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs getting vaccine either.

So looks like I‚Äôve narrowed down; grandma, sister husband sister/husband they‚Äôre two months post-recovery covid I‚Äôm guessing antibodies involved them. 

Unfortunately it‚Äôs 100% family that‚Äôs board,I‚Äôm sure even go them? guess seeing post-full vaccination/protection isn‚Äôt bad I‚Äôm still wearing masks lol. weeks ago, posted article advocating that, commenters disagreed me. even got removed, despite reliable source, perhaps that's editorial-style article. 12 hours post johnson johnson vaccine, felt like absolute crap bed. Finally able bring fever sleep. 24 hours later back normal temperature feel good. We're 17% fully vaccinated now. grossly underestimating. found coronavirus Wuhan lab experiments made transmissible, became identical SARS-CoV-2, infected worker. Likewise, nobody found coronavirus wild mutated become similar SARS-CoV-2 passed animals, infected humans. **Both ideas largely evidence-free point. possible.** states even hitting half testing goals. even quarter testing goals.

Looking states test more, say Michigan I'm from.. we're exploding cases, county stone's throw away literally breaking record, highest vaccination rates state.

Michigan believe sixth seventh highest testing rate country. worry we're first spot surge. Michigan slightly national vaccination rate, still restaurant capacity limits, mask mandate, restrictions gatherings. 

[our case graph looking pretty again, we're testing like 40 states. Significantly more. many cases, many times testing. No. dumb. seeing thing Norway well - even though confirmed cases peaking hospitalizations near record highs, deaths continue low. hospitalization survival rate seems improved significantly younger people getting hospitalized, deaths elderly care centers (which account COVID-19 deaths Norway) virtually stopped thanks vaccines. complicated long good article simple answers, European Commission failed buy protective gear ventilators needed countries Europe time failed buy vaccine time too. 

They spent large amounts time giving Pfizer/biontech hard time liability pretty much allowing Astrazeneca exempt disagreements buying mRNA vaccines become pretty much cornerstone world

*Germany, however, wanted throw money problem. Specifically, wanted bet even bigger homegrown mRNA vaccines ‚Äî especially given BioNTech well Phase 3 trials. mid-September, Berlin announced giving ‚Ç¨375 million BioNTech ‚Ç¨252 million CureVac.*

*Other capitals quick push back. invest expensive, unproven technologies need transported super low temperatures? countries, notably Bulgaria, thought portfolio broad. Poland spoke mRNA vaccines represent half stock.*

In end, EU pretty much put bets AstraZeneca , even though extended contracts massive amounts Pfizer/Biontech (pretty much Germany threatened leave whole deal). prepared transport vaccine countries like Bulgaria even buy (which later gifted Germany, others fucked up). 

*The Hague bet* [*so *on Oxford/AstraZeneca jab first approved hadn‚Äôt finished preparing transport mRNA vaccines, need kept temperatures far freezing. Cash-strapped Sofia eschewed big orders mRNA vaccines; made a*[ *show *a thousand Moderna shots January 14 amid criticism.*¬†

Anyway long story short, EU screwed whole deal signed late, many orders made much earlier EU back line. EU power like US stop vaccine leaving shores much, urgency really needed EU totally lacking. 

&amp;#x200B;

And even though EU finally built capacity expand vaccine production, still end line 1st world countries. get first Monday TL;DR believe conspiracy woo. Sure. even 25% population children, get infected cannot infect 75% majority fully vaccinated. countries significant uptake vaccine? two dose vaccine, takes 3 weeks second dose fully vaccinated. country situation. Chile closer one, still far away mass vaccination facing cases spike still controlled deaths numbers. 

Here Brazil, vaccinating whole city vaccine (called Serrana), Brazilian variant predominant city. final stage mass vaccination, pretty soon we'll new variant stands vaccine real life. Maybe. ever lay someone time future, it'd probably pool people refused get covid shot. pace supposed increase April further? Looking Danish plans vaccination, end May intends vaccinate people except kids &lt;16 ages 25-39. first shot time, still, ain't looking bad - paper. apparently 80% safe covid 1 shot. Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine hasn‚Äôt around long. information new guidance - COVID vaccines highly effective preventing illness, severe illness, hospitalization transmission. Vaccinated persons around vaccinated persons without mask, travel good go, etc. still people personal life still saying feel safe even vaccine others saying vaccine stop getting COVID spreading variants! I've trying give facts articles read (as opposed sensationalized headlines), getting through. frustrating many still ounce gratitude medical miracle. SMH. Yes indeed! CDC articulated November planning vaccine distribution phases. write meeting notes vaccinate essential workers multiplier effect, also taking risks keep society functioning. 

They also articulated 15 reasons vaccinate groups ended 3 phase program proposed; eventually complicated went primarily age based program know today. 

Their discussion birthday 2 weeks, I'd love vaccinated (or least 1 dose).. opened vaccinations 30 past week. waited days knew they'd slammed. I've trying get appointment last couple days luck NYS website. still super slammed get constant errors. Man, sending good vibes news, floor made floor. Outside Chicago, worry rules like that. finally going taken seriously now? covid last April, still occasionally get symptoms. can‚Äôt get help get time work though GPs don‚Äôt believe me. I‚Äôve never health problems whole life, see people chronic health issues deal with. medical gaslighting terrible. greatly increased distrust lack faith doctors.  vaccine available Australia? work procuring another option younger population many young people want take given emerging data. exactly! trying prevent happening . hospitals getting crowded resulting public health issues...and deaths. 

thats understanding Sorry, I'm gonna roll dice 1 50K headshot save abstract grandma. mean one watch people die order tell truth? Extremely unlikely far know. read anything original strain variants significantly transmissible via surfaces. Osterholm: ‚ÄúDid somebody say doom gloom?‚Äù let US release biomed records now. get feeling us won‚Äôt send vaccines like 65-70% vaccinated Problem ""tests"" suggested poor efficacy variants done lab samples individuals, population.

A moderately effective vaccine whole population still take virus since (1) increase exposed viral load threshold get infected, (2) decrease viral load end infected, reducing ability spread virus. Shut already joking? point Fauci saying whatever comes head somebody sticks mic face. Looking India's current cases deaths, they're growing much faster initial wave, 7-day death average went 319 410 two days. suspect case fatality rate growing coming days testing requirements tighten deaths start coming rapidly growing number active cases. guess ed-1t referring US since handed 1 billion development. decline positivity rate comes alongside drastic drop testing happened Texas freeze. Perhaps, depending age 60% protected S. African variant. Yeah that's seems like. company small Google either, like 100-150 employees.

I remember pissed pandemic first started bosses kept excuses people ""essential"" come office. Stop posting fake news man. ineffective, serious study, trough respected institute Brazil Chinese vaccine got 50% infection protection, 78% mild infections higher, statistics significance. Also 100% moderate/severe infection, although one without statistics significance. 

It's safe effective vaccine, probably good Pfizer still good. Doubt it. 20% still realistic April. Mid May, might 30%, things go well. shown statistics. literally done nothing ""subtly"" hint intelligence sense doctors researchers. walking example Dunning-Kreuger; caught idea intelligence even realize far depth I'll ask, actual sources back statements?

You calling stupid? would great example lack self awareness did. repeatedly asked something I've already given you. freaquent tactic used redditors. stats comparisons viruses speak use data PRESENT. believe enough prove point curfews lockdowns necessary. Masks? Fine, vaccines? Fine, social distancing? Fine. Lockdowns curfews? last resort. first thing jump to. Medical projections skewed show infections never happend country. States U.S. mask mandates infections states without mask mandates. Doctors spoken lockdowns curfews. infection deaths falling line absolute panic media pushing. many inconsistencies put absolute faith mainstreams discussion COVID. look outwards aware place stats combined totaled properly different countries since reporting methods data vary heavily. I'm sure exists idea much would cost access get since sites listing reported cases deaths. know US data states responsible reporting stuff, need aggregate historical data 2020 get clear picture. There's incomplete total found:

Damn. Well someone eventually release info. Seems useful know. know worldometer primary source really basic COVID last thing well. highly likely current covid numbers severely underrepoted based excess deaths many hardest hit areas. Much data asking really available years researchers actually compile dig data Covid finally over.

Yes considered possibility. Ultimately operate data available me. data use found worldometer googling past viruses. entire argument relies taking infection death rates previous pandemics comparing Covid. TRUELY undebatable data come years now. it.

Yes several factors remain unaddressed pointed out. factors actually help point lockdowns curfews. dont think certain nuances really change equation much. Like yes 1918 health standards, terrible. obviously lead infections. Nutrition weaker. Medical advances joke. things could contribute spanish flu awful was. also explains COVID bad media says is. great things would prefer relied instead of, know, destroying peoples lively hoods lockdowns curfews lead lay offs? always little guys getting screwed man I'm sick it!!! I'm sick higher wage people unaffected kind stuff. Pisses off. 38% eligible population vaccinated, 30% total. agree saying we‚Äôre little closer might think said that, knows. definitely people risky sh-t also making big deal taking covid seriously. really fascinated scenarios.  Awesome, stonks go now? \*Redditor makes valid point comments comment\*  
""Look douche!""  
Meanwhile addressing obvious inconsistency belief people vaccines 100% effective even consider 100% proven safe. thank EU exporting 71.000.000 doses 3 months. US also gets millions doses EU, including doses JJ. Yeah boi, got 1st jab 4/1, still feelin' it! got first shot morning; can't wait long nightmare Quasicorrecto Yeah middle school wearing stone-washed jeans zippers ankles. backlog. recently everyone told get vaccinated continue wear mask social distance. makes absolute ton sense. would bowing political pressure, would not?

I'm type always afraid vaccines always feared bad reaction. However one knew get fear. husband got first shot last week scheduled second one 22nd. shot kicked ass (body aches, fever, headache, etc) I'm glad got it. virus killed many people even though I'd probably okay get since I'm young rarely get sick, still want contract spread others may able fight easily. Funny Democrat white house, press hunky glory, nice nice. TLDR: Europe thought clever haggling bargain-binning vaccine makers midst pandemic. now, reaping sow still agree worst one??? vaccine need dozen updates every two weeks Fortunately, vaccines gone highest risk people, *by far* likely get seriously ill end hospital. Raw ‚Äúcases!‚Äù numbers don‚Äôt mean before. Tide turning. articles crazy ones now.

Extroverts good whole lives, nice introverts actually way life suits once. Fear missing bio-weapon lab (in Wuhan), however labs research viruses - corona viruses them.

She's 75 years old, eligible since beginning. arm pain went away 2-3 days. Hang there, soldier! current boss taken interesting approach. lead engineer older guy work environment hard time older staff adjusting well wfh. problem projects I've run. started new project guy like zoom meetings managing remote. feels unable control design. freaking behind timeline requests help put me, senior engineer, junior engineer help him. 2 months ago. 

It started giving short rundown tasks do. started looking things request finding problems potential solutions. Offer implement said solutions. Denied want designing anything. wants documenting creating drawings. Without looking shoulder trust I'll right. Ok, whatever. create drawings schedule meeting review sending vendors. refuses meeting. Call him. Get call maybe 10 minutes mostly gotta stressed overworked is. refuses give new guy actual significant work lighten load. find guy weekly meetings engineering leads guide decisions allowing underlings attend, even telling us discussed. time disseminate information. work asking additional tasking, feel comfortable giving out, refuses respond contact attempts. heard peep lead in... It'll month next week. 

So I'm sitting payroll wondering next apparent time wondering point consider calling boss. Reluctant office politics absurd. mention I've become de facto checker new guys work lead apparently it. noticed blatant problems work (typical new guy stuff) lead rubber stamping through, time review anything. 

Damnit I've lead 3 years never seen anything like this. Incredibly stressful.

No, need see freaking doctor. Unlikely lol. Extroverts already trying shoehorn everybody else back preferred lifestyle. Celebrities getting vaccinated helps convince hesitant. won‚Äôt jobs. similar issues America masks things. didnt say 1,8 million got vaccine.

I thought correct stay numbers. thought conservatives wanted let businesses want without government interfering. You‚Äôre supposed disagree that. Ugh... country we've roadmaps, conditional restrictions, regional plans, etc etc. went shit closed everything indefinitely continuous extensions. People trust roadmaps more. I'm waiting post-Pandemic surge WFH-as-perk jobs I'll qualify done it. Yes numbers simplified said. different country can‚Äôt make general claim anyway. Australia 0 young women died covid use vaccine could kill several. would make sense give risk group different vaccine. isn‚Äôt AZ vs. vaccine AZ vs. vaccine.  ridiculously hyperbolic. government hiding anything, involved release information. cancers caused viruses.

Literally took second reading realize wasn‚Äôt asking. ;-) January super early. Many places hadn‚Äôt even gotten vaccine yet still phase vaccinating actual hospital workers.  reason saying actually worried new varients. yes, opinions hhave backed science right get something like flu vaccine, actually getting 4 different vaccines one. vaccines designed different strains flu. Since flu, cold, mutate quickly, there's lot different ones protect from.

With MRNA vaccines, find common feature cold flu vaccines, code MRNA protect feature prevent multiple flu cold vaccines.

This COVID vaccine effective. There's spike protein COVID virus uses attach cells simply change much mutations.

Is possible find something cold flu viruses? idea, could wrong, say stuff I've heard past year! I‚Äôd put money fact discussing exact thing past weeks behind closed doors. 

That's also hurry take vaccines.

The incentives huge release vaccines general risk lower virus people. gladly take long term testing. don‚Äôt understand. He‚Äôs pro-covid. I‚Äôm not. risk factors death hospitalization different it‚Äôs hundreds times worse elderly get it, opinion done, there‚Äôs 0 excuse restrictions continue.

Like roller coaster. Seriously. CDC added vaccination demographic trends yesterday: provides historical daily data age group, see percentage age group received least one dose fully vaccinated. (Excluding TX due lack data, may exactly match national data)

Percentage people age group received least one dose

|Age Group|2021-03-27|2021-04-03|
|:-|:-|:-|
|75+ yrs|72.9%|75.4%|
|65-74 yrs|71.6%|75.2%|

|30-39 yrs|22.0%|26.4%|
|18-29 yrs|14.3%|17.7%|

The rate new vaccinations slowing age 65+, still going 50.

For example, 9.2% unvaccinated age 75+ reported received vaccine past week, compared 10.9% week prior. 17% mid-March.

Percentage unvaccinated people age group receiving first dose past week

I'd rather watch movie home theater, I'd rather friends drinks go bar, I'd rather take-out eat out, etc. enjoy getting house stuff; ""going out"" part never factored appeal, always prerequisite things enjoy.

To clear, I'm trying shitty ""enlightened introvert"" thing reddit lot. 100% get appeal things mentioned empathize people struggling adjusting changes, entirely reasonable valid miss restaurants coffee shops whatnot; person happens mesh well changes.

I also want sound like I'm grateful Covid I'm certainly not; I'd gladly give ability chill home meant nobody died Covid last year. societal changes Covid necessitated positive change personally.

if went jeans rain jacket would miserable, actually dressed cold weather uncomfortable. maybe outdoor dining mask gloves like friends presumably face hands uncomfortable, terms social possible comfortable outside. Wow groundbreaking. Forcing people stay inside makes people like staying inside happy?!! What‚Äôs next people like going unhappy. agree, there‚Äôs lot evidence outdoor masks really don‚Äôt make difference unless crowd, like there‚Äôs evidence surface transmission isn‚Äôt big deal originally thought. 

I think experts plainly don‚Äôt trust public good news year Trump pandemic response, Covid parties, two Spring Breaks people flaunting rules, they‚Äôre mainly still pushing outdoor masks deep cleaning surfaces ‚Äúbetter safe sorry‚Äù measures. America annual flu shot program. even know exists india, even does, would quite rare.

Never thought I'd see day US handles corona better European country, german government's handling nonexistent Yeah stupid, especially considering many people vaccinated now. I‚Äôm hanging 20 people we‚Äôre fully vaccinated gives shit? I‚Äôm sure someone saw us together they‚Äôd shame us post online even though CDC agrees it‚Äôs fine. Possibly. think following NYCs lead this. Live events important California NYC particularly LA metro what's alternative? People unable vaccinated hide forever? Telling class people protected discrimination laws they're allowed certain spaces ok. Allowing precedent telling protected class allowed public space worth illusion short term safety. Haha ban dissent, losers! Seriously doubt that. Restrictions still place, it'll better lot states still serious kind travel kind indoor gatherings limited except florida etc. Also remember every 1 person posts Facebook chills diarrhea, 10 don‚Äôt bother posting felt ok mild cold (which I‚Äôm getting write). bet booster shots mRNA vaccines AZ others phased out. Even UK government asked CureVac develop mRNA booster. Screw Cuomo anyone didn‚Äôt outbreak first wave started stats huge leg up. burgeoning therapeutics, treatment protocols, experienced travel nurses, knowledge benefit delaying ventilation, time purchase PPE set Covid wards better. 

Once take consideration Cali real outlier tough restrictions horrible outcomes. rest seem make sense.

Then antibody test everyone vaccinated around 2 weeks completion doses. 98.6 F body temperature people at.

It also one simple answer.

Due lack trial data efficacy 65+, number countries decided restrict AZ 65s. reasonable.
Other countries, including UK, decided take (small) gamble, give age group (note also position EMA). _also_ reasonable, reason logistics Pfizer vs AZ favored giving Pfizer hospital settings.

The consequence UK administered lot AZ, elderlies. Essential workers, medical staff, would primarily got Pfizer. countries restricted AZ younger people, opposite happened, AZ given _only_ essential workers, way age group.

And appears problem arises younger people... Smarter people higher paying jobs. Smarter people trust science. think nationally, 'hospitalizations' best metric point. Yes, know increasing states, overall, think we're still quite well. Hell, state, 3000 hospitalized. today, we're barely 300. Nice steady decline since peak Jan. 8th.... Wait next week decides opposite.... Masks dont help prevent spread expect first wave either... Hope feel better. least know better ending hospital. keep reminding that.

Great! governors would come actual number many need vaccinated kill mandates, that'd even better. Good thing that's Polis doing.

B. Covid isn‚Äôt ever going away. countries starting vaccination back Half 2022. Name one proposed law one proposed executive action. current time, exactly zero Dem policies it. It‚Äôs 100% private business GOP attacks proxy non-existent Dem policy. probably worry much unless planning go fly internationally. Even wanted to, time got shit together enough implement policies cards pandemic long would meaningless. Covid? doubt it, maybe May vaccinated also provides near 100% protection severe case COVID even manage catch it?

Absolutely Vaccine risks overwhelmingly present short term may chronic problem known mechanisms make people sick years later.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm concerned P1 variant Brazil. SA variant seem contagious - look data SA itself, plus taken foothold anywhere else. UK variant contagious plenty real-world data vaccines work it.

HOWEVER, P1 variant contains multiple potentially-immune-evading mutations, contagious come, seems highest propensity re-infect individuals (implying also highest probability evade vaccines). virtually data vaccine efficacy. trials done emerged, there's real-world data Brazil vaccinated enough people yet provide anything meaningful.

We're starting see variant take hold places, e.g. BC Canada, scary. I've tried fairly optimistic past year... one keeping night. something add up... cdc saying variants 
yet variant tracking leave impression still rare;  exaggerating messaging. one saying stay locked inside (at least US) continue wearing masks distancing awhile more. It‚Äôs small step take, even much land education.

This good read: confirm. I'm extreme introvert actually sadly enjoyed pandemic. 

Going mask really helps social anxiety. 

I'm deep convention scene work, go crowded, smelly places pandemic amazing. conventions moved online, able sell stuff instead. 

I got bunch stuff done around house saved ton money go friends various expensive things. 

When super strict lockdowns going traffic nonexistent, used excuse go week long camp around state thing, staying BLM land middle nowhere since interstates almost traffic. Avoiding people like literal plague going on. wonderful. 

There door door sales people. 

No awkward family gatherings holiday (which godsend since half family republic half democrat would bloodbath year last years indication). 

All friends still connected online. Tabletop gaming went tabletop simulator. Everyone home play mmorpgs stuff day. blast. 

I'm looking forward going back normal give usual reddit karmafaming response saying felt bad others since honestly don't. I'll miss it. nice year usual social commitments. sucked you, well sucks guess. usually takes weekend fire bombed Japan largely cultural programming situational, yes. mean deaths/cases? personal experience Michigan, say you‚Äôre probably right. large group friends went Florida weeks ago, entire house quarantine bc least 3 tested positive. reiterate, didn‚Äôt go Florida don‚Äôt blame lol you‚Äôre card need protected?

Take picture put original safe wherever keep important shit China funded western vaccines? southernmost South America concern virus me. Specifically, care about:

a.) ability people medically can't vaccinate enjoy normal life someday

b.) even protected, people COVID means opportunities mutate, potentially become deadly, escape vaccine Vaccine passport forcing vaccination tho. really futur-proofing case country requiring vaccination travelers... sub weird. like people want continue acting like April 2020. fully vaccinated, anything want. Go baseball game, restuarant, bar, church, movie theater want. Generally science caution go hand  Took minute process meant that's new favorite term someone walking around mask pulled chin found within toxic work environment away time. Gave enough distance time realize that.

I felt happier away. don‚Äôt consider accurate. left pushing vaccine passports point people like Biden DeBlassio come say no, though Biden leaving open local governments implement them. It‚Äôs major focus New Normal movement. New Normals call vaccine passports, mean everywhere, like public transportation government buildings schools. private businesses. Darwinism Glad one Inteovert here. Nothing really changed last year, except less times seeing friends IRL. actually like going public mask too. uncommon reply comment wanted add point previous one? Lol I‚Äôve noticed similar shit. Sports bro here, sports bro there. can‚Äôt relate don‚Äôt care sports heh Yeah sometimes wanna fuck dinosaurs  Drawing vaccine doses actually got one favorite jobs year; get hide little corner vaccination site, put music, focus getting perfect 0.3mL (or 0.5mL) syringe morning. I'm done doses day, I'm free agent get cover vaccinators get breaks, get give shots myself. It‚Äôs nice review clinical trials understand people obsessed cancelling anything. time pre-covid couldnt something said ""no cant"" thats it. making excuses loving restrictions. still questions that. accepted science point. Thus, measures remain now, even could that, regenerated cell growth would likely affect cells body, would raise risk cancer quite lot, think mRNA way cell regeneration. knows future holds however. agree doom long. Things come back normal. eternally grateful science vaccines important step getting things reopened. Data suggests vaccines significantly lower transmission rate focus policy around that. He‚Äôs starting social media company get message next run. 

He‚Äôs definitely planning running again. introvert chronic health issues, definitely noticed mood better. pretend extroverted I'm feeling well appease others. actually go back working office next week I'm dreading it. I'm going start looking jobs wfh permanently least hybrid model

On hand, knowing people suffering dying covid, including people know, well political unrest racial tensions US, definetly dampened whole ""mood improvement"" thing. Mostly it‚Äôs nice guilted stuff you‚Äôd rather skip. It‚Äôs built excuse go mother law‚Äôs house party you‚Äôre feelin‚Äô it. like parties it‚Äôs nice blowing without offending people don‚Äôt know anyone actually enjoys unless they‚Äôre borderline psychopaths. got appointments via one sites uh, wrong. Yeah, except haven‚Äôt reached part virus stops spreading.

The virus going stop spreading. unfortunately stuck another seasonal endemic virus we're going continually fight vaccination.

The goal long time keep many people getting sick hospitalized systems get overloaded perform triage resulting death people could otherwise saved. we're point anyone risk age groups willing vaccinated vaccinated. willing workers vulnerable positions get virus spread vaccinated. we're process vaccinating rest adult population. I'm convinced allow people go sports stadiums concerts allow vaccinated people go around without masks knowing assholes without many young people would get sick we'd overload hospitals needlessly kill people. I'm willing see science I've read quite bit. seems goal posts changing based science abundance caution. 27M healthy. got Pfizer morning. headache slight body aches. Tired well. Completely normal. Since vaccine passports political move

What talking about? Vaccine passports private business thing, government thing. I‚Äôm literally cracking use article Dolly Parton, celebrities, make comment. 

Completely touch point actually funny. She‚Äôs like prototype celebrity supposed be, supposed fame fortune. RNA vaccines looking targeting HIV too. gets made approved next 3 years, truly living amazing Whoring 20s. know percentage long term risks show up. I'll take covid unknown vaccine made hyper speed would fast track beyond safety limits make sure get pandemic. risk cases near 0, capable dodging crowded places evidently sick people consider way lower chance actual infection. go bar lose friends promotions. never actually optional thing. 

How extroverts felt year introverts always feel.  pro vaccine can't see invasive measure privacy. People assume anti-vaxxer see punishment. latest evidence points vaccines indeed stop transmission well. I'm allowed eat drink classes they're labs, zoom joyous could eat drink. Also lose mind sit long lecture, freedom play phone, chase cat, fold laundry, spin circles floor liberating me. Wow great read, started new job head boss micro manager. Well where‚Äôs evidence that? Per following study:
 vaccinated severely lower viral load less likely spread infection. Early research Pfizer suggests 75-90% drop transmission expected per data Israel. 

There comes point messaging change. can‚Äôt stay locked inside forever‚Äîit adverse effects too, look economy small businesses getting decimated, mention children able socialize, lockdowns causing mental distress millions. vaccines rolling data suggesting transmission lowered need take steps get back normal. Balancing reopening infection important.  Ikr üòû can‚Äôt believe comments. consider relatively social introvert feel same, don‚Äôt want zoom one person time even annoying af. much yes. Aahhh Alabama Moderna, least dads pharmacy People important jobs. work support can't. Society recovers benefits live people start work again.

What kind banana republic ELECTS health officials? joke? course not, mean vaccinated people wearing masks going make practical difference anyway. Yeah lol misinformed. Social anxiety fear based disorder fear social awkwardness. like assume like travel extroverted introvert. travel still introverted, introvert/extrovert labels black white. 

I issues new settings meeting people. Hell many folks tell time work they're surprised introverted. point personal preference prefer engage/deal people all. 

Hence stated although I'm introvert align closer misanthrope. I'd rather home small farm tending work hobbies. 

When stated put ""social face"" meant put facade. I'm sure aware fake personas there? ""be nice"" co-workers, superiors, customers, etc don't.....then able pay bills. However working deal anymore. would hate feel miserable work , hopefully none Apparently we‚Äôre friends pull supermarket sign says ""vaccinated customers need wear masks"" think honor system going work? US UK assholes? didn‚Äôt realize better negotiations contracts makes asshole.

I learned something new today. read article really solution this. Quite opposite fact.

The problem medical (and census) forms people Arab/Middle Eastern origin identifier. They're either putting white/ (and article mention it, assume lot choosing black well). skews data, there's differences referred MENA (Middle East/North African) communities.

Multigenerational homes, skepticism vaccines, lack access insurance, lack social support new immigrants, etc factors give us insight COVID health factors effect specifically.

They make point probably even accurate count many MENA people US identifier census. 

I expectations going article thought raised good points. basically anything involved going house closed. Staying home, working home, playing games fine *its absolutely thing do* . fact didnt choose home time *forced* to.
Nah im clearly introvert life. difference introvert someitmes needs time alone, literally everything resembling anything fun human contact closed one straight year. even able see friend well, another human face outside house masks got old one month, let alone one year. It‚Äôs nice knowing won‚Äôt bored! people early retirement subs sometimes miserable. don‚Äôt get it. love chilling reading. one job actually liked coworkers coffee shop lasted 6 months. Even job didn‚Äôt like everyone. people bunch coworkers actually want spend time clock? people I‚Äôve worked difficult relate to. Maybe need find job another industry. Office work uniquely soul sucking. fully vaccinated, chances spreading virus incredibly low.  way infectious disease, arguably does. causes variety health costs, well strain hospitals, society large needs bear. get first dose, pandemic induced anxiety begin melt away. grossly understating effective 1st shot really is. data shows single shot ~60% effective two weeks. *extraordinarily good.* sum doses reached 60% would considered resounding victory. fantastic ELI5 Still yet risk dying COVID much higher. fact, risk dying cause much higher. Yes We‚Äôre fully outta pandemic...what‚Äôs hard understand Mods agreed me. ""spread rumours"" repeat best information available time, turned incorrect? long Trump takes credit? Place bets. Anti vaxxers may hospital can‚Äôt post. Dose 1 nothing unless already covid. Dose 2 like flu. 11 hours dose 2 felt like shit. Middle night chills fever. covers, like 101.6, nothing crazy. 14 hours started feeling bad over, I'm tired day 2.

I heart arrhythmia oddly heart decided perfectly normal fever. wife like seem almost happy. felt rhythm normal 2 years. Fever went away I'm back ol' bs. Keep information high quality. Got mine Thursday! I‚Äôm part really feel much anything second shot Tuesday. mean didnt work? Yes, people do. You‚Äôre likely feel much, much better tomorrow morning. feel well. I'm Japan expect get shot 2021. traveling US summer get vaccine, likely. data supporting pessimism like was. work bar restaurant industry, opposite story. One clients worried they'll clients feel comfortable asking varification.

It's going depend activity. person social gatherings, restaurant/bars, stores, etc I'd expect pushback precived events normally. performances/mass gatherings strangers, maybe different story....but touched really important: they, like everything else, time limit long we'll OK them. personal risks low, summer think we're going hard time getting businesses even mandates. vaccine came way fast liking. I've taken vaccines vaccines around years years. never rushed.

Happy see available. Days later, goal posts move again, Fauci says quadruple mask, doom gloom.

I'm done bs. Oklahoma never closed locked right? that‚Äôs case screw themselves. always interesting cope I've definitely focused later questioned myself. That's I'd go someplace day prevent worrying garage door, I'd snap quick picture phone easily verify timestamp included. overweight arguably biggest risk factor covid. 

That's fault groups society lead preferential treatment. Good. shouldn‚Äôt easy. like strict standards like nice, safe things. people also around people covid extended periods time close proximity long durations. important bit. vaccine still held 90 percent didn‚Äôt say that. Sigh 100% effective'

Ha! ha! **None are!** measles vaccine even good, way, way contagious Covid. come using excuse years ago regarding measles? answered right, thanks! Light arm exercises get things moving, big arm circles light weights, drink extra water. nurses saying move it, less sore be! Thx Anti-science? He‚Äôs literally one top minds field long track record scientific prestige. logic, didn‚Äôt try cling fame AIDS epidemic 80‚Äôs, received congressional medal freedom early 2000‚Äôs deserve slap face. know murican. Expect waves think bit early, hope see argument Canadian racists daily this-- right using number ""70"". central talking point, probably Ezra Levant cretin. actually care senior citizens, want excuse racist. really think President Biden modify US's vaccine strategy treat Canadian provinces like US states send appropriate level vaccines. two countries interconnected border closed way long. owe good neighbors. Sure know we've sent 1.5 million doses need send like 60 million. I‚Äôll still careful pre-Covid, I‚Äôm also looking forward things avoided prior receiving vaccine. enough people vaccinated yet. Oilberta Texas Canada?  See r/agedlikemilk 6 months! bit bullish expected shot sometime May. get second dose two weeks. racists same-- damned argument, every time. mother also 70, turned 71 actually. underlying health conditions. would much rather see Indigenous communities get vaccinated, obvious populations vulnerable, hit hard pandemic. number reasons, imperative get vaccine ASAP. Continuing deny simply shows everyone anti-Indigenous bigotry. think scare mongering greater contagiousness virulence short term, idea variants could completely evade vaccines, requiring masks 2022. PCR test (please avoid rapid ones can) 7‚Äì10 days contact. ends positive, yeah infected, otherwise, probably not. 

Being contact positive person mean becoming infected, COVID positives time contagious, many factors play. let test early may lead false negative. 

The vaccine *should* wasted, since theory, still lead mass spike production thus antibodies; immune system could stressed two things though Co workers mostly, started wonder honestly sort game going realized always said see would eventually say yes person would win pot Yeah Stitt sucks. Tulsa shut though. Yup... makes asshole practicing he's preaching, probably thinking matter one dinner party. Which, let's real - doesn't. every American shut houses entire past year entire leadership gallivanted around whatever fuck wanted, numbers would look 100 times better. matter scale. Obviously still makes complete fucking scumbags it, probably thought process.

It mean he's got nefarious motivations. douche. going take lot longer year fix damage done career. That's really sucks me. Either relief, fatigue side effect vaccine. 

No matter is, 9 hours sleep 9 hours sleep! vaccine effective! keep saying ""the spanish flu, spanish flu"" one tragedy worse invalidates one.

It sounds like need grow understand tragedy, fact spanish flu worse even come close invalidating that. latest numbers I've seen Pfizer vaccine 80% protected 2 weeks 95% protected 5 weeks. even 2 weeks protected. Good luck getting American support. Unfortunately, 70m us wanted another 4 years Trump, who's basically bolsanaro less intelligent. got invites? Well, last read, almost 50% Republican men planning getting vaccinated. That's fair share population. that's one group. really disagree main point, comparing masks handicapped spots stupid comparison. riteaid. got second shot last week! Maybe NH talk white house say need vaccines reasons, enact foolish policy harm NH. took *decades* happen. Isn‚Äôt everyone free travel? studies showing virus adapting warmer weather. look happening brazil hope knows you, stupid comment. public health restrictions still apply vaccinated people

Its frustrating people feel need ""reward"" get vaccinated. get can't wait rip mask middle target, got best society want worry killing family catch covid work. Early-mid may guess Sure Except public, prove immunized shop. stand town square announce covid. 

Many illnesses mandatory report already btw, guess know that. Furthermore, country mandatory sex workers get regulat HIV tests available customers (as porn industry). Guess like that? 

Also also, saying stigma associated HIV covid? saying? 

There's three options here: 1. Open without passport, accept consequences 2. open up, accept consequences 3. Open passports happy

Which one want? significantly better nothing obviously erroneous say they're equally good People still like blame poor comes minor changes viral fitness vs human behaviour.
The viruses properties less year ago. 
It's now. I'm getting mine today too. :) gonna date bro Wait correct I‚Äôm wrong isn‚Äôt rise cases right now, small considered wave far? Agreed. I‚Äôm sick self-righteous busybodies policing everyone dividing society. (And anti-maskers thing, I‚Äôm giving pass) Oh bet many will, minority best. get one can. six weeks spacing? new concept. also realistic consideration vaccination time scale, far greater risk creating variants selected later.

There's reason single leading authority recommending approach vaccination hard hit areas, everyone worried Brazil running wild. WFH screwed us long run. half went back May last year, another 25% came back last year. 25% continued WFH. shut office snow January rain early last month, everybody back office thought oh great! day off. Nah, work home take personal day, ‚Äúbecause working home‚Äù problem. Wfh folks thought getting day Bc office closed, nah...they work well too. we‚Äôll never get unexpected free days again. holidays already know have. [Except rhinovirus children (the study Japan, I've heard similar anecdotes North America).  Moderna Pfizer showing high efficacy 10-14 days first shot could easily get away restaurant especially gotten second. Fully vaccinated ensure longevity immunity well maximum efficacy 100% death could also people lower paying jobs financial security willy nilly make decisions might impact ability support themselves. relief nope, variants fucking brazil right Depending closely works affected person, protections (i.e. masks) wearing, gives small chance may contracted it.

It allergy season, sniffles unusual. wouldn‚Äôt worry much, even so, doubt would effect vaccine. factually correct. Netherlands slow respons told AZ go normal procedure applying funding. procedure quite slow took quite bit time. Netherlands finnaly ready reply AZ would fund plant. AZ already got agreement UK allot quicker effici√´nt communcicating AZ. VA area ahead state groupings months, sorry wait.  Might want read article lol. Sounds like living hell middle school.... antivaxxers demonstrated mental capacity toddlers. I'm guessing helps gov't handle logistics better end shipping receiving chain needs locations. Also may perk veterans? no, I'm wondering carry headline opinionated negative news. think ü§î bet tons healthy 25 year olds dropping dead COVID right ? Fake! Uber driver afford health insurance. Jk, hate stories agree you. Put Alt Right Facebook groups, need read shit. first wave ever end??? would think this? go fianc√©‚Äôs (trump loving) family gathering Easter tomorrow. vaccinated kids babies family (who aren‚Äôt obviously) said aren‚Äôt coming without everyone agreeing masks. I‚Äôm gonna drunk af handle shit... already hate Easter. Montrealers noticed mass vaccination site lying nearly empty week, one province says it‚Äôs temporary: intentionally slowed pace Montreal order let regions catch up. forget people natural immunity. is. new strain that‚Äôs shown weakens vaccine. So. Yay COVID-19 vaccines don‚Äôt protect organ-transplant patients, study 436 organ-transplant recipients got first two doses Moderna Pfizer vaccines, 17% developed detectable antibodies, immune system‚Äôs first line defense disease-causing germs. 


There study started see also problems people immunosuppressants autoimmune diseases likewise effected.

these people deserve die went grocery shopping medical caregiver anti vax &amp; allowed know it. yes, everyone loves hall monitor/bully. /s must stressful you, least circle provide support. 

Stay safe, good redditor. believe US giving Canada Mexico stockpile AZ.  honestly don‚Äôt think does, someone works tested positive today he‚Äôs come contact it. 10-14 days first shot 90% efficacy admit media fear mongering virus entire time?

Thank you. Lol everyone probably thinks annoying busybody that. Control freak behaviour sure. went 40,000 cases day last week 60,000 Tuesday, 65,000 yesterday... 70,000+ today. Yes, clearly Covid going away now! great news.

? Okay. Still variant. I'm sorry! I'm glad things improving. definitely keeping mind many people lost loved ones. Fauci said something positive? Wow. double take. Please avoid reposting information. understand Johnson &amp; Johnson's clinical trial actually least impressive protection CV-19 infection, needs understand primary endpoint. 

Only Johnson &amp; Johnson set primary efficacy objective prevention moderate severe COVID-19. (Not mile asymptomatic.) really want protect infection severity Pfizer, Moderna Novavax primary efficacy objective preventing COVID-19, matter severity.

This clinical trial register J&amp;J trial. LOL cdc always make bold claims I‚Äôm concerned although many received vaccines, there‚Äôs plenty people intention getting waiting approved. spring break travelers East coast Easter weekend, don‚Äôt see won‚Äôt see another wave.   know anything Brazil variant? produce sizes now. I‚Äôd expect plenty providers able use 15 doses managing open appointments. Like, vaccine appointments Tuesday scheduled 9-12 ensure vials used efficiently.

Smaller providers might order smaller vials different brand fewer doses.  Cool stay home 2025 one wants around anyways feel going sister's 200+ person wedding Texas month...

...she just, care. Said got vaccine go honeymoon another country summer. said ""if get covid, fine months wedding."" hard understand DONT want covid want risk GIVING people? One thing people know Katy ISD gives parents children option attending class in-person online, sister junior year high school right now. April fools! article:

Despite new order, state still encouraging people voluntarily wear masks setting interacting people outside household.

‚ÄúI look forward day immunity reaches level longer wear masks,‚Äù Polis said written statement Friday. ‚ÄúRight across state, 1 207 people currently contagious COVID-19, estimated 27% Coloradans already immune either vaccination prior infection. meantime, must continue practicing vigilance wearing masks, especially aren‚Äôt yet fully vaccinated, practicing social distancing public company people unknown vaccine status. modified mask order step towards light end tunnel.‚Äù

and

Biden critical states ‚Äî like Texas, Mississippi, Florida Arkansas ‚Äî rolling back COVID-19 restrictions, saying leaders showing ‚ÄúNeanderthal thinking.‚Äù states fully dropped mask mandates led Republican governors. Polis Democrat.  sound disappointed die Arm definitely sore injection site. Kinda sore like mild flu starting feel better already. I'm sure I'll fine morning. thankful say, one them. Take heart knowing J&amp;J trialled SA, hard mode. Title sex tape. stop acting like Fauci second coming christ. someone says political etc sure love spotlight first wave ever stop there??? you? think it‚Äôs 5pm everywhere? could later pharmacy open later? Thanks! mean, logic say vaccine safe 1 100,000 bad side effect. guess I‚Äôm also extreme introvert don‚Äôt miss way impacts mental health. Would nice go coffee shop see movie out? Sure, honestly don‚Äôt care much. whole experience made realize happy hanging home little family. Extrovert here. definitely say overall mood decline past year. chat anyone anything pleasure, idk could confidence anymore. Haven‚Äôt seen closet friends year, shit difficult type people, won‚Äôt lie you. think every single dau bet you‚Äôre blast parties. Introvert here. personal life changed since always alone home. work got worse badly understaffed. 2020 meant mood decline me. Given work independently mask discipline best, serves us right wear time. 7 us, 4 tested positive, 3 got symptoms. variants easily overwhelm region matter 1 2 weeks exponential growth.

Not regions high percentage immunity via cases vaccinations. acting like either nothing. want option pick airline requires proof vaccine one doesn't?

And capitalist utopia, I'm sure still welcome show vaccination status front desk want to. result exactly same.

If concerned vaccination status, go get antibody test confirm protected. back 2019. Canada good progress. would love see J&amp;J shot exported bulk developing countries. one-shot you‚Äôre safe hospitalization. would sound like pipe-dream time lay year Deaths lag behind cases. Celebrate haven‚Äôt ticked month now. Hospitalization states seeing rise cases, I‚Äôm afraid. Please breed. That's me. Got really hot, light headed, felt might pass out, fine. Kind like might feel blowing balloon fast makes sense. average restrictions state like Massachusetts Pennsylvania ton restrictions...that would directly imply are, fact, A-Ok.

0 deaths goal. Never been, never be. show putting anyone else around risk, vaccinated novel virus spread others...
And again...don't need prove vaccinated enroll school? like new concept government implementing control. bother. many Americans variant denial 16.5% fully vaccinated variants twice dangerous. 4th wave coming probably worst yet. usual, ignorance lack adequate preparation paves way excessive cases deaths world's richest nation. Japan small households many elderly either live entirely alone spouse. never inappropriate ask sources. shouldn‚Äôt required activities daily living. vaccine proof negative test required activities daily living anywhere world. Tuberculosis kills millions every year. Walmart doesn‚Äôt require shoppers present negative PPD, Covid shouldn‚Äôt different. We‚Äôd rather waste year life responsible citizens waste whole lifetime playing video games. Make sure shave neck beard turning Newsmax. odd many Redditors ""science"" suddenly ignoring science favor scary headlines. Also, grass green sky blue.  Didn‚Äôt Fauci publish paper using masks 1918 pandemic caused lots diseases?  pretty sure situation here.! got 2nd whenever poop Bill Gates sends spam e mail. Risk death covid probably low people 20s/30s/40s well no? Again, point people want information everyone make responsible decisions themselves. govts saying ‚Äúpls trust us it‚Äôs safe swear.‚Äù see COVID deaths US, hiccup, resumed decline, even cases tick again. deaths resumed decline US even cases increase. We're it. We're really turning disease something closer flu every day. Haha get it. introvert though, makes life easier right now. I‚Äôm enjoying lasts. know nothing UK roadmap lockdown. Case spread irrelevant. loosen restrictions vaccinate people. trying eliminate COVID, especially given real world data shows Pfizer's vaccine efficacy claimed optimistic clinical trials. towel soak water piece steel? understand fully need study idea wasting resources perform depth studies concepts easily proven. Unfortunately, one at-risk person left family isn‚Äôt vaccinated super paranoid thinks might well still March 2020. 

He‚Äôs type person stirs panic it‚Äôs raining outside. Agreed. Internal passports suggested every single tragedy befalls us. proposed 9/11 combat terrorism. way solve immigration. people proposing care absolutely none whatever ruse they're using enact them. want system means control.

The ACLU wrote article 20 years ago came then: 

Every bullet point still valid now. *not* a-ok. average amongst US states pandemic killing citizens every day. That's great. sub incredibly anti-CDC, yes. That's also fact. literally data showing besides one often derided study one area Brazil? 

I agree everyone needs get vaccinated. Full stop. also agree least 20% without coercion incentive. Well considering 7 people 18 million jabs given would say much specific risk group. every 1 person that's died there's probably 100,000 people age group gender. Probably not. live somewhere takes active role infringing upon rights. Legally, need license person every time drive. Hope get better soon. Keep resting. Covid last summer tough day back normal pretty darn quick.

Did two spread everyone? masked up? talking US brazil? Middle-upper class introverts* illnesses need approximately 1/6 antibodies needed prevent illness order prevent severe illness. still think somewhat air although agree substantial loss antibody protection. Somewhere neighborhood tenfold would lower average antibody numbers convalescent serum 500 50. course need higher amount antibodies neutralize thing effect would go up. Guess shopping Amazon, dining Uber Eats next pal Two plans attack I'd recommend here. book CVS, select need schedule second vaccination (and choose vaccine). double checked Massachusetts works CVS there. I'd recommend try get appointment either way, calling local pharmacies/clinics, explaining situation, getting placed waste lists he'll get shot there's extra dose EOD. Government allowing private businesses operate please government overreach. want option pick airline requires proof vaccine one doesn't? government taking choice me. Yeah, extrovert really rough me. period drinking heavily, day. Luckily got handle now, still. go weeks without seeing anyone, gets lonely. Gaming friends helps isnt same. way works get sick miss work. sick days get fired. job lose employer-sponsored health insurance.

Now sick *and* unemployed. call freedom. Mask compliance close 100% part US year still got repeat waves. Cars?. forum full dickheads gatekeeping option. Lmao. I've saying beginning. I've much happier since covid social distancing. want near anyone else sorry. want home alone, I'm much happier guy COVID's payroll

And yet end result squarely middle terms performance. Better Cuomo explicit real evidence hid death toll: measures work, like vaccines, come on, lockdowns failed move needle, think internal passports going anything antagonize people changing trajectory covid all? Japan never really tested much probably tons uncounted cases there. would really extreme reaction. want able say ""no can't come over"" ""no want socialize I'm already socially drained"" without taking personally. getting vaccine anyways ...what's harm showing proof got it? Yes, serious. People need know this. Consider comment public service announcement. 


20-25% people dead set getting vaccinated. There's probably another sizable cohort thinks need already covid. even one person second cohort reads article posted decides get vaccinated case worth thawkth's downvote. Infection immunity titers South Africa looked ineffective variant except people life-threatening illness first time. Much Florida surprisingly spared covid despite happening Miami. rest state average levels covid. Lack critical thinking? shit lol Yeah, alone feels lot less abnormal everyone else alone too. Shocking. Gonna need re-visit ""fact"" is.

Spoiler: mean ""opinion stated delusional confidence"". extroverts know Facebook spent lot time trying thread ""I believe science believe restrictions"" needle throughout 2020. like loved first like 6 months, got bored

like really bored words, don‚Äôt walk back burning building firefighters arrived. friends still crap time time joining outdoor hangs. Lol Yeah, younger older getting vaccinated more. ""Maybe extrovert"" vision meme 
If study conducted January-March, said, looking OG covid. examined effective mRNA vaccines work real world, ultimately matters  don't. one checking ID engine turns over.

Plus plenty people walk rideshare Chipotle.

Next. speaking truth, hate it. Extroverted people energized social interaction. surprising staying home associated decreased mood. This. Explain.

Vaccine passports nature big government. Big government control people's movements, limit access restrict services. Congrats!! He‚Äôs talking risk specific people. much doubt young women among thousands dying covid, risk blood clots vaccine. People want transparency. You‚Äôve missed point think ‚Äúit‚Äôs like it‚Äôs huge medical procedure‚Äù changes anything wrote. scale procedure irrelevant fact it‚Äôs still medical procedure. debate merits getting vaccine. biggest issue discussed required show proof activities daily living. unprecedented. I‚Äôm talking possibility show enter grocery stores, go ball games. personal opinion desires masks go away right away. reality what's happening... Reddit user making decisions. people lot power send pretty strong signals okay okay made sort decisions. don‚Äôt think anyone surprised Dolly Parton amazing person would follow hell. I'll delete comment show Biden saying he'll recommend ending mask mandates majority Americans vaccinated. 10 today delay reporting due bank holiday weekend.  expect big spike tue/we'd. US, requirement expired end year strangely applied companies *under* certain size.

When got COVID, three weeks fortunate enough vacation time accrued cover that. Otherwise would've lost 3/4 monthly income. Ah. Found New York health agency clarified statement Thursday, saying ‚Äúthe evidence isn‚Äôt clear‚Äù Walensky ‚Äúspeaking broadly.‚Äù

Honestly, Director felt like okay say spread post-vaccination agency walking back, conclude someone higher told CDC walk back claim. shit confirm, I'm anxiety attacks every day I'm less suicidal  Tahoe last week, middle week. number people blatantly disregarding social distancing (even 6ft long skis boards on) almost shocking number people wearing masks line lift. staffer clearly tired telling every person put mask getting chair. felt pretty safe first shot week earlier wearing two masks goggles. happy guy insisted hoping lift immediately took mask chat up. 

I know masks aren‚Äôt great, none precautions fun. damnit hold little bit longer... agree they're going useful short amount time, even implemented. proves point. going short term inconvenience.

For people got shot offered yet/they can't get legitimate medical reasons, would want go places high infection risk? wait little longer till get vaccine herd immunity low enough required, I'm sure within year states. people simply ""don't want it"" ignorant live consequences decisions.

""Permanently"" excluding people? Even used, know fact permanently excluding people. It'll act stop gap slowly allow people vaccinated return normal setting whereas rest us catch up. cases low zero vaccine passports go away lads go wine night TGIFs again.

If showing proof got vaccine (that I'm planing getting anyways) would allow able grab pint friends seen year+, would gladly show it. skin nose, beats pouting making miss wait system stop used ""working"" bet trouble ""collaborating"" Open office plans seemed managers undiagnosed ADHD productivity. Hopefully people dumb realize happens specific demogrpahic, far, far smaller 18 million. surpassed 4m vaccinations reported single day, **AND** also surpassed 3m vaccinations 7-day average! ü•≥ already taken language isn‚Äôt objectionable anyway, please stick unedited titles. least direct quotes, though may always appropriate.

‚ÄúHigher levels extraversion, example, found related decreases mood pandemic progressed contrast lower extraversion, slight increase mood time.‚Äù reality slowly returning I'm feeling anxious... prefer socially distant society people caring hygine want end. contrary science. says mask majority vaccinated, period. dont believe facts yes, might crazy enough think masks pandemic good, that's literal definition dumb thinking. feel that. I've living best life year! Everything outside quiet, everything much less busy.

Feel like used struggle day-to-day, I've really enjoyed it. Damn, feel this. July. I‚Äôm dude haven‚Äôt mentioned company‚Äôs name once. Wasn‚Äôt pushing anything. Yes confident traditional medicine new age medicine. like still use record player wired headphones digital music AirPods. I‚Äôm old school. Get it. This. day.  80% two weeks first dose. almost nothing 10 days first dose though. No, don't. name vaccinated status something I'm comfortable business having. like it? partake businesses require show proof vaccination. I'm making choice you, take choice me. already new that. introvert. usually keep small group friends go occasion. travel much either, past year issue, like people stressed able go away make big deal it. Deep kind smile that, knowing brings joy hear stupid vacations. mean? WFH days stayed home family pets day every day, wasn‚Äôt forced obligatory social situations (Firm events; parties, etc.) literally best days life. 

I got extra three+ hours day saved commuting getting ready office. productive ever regarding quality work product time took complete projects. like machine without all-day-distractions people coming office, phone ringing, etc. 

Obviously idea people getting sick dying stressful, much usual everyday stress completely disappeared. enough sleep first time years years, time work run, time cook healthy meals. 

Working home really suited me, one lucky ones actually enjoyed extra family time. 

Now I‚Äôm back working office, home ten hours day work days, I‚Äôve found way stressed, constantly tired, closeness developed family slipped away little since gone ways day, nights rushed don‚Äôt time deeper conversations nowhere go. 

I felt guilty whole time enjoying quarantine many people much pain, still feel guilty admitting much enjoyed here, honestly- thrived time. wish could go back working home people sick dying. suggesting it‚Äôs better tell young women AstraZeneca safe appears supply safe alternative isn‚Äôt readily available yet? can‚Äôt even imagine volunteer giving 25 year old healthy woman AstraZeneca. wouldn‚Äôt want conscience.

I sincerely hope American regulators paying close attention mess. point, I‚Äôd favor giving entire AstraZeneca supply country promises use populations appear fine‚Äîmen, older women. originally come good faith, appreciate come aggressively some.

I appreciate taking time state side things well thought manner, supporting evidence. 

I guess question is, see lasting longer year, even implemented all. see would like stop gap solution vaccinations ramp up, allow return life vaccinated.

I appreciate separated year this, see lasting long, implemented all.

To second point, know entire political structure Denmark, see extreme measures passed, especially N.A.

To third point, generally agree. gonna lot cost time set up, used long. opposed passport system, see even implemented constraints brought up. come pass, still think ""freedom restricting"" people claiming, allowing freedoms available year some, acting stop gap vaccinations pan out.

Again appreciate taking time respond, civily, hope find acted civily return.

Also thanks insulting Canada, thread haha sucks. would take oxygen? promise you, college much fun. wanna go back can't I'm gonna beg semester off. Doesnt help none friends returning States widely responsible rollout. secure doses already happening ya nonetheless good country. since turned slight rise

You‚Äôre downplaying bit. It‚Äôs pretty big rise. 10% around 16 states, 20-30% small handful others. Lol okay

Don‚Äôt let news article bother u then. still cold made sick though? Yeah... Ok, that's gunna dawg. you‚Äôre Israel currently US UK six weeks now, okay. we‚Äôre quite yet. Well said. Thank post information. thank providing info needed hear. I‚Äôve lost lot trust people last 16 months become skeptic. Maybe need shed that. Take care stay safe. actually not. I'm introverted. know enjoy social interaction, especially people already know, makes really tired need spend hours something recharge. That's introverted means. mean deathly afraid social interaction wanting little social interaction possible, means social interaction makes tired need time alone recharge afterwards. ""majority"" quantifiable number. Come back one. Yeah, I‚Äôm gonna freshman college next year. don‚Äôt want online classes fall. Especially considering I‚Äôm getting vaccinated soon. Extrovert well. spent last summer floating aimlessly pool day drinking white claws, crying, listening Taylor Swift.

And infinitely better I've coped last 6 winter months. I‚Äôve went 2M day 3M day March, think we‚Äôll get 4 4.5M doses day April. Here‚Äôs link yeah, it‚Äôs stupid error point Walensky spoke broadly interview,‚Äù agency spokesman told Times. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible people fully vaccinated could get Covid-19. evidence isn‚Äôt clear whether spread virus others. continuing evaluate evidence.‚Äù private businesses.

Ahh yes. Nothing wrong private corporations access tracking data, huh? believe governments absolutely nothing prevent sort privacy violations? Really? honestly don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôve said it. It‚Äôs silly thing say. ‚ÄúHuge cause reinfections‚Äù oxymoron itself, even would say something like worst here.

Until get link proof I‚Äôm doubtful CDC said thing. Ha ha. power extroverts! Thank you, appreciate it. Truly. Third wave hitting everyone really hard. political theatre.

Not really. applies ""people Florida want go grocery store"" ""people Florida want go movies"", aka entire population. good Bitcoin. 4 mil day might cap, depends quick J&amp;J end getting doses out. Moderna Pfizer given us 200 mil doses end month, 180 million doses, 3.1 million/day.  

At end day probably capped supply. Let's go USA! got first shot today üëè want believe. :) Alex berenson one 40% adults least one dose, too. Almost certainly going majority within couple weeks. Incredible stuff. I'm still little upset see majority initiating April, administration side ramping dramatically hard upset even weeks ago.

I surprised if, end April, see many states opening appointment vaccinations. got mine without appointment, would like see become formal process, everyone enough interest go inconvenient confusing process scheduling something. vulnerable vaccinated, we're essentially point now, available enough doses available anyone walks CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Target, whatever else wants one spot. like flu vaccine. elaborate hormone missing teeth? saying mRNA technology (or however call it) regenerate new cell growth? apologize advance getting mean. Hooray passing 3mil/ day milestone!

Though know deep Zags win üòâ Jesus, that‚Äôs unfortunate see. Thank pointing out. daughter exposure school week tested positive w/ PCR, negative w/ rapid test Thursday. kid class tested negative w/ PCR, positive w/ rapid test (not sure day, classroom got closed Thursday, probably Thursday). one else house tested positive either. tested Thursday today (still waiting PCR today). 

I‚Äôm trying figure source virus. kid kid? Could unrelated? far daughter symptoms, wife slight headaches, 4 weeks past first moderna shot. feel like worst it, maybe test positive next days. I‚Äôll keep getting tested every day. We‚Äôll see goes. 

Nothing really except quarantine point. 

In mind, positive PCR negative rapid indicates early infection. Whereas opposite longer infection, right? I‚Äôm dumbfounded kid negative PCR, maybe false negative. kid asymptomatic too, must exposure justify testing, would think. I‚Äôm rambling now, I‚Äôm bored looking barrel 20 day quarantine. introverted people live extroverted people? Death rates under-50s lot lower elderly. differential hospitalizations nearly great. try open society wide open again, everyone takes masks goes back bars concerts church choirs, could still massive spike cases hospitalizations, point hospital system gets overwhelmed again. course, get many people chronic COVID organ damage, uncommon among under-50s. get much living work hours lost still serious disease.

Is less likely vaccination began? Sure. is, say, 20% under-50s vaccinated enough stop another massive spike? Possibly ‚Äî knife's edge.

So run society knife's edge we're two months away able say ""okay, pretty damn sure explode ever again?"" I'm talking lockdowns, I'm saying keep masks cautious large indoor gatherings sure.

Tell me: I'm saying truly, view, ridiculous mark? Spread issue people vaccinated right fraction fully vaccinated.

Why basic stuff difficult you? applies state agencies. 

The federal government controls interstate travel. 

That means, want fly Florida, may still required TSA federal regulatory agency present vaccine passport (if becomes federal all) traveling Florida. 

This political theatre. Unless live Florida wanted visit state park worried park ranger would ask vaccine passport, won‚Äôt really apply 80% people fly Florida vacation. LESGOOOOOOO That's FOMO works. think people socially anxious avoidant like it. I've said lots places, introversion much social interaction drains you, much actually like social interaction. I'm introverted often leave events early become much me, enjoy I'm there. I've hated whole pandemic because, I'm introverted, I'm human humans need social interaction, mention enjoy social interaction makes tired. realize that's government system? private businesses. also really thing all. again, worried point, freedom choose via free market. Study finds water wet.. Yeah, sorry conversation went way did. Disheartening see. 

I‚Äôd adjust goalposts terms evaluating dat, least concerns allowing hope. said, *most* spike mutations would impact vaccine efficacy. Even produce decrease efficacy, vaccine going 95% even something like 70% efficacy mean variant automatically get ‚Äútake off‚Äù. data coming positive, anyway. Well course high risk population vaccinated (i.e. 70s) going keep deaths down. However help everyone else much - lockdown comes in, indeed necessary time. get high speed internet phones that? :) ‚ÄúAnd isn‚Äôt going permanent thing.‚Äù

Ahh see, disagree. course doesn‚Äôt seem like big deal perspective, think perspective incredibly naive. research covaxin. tons research done India regarding covaxin. mention research trails conducted IQVIA. Lol reported? stock company believe vaccine. notice haven‚Äôt even mentioned name company that‚Äôs I‚Äôm trying here. Funny thing found vaccine company subreddit. hooked ever since. Please research covaxin think you‚Äôll understand that‚Äôs vaccine want. I‚Äôm gonna make bold statement even say covaxin used booster variants United States hopefully around world. faith bharat bioscience produced 60 percent vaccines still used around world today. Willing bet you‚Äôve received vaccine lifetime well. wife‚Äôs boss same. turns people likely don‚Äôt need nothing middle management guy, tend extroverted and, least case wife, guy using authority create social interactions himself.

Congratulations go tell friends Biden awesome even though he‚Äôs using cages Trump accused horrible for

What said?

You literally came misguidedly promote rapey nonce get called first response start crying ""but abouuuut"" like little boy.

Grow son. absolutely IDEA get vaccine. government, one richest countries world, first said May, June, August. That‚Äôs vaccinations for. personal risk low, I‚Äôll wait what‚Äôs best too.

As people *cant* vaccinated, always risk every disease pre-covid well. Weirdly, opposite experience. Would've wait weeks get shot Oakland County, got earlier week Highland Park. Could've also gotten Ludington, though, fit rule haha Two 4,000,000 dose days row big deal. might hit 4,000,000 day average sometime month. I'm sure we're going hit 5,000,000 average sole reason that, certain point, we're going run Americans vaccinate. We're already point 1% Americans adults getting dose every single day, 40% adults gotten least one dose.

There's chance hell see 5,000,000 dose day ends, number Americans simply might see consistently. again, we're seeing consistent 4,000,000 days right now, knows. final days vaccination effort could see people getting vaccines early months. confused Americans, important remember England people used idea everyone follows rules. Unlike US laws differ state, even county, level, England don't. Americans may accept idea vaccinated people different rules follow unvaccinated people, people England don't. 

Our roadmap lockdown already set place. Social contact rules decrease gradually June, when, everything goes plan, people completely free meet whomever want. It‚Äôs miracle, pretty much nothing science miracle pass 4 mln doses reported administered single day, 7-day average also surpassed 3m/day.

And what‚Äôs exciting able celebrate incredible milestones later today watching UCLA Bruins destroy Gonzaga Final Four! Nah. 

My 2nd dose Wednesday. Giving required 11-14 days I'm going full mask off, living life normal.

If place wants proof vaccination, I'll turn around walk right guarantee there's another place next door take money.

I go indoor concerts sporting events they're stuffy lame. I'll wait fall go LSU games Voodoo Fest Nola.

Thanks though. like 2024 gonna even use still use all

Not single anti terrorism measures implemented 9/11 revoked. absolutely guarantee become permanent almost that. all, risk new pandemics persist, seems society accept risk zero anymore. I‚Äôve heard first dose provides around 80% immunity. that‚Äôs remember reading somewhere last week. La county finally Osaka. feel proud? sports teams say good, can't wrong. false. Latest estimates the
UK Covids R0 factor 0.7 0.9. similar R0 tuberculosis developed world, however lesser developed areas see tuberculosis R0s 4. average 1.7. Tuberculosis also deadly. Hey /u/Wizmaxman , yo thang. *You merely adopted dark. born it, molded it. see light already man.* come kind agreement? FOMO don‚Äôt want go? Ah, yes.

Bravo. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sad thing actually probably believe said justify lockdowns would (will...) work much dramatically something faster incubation cycle rapid symptoms.

There's reason 2020-21 flu season. SHIT Tired celebrity worship. pass 4 mln doses reported administered single day, 7-day average also surpassed 3m/day.

And what‚Äôs exciting able celebrate incredible milestones later today watching UCLA Bruins destroy Gonzaga Final Four! give time. takes people get caught information. stuff came last days Global median age 30. absurd sentiment. Public schools even exist human history everyone back suffering ""damage"" equivalent life-long medical conditions. 

The reality untenable conditions workers Capitalism, providing consistent care attention one's family members incompatible paying bills, created crisis care long precedes pandemic. Instead devoting resources resolving issues (i.e. paying people care children pandemic otherwise), governments decided play workers (those working schools vs. working elsewhere). Dammit I‚Äôm getting antsy turn can‚Äôt tell you‚Äôre goofing around don‚Äôt understand point trying make.
No numbers wrong, statements true-
-160,000,000 doses given. (Your link)
-100,000,000 Americans received least one dose (the headline we‚Äôre discussing) bizarre little boy are. Right. Let‚Äôs listen experts may learn update message based new information.

Our politicians obviously know better scientists. Let‚Äôs open everything way back up. ‚Äúright‚Äù thing isn‚Äôt always popular thing. currently bottleneck, mean setting new facility hard long task. Getting mass produce lipid nanoparticles actually take long, certainly less time coating vaccine nanoparticles (which different stage) obviously far less manufacturing vaccine itself. ‚Äúcrying wolf‚Äù Europe, Canada parts US currently middle new wave that‚Äôs caused contagious variants? effect masks transmission rate must assessed.

Which country?

Yes, biggest problems seem people integrating presymptomatic spread, lying symptoms. Seems like it, first pharmacy appointments month signed last Monday. plus side, state rollout seems going well. definitely don‚Äôt think mood improvements. think it‚Äôs affected less extroverts. positives I‚Äôve enjoyed, doesn‚Äôt mean actually good me. variants cause young much sicker.

Is source this? Genuinely asking cause I'd like read it.  beginning pandemic? Ha, group friends *still* almost every week. we're also lot performing arts/theatre people mostly extroverts. Gotta kind outlet. introverted people group dropped group video chats pretty early on, though, valid. What!?!?  Good. guy. recent studies also shown people's antibodies also create variants time variants work variant virus still protected.

This gross misrepresentation immune system works. 

Your antibodies evolve time specific *to original strain infected with*. you‚Äôre infected variant shares overlapping features original, process help. variant changed enough avoid immune system, immune system isn‚Äôt going adjust recognize it. way.

One side: Possibly million deaths COVID less year.

Other side: Complete destruction modern way life.

Answer: Lie everyone, lose public trust, trash economy preventing ability reasonable discussion finding solutions actually impact. Take ""all restrictions good"" mindset rely mostly shaming people unenforceable things defy every human instinct control pandemic rather continuing make strong push towards sustainable measures like actual national mass testing program, focused development better tests, preparation schools hosting kids spaced-out environments.

Nicely done guys! it! Great point. Used teeth falling dreams time might *barely* enough vaccinations highest risk groups far avert total catastrophe, want put foot easing restrictions better keep it. Decades lead poisoning dumbed population here. I'm quite introverted, need human contact. Unfortunately introversion makes harder build maintain real friendships, covid made even harder. Thanks Trump Operation Warp Speed ""I'm sorry, thought America!""  Pfizer enough data apply full FDA authorization. Hopefully thats comes soon, employers start requiring vaccines. large vaccine skeptic/apathic population US thing that‚Äôs gonna push us herd immunity numbers vaccinations requiring vaccinations surge then? fuck goal kind normalcy summer? families friends others, vaccinated ... large chuck population ü§¶üèª American Healthcare system... TRYING times Actually interestingly michigan's test rates stayed pretty consistent. know states, testing remained high. Honestly governor pretty awesome. stayed diligent. able stop traveling. January hit Michiganders started traveling like crazy country mexico escape winter. partied, wear masks follow guidelines went came home. brought uk brazil variants them. I'm seeing people texas, colorado, florida etc traveling here.

So hundreds thousands people flooding Michigan country spike, travel back home too. anyone recruit 5k people, determined antibody status, put MRI, 1k values bloodwork, ECG, ultrasound? pretty sure million dollares study costs would pay minutes publication. Auto translate pretty good, suspect tampons bit translated incorrectly. Anyone know correct English word would ""for claims seems action individual, gravity reprehensible act remains, hit facility deals vaccines **tampons**, managed Civil Defense Alpine troops, municipal soil.""

Introverted heavily isolated (except work, masked times, in-person meetings canceled year). Suffered ill mood decline. I've quite enjoyed mandatory separation. Meanwhile Germany 10 million, it‚Äôs ridiculous Vaccination numbers still low am, it‚Äôs reasonable assumption. people see restaurants area 50, 50 weren‚Äôt eligible last week. understand, however, restaurant worker you‚Äôre eager get back work.

And 10 people count immediately infected spring, single person vaccinated yet. Lol. 

You see new wave happening right Europe? one Michigan (and starting across northeast US)? That‚Äôs contagious variants. It‚Äôs fear mongering, it‚Äôs reality playing right front you. [Kyle segment CDC's damaged reputation never recover. ignore completely. unfortunately every country situation u.s.a.

I'm part better humanity. Yeah, thought weird. many people dreams like that. think it‚Äôll end long lived classic like naked school dream teeth falling out. [Archive also lactating vaccinated. kiddo fine. doctor fine it.

I'm 100 % would done pregnant, breastfeeding easy choice Yea lot bars area reopened, one sit bar right now. barstools gone!!!  also consider situation China in. They're really rush vaccinate, EU desperately get back semblance normalcy. Basic science also knowing efficacy means.

All vaccines proven track recorded 100% death/hospitalization.

So that‚Äôs that. Finally, good news terrible thing. There's hope end. sure factors would play.

More contagious variants. sub plugging it‚Äôs ears pretending big deal, are. know talking about.

Within next hour hit like brick. running 104F fever. highest I‚Äôve ever ran. morning feeling much better. could different everyone, experience. mean makes sense. We'll test theory weeks ;_; Plus hopefully getting Novavax approved May also greatly increase supply. I'm honestly convinced y'all **want** another surge. Oh please! seems like places barely closed. 

I live NYC, overall people really get it. Mask compliance really good majority people, ethnic groups thinking exempt. think bit collective PTSD. year could listen outside realize heard sirens literally day long non stop. eerie feeling.

But even so, indoor dining back open, cannot understand that‚Äôs safe percentage people fully vaccinated gets much higher.

From nurses Facebook claiming (anti) vaccine experts way neuroradiologist pretending MD allows comment intelligently epidemiology complex immunological processes highest level government, lot people stepped well scope practice.

Keep jabs coming! got HIV I‚Äôm fucking RAW crazy? vaccination even people get notably died hospitalized completely agree!  Unless, course, amount alone time ""forced"" close amount choose yourself, power refuse demands normally put you.

Not tell people ""no"" time reinforce personal time/space boundaries lifted huge emotional weight. Sooooo ... long South Africa Brazil variant takes variant X? Hmm, Variant X sounds like movie title ... want people ha e show papers prove vaccinated attend concerts travel, want people show papers able vote. Well might good idea sit wear mask safe then.

I mean, true, still... Hopefully not.  world needs religion go way dinosaurs--extinct. poster literally EU tried playing nice spirit cooperation export bans UK &amp; US mean thanks EUs selfless behavior dead EU citizens. 

This part addressed. going decide part comment replied?

I've explicitly stated issue EU blocking export facilities either built EU built corporations explicitly EU (priority) production. 100% fair just.

The problem EU threatened passed law enables ban exports Pfizer manufacturing facilities, aka steal doses belong them. Yes. fact people bit both. Fucking hell, anything paper! away wallet years ago contactless... put phones something, let's go backwards ü§¶ Second dose next week! I‚Äôm pumped! people thread really don‚Äôt know introvert is.

News flash, there‚Äôs difference introvert absolute anti social shut Really? worst possible idea?

I come couple dozen things would worse. hides emotions. 

But considering probably care about, go get fucking checked in. mRNA vaccines turned astonishingly effective, good news keeps coming in. Every continent building factories - Covid, mRNA technology 'dial-a-vaccine' (and potentially even 'dial-a-therapy'), standby response emerging pathogens. Obesity often cause things like diabetes, heart lung issues, etc. things make people vulnerable Covid. 

Being old too. Something like 85% deaths USA people 65. would guess Italy Greece high rates bad outcomes populations skew older. 1 5 Italians roughly % Greeks 65. zero question connected worse Covid outcomes countries. Obviously worst case scenario old *and* obese. 

It's judgement people obese (or old, both, obviously), denying connection things worse Covid outcomes fiction. I'm vastly less likely bad outcome catch Covid youngish person obese simply comorbidities. would assume infection would less hard you, due initial immunity. knows degree though. Cause think vaccines going end civilization something. like living alone. You‚Äôre crazy much small government, free market nonsense GOP likes tout. mean no. There's huge difference saying, ""black culture allow success white society,"" ""black culture evolved away white society black people systematically denied access society, need make moves inclusive.""

Not sure got idea I'm advocating pouring money schools. need paradigm shift way think black values, need ensure black people rewarded constructive things forgiven stray, like white people. means policing prison reform. means ending discriminatory hiring practices. means progressive tax systems erase widening gap started rich started poor.

This way thinking still blame black society misfortune place onus fix it. onus rest us. Wow could bad. should‚Äôve known, mother created appointment me. got South Carolina. Maybe something it, yes, reading information sheet, saw patient 18+. strange indeed. cry immediately getting mine (J&amp;J) came close passing felt woozy hour. whole thing strange happy hit hard, physically.  anticipated getting first second dose, think environment holding us car 15 minutes, middle cow field west Texas mind somewhere else. 

My wife let tear got back car first dose CVS. teacher, she‚Äôs grateful. arm still hurts two days out. Feels like bruised muscle. Imagine looking piece cloth feeling way. Go get fucking checked in. beginning pandemic lockdowns established nationwide discouraged visit fellow community members:

The response linked says none doses produced Marburg facility leave EU, totally fine position have.

The EU block exports BT/Pfizer faciltiy Belgium, pay it.

The Marburg facility specifically built paid expand production capacities within EU.

Why ok US,India even China block exports production facilites paid for, someone mentions possibility EU it, people go crazy? work Finance. speak business partners, must use extremely precise language - that's ""only"" hundreds millions dollars line.

I'm introverted nature experienced pretty serious decline mental health/mood. think lot people conflate introversion social anxiety/avoidance, that's really thing. like around people, quite frequently someone extroverted. need time social events recharge, much time leaves anxious depressed. know we‚Äôre approaching tail end 15 minutes fame soon count that, thanks would agree there‚Äôs enough ambiguity might right there‚Äôs also surveys showing roughly half republicans currently don‚Äôt plan taking vaccine (compared 11% democrats 30% independents). Also, would expect rural areas would stock less vaccine serve smaller population.

True. However, I'll explain later, also influenced non-political factors. I.e., correlation equaling causation. people say Republican likely take vaccine arent necessarily going take republican. likely they're they're rural. Keep also may regional.

That's NY, Republican friends plan taking it, even conspiratorially minded.

Exactly point. red vs. blue, urban vs. rural. theory, think knowing someone died plays role motivating people get vaccinated.

I know would far motivated something protect disease know could kill someone know, also stop spread anyone else.

But biggest thing rural areas far fewer cases urban areas (cities disease factories), people spread means they're less likely get disease already, much less vaccine. Hence, fewer rural people likely get vaccinated.

It's red vs blue, urban vs. rural. That's real divide America. Republicans Democrats define whole parties around it. mom dad doctors (actually half extended family are)

Good them. make assumptions without knowing complete facts.

 literally got called out. 

Care share ""complete evidence""? would course makes sense parents talking general Muslim population (given username) since circulars spread questioning ""Halal"" status vaccine microchips .Similar thing happened 20 years ago Polio vaccination drive.

&amp;#x200B;

A professionals (mostly school university field- less open considered critical point spreading virus- exception Tuscany gave also lawyers judges) given permission get AstraZeneca vaccine, time could subministered people younger 55. 

&amp;#x200B;

At time AstraZeneca used directly save lives, vaccine contain spread general population. hence decided give possibility vaccinating ALSO essential professionals queue system.

&amp;#x200B;

I got vaccine (I'm 30, teaching sector) reason. think February.

&amp;#x200B;

Later on, opened AstraZeneca 65 y/os (maybe higher latest EMA statement, sure), would say vaccination campaign prioritized professionals elderly people, vaccine can't (or couldn't) given old citizens according health regulatory bodies. Tuscany still made strange decision let lawyers despite national directives, judge.

&amp;#x200B;

We could argue AstraZeneca given also elderly citizens, something can't really discuss Reddit, Germany caps 60 y/o countries banned altogether must health concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

I still think priority given also grocery store workers (and similar jobs), age-related cap. I'm glad received vaccine but, honestly, would preferred give sooner parents (who got 60+ couple weeks ago) older essential workers. severe scarcity given focus lives essential categories. introvert gf extrovert. living together stays home mood improve. key introverted people already fun activities weren‚Äôt impacted Covid. ‚ÄúThis community. excuse homeless people ignore black teenagers afraid of‚Äù Tired headlines!!!

You choice go bar COVID-19 clinical update #56, Daniel Griffin notes increasing hospitalization children young adults, Pfizer vaccine efficacy results 12-15 year olds, rapid self administered nucleic acid antigen tests, mRNA vaccine efficacy real world conditions, improvement long COVID vaccination. Trust me, British government going replace AZ Novavax, it‚Äôs going quietly. Sadly yes.... guess that‚Äôs true choose define first wave literally entire pandemic. I‚Äôm sure helpful defining way would be. Lmao doomsday culters hilarious LOL here, flamed quickly job. People fake-clinking beers via webcam....*cringe*.

The first couple months pandemic weird retrospect. So:

-Switzerland, *as today* even producing enough satisfy production despite world-standard facilities set contracts specifically aimed producing domestically exports;

-Canada, *as today* yet managed follow Australia's example build supply chain own, despite EU production faltering quite EU threatening block exports vaccines;

-Australia, would logistical nightmare mass exports;

-the UK, a. prioritizing population supplying others, can't see hypothetical scenario would different EU (or US real life) b. even set *real* domestic supply chain *real life* *only them* without even wanting export still relies EU vaccines they're currently administering even much-touted Novavax's entirely domestic supply chain actually relies components made EU.

The point always same, can't shift production, work like that. lots folks upstate NY travel avoid winter didn‚Äôt get big surge 100% this

In fact, able INCREASE fun activities week COVID-19. mean, they've already thing travelling certain countries.... definitely both.

Old people stay lockdown bit longer, people still working world jobs etc. likely spreaders.

Italy current death trends though *support* (as much trend support something) vision. Italy suffering among 350 500 deaths **daily** (equivalent per capita 1925-2750 US daily deaths). ICUs getting emptied, universities mostly relying distance learning, many schools kept closed (though infants come back soon school). country moving deaths fall hospitals freed.

Italy less 2x mortality (deaths population) USA young population, total higher mortality; guess why--elders.

The vaccinations also administered slow rate build touchable herd immunity young population, explains yet another time country rely lockdowns contain curve lol focus averages mate, saying come Tuesday death count higher lag reporting, condescending.... county seeing highest case numbers since January, yes, hospitalizations up, too.

NHS pretty shit overall comes diagnosing treating illnesses run mill. time funding, shame failing staff well general public though.

All aunts/uncles/spouses (40s-60s) partially fully vaxed. 


Parents (40s-60s) 1 2 doses. 


Siblings 2 eligible fully vaxed. later month. second dose moderna next week. 


The end here. Vaccines open 2 weeks CA, although seems many/most eligible now. county 40% adults least one dose already. restrictions need end May point.

That source anxiety me, sick relatives us really know get vaccine, waiting 6 weeks priority group two appointment. 

It either BioNTech/Pfizer Moderna probably. stopped Astrazeneca 60... I've never understood framework. ""energy"" derive alone people. I'm alone much I'm depressed, I'm people much get stressed. Thanks think proves everyone aware different personality types exist respected.

Sometimes mentally charged enough endure gathering. learn much pandemic, we're willing open ears (and hearts) listen one another.  Im ambivert literally still can't make mind whether like quarantine not.. definitely love/hate thing lol makes sense poorly written headline reflect anything approach vaccine distribution locally. city 1. expanding vaccine distribution due lack supply 2. relaxing restrictions cases going up. two things related headline writer tried conflate beyond me. say safe. going cause huge uproar.

Whatever view merit position seems rather hypocritical talking letting people want businesses want. introverts forced quarantine angry extroverts. Yep 2 dose trial. Confirmed week received 2 doses real deal. Understandable it‚Äôs still minimal risk they‚Äôll need vaccine eventually Partly... agree extroverted affected more. mean lockdowns suck anyone who's introverted.

They suck slightly less. I'm introverted call mood improvement, know source disease pandemic? 
I feel less pressure social though. I'm expected 10 friends laughing party. really feel left out? mean they‚Äôre worth covid. Sorry deal that! Glad you‚Äôre protected might introverted extrovert. enjoy around people like extrovert, still spend energy interactions like introvert.

Like I've shown here, Canada, Australia Switzerland could easily picked manufacturing. need replace entire EU manufacturing, parts exported.

It indeed cheaper manufacture EU export. given EU guaranteed exports would tempered that's manufacturing went.

but export blocked EU earlier comment suggests, EU becomes option export, investment states multinational companies **for export** would shifted EU Switzerland/Canada/Australia UK.

Their experience everyone's covid experience. even worse pandemic, extroverted family also conservative don‚Äôt see COVID much issue still pressuring going dating making friends attending parties they‚Äôre throwing there‚Äôs whole extra layer risk societal pressure that, adds anxiety makes feel much worse time. feel like cannot win matter do. 4.08M, much last Saturday? That's pretty absurd opinion. find oddly interesting people year ago criticized (rightfully so) anti-maskers suddenly turning blind eye towards data science choosing willful ignorance... Im Ontario premier fucking things bad. ""emergency lock down"" means things closed nail salons outdoor patios. Everything else business usual, save 25% capacity. Schools still open. Non-essential retail open. Malls open. ICU numbers never higher. variant quickly lowering average age intubation. Open vaccine appointments one jab. Confusion among get vaccine. God save us. Smacking children common sense good childrearing whole bunch studies proved either useless actively harmful. People even try won‚Äôt major setbacks balance think probably right keep going investigations continue, importance vaccinating whole population.

It looks like benefits outweigh risks, even ta casual link proven. Still nervous when/if wife takes though. Covid-19 still major differences samples. case virus still needed spread mutate (without ever becoming hotspot) Wuhan outbreak; that‚Äôs additional animal considered (or back lab leak scenario) That‚Äôs totally fine want wear mask future, it‚Äôs vastly different requiring everyone so.

The major infringement isn‚Äôt physical act showing passport (though that‚Äôs slightly annoying well), it‚Äôs requirement sharing medical records basic interactions. Yes. Southeastern PA. 4 populous counties around Philadelphia. got less half requested doses initially state officials miscalculated population size. result, rollout parts absolute disaster. issue uneducated people exposed bad information, usually via social media. get convinced vaccines bad minds right thing.

Exactly!! person above, user u/QuitMessingwithme said ""no one said couldn't"" CDC Director said precisely that, later retracted CDC scientific community. 

So people like /u/QuitMessingwithme need stop blabbing narrative head people correcting facts stating data evidence ""freaking out"" furthest truth. ""Enjoy holiday, careful vaccinated yet.""

people ""Enjoy holiday."" Sorry hear dude. Spring right around corner.

I imagine one day you‚Äôll find learned important life lessons year-from-hell. It‚Äôs cruel how, moment, negatives incessant, yet positives lay dormant sometimes years.

After this, even going DMV sounds like thrill Well duh, us introverts finally got break go extroverts time. seems reasonable, cause problem enough get kicked one bar, probably gonna cause problems bars post history suggests American, know think understand people UK currently thinking. government literally briefed people live TV weeks back possibility link AZ blood clots, indication decrease trust vaccine. sound like terrible person around First day 4M vaccinations US yesterday, 7 day average official Science saying vaccinated, going able get virus open up. said I'll say here. 2020 year introvert. 2021 year depression introverts.

Next time think dipshit, maybe don't?  Water wet Exactly, I‚Äôm probably max introvert favorite activities easily completed home alone (video games, reading, catching shows/movies, even hiking prefer alone). Spending 40 hours week office left constantly sapped wanting hide humans weekend. used end work day tension headache days mentally drained, thought nature job. Turns doesn‚Äôt happen I‚Äôve working home. know people carry it? efficacy vaccines 99%. already many many people symptomatic covid post vaccine. uncommon, rare. 

We know sure symptomatic covid post vaccination means people carry covid. stay home anyway. 

Churches open, theaters closed country wait. going even harder people believe sweeps across entire country. beginning. Yeah, idk people thought would change anything. already people/businesses breaking rule mandate lifted.

Basically, everyone wearing mask still wearing one. People want wear one stopped well mandate lifted. I‚Äôm sorry... people tolerance vaccine hesitancy people moment. irony don‚Äôt listen us compassion harder time changing minds. Vaccines still good efficacy mutated strains. depends sequences mutated. gene makes spike protein still (mostly) same, vaccines still work. kidding. scary think alternate time line avoided. support international travel.  ""common flu"" wide variety influenza family viruses, would hard find unique protein attack? remember say 60%. bad either way 30-40%. even want know read p1, can't find discuss. Watch wsj video youtube p1. Doctors treated covid year saying way younger hospitalized. That's need see. foreign countries multinational corporation spent billions cumulative sums back EU promises (that turned lies) hamper vaccine exports. served EU providing jobs domestic manufacturing, bait switch EU trying steal property belong them.

Without explicit EU promises hamper exports, much vaccine manufacturing first place steal brag about. I'm Michigan, county close height pandemic. 

We still mask mandates restrictions reason we're exploding cases hospitalizations. Something worries Michigan testing lot states. states could early stages surge know yet.

We declined lowest country, we're highest. think isolated, think we're among first notice. states even testing half rates be.

Not trying doom gloom, seriously urge caution thinking we're side now. county gets 7 daily cases break record. Yeah no. many countries depend us don‚Äôt‚Äô local production lines get vaccines from. agree AZ doesn‚Äôt play ball sanctioned doesn‚Äôt justify inflicting collateral damage partners allies. remember days, americans made every news article world around themselves? Congratulations, that's now! 

Everybody knows now, EU fucked vaccination campaign, (Germany) crossed 12% first doses today accelerating pace, ""what vaccination"" sensationalist phrasing far detached reality. 

This post actually US, can't happy reaching milestone? great realistically also good us, US vaccination finished, likely next line. stop whining bad situation Germany post improving situation entirely different place. annoying off-topic. Easter bring back?

I'm contradicting anything. I'm simply saying believe Pfizer vaccine eliminate COVID likely mistaken. effective, probably moreso AZ, miracle worker. less, analysis paper really shallow, author show small snippets Sars-CoV-2 proteins similar sequences small bits human proteins, implying antibodies could cross-react. paper never actually showed antibodies people exposed Sars-CoV-2 cross-reactive human proteins cross-reactivity we'd seen autoimmune disorders emerge people infected.

Thank god someone took time research this. waste time all. everyone Reddit keeps pushing perpetual lockdowns. war Japananese absolutely horrific. Nanking, POW treatment etc. 

This fire bomb aimed people trying vaccinate others. I'm saying good firebomb countries brutal war, I'm saying comparison moot. seems highest propensity re-infect individuals

Based ? flawed debunked study guessed 70% covid reality fraction infected? Covid before?

Usually people who've Covid big responses first dose, big responses second. Yup Extrovert here

No shit, expect ? depending country might simular cart, everybody creating own. international standard, might expect green card info yelllow fever one, might well get QR code sends location central server. international standard per country privacy terms might different. vaccine card might privacy proof wont make one so. here. I'm introverted like people I'm seen extroverted people know well. whole thing drag me, I'm good things alone, fun always things alone. anything, would guess opposite. Younger people probably generate stronger immune responses vaccine, older people actually die far higher rates.

(This mean get vaccine young, would guess) 1,610 new cases

This nothing compared population though lol. this. almost everything open. going lessen vaccine numbers grow required social distancing mask wearing (which states already businesses still choose require it). Disney instance stated likely require masks till end 2021. flu respiratory virus cause symptoms respiratory system symptoms. Body aches, fever, vomiting, diarrhea. 

Respiratory virus simply means spread contracted respiratory system. That‚Äôs everyone running around masks on. 

It corona virus. may think is, is. folks responsible identifying virus examined far determined closely related SARS-COV-1. According UK real world data, Pfizer closer 80% effective. one doses 70%, 10% less study done CDC.  Case numbers totally irrelevant. think weather continues warm masks become unpleasant wear, particularly people work outside commute foot bike warmer areas see either outdoor mask mandates rolled back completely ""only social distancing possible"" standard gradually attrition compliance. Hey, name! Based Floridians get arrested sex crimes children? I'm asking questions police didn‚Äôt anything there, support cause. Block away I‚Äôm still going respond. You‚Äôre selfish person selfish attitude doesn‚Äôt allow type communal sacrifice greater good fellow humans, piece cloth paper drape selfish face could potentially save others lives. 

Bravo caveat earlier comment. 90% two four weeks first shot. probably 90% protection right two weeks.

Same argument 70% one week. 

But nevertheless data encouraging. Also sure take consideration incubation period roughly five days. not, might mean noticeable protection begins days first shot. gonna happen. want get control makes comfortable. Multiple aspects pandemic made happier.

1. worry going much.
2. worry getting Covid-19.
3. Less talking people.

But downside spend lot time reading stupid people world stupid things nothing better do. I'm seeing 5M week produced much US. Quite surprising, EU starting ordering late, funding lot, knowing mass production start later massive production problems (looking you, AZ). still, produced much US. 

But consider EU increase production capacity 4 times quarter, compared previous quarter. Deliveries EU go 100 million Q1 420 million Q2. also include lot doses get exported EU well. Using last export use ratio, would around 88 million doses Q1 exported around 368 million doses Q2, assuming ratios stays same. means around 790 million doses produced EU total Q2 means around 980 million doses produced EU first 6 months year. 

For Q3 production even set increase another 70% compared Q2. might mean 1.34 billion doses produced EU third quarter alone. 2.32 billion doses total first 9 months year. eventual goal produce 3 billion doses EU 2021 (which seems reasonable, looks like deliveries reduce Q4 again, around 1 billion doses produced).

These accurate numbers whatsoever, based current export use ratios deliveries Q3 still quite unsure, show kind number EU set produce coming months.

But even numbers off, better worse, surely exciting time ahead. Please don‚Äôt get wrong. vaccine proven safe multiple time. I‚Äôd take heartbeat (I initially bit hesitant speculating bad batch reason discrepancy UK numbers EU numbers - seems like numbers getting similar)

My point is; quickly give one subgroup people (eg women aged 18-55) different vaccine mean lower risk CVST coagulation disorder - least consider it. might stupid article make sense me. literally say one thing one paragraph contradict next. missing something? mean say saying, right says stay 6 feet apart wear masks despite vaccine. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

And won‚Äôt ever start commenting AZ cited ‚Äúup 90%‚Äù press release. saw went.  know 7 day average last Saturday?  I'm hoping soreness arm. I'd say worth side effects much lower (the vaccine takes lot longer work).

Isn't main advantage J&amp;J works faster? 14 days shot good go

I'd fine shot, took one could get first literally participate fear mongering. babe felt hope first time long time getting first shot. sure I'll feel getting second. I'll probably cry, I'll probably order pizza celebrate. 

I think I'm going cry tears happiness everybody immediate family vaccinated. relatives gotten least one shot point. I've also affected negatively someone diagnosed social anxiety disorder avoidant personality disorder. also live place barely restricted due low amount cases I'm nowhere near badly affected. lock days, even though socialise, feel trapped freedom go places would let steam like gym eating out. can't even imagine living place longterm lockdown.  living alone is. Try introverted three extrovert kids extrovert partner. Absolute nightmare.  true didnt even think yeah train people administer them. Yeah, best friend introverts pandemic hit us really hard. first sounded great going small amount social interaction week worked almost nothing actually fucked mental health. Hopefully last week last peak! Super excited summer sucks. think scared happening close finish line.

Vaccine passports unequal sharing blessings. 

No vaccine passports equal sharing misery. 

My opinion need prepare vaccine passports roll out. June, we‚Äôll find stand vaccine uptake. enough people gotten board train deaths fall manageable levels without social distancing precautions, well. But, suspect, can‚Äôt get deaths low enough without social distancing, vaccine passports solution allow responsible members society stuff without social distancing. also act stick everybody else get shot.  works much slower. curves diverge day 11 mRNA vaccine, day 16 J&amp;J. main advantage J&amp;J uses completely different supply chain. call real pants ‚Äúhard pants.‚Äù offense herd immunity **not** concern young people turns way get poses similar risk. vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop getting virus, stops getting bad case

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Introverted. true. 

I account 6,999,999,999 people world, experience says true. hardest part people encouraged go outside...excuse me, that's I'm want around people 6 months definitely saw improvement. days, feel like I'm nearing new low. What's opinion 2 British factories built EU's funding?

[Two officials said EU‚Äôs contract committed paying 336 million euros \($406 million\) AstraZeneca, mostly finance production vaccines four named factories. Two these, run Oxford Biomedica Cobra Biologics, Britain, others Germany Belgium. ‚ÄúPart money went UK,‚Äù one officials care others do? vaccinated, doesn‚Äôt matter entire bar Covid positive. get us mess faster. security theater point fully vaccinated. think good role model.

I don‚Äôt think ask young people, yet eligible vaccination sacrificed lot protect older people, continue wear masks socially distance seeing older vaccinated people running around so.

I plan keep cautious simply respect younger folks. (And seen pics irresponsible people spring break, lot young folks acted responsibly throughout pandemic proud them.) Yeah, basically. works.

Even end day dont care something particular, there's always ""what if"" question comes play participating. type long term testing think done vaccines?  talking observations vast vast majority vaccine side effects instant-within 3 months. 

As ones approved trial phases complete would ijtrial.  difference EUA traditional approval/licensing trials bunch stuff quality control, batch sampling, inspections, stuff like that.  

It‚Äôs actually much different place currently it‚Äôs basically saying ‚Äúno don‚Äôt send batch sample another organization examine wait release batch‚Äù.  seems like companies stuff house pretty well.  Heck J&amp;J caught huge embarrassing error instantly went public actually adds confidence instead erodes think logically. know people recommended clear ID badge holders keep CDC vaccine cards protected ‚Äî anyone particular suggestions cheapest ones fit card and/or solutions? I've done preliminary search standard ones small card. fucking what?

What matter originated, long identify variant we're talking about?

It's pointless, 'UK variant' offensive could change name. 

How 'brexit variant' sound? embarrassing. I've spent last 4 years combating people scream ""fake news"" many media outlets decided want report honestly impending ""end"" Covid crisis US. wonder people turn lunatics YouTube information. 

We're year this. Time report honestly already instead twisting every bit good news bad news Lol everyone side effects. didn‚Äôt any.
Well maybe bit tired second one week anyway already exhausted work.

But Pfizer didn‚Äôt get cramps/pain/etc others reported. 

Arm didn‚Äôt hurt much either. You‚Äôre acting like everyone knew POC communities. Sounds like you‚Äôre projecting ‚Äúwhite people hate POC‚Äù narrative something nothing race.

For example, forwarded text couple friends last month extra doses Oakland going waste entered ‚ÄúOAKLAND3A5‚Äù myturn (CAs vaccine scheduling website), would automatically let make appointment. 

How fuck people supposed know code POC communities? search code online nothing comes up. California also said nothing beforehand specifically giving codes underprivileged communities could skip line. 

It wasn‚Äôt week code deactivated say code underprivileged community abused. took one person community spread code start avalanche everyone telling friends. population US mainly white such, white people large ones using code spreading (as common sense would dictate), mean white people intentionally trying steal vaccines POC.

Take anti-white hate here, stop blaming everything race. I‚Äôve literally unaffected Covid. It‚Äôs actually one successful years life. I‚Äôve missed attending odd concert sports event literally anything else I‚Äôm interested I‚Äôve able do. me! Mood increase! Show evidence last sentence. current evidence currently indicating opposite true.

How spread virus don‚Äôt have? think must depend live kind people hang out. definitely people aren‚Äôt sports like that. allergic rxns something called reactogenicity, occur variety reasons. It‚Äôs anti-inflammatory response, it‚Äôs noted people severe reaction like infected Covid prior vaccine, body already antibodies starts trying beat hell spike proteins formed. There‚Äôs TON that

Agreed. taking walk day two people walking towards side walk immediately double masked within 10 feet darted side road. March 2020 vibes honestly stupid hell. foolishness. wait bit. dumbest thing happening right easing restrictions cases rising vaccinations still nowhere near enough give plausibility return semi-normal.

America short logic long personal irresponsibility. Seriously. I'll take chances AZ. Hopefully studies ‚Äúcome online‚Äù sooner rather later, people well behind curve understanding this. still legions people saying ‚ÄúThe vaccine reduces severity illness, doesn‚Äôt prevent infection spread.‚Äù feel like head gonna explode read many those. [TLDR: can‚Äôt drive out, fly, sail, take non-commuter train technically, seeking medical treatment considered essential travel. Idk excuse would pass muster customs, though. introvert shy burden corona (still counting) 550k+ lockdowns masks. take corona driven numbers without restrictions. resurface summer unless 70%ish vaccinated including kids.  People know anything know ""mask good. Varient scary. Fauci god."" articles appeal kinds people thing. pretty incredible! I‚Äôd love try read something vaccine hesitancy many people eventually get vaccinated, might little soon attempt I‚Äôm sure much I‚Äôd trust guesses. must say like idea ANYONE (business, government, mother-in-law, etc.) demanding see health data precondition providing access service. That's big step slippery slope... mine yet, do, do, I'm asked show proof vaccination entering private business, gladly comply. win internet today. Thank links!! Omg love this. Shut dude trying save throwing literal fire bombs people


choose one vaccinated, would care? stick together overcome government That‚Äôs almost Croatia, including second jab. Croatia behind schedule, yeah, would make dent. 

It‚Äôs also almost enough Ireland (plus second shot), Latvia&amp;Lithuania (plus second jab two countries also behind schedule). Im one people loving it.

Its nice white lie way day. ‚ÄúSo excited here.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood see you..‚Äù ‚ÄúYes make plans that.‚Äù smiling fake laughing dumb jokes boring conversation. 

My conscious feels cleaner. mind clear anxiety low even despite virus.

Sleeping still weird though. Im moving much usual sleep especially deep covid shaky. CDC credible source you? Oh.

I must ignored word combination. bad. important news? dolly state gov now? Great news indeed! Unfortunately, potential increase supply could exponential, increase infrastructure required, including staff administer initial secondary booster immunization doses, would grow equal rate. would serve controlling factor. Hopefully think out-of-the-box solutions, including assistance outside resources. Particularly 'UK' variant clearly originate UK, first detected UK thanks UK's testing regime.

Like, way grateful... there's definitely lot people calling introverted when, fact, sounds like they've got social anxiety.

I wish read comment typed lol stated exact same. stated comment I'm true introvert( misanthrope) business usually me. 

If anything I'm getting social anxiety depression thought going back normal routine. That‚Äôs super dumb system. got first shot Meijer, automatically booked second appointment first appointment.  bet Japan fared well cause wear masks without maddening political debates *actually* social distance, Americans pretend do. Insulted nature young, healthy 20 year old, respectfully disagree. 

My risk dying even severe covid near zero I‚Äôve well accepted year worth data prove that. personally comfortable without vaccine all. I‚Äôm going get one, I‚Äôm going settle J&amp;J.  AstraZeneca vaccine shown significantly less effective South African variant, that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm NJ we‚Äôre still like nine days away April 12th, spike predicted peak start going down. 

My grandmother also second dose Monday, two three at-risk people family would vaccinated. I‚Äôm looking forward able calm little bit worry one us giving Covid. think bit weird don‚Äôt mention ages/gender cases. report ages virus deaths every day meticulously. feels like choice objective science. people problem ‚Äúpassports‚Äù automatically equated anti-vaxxer. little discourse happening proposed regulations they‚Äôre shut label. That's take this?

I mean really.

Ebola spread fluid contact. can't imagine someone COMBINATION TUBERCULOSIS EBOLA might spread fluids droplet spread bloody infected fluids expelled via coughing. Top comments... introverts. applaud owning space. I'm real happy guys. 

But extroverts ready slit goddamn wrists. Apparently plant Belgium produce +100M/month, one VP's claimed article Belgian news feel like minority I'm true introvert ( also bit misanthrope) forced shutdown affect activities all. anything mood improved nice put social face everyday.

It's interesting read many ""introverts"" depressed, strongly believe people get introverts social anxiety/shyness confused. states, opened lot people once, meaning highest risk fighting lower risk available vaccines. continued open phases current open phases still difficulty scheduled vaccines. state/area, vaccine appointments still booked solid 4 weeks everyone open category fighting (sometimes actually fighting stores) get vaccinated. None correct. J J effective variants. effective, still protects severe disease death 2020 best year life. Plus canceling/declining got much easier. sudden feeling 100% valid excuse cancel anything. country star international treasure posted photos getting shot Friday Twitter. thanked staff Vanderbilt University Medical Center wrote, ""Dolly gets (second) dose medicine."" Monday, Tennessee open vaccine eligibility state residents age 16. biggest change me. endless chain errands every weekend, shopping trips bored, family dinners eat entire day two. kind nice every moment free time claimed someone. It‚Äôs really hard, need put little effort. health departments didn‚Äôt get enough vaccine there‚Äôs plenty pharmacies, especially you‚Äôre willing drive hour. Look pharmacy websites midnight, you‚Äôll find something. Ebola airborn. Heck, forgot Dutch plant produced vaccines UK recently applied EMA approval produce EU. 

That plant already mentioned contract produce EU.

China balls. big reason people congregate indoors- going massive issue point debate restriction effectiveness- everything closed people need stay home families.

This common sense epidemiology stuff. People largely get sick winter crowd inside families. close museums, movies, zoos, parks, playgrounds, tell people dangerous go outside issue months long stay home orders, creating **ideal** scenario transmission within households.

There's going debate whether restrictions worth prevent transmission virus, likely continue long live, there's going second debate whether restrictions went actually made things worse. going pretty huge deal data comes told bad idea, kind damage really never go away, within living memory.

Im talking restrictions countries placing international travel. Nothing US that. Almost science-deniers dying others.

......I ONE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!

So thankful finally able get jab wonderful people helped make happen. 

If haven‚Äôt able get one yet, hope able soon! Follow local subreddits, journalists Twitter, etc., it‚Äôs helped many people know connect open appointments. Welp aren‚Äôt ‚Äútesting it‚Äù people phased trials ‚Äútesting it‚Äù.  

Let‚Äôs say 1 3 things happen 

1- never get Covid 

2- get vaccine body produces signature spike protein chops recognizes it‚Äôs confronted Covid doesn‚Äôt let replicate 

3- get natural infection Covid body produces spike protein attached actively replicating Covid whatever does

I can‚Äôt really put thumb proposed long term effects people worried vaccines. Like pathology, mechanism, category?

I say wild type Covid way mystery mRNA vaccine.  multi system inflammatory phase acute infection weird even young people stuff find atypical. lingering fatigue find patients strange sometimes persistent loss change taste and/or smell really crazy. 

Post 1918 pandemic 2 decades Parallel pandemic mysterious condition Encephalitis Lethargia unknown cause hard pinpoint even spreading everywhere. mild cases turned people catatonic zombies would eventually collected nursinghome-like wards grew lived 60s believe. movie Awakenings one doctor able wake months new drug. Encephalitis lethargia medical mystery years speculation whether syndrome linked world huge % people gotten recovered Spanish flu.  It‚Äôs conjecture work studying handful archived brain tissue samples Encephalitislethargia patients unable find RNA flu.  still persists potent hypothesis origins. 

My point virtually everyone worried long term effects vaccines dismisses possible longterm impacts incubating random bat virus managed make way lives roughly 20% humans little year.

We 103.5m Americans first dose right now. averaging 1.78M first doses/day. There‚Äôs 27 days left April. current pace, would additional 48M first doses. 

So shouldn‚Äôt end April number 151M 110.7M? here, textboook introvert, enjoy select groups parties, love things alone sometimes. 

But disgrace user gloating ""mandatory separation"" literally trying put introvert label top it. spread virus don‚Äôt have?

The vaccine prevents *disease* (COVID-19), *virus* (SARS-CoV-2). virus still enter body like before, spread virus like before.

After taking vaccine, body simply better training fighting virus. means virus lower chances creating disease.

Furthermore, vaccine prevents *serious case* disease. still get ""sniffle-flu"" type disease.

Man, really going miss see extended family holidays *le sigh* What‚Äôs pic, John Candy dead since like 1992 paradise cto see deal people. respect awesome obviously worth took position. must hard you, never driving car crossing road pedestrian thought hit milestone week ago. anyone clarify? 100 million doses administered (including 2nd doses)? assuming 1% women get infected. true, keep community spread down, means severe border controls and/or lockdowns (depending country) need continue forever. think that's viable. Eventually countries like Australia open world, virus get in, without vaccinations everyone get infected. words, think vaccination long-term solution. Lockdowns border controls much economic damage.

I also think 20 deadly clot cases per million people high. UK we've 7 deaths, believe around 3 million younger people. that's order magnitude lower fatality rate clotting. (We've cases, think there's tendency confuse cases fatalities.)

Finally, believe relatively easy reduce fatality rate clotting. symptoms known, treatment known, need vigilant.  got first dose 30th. 2nd scheduled. believe Marburg play produces EU beforehand Pfizer pumping 13m doses per week US, significantly EU. think going go away. headache, cough, tickle throat probably seen somewhat serious years, guess. also Pfizer self producing AstraZenica due Europe blocking exports. US UK exporting vaccinations, EU is. EU negotiated time ""good"" deal vaccinations bleeding vaccinations due corporations going market tells go, despite entirely code. There's also issue corporations producing EU fact majorly UK/US owned funded, producing markets often resources US UK mixed all. bit complex sides got leg stand on.

The EU thinking taking measures keep resources within borders rather letting bleed regions, similar UK US doing. uncommon practice times crisis prohibit export regionally produced resources, usually goes crisis global. neighboring country lacking food are, makes sense prohibit export foodstuffs. bit different everyone suffering shortage goods produced conjoint global effort. 

So bound sour UK EU relations UK claims hoarding vaccinations whereas EU collectively saying do. EU perspective, selfish approach research towards vaccinations global effort, even though fair say UK major contributor. Meanwhile, people UK happy taken care off. 

So international relations Europe traditional allies going hitting absolute low, UK politicians nationally likely heavily benefit approach. see lot redditors praising respective government here, think relationships countries - specifically European ones - unfortunately turn extremely bitter wake trauma. 16 hours past Pfizer first dose

Shot relatively painless far shots go - I‚Äôve much worse. 6 hours post, felt little crappy got chills - temp dropped 96s. Slept off, woke morning feeling fine exception sore shoulder that‚Äôs pretty similar heavy arm workout.

Pleased lack side effects far US' current vaccination drive, think reason believe life mostly returned normal September, including schools. Looking Israel's case trend despite third population 18, entirely likely COVID-19 go towards near eradication even children unvaccinated. *Michigan entered chat* Right. special circumstance felt kind pushed (not pleased). hadn‚Äôt seen since Christmas 2019 even though live hour away, covid. typical non-believers. rules place outside wearing masks followed well two young children don‚Äôt understand general complete fail attempting see safely I‚Äôm bit nervous it. convinced FIL get vaccine MIL bought apprehension. It‚Äôs causing lot tension - family dynamics strained days. say one time thing sort pushed us lots boundaries crossed. curious studies death/hospitalization 1st dose. one arguing that. trying explain responsible states, like Michigan, seem currently issues stats like Texas having. told sub 2 weeks would ""bodies laying streets Florida"" probably thousand times past year. Also known end cold flu season. assuming article talking 0-34 range? 

They aren‚Äôt, referring data. that‚Äôs they‚Äôre hoping *you* think read headline. 

When hear ‚Äúyoung people‚Äù, 59 year old retirees pop head? think bunch 21 year old college students? say ‚Äúwell *of course* think 59 year olds, that‚Äôs plenty young‚Äù - you‚Äôre lying yourself. 

I understand going on. There‚Äôs increased risk 50-80 unvaccinated. *come on*. headlines statements Tam &amp; DeVilla ‚Äúhow increased threat *young people*‚Äù supposed make believe actual threat people 0-34. According data shared - **there isn‚Äôt**. don‚Äôt like new CDC director. didn‚Äôt like last one either, didn‚Äôt surprise given President time. really thought better person would appointed. 

Between ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared‚Äù idea vaccinated people cannot get virus spread virus think she‚Äôs either little looney perhaps bad communicator. Maybe gets nervous, don‚Äôt know. Seems CDC professional spokesperson handle consistent, clear, calm communication. isn't, look asymptomatic presymptomatic flu infections like COVID-19. assuming article talking 0-34 range? 

They aren‚Äôt, referring data. that‚Äôs they‚Äôre hoping *you* think read headline. 

When hear ‚Äúyoung people‚Äù, 59 year old retirees pop head? think bunch 21 year old college students? say ‚Äúwell *of course* think 59 year olds, that‚Äôs plenty young‚Äù - you‚Äôre lying yourself.

According data shared - **there isn‚Äôt**. Masks mandated pretty much everywhere yet wave wave. country successfully fended first wave without single mask. things game changers focus point. common sense things like staying home symptoms, stay home tested positive (not done ton) massive gatherings every day without voluntary quarantine/work home next days meeting old people after. 

Masks like tenth thing need focus on. People refuse vaccine astra zeneca.

Nobody obligated risk life doesnt matter small risk is. Yeah. India 4 times population US. level US need closer 10mil mark. Ofcourse easier said done i‚Äôve heard parents family back India half population super reluctant get shot would rather ‚Äúride out‚Äù take vaccine. That‚Äôs sadly true vaccines general India. I'm history teacher talk class time bad things lead innovations. Michigander dude. fucking sub become circlejerk strictly positive covid news.

Fact michigan tests wildly states country. live grand traverse county, highest vaccination rate state, stone's throw away breaking covid case record. Michigan gathering restrictions, mask mandate, restaurant capacity limits still happening.

Ohio even hitting half testing goals, texas hitting quarter l, states hitting half, Michigan exceeding. Many states surging, know yet. hospitalizations spike ina week two they'll find then.

Everyone sub wants pretend over, Michigan absolutely testament not. people living states without covid restrictions absolutely concerned. similar experience. got JnJ well, within 12 hours getting shot hit awful side effects. Fever, chills, body aches shakes, awful headache, etc. Even ran 102 fever night. side effects subsided 10am next day, roughly 24 hours shot. body fatigued barely moved second day. felt energetic wanted move, body wasn‚Äôt it. day 3, felt even better still wasn‚Äôt feeling capable anything light housework. 

It‚Äôs weird side effects vary person. know people got JnJ never one side effect aside sore arm. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  7 people died taking vaccine 1000 people day dying vaccine clear vaccine nowhere near dangerous individual.

Why people upvote shit. UK recording lowest deaths months vaccine program. vaccine causing deaths yes course needs addressing saying lives 10,000s surely. ID drive Chipotle. root don‚Äôt let guard soon. Exponential growth hard outrun. problem we‚Äôve seen putting ‚Äúthe public‚Äôs interest‚Äù / ‚Äúthe greater good‚Äù first taken regulators justification mislead public, e.g. message Americans stupid keep touching masks masks weren‚Äôt helpful anyway really trying preserve mask supplies medical settings.

In case, data Europeans seems indicate younger females risk, UK doesn‚Äôt seem releasing age sex CVST patients. raises suspicion hiding risks one demographic order achieve better outcome population large. Link please? I‚Äôm still 20 minutes ago Reddit karma got shit lol. Listen. I‚Äôm trying argue. want facts.  stating fact. Neanderthals science governors rolling back mask mandates acting science thusly like Neanderthal. fact need explain telling btw. I'd interested see defines ""overwhelming"" majority. going weeks hit majority adults receiving least one dose. surprised get 70% initiating May. what's Fauci's number? include children? I'm happy he's starting speak mask mandates realistic way I'd appreciate information. Obviously lot subject change get information, we're expected get vaccine country we're entitled know implications they're presently understood. Florida least incredibly easy get vaccine rural areas. think lack access. think communities hit hard urban population centers residents may see need vaccine, especially they're impression ""just flu"". Two coworkers tested positive covid week. went got rapid test came back negative, started develop fever soon test. past 24 hours temperature went 102.5, barely slept, nauseous, splitting headache, moved bed 24 hours... took nap morning fever broke, headache mostly gone, feel almost fine.

I'm really seeing anybody say virus experience went, really hope truly over, awful 24 hours.  Lets get 80%!!! People keep making similar comments think this:  side effects? ""plethora excellent vaccines"" available UK. two vaccines guarantee consistent supply AZ Novavax, later rolled May earliest, maybe even June. know feeling elation, especially realize family protected remaining duration pandemic. RNA may slightl superior technology comes symptoms asymptomatic case

If term categorize this. Dare say term? Perhaps ... ""efficacy""?? Asymptomatic pre-symptomatic two different things. people spread SARS-2 develop symptoms, remain asymptomatic. much protection one dose moderna give you? Whitmer caved wants get re-elected sponsorship corporate backers. Republicans never going ever help anything, prioritizing political future people‚Äôs lives put us recent surge case. Michigan Supreme Court controlled Democrats would‚Äôve backed chosen take action. Yeah using exclamation makes ambiguous. meant latter. obscure Simpsons reference. Lol got Pfizer shots I‚Äôm fan vaccine passports. I‚Äôd rather focus getting vaccination everyone wants one. that, doesn‚Äôt really matter everyone choice protect themselves. I‚Äôm trouble finding apolitical news site link that‚Äôs allowed sub guidelines google ‚ÄúCDC walks back guidelines‚Äù probably find info it. wish countries extracted available doses AZ vaccine vials information anyone find (should common knowledge now) need masks majority vaccinated. control state mandates cannot give nationwide mask mandate. relation state mandates ask governors local officials so, doing.  


Stop trying make someone look incompetent actions governed rules, best make things go forward. think information go google type ""when safe wear masks"" answers beyond counting. verifiable sources agree. lack information giving (their ads every medium media tv, youtube, google, facebook, reddit everywhere) lack using brain type 8 words google. sounds like get adjusted normal life. may take time. finally open economy summer? like Brexit gonna hate Brentry. amount people think present ID bar it‚Äôs therefore acceptable require vaccine passport really fucking sad. got mine yesterday even though I'm unemployed (mostly Covid) I'm tired spending 98% time home wife would happy house then. least protection feel safe-ish mask instead hermit. Well easy get vaccine Texas mostly everyone died mask mandate lifted weeks ago. /s agree. know single ""extrovert"" comes home events parties need recharge bit. asked people classify introverts, they'd include 90% population. don‚Äôt miss restaurants, coffee shops, book stores, travel?

I don‚Äôt really need socialize people outside family want things home. like home time time.

I whole list restaurants want visit getting vaccinated. literally left monitoring period vax"
