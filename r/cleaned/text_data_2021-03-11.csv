0,2021-03-11,"  I’m thinking he’s he’s overly cautious. knows states open vaccines time April, many quasi open Alaska already is. 


No reason Memorial Day can’t normal, shoot even cinco de Mayo many areas. sad part that, completely possible vaccine doses sit unused expire US gets shit together. Oh mention sheer number anti-vax idiots waste even time. 

So senseless selfish. least send vaccines place they'll appreciated used. Agreed. Taken context; click bait Possibly. Depends find trials. Even everyone able get fall. Logistically everything set go, exactly getting yearly flu shot across country. fact might able get flu shot covid booster time. Phizer’s approved Brazil don’t supply Yeah hopefully administration doesn’t lag vax rates One night stand occurrences go 1000% baseline single people potentially fucking entire year. Eh. less effective normal blood thinners. effect. Around 40% iirc. Better nothing.

That's advise take superficial blood clots. wish bruh. Sad Might take time reacclimate you’ll get there. Gonna odd culture shock culture, lol That’s awesome. US share finished vaccinating Americans. vaccines used, it’s like US sit wearhouses. That's 20x Norway's population... Yeah, I've years worth time. I'm rather sick me. Whatever comfortable with. worth, CDC says okay vaccinated people spend time unvaccinated people without precautions. Chinese wet markets exotic animals shit conditions. randy fucked bat Mayer shocked well meshed band. One last shows saw lock  56% good news. crazy hope vaccines would retain really high effectiveness across strains. funny feel like presented pretty objective way. totally realize wages need increase, said this.

I'm saying someone LITERALLY TALKS hiring managers every day, U.S. Warehouse, manufacturing, anything right around min wage little above. can't find people willing work.

There FUCK TON jobs right now, people content making making unemployment. can't find job right simply looking. fucking relief. He’s close perfect anything, god improvement. in-laws we’ve mostly avoided last year. pretty pissed recently got angry barrage drunken texts FIL something something you’re stupid don’t go church die completely unrelated shit covid allowed son see one weekend went pick second learned decided bbq invite every Jim Bob Joann over. leave California, back. Already. Biden can’t “direct” states anything.

At could threaten withhold vaccine don’t, can’t see that! uhhh tell lies? wut?  sit one buddy talk school district? They’re still talking hybrid fall 😤 Happiest birthdays you. question: 

my guy friend fully vaccinated coming hangout, hand vaccinated dont really leave house much. mom also fully vaccinated, make wear mask hangout house? Well vaccine hurt like hell I'm *pretty* sure real thing I've cautiously optimistic able travel see friends summer! I'm schedule two small conventions August right they're also cautiously optimistic going ahead scheduled.  Im 15 count? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 🦀🦀🦀 COVID (almost) gone 🦀🦀🦀 Texas won’t that. don’t cotton well Federal government wants do. signed vaccine January. Still waiting first shot. diagnosed COVID-19 week. wish could got shot this. would assume would severe?

Not trying jerk, asking curiosity. Lol think that’s regards relaxation. Love comfortable bubble. glad I’m birth control, shit bout lit 🔥 Eligible key word  plan commit tax fraud? Hell yeah. Cubs talking 20% start well. Honestly seeing fans seats spring training games brings smile face totally agree! Booked DJ recently hopes dance party. Feels good excited again. Hope incredible well! We've family it, know we've it. in-laws never stopped going bars, casinos, restaurants large gatherings. fucked start. ain't using there??? That’s dedication right there. power you. able see soon, months hopefully. Definitely summer Don’t wait... haven’t even started trials yet age group. I’m sure feel. Anxiously excited everything going back “normal” anxious general. I’ve definitely dipped mental health past year alone, also found growing creating new goals. much wanna party enjoy festivals, think it’ll take time get used idea huge crowd. I’m happily vaccinated there’s something still feels uneasy mingling others. guess time tell. I’ve also enjoyed working home dread idea returning back work, plus traffic. 

I also want say heart goes lost friend and/or family member virus. covid vaccines would exceptional anything.

No wouldn’t. Sure, vaccines actually make clinic mostly impact transmission. literature rife studies vaccine candidates don’t prevent viral shedding animal models. Il honest Im really interested debating this. 

First find clinical trial demonstrating one dose AZ’s vaccine effective one dose Janssens please link if. Please link Ramasamy study well, I’d like read 

Second, can’t draw comparisons data accumulated post trial general population versus clinical trial. somewhat important factor condition clinical trials see drug fail general population (for variety reasons) succeeded clinical trials that’s basis drugs pulled market. So...that conclusive controlled data AZ’s vaccine 62.5% effective, comparing data vaccines clinical trial environment. using AZ’s real world data sort double standard. conclude AZ performance demonstrably worse environment used test vaccines.

Now, extremely encouraging it’s real world performance among general population robust. don’t want dismiss significance that. I’m wary using compare vaccines. we’re seeing even Pfizer’s vaccine appears perform somewhat better among general population data Israel believed.  

So basis estimating mRNA vaccine efficacy strictly based upon clinical trial data provides us relatable controlled environment. 

Concerning study South Africa agree suspect, also believe (given clinical trial data) AZ’s vaccine likely among least effective environment B.135 dominant. think extremely premature irresponsible South African government sell they’re AZ supply. held data gathered.

So conclude interesting conversation I’m always pleased engage another scientist. basis discussion Im using different set parameters making assertions, ones believe provide greater degree comparability. don’t see either us convinced since you’re using less uncontrolled data still gathered basis, may actually show positive result clinical trials (in-fact I’m inclined think will) dont believe adequate comparison

Also I’m entirely sure you’re arguing, mRNA’s vaccines in-fact fail B.135? Lab data support this, pretty sure said expect decent amount efficacy retained people anything go back Applebee's, measured response based reality sadly welcome.  Wooo, I'm grocery store worker got first dose! That's :D Biden authority let anyone anything!

These state responsibilities! Hopefully faster viral mutations. VaRiAnTs SaY hELLo Eligible 16/17 year olds get Pfizer right want Uh ok lol Probably *Fingers crossed Belgium, want Cantillon* kids’ school district said logistically hard bring back remote learning academic year. Hybrid kids may person April, fully remote stay home June. in-laws followed ""Corona virus liberal hoax"" crowd beginning family never chance avoid it. know I've caught times I've tested I've come back negative. want really want vaccinate time kids there's side effects go together. Thanks fam Amazing!! Congratulations enjoy every minute leading it! Planning finally feels fun again! first dose arm literally felt like broken. bizarre hurt bad. trouble sleeping even, anytime moved winced pain. weird. Whatever. masks easily least painful sacrifice make. Don’t know you’re downvoted. factual response. idea South African variant hold vaccination. Procede caution! here. soon vaccination fully kicks I'm going hitting bars! literally based 2019/2020 get paid year. What's problem statement? mean like team people company makes prospect week long events loathsome.

I need listen dudebro Dan talk bad ass time got fight girlfriend's ex. (actual story guy made us listen to) Mine June 18th! I’ve crying tears joy weeks now. almost postponed mid-February decided go ahead happy decision. CDC guidance notoriously cautious. According CDC supposed 2 standard drinks day (1 female), eat runny eggs rare steak, must wear sunscreen anytime step outside house. Highly likely states allow beyond federal guidelines recommend. Yes shhhhhh silence truth. I'll probably delete comment later deniers actual reality covid coming back weeks!!!!!!! fair made promise 1m day, fact, first mention found december 8th, ambitious time K E pharmacist. patient contact every day. would irresponsible hypocritical get it. shhhhhhhhhh Oh, one? cautious say promise.

As Fauci said quite long time ago, ""If looks like overreacting, probably right thing.""

Most likely everything reevaluated end month, end April, end May end June.

Most likely June vaccines available everyone chance get shots.

Fully expect end May, things quite normal.

Large gatherings going little tough organizations companies, everyone going want take precautions ones potentially creating spreader event. might come till fall. Hope get approved US soon also. You’re really confidently wrong 😂 56% isn’t good news? many news headlines much Reddit warped perception, that’s excellent number, well effective. Take week off, you’re going crazy. salary :) Thanks, random stranger, telling irrational I'm upset postpone 100+ person wedding sinking non-refundable money it. Clearly I'm upset small gatherings -- basic reading comprehension given away -- inability host large gatherings literally illegal live.

But again, thanks 0.02. 🙄 Okay that's calming haha. Thank you! interesting see masks longer \*allowed\* public places... we'll know over. Wait Brazilian variant that's resistant vaccines comes 100% get political, current administration sandbagging hard. ""100M vaccinations 100 days"" goal silly jump, already vaccinating million people daily took office. Purposefully setting expectations low knock park one thing, expectations set unrealistically low there's way can't reach them, end looking either pessimistic foolish Well least Pfizer’s real world data appears strongly contradict claimed Pfizer’s vaccine would similar efficacy J&amp;J tested context variants.

Although, there’s lot talk efficacy measures different. J&amp;J allegedly effective longer period time, someone told definition “mild” case different? day year ago canceled huge work event things starting look bad. fly people country kick one largest Cloud migration projects organization ever undertaken. getting clear guidance leadership, made call week management going moral weight someone getting sick conscious.

Professionally year kicked ass. Raises, pulled Cloud project, team miss beat. Work home forced us put place lot technology made us even efficient productive. I've never prouder great team professionals. super concerned productive been. think lot people bored thrown work ""performing"" well, feel like entire team burning out. hope things start opening back (safely) take much needed breaks.

Personally year sucked ass. relationship end February 2018 decided I'd take year off, work myself, save house, start meeting people March 2019. COVID kinda blew hole lot that. housing market went nuts, therapist became overwhelmed retired, routines used keep happy like gym peopling work got blown hell. anxiety going even store May/June became overwhelming. take mini vacation August exhausted burned everything.

Slowly gotten better. bought AMAZING house, little projects keep busy, got new therapist, since get second dose tomorrow I'm going back gym next week. Hell I'm 80 pounds, pandemic helped take last 20. might lost year life, many people lost entire lives. I'm grateful position right now. Someday months go try make new friends, hang old friends, meet people try fall love. least hope now. I'm going convention towards end year said they'll hold person con year trade masks required, raves dance competition year hopefully changes opinion don’t see mask mandates anywhere US 2022. fall. guess months eligible kids eligible I'd get soon can. least reduce risk kids get you. Oh we'll see Lol😂

Admittedly they're food good! don’t like Biden all. know Trump couldn’t even deliver information coherent way. Biden low bar set succeed cleared letting us know what’s going on. mine!! I’m saying would solved pandemic man?  fall dealing factious disease whew. know Damn. That’s awesome. Believing certain functions may open precovid form certain point shut advocating enjoying functions closed. 

Case point, weeks ago Pax East subreddit thread people thought convention going canceled June. Coronavirus subreddit would believe they’re social distancing loving introverts want pandemic go forever. guys, everybody crushed depressed that, understanding, wouldn’t local conventions attend. I'm wondering we'll see lower 95% effectiveness vaccinated stop social distancing wearing masks. It’ll still take time everyone actually get it. summer way less restrictions everything goes according plan likely Covid undiagnosed then. Body already primed fight it, making feel like shit first time still engaged time second shot came  It’s crazy thread done complete 180. anyone says “hey let’s ease back normal” treated like doomsday prepper. majority opinion seems “covid over! Burn masks!” definitely missteps PA. Well, can't mix match doses, right? least Canada, there's four-month waiting period doses 1 2, got first Pfizer dose June, need get second Pfizer shot October. hope so. girlfriend unable see other. I’ve eyeballing every slight availability vaccines weeks (even though don’t qualify) hopes vaccinated peoples could travel. time last year keeping track numbers country (Scotland) spreadsheet, seeing situation developing. sharing reddit, someone suggested make website it, decided do. (a year ago today probably working building it, first time shared 14th)

Anyways, fast forward year website still going on, eating 3-4 hours day every single day. 15 million views, mentioned leaders country, even national newspapers. link anyone interested)

It's really cool sense never thought I'd achieve anything like this, Im fed now. want go back lazy, visit family again, go travel again. even want McDonalds again.. there's none near travelling get one illegal past year. :(

So guess I'm quite lucky sense look back year find lot positives it. also much looking forward with. got last year ended...poorly. Constant end-of-pandemic edging administration would never admit huge fucking issue. 

Nobody would commit serious lockdown since ""gonna done 2 weeks"" damn year. many great super fun things news since election. bad Trump make virus leave magic like competent Biden could. friend deluded tbh, I'd wager one go events/outings/concerts anyway this. I’ve sex fine last year. Must you. Yup, suicidal thoughts high year cause it. 

My issue is/was feel lonely without friends family can't make irl friends pandemic lol fuck right. 

But I'm managing! get first shot Tuesday. gives hope. Crazy senate remove parts bill still get republican support. hope change mind. Covid symptoms, covid long hauler symptoms, way worse whatever vaccine could you. *shouldn't* this, case 'grandstanding' making pronouncement. Unfortunately, uneducated think 'Yeah, President this.' 

Anyone clue US system government knows 'ability' within powers Executive branch. matter making statements 'you allowed take vaccine'.. - got vaccine, make -- get many people possible. That. Simple.

Don't need anyone tell -- concept 'leaders' illogical -- infrastructure thing, keeping people alive thing anyone see do.

Just waiting around producing vaccines 'I dunno these, cannot make decision need wait told do'.. - simple IMMEDIATELY distributing vaccines vulnerable people -- everyone accordingly. simple. waiting around. Illogical.

'leader told keep walking along path bridge coming up, leader NEVER wrong - simply close eyes ears keep walking' -- \*bridge collapses, falls cliff..

Btw thing 'countries', like we're people ie attracted giant rock floating depths space.. We're literally people - like 'pledge allegiance' 'flags' -- made up. Literally made up. We're people so.. Like - think someone else. Chanting sounds 'country' - making symbols, colors rectangular piece fabric -- matters looking -- keeping everyone alive. Seriously, global pandemic? Move Alaska, opened vaccines 16. :) really definetly mask mandate Pneumonia 10 100x fatal corona virus. I’ve both. felt like going die pneumonia didn’t realize even COVID. know everyone reacts differently really can’t compare two.. like equating chicken pox small pox. summer plenty hospital beds open die least got second Moderna today! Serious question; care people aren’t vaccinated? be, want risk getting sick that’s problem mine.

Why punish people right thing? Yeah might. Could mean vaccinated citizens countries high vaccination rates travel other. We’ll see Ohio possible? Sure, possible, data starting show really unlikely. Israel's data shows Pfizer's vaccine 92 percent preventing asymptomatic infection, that's sterilizing immunity.

Ultimately, decide risk comfortable with, starting evidence ppst-vaccination transmission going much problem. Love this! Perfect. Haha yes one year first time posted it.. even mention invoking Defense Production Act increase production supplies needed make vaccines aiding brokering deal Merck Johnson Johnson produce vaccines. Saying administration nothing disingenuous best. single recorded reinfection 3 times. anyone actually gotten three times need get contact CDC studied. 

I don’t care hard get. didn’t get test stop saying COVID. It’s really simple. absolutely reason people saying COVID without getting tested. smoker, counties state smokers eligible. Mine one them, population density. Meanwhile 16 year old smokers state two shots. Mass Also, I'm curious Trump administration signed vaccine deals lost election. Something tells me, knew get credit it, probably everything could sabotage Biden. Gooood lord that’s flashback feels like million life times ago 11 months ago. Could month, could matter weeks. We’ll see finally, fuck dipshits working home getting essential workers first? shit making furious. mean, knew needed therapist like 8 months ago, unfortunately, that's available right zoom therapy someone word dumbass father? I'm still recovering trying explain flu = influenza him...  fucking love you.

Edit: Btw I’m double vaccinated framed vaccine card desk instigate discussions vaccine flush fearful help reassure it’s safe. state in? see many friends peers spouting the, ""Vaccines make immune prevent spreading others,"" line, I'm going sure blast chance get. I'm sick fatalistic downers. work hiring? point think i’d participate ancient greek orgy. i’m alone want every visual reminder shit parade gone. Thanks that. It’s easy assume whenever variant described “more transmissible” prior strains, would mean also virulent/severe prior forms. Somehow aspect covered much west, perhaps researchers aren’t sure yet strains novel.

I wonder would also correlate quicker onset symptoms initial infection, would actually helpful far taming variants moving forward. seen studies data attempt re-evaluate system onset timeframe (still averaging 7 days afaik). fully expected we'd 3 million day week,

We still can. Look toward weekends highest numbers come in
  think highest day like 2.5 million.
 
Our highest day 2.9 million March 6 lost 110lbs time.

Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice He'll still blamed Republicans base causing Covid-19 first place; He'll also blamed several hundred thousand Americans died it.

I'll put money two $GME. Hooray, we'll finally able stuff indoors 105 degrees. Texans rejoice. Thank do. There’s light end tunnel fun little cliches think of. meaning doses, one dose Certain counties PA allowing restaurant workers get vaccine.  Stuff like makes wonder way use ignorance positive results. example, someone already going believe anything see Facebook could fill feed headlines like ""Kim Jong Un text messages leaked, says every unvaccinated American victory North Korea!""

If already going believe lies, could least get believe lies result improving situation instead making worse?  I... really see asking. trials done months ago, see recent CDC guideline shift would affected all.

When efficacy trial, take sample people, we'll use 1000 people example. give 500 vaccine, others get placebo, know one got. everybody goes lives life normally. That's called ""blinded study."" time later, look groups see many people got sick group, that's determine efficacy vaccine. everybody blinded going in, following essentially precautions, masks distancing skew results. longer

What “a longer”? end then? ones going tear mask face mandates lifted want keep wearing it. Doesn’t mean get force vaccinated people keep wearing That’s guess. Maybe it’ll make baby bust we’ve seen Hey that's totally cool. let people decide put body. medical treatment requires consent. Eligible. Meaning sign get it. dad seemed pretty vaccine hesitant ( long time rush Limbaugh listener) tried push dig heels much. asked ask Doctor Cardiologist it. texted day setting drive appointment. think people like 2 fold, saw lot people knows got we’re oK, trusts doctor. I’m happy didn’t argue since trip planned early summer! wouldn’t burn masks, they’ve served well. Mementos major event history. That’s though Absolutely. people go away. basically happen corona basically run rampant social circles arent vaccinated thing left govt force people get vaccinated case Cervical cancer almost always caused HPV. HPV shot protects virus causes cancer. ? Source? even understand ur answer downvoted.  said *after* *first thing I'll do* fucking pedantry drives nuts Covid may even thing. engaged China productively may known much sooner able contain it. Exactly seriously addressed far, far earlier one year this. Gotcha... meant they're living fear covid. potentially dumb question I’m sure ask.

I 6-month old son. husband get vaxxed, still possible us bring home him? example contact someone it, protected, could still get it? don’t know things “back normal” babies kids. Like don’t plan bringing son restaurant vaccinated. Anyone insight? .... I've pneumonia x3 would recommend. I've careful crap. Media makes headlines like politicians stripes. Chill first rave post covid going legendary. Yet one answered question. everyone vaccinated everything open teachers unions still resist name heroism. Hmm. ruined summer ruined human species.

Must...thunk....hard....

You can't serious. There'd far less deaths, that's sure. see 3/4 update CDC ""However, second doses administered within grace period 4 days earlier recommended date second dose still considered  agree 60 get 30? (Not counting medical issues put high risk category) work still exists? I’m jealous Canadian. might 70-100+ people vaccinated then.... September earliest everyone I’ve seen. seeing faces gonna really strange. know bunch people dog park, see lot multiple times week. lot recognize without mask (i would recognize dog). seem smart I’ll ask dumb question. vaccine stops spread shouldn’t Israel’s case numbers fall cliff faster have? lag - takes time vaccine become effective? TN here. Drive 45 minutes direction away Nashville, find closest walmart, walk asking extras. Either people want thing people know get joking, summer US many vaccines expect Joe Biden engaging Vaccine Diplomacy. interesting see looks like. test shame? someone lives NH frequently visits northern NH VT agree... entirely selfish reasons. people want live stay way? saw tweet say “people tl really think covid better summer I’m crying” things aren’t degree improving? don’t vaccine? They’re fucking weirdos think mean “hindsight 2020.” I’ll see out... really June? Fauci saying might a”semblance” normality end year. “maybe” people gather 4th July. people talking vaccine passports Zero covid. point people going put foot  No. sitting tens millions vaccine doses already, vaccine likely approved while. 

You position help others, actively refusing to. Yeah, people start realizing got vaccinated still getting sick new variants. Yeah, I'm hopeful I've put incredibly important long term trip uk many times now. new goal getting early fall. Fingers crossed! UK far behind us. Europe, hope, start catching rapidly well. county California really great meeting demand. Theres mass vacc event almost daily large county. That’s technically forcing. That’s incentivizing. It’s way got states enact uniform drinking ages, etc. Uh guy still variants deal with, South Africa variant reduces Pfizer antibodies 2/3.

Once booster shots widely available, won’t another 6-12 months think we’ll see people able truly feel comfortable going big crowds again

Also hoping new lethal variants pop become dominant strain, we’re much woods working retail height pandemic every single day I’d 5+ people griping evil masks freedoms infringed upon Roaring 20’s, anyone? politicians unprepared. looking world whole see nobody right get go. Even countries listened experts screwed up. Stick me!!!! got Moderna 3/5...today first day side effects. rough week. I've never positive covid test, but, experience, think cold October probably it. 

Let's hope second shot bad! gonorrhea already problem we're essentially last antibiotic resistant to. we're done. Pretty scary actually.  Important include Danish Austrian fatalities received batch vaccine.  Honestly really don’t understand position. get huge bump vaccine supply allow mass vaccination sites wide spread. prioritizing elderly huge swath Americans weeks away getting first doses. I’ve known enough (non elderly) people crappy time Covid see value keeping semblance measures till rollout. know 59 year old got ventilator, know 37 year old mom hospitalized multiple clots including pretty serious pulmonary embolism, pretty well liked public figure area dropped dead 42 clot brain.  course rare 80yo tough time Covid rollout would also cover matter 3 weeks. 

Most restaurants open many public venues.  Games beginning open don’t understand race ditch masks semblance distancing weeks way ahead rollout.

My biggest beef though workplace precautions rolled back.  feel like restaurants bars etc something choose partaking (unless course work there).  workplaces offices etc. something people avoid next 2 months. Yet offices shoving people back together conference rooms first time year, loosening mask guidelines etc.  Basically things would fine June.  reason now. looking this. Lots people going 4th July parties regardless. guy work day boasting never stopped gatherings house basically change anything. 

The United States broken see fix it. culture

Ha, good one. cost living 2.6 times high SF compared rest united states. I'm failing understand point. year surviving, thriving  Yes called buying selling. United States extras sell Canada buy them. Pretty basic stuff understand Biden doesn’t fuck around says he’s going something. Also signed aid bill today too! Whats wrong Belt road initiative? good? source number. too, 70 lbs early life identity crisis!

You play off, hilarious. got lot interest opposite sex point time. 

Basically everyone, go lose weight get shape. Makes life much better. That's advice. 

And answer calories calories out. End story. 80-85% diet, 15-20% exercise. lose weight exercise. Plenty do. I'd suggest walks around block least. Throw earbuds. Maybe wall pushups.

Nothing top. like ""I'm gonna go hard!"" crazy stuff. fail every time. Lose 2 lbs week. adds up, quick. *cough* national guard would perfect Nice joke 😂 Pot, meet kettle Yes Antivaxxers come many different forms.  could make argument literally anything. Like Brandenburg Test. Yeah, autocorrect. Thanks. media echo chambers keep lied to. Thanks, fixed it. Yes. percentage us population kids can’t vaccinated yet? let close 30% need every adult vaccinated know that’s gonna happen. say cutoff 26? doctor told ineligible person mid 30's. like that, Draw 4 card: [Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sues Austin mask mandate | Texas /r/2007scape unite! weird one first things want things safer go Burger King family sit meal restaurant? something...normal again. Hug death scream gnash teeth everyday . Look I'll fully agree EU reduced confidence AZ whole 8% efficiency german newspaper Macron saying quasi ineffective etc that's whole different matter this. 

Ofcourse AZ safe approved otherwise far blood clot cases higher normal right likely turn nothing. atleast health authorities fully rule they've concluded investigation. hope give abit confidence they're closely monitoring vaccines even approval. could also rule potential bad batches may be. Probably won’t summer. SE Asian countries likely going remain closed next year. I'm happy guys america. faster get faster country starts getting vaccinated That’s interesting thought process called “Surviver Bias” 

Definition: Survivorship bias survival bias logical error concentrating people things made past selection process overlooking not, typically lack visibility. lead false conclusions several different ways. form selection bias. 

Because can’t ask people died flu, pneumonia, COVID, think viruses, end hearing people survived, people think wasn’t bad... Gotta keep fear big positive news today Good news neighbours! :)

We'll begin soon vaccinate 65+ year old people side. I'm still waiting Super bowl surge I'll never understand many people refuse acknowledge this. Yay! get real birthday party year!  course prepared fault experts, fault politicians controlling how/when/what experts allowed release information make recommendations. perfectly viable playbook thrown 4 years ago. “Vaccine still enough protection variants”

*BuT VaRiAnTs* about, want, others want? wouldn’t see not. You’re US citizen. I’m looking forward going theater see Black Widow. pneumonia deaths (alone, positive Covid test) completely separate many Covid cases gave patient pneumonia, ending death - can't compare two. false Covid fucking causes pneumonia. 



You know exactly honesty pity believe transparent bullshit. doesn’t make automatically shut weirdo. Things improving yes aren’t woods exact moment.  wont take it, neither black community, dont trust honkeys  thing learned people pandemic horribly selfish. Guys please remember, vaccine replacement condom pulling out. Summer might wild picking bouquet oopsie daisies likely people talking vaccine passports debating go “zero Covid”  think want 100% certain announcing anything. It’s rough ounce prevention worth pound cure. Bruh newly anti-vaxx family members blow mind. Like, gave son 30 vaccines born received metric ton immigrated here, question getting shot with? ridiculous That’s almost double median income United States. one. nothing scientific process. wanted frontline workers, obviously knew would work reduce spread. Otherwise, use them?

The problem people charge prepared this.

This issue USA. Spain saw problem here.

We need able admit mistakes. It’s grow society.

We take thing seriously late. Boarders certain countries closed way earlier. hope future react faster. Hopefully meaning governments take seriously domestic breakout potential pandemic. Yep, moved away rest family still there. tomorrow vaccinated I'm worried regards this. fully vaccinated, need two shots COVID-19 get COVID-19 vaccine requires two shots, considered fully vaccinated two weeks second shot. Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna COVID-19 vaccines require two get COVID-19 vaccine requires one shot, considered fully vaccinated two weeks shot. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine requires one shot.

Understanding COVID-19 Vaccines someone lives maryland, cicadas ready welcome us Shit's going like 80s, people actually went outside hung out. week tweeted graph showed Israeli severe cases going wrote tweet going up. like 800 retweets. honestly thought losing mind missed point too. 

I said agree baby steps need taken start 4 months like Biden said. Obviously thats solving anyone's problems right now, inaccurate least misleading say Biden sharing without mentioning plans sharing everyone US gets dose. Small gatherings safe expect go packed concert anything.  Call around ask unused vaccines places giving out, someone misses appointment they’d much rather give vaccine throw out. Hopefully thats sarcasm needed minds, people getting depressed. Woooooooooooo! Thanks Uncle Joe. Sure. write ""Biden said share US vaccines"" solving anyone's problems right now. 
Plus, I'd say trying make money excess products really no-brainer here. /r/Beetlejuicing ? summer going absolutely push vaccines limits... it’s going scary hopefully time enough people fully vaccinated don’t see another huge wave. It’s definitely gonna interesting see ends happening I'm concerned people qualified give vaccinations, but, fingers crossed I'm negative. know! Half normal DREAM! Okay that's different saying nonsense. man setting official date vaccine eligibility dropped, though would dropped regardless.

Why nonsense? seems needlessly critical. know vaccines coming. year home, year distant family loved ones.. Living city within 10 minutes two different states I’m eligible vaccine, can’t state residency - I’m tempted cut line. 
Tell I’m wrong?  I've cautious year, line? basically miracle vaccines effective, reduce COVID risk diseases seemed rare beforehand. wear masks distance then, right?

Why need 100% effective vaccine, mean, basically right? replies evidence dénialism never lockdowns, masks, testing, even vaccines pandemic conspiracy mongering  lol


will fans...that packed stadiums LAST year peak... come back? 


uh- lemme think! vaccinations require fully FDA approved, unlike these. Kind disingenuous exclude FDA hasn’t approved emergency use authorization. Yes. realize order things two different places? know that’s tough concept. Ignore anti-Trudeau NP drivel, first result Google. something like 30% African Americans expressed skepticism vacccines. think race isn’t relevant hey, maybe we’re along thought. However that’s rather naive way look things. numerous pieces access vaccines relates race. New York Times runs one every week seems. I’ll stop injecting race everybody else does. I’m looking flip side:  minorities get vaccinated. like whites don’t. do? answer apply standards I’m totally cool that. Something tells wouldn’t case excuses would made political camp. Pretty much 6% Icelandic people cannot don’t want get vaccinated.  answer question. Vaccinations definitely key part reopening. mean ""the start""? Trump signed executive order December 8th countries already signed deals pfizer (e.g. canada) hoping rely US supply chain change relying EU. Yeah, hated color suit mustard choice. real scandals! Schools already require students certain vaccinations attend classes. dont think realm reality covid vaccines also requirement. greater good laws need change it. common misconception receiving vaccine makes immune, doesn't. minimizes affects virus, even vaccinated still get covid pass someone else. want go countries visiting aggressive American politics? 2019 visited Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Jordan thing remotely close heard someone making joke Trump's expense Jordan. vaccine life 100% effective.

Yeah that's said first time told know science vaccines, want restrictions flu every single year too? 

The flu much less deadly, fewer complications, much less contagious, would probably better flu well, yes. lot old people immune compromised die flu people get work condescending.

Get mirror. responded condescension pointing knowledge pointing wrong that:

1. engage actually said (didn't listen).

2. started making personal attacks based guesswork (bad fath).

If want behavior called out, engage it.  Considering immense pain cancer caused HPV is, actually think mandate HPV vaccines. spread easily literally gives cancer. People reproductive organs also experience shit tons unknown origin issues like endo, fibroids, cysts etc need figure HPV causing issues imo.

I think flu shot also strongly recommended. 

But think rather require, incentivize. couple hundred flu shot would incentivize help us curtail flu spread. Oh, weird. We’ve couple months now. Thought something Slightly sick? case I'd take readily flu shot. 3 people know vaccine 3 bed ridden day two feeling miserable cried pain touched getting 2nd shot. ain't anti vaxxer cautious get it. ain't rush. keep wear mask. good enough last year itll good enough longer activity 99.7 survival rate would considered insanely dangerous.

they havent seen son year. bday day shut happened Exactly end May like worst case scenario. Thanks math. Oh *for sure* already one. mental health complete disaster right now, I'm someone who's situation pretty good (comparatively) actively sees therapist. can't even imagine folks experienced worst financial/work/etc. stressors can't afford seek help must feeling. Jesus Christ. He’s going pay politically doesn’t start endorsing faster return normalcy. anti-nucleocapsid antibody tests work. vaccine elicits immune response spike protein. antibody tests spike protein work -like Kroger $10 LabCorp one. people know doubt say know long term side effects since new vaccine. Greece we've 2 babies die last week. never happened pre-British variant although get 'proof' anything Hucksters? I’m getting vaccine. didn’t express opinion I’m doing. simply asking question “what happens when...”. response person gets fired doesn’t end MSNBC decrying unfair they’ve treated fine. point you’re applying fairly problem. know get hate from. ""Countries"" political entities never criticized Americans. Individual citizens may have, think hate towards Americans seem imply. European people know even care international politics criticised Trump administration, clear reasons (anti-masker president, one thing?) saw Americans victims administration. Which, way, opinions also shared many Americans know.

I seen anything even remotely similar calling Americans ""stupid"", ""pathetic"", ""morons"" ""subhuman fucks""; I'm sure done somewhere (people come flavors people full hate everywhere) I'm really sorry subject kind hate speech, surely represent though typical European person.

I generally good image American people. several friends there, work closely many people there. believe made bad choice Trump (again, opinion shared many Americans) nothing country lecture about: I'm Spain experts electing awful politicians well. said, hope many compatriots share salty attitude support greedy vaccine hoarding. *that* would reason worse opinion Americans, honestly crappy attitude towards bloc countries always allies suffering. It’s possible it’s linked people Covid getting vaccine I’m sure agree. 
The problem supply, vaccinating everyone evenly would take long time significant mutations spike protein could take hold time. 

Getting high population immunity vaccine quickly reduces risk allowing virus propagate sufficiently restrictions lifted. 

So ideal world unlimited supply vaccines agree, perhaps currently. 
The real test various countries lifting restrictions travel becoming popular again. Oops thanks.  novel coronavirus infect vaccinated host (replicate within host), also use host “jump” another host, lead transmission virus, possibly illness hosts vaccinated.

By token, vaccinated surrounded people vaccinated, may catch disease (they get sick). However, catch virus pass others vaccinated may get sick result.

However, vaccines, interaction immune system, expected reduce infection (virus replication) hence virus transmission level. Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax Moderna reported vaccines reduce virus transmission.

This couple days ago. something recent let know. 


These preliminary data appear supported countries vaccinated large portion population, Israel United Kingdom. Israel, vaccinated 75 per cent older population, reported 33 per cent decrease transmission rate age group.

In nutshell, current COVID-19 vaccines provide immunity disease, impact transmission virus yet fully determined. must understand impact pandemic protect underlying health conditions may respond vaccination cannot vaccinated.

[However, Johnson &amp; Johnson Phase 3 clinical trial shows vaccine efficacy rate 60 per cent moderate severe COVID-19 caused B.1.351 variant (dominant South Africa) 66 per cent moderate severe COVID-19 caused P1 variant (dominant Brazil). vaccine overall efficacy rate 85 per cent severe COVID-19 across variants. Novavax vaccine fared well B.1.1.7, dominant U.K., efficacy rate 85.6 per cent symptomatic COVID-19, 60 per cent B.1.351 (after removing HIV positive volunteers). mRNA vaccines’ Phase 3 clinical trials done United States only, time circulation virus variants. Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech shown vaccines reduced efficacy rate B.1.1.7 B.1.351 variants, compared non-variant strain, efficacy still considerable. Recently, Oxford/AstraZeneca reported vaccine efficacious B.1.1.7 everyone vaccinated I’m sure see harm gatherings would considered larger “small gatherings”. enough vaccines everyone May, people vaccinated July 4 ones don’t want vaccinated 🤷‍♂️not waiting around them. Let's gooooooooooo! I'm graduating May weeks job starts. GONNA LIT!!! 9? What's that, quarter page? even notice additions. Yes. Plus, one day event. so? 30 old now? mandated everyone. You’d see handful people hear wearing them. “Moot point” countries yeah. Many European countries worst yet come vaccines British Variant deal  I’d say says things he’s sure of. kind want public official. honest, hit 100m vaccinated 100 days quite easily instead goal 100m doses 100 days. No, never made claim.

You might antibodies get vaccinated twice (roughly getting infected twice) immune response better (unless link me?)

It’s unreasonable, it’s impossible. Therefore, default, it’s impossible say vaccines 100% safe. let’s that. insane. Period. jabs less year trial data. They're experimental. Typically takes 10 years trial data approval. completely detached reality. Wow. blind??? tested positive day vaccination appointment. higher level vaccine immunity preventing infection provides huge evolutionary pressure select strains evade vaccine immunity. That’s vaccine boosters developed.

Perhaps US getting priority threw large amounts money vaccine developers back previous administration order get things moving quickly. Eh, least Pfizer seems transparent issues, actually fix it. Shit happens, AZ handled said shit quite shitty. course post this, it’s impossible find time slot next state.

Stop baby, get shot let's move on.

It's phase 3 clinical trial published lancet. 2 standard doses 12 weeks state opinion assumptions based available, controlled data.

Fine. feel Americans realize offensive policy closest allies. happened 9/11 Canada took thousands American travellers, never happen again. Canada moment greatest need, America said ""sure get first maybe might toss ya few"". 

We choice tolerate America, speaking myself, brotherhood done. illustrated well Canada needs take care Canada first means Americans die government fucks something up, is. Americans people point clearly made. Honestly? problem locking long beat thing, vaccine vaccine. would anyone problem right thing saving lives? Hahaha except world news since we've literally worst months now.

Sorry pea brain understand per capita stats they're useful raw Yeah? Give another two weeks, wait. Even information, would surely hard answer.

But say couple things

First didn’t say you’re metric using real world analysis wrong inferior anything like that. said using strictly clinical trials basis comparisons basically using obtain large ballpark kind estimate, never guessed exact vaccine efficacy anything sort. broad data extrapolation. 

Secondly far im aware data showing 81.3% efficacy AZ’s vaccine double blinded trial, even trial all. efficacy number obtained real world analysis post trial, actually double blinded placebo large scale Phase 3 even Phase 2 trial showing efficacy Im unaware it

Thirdly, much aware, someone involved clinical trials worked biotech good bad practice comes comparing data. Realistically kind comparison case would stand rigorous scientific protocol, wasn’t point. state opinion assumptions based available, controlled data least amount variables, stated believed opinion correct broadly supported available data

Lastly, don’t really know you’re point is. said using two different metrics support respective opinions.

Like vaccinated people guidelines. scientists coming saying ""no way"" know vaccinated people spread covid borderline lying think telling truth would change public behavior much cause unvaccinated lie vaccinated spread covid.

I appreciate lied I'm vaccinated listening them. care reasons lying noble. vaccinated hard way, never positive test. physical distance requirements strongly implies common settings leaving home

I've seen little people talking this. grandmother advanced dementia bed bound. physical way leave home get vaccinated unless ambulance. local Walgreens' pharmacist said he'll make trip house vaccinate get in, got yet. hidden population left vulnerable disease, everyone seems shrug shoulders like, ""Meh, they're gonna die soon anyway.""

like bruh They'll remember headlines. EU export many vaccines faces critical supply shortages now? downvoted asking question. 

The short answer safe use annual shot. Based know, cause side effects traditional vaccines. complete negligence def disqualifying. patient contact even higher risk getting disease transmitting it. it’s borderline criminal. People understand introverts are. explained introverts lose energy people extroverts gain energy people I'm sure that's part something havnt seen mentioned yet commercial real estate often leases thst many years long. former employers closed one offices, 10 year lease hq, it'd harm company image break it.

Yeah, schools in, many areas, people working home, handshaking, reduced capacity restaurants, large gatherings - hard say much masks reduced flu spread since many confounding variables.  certainly hurt, fair, probably getting flu someone pass grocery isle. likely get flu friend, family member co-worker spend significant time with. think would good off-ramp people want masks *healthy people* stick, seems thing certain parts country. There's going uncertainty years.

Because there's reason believe there's anything wrong ""mixing"" vaccines, boosters, etc. _probably_ fine.

But _tested_, FDA formally say okay unless someone runs clinical trial.

But there's lot benefit manufacturers run trial, COVID rates fall trials take longer longer run. might formal guidance without lowering immunity 2-3 years.

But likely okay. likely convey better immunity lower immunity. Sure 2 3% chance long term effects much higher sub 1 chance hospitalization nearly neglible chance death.

I read study here’s ascertained:

They compared number year old’s mechanical ventilators (used proxy severe COVID case) number &lt;50 year old’s ventilators. 

The reason 85% year crowd Israel received dosages Pfizer vaccine compared 10% &lt;50year population. 

They compared ratio rolling average populations found ratio dropped approx 6:1 2:1 marking 67% decrease ratio severe cases attribute vaccine. 

But data table 2 shows something different. 

When compare number 70 year olds ventilators population fully dosed number people age 70 ventilators fully dosed, stayed even increased. 

Then look rolling average number &lt;50 years age ventilators numbers also increasing. 

Of course numbers looked context shows less 0.0001% population actually part severe covid case contingent. Also don’t make mention existing medical conditions said data. 

So conclusion 67% number really shows nothing base population numbers severe case doses vaccine stayed increased. 

I hard time finding data/study 94% number. Would greatly appreciate help. 

This fascinating discussion. Good know, thank you! Fuck yeah. I’m hopeful hit 3 million sometime week. get 5 million day that’s basically demand know tons people love pretend everything black white, example usual black white narrative super duper proof hypocrisy, usual gray areas. Legal experts precedent strongly support idea that so long vaccination policies certain exceptions, job-related are consistent business necessity, vaccination documents perfectly fine ask require, especially job puts employee around others risk.  small gathering right okay private businesses discriminating grounds too, race, religion sexual orientation? okay line political narrative? pleasure! get confusing. We're sure there. mental health NEVER bad. think thing made pull toddler, dragging point. I'm medication first time life. Truth, body choice People also forget USSR far eradicate polio US, Salk vaccine ever did.

As turns out, US effective polio vaccine would give countries politically aligned US, even enough them.

Meanwhile, world tried ignore improved Sabin vaccines Soviets developed, Soviets went ahead gave everyone, including even western countries.

At point, narrative Russia Mordor racist. kids need vaccinated too, IMO. unaware two types approval.

Any source provide goes bit detail? Looks like [pulled really blame though... think monoclonal antibody treatment readily available ? March 15th - 444,600 doses Pfizer Got it, thanks satisfying curiosity! cited vaccination rate vaccine approved US - that's dishonest.

The Johnson&amp;Johnson approved US emergency authorization 66% effective. chosen ignore order accuse title article clearly states Americans rest world completely irrelevant far article concerned.

I respond article. responded comment replies coercing people get vaccinated via forced mandatory COVID tests again- already require vaccines schools- saying shouldn't?

Now that's dishonest. never said anything schools, vaccine-as-entry-requirement buildings institutions, insinuating somewhere everything I've said contains something children schools. No, never brought actually didn't. reasonable person debate would well aware that- again- arguing dishonestly.

But yet, defining clear vaccine completely safe reason opt-opt- risk want benefits vaccination without take risk. want eat cake too.

Those words, them. thought reasonable person decided insult character yet ""life"" first right mentioned Declaration Independence mentioned liberty Constitution :)

Personally always found time bus train, walking, meditative break work home. I'd read listen podcasts just... nothing. Smart. know what’s coming preparing avert worst it.  Uh see private employers rights vouched constantly Reddit. isn’t surprising. sincerely doubt happened. Yep unfortunately there's 500k people u.s. fine. definitely question worth asking. I'm ""glad"" restrictions try save lives, definitely something consider whether truly worth end. guess perhaps we'll never know - estimates many might've died (millions) knows, maybe whole world said fuck done nothing, might've gotten bad strain emerging killing way more. 100% believe people eligible get vaccinated companies/schools right make internal policies employees/students vaccinated. However, hesitant mandating customers (think theme parks, travel, restaurants, movie theaters) may drive divide ""haves"" ""have nots"" comes getting access ability afford vaccines. people may eligible forced prove vaccination status (or underlying health condition) paying service.
Note: different requiring people wear masks enforcing dress code.
Proving vaccine status likely requires someone already ID means visit vaccination sites. Many vulnerable people country either these.  supposed new plan 16th takes account two new vaccines getting approved use Canada. shit that's gone pandemic though hard get hopes sort official announcement though.

Also spread parts Canadian population is, hard move vaccine at-risk communities (or bring hospital get sick) lot communities getting pushed front line. That's **good** thing, doing, pushes people ahead ""younger"" age groups thus get moved farther back line. many articles Atlantic saying basic thing? I’m frustrated stories right now. town farmers market. haven’t since moved here. wanted check tonight feel like it’s safe. I’m little nervous feel like gut telling go despite fact it’s outside. there’s also ton people Friday nights too. 

I think I’ll fine I’m still slightly anxious ""much anything"" 

Oof dude, decreased efficacy catching variant reason nix vaccinations, especially simple exposure variant increases chances variation... confuse efficacy preventing infection risk severe disease death.

"" Johnson &amp; Johnson conducted trials South Africa, variant first identified widespread, found vaccine [64 percent effective preventing moderate severe ""

"" even though certain vaccines appear less effective South African strain, shots still seem offer strong protection developing severe illness strain. "" gotta say quickly opening new age tiers, demand must low eligible tiers. Opening age groups may sign demand low higher age groups.

However, lack demand elders may good news younger folk. Less 20% Americans know someone died COVID death sickness play role this, nearly 100% teens impacted isolation. Maybe lost year friends, freshman year college, prom, sports season, graduation, school play, band concert, asking crush date, going first solo travel, etc. kids still serve reservoir disease spread unvaccinated, end hospitalized large numbers.

Where getting 84%? saying wrong, seen number high.

Also, think Israel experience directly comparable US. Israel going significantly restrict freedoms unvaccinated giving passes vaccinated, meaning choice vaccinate immediate personal cost. US going anything sort; respect rights individuals vaccinated. going come heavy cost. too, live Oklahoma mine DHEC website. Google DHEC vaccine appointments. follow links locate nearby vaccine site. ones listed DHEC name ones want. choose whichever closest you. answer eligibility questions. bring page check box understand TOS whatever. click OK Start whatever says. point get list areas SC offer vaccine. likely unavailable. tedious part. keep refreshing page. ones hours away keep popping disappearing quickly.

It’s next logical step raw supply taken care proof majority users bots shills? honest, sounds like sharing conspiracy theories uneducated opinions regular people critical thinking skills downvoting you.

This grandiose conspiracy brainwashing, though sorry afraid modern world must resort explanations like this. simply vaccine fight virus killed 2.5 million people past year. 

That said, really understand fear hesitancy might have. fine personally believe right decide comfortable taking vaccine currently. However, spreading fear concern despite scientific evidence vaccine safe effective unhelpful harmful. 

Science best method approaching truth certainty world untrusting certain scientific developments, carefully examine techniques methodology used development developments instead simply writing everything agree understand conspiracy/bots/shills/etc. kid July. it’s gonna lit nursery feel like I'm weird wanting work home anymore. Maybe like 1 day week would ok. never required proof vaccinations anything except school maybe. understand change sudden. also makes sense economically let people relatively safe travel, travel. International travel already isn’t fair. Many people poor travel. isn’t fair. Vaccine passports shouldn’t last long supply problems first world countries won’t last forever don’t see it’s big deal enact country vaccinate people. Yeah, except not.

Especially there's already precedent employers schools requiring vaccines. Covid end new seasonal flu, wont get stronger, all. sounds like written people actually think everyone access COViD-19 vaccine. state, people w/ underlying conditions still banned getting vaccinated. underlying condition vast majority people gotten COVID-19 died. able get vaccinated total luxury, banning unvaccinated individuals want vaccinated certain places gross morally wrong. skipped anything.

It’s like 30% difference effectiveness.  would nice, would literally illegal provision vaccine open masses every state.

Walgreens gave $5 coupon got covid vaccine 0 deaths outside Astrazeneca panic last couple days. Something like 1/3 side effects Moderna vaccine, whatever that's worth (far mild actually COVID). real difference duration

Right, duration important. Or, maybe think FDA’s mandated 6 month minimum safety follow period vaccines formality. So, testing undergone. full safety follow required FDA unlike drugs- weird long term effects unexpected interactions- vaccine side effects manifest pretty rapidly.

I see repeated quite bit reddit think it’s one things people see it, latch onto start saying upvote other. [This 2018 talks concerns mRNA vaccines delivered via lipid nanoparticles, including limited Potential safety concerns likely evaluated future preclinical clinical studies include local systemic inflammation, biodistribution persistence expressed immunogen, stimulation auto-reactive antibodies potential toxic effects non-native nucleotides delivery system components.

It doesn’t even make physiological sense people repeatedly say due short half-life mRNA limited duration exposure, long term side effects don’t manifest immediately possible. body exposed damage isn’t apparent long time, even thing caused damage existed body short period.

**If** scientifically uniformly accepted truth vaccines *cannot* cause side effects don’t show while, requirement 6 month safety follow would useless reason. nothing help May 1st date. “extra doses” won’t ready months likely end creating surplus go countries. would literally timeline matter what.

AstraZeneca reported bad news European Union member states Thursday. Belgian government also received phone call email bad news. it, AstraZeneca also adjusts expectations second quarter downwards.

Where Europe counting 180 million doses AstraZeneca's vaccine, company expects able supply 70 million. would bring figure 100 million doses entire first six months, 40 percent initially planned.

AstraZeneca facing persistent production problems Europe. company hoped make blow Europe second quarter importing vaccines international manufacturing network. AstraZeneca produces vaccines US India, among others. half company intended deliver Europe second quarter would imported there.

Export restrictions

But plan unsuccessful. AstraZeneca refers export restrictions put place vaccines many countries, international bid vaccine nationalism.

Not lead blow second quarter, also deliver ten million fewer vaccines planned first quarter. AstraZeneca therefore believes counter 30 million first quarter, 10 million less already significantly reduced original forecast.

Stiff

That tap already felt deliveries next two weeks. delivery schedules April beyond look like yet clarified. Especially April, Belgium still relying heavily deliveries AstraZeneca able stick predetermined schedule. Although earlier expected delivery vaccines Johnson &amp; Johnson may bring relief.

For Europe umpteenth blow grueling vaccination campaign. Many Member States heavily committed AstraZeneca vaccine front cornerstone vaccination campaign stored refrigerator temperature, simplifying distribution compared Pfizer Moderna mRNA vaccines. 40 percent targeted doses, plan wasted.

For AstraZeneca yet another PR nightmare short time. company already bitter dispute Europe missed deliveries first quarter, today European countries also stopped vaccinations AZ vaccine investigate possible side effects. That’s thing got Texas mask mandate. abbot said April would end, feel backlash would less.

If look vaccine ordered per capita, Canada really stand out. ordered wayyy fist world nations. Why?

If uncertainty regards efficacy, effect would vaguely stable across countries. can’t explain variations countries.

The variation stem fact modern vaccine producing capacity. vulnerable export bans producing countries (essentially US EU). double hedge uncertainty efficacy politics production. That’s calculation works. Effectiveness proportion positive cases within vaccine group.

Effectiveness measured relative risk reduction compared placebo group. example, placebo group registered 10 cases vaccine group 2, effectiveness would 80% since risk reduced 80%.

In example, 6 4, risk would reduced 33% (4 cases 33% less 6 cases). vaccine would 33% effective. 

So it’s actually like 6 2. 66.6% efficacy.

Yea, keep talking code, knock xyz really means point dont judge leave tv Inside edition 1 year special one reporters like, masks become new normal life, DINING INDOORS FLEETING MEMORY, gatherings thing past, handshakes? Time tell ever return.

It strange important politically smart thing appeal preferences. 16+ might come soon really young kids could wait bit Pfizer vaccine approved people 16 years old up. Moderna 18 older. Yeah places like Texas chill better spot variants.

But, know, freedom whatever. Georgia Second dose hard. Lots symptoms 
Had go bed!!! months I’d say pathogenic vaccine could actually draw infection cause worse reaction possibility

the vaccine, creates specific antibodies original spike protein covid19, variant comes along different enough spike protein, antibodies wont recognise it, wont protect person infection. 

people non specific antibodies react variants - vaccine induced specific antibodies STOP working. actually turns ability fight coronoviruses

the actual vaccinating people pandemic virus circulating lot worst thing (like finishing course antibiotics) virus able use half vaccinated people mutate infectious deadly strains. 

So theres 3 problems:

The vaccine could malfunction draw infection deeper causing injury death.

The vaccine seemingly turn immune system anything specific spike protein covid19, thereby rendering useless coronoviruses major variants covid19.

The vaccine programme creating virulent expected create deadly strains covid19.

Best case scenario deadly strains dont emerge, peoples immune systems somehow work around vaccine give people kind protection theres malfunctioning vaccine reactions.

Worst case scenario. New strains covid19 emerge vaccine doesnt recognise. deadly ones now. Everyone taken vaccine become severely ill die within next years. doesn’t necessarily mean ever infected infectious. It’s entirely possible small amount virus entered nasal passages, never able make past passive immune system cause infection. 

It’s also possible virus already dead inhaled (say, exposed UVC air filtration still circulating)

In case, high CT PCR test may return positive, time individual may never test positive antibodies. polls 75% adults open receiving vaccine, number increasing past months. easily get 75% adults covered. besides, goal isn’t necessarily “get everyone vaccinated”. goal drive deaths hospitalizations. Vaccinating 75% adults plus everyone isn’t vaccinated natural immunity that. excellent. take word it. Make sure give pats helping get tough times. don’t want get slap fight Reddit narrow image big tech worker sf right (who’d making lot 75k) ignoring huge amounts people rest CA places like NE.

If live parts bay, LA, San Diego, you’ll likely driving still paying 2-4k rent. also paying $150k loans took paralegal entry level finance whatever non-big shot swe job. jobs probably aren’t giving full coverage, rather cost sharing cost health premiums.

Anyways, point isn’t going “oh woe middle class white collar populace big cities, even survive”. It’s pointing they’re largely getting shafted this, someone making $65k middle America $250k mortgage home sitting real pretty. Pay roof repairs basically.

The. Hopefully improving credit score least consolidate rest. still can’t believe hitting 300k infections day one point. I'm virologist, seems make sense never really understood case.

For example, mRNA vaccines basically spike right? Body learns block it, providing 95/94% immunity right? Well getting real deal, also fighting spike well rest virus, effect? vaccine would desirable obvious reasons, would getting real deal also work same?

I'm pretty dumb I'm wrong, it, maybe someone smarter explain otherwise? one friends says dont want vaccine already covid, makes sense me, even though we're told still get vaccine.  Smart way? Politically smart him, sure. know he’s sandbagging he’s truthful us. I’d prefer honesty. varies greatly region. covid vaccine yet, metallic taste 15 minutes flu shot, went away like minute. light though, never before.

I looked online there's much info it, happen sometimes seem harmful Bring full stadiums NFL games. 16+ may able get vaccine pharma companies completed studies FDA approves minors Yep let’s hope pans out. We’ve already promised send excess vaccines population vaccinated. Let’s honest, country access vaccines would want family friends vaccinated first well. Texas Rangers. They'll 100% opening day announcement.   Even unlikely.

Parents might Lockdown, asking teachers anyone interacts children past summer hard ask.


Lockdowns going come like band aid, they'll ripped away. saw Biden supposed “Let Americans small gatherings July 4” everything goes planned. joke. People since last July 4. one wants that. Stop. People realistic. Yes, global problems covid fall. And, makes rage, explode realize kids start vaccination untill fall well. we'll definitely issue country Autumn. Whichever one is.  think really enough May. Even now, supplies increased lot much easier get appointments qualify.

I'll surprised open eligibility nearly everyone mid April. Maybe even early April.

I feel like race reopening economy. neighboring city opening inside dining weekend. family there, there's guarantee husband's coworkers be, parents preschooler's classmates. 20% population won’t get it. 25% population 18. Cut two years Pfizer that’s still another 20% can’t get it. Add ambivalent, transient, ones afraid they’ll deported, million reasons aren’t going break 50% fall earliest. believe 16+ get Pfizer. others completed testing 18 baby due September. would absolutely love case. would vaccine record country implode. you’re welcome write comment German. fit criteria state. big manufacturing plant 30 minutes across state lines here. tons employees show up. qualified manufacturing. check tables told accept work ids, paystubs, even wearing company shirts.

Our guidelines include ""food agricultural"" jobs. tons fast food workers try get one even though clearly instructed restaurants qualify, still let through. Eligibility Shots appointment spots available want it. can’t even get enough shots Phase 1a/1b. Correct I'm wrong, states less stringent priority setting gets vaccines first? actually remember criticized selective enough. saying appropriate criticism time...just probably lot better poised meet Biden's goal lot states restrictions. Can’t fix stupid. “It doesn’t seem safe” based what, exactly? Don’t get wrong, I’ve got friends family members saying same, it’s based conspiracy theories word mouth idiot friends neighbors Facebook.

Ugh. suffer stupidity. people would get less hate empirically time vaccine approved children, we'll massive amount real world data affects adults older teens, flying quite blind making decision them. keep seeing people mentioning this, what's source info? mean 3.1M doses shipped, 3.1M doses administered? Yep, 8 EU countries suspended AstraZeneca use  literally started shouting heard it. I’m gonna lick every pole summer Took antibody test private businesses public institutions enforce mask mandates, without state authority. got swim trunks flippy floppies LOL think airline crews share rooms? 😂 Still better COVID Lol whole speech made cringe even aware was. love news damn man...he needs help. vaccines also generate memory response vs antibody drugs effective however long last body. Seattle resident lmao. We're going 50% capacity indoors March 22 25% stadiums. that's 11 days.


We're gonna partying June. would like confidence, live Chicago area see fumbling bumbling. Fuck come? somehow Trump's performance still worse nothing. RO Detroit River Catholics. everyone gets new social anxiety disorder European Union borrowed time. couple years: Frexit?  Exitaly? Yeah... Good luck that! confirmed today phase WA upcoming fall Anyone high risk group hasn’t least one dose one blame themself point I've survived pneumonia before. fucking sucked. Even guaranteed get sick Covid, I'll take chances vaccine, thank you. exactly area. company pays local average manufacturing positions helps recently got point enough employees. passed we’ll gearing another employee struggle like stimulus packages. We’ve start working temp agency well tell us every company work issue. Can’t blame people wanting work sucks business aren’t people hire. think bigger concern side effects tbh. know several people pegged ""anti-vax"" billion years holding getting vaccine dont want deal symptoms. 

I thought ridiculous 10 days go get first one I'm finding apprehensive. I'm still 100% getting I'm pretty nervous feeling really really bad days. Still need preventive measures like masks social distancing better overall. Wait fairly innocuous comment man come on! policing? hit bar every night probably thing Biden directing he’s ready next life saving pill said 3 billion, key words ""up to"". could stop making vaccines right technically wouldnt lied. thats hedge words work friendo Reinfections rare though, seems even rough It’s nice president who’s actually getting shit done JOB, like holy shit. feel like I’ve heard “production ramping up” many times last 4-6 weeks haven’t truly believed it. home state Pennsylvania total shit show. truly excited next weeks though look forward proven wrong.  Same. Yeeeah it’s going really hard couple months say “double public health measures prevent surge”.  hospital numbers aren’t going support states emergency much longer. You’ll see masks public transport hospitals that’s it.  Yeah children impacted then. Hopefully get good data transmission vaccinated yet infected people. ever saline pushed IV? so, like that? may solution suspend vaccine in. state says July me. wont available adults August. It’s inspiration song “spoonful sugar”! writers son came home school told sugar cubes Same. became eligible Feb 15, got vaccinated Feb 28. imagine much harder people rural areas. Washington state. here. release 50-75 appointments week go within 10 minutes. that's 3 counties. crap. Yes! lucked out. wife got day, ran 101 faber felt like absolute shit. fine. reactions would way could handled infant. millions people received vaccine issues people first got year ago aren’t enough proof it’s safe. millions COVID deaths countless people lingering, cases maybe even permanent, problems biggie. kind like bars tables lined bar state.

It dosent make sense like 3 -4 tables lined bar. instead horizontel vertical islands. I'm Washington state. fill form online prove fit specific tier. I'm healthcare worker, I'm automatically qualified, one town administer.   Who? I'm sorry hear this. I'm Canadian vaccine rollout slow. get it? get people damn vaccine way. way people dropped restrictions last summer, autumn early spring like said would do.

People docile, government tells do. good reason not. ""best free m&amp;ms"" - businesses Right. US sitting 10s millions doses people US need. 75 yr old mother FINALLY get first jab next week! basically like flu, know actually sick (according husband). exactly US gov did? Paid companies manufacture vaccines *while* running trials, they'd ready go passed. company pay money manufacture unless knew sure would work out, government took risk equation. Eligible one thing, getting shots arms whole different story. Making people eligible means supply chain mixups, people really need prioritized get crowded out.

In northeast Illinois, person health conditions, I've ""eligible"" since February 25, really (my county stayed 1B even governor said state 1B+), ""eligible"" sign United Center March 7, really, going give 100,000 appointments 1B+, no, sorry, Chicago residents only, no, sorry, five zip codes Chicago, no, really 50,000 appointments. Meanwhile, appointments come IL sporadic waaaaay far Chicago.

I'll fine. live totally alone, get everything delivered, go nowhere, see nobody. I'll miss deadlines volunteer opportunities, thing I'm learning need learn patience.

Biden direct wants, we're federation states, Biden really control governor, county board, Mayor Chicago. mention FEMA even keeps changing rules, United Center. we're system whole way get shots gamified: try get website right hour rush day's allocations, like buying concert tickets.

We've _whole year_ know time coming, sort centralized scheduling system get vaccines people? No. know I'll get shot via physician, hospital system, county health system, I'll get lucky checking CVS, Jewel-Osco, Mariano's, Walgreens, Wal-Mart.

Good intentions, could backfire. going 70-year old person health conditions gotten shot _yet_ misses healthy 20-something better sniping websites. needs least statewide scheduling system. definitely ugly Brazil, likely win lottery see new strain completely dodges vaccines appear next year. Let's say somehow make $4,000 month, nice math. 

* Rent: $2,000 (either nice studio kinda crappy one bedroom)
* Utilities: $150
* Car Payment: $250
* Student Loans: $750 (let's kid pretend make $75,000 single, non HOH (i.e. young) without this)
* Health insurance: $250 (this total guess)
* Car insurance: $100

AND look that? We're already $3,500 havne't bought food, saved anything, planned retirement. course doable cutting kind close kind semi major expense (car breaks, phone dies, pet gets sick) going issue. said, median household income SF $112k; highly doubt anyone could live alone $75k there. Yet, again, they're forgotten someone middle nowhere thinks they're ""rich."" Plus live roommates still got cut third stimmy, would pissed. 

I think forgetting calculations are, bare minimum, student loan payments insurance. Obviously someone car, save money there, they'd likely spending better apartment. either case, certainly ""You need help"" rich. also right also ouch There's way US giving away vaccines know 100% sure they'll enough quantity vaccine manufacturers. earthquake takes 50% Pfizer production something like that? They'll given away eventually sure, blame US now. right ouch Exactly this. admin sees administration problem coming forces states’ hands solve it. Since I’m least vulnerable demographic wasn’t holding hope would get summer. Monday university work pulled real Chad move announced employees eligible. Got first dose yesterday morning. surreal thinking Indeed. overly worried feel US chaos caused few.

We're managing vaccination well compared rest world, think we've become complacent.

Wish could help, heartbreaking seeing pandemic unfold global level.  :) Thanks. *cries canadian* friend’s mother got Covid pneumonia. positioned face try maximize oxygen intake. kidneys started shutting couldn’t dialysis position. ended passing away. 

Having pneumonia past probably makes mother susceptible getting pneumonia again. want get Covid pneumonia. hope get necessary vaccine is. Thanks :) people like you, might’ve overcome this. Thank you! shoutout people university’s sub said idea in-person fall classes ridiculous downvoted oblivion believing otherwise. lots shut-ins gonna cope idea interacting people regular basis Thank times two. :) Downvoted truth wasn’t - country Denmark doesn’t gamble citizens’ safety That's great! got stipend expenses, got second monitor development work. snacks though. recently got banned r/CoronavirusUK pointing something thought obvious.

**Context:** April, extended Furlough scheme (Britbong Stimulus, 80% job payments upto £2500). Now, bad thing, mean expecting pandemic go longer, did. arrive time period, similar warning signs shooting across board. again, Furlough scheme extended, time September. warned book summer holidays, scientists coming thinly veiled warnings government officials making concrete statements next plans. Things *might* get better, 'data' says so.

Of course, pointing obvious banworthy considered 'fearmongering' put two two together now. different all. Luckily social distancing entire life. Can’t wait border open! people really helping anti-vax movement... go science says instead. Well California, administration always touting literally constraint supply. absolutely expect eligible May raise hell. matter doses, also need people capable administering shots call 24/7 happen got idea Sir let’s weaponize them! one year NBA suspending games declaring global crisis(the holy shit moment made everyone take serious) Bidens speech vaccines give us hope, new turning point - Texas keep 65 infinity time fact, wife’s coworker sent home office earlier week wife tested positive. went bar Friday night hosted indoor kids birthday party Saturday. even knows idiot picked up. Florida like that. 

Jeeze, what's wrong people. hope wife remains well.

Hubby shot waiting 3/15 state opens serious comorbidities. bit white knuckling go! People already gatherings well beyond recommendations

There’s absolutely way vaccinated people aren’t going go completely insane gatherings, ones going blame them, single person going even try enforce rules either Interesting. I’m introvert fears might complete loner. fair live spouse two teens. I’ve decided I’m fine home. Great news- announced today adding 9 new menu items Great idea actually set objectives goals Americans reach for.

Pretty great actually. Hoping get vaccine May sooner possible. Seriously. remember early March really weird stressful last year reasons seem kinda silly lol. March 7 preoccupied couple things happening social work life, clue US going completely shut less week. insane realize fast things change I'm retail worker grocery holy cow I'm glad province's plan puts us Phase 2. third wave happens, happen, everything closes again. That’s birthday, solid choice! So... Basically taking credit previous government plan?

This precisely supposed happen. people US &amp; Canada likely gotten first shot time Novavax gets approved distributed. still need infrastructure administer millions people. can’t let em once. They’ll overwhelmed. whiskey came nose People would pissed Biden 40,000 people died COVID. said, he’s going make far-reaching policy recommendations lot side effects, better account side effects. I’ve said, mental health problems widespread lead negative health consequences death. cannot fucking believe people defending fact mental health problems pandemic almost entirely ignored correct, matter opinion. Trump administration bought hundreds millions vaccines. Every single vaccine we've administered date, every single vaccine going administer next couple months,, bought Trump.

As rollout, that's hard say. sources notion Trump's vaccine rollout disarray?

I'm assuming like Trump. either. important we, unlike supporters, develop informed opinions rather believing something feel true. win. Florida gone red. bad reaction years flu shot. covid ( Pfizer) shot way better. took shot Friday weekend even though really need Sunday. sore arm headache times. get vaccinated cancer?! Huh?? kind cancer vaccine prevent? news want one.  Cleveland hasn’t lucky, every time clinic, 1200 vaccines available 100k people county group 1A &amp; 1B still competing spots. ‘chain’ coffee shops around here. used work Starbucks lot. Starbucks indoor seating limits since last year still isn’t open except select cities Yeah applies practically vaccines. also looking like extremely low chance transmission vaccinated, least mRNA vaccines, lower anybody thought  sounds like he's trying promise deliver, like 100 million vaccines first 100 days. so, best news. Interesting - thought published version recent pre-print Harvard/Northwestern, seems independent that. studies find 2-4% symptoms greater 12+ weeks, number starts look pretty solid. facility opened late 2021 early 2022, earliest. True Please enlighten us What? Mascone center walgreens SF open next day appointments. bot. auto filters certain words. know though. can’t wait lick strangers faces raves omg Soon, couple months left probably CHLAVID21  learning! Even vaccines already (Pfizer, Moderna, AZ), every Canadian eligible get first dose Canada Day (July 1st). Unless Novavax get approved distributed earlier, I'm sure whether help us get finish line quicker. Hi! thing happened mom today (also got appointment meadowlands) also 18 days after. also thought strange since thought 21 days after. hold tight. Getting infected consequences symptoms. father, stressed toddler won’t wear mask every adult walking around potential infect terrifying me. Yes. thousands pharmacies currently giving shots including tons Walmart’s, CVS Walgreens already partners. Ohio instance opening 15 mass vaccine sites next week allow double current amount shots. I’m US citizen living abroad country really slow vaccine rollout. Could fly USA May 1 get vaccine?! seem relevant whether covid vaccines would stand they're used anymore 

They're getting India they're getting Gavi receives India. bilateral agreement place - simply AZ facilities India already.

Responding question weekly news briefing Islamabad afternoon (Thursday), said Pakistan entered bilateral procurement agreement COVID-19 vaccine India. said international vaccine alliance - Gavi offered provide vaccine dozes several countries, including Pakistan COVAX Facility. said procurement supply mechanism vaccine dozes undertaken Gavi recipient countries. - today. Nice try dear little propagandist 

Your link literal Indian propaganda posted political motivation breaking rule 4 sub. also posted numerous subs. Nobody stopping small gathering

I know aren’t... don’t want stopped medium large gatherings months mass vaccination, makes fucking sense Well, maybe they’ll come around people get vaccine feel fine. they’ll get Covid contribute herd immunity way. It’s unfortunate one way another pandemic got end. people add car payment need
It's not. Hellloooooooo roaring 20s!!! Literally nobody denying that. won’t 500,000 people die stay home certain portions year, doesn’t spread uncontrollably way virus does. Fauci also doesn’t specialize mental health blaming doesn’t exactly make sense lol reason this? get it, anti vax? Yeah soooo many people dont want US far ahead scheduling jabbing impressive rate. need start planning now, US getting point vaccinating everyone August 100% guaranteed. holy cow, congrats! I’m pretty sure would done without speech June 19th, totally outdoors. butt still clenched I'm totally fine masks, man, thing may even half normal. already rescheduled last year can't reschedule again. Fingers crossed!! Yeah strange. There's lot anecdotes that, one study showed several-fold (aka small) reduction antibody neutralization natural immunity. studies shown vaccines minimal reduction neutralization; perhaps vaccination substantially better infection immunity (that seems case B.1.351 too).

But concerning issue insanely fast spread quickly lot people died.  rate outpaced lineages seems indicate something like 2.5x contagiousness, killed something like 0.3% (median age 26) month. due immune escape that's better us long-term, possibly even worse short seemingly real-world research that's done, extremely alarming. results Manaus, seemingly last two weeks [Sao hand detected US Europe, amount times find seem rising. 60% sounds pretty good gonna lie past year really disheartening see many people give fuck fellow Americans say gonna that? Noooo. doubt I’ll even hookups anyways I’m insecure lmao think people really thinking through. idea things go back normal, last thing mind taking care another new human. Unless accident. given baby gap that's predicted, people either worried kids depressed even try. I'm fine people do, mandate much longer we've got majority adults vaccinated... idk man. sure take it. significant Europe I'm America alone, unable see person year enough drive insane. us still twenties...barely...  done challenge trails showed people would gleefully go way avoid inconveniencing save people's lives. entire point was, ""no, lift finger to, even kills people."" Wait... 200% 300% ton... we’re talking needing 5% 10% increase here. good Same. decided I'm telling anyone outside family want go back old life. people get sore arm even mild fever flu vaccine. COVID vaccine isn’t much different. Odds won’t feel anything. Millions elderly people received multiple doses far. tolerate it, can. Don’t try reschedule pain ass. 18 days fine wouldn’t sweat it. used 19-23 days clinical trial. sure meadowlands site way think it’s fine Texas pretty close bottom vaccinations. Oregon mess!!! frontline worker well sadly don’t expect get vaccine anytime soon. Yes! miss dancing much! karaoke!! Plus also promising nebulized therapy using mRNA platform stopped replication SARS-Cov2 flu lungs. huge implications COVID viruses well, easily modified target viruses. former wedding photographer outdoor weddings favorites, June means it’ll warm evening people enjoy comfortably

Congratulations good luck :) got text city morning got mine, luckily time think it. Definitely would bit apprehension! Gas prices amazing🙄🙄  Haha sure! reminder vaccinated mean can't still carry virus someone vaccinated. Weird. I'm Bay Area, eligible 22nd, went onto website 25th made appointment 26th. friend lives SF got week ago (same eligibility window). fuck that’s Biden saying. federal government absolutely working administration. mass vaccination site capable 6,000 vaccines per day opened Chicago, run federal government. parents age know people age polio. you? largely ignored issue. Saying wasn’t dishonest. Pretending like mental health problems can’t kill people, lead lower quality life, lead issues ultimately lead people dying earlier also dishonest.

So, much denial issue. Yeah fuck that. Nothing like starting marriage guilt knowing infected loved ones sake wedding haha. would coughed back. Gave fucker lung. ~~Portugal~~ Italy Eastern Europe

/s production news Italy comment. used call Information Superhighway. Seems like folks decided pull stick Route 66. US make sure secure closest allies first, there’s getting around that. Canada Mexico offered first. Canada doesn’t need point Biden go elsewhere. silly response. We've seen time time time pandemic happens get impatient, relaxing restrictions, going (hint: never ends well us). Pointing make ""scared"", makes someone see what's right front face. not? point every single person vulnerable COVID offered vaccine extremely effective preventing hospitalization spread. Like whats end goal here? mean, key phrase “make adults eligible,” necessarily get vaccinated. know people eligible essential workers state since start they’re still vaccinated. It’s important improve distribution processing, even dramatic improvement new admin, we’re still struggling. That’s actually one things liked Trump proposed, Warp Speed great plan help distribution (the military largest jobs provider world) usual, took W turned massive L.

Sorry throwing water fire, don’t want people getting hyped let angry doesn’t work out. Lmaoo got legally married last year original date Head household 110,000. exactly point. couple kids eligible, single mom working nurse NYC living one bedroom apartment huge student loans able qualify? bands narrow lot people needed help slipped cracks. Debatable. can't shit eh Ofc share extra doses world (USA) sorry make sure everyone access start giving away places, Biden pledged that.  really much. Maybe 2-3x current rate easily get us there. 

In travels passed numerous vaccination sites past month, I’m even looking them. instance, California rebalanced vaccine distribution Kaiser Permanente hospitals gets reasonable allocation vaccines given members represents 20% California population. that, KP hospitals getting significantly lower doses members 65 older forced visit county vaccination sites, many would refuse Kaiser members. shift allocation, Santa Clara county redirecting people back Kaiser hospitals Kaiser fine that. No, pretty clearly brushed aside issue. wasn’t treated lesser, part ignored. 

If de facto main public health leader makes far-reaching policy recommendations, better account side effects said recommendations, least consult refer someone can. know what’s funny me..I MS signed Jan 14th able to.. got first shot today.. gf gets tomorrow.. high risk.. gotten way sooner.. Trump bullshit.. got others already getting too.. I’m glad everyone get now.. US. Tell stones areas would even entertain idea deny young black man access anywhere didn’t get vaccinated undesirable. need staff pharmacies, think that’s plan. could now? take mask off... I've already seen people Facebook complain they're deserving vaccine people. People need start caring less others think them. dude 200 million people make 18-65 usa. 

At best vaccinate say 2-3? million day. deaths statistics you, huh? Ok Actually complete opposite. He’s event planner we’d go shows together constantly pandemic. Yes, sharing influence. Lol governor find way fuck up. He’s busy campaigning dangers weed give shit shot. course it’s anecdotal, people know 20s-30s aren’t interested it. 

Personally, Oxford astrazenica trial, obviously I’m concerned risk myself. (Age 38) Yeah can’t even imagine that. hope two get reunited soon. Touche. Thanks presenting evidence incorrect. Credit credit due. Let know ""it's greater good"" long July, I'd like go birthday year.   Yep, basically means give little breather nauseously check news/twitter/etc. complete utter dread every day, stop paying attention completely. Haha exactly. idea people. fully feral point. actually agree. Reopening society dependent working vaccine.

I mean never got one, took years develop, wasn’t effective?

I suppose reason message always lockdowns get vaccine result scientists reassuring world leaders ready relatively soon, something gone wrong? Lockdowns forever?

The idea behind relying insane day one.  People lash phrases like “more normal”
Funny hardest interview I’ve seen Fauci ESPN Trump nothing vaccines, confirmed developers. Well happening cases continue go down, say something right? strictly followed recommended policy beginning 

You mean like wearing masks? rapid tests all, masks all. intra-muscular? don’t know lot city, they’re slow fuck. doesn’t matter came from, it’s still gonna happen know lot people mentally struggling ... agree, still prob less deaths. even compentent leaderships struggled dealing virus ex europe.

its probally american culture though. point is, producing enough vaccines every adult. Man still remember last 4th July neighbors completely ignoring gathering size limits social distancing requirements. everyone shocked new peak Hush... Fauci deity around he. criticize him, worship him! new fast paced line opening j&amp;j vaccine among another Moderna line. lot vaccines out. heard around 3.3 million doses j&amp;j doses go next around 10 million ends March. are, slower rates. Many mistrustful vaccine due fake news. Nevertheless, think around 70% vaccinated now. BC crashes libido may able enjoy roaring 20s keep away anti vaxx idiots might try destroy def underpromise/over deliver style pandemic end get vaccine. pandemic end mask mandates lifted. pandemic end full stadiums music festivals. pandemic really ends given start date actually start job  


Same me. track finally become airline pilot last summer. dream job I've working toward decade, including six year stint Air Force fund training two half years making basically minimum wage flight instructor building required flight time. industry never better new pilots, pay, bonuses, quality life all-time highs. make June July in. 


Now idea I'll make it. could months, could years. devastating close snatched fingertips. Meanwhile, pool potential pilots growing even things pick going much competitive. Fortunately I've found another job keep afloat, want. want life going have. 30 cases 5 million less background level blood clots vaccine advertised anti coagulant. It’s going rich “find out” dozen reasons flu knocked back year. Masks somewhere outside top five. Also FL...people every age wearing masks great. well here. way  need 30. 60 overkill. divorce lawyers! . imagine end March could closing on...maybe 25% 18 fully vaccinated.

Well considering 25% 18 gotten first shot, that's guaranteed. Even still vaccinated yet, point higher risk groups sure worry accidentally killing someone's grandma getting plane. I'm starting plan summer/early fall travel! **I MIGHT ACTUALLY GET FUCK** Best luck! first? First baby joy! don’t think consider fast already expanding. 

The skill required stick needle arm high. find plenty videos YouTube injections (which many people do). learned earlier year give wife B12 injections.

You misspelled Trump. Yeah, I’ll believe shot. everything really effective South Africa type so... two weeks ago, store work suddenly bunch vaccines, like, heads-up. Incidentally, also two days. even find shot came back Sunday.

I say though, credit management store - two three managers somehow managed get name list shot tomorrow morning, get local football stadium 10am. Funnily enough, *that's* part nervous anything. get really anxious driving new places, especially deadline. That, I'm normally waking 10am, 'cause generally work closing shift. Aaaand get work get shot.

Tomorrow's going looong day me. Worth it, long nonetheless. President Biden announced yesterday would share excess vaccines Everyone get second shot, reserved them. People aren’t going second dose. Yup. Even relatives don’t normally want see getting seen. though. Well get caught telling members post pictures vaccinations spring break trips undermines negotiating position, kind lose negotiating position trying protect /r/ihavesex  Meh, get flu shot shit exactly Biden set hard date, we're tsunami vaccine doses states still planning like December 2020 instead getting ready deal flood. I’m optimistic. Hence I’m glad America going fast “Those people complaining mental health selfish. Don’t know there’s *global pandemic*??!?!11!?!one!!?”

Only heard kind thing oh, maybe thousand times last year. Weird messaging changes now, huh? crankylosaurus look like? Moderna vaccine prevent hospitalization deaths UK variant levels (near 100%) compared original strain? inbreds Jared Ivanka involved go smoothly Yeah, PA relatives describing quest get shot mind boggling. 

Because truly quest. first phase/priority group. got shot couple weeks ago trying since first opened. drive 2 hours (one way!) rural county live city never available appointments. really hope things improve soon PA folks! remember that! vaccine invented doctor college.

Something like 90% US workforce considered essential workers. don’t need stay locked homes, isn’t going last forever. think point article acknowledge danger rush reopening everything once. Yes, people vaccinated, nearly enough yet act like things normal again. long people still waiting turn vaccinated, remain vulnerable. 

The responsible thing continue wear masks public - assumption could unknowingly transmitting someone hasn’t yet vaccinated. 

Once us vaccinated, things normal. Hopefully process moves quickly. 1% world die COVID, that's 70,000,000 people dead. 

To put perspective, would like entire population United Kingdom wiped out, Los Angeles top that. I'm Cowlitz. made edit last comment, website says there's location near appointments available, try schedule it, says actually anything available. tried facebook groups, everyone tells go Ridgefield. ability do, even schedule appointment, could make there, work go live. Twitter says thing. Nextdoor? I've never even heard that. Usually spend couple hours day checking local pharmacy websites hopes catching appointment, far, everyone says vaccines exist within county. opened appointments local fairgrounds, appointments went fast. comes directly vaccine manufacturers. vaccinating 2 million people day still ramping production. However actually watched it, stated multiple times don’t know don’t know. anyone? No. fine proof. planning going back work April able get vaccinated LA badge job worked since last March. Thanks! think I'll making phone call tomorrow! mentally challenged? Small gatherings people vaccinated pathetic goal. read comment wrong, read Well yea that’s seemingly end pandemic supposed like.

In next year transition pandemic endemic disease.....assuming vaccine works variants. Ohio residents coming get since Ohio pretty strict guidelines. guess qualify PA smoker overweight specific BMI. I’d bet influx new “smokers”. I'm actually shocked easy rural Idaho get one. Maybe high number antivaccers compared health district allotted. everyone considered essential employee even ask proof employment. fun. choice. Also friends babies Covid, lonely experience less support due able see loved ones. mention potential unknown risks getting severe Covid pregnant. studies came CDC tends conservative. don’t want give recommendation go back it. Every time lessens public trust. already done far much lately. 

I imagine tell people vaccinated don’t wear masks one wear masks. imagine scared infection spike won’t peer pressure non vaccinated wear mask. “100 million shots 100 days”, we’re projected double). 

That's cut original promise ""200m 100 days"" easily-achievable-under-Trump's-numbers ""100m 100 days"" get shit care like iPhones China. hate downer think empathy towards future people going work well anti-vaxxers. Maybe somebody actually conservative fence regarding new vaccine. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think article misunderstood. It’s different Biden said tonight: he’s saying lifting public health measures fast soon would hurt would help delay “end” pandemic. guy advocating indefinite public health measures. We’re far beyond thinking stage point time. Probably depends state! Oregon high risk family members vaccinated. rest likely least partially vaccinated date. Ah, thanks info. looked rotavirus vaccine that's given orally infants. I've seeing propaganda bullshit meme sites increasing ton. One favorite songs times like thinking infected get vaccinated worst case scenario nothing wasted vaccine dose someone else needs.

Fixed you.  Thanks again! elaborate response. It’s PA. I’m IL got invite county/hospital go get first dose today. I’m 22 work home definitely don’t *need* early took first opportunity got. think comes distribution. Certain areas get much vaccine throw away doses, areas get jack shit can’t even vaccinate elderly immunocompromised. Texas find way fuck up, wait Wife fell category made eligible got first dose Monday. asked pharmacist would eligible said run list spare doses could get they’d call.

I afternoon walk got call sprinted whole mile get home head shot today. happy, beginning normal again. I’m sports fan I’m wondering thought would work. 

Just tell Raptors, Leafs, Jets, Sens, Canucks, Flames, Oilers, Jays, TFC, Impact, Whitecaps form league? like working something awesome work boss comes tells thing, idea begin with. joke, even kill.

Thinking COVID-19 death figures foolish. many issues besides that. vaccine Trump took credit company point absolutely fuck it? need get back normal, hate able tell people wearing mask. mask muffles yelling much. life felt like beginning go well. senior high school, trip planned spring break fun second semester works. excited college, saying goodbye friends mailing classes.
I never graduated. wanted cathartic release 4 hard years.
I never saw lot friends teachers again.
And college sucks pandemic. “kinda bullshit” claiming?  No, fair say that, evidence conclusive either way. possible Trumo administration would shit bed? much so. possible Trump administration would closed early gaps we'd roughly place Biden? Also yes. exactly zero reliable data test either hypothesis, there's point. 

This WaPo yesterday offers pretty comprehensive summary things I'm saying. bottom line is, differences rollout plan, Biden's accounts better Trump's, constraint supply, infrastructure. Even today, pool recipients much bigger healthcare workers nursing home patients point to. Again, primary check vaccine administration Trump supply, continues primary check Biden. People get compensated financially getting vaccine. Thankfully year science taught us immune system works virus behave like virus. Probably certain parts country, even sooner. I’m 22 got first dose Pfizer today. I’m essential worker work home area lot extra doses apparently actually throw away doses nobody signing vaccines. It’s truly maddening certain parts country dead zones, mostly due right making political issue. know people next state drive like 3 hours want vaccine right governor done horrible (and purposely bad) job distributing vaccine yet people like probably contributed huge part mental health impacts, willingness disbelieve science refuse wear masks cuz “my freedom” Finally I'll stop seeing ""65 older only"" go book appointment State (GA) still phase 1a :( democratic nation would able lie 2m deaths year. small fraction cannot medical get it. checked doc make sure vaccine reaction happen immediately, CDC says take precautions otherwise I'd risk biscuit. I'm sure might medical reasons people wait I'm sure those. numbers way way LA surrounding area. Ny really locked lol. end summer everyone get vaccine whenever want. literally like 3 mos away. Cases low.  Lol lost vietnam, korea, somalia, afghanistan Well Europe poorly vaccination campaign, everything works around 70% adult population vaccinated end June. also I'd rather live country rich give poor rather country like US poor crock.  would expect every country's leaders worry citizens first. job vaccinating citizens, whole world, that's WHO's job anything.

Also, could've simply destroyed them. Destroying excess product typically-American way deal it. Variants shit.

Florida highest cases B-117 variant state.

Their numbers steadily declining months now.   Tell USA UK. need invest contraceptive- making companies  Sure, grocery store workers potential vectors spread, given many people interact every day. doesn’t make sense put middle-aged people working home front us. Yes, everybody vaccinated. then, they're refusing spread vaccines around (even excess).

Vaccines made EU kept EU intended elsewhere. Honestly vaccinate elderly pretty much done. pretending otherwise Getting first shot tomorrow. happy y’all (and kids) aren’t far behind. 

Going party hard June agree ordered states regard, mean regard. talking completely separate issue.. Georgia long way go get point scenario everyone wants vaccine get one, presumably 75% adult population vaccinated, exactly protecting wearing mask? I'm going wear mask vaccinated protect someone opted get vaccinated, especially I'm already vaccinated reduced chance asymptomatic infection.

Why allowed ask need masks point? What's justification mask requirement situation? justification is, ""Well mask,"" I'm gonna say again, views masks represent views everyone America. fact something many people want proof masks non-zero burden. gonna implement sort inconvenience everyone like that, matter minor think is, need justify need. even stricter measures curb virus.

But: free mental health support everyone needs it. Financial support everyone day one. 

Restriction measures weighted according impact people mental health. Spain example allowed leave house 45 days straight. totally unacceptable. People need allowed go fir walk bike ride.

Certain activities never dangerous never restricted. sport requires one person alone open air environment.

There lot governments could done rather throwing blanket approach it. would require actual thinking part. Lucky. 'lovely' state Maryland republican governor (probs looking 2024 run) opened bars, restaurants, theaters, businesses 100% (""with social distancing""), large outdoor indoor events 50%. Right. Before. St Patrick's Day. expect packed bars restaurants right one booziest, reckless Maryland holidays, variants found state 10% state fully vaccinated, case levels October winter plague gained traction. Fingers crossed populous areas allowed keep restrictions. I'm hoping pessimistic arse wrong, I'm expecting see another spike start two-three weeks, ride reach herd immunity. Weeks! ""COVID STD'S UP! eleven Nooo facts inconvenient!! US done yeah. That's sharing now. 

That's even something proud of, else going access vaccins? Cook soup? Honestly I’ve stopped giving shit, especially since I’m fully vaxxed. wear mask required enforced that’s pretty much it. Large events can’t come back soon enough. I’m throwing mask garbage second mandate dropped state. wasn’t really declared unsafe. People cautious here, looking data. lot people getting seriously ill side effects vaccine.

My mom works nursing home, got vaccinated (together elderly). says residents never fully recovered constantly tired generally person anymore. mom’s upbeat every room every day (logistics).

If data says too, friend nurses getting fucking sick (shaking, “never sick” type comments), mother tells stuff, it’s natural suspicious. already Covid too, like people, breeze get rid of.
I’m exactly eagerly awaiting vaccine right :) 

The rollout should’ve faster general though, agree that. Yes, eventually everyone get it, we're still talking hundred million people becoming eligible around time. Even granting massively ramp capacity, it'll take weeks get everyone wants vaccine. Clear them. want dirty unvaccinated Canadians country.  Yeah know one day parents took doctor said “sorry you’re getting shots today” HPV, didn’t even know HPV time haha.  lining people six feet apart administering vaccines assembly line style probably we’ll month so.

Has anybody called Toyota yet?

Implement Toyota Production System bet we’ll get done half time double precision. promised 100 million 100 days well then, back like early December. WELL hit kind numbers. rate, us hitting 70m vaccinated day 50, looks like humble number first place he's ramping production distribution even inaugurated. one hand, fantastic news. Everyone gets vaccinated. hand, pour one vaccine administrators (pharmacies particular). People become shitheads healthcare workers. ¿Por Que Los Dos?  Thank you! 4 years even Truth Reading article also seem EU problem italian production plans. That's head journalist russian trolls. Stop living fear start driving without seat belt on, it. Yep, works them. Critical thinking skills much lacking them. Though j&amp;j needs 1, number vaccines yes, number people vaccinated no... Good. someone got infected, recovered, still relatively young work home I've long since expected I'm dirt line terms could expect get vaccine. surprisingly sooner date could ever guessed. Masculine? assume mean maskless lol That’s insanely stupid. Everything population based could UK isnt part europe anymore maybe missed something *humans told interact humans year+ negative mental health effect*

Public Health Officials: *shocked pikachu face* J&amp;J doses twice good terms coverage 100 million vaccines matter enough vaccines June 25th, right ya 🥲  Try like 4 years could still fall crack head better wear helmet everywhere walk. risk less negligible, mask vaccinated perfectly reasonable. real difference US UK prepared take additional contractual risk order help distributors scale up. AZ might commissions punchbag here, distributors struggling EU stock. commission common denominator failure, pharma firms. words, mandatory wow! I'm 1c vaccine scheduled next week! Kentucky surprisingly good (thanks beshear) Hi neighbor! wanted let know think autocorrect got says “masculine servers handling food” “maskless” lol It’s personal affects others. risk variants increases. Stupid. I’m pissed never talked mental health impacts earlier

I’ve spent last year told I’m selfish missing friends, outings, socializing, etc. 

To contextualize introverts — imagine year Internet forced socialization 10 hours day. 

It breaks heart think happy time last year. brain fog Good bot deaths associated it? I'm certain *that many deaths* they'd news. 

I remember reading one death-- old person already fragile health died immune reaction shot (you know, thing get fever feel like hell day.) tragic, that's risk average person. side effects I've heard allergic reactions, scary, *dangerous* peanut. take accurate, ended beyond that. ""activists"" like fucking Erin Brockovich got involved too, started ""We *know* yet know *safe* children"" shit. [one - others 

that one earliest widespread case anti-vaccine whackadoodle-ism remember. MMR nonsense. fucking rank mate Florida 100% open winter they’ve trending downward months. ethical get it. Go get now! see Reddit? local boards people talk volunteer opportunities become eligible enter zip code near vaccine station find slot. They’ve moved onto police, teachers, restaurant/bar workers many people hunting appointments.  Pfizer/Biontech delivers promised even delivers bit more. Astra. Late last summer wife run parents drop something them. god forsaken reason, grandparents show visit (turns parents family parties even tell us cause knew would pissed) grandfather actually greets like ""HEY \*COUGH COUGH\* LONG \*COUGH COUGH\* TIME \*COUGH COUGH\* SEE"" joke. wanted kick cane. Today got first shot looking parking lot waited 15 minutes afterward. flags along road like might outside car lot cell phone store said VACCINE seemed surreal. Yeah hate Abott much Texas liberal, agree approach vaccination vs CDC, priority age one risk factor, simple, need prove work someplace. Speed counts now. rollout still really slow, agree targeting age. Keeping things open enforcing mask usage optimal strategy.

If masks work well N95s worn everyone point. year mismanaging badly lost 400k people. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* God I'm ready go lake cousins again. Really missed last summer. Checkout poor schmuck's post history. Dear God. liberal/leftist rag day everyday. even break discuss anything non politics. cannot imagine sad existence would be. Almost 500,000 Americans dead covid Trump kids. Almost 30% Israel's population 0 15, cannot vaccinated. schools reopened person majority kids 0-19 50% new cases heavily skewed 16. 25-30% cases among 20-40 aged population, half full protection.

Moreover, lifting restrictions led lot crowded events general. Without vaccines we'd drownings cases. Take look vid article [street happened 3 week ago.

Lastly, vaccination uniform different demographics, Arabs somewhat antivaxx lower vaccination numbers, led mini outbreak Arab towns cities (they 45% severe cases 18% population).

Still, despite above, cases fallen 8k day 3k (weekly average) still falling. survived. That’s matters. wrong. Studies shown mRNA vaccines 94% effective blocking infection.

Unlike disinformation spreaders say, mean 6% people vaccine get infected. means every 100% people would get infected, number reduced 6%.

If infected, cannot directly infect others. course still indirectly transmit virus go around touching peoples faces rub hands partner’s face, practicing basic hygiene like washing hands drastically reduce chance. betting lot 65+ vaccinated dont want vaccine. lot vaccine hesitantcy rural areas lot older people. least Texas live. Ill keep mine next pandemic, hopefully ain't anytime soon. Wow. amazing. Can’t wait summer never look subreddit 55% SA strain. need boosters since little herd immunity. mom mom's vaccine want it. coworkers talking recently strongly suspected proven vaccine would reduce transmission, advice err side caution act didn't. starting proven now, however.

At point anyone serious suggest would ""100% chance"" transmitting it, literally made shit up. Bartender here. I'm ready make serious fucking money summer. never stopped redditor much this. worked one day vaccine hub local county fucking slow dissapointed. Speed matters now.  whole post making happy left Facebook long ago! It’s 4 years. lost mom state live react god enormous gulf happened vs rest country. believe me, still cannot go back office yet. We've less partial lockdown breaks year now. 

So sense community well aware happens react well try take appropriate measures. anything? already impolite cough sneeze everywhere, COVID-19 time unknown, contagious, airborne contagion known contagious, mutating, airborne contagion plunders ICUs killed Americans world wars Vietnam combined. That's Biden set hard date, similar teachers last week, push holdover states restricting availability. mamy states trying target vaccine perfect way conducive speed. Masks no? Let correct you. leaders reflection DOMINANT CLASS country. Some
Of administration problem might tracking. It’s listed distributed print label. administered till week later Oh great. Another thing governor Iowa fuck up. Congrats! even read whole *headline*, nevermind article. People got sick covid dude. HMG AstraZeneca claim.

The Dutch public broadcaster reports something wedding July. I’m moon right now. wasn’t honest got basically instruction, here’s shot k bye. Yah stop spread getting vaccinated considered serious symptom doesn’t need hospitalization? Yes, many countries need people. Yah fucking sucks. That’s downside lmao might change Inslee's announcement today. Outdoor venues permanent seating open 25% capacity. would 12,000 fans. huge difference, could see raising max allowed. really hope COVID vaccine rollout helps illuminate ridiculous anti-vaccine movement point sort fades away nothingness found out, like yeah one things. Y’all heros. made appointments immediate fam otherwise vaccine pusher sending links updates extras friends. takes normal people giving damn change world thank service! def city wide fireworks shows lmao Forcing developing countries subservience predatory economics good? can’t “let people” anything. like Biden voted don’t like wording letting people things homes know? Like invite someone over, know accepting risks. RIP DMs Even says initial agreement struck June. means nonsense say EU sort supply chain November. Meanwhile go look thau UK finalised UK supply chain. find Wrexham plant agreement finalised November either. never said none experts better.

But experts same. Plenty people PhD given subject yet considered idiots peers. It’s certainly thing field.

Some experts better others.

Dr Fauci example seams much better guy advised Swedish government. remember grandmother mom's side, survivor cervical cancer, HPV vaccine might make teenage girls think safe premarital sex. 

Nevermind fact grandmother may waited marriage stayed faithful grandfather, grandfather womanizer cheated constantly. Hence cervical cancer ended with, resulting hysterectomy. can't even bizzaro religious logic. Nah, actually sex education use birth control condoms. I'm busting everywhere come June lot regulars anti-mitigation subs molded group via knowing better thinking must really mainstream opinion get downvoted negative responses sub repeating anti-mitigation talking points. also, understandably people want get back pre-pandemic life asap erring towards optimism pessimism, opposite used be. I'm latter also agreement anti-mitigation crowd attack exaggerations. Yeah unless you’re agoraphobic nutcase, gatherings become thing past neither indoor dining. That’s huge thing miss plan soon feel safely can. all, state government completely fucking big cities preventing putting restrictions. really say ""Texas"" thing, even inside Texas places completely open anyone eho wants vaccine like Hardin, Jasper, Orange Beaumont. Might localizaded part state. Yes. continue pay company’s deductible insurance premiums cost much mortgages. 


Part team works us.  cost pay healthcare atrocious even insurances.  dr. network? Sorry pay that. It’s hot garbage. 

Sure hospitals run limpoma removed shoulder 6 months snd cost 12$ parking.  see dr monthly follow ups adhd medication. 0$. kids go month adhd medication follow (while dosing sorted out) 0$. visits kids stiches 0$. thing might take long hip knee surgeries older patients. cap number keep costs down. heart attack treated immediately. 

Most hospitals go newly renovated updated. hospitals delivering healthcare making money.

If don’t like free healthcare welcome go back us deal fallout. 

The idea Canada doesn’t anything R&amp;D ridiculous. level 4 lab city infectious disease. universities also cutting edge research development also bleeding students dry requiring 10 thousands dollars student loans. Sure us better aspect, Heath care one Next, sign order insuring sun rise tomorrow morning. going thru postponing wedding next year want know everyones thoughts possibly wedding June July year (for 150 people)? could possibly wedding year, thrilled. would still bummer still postpone next year. Thoughts???? that? thought wasn’t safe die around unvaccinated. seem missed reality ango propaganda dominance. spin everything eay want since medias read ones world. It’s eligible. Make mistake many people still won’t fully vaccinated July August. downer realistic.   Oh wow! September 2020! time alive was. Oh god, thank you. Take vitamin C Zinc, stay active, sleep front. fine, probably. fail college, taking rigorous courses C’s D’s, transitioned online format made deans list. coworkers saying vaccines nothing mitigate transmission basically exposed covid say a. 100% chance bringing home unvaccinated partner.

That’s understanding kind contrary got vaccinated. Anyone care explain? IOWA CITY, Iowa (KCRG) -An Iowa City web developer using skills help Iowans find COVID-19 vaccine appointments open real-time.

When Brian Finley became eligible vaccine Monday, learned exactly difficult get appointment. decided use programming skills use data local pharmacies put information one place- Twitter. “I eligible several close family were, think experience lot people far frustrated. Constantly refreshing trying find vaccine appointment,” says Finley.

The account, @IAVaccineAlerts, gives updates real-time appointments Hy-Vee, Walgreens, CVS locations across Iowa. ""smallpox polio never killed anyone bruh""

That's appointments Ridgefield.  could see (or allies) trying play favorites vaccine supply. company AZ, EU supposed faults.

It never happen since brits heavely overrepresented here. biden far gone dementia know way up. That’s put bed 7pm every night. Anyone ever cared someone mental decline due age/dementia knows later worse confusion gets. UK media barely mentioned sudden change heart

for second thought written ""the U.S. media"". like ""well hell, last April every American sense God gave goose shitting pants things going NYC"" working home 9 years COVID hit, aside minor issues, professional life really change. I'm lucky regard.

I saw reports panic buying Asia figured wife stock well. remember walking Costco first lockdowns California seeing people quietly stocking too. 

When stay place orders announced, felt like world turned upside down. went get groceries, streets eerily quiet compared before.

My wife saw wider adoption WFH forced pandemic decided buy house. closed July 2020. probably biggest change lives, again, feel lucky ot this.

We homebodies even COVID, perfectly happy stay home. I'll say we're looking forward getting vaccine leaving house often, though.

My opinion people general worsened COVID. remember, moving middle pandemic California's wildfire season, seeing maskless people sitting outside Starbucks. blew mind people determined wear masks would risk disease also breath wildfire smoke. 

In short, made okay, mostly big disruption daily life. Again, feel fortunate, I'm grateful people making stay home stay safe. seems basically anytime government calls heroes chuckling thinking ""I'm danger.""

9/11 first responders

Iraq, Afghanistan veterans

Frontline healthcare workers

And essential retail workers well.

Is even one example group labeled ""heroes"" government and/or mainstream media, gotten anything shaft? Ugh us single people it’s shitty ex never go away 🙄 dad got vaccine thought side effects that. Turns got covid around time. Thankfully much better now. bedridden good 3 days got taste back day 5. sure role (if any) vaccine played that. Vaccine transmission risk question. 

Background: 
So I’m weeks, partner going visit parents. dad fully vaccinated mom either fully vaccinated gotten second dose visit. (No cannot reschedule.) partner can’t get vaccine yet due state restrictions. unvaccinated brother may may parents even he’s go visit fairly often. 

My actual question; risk partner getting covid? likely parents could transmit even brother isn’t assuming covid?

My whole workplace saying nothing changed got vaccinated basically transmit bad wasn’t vaccinated.  believe medical license give shot, nurses, doctors, pharmacists etc. Right don’t think issue giving shots, it’s vaccine availability. It’s ramping up, think shipments generally used week following distribution states. know cancel vaccination clinics town last week due lack vaccines. expect bottleneck move vaccines administration coming weeks. announced part partnership Inclusive Vaccines Alliance France, Germany, Italy Netherlands EU took negotiation everything slowed down. Novasep deal signed November.  did, seem idea means apply it. article concerning covid deaths recorded England July 2020.

I'm 43 pneumonia twice within one calendar year, recently Feb 2020. got Pneumonia vaccine summer (after badgering PCP). Glad now. studies show superior immunity variants generated infections compared vaccination?

Average antibody titers better vaccination sure, there's risk severe disease spread vaccine.

Asking long term data vaccine disease that's humans 2 years reasonable. said, know side effects already. Stop living fear masks facts vaccines none 100% effective work herd immunity probability. several related degrees personally done vaccine research.

Work listening interacting good faith. Oh boy... I'm glad restrictions lifted people continue harass healthcare workers, longer neighbor eligible them, come give x shots per hour. bottleneck level administration. ratio people give shots people need shots staggering. J&amp;J vaccine getting EU approval, we'll start seeing mass vaccination events, jeez please nice healthcare workers tell can't give shot right moment. We're team, trying best momentous task we've given. people crap job spreading actual recommended amount skin. Like said current rate. doses come online, especially J&amp;J next month could really hit 40% March 60% May 1, could even more. Biden declared open vaccine availability May 1 states it’s looking like April. Good stuff.  Interesting, thanks. Yellow Card system self-reported means causal links established. we've already seen released AZ contract, specific buyers bought specific locations. makes sense, companies charge different amounts based costs incurred producing vaccines. example, UK paid twice much per dose compared EU AZ vaccines, likewise vaccines. Hence why, despite EU moaning bunch, UK sending AZ vaccine supply. US also paid per dose.

In Pfizer case mention, clearly EU purchased vaccines produced US factories. least none US order filled. So, no, contractual right vaccines. really, there’s nothing stopping employer requiring employee certain vaccinations right now. 

It’s also pretty common international travel countries require specific vaccinations entering. Yay.... oddly though lot dying going Brazil would end lot sooner complacency see everywhere would stop. may fourth quarter want skip overtime need keep guard up. notes:

I’d like government stop blocking export ***vaccine you’re even using***. It’s crazy want that.  California think it’s still technically illegal. know work variants. approved vaccines stated protect variants. work schools I’m around people too. I’m sure plenty coworkers aren’t vaccinated I’m proposing lose jobs since way work remotely. Seriously, exercising outside what's kept sane whole time. I've heard places offer people store calling waitlist since worry waitlist person actually making store. might try showing hour last scheduled vaccination asking then.  like 3 hours point: there's huge discrepancy they're measuring different things. One measuring reduction total transmission person x (Israel); measuring reduction transmission person (this study).

That's trying understand. Thanks. 1.7x population Denmark, would slightly 1 million doses anti-vaxxer black?

Seriously? inb4 ""they find new job"" immediately get job moment quit ability travel employer still keeps restrictions place Denmark 6 million people Isn’t likely blood clots result disease?

Seriously. took vax ""virus"" 99.7% survival rate less year trial insist others take it? something REALLY wrong ilk. situation proposing, seem vaccine stops transmission, B would able pass even vaccinated, fact they'd probably likely would lesser symptoms likely come work.

Now reality I'm sure know vaccine affects transmission yet. kept covid news apart daily tallies maybe new information. I'm vaccine I'm sure full mandate appropriate data. Wait, suggesting get infected Corona prevent getting infected Corona? I'm assuming United States. Visit outdoors wear mask. vaccine 100% effective new variants there. rates much lower, relatively safe visit indoors without mask.

The US went sociopathic route normalized high infection rates, let normalize you. Infection rates still worse May never controlled US. lucky, large enough percentage people vaccinated months much less worry about. must live open state might vaccinated already young, lol. Interesting, Brazil, Sinovac vaccine coronavac costs 10.30 dollars dose.  
Government talking also buy Sinopharm (same article), let's see price paid Hungary. attempt source radical estimate ""practically everybody"" yielded results 10-30% scientific studies. Infection rates estimated 4-8 times official rates.

My overall point stands, pandemic fully taken advantage elites.

Personally, antibody test turns infected fully recovered covid without noticing. banned travel bad offices get vaccine? understand people's scepticism reluctance comply. No, without Sanofi EU would bought Pfizer. introvert, definitely me. even get super anxious increased interaction. level in-person, see substitute meet anyone's socialization needs. definitely _form_ socialization, inadequate one extroverts Yeah dumb, acting like lots people already small gatherings family Thanksgiving Christmas? body choice strictly followed recommended policy beginning still year later.

How? virus disappeared like that. best less deaths cases would go soon reopen. Unless truly believe ""true lcokdown"" 100% compliance (whatever means) could eradicated virus entirely country. literally impossible even assuming somehow managed that, still keep country closed rest world.

Realistically, timeline always going dependent vaccines, people's compliance. insane sounds, depends counting visible numbers are. US nearly 8,000+ die day well 2 million die year average. boomers age continue rise. think many us view death happens “to families extended old relatives” case, inevitable living beings. relationship dead dictate feel. real issue unvaccinated people chance virus mutate avoid vaccine. 

In vax person virus can’t multiply nearly much way less chance mutations. 

Plus vaccine won’t end working everyone barriers vaccinated people around better. hell headline mean? absolutely reason people saying COVID without getting tested.

Let's say mother family 4 gets COVID. gets tested positive. family gets sick get tested. almost sure bet COVID, despite getting test. US complaining EU isn’t vaccines. want ban exports? Go ahead. US doesn’t care. protection isn’t 100% none accurate word moment unless something changes. There’s 5%+ chance infection. That’s even small enough statistically irrelevant. 

Also, multiple variants flying around adds element hasn’t even tested yet. personally it’s worth risk. Go visit keep distanced, wear mask. OP also coworkers works public regular basis. It’d different could keep pretty quarantined job raises chances. 

I totally get I’m boat. Unfortunately due working public coworkers I’d rather person bring something work even chances 5%  side effects people worry things wouldn’t see years

This literally never happened vaccine. rare side effects ever happened apparent quickly. Nothing ever taken years show I'll go bat people, unthinkingly grocery store realized stupid was. Natural instinct sometimes takes logic. Thankfully never since, still need override impulse so. dumb - monitor health 1000s people, going get health complications die numerous reasons. causal relationship vaccine blood clots. People get blood clots. Especially older people, knew! website looks like absolute shitshow scare tactics. Would recommend. yeah meanwhile UK said we're fully open June 21. small gatherings close family ain't going fly people going say fuck guidelines. should. encourage anyone get vaccine they're fence also told barely anything going reopen July 4th lol. Agreed, I'm saying dumb taking job negotiating higher wage right happy collecting unemployment. south, yes. chance west coast. Even fans allowed.  maybe ship immunocompromised person live medical isolation rest lives get small jab arm.

Personally can't wait come head identify remove selfish people life put personal beliefs health overs. really shocking scary pandemic like stripped away niceties artifice.. really exposed people's motivations behavior truly is. (didn't help layered top (and immediately after) divisive years social unrest). 

But yeah.. really vaporizes trust hope people. I'm much MUCH ""stand offish"" strangers relationships before. Someone go ""above beyond"" really prove ethics personality I'll even give modicum chance now. (and even then. I'll still silently planning 2 3 different ""alternate paths"" backup options). Right, bit relief grocery store get quite much anxiety near senior citizens there. personally might much danger earlier pandemic, carry weight world around much. even aware country months? family small gatherings (6-7 people) Thanksgiving Christmas one got sick. they’re normally pretty stringent followers restrictions. Without AZ would bought Pfizer-Biontech. edit: pick sarcasm 11 million people vaccinated UK issues. fine. animals het horribly sick humans fair decide keep zoos look best can. Fair enough question said anything like countries cannot say moment whether would legal illegal,” European Commission spokesman said proposal. “The question legality depends case spokesman said move could involve shipping “unauthorised products” Ireland could rely one derogations legislation allows use unauthorised medicines would depend situation point time [FOR EXAMPLE], scarcity regard product authorised EU,” said.

The vaccines us get regularly relatively old; they've around ages understand effectiveness well side effects. new covid vaccines use innovative technology are, comparison, relatively unproven. developed record time.

The scientists also can't give us hundred percent guarantee work exactly long offer protection. 

I going take vaccine, even uncertainties. encourage others so. collective leap faith we're taking. Please, dude. Get creepy cult run fast can. Check sources information told hate.

Exported 20m doses March alone, much total.

And please consider AZ ""managed"" deliver ~15m doses quarter. No, don't. vaccine belong paid them.

The vaccines produced EU bought numerous sources inside outwith EU.

It's really complex - buy something, it. addition aforementioned extra orders countries used, Denmark least using maximum doses vials beginning. also report part extra doses vaccine schedule. got funny videos. thought again, worries me: able measure risk taking vaccine

That's incorrect. able measure risk, exceedingly low compared infection. like vaccine. know side effects mRNA vaccines given EUA. They've millions people multiple months.

Again, side effects, know them.  came would likely start another pandemic 😆 Pascal Soriot admitted did, front EP. outside political optics

You're unlikely get many answers then. shitty Republican T\*\*\*\* supporting govenor good shape! agree. get hard you. data going lag behind couple weeks decisions made based data doubt, partially ignorant morons pushing things happen quicker.

Remember every one Biden's COVID announcements designed distract unfettered military, shrunk $2,000 stimulus checks, every promise campaigned dropped ignored starting January 21. isn’t true. zero evidence doses earmarked EU used elsewhere. Yeah that'd bad argument. Help understand. Can’t argue getting vaccine you’re forcing virus mutate? 

And doesn’t vaccine prevent getting spreading? 

I’m serious help understand don’t mind please. That’s fair. searching looks like moderna similar youth trials. expecting results summer. Since two potential options them, I’m less concerned supply issues. doses hand inventory adults though I’m ok exporting doses we’re contracted for. Sure, vaccines EU belong EU.

But would big problem that, right? Sweden expecting 1,8 million AZ doses Q2, we’re 2x population Denmark. 1 million doses Denmark sounds high. 900,000 seems realistic. seems like issue unique Texas, stores urban suburban areas Florida, Arizona, Georgia, Tennessee issue.

Yes gonna trouble enforcing mask mandate rural Texas, issue existed mask mandate lifted. so? cases drop everyone get vaccine, thats end it. thats people take.

Probably less 500,000, certainly less millions hospitalized, probably less hundreds thousands millions long term health issues covid. It’s major issue sure one addressed actual economic relief reason restrictions lockdowns necessary. Would seem odd get shot today 6 months later need another one... That's works. vaccines belong AZ, belong US gov. get decide go. Well, countries buying Pfizer vaccines countries opted expensive stuff. 

There transparency deals (therefore called bazaar Kurz EU officials). 

Otherwise Austria would still top receiving countries (we bought Pfizer stuff opted Moderna doses due Q3/Q4) reminds morbid bets refuse collect. last week feb last year bet friend would deaths covid flu, well passed called ask wanted double nothing would hit 100k, said yes. passed that, told we'd double end year, yeah....no way gonna take money fact rare moment last year could even think downhill slope, we'd passed halfway point thing quickest inquiry ever what? :D

posted 4 minutes earlier: Yeah - can't afford let become another dividing line. don’t think ending mask mandate good idea, it’s mask ban all. Businesses absolutely enforce mask mandates—they refuse service. That's thing, likely convince people stop kids, even less likely convince scientists etc attempt create vaccination let's say, future disease even worse covid ends killing kids (for example).

I got first dose 12/31 second dose 1/24 risk spreading?

We know virus unlikely spread outdoors.

We know vaccines extremely effective.

We know vaccines reduce risk asymptomatic spread.

We know every American wants vaccine able get one summer.

If that's enough remove mask requirements, enough? think can't remove mask mandates COVID completely eradicated, might well say we'll never remove mask mandates. exported what, like 20 million doses? Indian facility produced like 10x already Doesn’t matter I’m still get Smart move indeed.

I personally think Biden announcing early boost morale, reality still huge amount first at-risk groups (front line healthcare workers, elderly, etc.) still waiting US... That’s fucking awesome. saw weeks ago 30 would July, May 1st fantastic Probably could 150 people vaccinated manufacturing issues.

You mean SII, world's largest manufacturer vaccines fucked badly know, ended fixing one major issues vaccines.

Yeah sounds real enough Yes society this, well 60%. concerned ""saving lives"" mostly ignoring and/or accepting fall out. thing happened work. Last February, ""pneumonia"" ripped got 75% employees sick. Severity varied person person. 2 older, weight, people got hospitalized. None kids got sick. test anyone covid. death investigated linked condition, according Madsen:  completely different condition death reported Denmark.

Looks like due blood clot, somewhat reassuring least. STAY IMPRISONED FOREVER. election loss still really guys bummed out, huh? everyone eligible vaccine May, estimates calculations long it’ll take long it’ll take vaccinate everyone?

I imagine it’ll shit show trying book appointment unless walk ins lines around block something. don’t think PR much lower level now, I’ll stick absolutely nothing lose. batch used suspicious cases? J&amp;J doses come back ""fill&amp;finish"" US late May/early June.

You quote later. Thank much president Biden hard work grit, helping american people get back track. 3 months Poland. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Indeed. Spanish source: Huge news This. there’s testing done possible long term effects vaccine, let older adults get it. Unless course underlying condition, case probably get it.  Maybe also say fuvk rest world ban exports? AZ going magically deliver 18 million doses next two weeks. hit 30 million target, best given current delivery trends hit around 17 18 million. lol wont I'm going defend it. racist order. Still 100x better limiting freedom people way. Inform public real risk different people, let make informed decision based statistics. old, might advised stay home. stay-at-home orders curfews definietely wrong way it. business, case lockdown, gov subsidize costs business stays afloat. gov this, fuck regulations. Providing food kids important getting covid. keep safe anymore, scared, stay fuck home something, force hysteria others.  really. Compared Chinese Russian deliveries, way behind. Apart point, doses also come EU like British. accepted managerial position black days June-august - party me!  Well need things return normal. past year destroyed certain sectors economy little government help. 

Hopefully time everyone gets fair chance take vaccine become immune fully open. vaccine freely available Russia without big queues, many people want get vaccinated. parents fully vaccinated. intend hardcore distance rest year, including seeing family, medical visits, going grocery shopping, they’re afraid variants. 

It’s honestly really mentally crushing too. don’t know we’ll feel safe together family again. government jumped forced order prove Great Britain mess, went amateurs. second part comment key. think actually best. problem ""best"" quite disappointing... Obviously Easter 2022. already watched ""Back future"" summer daughter great (I small tv, helps make huge gap experience). 8 people. hope cinemas carry programming good oldies. EU member states didn’t join program? 🐑🐑🐑🐑 I’m worried long hauler symptoms. Got whole year getting covid tested positive Monday. Ugh. Italy people panicking person died retired one batch AZ investigate matter. took shot anyway experience far positive. zero symptoms, except mild pain arm (17h in). I'm afraid whole thing going slow vaccinations, nobody needs that. Congrats getting vax Seems clear smear campaign astrazenica. 

I mean jabs making profit *cough American pharma* sure would like see cheap alternative demand get hurt. 

What's next....... Blame AZ that, EU. export stopped AZ fulfilling contractual obligations *where exporting from* 80%. AZ sell can't provide. difference make even vaccines elderly risk. predict states would drop mandates summer, reinstate winter (not lockdowns, masks/capacity limits), 2022, finally go back normal good(except maybe California). mom same. threatened visit person anymore went got employer. massacre? even read article?

""The protests started April 15 [1989] forcibly suppressed June 4 government declared martial law sent People's Liberation Army occupy parts central Beijing. Estimates death toll vary several hundred several thousand, thousands wounded.""

You sound like *agent provocateur* me, I've got time you. **blocked**  foreigners country, way threat Koreans (or natives anywhere, really?)

You make argument statistical geographic level looking people live dormitories, etc., ""Koreans safe, foreigners dangerous"" argument makes uncomfortable. Poland, even better comes education! xD

this year education widely known worthless

year teachers went nearly monthly strike

and two years ago teachers also monthly strike 

we're raising people close access education really think that's case, think people far quick stereotype. 

While I'm expert Pakistan, *am* currently *in* Pakistan. Putting vaccination conspiracy theories side, great many people simply believe coronavirus exists, threat worth worrying over. several strangers ask whether think COVID-19 real, others make statements along lines of, ""Allah protects us illness. decides time, time."" 

Putting experience aside, think worth noting CIA use vaccination campaigns try obtain Osama bin Laden's DNA.

Temporarily discounting Islamist angle--how think average American would react found government harvesting DNA part intelligence program? That's exactly anti-vaxxers afraid (along microchips assorted nonsense), it'd likely make anti-vaxxerism mainstream movement. 

Furthermore, terror groups actively targeted killed people pushing vaccination campaigns Osama bin Laden's death. 

People want take vaccination want take many reasons conservative Westerners. people live terror-influenced areas--of far less Pakistan Reddit seems think--may face local influences inherently anti-vaccination fear personal, political consequences allowing ""strangers"" access local homes. says explicitly, UK article January, citing UK task force, initial UK j bbs produced EU. insist UK manufacturing online earlier EU manufacturing light quote? closing society saving lives, great social remodeling.

If reason closing society save lives, vaccines instead - jumping gun open enough population vaccinated.

(You certainly make argument we're yet, anyone thinks lockdown *per se* good thing get sea). Enough half EU. Gene transfer two strains = WPRSE COVID


omfg, Brazil... embarrassing America wind vaccine people willing get vaccinated- good.
The polls better, there's hard core anti-vaxxers millions.... Additionally Americans: feel like rush get vaccinated meet state's eligibility tier yet. patience.

The point suppressive measures got R rate Covid something similar flu. would mean case numbers probably also broadly similar. 

For reason, actual risk child (once infected) similar. might see larger numbers children infected - again, adults universally vaccinated, also see much lower R rate children otherwise would. Restaurant workers eligible since early February NY. Calm definetly mask mandate

True. Though almost entirely policed corporate America.

Even inland CA, mask wearing seriously kick Walmart Home Depot said one day, ""thou shalt wear mask, shop here"" actually enforced it. Well, could take Tylenol strong coffee tough out, would isn’t alternative. (Best case, people afraid COVID.) 

I would call early possible let know got bad flu symptoms vaccine, don’t need COVID test anything, you’re going need day work doesn’t suffer. place worth salt, understanding kind thing. Probably nothing much, need trials confirm this. lack urgency people getting kids back school, properly educated, disappointing. Remote learning joke many kids every day actual class counts.  Yeah, sure, let's wait EU approval (of vaccine already authorized 40 countries given millions people) even starting set production. like hurry, right? like matters EU general, Italy particular (a country significant weight tourism economy), get vaccines weeks/months earlier later, people return normal earlier later.

Well done, EU. Honestly always super pro-EU since age understand politics, defended EU good bad times, seem really bent destroying support citizens. hard support entity cares political posturing making clear good guys Russia evil actually saving lives giving us lifes economies back sooner. taxes

The minute $1,400 clears, I'm jumping IRS.gov pay (plus bit more) right back.

Anyone want guess happens say get Johnson Johnson near term available, road want another booster? wonder happen mix match. Yes, definitely possible. Many places operating certain days week on. 1 million day optimistic (great true!) 4.5-6 million thrown around, 4.5 gvt's pessimistic projection.  halo losing shine lately, even around here. think actually better many colleagues comes relentless fearmongering attempts control policy narrative - consequences - damned - worship getting Trump still around outrageous. Offering everyone Oct 21 = restrictions lifted Christmas. read whole comment relate parts it. Sounds like even though you’re older kid, lot growing (and good way past year). 

I felt similarly part gone. plan use put towards self improvement growth carefree innocence point lost powerlessness permeated existence months end. 

It’s hard explain it’s heavy. Tomorrow gonna rough. worth it. Across England nearly 75% 93% care home residents vaccination. guess London figures (59.9% care home staff) comparison high rates groups. I’m quite there, thinking planning fun hope I’ll get soon, I’m getting
Closer every day. July 10th wedding here! actually pretty damn cool him. one week, delivered 5% less plausible reason given, caught later. even offering four million doses promised first quarter.

Astra comparison, first slashed target 100 million 80 million, 40 million, 31 million revised political pressure back 40 million regularly misses deliveries. Last week Poland, week Denmark on.... Heading Miami type this. Spring break!!!

Others free double mask July 4th hang friends backyard like Fauci approves. right expection AZ 30M Q1 70M Q2. 200 million doses less end June written contract. Absolutely abysmal. seen people behaving past year? last thousand years?

I'm big proponent aliens glassing entire planet. least nice little marble look distance. Don’t feel guilty. Feel thankful, blessed, lucky. entire campaign already 6 months behind first world countries. Another month means another load deaths long voluntary forced thing, sounds pretty good me. need examples? :P Got second shot yesterday. Went home work early felt lightheaded dizzy. Woke morning (1am) feel like absolute shit. Body aches, low grade fever, thirsty, cold point can't get warm. I've always strong reaction flu vaccine I'm surprised 100% would worth spread higher risk family members. shit feel like crap.

The B117, P1, B1351 variants particular. Along variants concern may emerge future result premature reopening. 

Happy? Lol, EU. sent developing nations, rich incompetent morons People live places like Syria face life-changing events frequently; Americans simply avoid information worse, process ""how affect ME?"" lens.

Enjoy lockdowns Europe. 

Meanwhile countries acting like babies trying scaremonger AZ vaccines back pubs shortly. week March 15? Restrict like parents refuse vaccinate kids schools suspend do. Yeah, take warfarin (in injections) terrible. sound much worse though! Wish much luck. not. Americans, pandemic already ended ago.

This going heavily dependent geographic location, socioeconomic status, education level, political leanings. Saying ""most"" probably overstating it. Vaccinated people’s immune systems respond vaccine. leads symptoms associate sick, it’s response body makes defeating pathogen, response vaccine, instead pathogen. That’s entirely expected, extent workplace populations immunized stagger slightly rather immunize everyone day, leading one come work they’re expected immune responses once, like example. That’s poor planning, surprise, evidence anything nefarious. two healthcare workers family reported staggered rollouts.  
 
What else got? It’s literally profession. quit work Wendy’s. Right private business within rights allow Obviously don’t get $100k starting out, especially bigger cities, $15 bare minimum live. Remember federal minimum wage still $7.25/hour. everyone else said, order herd immunity exist work certain percentage population vaccine. Unfortunately, it’s quite individual “if everyone who’s immune compromised gets they’re safe”. aren’t safe *they* got vaccine. safe community herd immunity new (and sometimes worse) strains don’t emerge. one new strains could potentially vaccine resistant. 

Most people vaccine gotten measles polio vaccine don’t see widespread others like flu lot people get vaccinated don’t get plethora reasons. Hope made sense :// Anyone holds opinion americans vaccinated covid 19 restricted activities vaccinated people otherwise participate in, severely beaten cease espouse said opinion. think it’s antibodies give immunity don’t last forever. see would feel less urgency get vaccinated right now, point won’t benefit natural antibodies. And, like others mentioned, virus circulates amongst unvaccinated, mutate could render vaccines useless. wish could casual endangering others. Seems like carefree life. Today marks year since Cuomo shut performing arts venues NYC, time four weeks. someone working live events time, that’s reality covid hit me, think. They're sceptical country general.

Russia interesting mix extreme patriotism extreme mistrust people actually power country. exists US extent, seems much prominent Russia. yet still perfectly fine. take vaccine even fine! That's do!!!

I personally want leave company love it, times (especially around holidays) suuuuuper burned get hardly anything done even tho ton I'm running think bit behind schedule myself. sucks didnt wanna like yo I'm struggling mentally know still need work. 

I feel like every new thing extra piled urgent automatically stressed puts bad mood immediately. sucks! get card CDC get vaccinated, everyone who's vaccinated already card Republicans: makes perfect rational sense even compassion core, it’s popular. naturally we’re it. it, even idea must conspiracy mythology behind it, written 5 year old edited horny 15 year old. Why?  I’ve never seen 6 month lpn program, that’s scary Appreciate input! I'm unique case myself. used take warfarin years ago ended multiple occurrences coughing massive amounts blood (a previous PE likely help either). best doctors country idea do, concluded try something else. ended taking Lovenox long term. There's risks osteoporosis meant long term use, take calcium every day counter it. shots abdomen suck ass though, careful inject right get huge bruises hematomas. There's INR worry generally I've real stable it. Since I'm 'normal' clot sufferers, still worry vaccine react me. However either catch Covid know 100% without doubt kill me, choice hard lol.

Glad thinners though! really suck kind accident fall (I ended surgery months wound healing/rehab stupid fall drunk, I'm late 30s!) Employer mad employees publicly criticized them, chooses renew contracts. Truly shocking unprecedented. /s RN’s, though. type nurse, one slightly education. many lawyers taking cases pro bono

How think flu spreads? Colds? respiratory infection? easier mark tattoo? seriousness, 56% said unvaccinated allowed work home. Seems like would encourage people stay unvaccinated. addition, experts claiming spreading still possible vaccination. one nature's answers overpopulation species.

It's helpful personify nature way. Viruses possible whenever members certain species close enough infect other. directly result overpopulation. Humanity stricken lots deadly viruses past, well reached point could consider us ""overpopulated"". 

Viruses product society, reason spread well globally interconnected nature society. 

There absolutely reason think plague virus necessary keep population controllable level. 

People screaming overpopulation threat decades now, reality never reached point even close existential threat. problems come polluting planet, inequitable distribution resources. reality plentiful renewable energy available, plentiful resources available planet us continue species quite long smart it. 

In fact, trend among wealthier nations birth rate naturally declines. Perhaps spent time spreading around resources equitably, nations high birth rates slow reproduction well. speaking differences BSN ADN Fred Meyer QFC grocery list next round groceries. Well vaccines apply EMA approval so. Sputnik probably approved stage (although doubts EU buy significant quantities since probably looking like Q3 produce some) seen Chinese ones making noise approval  want get 2 kids (both 12 yrs old) vaccinated asap. tell won’t available 2022 earliest.

I wonder travel restricted to, say 15 year old (assuming 16+ get vaccines foreseeable future) Can't argue research, attack me, got it. Good day you. I’m tearing reading thread right now. many us end you’re 100% right really ambitious. 1m day took office. Even families divided based this.

Lmao immune system boost. think vaccines actually do? apply restriction people person choice get shot. can't tell someone can't work choice get vaccine. choice say suppose that's different conversation. hate posts like this. concerts, fans baseball games, everyone wearing masks grocery stores. pandemic still real. actually that, based weeks deliveries (updated yesterday MGen Fortin's Federal Vaccine Rollout video -  Canada's vaccine rollout deliveres - Week March 22nd - 2,040,570 doses (1.2M Pfizer, 850K Moderna)
* Week March 29th - 1,194,570 doses (all Pfizer)
* Week April 5th - \~1,874,070 doses (1M Pfizer, \~855K Moderna)
* Week April 12th - 1,019,070 doses (all Pfizer)
* Week April 19th - 2M doses (\~1M Pfizer, \~1M Moderna)

Total: 10M doses March 22nd April 25th

After known schedule, OP's link says 1M Pfizer doses May 10th would another 2M doses schedule. Oxford scheduled deliver 500K doses mid May. Moderna ramp shipments reach targeted 12.2M doses Q2 (they need least double April shipments reach goal).

I’m sure soon confirm vaccines stop mostly stop transmission

I’m doubting you, I’ve looking info don't. left supports idea. right not. Yeah 70% adult population. Many recently vaccinated community reacted large number severe cases among them, going take couple week protection catch up. Quite clickbaity headline. indications studies completed UK variant little difference resistance comparison 'original' variant.

The updated vaccine South African variant, two different pieces information included headline without punctuation reason. ignoring fact different countries different population sizes genuinely stupid? Lets take US example since seem pretty close-minded. 500,000 people- 0.0015% US population, died past year Covid listed cause death. 655,000 people also die EVERY YEAR heart disease. That’s higher number isn’t it? aren’t targeting heart disease then? stop foods packed things lead heart disease? all, it’s significantly avoidable illness; change diet put body. let’s real here- don’t actually care saving amount human lives, care narrative right feeling morally superior disagree you. indeed essential. I'm thrilled good folks do. finally able get covid vax PA. used findashot.org compile open appointments one site. still fight them, least see ones aim for. Also, covid vaccine hunters pa facebook great resource.

the sad thing rite aid recently (this week) shut appointments 1a's vaccinating teachers. agree teachers need vaccinated, elderly immune-compromised. wait maybe give AZ clearance. dump vaccine delivering system.

Meanwhile doses could stop dying somewhere else world. USA pure definition vaccine nationalism. already vaccinations need next months storage it’s piling more.
Yeah you’re right, would want family vaccinated first, sometimes it’s want, it’s right thing supporting others pandemic that’s affecting whole world.

Most UK's vaccines mid-February actually Pfizer, AZ. AZ let UK too. Oh I'm well aware. Personally, can't wait till Pharmacists replaced vending machines. 

In seriousness days local pharmacist numbered. little reason COMMON medications like amoxycillin stored pre-packaged right prescribing doctor's offices. rise things like Amazon pharmacy, also less need use local pharmacy recurring prescriptions well. 

The time go local pharmacy urgent need get prescription, need go minute clinic type thing routine vaccination. Don’t worry guys it’s like 0.25 mg, cbd oil can’t.

UK poured money Novavax, paid production facilities, clinical trial citizens. think UK priority is, reality, tiny production capacity. Meanwhile.. USA sitting 30 million doses. yeah EU bad. Pathetic noted, 30 million AZ doses sitting American warehouses. 

The US government allow vaccines administrated, exported. sit fridge somewhere, waiting expiration date. anyone know going Europe?

He fuck right empty sympathy. back forth bullshit. That’s science, that’s straight knowing he’s talking about. I’m actually shocked grateful hear Biden say SOMEWHAT end game gatherings could resume July. every American start get vaccines May 1st. don’t love Biden, even GE better Fauci. honestly hope trolling, otherwise feel sorry you.

* We've people running around refusing small piece cloth face statistically going die (just old/at risk people might come contact with). 
* We've governments lying citizens potential cures blocking relief vaccine rollouts political gain. 
* We've people manipulating mask mandates either increased tourism political gain.
* We've massive bailouts large business almost zero help small businesses.
* We've churches still keeping open, people (who apparently ""love thy neighbour"") giving shit giving thy neighbour covid.
* We've people buying cleaning supplies (and toilet paper) order resell ebay 100x price.
* We've people blocking COVID testing political reasons.
* still people giving shit COVID protocols inside stores restaurants.
* We've countries blocking shipments medical goods countries need.  
* We've people going fucking vacation middle global pandemic got ""burned out."" 
* We've rich people buying ventilators flying/attempting fly foreign countries escape (and spread) virus. 

And I'm sure things I'm forgetting. excusable people knowledge base understand, people brainwashed religion/political party. However, certain point, really hard face facts lot people assholes. Assholes always assholes regardless education opportunities. People probably gonna drop infection rates really plummet irrational fearmongering. There's actual rational mechanism another surge happen time frame (aside 1 million events). 

We still follow restrictions, especially vaccinated, even vaccinated effect appearances, months. that's stop surge, that's stop deaths severe cases. quite literally 20 articles citing research explains exactly science you’re wrong. Antibodies natural infection antibodies vaccine same. sound straight uninformed. got first dose I’m definitely happy don’t think I’ll feel “back normal” people get vaccine hopefully soon! Lol funny, that's kinda assume people still hysterically clinging masks trying demand everyone continue ""mask up."" one like showing face lol. Personally feel American vaccination effort instance easy see someone partisan bias beyond reasonable point. want give credit Biden, also recognize Trump put position could did. want give credit Trump setting Biden position, gotta recognize great things Biden opportunity. can't ignore one love other, either say contributed little it.

I think lot like moon landing. presidential effort, American effort transcended presidential administrations. I'm happy see comments like even very, partisan site. example much United States accomplish recognize achieve common ground, absolutely beautiful see. posted bunch shit Orlando too.  Tbh like idea boomers getting holidays way vs everyone slamming popular destinations once.  Dude weed lmao!! Poo!! Rofl!!!  Nice idea government effectively solve problem morally offensive many Americans, raises many awkward questions problems could solve chose to. desperately trying convince enough Americans take vaccine problem get solved, avoid awkward questions, everything remain is. would rather die allow government billionaire corporations force get vaccine. I’m even anti-vaxxer won’t getting vaccine purely bullshit like this. 25% population want vaccine...do really think states capable putting much work? try, competing things going always possible way forced like transit. I'd like see businesses mandated pay home-working employees ""office fee"" addition pay. 

I'm get screwed next gig work-from-home since wife already works home, space equipment apartment. I'm going rent office space (or something) pay myself, electricity etc. 

I like we've learned many things remotely seems like every time things change, employee ends giving another inch. doesnt take much variant ""magically appear"" (the word looking evolution, happens around us every day). viruses immunity vaccine become prevalant better dont - simple survival fittest. may true variants immune vaccine build immunity time society top vaccinations. Rage you’re kinda missing point whatever. don’t really care people think either, lady. Same. fucking hate mid-manager hate gets thrown around here. 

Do people understand little time give shit sitting? 

Is work done? Great! not, going chatting whether person remote, don’t fret! April 3 weeks away, almost certainly doses hand. swim across Detroit river buy fake ID ;) Nobody need convince one way other. mind made up, that’s that. said, really research vaccine able come quickly. understand reservation, I’m scientist. do, however, trust unified professionals advise something don’t know about. 

There ongoing clinical trials show us well vaccine did. want one people doesn’t get vaccine, doesn’t contribute way community, potentially deal chronic complications disease? give answer! Someone actual points good argument make internet equivalent saying ""well ugly win"" ahahaha context using term *discrimination*, means unjust treatment. Whether treatment unjust somewhat eye beholder. changes time. long ago American society courts see unjust prohibit people sex marrying. 

There's universal, accepted set kind characteristic biases unjust. Front line healthcare worker restricting anyone otherwise won’t anyone even mean? Public policy shouldn’t based science? Maybe, definitely would opposed stimulus packages Agreed, getting resistant.

Agreed. think funny people reddit loathe even admit that, usually. think guy good even average admit something done right regard. Again, really true. excellent data vastly reduced transmission. asymptomatically infected, can't carry virus. even get remotely frustrated people still taking intelligent precautions. woods yet... especially 80% us fortunate get vaccine yet. lady talking probably unvaccinated acted best interest... know vaccinated anti-masker. vast majority people wearing masks vaccinated good around them. judging wearing mask way perceive judging wearing one. news outlets 'america vaccinated 1% population today' articles ready ctrl-c+ctrl-v post next week think wont give grandma covid vaccine mistaken.

We know vaccine doesn’t prevent transmission. come contact corona still chance getting spreading weather I’m vaccinated not. 

I think vulnerable populations get 100%. vaccine designed reduce symptoms. vaccinated still chance getting virus. even reduced chance, exact chance vaccinated not. know America's response pandemic terrible, way many Europeans seemed relish much suffering last year really got me. little reported side effects

I still expecting we'll cross 80% Americans 65 receiving one dose end month. states still largely focused group, reach 80% we'd need around 10,000,000 first doses. think very, achievable, think reaching number lot cement precipitous drop we're seeing hospitalizations deaths.

Yes, I’m doctor lol Yes many lawyers taking cases pro bono now, anyone situation, check local lawyers office East Jerusalem annexed Israel proper, East Jerusalem residents (theoretically) eligible Israeli citizenship. situation West Bank entirely different. can’t homogenized “vaccinating Palestinians.” Yup, also Redditors really bad assessing future implications action

Imagine new terrible STD mutation results result ""summer love"" everyone keeps telling going happen year. hotel chains start asking either proof STD vaccine take degrading test site order prove it. Refuse extra $100 night deep cleaning fee would added stay.

This starts us dystopian path every megacorp whatever reason want demand access part private health information. work home gang clutching pearls horror thought spending couple months exposed 10 people indoors.

Meanwhile service industry thousands nasty bitches face since pandemic started, y'all still can't figure wear masks right, every week lose coworker 14 days cover get better. Sometimes us. We've lost family, we've seen older coworkers quit facing public every day scary. 

You guys totally right worried return work majority vaccine deployment, get wrong. read fucking room, complaint makes look like paid attention cared essential service workers risked lives many times even died keep fed, comfortable, entertained throughout this. normalized get vaccine? it’s 95% effective really shouldn’t bother someone get all, masking distancing vaccination pretty much covid proof. everyone get vax smells like bullshit work preschool without date shots, including flu vaccine. 60. remember people leg braces polio. also remember going grandmother visit friend her’s lived street confined iron lung. 

I young didn’t sense scared. think realized dodge crippling deadly bullet born age vaccines. Yeah, like businesses decide wanna let people based vaccination status. discrimination people refused service choose ignorant fools Thank you! actually ethical? Americans read 1984: Reuters poll Getting pregnant can’t take care kid also stupid choice. Thank ❤️ I've told dad he's WAY likely die blood clotting issue covid vaccine. Shut bigot, grateful opportunity sacrifice entire life protect boomers would let die street alternative paying bit taxes 3rd house know long term effects decision lol crazy, haven’t stopped working going store whole thing. traveled across America, gas station, rest stops haven’t gotten sniffles once.

Great! Let's determine public health policy tell would inclined get vaccine know average vaccine takes way longer develop. 

I'd hope would see reason witnessing tremendous loss life last year. work, might inclined get vaccine employer mandates it, whole point thread. Yeah. best friends wife telling ""Harvard"" educated doctor researching vaccine concerns. made sure times aware friend Harvard educated. good test taker maybe money/connections means anything. knows wanted doctor. Got straight pre meds. also knows got virus destoryed inner right ear Sept 2019. would say things like, think deaths overblown. blew eventually selfish self centered c u next Tuesday. getting vaccine entire family. seems often take conspiracy side things, change tune rational side. like, stop asking others opinions. Ask me. trying pretend know everything. base knowledge fact. love science.

Oh also, hpv vaccine. Told prevents cancer kids get it. Nope. someone else medical field told exact shit decided it. administration tells people even fully vaccinated wear mask distance public, downplaying vaccines. Damn.....I taxes taken entire time. horribly dumb question, mean get bigger tax return? don’t disagree that. also shouldn’t saying statements made regarding herd immunity “big assumption” aren’t. 25 percent country vaccinated, plus data coming big countries, enough data? kind world live now? many batches made per week?

If one, millions doses per batch: surprising, vaccinated time.

If couple thousand, surprising indeed, although could people good spotting patterns there. argument falls apart

How exactly argument fall apart? links support I'm saying. future, maybe fucking read first. call stupid stop stupid. City stunned learn many kids bullied poor bad teeth parents can't afford dental care. agree principle know well ""enforcing mask usage"" gone much US population. agree. lot summer events cancelled due uncertainty, I'm expecting US cities essentially giant block party July 4th. literally never downplayed vaccines go guess. Psychooo Yep. still seen son, grandchild, maybe 3 times. told could go crowded restaraunts travel Florida weekend could come hold him, mask on. refuse, saying right go mega churches restaraunts Florida maskless. Fine, right protect child. fair, partly fault. lack quality control led initial dosage blunder. sense different manufacturers might right. Great rebuttal They're supposed part 1C I'm sure that's coming They'll replaced eventually pipe dream opening restaurant, would probably dream right now. fact whole industry could forcibly shuttered months, semi-shuttered year, little/nothing way rent relief mortgage relief loan relief, makes way riskier endeavor. Like knew restaurants could fail never considered pandemic happening... something people would factored risk analysis this. It’s working out! mean guy who's came less two months completely turned around fight pandemic vaccine distribution helpless putting us position return normalcy summer latest? talking president? guess mods deleted comment praising vaccine smh fuck sub r/wowthanksimcured You’re confusing everyone eligible everyone getting it. There’s way hit 75% mid-May. We’re 2 million doses day. Even go 3 million, it’d take close July 4 get herd immunity. That’s meant. Yeah.. ICU Deliriums absolutely crazy-pants. really weird combination of:

* Dreams exceedingly ""normal"" mundane (things like ""buying new car"".. weird woke dreams felt ""normal"" ""real"".. actually go back Emails txt-msgs,etc convince actually happen. 

* dreams nightmarishly bizarre (like Dr Strange surreal, people swords threatening kill me, witches demons etc) .. (to degree) could write fantasy/imagination. 

But insanely trippy like ""being trapped carnival mirrors"" way out. Also trippy really sense ""passing time"".. sort like ""there"" mans land. awareness outside world,. idea anyone else even existed (or whether anything try save not). 

And one day ""wake up"".. start fading back normal reality (as heavy-sedatives slowly wear off). Re-orienting ""normal reality"" bit like ""rebooting"".. watching various systems start come back online. really talk move 1st. could watch Nurses come go check fluids change bedpan ,etc. slowly could move arms legs. Start rasping 1 2 words etc. took couple days able sit bed normal conversations. 

But yeah. .the physical Rehab getting daily fitness groove home daily life big ""Win"". There's could (cutting Soda sweets hardcore changes really wanted get super-strict it). 

It's crazy sit back comprehend things I've survived past year so. I've tough times life (I'm 47yrs old now).. past year pretty much takes cake moment. neighbor nurse, refused get shot, caught COVID really bad, still talks shit big deal is. became patient hospital still learned nothing. possible medical professionals interested longitudinal studies experimental gene therapy available emergency use authorization opposed FDA approval necessarily protect getting passing first variant COVID-19, may reduce symptoms multiple later variations virus? Ticket prices might go somehow opened March Madness full capacity. again, happens south probably get record sales prices. tell boss unvaccinated WFH forever, even better, companies never reopen offices. months ago went primary doctor wore 2 masks. nurse said ""Ugh, breath like that?"". doctor nurses dealing directly patients wearing masks, none admin staff back paid co-pay got referral. bit shocking. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 46 year old business tanked spent last year home-schooling son....that would restrict travel ability provide work travel based. I'd support refused it, us even available yet.  cross bridge get there, best keep pushing educating many people possible get quickly possible new variant beats us punch. Meanwhile county stopped vaccinating new people due lack supply 😔 means recognize can’t convince bigots facts. don’t bother white supremacists, anti-vaxxers, flat earthers either unless respectful show openness facts No, I’m AZ vaccine trial. Got doses December. still go every often blood draws. Oh god, PLEASE, love everything, let go ""BUT SAID MASKS WORK ONCE"" argument? Science changes change it. beginning, know effectiveness masks disease stop mass hoarding they'd available healthcare. said science changed recommendations mean trust fucking CDC. everyone wants it, restrict choose to? They're batch. even problems appear different. Italy least reporting heart attack, others blood clots least related issues. Ah is, personal attacks bullshit argument falls apart. Glad got early.

[100 mil shots 100 days Dec 8 vaccinations eligibility, scroll Cool show bombings Africa south America south east Asia we've done last decade I’m saving answer family. Thus they're rolling vaccine first to: 

the elderly immunocompromised (Who likelyhood severity disease might die), 

people multiple comorbidities (Who scientific process identified likely die contracting)

and Healthcare workers (who sheer amount exposure much increased risk contracting dying it)

As demonstrated, people vaccinated, rest people likely get sick much less restricted do. still bit idiot refuse vaccine, one make you. agree you. I’m saying that’s response people worried... science going convince them, would “but I’m worried” conversation. try override irrational side brain afraid unknown. Hears thing. know covid is, around year. know risks worst case scenario catching covid. However, know worst case scenario getting vaccine. scientist taken anything biology related since 10th grade. necessarily trust saying harmless familiar enough science come conclusion own. 

I'd rather take risk something known rather something unknown. fully accept downside catching covid. 

However, vaccine need freely travel world, positive outweighs negative I'll take it. time not. Google enters chat... Honestly, too. think unmasked large crowd anxiety soars. Even going friend's house feels like big deal year going nowhere seeing one. I'm going ease back regular life slowly patient kind myself. also important remember fears unfounded. Coronavirus big deal hurt many, many, people. unreasonable say people serious mental scars coming pandemic. boomer parents same. skepticism dripping Facebook nuttery. sister (who works hospice care elderly) said she’s getting “fertility reasons”. they’re idiots. I'm reading cases folks accidentally injected empty syringe. Even ""concerning"" I've 0 side effects vaccine (though realize that's uncommon). reliable way validate I've developed antibodies? Would antibody test relevant apply naturally developed antibodies getting COVID? pandemic already over, according numbers.

Citation point, requiring everyone vaccinated virus &lt;1% fatality gratuitous, unnecessary, make sense.

Tell someone lost friend family member. Seriously. See happens.

The R0 COVID-19 high &lt;1% fatality rate translated half million deaths country. people took issue statement last night morons. He’s cautious along. never said celebrate. 

It’s conservatives trying find reason bash Biden. 99.7% survival rare WTF not? emergency government force leave home. pandemic concluded, might legal discussion, emergency powers broad. Based 1.1% total covid deaths age group, .3% total death rate together. equals .003 x .011 chance 100 (or .00033%) die covid, infected. - driving car dangerous numbers.

When young also almost died (I think was) small pox shot. Might polio. me, anti Vax causing autism anything like that, safe body. 

TL;DR think every human allowed decide want take shot. body choice. Especially prior proper FDA approval. personal reasons data I've analyzed I'm getting atleast proper approval - all.

Note: sure I'm getting voted someone explain what's wrong statistics. Sorry decision made im what's best survival, everyone. We're five years pandemic sign let-up.

Oh... wait. Nah man, make decisions based believe best health.

I traveled internationally year ago February like 10 US cases. wore mask plane self quarantined, bureaucrat told to.. I’m getting vaccine soon it’s available believe it’s right decision.

Remember Fauci telling us wear masks, wear cotton masks, wear two masks, wear one mask, two masks? kept moving goal posts necessary vaccinations?

Go outside look national infrastructure many politicians ignoring Covid guidelines. I’m letting people run shit make decisions bodily autonomy. Even still trouble vaccine distribution poorer areas getting level doses. ban travel unvaccinated banning travel poor people. rich gain another privilege. I'm pro-vaccine completely contrary ideals country founded on. want idiot, right one.

Not mention, vaccine cards they're handing would incredibly easy fake. way dude. roll eyes give silence response. Seems get message across pretty well. one person get actually offended try start argument. least 9m Pfizer vaccines used U.K. accounts U.K. imports EU. AZ vaccines used U.K. brewed U.K. already are. way, way harder find therapist 2019 city. Many ones open charge $300+ per hour. Thank you! already feel better people like 'chance' back data. mums doctor remember December mum told nurse trying talk getting vaccine saw something Facebook vaccines mess fertility. medical student mum knows telling mum trust vaccine. guess shows even educated people fall crazy conspiracy theories. High five, fellow bleeder everything power prolong pandemic

That's weird way frame Biden administration's massive efforts vaccine distribution. Yeah..

Which point wait least early summer longer subject availability subject individual choice.

Anything earlier causes anger. Also become standard businesses operate skeleton crew, taking day means either pushing work onto already overworked colleagues, coming back double workload.

That situation got union job. Also, use one 10 annual vacation days sick leave, tempting work cold could days go vacation family.

As said, it’s pretty fucked. six month mark isn’t formality. 

If simply given would approved 6 months, would approve now, knowing would increase vaccine uptake? monoclonal one? Thanks. least helped us options working jobs see exactly little valued employers. better know. someone spent last year tiny apartment myself, looking forward first Monday back office. finally use dinner table eat again, rather it’s current use home office. expert? Know lot vaccines? already downvoted lol. people value security liberty know always turns out, I’m sure evolved well beyond mistakes every civilization known man.... self righteous hubris worries most. asked source, provide please. 

Also, you’re ignoring fact independent strains seem hitting general mutations. 

Lastly, increases ACE2 receptivity doesn’t mean it’s escape variant. article mentioned shows isn’t many options left virus evade antibodies still remain infectious. Unless show 200x infectious mutation also escape variant, it’s fear mongering something worry you’re vaccinated. Thank I'm sure responses taking account people like mom CAN'T get vaccinated. severe allergies unless know EXACTLY questionable ingredients (things like ethanol sucrose) made can't risk it. mom develop proper immune defenses illnesses whether gets vaccine illness itself.
I agree people choose get vaccinated restrictions - eg mask requirements work, negative test/quarantine travel - can't get punished. fence shouldn’t push hard right now. Best let people around vaccinated. sees directly talks tk get let know wasn’t big deal. (Peer pressure works) plenty time come around people willing. 

The issue push hard shut actively become it. tk get decide it’s safe. dealing parents in-laws. best best get vaccine time comes let know. worked sister-in-law it. saw sister get okay maybe it’s safe pre-registered. 

If fearful MRNA vaccine that’s using technique let know too. 

Just remember fence anti-vaccine person concerns help resolve concerns don’t push data overwhelm her. Let hear stories people trusts get it’s time. I’m done nonsense. Blocked. wait IRS guidance. millions like Yeah that's negligence threatening lives others tends go down. Hell yeah do!!!!!! countries really determined smear AZ vaccine. France back tracked , Germany backtracked. money Denmark backtracking well. think Kroger gave Covid shots nothing too. people willingly endangering others past 12 months?

Yes, 100%. essential worker stopped counting number people either following restrictions bragging following fact, healthy bodies 99% chance fighting virus.

That's fine dandy unless one 3+ million people u.s. fated do. High density country, poor economy, poorest nefarious investment terms Vaccines.

Yes can't celebrate holiest weekend, honestly see nothing celebrate.  God really sucks. really tragic somebody like could idea what's going home bunch wrong ideas US that's lot news comes online.

The unfortunate reality information age bad information much good information. experience education know check source reliable, believe anything. I've seen happen across political spectrum worst effects seem come anti-mask crowd right, literally feels like different reality point. quite year ago, March 21 2020, saw [this ""Final Warning"" posted r/Texas subreddit. (I started get active r/CoronavirusTX including live-blogging several Gov. Abbott's early press conferences, last April joined sub's ""mod squad"".)

If looked PSA over, perhaps Texas connections, give whirl. impressed me, also scared crap me, level detail, sourcing, balanced willingness acknowledge answers &amp; situation changing daily, sometimes hourly basis.

Today, March 12 2021, I'm traveling Galveston see family seen person since last June. fully vaxxed 2nd shot 2 weeks ago, everyone immediate family least one shot. 

We glad alive relatively unscathed. God good, also ""God helps helps themselves"". easy, staying F home much possible, masking up, distancing, dropping plans Thanksgiving, Christmas New Years favor video calls. easy, correct, I'm grateful paid off. completely counter American culture self determination. Maybe Target give us $5 gift cards Covid flu shots year. Dream big, people! Ive working ""office"" since last May people around infected everyweek....youll fine I’m sick people claiming vaccines rushed haven’t fully tested. said- probably closely watched thoroughly reviewed vaccines ever created. process faster one trying save money delaying stage, waiting create good marketing campaign, on.

The full monitoring period may elapsed yet- unlike drugs- weird long-term side effects interactions drugs- vaccine side effects manifest quickly.

Plus mRNA based vaccines actually incredibly simple design produce (now stability problems “solved”) risks actually low.  No. That’s stretch. Nobody wants that. Live let live. mean D-Dimer lab pretty easy blood test rule blood clots one frequently ordered. shit confirming (because things cause elevated levels, imaging required confirm), effectively rule possibility clots negative. long covid lab done recently rule blood clots. negative. There's loads information online even subs reddit doctors frequent. Though one would need symptomatic ordered ask HC provider need be, exist commonly ordered. move next phase vaccination March 22nd. essential workers eligible day. Maybe Gates worried bad batches vaccines producing blood clots risks thus resulting vaccine hesitancy. I'm hearing propaganda. vaccine protects fine SA variant, falling antivax nonsense. Europe want AZ vaccines much, bloody well give back us. Definitely. Thank you! EU fucked everything up. Thanks mrs Von der Leyen. Lockdown may june There’s going generation kids going year behind school. It’s going suck high school college age kids adapt effectively lost year. Even you’re learning (debatable) also missed year extracurriculars socialization. There’s lot non academic stuff can’t learn pickup virtually. Tempt good time. childish individualism needs stop. told something, therefore definitely won't! regularly scheduled checkups, long town care go. Redditors mostly kids people mid 20s, never forget Vaccines always work well immunocompromised people.

From reliable sources mods Vaccines may work well CD4 count low. CD4 count low, may help take strong antiretroviral medications receiving vaccines. I’m sure people saved plenty money food well. People like me, would constantly forget grab lunch fridge leaving work morning, I’d wind spending several dollars picking something restaurant lunch hour.

Don’t worry forgetting lunch work home.

Also, LPT: longer forget lunch morning, keep car key fridge it. Ahh, confused. Thought RPN.

I never went nursing school, first responder. RN's worked BSN. look dinosaurs Ark Encounter KY, strange things explains like old world is, Noah fit animals ark, We've known antivirals work give early disease progression roughly year now. Even Remdesevir, HCQ, Ivermectin actually something give on, roughly, day get infected. that's basically impossible. time symptoms show already late. wasn't, paid non-US companies created things. outrage machine must flow  practicing RN current NP student, you’re mostly correct. differences are:

PAs tend go right practice school, whereas NPs bedside experience RNs going back master’s.

NPs practice independently physicians states specialties.

PA school tends around 5 years, whereas NPs usually 4 year degree BSN/RN plus 2-3 years master’s.

Otherwise similar roles! got sit home SAFELY collect free money. bet order out, went shop non essential items bunch shit made essential employees work harder... take vaccine personal issues, demand people take even personal issues it? Amazing. Congress shall make law respecting establishment religion, prohibiting free exercise thereof; abridging freedom speech, press; RIGHT PEOPLE PEACEABLY ASSEMBLE, petition Government redress grievances.

Ally r/2020PoliceBrutality unclench wasn’t literal 🙄 Wait wtf credit score 22?? guess badly worded question. meant terms place residence. must within far hospital not. GOT VACCINE CALL TODAY!!! Get waiting lists, people. it’s pandemics end whimpers, headlines.

I might disagree this. think day airports stop requiring masks kind day people remember rest lives. investigated found nothing wrong. Let tell you, there’s nothing enjoyable gratifying seeing people haven’t seen since lost weight. 

Their reactions make every struggle get worth it. 2020 supposed summer me, lost 160 lbs Dec 2018 Feb 2020 freshly single. I’m gonna enjoy year later, even gain 20 back lol (some muscle) 

Happy you, really milk shit lol. It’s best feeling.   wedding May 29th I’m clinging hope least 50 people (guest list 149).
Our state still 10 person limit weddings... Even constant plunging cases deaths. 

I’m nervous statement Biden make governor even bother loosen bit, even things continue improve VA.

I one dumbest things ever read site great example problem small people trying foment tribalism. Please tell non fly state immune raging stupidity. soon take 30 seconds google find countless examples idiotic behavior especially local government level. lived bluest places conservative places unfortunately we're similar different comes questionable decisions local politicians. 

Also read article, headline BS. city vote end mask mandate, going expire anyways, extend it. vote 5-4 extend it, guy broke tie clear happy vote celebrate it. girl one several people spoke event. article bunch hicks burning masks right hoedown, agree outcome vote would hardly call example raging stupidity. actually fuck that. Comment aside, think first world second world? two different things really aren’t comparable. You’d surprised prevalent hard figure impacts. work Behavioral Health spend waaaaaay much time “ensuring health field” managing people refuse adopt evidence based ideas addiction mental illness. 

People “help” others, far often, “it worked person it’s go all” approach. Many many people work decreased productivity home. want return office quickly possible, also support keeping people home. need find way actually require productivity let folks go. people think hear ""nurse"" 4 year educated nurse.

Incorrect, become RN 2 year associates degree nursing. fact thought RN's educated ones bode well overall argument nursing education levels variants virus formed mutation among people vaccinated creating whole different strain virus could potentially dangerous deadly original. way stop virus mutating stopping spreading new hosts. effective way thru mass vaccination. 

Get vaccinated. yourself, country. Wow that’s neat! [Smh Perfect Peggy going ape takeout!

""SUCK COOK HOME STUPID BRAT!!!!"" ""IF DARE LEAVE HOUSE BRATTY KILLER!!!"" would also really like know answer question. sexually harassed one start football players high school told ignore take things seriously principal. graduated HS 2005. Care actually link evidence tells us testing left out?

Because reality vaccines undergone testing probably closely watched reviewed vaccines ever created. real difference duration unlike drugs- weird long term effects unexpected interactions- vaccine side effects manifest pretty rapidly. Nursing tough job true lot roles. training process oriented. 

Your company’s guy doesn’t need know microchips manufactured. Nurses don’t need know deep science behind vaccine. Yeah! Fuck ‘em! don’t wanna get sick! Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Please find Christ. Also go look VAERS ask people “there literally negative getting vaccine”. common sense. go put spy kid glasses crawl bunk bed watch show Factor time spent things like hair makeup, save hour day sitting PC pajamas. doesn’t even count commute.

Not mention money I’ve saved year buying makeup. gas. putting miles car. not?  Wish DOT would mandatory transportation workers well also protected. ten seconds educate yourself:

I'm educated definition pandemic. CDC continue classify COVID-19 outbreak pandemic. data provided continues show significant spread virus. great new infections, hospitalizations, deaths declining, community spread disease worldwide impact one can't reasonably claim pandemic rest comment, I'm hearing lot emotion little evidence rationality.

I provided plenty rationale. provided none. linked CDC classifies COVID-19 pandemic. argument non sequitur conclusion (the pandemic already over) logically follow facts presented (new cases declined). Lies make around world anyone stops truth. added small caveat make comment less bullshit others take fact. Europe, shit show there. Hopefully y’all spend less time shit talking America time fixing house. interested see willing percentage ends up. think it'll definitely go 70% we've got good chance passing 80%, think would little unrealistic think 90% Americans 65 want vaccine. 

Just cite figures, KFF polling 77% would take soon available. break ""no"" ""maybe"" aggregate level white Americans, ""Maybe"" 10% black Americans 14%. spot assessment least line polling. I'd expect low support, don’t want antivaxers hold us hostage decease change title democrats support restricting unvaccinated people Imagine letting government tell allowed hug vaccinated, someone else’s choice exist public without vaccinated near zero risk complaint take forever get point storytelling. gets tedious much meander way important conclusions pandemic. essentially ""whole issue"". Person A's parent still negligible chance death hospitalization vaccination, person probably lower chance transmitting it.

We'll soon able quantify risk, virtually chance gathering spaces US require proof vaccination. many Covid deaths fully vaccinated US next years? Enough justify setting expensive intrusive bureaucracy? fair, that's US done every minor threat recent decades. that’s place start! 

Sorry WFH situation. wife forced continue working office, couple weeks home wonderful. year that, I’m sure lot people find hard lose time commutes, useless chit chat, expensive lunches, etc. odds dying seriously injured car crash hell lot less 5% still wear seat belt. guess defensive driving enough shouldn’t bother huh?

I work ER never break...

 Enjoy filithy animals lol Jackass, huh... saying education among nurses varies greatly might contribute trend nurses outspoken anti-science voices? I’m saying nurses suck they’re undereducated, I’m saying better educated others. exactly shitting nurses? Seems like woke looking something upset today. 

It’s hypothesis based facts nursing education true easily confirmed google search. can’t say agree there’s direct correlation pandemic cuomo’s treatment women. true needs use clear words.

It’s mixed bag pretty everything world. 

I’ve never seen many people obsessed single president. It’s unhealthy. sides it. I'm guessing cause family members friends they'd lost corona virus. Almost everyone probably knows someone died it. believe totally normal human response. Abortions traumatic experiences around them. 

It little difficult existential sympathize potential mother impact child may physical mental health, equally important. 

There lot gray area circumstances surrounding abortion hard understand differing perspectives them, however, certainly scenarios abortion needed physiologically, psychologically, sociologically important remain option need them. goal mass vaccination defeat virus least minimize impact. Continue willfully ignorant though. Let’s see far takes you.  Masks part though. basically respiratory disease year, masks make huge difference population level. High vs. low mask compliance simply big factor regional success (e.g. US liberal cities vs. cities Scandinavia, mask use scarce late pandemic).

I think masks mandatory around certain patients, think ascribe success year quashing bugs masks. whatever like. I.

Basically he’s calling fugly gonna take years get data want dude. saying feasible aggressive pro-quarantine arguments. they're without jobs, law led people who've risked lives lose jobs. 

I thick grocery store workers throughout pandemic. got hazard pay, great, power them. not, join club. know exact delivery timelines 3, I'm sure timelines considered + plenty contingency case suppliers fail deliver like AZ EU.

I'm CERTAIN AZ vaccine used soon gets emergency approval. reason think otherwise others followed path. lol Dude I’ve lived people don’t wash hands shitting bc “aren’t bad wiping”. Fucking disgusting, wash hands using restroom apes got mine today! Quick smooth process. big donor season ticket deposits aren’t coming they’ll change tone. 

I give (ironically) 2-3 weeks available everyone issue  Thanks! American exceptionalism world attitude. Excellent 2022 able get vaccinated? second Herbert Hoover. Rightfully scary precedent. New medical device fully approved forced people. sound scary anyone fell way behind podcasts commute disappeared. started listening dishes I'm caught up. No. don’t want people die. We’ve list enough. suggestions wouldn’t followed anyway. Fda approval implied prerequisite this. Hmm, Yes, unconstitutional. favorite enough statistically significant Absofuckinglutely. I’m going enclosed space 8 hours day asshat could get sick. spend damn year inside (mostly) moot immediately one said Americans weren’t gullible morons. ""I'm 100% certain exact date use it... I'll give away"" = poor planning. Oh know reason can’t dedicate time day that? tending injure impair

Using definition, absolutely prejudicial. injured longer allowed patronize business.

2. leading premature judgment unwarranted opinion

Is premature judgment? Probably, least cases. business would ideally allow people infected Covid. exclude people vaccinated, still excluding people pose danger infected. reasonably considered premature judgment (without full consideration facts Covid tests, isolation, etc...) arrives conclusion based entirely vaccination status.

I’ll use definition.

It certainly preconceived notion, completely fails consider relevant factors, think could qualify based “reason actual experience.” could certainly qualify. still winter cold. like wearing mask outside wind face. gets warmer anyway... Mask mandates gone June. Well done, Robert Baratheon. I'm med school tbh I'm bit worried it'll permanent fixture hospitals.

On one hand, very, good preventing transmission disease. other, communication extremely important, facial cues connecting patient. tried interviewing Cuban immigrant appendicitis N95 on? think potential miscommunication impersonal nature masked interactions real downside. Also, devastating hospital infections come respiratory disease healthcare providers. fomites carrying things like c. diff., MRSA, etc...

I hope that, rather 100% masking, enforce staying home sick greater degree. hope mask around certain patients certain situations (just like we've always taken contact precautions patients certain infectious diseases). 🤣  mental illness debilitating, there’s people even giving chance

The point takes work first part getting work done admitting needs done. People like always come conversations acting like admitting there's problem problem help anyone. can't give chance heal without first admitting need ancestors gotten too. better brains

At end day, human beings nothing brains brain chance repair heal like muscle. first step healing admitting need healing. really. assuming lot.

Like condition is, smoking. Massachusetts, smoker's actually count priority condition. honestly agree that, I'm going utilize it.

My volunteer work happens outside close contact people helpful getting people they're going car. anything big right risk low. point using leg up.

There's plenty seniors need vaccine still trouble getting it. I'm going jump line take one somebody's grandma. That's pathetic.  Honestly saw Americans—lots grass always greener folks knew variants aren’t scaring people enough. Try invoking children. fucking don’t. Well you’re butthurt smug law would give grocery store workers extra pay didn’t get pay. 

So yeah, you’re that.  fucking selfish. leery vaccine rushed market conspiracy. also yet FDA approved dangerous walking 20 feet street walk past someone maskless. Still FDA approved. Ok wait that. US already pace 1M day took office, setup ramp without intervention. He'd literally sabotage vaccination roll miss goal.

Biden well streamline logistics ramp manufacturing possible late stage, goal joke. Morally I'm everyone getting vaccinated even work forces I'll absolutely still wear mask outside cold. love additional warmth. Come Spring however, different story. That’s topic another day. People shouldn’t restricted kinds things I’m saying. Fuck that. year we've careful able protect vaccine. Whatever remaining risk low enough impact society. Nobody believes thing stop believing irrefutable evidence. could convinced otherwise first place. 35 million people fully vaccinated. They’re FDA approved normal sense process. emergency use they’re approved causing lot skepticism justified wariness. That's really I'm saying. I'm saying America acts unheard of, 1.6 billion people east Asia it. clearly isn’t true. It’s based political party controls area. took lot effort making post. Thank you, well written! like always donate money funds help support front line workers. ""sponsor"" grocery worker pay $5 hour, 40 hours week. right thing seeing passionate it. understand would fine carrot stick approach too. Anything makes folks safe. get daily vaccination numbers? CDC website use delayed week March 9 2020, sold house one side city moved 30 minutes save hour daily commute.

I've spent less quarter working days since office.

&amp;#x200B;

On bright side, new neighbors nice I'm near lake! knew risks themselves, doubt attendees took precautions after. 

Fwiw protests last year. I’d go protest, isolate 10 days, stock food/groceries, repeat. didn’t actually catch gf time brought home work (restaurant industry workers got fucked across board)  Well done. Making good progress. Bet hit 3m tomorrow.

Let’s work making sure hit atleast 4m day end March. Time get mass vaccination sites northern football stadiums open soon!  last decade, feel govnt companies best interest heart? course not. said, interest rush vaccine market fingers crossed? betcha! It’s EU, it’s Denmark Florida 2nd oldest population, yet 27th deaths, much laxer standards. 

Masks like TSA. I'm sure something, ain't safety measure people make be. It’s extremely doubtful everyone actually able get appointment end may. Even could still take month fully immunized. People IUDs get knocked time... (it’s common move place they’re effective idea) 

You’re likely get blood clot IUD, though, still extremely unlikely.   could mistaken, perused Pfizer contract day, think specified delivery specific US government warehouses. Assuming AZ contract similar, even AZ withdrew application without penalty... AZ doses already sold delivered. think take back. Ugh, hate wearing masks airport. normal times work United Club pretty regularly wearing mask hours end without chance break I'm working computer super annoying.

.....and also like seeing people skirting rules. feel like find center makes angry stressed. already know many people idiots, want know exactly are. percentage population can't get vaccinated medical reasons. speak herd immunity, them, people get vaccinated choose to.

This case every vaccine getting vaccinated medically able important herd. also currently includes anyone 18 vaccine deemed safe well. People wised truth we're never going allowed return normal force it.. police stops way party

See here’s first issue: cops shouldn’t stopping without cause. assume opposed school districts requiring kids standard set vaccines allowed school? According source? hospital! Jesus, chance get 80$ vaccine didn’t get it, give right receive thousands dollars medical treatment! Yeah, I'm probably going ease masks 2 weeks second shot, I'm bus subway train plane, yeah might put mask on. Sardined tight closed space randos, colds Covid there. Congrats, Michigan! April 5th far away! I'm hoping Texas opens eligibility sometime April well! Also location. wants live industrial park? every office beautiful skyscraper city. Lots dud locations. Also lots code things conversions understand decision. I'm elgible trying get appointment two weeks. I'm checking minimum 2 times hour appointments often every 10-15 minutes. absolutely nothing available county, walgreens location area offers it. 

So, clearly there's still massive shortage going on. mention every hotline area broken line. goes straight busy close. connects says closed. absolutely embarassing rollout happening. honestly dont understand point is. let ask again:  
What part current gun laws comply 2nd amendment supposed read? able slap cheeseburger obese persons hand? Obesity, heart disease, kills millions also preventable. ban fat? Still don’t think forced. could make argument lot things. Yes, nursing isn’t even science-heavy degree regardless. take watered versions science courses. there’s lot nursing theory curriculum.  Certain countries restrict travel without certain vaccinations already, don’t they?   Jeez national average low. 67% still seems shockingly low working old people known high risk. surprised. friend mine works nursing home told half staff refused vaccine although thankfully pretty much elderly residents took vaccine. it’s new sudden. People don’t get skeptical email reasonable they? number anti-science, anti-rational thinking people commenting post truly depressing. Hopefully it’s short lived feel back normal soon. Congrats. boss, slacking meeting deadlines means capacity loaded work assume support abolishing minimum wage say teachers gotten vaccine. I'm proud vaccine rollout all. Putting bunch teachers ahead elderly people underlying conditions wrong. Teachers students distance learning. vaccinate kids putting back school adds unnecessary variables done largely economy amd nothing else regardless governor says printed calendar everything 2 weeks second shot: haircut, picking groceries myself, etc. strange, hopeful. mean, drive work everyday fully aware could die car accident. go runs everyday fully aware could get run killed distracted driver. risk management... like lot Americans I'm huge politicians dictating cannot do. way could take it?

That we're going leave individuals health draw line especially items involving negligence currently codified law? Carol Stream school district IL sent notice 120 teachers received vaccine called sick fevers...

I’m going wait see side effects one bit longer Yes is. vaccines “rushed” vaccine. process done faster, bureaucracy. science.

Stop pushing invalid opinions. plausible argument start reopen infection rate starts grow, return current state limiting in-person interactions. agree with. requires opening, results opening largely unknowable - maybe we've reached ""back-to-normal"" herd immunity threshold, maybe not. 

This fair. main thing disagree idea return normal first reassess. Given R0 numbers seen, know virus hard contain. think makes sense limit activity unvaccinated avoid reversal downward trends.

An employer school mandate force anyone get vaccinated provide reasonable alternatives in-person work unvaccinated. require people wish participate in-person activities first vaccinated condition participation group action protect individual safety almost always terrible idea.

When say individual safety mean person's individual safety opposed general safety population. I'm getting safety people risk cannot avoid contact others. real. “Trust this” kind goofy way finish statement trusting random internet knowledge. Regardless law is, people right body autonomy.

Rights come government.

Rights protected government.

I trying justify position whether every law United States just.

&amp;#x200B;

(ps. sorry delayed reply, reddit timed reason. tried continue conversation via dm chance issue related thread) It’s bought supplies, don’t expect exports till Q3. view rights supernatural possessions like soul violated, see think that.

But view either lack rights rights - there's sense talking lack rights ""violated rights.""

All rights result positive action affirmation rights. Anything else lack rights. 


The pleasant circumstance alone deserted island mean property rights, example. bit dumb since there’s vaccine kids. mean travel children? agree fortunately getting covid vaccine extremely safe procedure makes coworkers safer. Apparently “not much education physicians get” = hard science education whatsoever. Like damn, study ass years then? Didn’t know could walk hospital scientific literacy nurse!  we’re still requiring masking even mass vaccination 

What. Was. The. Whole. Point. Of. This? Psst: productivity plummets outside office miss boundary work leisure. Personally can’t wait Fight least work-from-home days minimum. it’s worth got absolutely leveled second shot. wouldn’t want force someone go otherwise healthy risk. Better under-promise over-deliver over-promise under-deliver.  vaccines proven eliminate transmission vaccinated people? vaccine help prevent major health issues vaccinated. 1% mortality rate higher bitten almost lethally poisonous animal North America. among dangerous things ever happen life.

If 30M Americans bitten black widow spiders year, would consider unworthy action?  let private businesses freely decide let people based they’re covid vaccinated. still encourages people get vaccine without authoritarianism give show you’ve vaccinated? sort mark that’s easily recognizable constantly show papers everywhere go? Seems like it’d pita hope need Boosters keep supply chains distrobution/injection sites up. It'll lot smoother becomes periodical thing.  Going men's bathroom sporting event/concert bar, I'm always disgusted witness less half guys wash hands urinating.

I cruise before. hand washing stations everywhere especially go eat. kind wish something like implemented everywhere. Like go doctor's appoint enter office sinks outside wash hands. Yet recently couple days ago still mulling another lockdown. Why? also live oregon understand concern saying teachers aren’t offered vaccine? That’s true. K-12 teachers phase 2A. teacher got vaccine early February. Ive actually really proud oregon’s vaccine rollout, county live in? wear mask work makes job difficult cus ppl can’t understand me. hope I’m fully vaccinated joe let ditch mask bad managers. Remote work major recruiting benefit going forward. Smaller companies able poach talent. Disagree. they’ve series good news articles last month, also plenty typical trash tier clickbaity journalism headlines. last weeks:

“The Pandemic’s Future Hangs Suspense” (how doomsday-esque?)

“The Differences Vaccines Matter” (imo don’t) 

“The Brazil Variant Exposing World’s Vulnerability” (it’s not) 

“What Never Reach Herd Immunity?” (We will) work basically required us show proof vaccination get forsee point telling people can't work get one. I'm sure legality (this TX). shocked learned yesterday. it'll issue Weak dumb People looooove feel kind superiority complex, first mask it’s vaccine feel like ""back normal"" concept East Coast thing tbh. Masks going permanent fixture West Coast culture on. It’s going fully approved next month two that’s moot. thing close 50% percentage getting shot. restricting unvaccinated. would know actually looked polling data. come Russian case numbers high given using vaccine long even exporting it?

In words, vaccine works what's rollout? could self centered narsasits.  dumb question, injected nothing would mean even experience sore arm? imagine would feel literally nothing afterwards Even history mind, reasonably wonder mRNA vaccines previously approved use people. here, too, confident know:

Although COVID-19 mRNA vaccines new, type vaccine studied people before. mRNA vaccines HIV, rabies, Zika flu tested phase 1 phase 2 trials people. technology also used clinical trials way treat cancers. Even though products licensed use people, efforts provided important information mRNA technology safety.

mRNA made used protein production cells bodies. such, cells mechanisms place ensure protein made quantities greater needed. One way happens mRNA “poly(A) tail.” cytoplasm, tail ensures mRNA decay. mRNA used make proteins cell, length poly(A) tail decreases, short mRNA continue used protein blueprint. happens, mRNA breaks removed cellular debris. process limits long mRNA remains cytoplasm — and, therefore, much protein produced.

As such, poly(A) tails ensure cell breaks vaccine mRNA timely manner. Likewise, understanding allows scientists design vaccine-delivered mRNA way ensures stay cell longer needed generate immunity.

Because knowledge gained vaccines, Food Drug Administration (FDA) required companies making COVID-19 vaccines follow trial participants minimum eight weeks could submit data approval. Likewise, participants mRNA vaccine trials continue followed even though vaccines approved use.



Same source nursing home work higher average vaccination rate among staff, 67% vaccinated. national average 40% range. opinion, think they’ve done fine job this. People like blame presidents hate literally anything though (see: every time gas prices go up). eh employee gives option, everybody want work home. work. dirty outcasts get work home. approved vaccine, enough vaccine available yet, it’s easy sit armchair like “I ain’t takin’ dat derr vaxeen, itsh soshalust con-speeeracee ...” people “i’ve got mine.” soon personally inconvenienced, they’ll fold like paper airplanes. Soon be, take almost free vaccine like millions others work/travel freely, pay 110 dollars doctor’s visit 89 test itself, every time somebody wants produce negative test within last days whatever reason. Ha, if. Welcome health care system voted for.


It’s like 737 Max. They’re like “i ain’t flyin dat derr airplayne, it’s death trap” that’s aren’t flying now, don’t need walk talk. They’ll buy MAX ticket soon saves twenty dollars. Turning office buildings apartments meet residential codes prohibitively expensive. They’d high end lofts maybe city needs dozens buildings 20 floors those. Wow

You asking lot simple comment.

Was supposed point reinforcing popular opinion wait full availability eligibility.

Did want add anything? Whatever want buddy, tell me. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Oh boo hoo, wear piece cloth face outside protect others! horrible! Awww, thank you. Right now, strange state feeling comforting also strange. I'm sick bullshit hedging ""maybes""

That's MRNA vaccines mass produced right even though they've never mass produced 2020. literally whole point OWS UK's investments building factories UK. don’t think I’ve tell HR lived before. needed address mail stuff to. work comments.

I saw they're even talking Lollapalooza Taste Chicago get possible event plans works good news.

America Europe would fucked too, many obese people wouldn’t survive multiple rounds covid would work I've already filed taxes 2020?

And Novavax kind like Moderna another pharma chain seem pretty good terms with. well good fam!

maybe bit empathy people cannot get appointment. think situation every person every city, know tell you.

the fact single person vulnerable among us still struggling get vaccinated utter failure. quit apologizing. bad. better. gotten without Pfizer's distribution, Pfizer group spends money hand you. executive order served purpose, prevent doses exported initial ordered doses US needed them. 

Notice addressed main example UK fact also export ban. think US invested money country planet factories US export countries? think every single pharma company completely shocked December executive order signed, needed completely rethink global supply chain? Find one article company realising need relocate global supply chain US export ban caught surprise. 

Everyone knew moment US spent $11 billion would prioritised companies inside US. ...huh? Read again. third major revision Inslee's reopening plan. None plans lasted 2-4 weeks scrapped entirely manually forced reopenings. high confidence plan last much longer previous ones. 56% good news. 100% obviously good news. 

We want stop spread, get next immune escape mutation negates vaccines entirely, people get vaccinated forced sick. real question, trial tried answer, much vaccines reduce reproductive rates. 

What good news B.1.351 antibodies seem work well strains. booster shot that, unless there's another immune escape mutation, could actual really good news. results back interim analysis released January provide window challenges presented variants — also underscore largely robust protection offered vaccination. new findings also add nuance initial analysis Novavax data suggested people prior infections might protected future illness, preliminary concerning signal. following study participants longer, scientists found prior infection may offer “late protective effect” reinfection, company news release stated. dominant strain UK one wasn’t even original Wuhan strain. variant G significantly transmissible original. ton articles it.

Like they're saying *now*, yes, cases going June July 80% adult population vaccinated? wish data vitro studies like one mentioned Pfizer did, could compare results actual clinical trial efficacies maybe find reliable enough link two, extrapolate real world efficacy would given variant respectable degree confidence. Maybe JnJ Novavax vitro studies SA variant, could find connection. 

I think still naive confident ability guess efficacy Pfizer's vaccine SA variant. 2 vaccines around 60% efficacy one much lower. make one norm one outlier, opinion. 

Having said that, Pfizer really shown perform well (understatement) across different metrics, would surprised failed joing 2 efficacy SA variant. still, voicing kind certainty think scientist myself

Much easier protect prevent vaccines try produce antibodies treat. summer I'd ask what's missing, since lot normal summer stuff outdoors. I'd ask myself, tired even lost much? lucky work, I'm around high risk people, etc. lot knowing whatever want even desire it. really go concerts nightclubs nice knowing that's thing that's normal okay. miss big festivals, races, sports games.

That's hit really hard summer last year. I'd always look forward going event, convention, big movie theater, trip somewhere everything cancelled last year.

I recently went small horror fan-convention (everyone wearing masks socially distancing I'm fully vaccinated), felt great finally sense normalcy again! can't wait see Black Widow theaters May get delayed again. It’s alarmist sounds. know we’re going free covid entirely. also know worldwide vaccinations take year two fully roll out. effective treatment help bridge gap. far know, experts expect mild waves line seasonal patterns. Assuming choose get vaccine live somewhere widespread access vaccines, individual risk low, still expect wave globally. Yay!! Let’s go keep going! reports I've seen say vaccinated gonna get 2 weeks final shot. idiot voted soon. cares seeing name print. proud Attorney General who’s indicted felon. I've known people different experiences, common factor people sore arm first dose. sister basically nothing second dose. Mom felt fatigued (still able work fine) morning mid-afternoon after. Sister's boyfriend rough time sleeping night back normal got good rest next night.

For everyone know, side effects day next day second dose

For me, got second dose noon nothing yet. sore arm first, maybe bit tiredness/chills well could reasons Got mine Monday feeling pretty tired today well, sore arm went away though. announcing return office workers August September, depending city. keep employee mask requirements ""for foreseeable future.""

I'm telling guys, optimistic full return normalcy. Businesses going continue masking requirements even governments drop them. Wow, seriously going become talking point vaccines? Jfc. Ok, feel bad seeking avoid one shot. Thanks! Yeah people use type sentence time refer factual, current information. example one might say:

“Right, USA cases country, take precautions” something like that. they’re referring now. “Has had”. talking boss today. benefits WFH don’t want discount them, agreed times wish could person solving problems knock someone’s cube. What's happening Governor Newsom looking recall huge chunk population got rather disaffected French Laundry scandal.

As 37yr old vaccine ""line jumper"" myself, fully support sentiment got done healthcare workers 65+ crowd, open REGISTRATION everyone. schedule appointments based priority group supply vs current eligibility alone. someone 55 gets appointment sooner (I got mine next day without much effort), someone young healthy gets date maybe three weeks away. every mass vax site needs stand line shots left shows. guy whose last comment “i still wonder would happen functional adult(s) would done, instead leaving states..”

Learn formulate coherent sentence m8. decisions affect others yes. think better start forcing people things okay unfortunate may affect better making decision basically take away people's right body? noble protective, ushering power government, case noticed actually care us. Looks like we’re seeing cases begin plateau lot states. real question hospitalizations continue dip result vaccines, they’ll level too. find next week two. always argued open Easter/let mask mandates expire end Biden’s 100 day challenge. Southern states jumping gun weeks may cause swell cases (or maybe not?), I’m predicting catastrophe. A. Probably way less “vaccine microchips” group
B. choice
C. opinion recent data shown cross neutralization antibodies generated South African isolate DG614/wild-type

But that's precisely potential issue raise important. least worth thinking about. precisely they're cross-reactive new variants able activate B cells origin believe you’re referring sometimes called”original antigenic sin”

O G name freaking amazinggggg it’s notable strains influenza significantly different observed coronavirus

Exactlyy. That's find much relevant here. deck stacked booster shot, seeing existing antibodies initial dose(s) able bind B cell receptors extremely hard booster shot differentiate B cells way would want to.

Original antigenic sin 😍😍😍  it’s worth, wording also confused little lol thought Georgia reason little confirmed cases Ah nevermind then, thanks info Agreed. plan announce Memorial Day weekend grand reopening, getting many people vaccines possible.  disappointing sure especially rest country going down. seem making good progress vaccines, everyone know 50+ seemed get appointments without ton hassle lowered age least hopefully getting vulnerable protected even numbers trending up. rich like politicians, life already normal.

So you’re expecting point no-one argue one way other, keep waiting.

A better thing estimate, it’s “filmable” event you’ll know sure exactly occurs, CDC say safe lift restrictions, including mask mandates. guess happen following true:

Oh wait... that's decision make. Whether think know what's best people, individual's decision. us stay home. Frontline workers, including many underlying conditions, able get vaccines many states May. It’s fair us throw everything open toss masks many us could still get sick die. aren’t correct. already said vaccinated people don’t need mask social distance around Oh wow lol, realized responded twice different comments. 

For games even less capacity people. Season ticket holders get priority tickets there's even smaller amount go around. Honestly though, I'm thinking we'd quite close 100% capacity time all-star break comes around Amazon offered help employees get vaccinated. norm now. relay concerns almost every epidemiologist agrees get voted lol Someone else could’ve used It’s 66% effective 30 days, it’s 90% effective 56 It’s one greatest accomplishments human history, par moon landing, it’s overlooked poorly handled everything else pandemic. Nah, I'm sorry sub supports ""gaming system"" much. say ""keep refreshing appointments"" insinuates appointments still limited literally taking away someone risk. matter arms vaccines go in. realistic chance wait extra week could matter life death prioritized people. Going ahead life unvaccinated opened get much ethical.

We vaccinating way many people virus harm. late I'm trying guilt trip anything least encourage this. Hope so! Anybody access English translation article? Well don’t see much concern right now. Reason recent data shown cross neutralization antibodies generated South African isolate DG614/wild-type. Meaning infection B.135 seems confer immunity variants coronavirus well 

I believe you’re referring sometimes called”original antigenic sin” far Im aware phenomena observed mainly influenza vaccinations. it’s notable strains influenza significantly different observed coronavirus, vaccinate influenza extremely frequency owing much faster baseline mutation rates. Take together mutations referred “extensive” uhm...certain media outlets they’re actually relatively minor. It’s simply location spike they’re relatively extensive *region* makes noteworthy. foreseeable future think you’re concern bit lower priority list That’s good news calling people take vaccine! I've said every comment saying that's wanted said. saying need keep entitled nose people's choice choose to. phrase 'muh rights' shows little respect fought died hand freedom choose silver platter, can't stand seeing people kick graves understand dangerous authoritarianism is.

Yes, people can't take vaccine. Okay, get it. know makes think okay tell people can't. happy throw basis society drain equity? get it. Silencing dissent discriminating people share views make society better place. drains life, diversity ideas keep we'll get nowhere civilization. K, well, suspect received inaccurate information. here! Good luck. Also find username hilarious. know, right? That's thing political posts: political.

This one different non-political posts motivated science facts, politics agendas. Random stanford professors pushing lie-based agendas year now, pisses off. can't apply science rationality instead profit politics?

The particular lie lockdowns mistake. not. way states could prevented millions Americans dying. entire hospital system weeks collapse workable solutions. test nursing home workers every week. test everyone symptoms tell isolate. even tell someone symptoms flu COVID. treatments, IFR well 1% even working hospitals. political statement, though politics got us there. facts situation March 2020.  Yes, ***WHEN*** Georgia (or wherever) two months (or whatever, days) low numbers, time people start figure they're really going go up, people vaccinated.

The past tense kinda important there, people time looking back previous months. Scarves exist they’re low enough temperature yes 16 months initially experts said expect last 18 months. We're pretty good guess.... crazy vaccines predicted take *at least* year, 1.5 years April/May 2020 ready US 10% vaccinated *12 months* *first shutdowns*? literally piece cloth face, stupidest little inconvenience complain someone wear real PPE entire work shifts started zero sympathy. get become symbol 'tyrannical oppression' totally sympathetic economic impacts restaurant closures etc, really asking much everybody wear mask *after* local infection rates actually drop significantly, regardless personal vaccination status. effective possibly even legal way police received vaccine day day public spaces, given compliance mask mandates far real obvious significant number mask/no vax folks given leeway. Don’t know, that’s asked someone MD name. that’s friend PA told me. remember reading look it. arabs getting vaccinated? maybe bit empathy people cannot get appointment. think situation every person every city, know tell you.

That was, quite literally, opposite point, hence ""aren't personal anecdotes fun?"". know experiences universal, neither yours.

 course empathy can't find appointments, I'm looking data trying come logical explanation California's vaccination numbers going despite stockpile going # vaccine sites increasing. lever two positions, one definite downside measured deaths, numbers backing up. Simple decision IMO

You need evidence base decision STOP on. Without evidence keep giving people vaccine. 🌎🧑🏼‍🚀🔫👨🏻‍🚀 Send unused shots countries happily take them. Germany problem. correct, least regards public interactions private interactions people unvaccinated person participants households. smart err side caution 70% distribution achieved area. new. still think doomsayers less annoying people trying dunk them.

This recollection. reading daily since Dec 19’. Honestly, think we’ll fine long keep vaccinating people vulnerable end vaccinated. evidence work 3 months? know actual case numbers are, that's asked source, misunderstood saying, something sounded it.

The ""two months"" figure people getting hung on, tense used. know! I'm seeing much this. I'm curious means Canada. faster push needle less hurts. Slowing liquid helps it’s really viscous. barely felt mine lasted less second. Getting 1st shot tomorrow...never excited stabbed life! Sure? What’s Moderna like comparison? Pull method effective birth control.  OH. Oklahoma resident.  confirm, tribes (at least larger ones) allotments. addition state got. super easy get vaccinated state right long willing drive half hour so.

The Cherokee nation also offering vaccines non-Native American people live household Cherokee citizen. requirement 18+. vaccine guaranteed work three months. Okay highlighting important bit. ""20 cases day two months"" **mean** anything. mean ""*for*"" two months? least almost relationships even stronger going it! largest recipients ""Foreign Aid"" portion bill were:

The Global Fund Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis Malaria, dealing COVID-19 directly support programs normally run mitigate impact COVID programs.

The Center Disease Control Prevention (CDC) help combat COVID domestically abroad. 

The United Nations COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan.

The COVID-19 Global Vaccines Access (COVAX) program, effort get vaccines 92 low middle income countries; new commitment Trump refused join COVAX due association World Health Organization (which US process withdrawing time). think workers ordered come back. think work home, least heavily flexible work schedules combo office wfh stay. wtf problem? people struggling find appointments. goal?? insufferable. Nah, get shot. Vaccine immunity stronger convalescent immunity. Okay still struggling? Food services big part number. Everyone works restaurant get vaccine now, that's lot people CA Well, assumed people posting would know...

That two months kinda important. week enough people realize low rates going up. boyfriend celebrated first anniversary. We've seen person twice time. got second shot yesterday. I'm excited go suck fucking dick He's hedging South Africa (probably) Brazil variants. 

True mass vaccination definitely USA strategy suppress original strain B-117 (UK) mutant. JNJ coming online achievable. interesting see efficacy comes out. first moderna vax today barely felt needle prick. Reading sub spring/summer last year like watching car accident unfold. stop coming reading everything, probably assisted mental health decline loss weight. stopped checking daily much better place mentally. place terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like changed quite bit now, checking first time since last summer. Yes exactly that. lasted minute two. strange. worth noting AZ company agree produce vaccines UK.

Yeah, made part negotiations. SARS 1 much longer we've known entire pandemic. RemindMe! 2 months 20 days no, let's pretend sort predetermined success. 

It was. investment MRNA vaccines made years U.S. got incredibly lucky. 

No, *invested* science &amp; R&amp;D technology *years* - got lucky worked out. not, we'd still developed one vaccine approved initial timeline, would looking natural herd immunity,

Or expedited trials. lot better “open Easter.” yearlong lockdown I'll ordering tub pasty white skin *that* many options, pick one! real right now? Holy shit Europeans whiny. benefit 10x relationship us you, wild enough say makes US look bad? Arround yes, vaccinated people still minority. stock market bubble reaches stratosphere lmao told great. Love it. Good stuff needs done.

But play devils advocate, I'll share seeing.

I staffing recruiting living U.S high dollar positions white collar workers completely fine...

Machine shops manufacturing plants need help signs everywhere can't get people work there.

The reality is, people working jobs got let got whatever making almost much money sitting home unemployment would went back job right waiting them.

I blame them. throw away job I'd way rather collect unemployment go back work.

There another problem addressed here. Wages need go up, can't keep people unemplyment forever, shit getting hand. great looks like we'll plenty vaccinations give, need make sure enough people willing get them.

I'd encourage anyone fence check [vaccinations vs. cases super encouraging see red lines going green lines going up! promised domestic uk production

It's worth noting AZ company agree produce vaccines UK.

Valneva, Novavax CureVac will also producing vaccines UK

BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline wanted supply UK solely overseas.

The reason UK keen domestic production partly EU27 countries blocked exports PPE UK ordered NHS paid last year - leading people dying get sun never set British variant? fine. evolving situation. plan represents best gauged trajectory time. vaccine rollouts reducing cases better expected, perfectly acceptable change plan. Yeah wish he’d stop that. disaster AZ EU. Brilliant! Maybe hyperbolic discussing highly contentious &amp; deadly illness isn’t best thing fat ass slam dunked chair Cheesecake Factory second maximum immunity kicks received first/second Moderna vaccine:

Were instructed avoid ""cold fluids"" 24-48 hours vax administered?   Yep. I’m keeping mine. genuinely hope becomes normal wear one cold whatever. Seems courteous it’s nice get multiple colds winter.  Nope. Cities run area see fit. State governments well defined list things responsible for; like federal government. Anything outside falls cities; likewise things handle rest citizens. happened 2k ?  should’ve separated science people pr people, past year pretty shit messaging. it’s general public follow scientific method. outside thats chilled anyway \*context

How place? I'll need source. 16-18 age group actually last group vaccinated Israel. 20s age group last.

After opening vaccinations 35+ age group, vaccinations later opened high school kids 16-18 order able get back school prepare finals. Two weeks later vaccinations opened every adult citizen 16 up, officially 20s age group could finally vaccinated. Though people vaccinated leftovers. I’m saying think everything else automatically assume anyone knows they’re talking days

Deal, I'm going assume talking arse clearly are. Oh okay. Thanks confused that. disagree last thing want federal government moving screw things anymore. may ok handling large population centers. rural America nitch case touch touch policies make things 10 times worse. hospitalizations get lower 29k, we’ll lowest point since pandemic started. healthcare system total collapse. 

Per capita total, matter. keeps up, deaths going skyrocket. telling US test positivity 1, less 4k new cases per day hardly deaths, still stay home? eligible based 2020, file 2021 get full credit owe back.

Except none Trump said going happen actually happened. Remember “it’s cases coming China, it’ll soon disappear” “it Easter” “20M vaccines New Year”. make meaningful predictions actually came true? main cause concern may resistant vaccines prone reinfect, similarly B.1.351 (South African variant). bet you’re states telling cities run things good riddance shit sound really scared ;-) age makes sense. There’s two problems happening tier system. Either vaccine site strict documentation qualification tier slows administering shots (or people confused get proof don’t bother registering) it’s super lax people skip line. 

Lots people point checking qualify condition gets tier, vaccine site even bothering verify. simple ID birthdate tier makes much sense people know it’s turn, it’s impossible skip line. That's said prepayment 2021 taxes. means getting prior 2021. like last 2 stimulus checks prepayment 2020 taxes. also change fact reason delay filing 2020 taxes child tax credit. Nothing tax form going change. IRS creating portal update family situation (like baby) opt monthly payments. going determine eligibility based either 2019 2020 taxes, whichever current. giving vaccines back? **NO.** worst case continued community transmission leads mutation current vaccines cannot protect against.

If mutates something current vaccines protect against, put us back square one. mutates something even deadly equally transmissible, doomed.

What suggesting dangerously irresponsible. virus care ""muh freedoms."" People need continue wearing masks distancing vast majority population vaccinate vaccinate. Small gatherings? Oh come on, least try ultra-conservative. I’d surprised mid-sized city PA doesn’t fireworks display year normally attracts thousands people. sounds like least exciting thing look forward to.. work?

Maine’s current plan, wouldn’t able get July. Nah definitely one times. states can’t fast enough federal government needs take mass sites send pharmacies. local hospital system Maryland atrocious Remember said 100m 100 days we're probably least 200m Lel whole ""let's allow states figure trust properly"" thing

Ok needs end. objectively false.

States infrastructure, makes sense manage this. given vaccines told 'good luck'. present written plan approval feds addressing dozens (hundreds) specific points. Then, CDC published tons resources website states, providers, etc. vaccine shipped.

This failure effort. large, healthcare professionals vaccinated other, took holidays (and weekends.) took weeks understand slow moving, governors begin threaten hospitals. Then, things started ramping up. ways? He’s probably working administration bit well. assistance states private industry. shall see happens. Detroit. We've vaccinating grocery store frontline workers since late January. Like slightly metallic? that's mean yes. pretty tired mild headache first dose Moderna last week COVID know of. Wondering second shot go! Fauci said high CT’s causes false positives interviews December. saying fauci wrong that? ""Absence Proof Proof Absence"" ;) Yes, exactly page. Forgot visa situation that's alien investor/H1B.

For example, wife American visa US (also applies 180ish days til breach taxes would apply). yes investor visa tourist visa would still need provide proof residency get it,right? mean I'm boat citizen living abroad wifey able get cause status.  counting reaction EU politicians. never happens. completely spineless point Europe basically colony. whatever US tells to. kept hearing 4 years Trump absolutely nothing Trump able swallow. Including vaccine export ban. long... HR send Post Office Box. Im sure guess exactly kind efficacy would see booster shot inclination significant. 

I agree raise worth considering don’t think it’s problem immediate future. Like said implications comes influenza vaccinations aren’t huge. Also keep mind Moderna currently testing 3 different approaches booster shot; simply third shot current vaccine, combination current vaccine B.135 specific addition, B.135 specific vaccine. think overly concerned wouldn’t testing third dose existing vaccine, seems imply belief variant specificity isn’t end game case, it’s reestablishment previous neutralizing titers believe clinically significant 

Also wanted point I’m *pretty* sure certain childhood vaccinations follow administering modified booster shot (dont quote I’m sure) immunity still remains strong (in terms never reaction sore arm) second Pfizer dose absolutely laid *out* three days. peaked 102.4 fever, chills, headaches, extreme fatigue, works. set (about 12 hours second dose) get bed except water/restroom. Worth it, though. reason context 99% new scientific data coming vaccines coming Pfizer Israel? hardly see anything Moderna sub turned Fauci pretty quickly past couple weeks. hasn’t gotten everything right entire government bungled January-April 2020, guys far dependable fuck Trump rolled podium. Imagine different things would start Yes one reasons need hold back filing. CTC based 2020 info, depending income, may beneficial tax preparer wait file. Back production numbers still pretty low. 

The govt brokered several major deals vaccines since then, pushed deadlines vaccines couple times.

There’s denying new administration done everything possible get vaccines arms ASAP. 

I extremely thankful it. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Same. Got Pfizer Monday back hurts like hell today spent shit posting bed. fine Tuesday Wednesday except arm. Ten years now, Brazil's complete failure contain pandemic studied across world ""what do"" case study normal: cuddlefest. Yeah hoarding vaccinations blocking exports. Congratulations becoming arrogant country world, proud murica Let biden AG sue Paxton  Note: ""eligible"" take necessarily thing ""able"" take it. 

There plenty people eligible take right still able get it. 

I hope Biden clear people think broke promise can't get May 1. Could happen supply + administration rates continue rise 2020: ""No gatherings"" small gatherings

2021: ""Small gatherings"" large gatherings Italy manufacturing vaccine deprive Russian people vaccines. It’s gonna Drew Carey show intro across America soon !Remindme June 1st Looking forward vaced one mask soon 🤞 Why? smart that.

Compare last guy. Exact opposite way worse Dude. don’t even know respond. What, supposed lie say deaths door? would that? fear mongering blatant lie...they weren't. personal experience one knew young got got sick.

You clearly different experience since get sick....but understand age getting sick outlier result right? Like experience have.

I mean mitigation (masks/distancing/closures) hospitals get overrun. Since simple fact people get sick, people complying worried much themselves, think hard get compliance year? look facebook twitter health department comments. People going reach fever pitch clamoring get vaccine eligibility rolls almost everyone.

A lot people basically wanting comment ""[state] completely dropping ball! Lower eligibility 36-year-old gas station attendants zip code now!"" order doses, get ""delayed"".

Meanwhile America implements policies vaccine exports reduced.

TLDR: Promise delivery delivery, even paid.

Things finally starting ramp week though. realistically, somebody office, desk significant distance away others, accomplish anything making wear masks.

If blanket mandate even people office need wear them. unnecessary many cases.  Fauci said doesn’t negate said. one interprets late PCR results MATTER. argument. much aware late Cts mean less RNA (and extrapolation based history experience, less virus) typically present. 
How relate ""false positives"" &amp; PCR cycle numbers? false-positive PCR result typically means PCR positive virus ever present. 
This different infected person's sample *infectious* virus, yet still returning PCR-positive ""dead virus""/RNA fragments shed. latter false positive. true positive, indicating person infected time infectious. may Death count trailing indicator. Case count per 100k better indicator. Take precautions yes. you’re vaccinated case counts super low get Yeah getting vaccinated least many people confuse ""at least"" ""up to."" They're different meanings people seem understand. it’s mostly people fully vaccinated. Otherwise it’s probably sign going squeeze one surge vaccines get us herd immunity. know people probably tired seeing questions like but. wife gets second Moderna dose tomorrow afternoon. I've heard 12 hrs injection, start feel pretty rough. expect besides typical arm soreness. Chills, fever, body aches I'm assuming? Nausea, etc? indeed. live? office became eligible week everyone wants one getting one week fairly easily. got mine day eligible Yeah might able travel then. Probably highly vaccinated countries guess I’ve heard people say India pretty much herd immunity. case Brazil pass India terms cases? Even though Brazil testing slower rate India. cannon fodder, called heros. disgusting. Roaring ‘20’s, come! hate throwing parties, throwing rager get damn vaccine. Well post escalated quickly word kids? 7 5 year old I'm waiting get whole family done one go. fair fair. Might 16 soonish they’re trials non adults think 16 18, depend vaccine. Pfizer’s vaccine authorized ages 16 up. Moderna Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccines currently authorized ages 18 up.

They currently clinical trials vaccination kids. expected available late 2021. Literally Russian wants get vaccinated go get vaccinated. choosing so. basic training walked long hallway people shot god knows us air gun things didn’t needles. 

Send America basic. Hair cuts optional. Ya good thing, shows things getting better faster anticipated. Hope best prepare worst. biden going aim states open vaccines population May 1st (sounds fair), also say meet vaccine goals small gatherings July 4th? guess wait see small defined as, anyone else disappointed messaging? small gatherings last July 4th. Give People Choice: rural village Switzerland, half year ago, hosted wedding 200-250 guests. Along ceremony, turned 6 guests currently spreading virus everyone decided keep quiet ""nothing bad happen, it?"". they'd probably cancel Oktoberfest preparing weeks.

Come Oktoberfest two weeks later, dawned wedding guests maybe smart move attend wedding Oktoberfest week later everyone agreed keep quiet ""the economy"".

Turnout? people started hitting local hospital, case-count village 1,200 inhabitants increased 0 200 within week. 24 treated hospital, two died.

nope, trust people make smart choice...

Source: Canada may ramping up, US, rate much faster Canada. can’t compare. US response coronavirus one worst, worst it’s vaccination response best. 

Canada didn’t plan poor vaccination rate Dec-March. That’s Trudeau selling propaganda. I’m anti-Trudeau least it’s fact. completely messed order going CanSino instead US everything got delayed. Delays = deaths. 

The US going open everyone May people already vaccinated then. Canada won’t reach stage September unless US starts donating vaccines Canada suspect happen May. Canada able catch up, definitely government. completely bungled vaccine response. basically never ending waves. swear want lockdown till die happens, still need take caution. death count moment still high. Thanks didn’t know today able make appt weeks out, eligible. called friends would eligible too. big reason party. crazy me. became eligible Monday got Tuesday. took finesse calling around, means impossible. 55% state eligible right now. Holy shit light end tunnel getting brighter brighter every day now...and it’s *not* oncoming train (glares Olsterholm). 2021.

No, Christmas. Remember? nothing become it. I'm fully vaccinated I'm mask free I'm working. know upload stuff phone. assure though, he's good boy. need export licence send doses Australia. nothing preventing AZ sending doses EU Australia time contract signed, months months afterwards January EU suddenly decided introduce new rules (which probably illegal international law) allowing block exports steal vaccines countries. Around 50 million doses whole EU.

The hyper-hyper worst case scenario AZ Janssen deliver zero doses would set back campaign around month half. Obviously realistic scenario. Fierce competition! I’m sure situation Florida. Qualification based age, health status, small handful occupations (education, law enforcement, medical).

I’ve talked friends rural counties got “extras” pharmacies easily, doubt that’s case live. population Tampa Bay 3.1 million. 

Biden announced adults eligible May 1st, think true hunt begin—imagine many millions scramble! Maybe really enough shots infrastructure every adult wants one. We’ll see. gonna jaaaiiil breeeaaaak ... deployed USS Theodore Roosevelt. remember feeling powerless protect family back states. afraid someone loved would get sick gone. felt guilty safe ship middle ocean family risk back states. days later learned ship middle ocean definitely safe thought lol speaking atlanta, remember watch party olympic marathon trials got interrupted think US's first covid death brushed :( Joe state governments: Hurry fuck up! think too, wish 16, though.

Just appreciating author's use 8 different synonyms giving. feel like must spent Aka every high schooler's college admission essay remember months ago people screaming ""there's never vaccine developed five years!"" Etc. Well, even one year later almost dozen. Amazing. Wow would amazing. Good hear. I've drinking, like, 1.5 gallons ice-cold water per day last week, I'm craving HARD. know don't, subject discussion. wait boosters variants? 18 lol vaccine alcohol Biden’s remarks come United States administered record number vaccines weekend. Centers Disease Control Prevention administered 2.9 million vaccines Saturday, record, 2.4 million Sunday, according agency’s latest tally.

It's great see US setting new records vaccines given new records infections deaths. seems Russia cares exporting vaccine anywhere giving people Ya, apparently doubling number direct fed super sites opening dentists, optometrists, paramedics, etc. downplayed saying one know got worse flu. 

We Healthcare System doesn’t collapse? I’m sure wtf even means. 

And no, nowhere say getting 40 death sentence. You’re pulling ass. 

Quit marginalizing. There’s far many dead, age groups. see EU's beef ... whether used able make it. thats coach told me. youre running 400m see finish line stop running, take breather, chill baby Vaccines widely distributed. promise deliver. That’s fair it’s totally personal decision. I’m trying deride choice overly critical. think tracking local cases makes sense; I’ve same. I’m fully vaccinated numbers locally pretty good. Governor also taken seriously beginning (although messed plenty things anyway). 

I suppose, ultimately, would encourage begin open steady return normalcy. spent many months pure fear, it’s relief able let go feel safe again. Imagine we’d right mRNA vaccines hadn’t worked out. It’s brand new type vaccine knew easily could useless. true? doubt it, though data hand. Right. going cautious thing states go beyond. Kinda like states give rights can't go federal government. Federal gov provide baseline. That's husband says! hope right 🤞

Thank congrats upcoming wedding!!  agree, starting see messaging shift. imagine saying, even two weeks ago, could even small gathering 4th July? Lol comment removed using word neurosis? be, California moving onto anyone high risk 18-64 next week example Things get better better everyday! Sending good vibes way! everyone needs lockdown mode. interact children unvaccinated people (e.g. parents child) need careful. 

I believe Fauci said vaccines children 12 years coming soon. Sometime fall. interact children &lt; 12 years (and unvaccinated people) need lockdown mode.

Of course, variants ruin everything another story. plenty supply start vaccinate adults. Sooner likely ok 17 yr olders? i'm turning 18 march want enjoy stuff w friends :(

is ""adult"" 18+ 21+ 16+? biden type grandpa tells didnt get anything special shows brand new car hard lots people try push goalposts still! feel Dang, student (if student) probably nervous hell gave way low. long got guess. Lol see that. Jesus Christ Amazon Utilities, student loan debt, car payments, health insurance plus actual care needed, insurance, pet care, retirement home buying plain rainy day fund savings.

Folks don’t live rent food lol. Mine June 4th. I'm still sweating fucking bullets.  Well, apparently Biden gonna expand optometrists tonight. HEREWEGO! Nope  Based friends vaccine admin world worry. enough people actually administer vaccines.  Bitch ass virus cock blocked not... anything. going enough vaccine that... nothing, result would same... use magic powers say today... Ty Ty Ty Ty That's I'm calling political. I'm calling political choice ""Good News"" imposing restrictions force government, consider opposite necessity much good news.

He's relaying information going enough vaccine added nonsense he's going something. anything, thing would happen. Eligible May 1st. Thanks! UK government stepped make licensed model? hoarding bunch doses EU

No 12th grader online grad. fucking sucked.  1,799,999 doses Biden drops ball plan! /s sucks, CA open Monday. that's true stupid policy, doubt. would imagine everything shiny new ballpark due debut last season never did.

It host playoffs WS though. matter shake out, effective vaccines covid result US close relationship large corporations.

By invented countries. Sure bud. Yeah, bit floored read reasons like this. can't completly cut certain chains.. I’ve watching sub departure science statistics kind jarring. We’re probably year universal vaccination. I’m saying can’t expand list activities full blown COVID mania going kill people. people never like give credit people disagree with, don’t realize much weaker makes legitimate arguments them. lmao legit made laugh first US “real world” study. clinical trial live SC. amount people know completely taking vaccine staggering (but surprising). shake head spout nonsensical conspiracy unsubstantiated claims. would normally set straight get like obvious listen word I, anyone else except echo chambers, say.

Its sad America come to. US isn’t getting vaccines production facility.

This Biontech (not Pfizer) facility solely paid German EU tax payer money, it’s stupid export vast majority doses facility. I'm sure case, fairly certain started set supply lines soon promising candidate found, possibly even then. Yep Pfizer best Moderna atm. I’ve read recommended drink alcohol covid articles I’ve read mention quantities. I’m young healthy college student next symptoms, ok drink bottle beer every day? Great, give rest vaccines us Canadians please 😭 Didn’t manage catch full speech POTUS, say whether Americans would elegible May 1st, whether Americans would able get then? Ayoooo  Nah, everyone seems ""fuck kids"" train. guess since get seriously sick die waiting vaccines that's a-ok long means adults litty titty unmasked summer. EU fucking mess right B117 surges. hopefully turn around early summer. hopefully cheers bud light couple months now! here’s better days! Wow, thread state lifting restrictions there's immediate freakout sub tonight? 

Either kids asleep tonight trolls seeing writing wall, too. Can't keep locked masked forever, especially seeing vaccines major impact right less less reason continue hold restrictions. good news sign things rapidly improving everyone seeing happen. know psychological, that's feeling ever since snow big February storm melted. Pfizer Moderna nearly identical.  stress.  congrats Told you.. California last state drop mandates well, simultaneously botching vaccine rollout. 

The next weeks tell. even single vaccine invented America? AZ invented Oxford UK, BioNTech Germany, Sputnik Russia, Johnson Johnson Belgium...what exactly bragging here? Unexpectedly teared comment - simple another example happiness someone lost past year.

Japan magical, fervently wish make soon :) that's case... maybe say July 4th normal? like oh BBQ close family. guys would made vaccines earlier knew worked tho. say that, get downvoted salty europeans Hang canada. next someone birthday first week May best birthday present could ever ask for. ready get vaccine.

“Expanding Operation Warp Speed’s diverse portfolio adding vaccine Pfizer BioNTech increases odds safe, effective vaccine soon end year,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Depending success clinical trials, today’s agreement enable delivery approximately 100 million doses vaccine American people.” Um, “hoarding” vaccines mean buying need vaccinate citizens. guess hoarding food starving Somalians last time went grocery shopping bought food need?

I wish he'd fucking go say, ""Everyone go get shot May 100% back normal summer."" agree. People losing perspective rush vaccinate. Getting killed vaccine seriously bad look, especially places already vax hesitant (like US). safe effective alternatives AZ like Pfizer, Moderna, JJ, probably others don’t know much yet.

As result, got every shot available ‘70s ‘80s. available, I’d’ve more. 

But me? don’t know anyone terrible disability due things vaccinate against. morons look fact say “why vaccinate nobody gets anymore?” without making quantum leap logic reason nobody gets anymore almost everyone vaccinated. 

My kids vaccinated. teenager got HPV shots last year. get fucking vaccinated goddamn cancer now, reason, morons look bad thing.  everyone getting vaccine may doubt takes September Huh? talking restrictions lasting July. mean announcement every adult May get Sometimes don’t know even day 365 question is, media ever held accountable it? happy hear this. got phone friend learned close friend lost twin sister Covid. three conditions contributed significantly heartbreaking hear. know scene Matrix Reloaded remains humanity giant orgasmic rave Zion?

We’ve earned it. weather shit week. work place customers wait outside 5-10 minutes, amount adults full blown hissy fits every day shocking. think telling people ""Ok socialize, outside, masks, 6 feet apart"" would've gone heads, people would like ""we hang house, fine. raining, supposed do??"" mean. None vaccine approved 16 yet. 

It's much harder perform clinical trials children, since cannot consent. variants become dominant strain, even everyone vaccinated still take **some** precautions slow spread. Give vaccine producers opportunity make booster. 

I view vaccine immediate light switch normal. need ease stop variant break erasing year's work. think large corporations decide based CDC guidelines, probably everyone fair chance get vaccine. surprising majority public forgoes mask wearing well though I'm sure rounded up. probably (almost certainly?) going use AZ doses

I understand (the US) currently using them, I'm convinced going to.

AstraZeneca plans file Emergency Use Authorization [""within I'm reading [this correctly, estimated ""primary completion date"" Phase 3 (last phase) trial March 16, 2021, less week now. 3 vaccines, things moved rapidly phase 3 trial.

President Biden announced tonight May 1st expect open vaccination adults (not seniors, high risk, etc.). seems possible AstraZeneca vaccine could available date. Even not, still take time lot vaccine supply vaccinate millions people. assume part that. Pandemic baby boom... Time invest diapers! Literally crying right now... makes happy. COMPETENT LEADERSHIP. get amen?! honestly idea what’s going on. feels like they’ve first phase whole time made zero progress. weeks, example, county health department received zero doses administer. I’m Philadelphia suburb. grandma smokes like chimney. told cigarettes kill vaccine can. got first shot Monday! 🥳 ...Epidemiology? Air embolisms come! living abroad little year half Covid hit, haven’t seen friends two half years now.

I’ve lost 110lbs time. I’m unbelievably excited summer.  able 50 guests July. Get uninvited/now invited list ready.

Also maybe leave condoms bathroom closest dance floor. came ID, insurance card, proof employment didn’t ask it. confirmed name birthdate appointment system stabbed me. think Biden trying cautious. Maybe trying prevent people planning massive gatherings? think see larger gatherings July still don’t think need thousands people shoulder shoulder watching fireworks. Pretty sure 50% qualify today alone... Seems like everyone's got sort health issue. Good science? He’s pretty good regards COVID, whole family voted pretty sure June deadline way early, moved up, we’re way confident Post pandemic, sex good sex. stutter. scumbag die saying ignore science indicates order avoid scaring people? I've eligible whole time. finally scheduled get first round tomorrow. work, unfortunately death rates higher buy self-asserted cheap statements guarantees certain downfall. 

Of course AZ safe, otherwise would never approved vaccination. numbers approx 30 blodcloths total 5 mill vaccinated higher would see normal population. carte blanche go ahead, use logic present, ignoring reports deaths severe complications. 

When turn get shot, pleased know show healthy condition, also expect afterwards, accepting well known minor complications fever etc.

No health authorities claimed concluded deaths linked vaccine, merely precautional pausing give time review data. Nothing extraordinary taking note reported complications take actions gain knowledge. point 8 - 10 % vaccination programme, deathrate Denmark relatively low, 2 - 3 per Day, makes sense exclude doubts going full power, vaccine producers reach full capacity. Sup. It’s still ableism lol. okay it’s people disagree with? story going enough places administer, lack-of-supply.

There's quite bit already, there's stark difference states terms numbers vaccinated even though supply given based population. many cases state county politicians seem hiding behind ""supply issues"" mask logistical failures. (citation needed)

Bad undermines confidence/ discouraged people low risk category wanting bother vaccine.  places do. we're vaccine limited. NYC huge 24 hour site Javits Center They're getting India they're getting Gavi receives India. bilateral agreement place - simply AZ facilities India already.

# Responding question weekly news briefing Islamabad afternoon (Thursday), said Pakistan entered bilateral procurement agreement COVID-19 vaccine India. said international vaccine alliance - Gavi offered provide vaccine dozes several countries, including Pakistan COVAX Facility. said procurement supply mechanism vaccine dozes undertaken Gavi recipient countries. - today. Nice try though. would see entire report buy this. possible disciplined enough take mini-aspirin per day also disciplined habits avoid covid-19 (mask wearing, limiting unnecessary travel, avoiding large crowds, etc) ITT people understand science works accusing Fauci ""flip-flopping"". 530k deaths US (pop 330m), 1 5 = .2.

 .2/(530k/330m)= 125

The sphere average persons “someone close” US thus implied 125 people. Make 4 SAME! honestly worried maybe month ago I’m finally starting relax it’s going actually happen time haha Vaccine production Mexico seems likely given US-Mexico trade. ¿Por qué los dos? Yes.  pneumonia time life honestly say care lived died. 2021 still dealing crap. mean, even that. voted Biden. They're dumb, braindead Covid denying family. yeah Covid denying family, might something it. Hopefully Canada receive surplus vaccines + production vaccines US done CDC going say okay vaccinated engage activities cases low yet, know vaccine studies 95% effectiveness result vaccine due social distancing masks? I'll still inside 60 fps.  vaccinating million people day Biden even took office. 

The vaccine success US 100% Trump  varies based state. Florida getting lot “vaccine tourists” earlier on, started requiring proof residency. don’t know others. Absolutely brother. Looking forward better times. Wish could give vaccines friends :[ friend Canada really want see border remains closed. Kind hoping opens September vaccinations countries ramp up. wedding family day, going huge, amazing celebration. Mexico Canada getting every surplus dose they’re situated Hopefully Canada Mexico. ""I get whole ""you people"" mentality.""

Cool. care. True, future people live. Without sickness course. Well, ""65% 65+"" rings much better speech ""62.4% 65+"", close enough. official CDC figure rounding like that, fly, Biden? There's plenty worse things that.  That's husband says!

Hol up. Getting killed vaccine seriously bad look

Please careful writing. 

There evidence anybody ""killed by"" *any* covid vaccine date.

 hundred million doses covid vaccine administered across world. relatively small amount adverse events, serious adverse events deaths reported *connection* major approved candidates, (in norway, denmark, finland twenty deaths first several weeks vaccinating pfizer example)

It's standard procedure pause investigate. bears repeating date one single study conclusively linked deaths *any* vaccine holds true here. hope america foolish enough dump vaccine supply

There large phase 3 trial underway AZ US, FDA review rigor reviewed vaccines. date trial running major adverse effects reported amongst participants. 

US might need vaccines given portfolio secured, tens millions AZ vaccine ""dumped"" eloquently put administered people thus far across world. 1 billion produced given out. large chunks world using AZ vaccines, vaccine gone safety Immunogencity testing stringent approval processes candidates.
 
to suggest countries foolish ""dumped"" vaccines, insinuate using dangerous products based preliminary, small sample size news reports is, respectfully, really reasonable take, reactionary/emotional perpuates anti-vax sentiment. 

Just repeat article specifically states: link established vaccine subsequent “serious adverse events”. It’s coming soon, don’t worry. Eligible mean available. Cautiously optimistic May 18 birthday! truly best gift. CDC Fauci believe it? That's get. Telling vaccinated people travel make sense think people can't spread. He’s partly blame moving target announcements. First time heard mention anything mental health... don’t give damn. de facto main public health messenger leader US. that’s role stepped to, better account entirety public health repercussions pandemic, least refer someone speak areas less expertise in. he’s making far-reaching, unprecedented recommendations interventions, fucking better account side effects interventions.

Completely ignoring issue mental health problems, pretty large issue now, acceptable, I’m shocked people seem understand acceptable.

This far little, far late Nobody stopping small gathering. small gathering last year July 4th fairly strict state. course Biden CDC gonna recommend precautions law policy stopping basically anyone small medium gathering July 4th year. Well mean know anyone AIDS, that's died it...so can't bad, right? Thats people sound me. fear argument getting vaccine generally boils to.

If reframe refusal fear is, might get vaccine prove they're wimpy babies. could always get Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, ""newness"" mRNA vaccine giving pause. literally said base age; say take account health issues? See, already changing opinion. didn’t age; unfair inequitable. It’s Trump vaccine readily available. Especially compared *a lot* countries. sure point you’re trying make Murica’s always gonna #1 foreigners really bizarre. mom's doctor randomly called one day asked wanted it, got first dose next day. dad different provider said would contact us hang tight, announced first doses anymore. point I'm checking CVS Walgreens website daily hoping something opens up. many times going post this? made difference. would enough matter President. lot states? Maybe handful states (5-6) looking map right now. 7 day average overall -12.4% would call experiencing plateau means. think were, remember mom (a former army doctor) telling problems medically, well often broke down. numbers hyperbolic point obtuse, regardless forget important factor:

A large percentage refuse vaccinated overlaps taken little precaution thus immune following previous infection, symptomatic otherwise. 

The product relatively low lethality rate extremely effective vaccination truly carefree summer. We’re feet, yards, finish line.

Information spread contrary hardly better fear mongering w/o citation. Saving comment later.... type shit undermines public confidence y'all realize third population refused mask mask properly third pretended getting together Easter April 4th right?

there final mini surge, watch, yes country stupid Us’s system proving incredibly effective lol. somebody writes doomsayer tearjerker article doesn’t make so. ❤️  mean ends may 1st? far know correct. Trump's credit, administration great job Warp Speed securing us tons vaccine supply. countries planet significantly worse job struggling hard result. 

However, covers supply. Apparently Trump administration essentially plan distribution (other vague ""military help lol"" got tossed around) current administration came fixed heavily. would've enormous problem, deserve lot credit part. Lol sounds silly went first festival ever 2019, awesome time, plans go one last year. Obviously happen, year I'm making goal dance bunch strangers concert!! don’t wait forgot tell you. started early. state point. 

Then following science? point May 1st people already taken care of, available everyone Nope. think absolutely needed last summer. It’s bigger news people didn’t buy bullshit variants media outlets pushing. be.

Let's say 15 million produced far + 10 million India. Leaves 75 million 37 weeks.

Although UK may finish vaccinations first jabs June second jabs August (just kids left). UK commited sending surplus vaccines poorer countries G7.

Basically UK offered help EU Ireland, EU said importing third country would illegal, Ireland said good (thinking vaccines would appear), UK promised majority spares poorer countries. I’m sure it’s Facebook. body denying mental health issues, deadly virus could killed millions without sort lock kind priority 🙄 Good them! one ever denied factor literally contagious virus job Director National Institute Allergy **Infectious Diseases**. I'm European too! massive political rally peak pandemic last year conservative. smart 🧐 promise vaccine available anyone demand May 1st.

He direct states open distribution vaccine adults May 1st. means every adult able ""get line"" then. Currently, even people priority groups eligible vaccine cannot get demand. sign appointment get waiting list. eligible group now, can't get line yet. mean mind called hot wheels I'm probably best person ask. Gonna good protests year. can’t wait dance again. clubs, dive bars, shitty venues, fuck yeah remember partner distant quiet week decided stay home (before official lockdown). asked ok responded needed talk something. explained pandemic would probably take 18 months. utter shock. wrapping head around himself. It’s horrible year I’m lucky able stick together. want semblance normal again. still prevents severe cases COVID death almost 100% contact though. going TON people places administering that’s case. never never be. probably shouldn’t talk scientific research process don’t know anything outside read Internet. 4th July? Memorial Day Weekend everyone going bat hell. appreciate people admit wrong rather pretending never happened.

Or worse, doubling down. remember first started, saw somebody cafeteria sneeze broadly air say ""coronavirus, bunch bullshit"". Everybody table laughed snot rained them.

And thought - ever okay sneeze air purpose? Add list people would like take travel vacation, without significant restrictions. Alternatively, help visualize vaccinations help. measured way approach but, election year. Trump said hoax, Democrats corrected public messaging it’s stuck way since. surprised people’s minds blown. 
I still remember watching CNN interview woman testing line hours back April teenage son. teenage son symptoms fear get tested. couldn’t help think didn’t covid sure now. 1/5th population getting 1st dose + people natural immunity haven’t got vaccination damn near half country now. US knocking vaccines park. Well mean he’s expert viruses pandemics, mental health. first primary issue curbing pandemic. coming end he’s bringing jet injectors widely used cross contaminate people long covid reported improvement vaccines- seem help even already it! Studies, course, ongoing, grain salt people collect enough data double check everything. mean anything international travel? I'm glad we're talking era past tense now. called spring break happening I’ve seen posts say they’ve gotten 3 times. I’ve seen posts says got later comments reveal never actually got test. Things like that. ""At time every adult eligible May launch, partners, new tools make easier find vaccine get shot, including new website help find place get vaccinated one nearest you,"" Biden said. **""No searching day night appointment loved ones.""**  fact sheet, White House also promised create 800 number would serve purpose without access Internet, deploy technology teams help support states' websites. Eligibility vs ability though. know lot folks might eligible can’t get appointments Narrator: *it wasn’t* Good. vaccine rollout Delaware fucking atrocious Lol true. first saving ton money. still spend like $50 week alcohol drink home. Yeah able help get 7 coworkers (who english isnt first language) vaccinated last couple days. wait, went ochsner website made day appointment China Russia already spent doses abroad.

USA start joining help nations.

They need enough doses everyone everyone want vacine. prob covid. Oxygen thief.  Entitlement greatest home grown crop. May 1st theoretical date, people able get concrete appointments? kidding. problem media based NY California. We've indoor dining since May promise packed. eat Logans Steakhouse 40 unmasked strangers prerogative. mom 65 got approved hers. *New?*

Ah well. finally started seeing psychiatrist, hopefully she'll able also refer good therapist. wanna get mine first! I’m going student loan levels debt alcohol spending alone. ""Direct"" lol Lol Makes sense. shut society keep hospitals overwhelmed. 65% elderly vaccinated, seriously reduces odds happening. It’s time. comes inevitable “Wait 2 weeks surge” 90 million americans received it. elderly point gotten it, either want physically can't make Ye did? It’s open everywhere 16 live We’ll see.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ok, well way explained adds up😂 I’ll agree you. honestly. thing want done government stuff go war China... know would shitty... think needs happen. I’ll join army go war them. hate China treats people.. takes advantage poor. way life worth living stay locked homes forever can’t live lives? Seriously fuck “experts” say stuff like this. discourage people getting vaccinated. would fuck up? Followed depressed 30s, war 40s.   I’m Illinois week got email 65+ county 44% vaccinated. Pissed many dragging feet preventing faster rollout area. appears shots available you’re eligible criteria say you’re clear ethically. Go it. people r/lockdownskeptic banned automatically? We’ll find significant group people 3 months.  smart like Cuomo killed bunch vulnerable population right bat. Everyone going nuts year - June party going orgefest! first pandemic hit America hard century

I get sentiment HIV/AIDS continues brutal. guarantee virus would still virused lol looking forward since I’m moving state known beaches tourists lol  can’t believe believe propaganda Meh, really dangerous practice, worst ""code"" create virus kill someone. there's far effective ways harm people already, really effectively used good. Like 97%. way past doses vulnerable. state keeps ""opening up"" vaccine new groups. However, people still can't get highest priority groups. make sense say we're opening new people get vaccination still served people supposed get first. wife educator still can't get vaccine, yet moved groups supposed go educators. 

I'm back line I'm younger, essential, issue that. issue pretending we've served supposed first pretending move next groups.

I feeling things different coming months. certainly look forward return normalcy. Distribution going major bottleneck. Trying find dates parents shit show MI.  course get spread it; odds dramatically reduced. vaccinate everyone nobody get spread ask stop wearing masks together? Kinda bullshit give first doses vulnerable immediately act like pandemic rest us still dealing it. Good statement! Yes, vaccines forced upon ever forced upon us. Many us, hoping vulnerable receive vaccine ASAP. tried twice think issue stems feeling alone, talking screen, even therapy, really help me...plus tell things like read book go walk. Yay things do... Alone. Yes, part true. know trials mix match, possible could change point, currently not. political post Yeah...that's awesome. Except local news posted comments talking there's thing covid, shots sugar water. 

We got long way go... Thank President Biden real leadership. estimate conservative stormed Capitol haven’t seen data. link?

I think it’s important us quash irrational anxieties set societal norms less informed us may looking reasons refuse vaccination.

DM day you’re first shot I’ll send pizza feeling anything less ship-shape. Hey, I’m marrying two! makes afraid next pandemic, comes virus family scientists familiar with. badly shit past four years, least do. comparison much they've ramped up, everyone including experts worried Biden's promise 100m shots 100th day overly ambitious. Yesterday day 50 we're 70m. shots going faster anyone anticipated. /r/HugOfDeath Probably million deaths. mean look bad places like NY vs Florida? Plus economy might Great Depression addition deaths.  imagine conversation doesn’t go well Boomer, either. 

I’ve never encountered self-centered, entitled generation life. Every boomer I’ve encouraged get vaccinated reacted worse toddler absolutely vowed never take vaccine. writings wall aka pandemic coming end USA sudden mental health actually discussed gasp. I’m pissed never talked mental health impacts earlier aunt keeps telling she’s “been intense research” vaccines. turns research led believe vaccines made human DNA change patient’s DNA well. didn’t take long convince mother that. trump administration actually brokered deals supported much research. current administration useless. set extremely low bars move reasonable timelines (thanks trump) make feel like they’re getting done faster. Right. read plan 100 mil vaccines 100 days something like that, already pace prior presidency I'll person remind everyone pandemic control, potentially far serious crisis climate change needs focus, maybe channel resolve rather falling total abandon. 0.5% mortality rate vs. potentially 100% mortality descendants. fuck 'em right?

if nothing else hope pandemic re-educated people exponential math, 100% also applies CO2 emissions, energy use population growth. I'm petroleum engineer Federal Government that's true ""buying foreign oil"". Gas prices increasing dip demand struggling economy lead lack infastructure development domestic oil gas. also lot inertia restarting domestic oil production capital investments yet. Basically demand increasing supplies struggling keep up, leading price increases. 

I agree taking firm stance China. friend treated hostile entity. bombings Moddle East par course last... eight presidential adminstrations. Nobody shoukd surprised stratigic missile attacks part world. would oxford required vaccine sold cost licensing agreement? guys prob next I’m Utah anticipating vaccines open everyone April 1st! can’t believe quick is. January, hoping end June I’m pleasantly surprised. Correct. They’re scumbags well. crazy, sub changed based fact vast majority vulnerable fully vaccinated within next 60 days (with many already protection). 

Perhaps prefer sub tells like hear? Plenty echochambers reddit go enjoy. cdc benign cautious right now? Saying people vaccines remain inside stay small groups lol Yep help covers shitty insurance, shitty utilities, terrible rent, etc. money end day love god put savings paycheck. safety net. get car accident may $20,000. daughter still contract virus even vaccine... Mass get it. Also kinda lax (my parents qualified never checked there). problem enough vaccines. Last week entire state got 17,000 first doses fully booked seconds still delivery driving mid-March, customer fake cough (not me, admittedly) joke. amused. make happen leaning military/national guard administer honestly. efficient matters train 1000s troops give shots. COVID cause ground glass pneumonia. Sounds like got lucky, ended hospital COVID pneumonia, begging regular ol' pneumonia instead. There's exactly valid alternative that. Every country gunning pull much vaccine possible people. US better almost anyone else. trivialize saying matter, like... might well say every meal someone eats US meal go starving family developing nation. really relevant sentiment particular event, that's universal thing happens. 0 chance lockdowns, insane? Yeah - hear lot get logic - people hate US taking OBL much willing vaccinate kids? september ends. ""allow exports happen"", illegally attempt block exports. Second part true vaccines kids released summer... us live north freezing months outside enjoyable 😂😂 Priority groups older folks done way May 1st hits Yeah ok fun hiding blanket, enjoying summer thanks. Really? Getting rid Trump nice, Biden winning felt kind like eating decent turkey sandwich. reading hear covid reddit long anyone real life talking it. Everyone made fun telling prepare. asked work go ahead order us hand sanitizer masks lysol wipes, almost still 4 weeks order day. told order awhile. laughed said ""okay vile bubbles, coronavirus gonna come get us all! America ruins!"" husband made fun also worried bought bunch dry goods late January. I'm sort alarmist too, time knew right. awful feeling pit stomach like watching tornado making way town one could see it, everyone else acting like nothing coming. lonely. wonder college open in-person learning Fall semester since vaccines going available soon almost everyone? God sad. Can’t imagine buying shell life. got second vaccine week 2 weeks I’m meeting friends going dinner, wasting anymore time. people want waste lives indoors that’s one won’t let projected onto take thing granted LMAO Sign Dr. B everyone, might able get vaccine even sooner. mean dark triad types? I’ve heard lot vaccination sites ask proof employment, case don’t think you’d need worry it! can... following nearly every broadcast federal law lawyers talking it’s well within federal government's authorities 127,869,155 doses distrubted

95,721,290 doses adminterseted 

around 230-60 million people need vaccinated - around 460 doses. I’m sure plenty states easy get without bribing long meet criteria… research. unfortunately family members falling shitty facebook articles telling people getting covid vaccines think reasonable concern. feel like less risk taking novel vaccine risk catching novel SARS virus. unknown long-term impact, I'll go medicine case. wonder south park's vaccination special anything it. 💯  pharmacies? pharmacists give vaccines? perfect, definitely not, he's done well thus far opinion. Huge piece progressive legislation, vaccine deals (the merck J+J thing legit shocked me,) good cabinet. think he's actively good job, contrast Trump. Baby boomers 2.0 thought read weeks ago EU gave right sue AZ. AZ's big stick paying. I’m 30 I’m putting name list soon I’m eligible...and I’m going feel bad suffering long-term Covid symptoms since September. fun. I’m telling everyone get vaccinated. people aren’t haven’t gotten good explanation why. week’s scare-iant? going gonorrhea jsyk Israel gorgeous especially Tel Aviv ( Santa Monica / NYC ). Enjoy roaring 20s friend. Get often. 😭 Half young girls today probably don’t even know HPV anyways, let alone stopping fucking 😂 explain how? (honest question)  Would first time Theater since knives January 2020. excited back Frontline workers second line vaccination queue still wear masks long want/ Fuck can’t wait summer. Shits get rowdy.  Lmao, imagine looking raw numbers 😂 Question foreigner someone might know better... Could mean soon May, doses developing countries could increase since US would basically enough population? remember time last year reading would never know overreacted sure hell would know reacted. 

Pretty sure reacted. former company US based, though severance package benefit previous company (US based) worked acquired recent company. AFAIK, big companies tech industry offer pretty generous severance packages.

I sorry furloughed without pay. happened many people cruel unfair. hope baby healthy able rebuild savings time.  believe use 'per capita' statistics like teacher taught you. Still might handy keep couple flu season, given nicely we've held back year. Moms pass antibodies babies; getting two price one! Must nice live/work somewhere without trespassed every business fired :( risk vaccine undiscovered long term effects outweighs covid.

This first time I've seen rationale, completely stupid. 

The risk unknown long term side effects vaccine less risk unknown long term side effects covid. completely illogical stupid argument. don’t want get variants waves whatever else American, whose lost business still isn’t qualified get right now, brings tear eye.

It’s fucking year since declared pandemic. us known would get bad since Wuhan shut down. remember vacation Mexico gf January last year telling “this isn’t going end well.” 

Fast forward year later 3 working vaccines. It’s history we’re living in. doubts technology used deliver use vaccines looked long run help future children well children. stutter. talks openly... trump administration absolutely zero planned researched strategy implenting vaccine? state/country?  48 states lets goooooo Fucking finally. asking hold up. get want elderly front lines first, vaccinated people better be. Again, May 1st, there'll enough everyone get it. vulnerable included already get it. like someone 65 wil denied college kid get it... Production trend, absolute. hearing every week every week held true. We're producing vaccines day previous day. Omg go back campus fall I’d happy. person adhd online classes ranked gpa Question receiving vaccine outside state I’m employed in:

I’m college student back home CA next month so, go school Chicago. recently hired work company IL developing COVID drug, job description would interacting COVID positive patients return IL. would definitely count healthcare CA IL, would prefer fully vaccinated starting job.

Is likely get turned away try get vaccinated CA since job IL? daughter getting shot. open air beach 75% capacity restaurant. 

Ill take beach story linked dated December 30th, literal *days* unprecedented-in-human-history vaccination campaign. course going fiasco. However, three weeks later, inauguration day, things going fairly smoothly: averaging close million vaccine administrations per day, already topped 1m number times. Biden's current framework [built Trump's. clear improvements! huge stretch suggest tons vaccines would sitting unused current ramp-up matches pretty clear trend dating back Trump office, largely using framework. 

I said another comment, overarching point enough things Trump *horribly, provably* wrong need stretch comparisons hypothetical Trump rollout would mid-March. True. Id never want force something something. preclude decision selfish. still selfish getting it. want can't force you. dont highground putting peoples lifes risk. Fertility risk? Judging thought process wed better without breeding anyway. I'm done. I’m 32 definitely pro-vax. already covid jumping line soon allowed to. Jic Pennsylvania? I'm recent college grad get 2nd shot 2 weeks caregiver status. I'm beyond fucking excited everyone wants shot get shot ASAP. feeling relief felt getting 1st poke like reborn, like felt baptism. hope hell able get asap summer :)  county in? you’re comfortable sharing that’s fine. specific links find based are, I’m mainly familiar Snohomish king county. also local Facebook groups exist sole purpose finding people appointments. Additionally find appointments Nextdoor.

I’m happy help want  Imagine lit SDCC conventions gonna tech people decided social distance / wear masks also fault Trump nothing. well stated vaccine companies. Sure. Nevada still vaccinating 65, lot exposure. link county currently. Check Washoe example. can’t see Nevada gets everyone weeks. science would say open everyone anyway. not, presidential edicts way determine best. for
four years half million dead.

Link: Lol “strongest best”, sound like someone can’t put finger it. Anyways, good bro nothing wrong proud you’re from. good night   Wolstein center opening mass vaccinations next week. ton appointment available. Welcome! Trump’s new Twitter workaround: 

If president, would everyone vaccinated covid-19 *last* May! Sad! Nice. I’m mask burning party place second shot. Except Biden funneling vaccines states whose Governors effusively praise make buy doses Jared's frat bros. otherwise exactly same. Joe Biden better president Donald Trump. moved Israeli...the roll Chicago bad testing roll out

Don't worry, type bureaucrats EU. (I'm originally Europe). husband Israeli can't believe wealthy country like US can't mobilize quickly Israel. give like... 2 weeks, start see people getting vaccinated, peak frequency vaccinations hit may 1st, tail end vaccinations happen may. first read 'edible' got confused terrified 55+ prioritized fat 25 year olds Maybe got appt rural county.

I know someone city (ohio) drove hour wait pharmacy. That's necessarily wrong everything reopening lol. Still good news. vaccination rates ramping up.  Maybe one plain turkey mother else. Like I'm glad sandwich cause rim dead but... Ok... I... essential worker.... dealing 800+ people every day work... get vaccine.... Similar MD. people know 20s early 30s got first shots without eligible somehow. friend sent link text directly bypassed eligibility forms mass vaccination event held local high school. state vaccine information clearly stated they’re phase 1-c (people 65+) shouldn’t even possible get signed up, ton people did. made clear majority people signed current phase reschedule event. (From epidemiological perspective, think might better get vaccine anyway)

Meanwhile I’d trying get mom, eligible, vaccinated weeks able get appointment local Walgreens going sign process midnight dot.

What sucked watching elderly couple get turned away counter trying make appointment person pharmacist said accepting appointments online phone. internet communication savvy generations filling sign ups possibly can, making appointments feel like trying buy ps5.

This whole process definitely highlighted states inability quickly, accurately easily allocate vaccine according cdc guidelines. It’s real mess. Ex-friends “health” nuts would tell us unhealthy xyz was. mom got well would say essential oil curing diseases lived clean lifestyle. like pointed binge drinking chain smoking counter whatever healthy claims making. people wanna live caves rest us living like Buck Rodger 25th century. would say state, Iowa, pretty bad making easy make appointments. gotten 10 family members signed along mothers entire workplace(school workers). lot people state alerting new appts.  Same, lol. I've basically seen 2-3 friends person since last March, outdoors. hit 2 weeks past second shot I'm going suddenly things like normal again. simple change reported news.

News outlets government pacify weaponise citizens. get joke

But ""opened"" new stadium last year. Attendance high even team sucks ass one got go Philly fuck sign-ups meant priority folks got released publicly disclaimers.

Tons people signed thinking appointments legitimate rather cancel let go through. (They CLAIMED cancelled but... Everyone know got appointment window got one) appointment slots Ridgefield fill within 45 minutes post appointments. work time (Sundays noon). locations question me. Hope taking vitamin D3 getting plenty rest! Get well soon friend. gone hell getting 81yr parents appointment (their 2nd dose Tuesday) really given realistic time line people able get actual appointments. would say conservatively eligible May 1st, appointment would mid June.   President Biden. facilitated historic partnership two competitors Johnson &amp; Johnson Merck Merck produce JJ vaccine. yesterday announced secured 100MM JJ doses Shrinks going make bundle misery. ***WHEN***

Did read word no? That’s interesting people follow actually able get shot. Maybe didn’t realize weren’t supposed schedule yet taken anyway? summer George!! Thank you. Yea think way companies operate US, shameful. fact even adjust way operate pandemic? Basically Maki g people choose endanger life lose home. People act like that's dramatic ""first world country"", covid cases deaths. nightmare here. Yea may look pretty put together people dropping like flies.

If mom pitching in, would've lost all. imagine people lucky us loved one help them. grateful, grateful, I'm also insanely angry. dreams sort crushed, think speaks people right now. Theo great-o source this? dont want hear complain big pharma again. We're 12 months in, probably 3 months go. Cant wait show quarantine bod. far know. lots people 65 haven’t vaccinated yet. Even older 65. 

If May would different take. Israel paid double, gave shit ton data, waived liability look happened. Agreed. way, though, good times well timed. ask ""Now's good? Okay, back then? Want that?"" Things changing fast means people's short attention span get worst them.

Some still problem (we know who). I'm hoping lot say better good soon. We'll see. Can’t wait ex girlfriend time life probably kill AMC 🚀 many states distributed doses made available, they're saved people need 2nd dose. think big part eligibility isn’t wide enough yet they’re worried unvaccinated people breaking guidelines claiming vaccinated wondering. avoid unmasked people? kids make wear masks too? Nope still supposed hide houses midterms 2022. hey maybe small gatherings summer sure covid everyone knew diagnose covid? possible close timeline. 

I covid vax pneumonia vax. Would 100x wanting either illness! Hope tests turn well. Good advice vaxxers also. Quit livingst fear, take mask, go start living. without vaccine People say things never Asia. spent tons time said accurate. also wear air quality bad. vaccines practically equally effective variants. Done screaming void? right here. 40k deaths would cost dem election independent cause. BIDEN SAID HOT GIRL SUMMER Never said not? trying educate vaccines one mistakenly thinks they’re protected large gathering.

Defensive much? ironic year ago narrative unsanitary chinese people that's spread fast. killed many people ""diritier"" air. 2020 eye opener reality. motel ? Oof skeptical afraid. don’t think that’s unusual position either. CDC says you’re vaccinated get exposed don’t even quarantine, so.....  It’s hard say, it’s really race vaccinations vs increased socialization Thoughts overseas travel june? I'm USA would love travel Malaysia visit family. think would good idea wait next summer? ‘crash pads’ choose commute instead living base. It’s lay trips. It’s like dorm situation people out. don’t live there. Sounds like you’re afraid vaccine. don’t. Stay house forever you’re worried one interesting. Look Europe surging again. good percentage vaccinated vulnerable - maybe variant hits younger, healthier people?

I don’t solid view happen maybe safe little longer good?

Just found 5 different members extended family got infected Florida. One cousin got drunk went bar hopping snd karaoke. infected sister lives different condo boyfriend. affected another cousin aunt live yet third location. Family dinner, 19 people outdoor tables. safe really? 

Just like every stupid family gathering read happening past year. year careful, sick. Thanks one guy going out. 

They part 60,000 plus new cases yesterday. whatever wanna do. mandate love god. 23 Skidoo!  first time I’ve felt glad adult Thats gonna last long Texas 100% open despite science logic saying otherwise. Wow someone took econ 101 poi sci 101. feel like found leprechaun. Yeah see that. pretty different narrative EU somehow betting heavily AstraZeneca mistake, though. longer tiers cdc recommends. Sorry. trying help :/

I also heard “no show” waitlists places like Walmart Disney closed doors, something done maybe three times day time...that made obvious serious is. closed doors mandates Disney NEVER closes. Pfizer vaccine. experience dizziness brain fog? first days kind went away. Still felt dizzy week later went doctor said it’s probably vertigo. read side effects last 3 days. Don’t live fear man. want one microchip. 

I'll distract end getting it. worry, guys. I'll make confused dedicate time watching me. Meanwhile, am, U.S. servicemember stationed Germany, there's 0 plan wife get vaccinated. Media find another way reel watch 24/7. Without trump covid choice move onto new topic. 
Really shame don’t take seriously. mean, think requiring masks real downsides. Bro feels like i'm still 2020, long ass year. ramp production going make easy.

There places post thousand new appointments gone within ten minutes. lockdowns pointless. Keeping things open enforcing mask usage optimal strategy. got first dose Tuesday.

I got emotional walking truck. Deep venous thrombosis seems happen 300 times per 100000 people within year. 5 million people you’d probably find hundreds cases given week.

Cancer rates even higher. probably 30k people group get cancer year consequently 1/365th get day got shot. Sure! Maybe Google fu powerful working years 😂 Here's quote first link googling - effects commonly reported among younger people typically occur 12-24 hours vaccine administration.

There's ton things vaccine info pages even registration pages say similar things. probably ""scientific trial"" based data ""statistical sample"" data valid same. Fuck goal post moving, everyone enough it. lockdowns done hospitals weren’t overcrowded, aren’t anymore, old people wouldn’t die like flys, aren’t anymore. It’s over.  Weird I'd heard sources, parents pay back made 2020, I'm sure fucked something else :) US factories able export product - US vaccination done glut extra vaccine manufacturing capacity... yay! Oh no. Michigan wouldn’t open season vaccines till July. places eligibility problems georgia yesterday one still like week Lol shutdowns Cries Canadian Man cannot figure correct way read user name already know virus unlikely spread outdoor setting. think benefit masks would provide mass gathering post-vaccine worth downsides, venues/teams/event organizers try enforce that, I'll voting wallet. people huddled homes ones preaching others living fear afraid harmless vaccine. also ones made vaccine necessary first place. I’m glad it’s effective don’t absolutely need comply, doesn’t make smarter. knew anything vaccines you’d way worried MMR COVID vaccine. Throw ball wherever fucking want, selfish fucking prick. someone working park last March, make decisions protect staff well visitors. little knew virus behavior then, would us do? little data point. closed 40 days, made plans pivot services protect staff, reopened changes made safety (visitor orientation outside visitor center only, etc). Citizens Asian countries wear masks feeling sick go public. forced upon times. way encouraging, elect better leaders. Easier said done, course, somewhat comforting know reason pandemic got bad coordinated response early HPV shots??? Incredibly happy see HPV vaccine given boys well, teenager entire onus HPV vaccination fell onto teenage girls, barely ten years ago. Good him!! ability that. within city, able it. Hang there! know plenty folks Oregon gotten shot(s) little trouble. Keep trying. get it. downvoted? rational comment here. “Economic opportunity” .. it’s drop bucket, maybe hundred million most. goodwill donating worth much Trump.  VA also really good several places open veterans. got sign Saturday don’t risks would bump priority. Good Good news everyone, maybe small gathering 8 people July 4th! Slow spread! Wear mask! Lol cares. dont want get vaccine, dont give shit. difference vaccine vs mask: stupid dont get vaccine, die. I'm stupid dont wear mask, die. I'm getting vaccine dont worry stupid people anymore. last time actually went out? Lol. I’m categories. taking Texas residents? It’s 1/5th

64m first shots

30m cases

94m/330m

28%. idea applies non-US citizens? People work visas example drove 65 miles get mine bc it’s impossible city. Drove sticks get mine. issue scheduling got bottle booze bought March last year saved first party back. Whole thing going night sure Don’t live fear. Something tells probably told someone something far dangerous recently. There's slight difference though, US banned vaccine exports keeping country Europe still exports vaccines, since lot produced there. playing hardball like USA, would different story. Thank you. tried find info weeks ago succeed. Wonder Novavax stock piling. live time science rapidly solve problems, time ignorance rapidly create them. that's birthday, cheers!  “leadership” product culture, inverse. nearly 1m day got there. experts think ambitious? media way behind quickly ramping up. Project X bout everyones house. unfairly downvoted (I upvote both), but...

That mobility increasing necessarily going impact before. get wrong, 1,500 people died today COVID that's way much. clearly masks, social distancing, forth, look past surges, there's huge difference time.

Over 10% US fully vaccinated. number hit 20% next 6 weeks. 9% population confirmed COVID, larger amount COVID, never tested.

When look vaccinated large number fit profile vulnerable risk essential positions (front line workers). look already COVID, that's another profile well (whether essential workers risk ignoring precautions).

My point within 6 weeks, we're going 20% vaccinated least 10% already infected.  latter number could *much higher* due estimates infected never population looking things do.

There factors well, including one-way mobility. example, ""don't go visit grandma, may kill ""becomes ""it's safe come visit, quarantined, safe even not"".

Likewise, rapid testing widely available without appointment. Even cautious, makes quarantine times *much* shorter reduced risk. testing around now, really recently easily available demand.

Also, mobility may up, still many people locked going nowhere (like myself), they're fully vaccinated. words, mobility data showing ""how many miles phones moved"", ""this many phones moving many phones staying home"". such, could 30% going wild skewing results 70% locked (it's course, percentage 70% *is).*

**I say convince anyone let guard down**. We're almost finish line long marathon time vigilant, make end opposed ""we know long we're going long can"". people going endanger rest agree, smokers, obesity, drug takers drinkers alcohol.

Smokers around people could get behind banning exposing people second hand smoke, already significant legislation that. Drinkers drive drunk already laws (rightly so). 

Aside people endanger rest society, fact looks like even read comment responded to, figures. Well, that’s one foibles Liberty, isn’t it? always personal consequences. studied “vaccine” already 400 deaths associated mention long term effects come next months.

Where getting number from?   worst part (ex) coworkers friends still think reacted paranoid ""it's flu"" real... I'm glad comments section full civilized people supprtive comments. Can't tell many places article discussion comments section full selfish people.  know that, know way line. countries seeing issues. It’s mostly young foot bill pandemic. good correct lockdown measures protect elderly weak. say screw forgot consequences parts society.

This problem world. 

Mental health taken seriously enough world is. Gon lit VEGAS BABY south east Asia. gut sense might little early. Please share wisdom me. possible vaccines this? tell body this?

Also, mom dad vaccine appointment week. They're little scared. crazy they're older (60) anxious this. Theyre worried going change something body since ever used Mrna vaccines, could awful side effects years later like kidney randomly explodes (I'm dramatic here). They've heard stories people randomly getting blood disorder autoimmune disorder dying within days shot. dad blood clots really scares him. willing drive rural areas, might able get shot sooner. in-laws right getting J&amp;J vaccine tomorrow GP open appointments anybody demand lower. offer get wife appointments said sure. Jesus someone dragged feet state, that’s unacceptable. I’m glad she’s going get it. bribes would clever part. solution creates willingness child something good problem facing much bigger ability understand. Grown adults teach children rather subject will. Theo o'greato? baby boomers 2.0  It’s Texas. couldn’t believe it. understand like 70% Texans obese?? vaccinated. went local downtown farmers market last Saturday. covid would go times year mostly would big events. normal Saturday crowded shoulder shoulder part market.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  mean, masks protect others, you. stopping spread social effort, individual one. kinda like littering, way. 

I understand people like masks makes sense open large events masks small events without masks. know many eligible people bought anti-vacc propaganda don’t want it. give sane people already. I’d first moment it’s available. great, amount people encounter want get vaccine astronomical live Los Angeles. :| Coulda woulda shoulda. Hindsight. Yes people understand science always lead right answer, best answer given available data. wrong dumber Jimbob thought wearing masks stored bunker end times (although likely Jimbob wearing mask matter digress). recommend data came back actual studies determine do, also secure front lines treating patients supply depleted 300M people panic mode. could still transmit virus They're tracking number people received one doses vaccine.

The number quoted OP total number doses administered. nephews' school two entire grades teacher vacationed, caught COVID, sent kids school COVID positive. means 20-somethings competing 50-somethings supply vaccines. I’m convinced wise. Maybe vaccine supply ramping faster realize. next bottleneck vaccination clinics enough staff. Sorry downer lots people celebrating, seems like could potentially kinda bad. essential workers still waitlisted, make sense expand wait list everyone realize Virginia's phase 1b covers literally half population state. list 20 co-morbidities put 1b includes overweight. put 15 COVID pounds, congrats eligible vaccine. show ID

Honestly even seems overkill. illegal immigrant wants die, that's fine recent article linked: ‘Fauci’s comments Feb. 16 CNN: “What think vice president referring actual plan getting vaccine doses people’s arms really rather vague. mean, well-coordinated plan. Getting vaccines made, getting shipped Operation Warp Speed okay. believe vice president referring process actually getting doses people. something get much better organized getting community vaccine centers, getting pharmacies involved, getting mobile units involved.”’

So no, don’t think it’s huge stretch say vaccines would sitting unused wasn’t organized plan administer them. Also, 1 million people per day were, said before, largely healthcare workers elderly care homes. Easy enough deliver vaccines mass areas like that, need scale huge way reach general population. Vaccines would still rolling out, course, pace? think it’s fair say wouldn’t quickly now. initial point. I’m glad agree Trump plenty non-hypothetical failures could discussing. One thing learned may 6-8 weeks pop point. whole “wait two weeks” never case macro scale. It’s 1-2 gen cases it’s 10-15 generation cases exponential growth seems pop at. 

This gives hope even regions headed blindsided surge time get lot shots arms it’s building. Added huge shift pleasant weather throughout US promising well.

It interesting see.  I’m excited good vaccines are.  I’m also bit jaded “mission accomplished” talk get go seems like seeing things shade optimism doesn’t seem land us right side things point.

I’m cautiously optimistic. got crazy involved election. Text banking, sending postcards Georgia voters, donating, everything could think within means. nasty cancer, healthcare much concern. 

I'm getting first Covid vaccination Monday, go full days without thinking politics. predicted die sometime Trump administration. 

Watching lose *twice* impeached *twice* far ever hoped see. tumor grows again, die knowing country totally lost sight stood for. really forgetting kids this(I know kids can’t 16-18 yo can).  may long since test antibodies donate blood! world live ""duh media"" said shaking hands would kill you? June 20th here! Feels really good. else cases go continue climb up?  circumstance would obviously exception then. normal situations see nothing wrong continuing mask up. Mad Florida reopen since last October better restriction happy states like California NY sad accomplish basically nothing year.  lot us directed pediatricians school officials get HPV vaccine middle school us sexually active yet. 15 years ago I'm sure that's still case many places. It’s damn French tongue kiss It’ll probably become another Cold virus honest. speculation Russian flu 1893? one current Corona viruses part cold family. appreciate comment. live without car Seattle saves much money. everyone can, trying change that. Oh I’m aware that! teenager messaging surrounding HPV put sole responsibility girls prevent. Teenage boys weren’t expected encouraged get vaccine. I’m glad see that’s changing. Yea know sound dumb articles headlines read, thought reinfection pretty common thing basically we're fucked. already create viruses, complex ones nature throws us. know tech going change much front. Perhaps it'd make delivery easier, actual creation may still difficult. Million vaccinations day started Trump Mfw I'm 17:
👁👃👁 Around parts weren’t even small last year so..  Million vaccinations day started Trump We're close defeating virus that's restricting lives year.

Normies: let's spread STDs illnesses Million vaccinations day started Trump could recommended make face masks home. many wrong recommendations early different health authorities world. kidding? Million vaccinations day started Trump Hang man. Hope you’re able get back social life quickly post vaccine. Loneliness would tough. Would have? fuck think got here? let virus kill half million us run wild securing enough doses ahead time anyone help explain need do? son June 2020 recieved stimulus money since last time filed taxes born. filing taxes week told add child stimulus check amounts deduction. Million vaccinations day started Trump


If Biden would likely like California NY think, another redditor put it, “D-Day” moment it’s responsibility drive public discourse frightening people compliance public health directives they’ve collectively decided upon even though evidentiary basis guidelines pretty poor. 

And vaccines public getting fed up, they’ve got crank fear 11 lest lose grip narrative. Could less clear meant? Hell yes, loaded Black Friday deal got free slice cheesecake every $25 CF gift cards. Can’t wait.

Edit: well shit, redeem free slice March 31st. guess I’ll taking fat ass 31st. I’ve waited long enough. Real leadership seems communist something. Looking forward whining alt reality folks. It’s kind weird seeing comments thread calling parties gatherings, acting like beginning general pop vaccinations cure covid something. 

Covid doesn’t magically disappear May 1st. 

The vaccine doesn’t give “maximum immunity” someone put it.

Covid still transmissible vaccinated people.

The danger large gatherings throwing precautions virus mutate groups. Thats “herd immunity” doesn’t really work. Million vaccinations day started Trump bad take. Trump's mishandling virus got us are. assuming Democrat would bungled worse Republicans dismantled stuff place fight pandemic. Holy fuck. Trump President, vaccinations going like now, would saying “Trump nothing this, it’s science governors!” happens time guy president, give 100% credit. never checked see state reside in.  didn’t even show id.  registered online showed appointment.  got coworkers green cards vaccinated today also.  Louisiana residents. apparently also think thing stopping teenagers copious amount sex relatively small chance they'll get cancer.

That's either absolutely reason copious sex copious amounts sex parents denial. problem message several months people felt duped. Delaware Fuck signing for?? nothing tells is. Ok feel like I'm going get ripped new asshole this, something can't stop thinking about. Viruses one nature's answers overpopulation species. keep finding ways vaccinate everything, dramatically reduce population (which doubt happen, going able convince people biological children), like royally fucked?

Please take wrong way. I'm antivax, I'm getting first shot soon let me. think vaccines miracle, I'm relieved parents get them, can't get worry head. fully vaccinated absolutely reason wear mask show. Yes, love guys! party even half good little dudes I’ll happy! :D Million vaccinations day started Trump Million vaccinations day started Trump Yes. Thats typically decide problem work first competent problem solver. Yes, choice. also noticed young women Korea wearing friend told it’s they’re wearing makeup. Kind like fashion choice, black, “cool” masks.

Either way, nothing mandatory. Million vaccinations day started Trump Jesus I’m fucking tired accustoming life damn virus. It’s year, shouldn’t still worrying point. Vaccine can’t come quicker People live high CoL areas Funny, saw nearly identical comment earlier thread. Maybe Chinese/Russian troll farm? ""But authority"" ~ annoying question hear Whitehouse Briefing Room almost daily consequences going draw this? governments going start taking pandemics serious? going prepared stop travel certain countries virus breaks locally? reason get it. Today heard two girls Wal-Mart mocking door greeter offering masks ha sure mean call dumb like 90% people think smarter average statistic. Good day many 30th birthdays friend group could celebrate. take bit longer Germany things back normal sure life absolutely insane. Man things really looking joking too.

Don’t narrowminded. Europe large piece land, lot different people.

Enjoy summer though. happy guys; guys got good! You’ve already Covid times, tests inaccurate, think it’s going “be over” suffer unknown side effects gene therapy injection kids, think in-laws caused it. 

You sound sane. 

&amp;#x200B;

New guidelines came days ago! still recommend maintaining precautions around high-risk unvaccinated people, making assumption OP low-risk. guideline referencing second bullet point. relate hard comment. Well sucks suck that's what's gonna happen crying help. laughed hard spit coffee 100%

There's going much celebration whoopie minute major plummets cases happening suddenly pregnancies maternity wards handle might let vaccinated expats/citizens back in, though, even don’t open full tourism. amen that. Even though already see clinics jam packed people trying get vaccine. Realistically, see access end june. Maybe beginning july, lucky enough Russian, fully vaccinated sputnik. bad culture vaccinations general. People want get vaccinated anything sputnik. example, small number population gets flu shots. think parents ever that. stupid attitude ""well get corona thats inevitable"".
I made mom go get vaccinated (wasn't easy). working dad atm lol Give week media magically discover another new “variant” claim evades Pfizer’s sterilizing immunity Zero masks, crowded church. least rich famous people got :/ See, problem: Americans say ""The US greatest country,"" time we're joking. Y'all legitimately believe better us. Oh well; guess wipe eyes summer 2021. see Fauci optimistic type. Yes. said life return relative normalcy may. could easily move goalposts way november, wanted to. think would insane part. better believe tell 100% done wearing mask. people forcing wear (when outdoors) two siblings. 
If roommates, would probably dropped mask now. Vaccine vaccine. prob would still wear indoors. know. Inside malls grocery store Italy too.. mean look many vaccines given?! curve shooting roof compared January.  Biden shouldn’t direct State...States direct Biden People Direct States. True story Amazing happens true leader White House People forget Dr's wrong before. Remember took forever admit airborne. mean month... ago. Dude work Papua New Guinea half year, worked sub saharan Africa, I'm well aware. crappy places I've been, generators norm power kicks off. They're big expensive they're hundred bucks home depot. We're running deep freezes. act like backyard diesel genny massive expense, I'm sure planet that's case. fact, power I'm using right backup generator, made gold jeez Louise Economists saying months pandemic causing kind pent-up everything that's priming us second roaring-20s soon flood gates open 

Because people going nuts celebrating months end going dump tons money certain sectors (when adjusting population)

so less 10,000 per day. Yes, and?

The American government's first foremost priority American people...anything else would treasonous disgusting. 

Once American's vaccinated, ship ones we're making rest world, hell free even, care honest...but America, probably Canada Mexico since share land borders, taken care of. shorter say. know appreciate actually BioNTech-Pfizer. Username checks out. saying is, indestructible? ""By Easter, goes away, like miracle""  :-/ Nah, winning majority senate biggest deal. reminder, ZERO REPUBLICANS voted bill. ZERO. NADA. 

It's doomsday cult through, thank fuck Democrats house senate now. mean barely going down?

* Cases fallen 8k 3k
* New daily severe cases fallen 200 Deaths fallen total severe cases 1200 625 AZ's proections worth paper written on. gave easy way spot good bad.  Dont forget also lot people rose occasion ans right thing, many went beyond help neighbors pandemic Grownups made scream before, haven’t they... Social distancing masking continue 8-10 years still. Don’t get hopes up. funniest comment I've seen month personally know 2 people got reinfected. I'm exactly sure unusual is. Especially UK variant stronger might reinfect easier no.

Israel's cases fallen 8k 3k still going (they plateau 2 weeks). drop severe cases deaths never stopped.

The reason plateau kids. 30% Israeli population 0-16, weeks ago went back person school. 50% new cases 0-19, contribute next nothing hospitalization, nothing deaths. OK mispeak. 95 million doses, second doses. still 60 million individuals country adult population 200 million. lol? Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson coming around corner. possible take four get super mega covid 19 immunity? one reads beyond headline. EU ordered earlier, albeit day, used stuff friends. don’t need inject weird shit body. say still transmit COVID anyway, mor likely killed scorpion pathetic pandemic. Please teenager fun. Knocks trees, tables, plants nearest hundred miles.  That’s kind point Maybe world, even met anyone like obama skin color. plenty hate about. Doesn’t matter aren’t enough vaccines...

People acting like means vaccinated spring - realize single digits vaccinations, directive won’t change overnight? That’s good one read single newspaper Jan Feb? Pfizer encountered huge delays EU supply. commission simply found political traction criticising AZ. 

Even included Pfizer vaccines UK would ahead EU rollout (the split roughly 50/50). pure smoke mirrors commission - fucked need held accountable. quite simple - states de-risked scaling production socialising it, others didn't, first group far vaccines dish out. think biggest problem disinformation. day people still think cloth masks protect selves. people understood act like idiots. Nothing good... also used defense production act speed production, worked JJ Merck speed further. also organized vaccine delivery states would know advance much getting when, allowing plan efficient.

If think we'd anywhere near level Trump charge delusional. Amen aren't? Cases gave fallen 8k 3k still going (a day, weekly average). worker forced work businesses follow good practices? matter many times dumb anglos parrot irrelevant talking points. wont become relevant.  private comapnies cant export shit US bans export. yes, EU exporting delivering. Welcome ‘murica I'm also getting AZ vaccination Monday getting seriously worried... That’d nice Fauci infectious disease expert. Mental health isnt wheelhouse That's true all, number new cases among ultraorthodox line % population (10% new cases, 9% population).

Neither ultraorthodox anti vaxx general. Though small sub communities are. anti lockdown restrictions pretty much ignored lot regulation, pre vaccine led lot infections midst boosted December-January wave, rushed vaccinate elderly eventually brought case number down.

It's kids (50% new cases) due schools reopening person, lesser effect anti vaxx sentiment among Arabs, responsible 45% new severe cases 18% population. Lol it’s funny, every surge there’s pers saying “just wait two weeks” joke surge actually happen, maybe two weeks later. case another surge based happened Europe b117 became dominant variant leads compelling case another surge. Hopefully doesn’t happen could trauma response. moderate mental retardation. Overall decent year. hated fact missed year college. (due remote remote college bad count education.) spent many years homeless, 2020 brought lot money bank, well fixed credit score, bit education, stable job time. also Japan 4 months time, lot fun!  

Overall life changed lot better. wish covid didnt make study remotely. sad Well put. people seem forget pharmaceutical companies scientist pushed dangerous drugs many times before.  Dont waste breathe. tell them, living fear. letting virus control life letting scientists government inject hastely developed vaccine.

- Source normally non antivax Father. (vaccines never issue COVID politicized, even got annual Flu vaccine). store yesterday since rollout U.K. high, it’s getting busier, since supermarkets thing allowed open, it’s even busier that! found starting panic attack busy, coming guy worked music whole life, crowds nothing me, started freak leave. guess hadn’t realised much damage year done me. less 10,000 cases day upset people think 300,000 cases 10,000 cases? 100% this. everyone planet able willing gets vaccine.

Yeah, ""and willing"" part ... recently learned fecken **polio,** we've vaccines 70 years, declared eradicated yet. Mainly diehards couple nations, want Afghanistan one, refuse take ... basically ""we want Yankee microchip juice"" level reasoning need anal swab testing best deterrent. good idea? I'm worried people need get trampled. benefit 10x relationship us you,

Hahahhahahahahhahahah, americans certainly brainwased creatures walk earth. comes surprise absolutely one. time last year media full terrifying Covid news / people speculating worst / China terrifying videos coming out, Spring Break still raged on. young people fed restrictions lockdowns gone year now, ontop told chance death infantile, I'd imagine going huge influx Spring Breakers wanting party hard possible.

Shame really, we're close end pandemic see light end tunnel, fear tunnel collapsing behind us run fast hoping tunnel collapse ontop us make side. Here's hoping make side post pandemic nonsense behind us. Uh plenty basis statements 

How many times big pharmaceutical companies caught lying side effects downplaying them? 

Drugs passed fda testing longer timeframes found later road cause problems. 

The people developed drugs people let pass inspections also scientists. 

Im antivaxxer, vaccines I’m generally pro-vaccine, “trust scientists” argument wins one. looks like czech republic.  stats show show 300,000 new cases day Same...schooling home college net +25 lbs past 13 months...eating less/healthier going walks daily walk shit off... feels good President *try*. know everything he's behind scenes, I'm sure shady dealings going on, pretty clear cares actually beating virus. least he's willing listen people around care, say last guy. Worse that, would “KILLARY KILLED 40,00 people!!” I’m entirely sure you’re arguing, mRNA’s vaccines in-fact fail B.135?

No, arguing bad practice guess efficacies comparing vaccines performed another metric especially bad practice comparing different platforms. assertion effective could well turn true, think fair say fact-based validly extrapolated data vaccines. That's science works. provided example AZ study SA. Using logic requiring solid data estimate efficacy comparing vaccines efficacies original variant, come conclusion AZ would efficacious actually is. Conclusion - logic faulty surprising. indeed can't predict efficacies like that's find clinical trial demonstrating one dose AZ’s vaccine effective one dose Janssens please link it.

It's one Lancet papers AZ vaccine. That's like main publication reliable source data AZ vaccine. random testing. would thought come across data already. think Ramasamy et al one. not, Lancet publication last 3 months. somewhat important factor condition clinical trials see drug fail general population (for variety reasons) succeeded clinical trials

I mentioned real world data said AZ's efficacy questionable. not. questionable even going clinical trial only. trial however include many older participants one would liked, data still good. Real world data case absolutely relevant fair look at, literally shows exact efficacy clinical trial alleviates issue clinical trial data statistically significant enough. bad practice rely real-world data use support clinical trial data, *especially* alligns clinical trial data perfectly. conclusive controlled data AZ’s vaccine 62.5% effective, comparing data vaccines clinical trial environment

Actually, also bad practice, trials tested 12 week regimen, showed efficacy 81.3% literally regimen used, literally makes sense look efficacy figures regimens used in. conclude AZ performance demonstrably worse environment used test vaccines.

That's another bad conclusion. clinical trials real-world data showing extremely efficacious better vaccines metrics. UK, Pfizer AZ given one dose regimen, AZ literally shown efficacious preventing symptomatic covid also efficacious preventing severe disease. Wanna look clinical trial data, even though there's absolutely nothing wrong looking real world data using supplement trial data perfectly line? one dose regimen shown efficacious JnJ's one dose. agree suspect, also believe (given clinical trial data) AZ’s vaccine likely among least effective environment B.135 dominant.

But that's contradictory. SA's trial source data vaccine's efficacy SA variant. find trial sus (perfectly reasonable) nothing go then. basis discussion Im using different set parameters making assertions, ones believe provide greater degree comparability. don’t see either us convinced since you’re using less uncontrolled data

Well, explained using clinical trial data vaccines defeats thinking really responded that. Also, think fair say I'm using uncontrolled data. mostly relied published peer-reviewed data discussion vaccines' efficacies SA variant. also reliad clinical trial data AZ's efficacy different categories. actually seemed unaware papers data. actually one drawing premature conclusions based literally data. useful data Pfizer's efficacy SA variant.  Doom porn good. Same. come say ""no one 30 july"" 2 weeks later say ""oh way young people go back work tourists coming lol""

Very epic rollout timeline got going truthfully pulled mask sneeze times. I've done accident mentally feel something face, need get way sneeze arm?? I've since gotten used recognizing it, probably looked like asshole people I'm sure. bunch BS. virtually everything said comment wrong.

1. Everyone ""allowed"" take vaccine massively encouraged. None Israeli civilians ""oppressed"" take political propaganda elsewhere please.
2. 50% new cases among kids, case across demographics. happening Israel high birth rate, lot unvaccinated kids (30% population 0-16). schools reopening person, virtually impossible stop.
3. Arabs significant anti vaxx sentiment, lot cases community, despite Israeli efforts pushing vaccination stations neighborhood small village resolution. anti vaxx sentiment shifted somewhat many got vaccinated recently effect mini COVID wave experienced. means basically can’t transmit vaccine. havent seen another country report 300,000 cases day (thankfully). someone else beaten record? favorite people say diet vitamins protect COVID, apparently weak protect vaccine. What?! BioNTech massive research mRNA last 20 years. focus cancer one willing invest mRNA vaccines. good interview Curevac founder problematic. ""he"" context?

Why specifically choose baseball stadiums?

Strange comment 

I Ireland Study Abroad trip dreams.

I saving money since 15 go. year high school lowest point life due lot reasons, go dark path life. Mom saved convincing worked hard enough, could get Study Abroad like did. family Ireland (mom American) dad owns family home Galway, able afford go since 4.

Studying abroad become new pipedream. pulled back grades brink next two years able get insane scholarship first choice college. 

When finally got Ireland... man, like dream. always felt calling place, made wonderful. made way.

 worked many summers busting ass carpenters, bricklayers, painters, ect. making enough money pay college trip. take second granted. time Limerick, made fastest strongest friendships life. met girl too. got drink first legal beer. got go first nightclub. yet, while, feeling virus China going become problematic people thought.

I right. coming Saturday marks full year since leave Ireland.

It shitty year since then. family survived it. luckier many people regard. Things getting better. 

God bless ya. Snip snip doesn’t stop pee pee burn burn Read article. Follow science. germany like :maybe april start vaccinate doctors, maybe. Knee surgeries hip replacements artificially capped keep costs  emergency procedure done immediately.

Manitoba 20k doses day supply consistent.  hasn’t yet. equitable distribution doses taking account factors ethnicity 

That sounds illegal. people heard equal protection clause? got denied life saving vaccine skin color would sue. Millenials literally early 20s late 30s. plenty clubs bars. Aww...did hurt bunch antimaskers feelings. Seems like majority regulars anti-mitigation subs molded group via knowing better thinking must *really* mainstream opinion get downvoted negative responses sub repeating anti-mitigation talking points. 

As why, guess put lot time energy anti-mitigation year subs still passionate pushing views things 100% like pre-pandemic. people content things going motivated visit sub multiple times day share points view talking points every little thing. small percent extreme anti-mitigation people try portray everyone agree them, try find comments, they're like 1 per 50 comments here. sure getting point.

When look evidences (e.g., New Zealand COVID-19 cases report cases related milk powder plant), China's claim dubious best. Many evidences point fact China lying. part China's COVID-19 propaganda campaign. absence risking deaths WW-2 we'll trust best estimate results. domestic vaccine production 

Sorry clarify -- saying, production mRNA type vaccines like Moderna Pfizer formulas, right? saying, vaccine production kind, flu shots, MMR whooping cough polio shots school children? that's case, what, buy contract U.S. companies provide vaccines? (I wouldnt think so, IDK) think study Israel showed nursing mothers pass immunity child. Congratulations! document personal, QR code personal data. forged, easily.

Thing is, go restaurant one bothers verify it. opening membership gym. depends bit. Wonder many people die drunk driving normal. i'm stuck third world country barely getting vaccines all. fun. People dying bad ;-) Uh, no, many people know still pretty great years personal lives aside pandemic. generalization/assumption makes feel better, power you. offense.. point.. non-vaccinated harm get everyone else gets it. know muster pity anymore. Texan here. basically opened since announced vaccines lol. Nothing gonna change start Fill finish done Netherlands AZ vaccines used UK produced there. says 2nd dose 73% less likely test positive. seems far short claims 90%+ prevention asymptomatic cases/spread Pfizer/Moderna/Israel. missing something? You’re not. see. Thank much. learned I'm describing called ""the original antigenic sin"". Amazing name 😂 one booth vaccinations, there's 3 techs 2 pharmacists able give them. whoever free currently it. 100 better fit workflow. could probably fit 300 day going back back without stopping unfortunately phones stop ringing people need medicine too. They're supposed make everyone wait 15 minutes (just extremely unlikely case adverse reaction), lol Arm little sore. far good holy shit rips need form signed doctor, reports indicate one checking papers much less checking veracity what's them. least 2020 give us interesting quotes 

March: Gov Coumo Excuse arrogance New Yorkers . . . [but] even think going bad countries.” I'm kind problems parents. Knowing them, long know handful people something they'll follow. I'm hoping happen case shit Great Depression comes right lol It’s amazing. Theo thee-o GREAT-o

Just guessing :) It’s bumped mid May everyone getting first dose second delayed 12 weeks.  variants gonna cause rude awakening next months. Yet we’re going full open. Foolish. way. title article misleading. stopped using certain AZ vaccine batches week see results investigations EU states. agreement Trump Biden nothing vaccine, right? wait til fall? reopen month summer break huge portion population month away getting vaccinated? feel like sub devolved people arguing things opening good not. one knows one expert we'll see happens. Arguing shit. flat bull shit trust emergency approved novel technology mRNA vaccine. Death rests high??? Compared who? saying two provinces biggest population didn’t well small states? comparing small states small provinces essential lot pandemic Atlantic bubble.

Canada could done better country border also happened biggest trading partner intermixed economy, fucks spectacularly caught cases. first months Canada cases traced back essential non essential travel.  Canada would done far better done hard shit the. Order travel blunt effects

Canada feeling smug faired far far better us. haven’t cross 900k cases 2xxxx deaths yet.  deaths long term care homes totally fucked response on. Lol wrote exact thing world news got downvoted. Youre 100% correct what? quarantining wearing mask group mix vaccinated unvaccinated? like idea talking about. Theo Theo Greato Good bot. Today party, tomorrow occupy Poland. Q helluva drug. cells take mRNA decodes spike build spike protein. way virus infection would force cells do. immune system reacts. That’s birthday! I’m hyped America: Hi Mexico come Mexico: !No mames America: brought favorite, COVID Mexico: Lo siento, Tio 'Sam' -- mi casa es su casa.

f.t.f.y.  O:-) sarcastic, donate it? Wipe drive, reinstall OS, give someone would otherwise unable get one. J&amp;J Astrazeneca use method vector Virus.

But J&amp;J seems somehow better designed compared Astrazeneca. higher efficiency one shot.  think mainly get Democrat moderates, primarily Joe Manchin, board. needs relatively high amount spread get significant variants. mutation would wildly different evade enough vaccine effectiveness. case numbers keep decreasing, variants worse see would non existant Credit credit due. voted duress top choice ~~was stabbed back~~ lost fair square even relief bill , well, degrees magnitude better whatever passed leadership oath keepers white supremacists need worry about. Republicans state level creating voter suppression laws. know win future elections keeping minorities voting. Lol holy shit dumb comment. CDC literally said don’t quarantine. It’s fine. Read article. free beer! can’t serious. have. long there's need masks groups, impossible tell vaccinated large group people running things everywhere, I'll wear mask. I'm intelligent kind care helping people myself. Please!!!! tired ready simple pleasure going eat amusement park without worrying We’ll see goes. Supply chains problem. really doubt adults able get vaccine May 1st. Absolutely stunned saw it. imagine they’ll change tune tomorrow Go read book lib   I’m sure. We’ll see goes. resident. friend come month pay $250 airport Or, get vaccine. Still better Biden would ever be. June would make hell lot sense now. crap ton vaccine coming pipeline like weeks.  know effective. don’t understand people can’t see actually something different time around.  first time obvious value little patience. states dining open enough capacity want go eat go eat, weather turning, sporting events talking getting fans back stands. don’t understand what’s hard get vaccines kick Covid teeth also persistently high baseline many people getting Covid day good even know doesn’t include many elderly people mix.  Covid neutral inconsequential people 60.  It’s less likely detrimental.  

If office fir instance filled people 60 can’t vaccinated yet loosen restrictions shove conference rooms bring back office virtual work? probably 6 weeks away vaccinated wish go do. let’s shove together get Covid weeks happens. Additionally get Covid also multiple employees can’t work least 10 days. understand quite well, think it’s completely tone deaf suggest excess vaccines middle deadly pandemic “economic opportunity”. 
What’s next? going auction highest bidder? Or, know, participate reality wear mask need around people, like pants. difficult. mom made classic stupid arguments hear mRNA vaccines Jannsen vaccine came pointed way since uses traditional delivery system gets flu shot every year.

Now I'm finding nothing vaccine delivery system entirely fact quarantine new boyfriend fully board ""bill gates, pedophiles, martial law"" bullshit. nice find lied scared share stuff accepting tolerant all. sister's hand cool telling stuff blocked phones socials. sure gonna work out. Well avoided warring 10s time around hopefully skip 30s 40s well lol Go rides eat elephant ear? Understandable. Congratulations first shot! twice population New Zealand continue setting bars already track met anyway*

Fixed you. Get justification virus could still spread infect people. ""enjoying"" wearing one feeling like social interactions impeded really burden, especially something valuable general health, wellbeing, safety everyone around you.

You much allowed ask wear mask, order argue good faith accept reasons given come argument beyond general dislike.  Literally actually. It’s prime demographic (24-30 like said) that’s ready cut loose party like crazy group people straddle line Millennial Gen Z (which already arbitrary line is). top that, I’ve seen people extend Millennial way people born 98 even (some like unofficially claim “if remember 9/11 you’re Millennial), it’s really arbitrary anyway. dividing line every generation change always pretty blurry.   watch read Conservative publications often, Biden getting respect massive strides cricketville? tried. There's many people trying appointments go fast can't even get website load. one location 50-75 appointments 3 counties worth people.  really hard give vaccination, there's millions home health aids, LPNs, RNs even medical nursing trainees could easily step supply high enough. would much worried supply, looks like heading much right direction, people qualified stick needle person's arm.  Like someone Twitter said, Covid homebody still one two places go.

Working home alright definitely feel like lack person interaction affected feel toward work. can't perceive much workload compared colleagues, difficult get touch go difficult case, can't really chitchat lighten mood, etc. help workload tripled past year I'm everyone suddenly work home connect VPN magnifies client's infrastructure issues. Yankees allowed full attendance opening day, would packed stadium careful city country. Yup!  twitter recommend following account notifications on. It’s many people know NJ found appts I'm eligible group yet. Young age comorbities essential job. I'm back line figured June would optimistic reason quick turnaround. Testing manufacturing agree with. Developing vaccine nearly done long this, mentioned proven. AZ vaccines used Eu produced EU - Europeans. expect they're lazy good job. I'm calling American kind antagonist garbage looks like typical race-to-the-bottom tribalism plaguing world right now. announcing you’re going say it, saying it? Call around see find, it’s kind numbers game tbh. might want start question capital letter end question mark. seems like uneducated. Good. need them. We’re using *yet*. They’re final phases approval likely arms April. Development also heavily tax payer subsidized well. creates complications domestic optics export contracts delivered. 

Related well, J&amp;J started youth trials week go well they’ll one approved kids. would mean AZ doses would needed take extra slack created diverting J&amp;J kids’ arms. give away doses run risk perfect storm earmarking J&amp;J kids time AZ gets approved use, leaving us shortfall. v rather giving Europe I'd give Mexico somewhere Caribbean closer ability produce vaccines.

How letting private company decide fullfill contracts?

If allowed full capacity March Madness it'd packed

By fall majority people vaccinated, stadiums packed. even question archive it: idea. specifics. least Houston, Walmarts almost universally Moderna appointments open sharply midnight (or 2hr change time zone). Join local vaccine hunter facebook group, I'm sure someone able help you. Nice! second one scheduled? level outright racism fear-mongering towards Russia sub quite awful well. really though, vaccine isn’t approved children yet. well half required number since takes two shots per person. get half need half year second half year take us right schedule. 

Thank confirming hypothesis correct adverse remark. Move UK then, byebye nobody cares. Nope, flawed is, USA democracy, single person charge 8 years series checks balances place make sure get powerful. Newspapers media allowed publicly call lies manipulations without fear reprisals screw things badly people get rid them. 

I'm pretty sure ""Chairman"" Xi declared president life anyone China publicly criticizes parties policies disappears.

That's pretty big difference.

I live USA way. I’d like think appealing sense community empathy would impactful throwing cold facts accusations selfishness them. Uggggh need vent! Effing Walgreens. thought finally made vaccine appointment. Selected appointment dose 1 - next. Selected appointment dose 2 - next. ""We sorry, due demand times longer available.

Seems bit hasty. version vaccine studying? british, european, indian? looking blueprint saying possible/likely? Mazeltov baby! 

I've actually wanted go Israel years, might great way burn air miles I've got sitting unused account year. us we’ll get $2000.” have.

And haven't, think mean. Less $2,000 changed rules goes smaller set people. Get summer body ready gentlemen. good news Ohio announced 18 mass vaccination sites yesterday. Ohio trying get appt? CVS rite aid may appt options here. tried replicate gym setup home miserable. half bedroom taken crap dont even use isnt EU would accept that

And think EU could it? send strongly-worded letter (which I'm sure White House diplomats snicker promptly file ""not important""), that's it. originally concerned thinking ""It's new! bad side effects?"" really thought it, benefits outweighed \*possible\* risks, healthy, 31f, realized really anything lose! already kids fertility fears, underlying conditions. small mental hurdle overcome I'm glad did. Yep, exception UK, think Europe might open till much later year. Best national round applause (/s) making $80k+ year complaining.

As someone makes hair $80k got first two checks got excluded one, yeah, I'm mad too. That's mortgage payment got taken away me. No. wasn't. groundwork done. effort indeed extraordinary. opinion, opinions everyone involved, entire scientific community. echo sentiments. resentful towards exactly? Masks helped catching virus spreading it. sure Biden included picture absolutely nothing this? We're anyway!? literally calling Americans ignorant subhuman fucks.

really? source? states par hit April?

Common tactic Biden seems set goals already attained take credit. That's concern sure. specifically replying someone talking people want get vaccine. posted elsewhere 5 members extended family, living 3 different condos, got infected Florida year careful in
NYC. One cousin got infected drinking karaoke managed spread family gathering outdoor restaurant. 

Just eating outside isn’t protection someone group infected.

Please stay careful enjoying vacations! mean private company EU bullied around destroyed credibility product?

The one EU politicians kept dumping force obey. politicians beg people accept vaccine?

We've done ourselves. well, leaders fucked really need 60 unless Florida think feel immense weight right you. Sometimes victory getting bed putting one foot front other. Things get better! prediction AZ won’t even bother applying approval US. don’t need it, FDA knows trial damn mess. Remember [cartoons like pushed front page Reddit every single day months? Remember Canadians kept calling Americans “plague rats” “never” want open borders again? 

Americans want stay country now. Pleas please tell rich they’re welcome come get vaccinated either. really don’t want get exposed careless heartless Canadians. Oof say that?

I’m saying spiral aren’t careful, vaccine isn’t instant immunity 🤷🏻‍♂️ Here's limited number infections Israel caused so-called South African variant - known B.1.351 - able evaluate effectiveness variant. evidence, that's countries recently halted vaccination. still may turn something else though.  wholesome.

Private companies providing vaccines UK purchased fulfilling contracts. produced plants within EU, owned EU all. Said plants also using ingredients imported UK well. UK exporting 0

Nobody purchased vaccines plants within UK... UK zero plants funded itself. somebody wants vaccines produced UK welcome fund like UK did. defective AZ batches EU up

It’s shame, expected massive logistical effort. British covid variant rising EU

Where comes zero relevance, mentioned justify anglophobic rhetoric. nasty variant could crop Spain today, trying use stick beat Spanish would ridiculous. Yet course, EU selfish bad guy.

Seizing goods purchased one nation private company bad thing do. understand gravity situation, especially exact thing promised happen?  might different. check vaccinefinder see specific store has. Going dates always correct appointments 4 weeks apart got pfizer live Iceland work tourism. would say late June tourism back. tourists five day quarantine landing going drop 1st may countries low infection rates. Also right EU citizens vaccinated recovered virus visit Iceland without test quarantine. Im sure apply rest world soon. Summer months high season tourism Iceland everybody industry desperate summer turn good. bad thing vaccinations going slowly us. today 80+ year olds first responders vaccinated. government saying around half population vaccinated July. good thing though country pretty much virus free right now. feel confident make trip July. don’t know country, least 4 southern states it’s easy get vaccine want regardless restrictions. call set appointment. don’t understand anyone even cares. AZ isn’t even approved US so, would US want keep them?

And isn’t AZ vaccine shunned many EU countries anyways becoming clear causes blood clots? Cool? guess? Thank thoughtful response. points good ones. 

You summed basic feeling well last paragraph. ""Now time vigilant."" right, make end. biggest concern many people have, minds, replaced ""can make it"" sentence ""have made it,"" fact absolutely still blow buy extra year pain, suffering, restrictions. Gonna rager. Stop. Nothing turn American faster telling forced something. want vaccine, even feel defenses rise idea. 

There many ways persuade people. starters, offer financial incentives like cash. Maybe businesses donate tickets movie whatever. 

Maybe push “mandatory” someday, vaccine long time mountain evidence pressure safe highly desirable. Public Health Scotland University Glasgow assessed 300,000 NHS workers December 8 – first day vaccination Scotland – March 3 give first direct knowledge jabs impact Given people living healthcare workers could also catch virus sources, 30 per cent figure low doses inoculation, least 54 per cent less likely pass virus. really want camera Lebron James May 1st. “Will receiving corona virus vaccine today?” stories like these, I’m *really* interested seeing MSM powers twist vaccine privileges appeasing weary minority communities. Sooner later, dangerous culture idea meet real world problems. I’m sorry ever even enforced, like Link? Tell problem white HR guy fires black woman vaccinated I’ll start thinking getting board

There problem long they're firing everyone vaccinated.

Stop using serious issues try delegitimise stuff agree with. know yesterday, good trick learned *always* early go Google maps, set going, tap kabab menu tap ""set depart arrival time""

I set arrival times always 15 minutes early I've late *anything* since started this. Yeah, I’m fairly extreme extrovert (I used option work home 2 days week never commute short like seeing people office, example) working home exactly year now, I’m like “do actually want go anywhere”?

For me, introverted means really crave interaction. I'm perfectly happy day day out. family member dies. happened 500k times last year. substantially less likely though Isn’t discrimination? applaud taking time constructing lengthy post.

However, none studies prove (at all) vaccine induced immunity works better natural immunity. reason think it’s same. Hell, apparantly aren’t effective variants first thought (and natural immunity might also be), still effective. Natural immunity apparently effective Oxford vaccine.

Natural immunity reduces spread, severely reduces symptoms upon (possible) reinfection much vaccines unless actually read study says otherwise, that’s main consensus. 

Then there’s question vaccinating whole bunch people already antibodies good idea, maybe even potentially harmful. 

I’d like think vaccines safe, reality long term data this. Short term data shows whole lot side effects shortly vaccination, similar even inferior immunity natural immunity. That’s know now, last time checked (could’ve changed now). never ear aches though Interesting. source this? facilities running expected hell going on? Could AZ incompetent think production facilities currently working maximum efficiency would produced 300 million doses rather 60 odd seem actually possible. think would like that.

If EU capabilities ""fill&amp;finish"" vaccines, probably yes. EU would send letter White House xD. would insane block exports components EU can't nothing them.

On hand, reschedule ""fill&amp;finish"" plants EU, probable would block exports fully manufacture vaccines domestically. feeling slightly sick excuse get vaccine?

That's top 7k vaccines we've given vaccinate healthcare staff. mean difference 30 54%? Yup, seems high.

The 94% basically unattainable goal study second-generation transmission open environment. reach 94% effectiveness, 100% efficacy 94% infections coming partner; 94% efficacy 100% infections coming partner, values two upper lower limits. antibody treatments available ? damn astra zeneca failure last year beginning thought savior Yeah, EU could act like US stop exports, would help EU. also might happen companies fail deliver promised.

But best world. every nation starts export bans, hamper trade seriously reduce global manufacturing capacity - less vaccines everyone. nations stop exports rest keep them, stopping exports gain. best global solution would everybody allowed exports, maximizes total amount vaccines produced.

Prisoner's dilemma. Originally Oxford envisioned vaccine open sourced. (reportedly) Bill Melinda Gates Foundation pressured give exclusivity reputable pharmaceutic company (AZ ended winning) avoid vaccine botched uncontrolled manufacturing. may exceptions sure approved AZ. support vaccination effort, family members yet trust vaccine time.


If reach ""herd immunity"" numbers, see would problem. definitely people take vaccine actual health reasons. broad discrimination helped.

No. Listen vaccine manufacturers. morons Reddit. deliver enough 25m people. we're lucky AZ manages reach reduced Q1 target 30m doses. However, 2 doses needed that's 15m people.

The EU population ~450m. never claimed hoarding anything. that's lovely pharmacy work already insulted sorts names book vaccine let alone actually start. Also hearing horror stories double bookings literally corporate wanting done every 15 minutes top usual duties. really working forward shitstorm isnt prescription ready. Eligibility useful Availability. I'm already eligible, can't get appointment. mean ever enforced...even remotely. wanted travel could. week one, remember exponential. go zero immunity 90% six weeks. linear growth would 15% right exponential stacked towards end Vaccines held anticipation approval use near future. It’s rare good planning US government something shame for. personally never gave april. willing travel hours distant pharmacy necessary. one benefits job time stuff like this.

it's really good specific fallback date eligibility work out, though. state pretty unclear goals general eligibility, understand since want delay people mad, personally understand concept tentative date. funny Iowa lifted restrictions weeks ago one freaking here.

I give shit someone wants wear mask post covid flu, go want judge anyone does.....don't ask though. signed masking covid, after. time vaccine approved children, supply won’t issue. hope there’s digital option proof vaccination, I’m concerned members household try steal vaccine card, got print copy. Judging fact halting vaccine people get average number blood clots, would seem government sucks math. “Hey, air mine! **AAH—**” Damn wait driving way Houston second dose? Change phone time zone San Juan PR look walmart website 10pm tonight, think you’ll find success conservative. timeline doesn’t seem fit given vaccination rates dates significance. 25m 245lbs: doses Moderna. Sore arm side effect. going investigate control group deaths too? caused disease lockdowns. People stress, maybe lost employment, cut social support network. course substance abuse going increase. 12-step programs recovery groups meeting remotely, isn’t in-person meeting. People pressure abuse substances fewer resources quit. First. one told anything first shot. Received paperwork except vaccine proof card. Desperately trying get mom signed Maryland. posted new mass vaccination site appointments last night claimed 5 minutes site crashed. God, hate news articles use hyperlinks. click ""study"" takes articles tag ""study."" 

Anyway, study looks family members healthcare workers. They're 30% less likely get sick compared household workers vaccinated. vaccinated workers fully vaccinated received one dose either Pfizer AZ.

So shows vaccines reduce transmission, really quantifying extent reduce transmission directly since population still get sick contacts may outside home. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

None plants reported issues, despite AZ shifting blame. fully pre pandemic normal think means schools opening absolutely zero restrictions means kids vaccinated be. think fall fair that. adults, summer sure hope I’m wrong, I’m optimistic. New York City opened vaccinations people 60+, state vaccination sites ( Javits Center, Aqueduct) booked entire month May. lots sites distributed around city, handle relatively small numbers.

I surprised bribery discovered future investigations whole debacle. know, 50 million three months honestly big commitment, even AZ. like 15 million month. think manage, bit they're now. Palestinians doing? pharmacy/grocery stores give away vaccines due shows. Thats got mine young risk person. Rhey either going throw away give volunteer people show appointment. would go local one hour close check Lol ok vaccine free USA?  Hot girl summer Patients respond well chiropractic management. study deserved now. dont need add controversial vaccine stockpile... would counterproductive dont see difference two approaches. Biden saying thing diplomatic way.

Even Trump US vaccination program going way, way better European one. really bad look EU systems impeded Trump US Johnson UK still vastly outperforming you.

Thats feels EU least. Yeah maybe Can't blame TBH considering AZ's recently developed reputation unreliable comes vaccine deliveries mRNA tech badass I’m dreading going back person lol Dude mask portrait it? 

That pathetically transparent narcissist shit right Beer taps Can't give million vaccinations day murder 500,000 people first, right? 🖕 Another step towsrd third workd Europe ✅ Yup Yummy vaccines point maybe better European countries simply see AZ doses bonus stops planning actually receive vaccines. Norway complained receive information delivery cancelations hours deliveries, something going awfully wrong planning. That's do. Feel sneeze, step away others, lower mask, use elbow. imagine fear losing one's job health insurance pretty big disincentive trying baby. Keep mind usually stated much lower confidence since placebo group usually little severe cases deaths either. Israeli extremely wide studies Pfizer show efficacy preventing asymptomatic, severe deaths very, close percentage. line thinking I’ve pushing made headway people fence. last generation asked make serious sacrifices country Nam. Since we’ve lived (many Americans, all) super comfortably without making real sacrifices greater good. 

Getting vaccine ending pandemic, healthy individuals get must, it’s duty help protect fellow Americans.  thankful weren’t drafted prorate country. thankful you’re going work factory produce war machines war doesn’t find way here. 

All get shot. civic duty. Stop waiting sidelines letting everyone else personal guinea pig.  don’t get sit everyone else takes one protect you. Yes, great news. Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax AZ it. no, want avoid pan possible. Lol, got downvoted hell stating article says. Read it. 🖕🖕🖕🖕 Oh serious? 

I thought vitriolic shit takes College high school? include AstraZeneca, check monthly delivery numbers.

Can link official plan? Anyways, even does, AZ gonna deliver least doses surely? hope 50 million whole EU Q2 commitment manage fulfill... regulator also concluded there's evidence linked vaccine instances clotting line expect statistically group. 

Seriously, what's fucking angle here? Seems classic case willful failure see wood trees. 25m vaccinated UK case rates deaths plummeting. Surely that's headline news here? did, take away them. also credit saving many lives pulling UK deep crisis experienced around new year. big image problem, though, establishing unreliable. seems many times cut deliveries blue, people hard time finding why. wish could figure precisely production capacities are, inform everyone expected delays causes that, continue new plan fulfill. way would made news once, establish pattern AZ reducing deliveries every two weeks. rates increasing every week host new vaccines expected summer. Possibly. I’m optimistic, we’ve got lot people taken vaccine already - vaccinations increasing accelerating pace FYI:

EU vaccine production would halve night UK exporting anything. Lul Canadian healthcare tho plan accounting Biontech, Moderna J&amp;J? sounds pretty good, somewhat similar latest estimates Finland. Australia life pretty much back normal barring restrictions. 

Trust me, everyone go nuts try make lost time always 100 million 100 days. groups pushing 200 million Biden said basically first day office. 30 million already vaccine doses. That’s official, confirmed Covid case count. 

Another 60 million least one dose / first dose. 

With 90 million people level vaccination, quickly approaching third country vaccinated. Orgefest best fest blocked export Australia, likely follow. Unless decide abandon AZ completely. voices - mostly due misinformation (the latest blood clots, media coverage criminal fearmongering) also due legitimate concerns performance SA strain. include AstraZeneca, check monthly delivery numbers. EU countries wait 4-5 weeks vaccinate everyone. September completion vaccination program seems likely, hopefully risk groups still vaccinated late spring. said EU limiting AZ vaccine exports. however made sound though EU also limited Biontech exports

Again mistaken.

This first comment entirety deleted mods knows EU cracking exports though. They’ve passed laws stop export EU quotas met first. Italy used stop recent shipment Australia.

You followed starting reply false

So admit it’s false. EU cracking vaccine exports like originally said. 

Further, legislation cracks exports, includes vaccines, includes Pfizer. may *currently* restricting Pfizer vaccine exports, manufacturing issue production drops EU quotas. will.

It’s ever said fact. None points arguable. F far think UK managed export worse version Covid stay inside forever would like. rest us gonna go back normal made vaccines joe world's total 350m Vaccinations far

Vaccine distribution slow states I've seen, absolutely politicized ways grotesque.

I feel like people celebrating early.  

So many people died needlessly nation's sloppiness asshole behavior. remember felt like late calling pandemic like month Using words “likely” “probably” doesn’t sound like statement fact. us don’t live rural states.

Makes sense! Indestructible... hear Smithers... indestructible *doesn't* appear way, there's evidence deaths simply coincidental. guess could maybe justify suspending individual batch, vaccine itself?

Thankful US killing vaccines chances able see later year. lost dad grandma, gained lot weight, depressed, unemployed hey least graduated honors. life dumpster, hindsight 2019 peak year. latest batch AZ seem weird.

Sweden reports several cases blood clots AZ vaccination. Several countries also reported cases blood clots latest AZ batch.

The fact many countries stopped specific batch investigation fact many cases blood clots arised batch seen batches vaccine tells something specific batch need investigate it. ridiculous. They've screwed rollout six ways sunday. Glad see hard data trickling in. amount FUD sent whether vaccine respiratory virus decreases transmission incredibly frustrating.

Call prediction goal whatever want, people think sort statement future happen exactly like told seen lie insane. People weird expectation perfection one ever attains it. like Republicans crowing ""Fauci wrong"" (and often add ""a lot"" false). Yeah, recommendations hell lot better random bullshit appeases masses. whole thing exposed science way like seem think instead exposed sheer ignorance lack critical thinking exists society.

My note: 
Northeast governors also buy 39 million doses directly Russian fund give vaccines national immunization program.

This. time ever get sick folks come work ill. can't totally blame though, families support little sick leave. question!! husband fully vaccinated +2 weeks April 28th. laws vaccinated also, obviously three kids wont (we stay home online school).

My laws travel jobs go bars indoor dining, etc. safe much, okay see us adults vaccinated? It’s near close over. I’m thinking Christmas later form normalcy. show ID buy certain items. I've worked 5 different jobs last year. Nobody wears mask outside sales floor. worked office job. Nobody wore mask. believe polls like this. know one person still trying social distance. Unfortunately people outside service, *work* essential them, *workers* not. job requires us get flu shot every year, Covid vaccine ""optional""... why? Maybe US, rest world. Nope, I'm wearing mask sniffles. I'm actually sick, I'll stay home. hand make additional effort exercise don’t bike ride / work every day. Yeah, I'm trying bash field anything, they're definitely pretty vital part healthcare. I've met good people, I'm saying they're stupid people. whatever reason, far science goes, seems like often believe crazy shit. think people travel air often enough notice ""a day"" happens.   agree principle, I’m speaking practical aspects getting bodies (whatever body’s beliefs) vaccinated. 

Selfish people respond selfish incentives: what’s me? Oh, $100? Movie tickets? paid day off?

None personal friends family need incentive like that. know shitty people well might respond incentive like that. organization wants us return office even though almost whole staff not/won’t vaccinated time. implied it’s fairness depts public contact roles, support local businesses impact budget, though distant indirect. plan immediate they’ll much retooling space make safe us there, especially eating lunch windows open outdoor common areas sit. Many staff use public transit spotty reputation mask enforcement crowding well. understand wfh wasn’t going forever, I’m resigned going back I’m vaccinated, year successfully working home, endanger us now? Exactly. people care consequences choice body?

Edit: grammer Commuting immeasurable impact quality life. I’d never consider job half hour away house ever again. 

This something rest world figured out. America commute way longer anyone else. Probably lack affordable housing urban centers. booster shots needed? vaccines effectiveness wear off, many new variants.   

If Americans gets vaccinated one time, COVID come back strongly, likely form new variants. COVID still massively active globally, protection vaccine worn off, serious trouble unless people get additional vaccination.  

Having people US get vaccinated way mean COVID gone. vaccinate one time US, would get massive numbers people getting infected dying effectiveness vaccines wear off. Well don’t get numbers right starters feel risk, then.

The thing remember human beings that, them, moral stances entirely situational. Change situation old principles longer apply. don’t go outside you’ve vaccinated then... one stopping staying inside longer   Exactly. 6 month old won’t vaccinated COVID months years. It’s choice vaccinated, also pose risk son. mother law refused vaccine got would force work office home. even mean, who's saying stuff? I’m ok result choices. got vaccinated protect myself. vaccinated vaccine works, care I'm vaccinated? worried vaccinated? Haha March 15th moved whole new state job. got told I’m wfh permanently. got told live said state continue working even though remote. It’s great. I've read it- twice- find mention ""raw mRNA"" floating around context.

“Non native LNPs studied tested decade now. know causes toxicity current research aware shows evidence LNP toxicity current particles again- actual reference please post could post dozens articles talking lack toxicity.

They’ve tested decade rhey kept toxic.

I change tune right here, right zero qualms whatsoever actually this. Show dozens studies showing lack toxicity LNPs used vaccines. Actually even one two would suffice. I’m genuine. haven’t seen research would love see it. Evidence LNPs they’re using toxic accumulate would greatly appreciated. articles always crack insert specific state, like Coloradans separate species rest us. made vaccine:

In lab, Novavax made special virus infects special moth cells dish. Yes, cells like moth caterpillar. instead making viruses, infected cells make spike part outside Coronavirus whole bunch times. cell made bunch spikes, get blown shredded spikes join together make little spiky balls like toy Jacks. chunks outside Coronavirus. chunks separated stuff dish mixed special soapy plant extract preservatives keep fresh safe. put vials go place get vaccine shot. 

This done MERS HPV vaccines, totally new process. Stay home Sure! answer one. 6 months trial starts. 6 months median follow up. Meaning, first dose Phase 3 trial went arm 2010, wouldn’t count “started” - FDA wants see median dose received least 6 months prior.

Exactly. 6 month mark actually I’m following. Time people interchangeable. trial 2,000 people waits 6 months, would catch common latent side effects rare immediate ones say, incidence 1 10,000. hand trial 1,000,000 participants 1 day follow would catch rare immediate side effects, common delayed ones.

My point number people study increases- likelihood someone going sensitive rare reaction goes significantly. We're 5 months 6 month study _millions upon millions_ people vaccinated. likelihood going reaction- even one normally takes long time- someone still would now.

And again- evidence vaccines causing long delayed side-effects would love read I'm aware don’t think FDA would refuse fully approve vaccine formality only. You’re free think otherwise.

I reasons already stated. would come reason ignoring rules would fuel nutters. worth instead waiting month. course. I’m going shame anyone doesn’t, I’ll masking future feel need grocery shop/go pharmacy/whatever actively ill. finished filled US according many sources. Idk jabbing needle muscle would make hurt. Maybe?   stay home sick actually back giving people paid sick leave so. I'm sure patents filed EU. X-ray tech even think requires real degree medical training go get UEI, people limited education sure huge, huge number people vaccinated one place, automatically recorded vote next election /s use term know else call it.

Throwing away privacy disease almost certainly going kill **me** something fan of. KW13? child can’t vaccine yet. kids can, go public vulnerable. Yes, kids get severely ill less often adults do. lots parents, risk worth reward. close family vaccinated take kids see spend time together indoors. 

But wouldn’t go stadium yet I’m afraid son. Now, told adults vaccinated get stadium see concert/baseball game whatever? That’s game changer. I’d seriously consider that. 

Also remember people CAN’T vaccinated various medical issues. people deserve able resume normal life. get vaccination. I’d rather see federally mandated sick leave program since individual employers don’t care enough include sick leave part benefits know never actually happen. sure someone can’t miss work they’re sick, wearing mask would considerate gesture. It’s extra precaution taken normal circumstances timely approval necessary isn’t hundreds thousands people dying millions hospitalized.

This point EUA - allow non approved therapy vaccine it’s emergency travel 4 8 hours round trip sales... need fired immediately blacklisted healthcare permanently. objection moot time employers could generally require vaccine widely available months. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

What’s deal that? guys like anti someone nice someone they’ve called idiot information sourced cdc Who? seems like you’re trying cause division @kimmey12 instead supporting ability people respectful nuanced conversations difficult topics people may disagree? trying that? Ok what’s hardest COVID restriction USA? would take vaccine today. can’t get one yet though.

But yes would change tune making mandatory it’s FDA approved Amen 🙌 It’s pretty hypocritical say don’t agree forcing people take vaccine also ok results.

You right want take vaccine. right inflict presence people don’t want exposed virus. agree people get get. There’s still lot caveats saying J&amp;J effectiveness par MRNA vaccines there. Early indications least Pfizer Moderna comparably effective variants coming original strain. 

Additionally, works faster relative. Data showing MRNA vaccines efficacy rates higher J&amp;J first dose. need make sure get second dose make “stick”.

Everything else, agree, end day take away get whatever available first. America called preexisting condition Symbolic flipping bird governments told us to.

Now large part population vaccinated, infection rates go quickly. need bigger bigger cohorts number infected person reflects anything (both volunteers control group).

Just second shot yesterday spent hours going melting freezing bed rather sleeping bad headache joint pain. considered mild side effects.

But live, stories gotten around (true ones I've verified myself) people much stronger reactions. One person requiring oxygen hospital, another workaholic stayed home 2 days (she 2 jobs miss both), lot cases people basically getting symptoms honest, would worse actual Covid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, obese older, likely would fare much worse, lot younger people asymptomatic light symptoms couple days. feel like media, sub, companies, governments, really underplayed these, especially mrna ones, you.

But I've talked people getting vaccine, honestly, one bad side effects (people say already covid, town so...), feel like total piece shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

We say day people better long term, know that. know lot frankly, even now. People need able make choices, feel comfortable, time people worry vaccination, even higher % jabs helps prevent cases people vaccine evoke response, people can't get reason.

12.3% Fully Vaccinated May months away still find strange Malta able administer many doses. around 24 doses per 100 people, simply impossible distribution even EU countries. Literally 64 million people are, most, two weeks significant protection

Where? Germany we've told expect GP's vaccine **starting** May. point? many Germans confident government election coming. ""I also credit saving many lives pulling UK deep crisis experienced around new year.""

What people seem understand waves always crash themselves, quiet spectacularly. That's call waves.

The big effect vaccines elderly population. number deaths decreased dramatically throughout thanks vaccine. 

Don't surprised third wave. vaccine good, new wave started somewhere whatever reason, can't stop it. two vaccines kill 0 people, one vaccines kills 22 people, sound reasonable stop using it. least investigate properly make sure people know vaccine can, however unlikely, kill you. first say essential workers pregnant, pregnant woman? sure flip flop quite frequently. BBC articles cited thread says million vaccines per batch, death Italy death Austria different batches (we know death Denmark 3rd batch one two).

Essentially, ask much received two stimulus payments add onto return based extra kid. baby July super simple get extra $1100 return. vaccine killing people I'd say much needs discussed. understand it, EU countries able ""opt out"" contracts want vaccine.

For example, Hungary states opted latest Moderna contract say delivery Q3/Q4 would late them.

Maybe EU members states opted (parts of?) earlier contracts well. example, countries doubts cold chain requirements Biontech/Pfizer wanted focus AstraZeneca instead. member states may receive less vaccines e.g. Germany now, Germany wanted focus Biontech/Pfizer. drive :) would like managing uncontrolled forest fire.

I’m booked get AZ vaccine next Friday! bet get pull altogether next day. It’s looking group 50/50 vaccinated unvaccinated people, seeing many people didn’t get sick vaccine. example, Pfizer 95% efficacy, 170 sick people, 8 vaccine 162 placebo. AFAIK bought extra doses mRNA vaccines others want due high cost. However surely doses unwanted distributed evenly across EU countries want them, instead presumably resold highest bidder many vaccinated sadly great see us want get jab. countries wore masks covid  Brits. often EMA, European Commission health authorities individual Member States confused one another. common mistake EMA approves vaccines, Commission based EMA recommendation (as happened yesterday Johnson Johnson vaccine). know much cons I've never one EXACT thought Renaissance Faires. Like, smaller ones go business? performers shopkeepers go another industry either necessity, want instability performing life knowing whole industry shut year help govt stay afloat? 

And town lost favorite small businesses. Even vaccine available everyone tomorrow, Covid vanished entirely, year magicly like 2019. still lost much (not mention, course,all people died!) Anybody know Americans abroad get train? know feeling, gotta preserve sanity 👍🏽 know sure yet, seems suggest shall see ELI5 “efficacy”?

Obviously 50% efficacy doesn’t mean 50/50 chance getting Covid odds weren’t bad start with. Yep.

I've never heard anything this. Can't imagine time wait weeks see people suddenly die. Anyway point blame customer receiving faulty product. blame producer caused it. article found english, supposedly countries like Malta Denmark getting higher percentage doses others like Bulgaria Croatia. According Kurz, due ""secret contracts"" outside agreed member states. CVS Gettysburg, State College, King Prussia, Pennsylvania say they’re available CVS’ website  many people inoculated single batch? 
I’m struggling think batch would differ would cause blood clots. I’m puzzled well. one hand, several people pointed consider general instances clot, AZ vaccine within instances, it’s media story blown proportion. 

But we’re hearing story Pfizer/Moderna/JnJ. not. people still jog ride bikes go ice fishing, ice skating play hockey walk dogs go hikes snowshoe/x-country ski/snowmobile ski snowboard make snowmen igloos winter? Warm clothes layers king. Long underwear warm socks go long way. last year, optimism nice here’s hoping! wait good batch. sincerely, Australia  Something like 70% people 65 gotten vaccine already batch also banned Romania We’ve gotten really good making vaccines, really good studying effects new medicines. LOT testing rolled out. know still don’t understand? long term health implications recovered Covid. 

Not mention, survival rate may high, it’s still killed 3 million people. That’s lot grandparents, siblings, children, parents, loved ones, friends, gone. Without vaccine, potential kill another 3 million next year. mention, variants floating around seem worse original. could become deadly. I’ll risk well studied vaccine versus unknown “will catch new variant kills leaves horrible permanent lasting side effects like chance dying stroke hit 40?” Social media regulated. trying relate astrazeneca vaccine blood clots isnt statistically true. fear people would anti vaxx  We’ll see. worry kids well. don’t like push shove back classrooms. least 18’s tested moment fair developed covid-19 Gross California physically big, vaccines transported whole lot get destination getting state. lower delivered distributed number fully expected. Longer supply lines means vaccines transit. EMA final quality control authorisation batch. specifically - anyone else article get issue is. Besides, Austria might want use existing stockpile AstraZeneca vaccine doses first investigation concluded. people listening they're scared, they're listening things open.


Once vaccinated people seems ready go back normal completely....this long grand scheme social behavior...not long enough forget want doing. understanding Pfizer prevents 97% symptomatic infection 94% non symptomatic infection. statistically sound inference non symptomatic people would take fewer precautions symptomatic people? 

Would cause three percent difference? Well latest plan AZ deliver 90M doses whole EU Q2. would mean little 1M Denmark, Denmark around 1ish% EU's adult population.

Now, Denmark expect vaccinate much 100k day, would mean delay 10 days without AZ doses. delay 20 days means vaccinating 50k people day, equivalent 750k day Germany. sound terribly unrealistic. Hopefully Danish government done better math lol. know faulty? Totally agree. I'm also thinking non-work public places (public transport, stores, etc) masking ill standard practice many culturally ""collectivist"" countries. @ Roy Cooper...chop chop let’s go Gotta love california gives illegal aliens driver's licenses get another ID husband kept away vaccine, concern effective him. medication takes autoimmune disease every six months targets B cells turn slows/prevents body making antibodies.

Israel good relation USA China, get vaccines both. amazes Canada still got enough supply US yet. can’t see past selfishness. them, vaccination something don’t (hint: likely latter) reasons solely related themselves. vulnerable stay home, say. Everyone, vulnerable too, live full lives others took nigh-inconsequential steps make safer, that’s much ask, it’s affront freedom whatever. 
 
Selfishness, selfishness, selfishness. Nothing more. I'm saying mandating Covid vaccine necessary. Sorry pick that. Yearly mRNA injections? can’t safe, it? begins... luckily I’m construction don’t worry about... little anyways  hope one else does

That's one take! imagine non-US countries continue practice, wearing mask sick regular practice lots places, pre-covid. normal, legit forgot right everyone else, weird. Imagine caring much people do. government making wear mask, let people want, literally affect all. could also dont trust vaccine pushed regulatory approval. Lots companies rushed first real time long term effects can't studied later.

Personally, I'm getting unless I'm required get travel see family. I'm much forcibly vaccinated. get sick, that's me. get someone else sick (and vaccine widely available) that's getting vaccinated. ""experts"" lost admitted they'd essentially lied public masks doctors could limited supply.

They'll lie think itll make public ""act correctly"" I'm bad guy wanting truth told instead measured bs political statements. Done COVID mean gone, means longer serious issue. everyone willing able vaccinated (all age groups) get point really like flu, COVID over, even gone. AstraZeneca adenoviral vector vaccine, correct? COVID-19 destroys tissues infect blood distortion tissues result blood clots. However adenovirus used infect cells cells get destroyed live vaccine. I'm worried recently first AZ dose zero issues. vaccinating tens millions people course weird things happen immediately pure coincidence.. European date format Day, Month, Year way Month, Day, Year 


So article published today. much. There's still protection UK variant current vaccines. would booster increase hopefully stay ahead mutations may decrease effectiveness vaccine.

It's also good trial run booster process look like mRNA vaccines. Probably next year (eg flu vaccine)? black guy doesn’t want get vaccinated whatever reason

Lmao black anything, bud ...

My point discussing here, probably numbers even available right now, different countries said might problem vaccines, say researchers making claims ""so dumb""? even low income. know many middle class people don’t get paid sick leave.  matter people mad? doesn’t mean employer can’t make requirement. 

And people sue anything. doesn’t mean win. People surely probably sue employers don’t require it

There’s also obvious difference COVID kill, often long-term consequences, easily spread, contagious people aware they’re infected, readily available, endemic, highly effective vaccine. different disease think top head town, option approved ones. pick site offer AZ one. I'll drive to. 

BTW, age range opened up, yet, get vaccine soon can. Waiting article month talking ""grocery deserts"" LA. Italy civil unrest* new jews Here’s thoughts:
First, offer vaccine *everyone.*

Then, keep requirement covid test quarantine travel. However, you’re vaccinated, you’re exempt covid testing quarantines mask wearing. great goal.
Sounds good, measurable, reasonable, time specific ambitious enough. understand people’s concerns mind set make people comply whole raped economy transferred billions banks corporations. risk take precautions, idea restricting others back fire inevitably expand beyond initially proposed scope. lol imagine paranoid. wife commission next day. Slight fever, super tired. one day though. marathon show take naps good. Generally you’re pretty safe flights due way circulate air plane. don’t think wearing mask you’re scared catching something necessary. 

If happen sick hand, it’s somewhat courteous gesture protect others around you. That’s it’s Asia long time don’t see shouldn’t extend rest world. argument harm caused employers requiring vaccination (stricter employee regulation/less personal choice employees) preferable alternative, see as:

-Keeping businesses require benefit in-person work closed additional amount time (economic harm)
-Opening businesses schools without sufficient vaccination rules place (harm public health)

It sounds like disagree option 2 would cause change case numbers. think would, probably service/leisure businesses schools (data seems indicate far schools rank low culprits community spread).

Opening certain businesses indoor dining statistically linked increases community spread - see study example: mean allowing businesses open cater unvaccinated individuals cause degree problems past? Maybe based data cited declining cases. know net effect - vaccines helping overall case numbers. possible employer mandates could help reduce case numbers even more, given data studies one above.

So actual harm option 2 net increase cases/fatalities. someone manages health personal decision.

It sure 100% legal justified businesses ban employees customers get vaccinated. would decision want frequent business institutions forbade obese people entering stores?

As far know would legal, bit weird valid claim could bad influence others promoting obese behavior.

We know valid claim. really think anyone looks obese person goes ""I wanna like them""? Could explain? one employee could kill people company held liable. immune compromised individuals cannot get vaccine. protect them. WFH option, employees refuse get vaccine work home endanger lives others. We’re people got Peloton pandemic I’ve ride days lunchtime. haven’t healthy since college I’ve dreading losing option. desire work first thing morning 6 PM hour train/bus basically zero.

Don’t trust speed “cure “ I’ve seen many recommendations changed trust anything that’s said. world gone completely deep end something killed less 1% population, looks like control measure anything else Phase 3 clinical data yet formally published... it’s gone private peer-review. assume may become less effective time (most vaccines do), would *very* surprised anywhere close ineffective 1.5 years, especially given current ones good.

Bear mind also SARS-CoV-2 never going spreading among totally immunonaïve population again, know spreads done mitigate it, test rapidly.

The (very unlikely) worst case scenario perfect vaccine escape variant comes nowhere, even happens we'll knowledge testing contact trace, now-established platforms rapidly roll new vaccines. Yep. first year entire 5 years child’s life haven’t flus colds entirety flu season. I’m definitely convinced continue wear masks. Wow. would thought rushed vaccine little testing would serious side effects. Action fine, mandate anyone take something would restrict people taken actions. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

EU actually something rolling over? British government stepped Merek wanted manufacture US worried US would place export ban vaccines. did. Friendship ended Pfizer, Novavax new best friend point time, US go Trump stick. country cannot trusted anymore. vaccine rollout pathetic. Makes Canada look good comparison. IIRC they're finishing upgrades Pfizer factory Belgium, hence slow supply far; that's complete coming days supply increase. Shipments Moderna due start arriving soon too, Novavax (which set new factory UK) likely receive approval soon. know local GP site 2,000 week based supply said could 14,000 week enough supply. 100% effective preventing hospitalization death, is, know, main reason whole world gave shit COVID first place.

AZ met targets all. PR disaster. trials questionable. arbitrarily stop delivering inform client days ahead send fewer doses promised days before. 

This company absolutely incapable large scale operation. Omg exactly this. I’ve thinking many people I’ve lost respect interest honestly ever seeing talking again. lot people, lot emotionally. UK Astra lied since start. Fool British facilities going great, exactly UK reliant supply India bigger Astra doses given fucking shit. went working 5/6 times week running week. want scream fucking abyss. 

And tell work home even remotely close.  Pakistanis afraid 'DNA harvested' - honestly average American cares lot privacy average Pakistani - probably even know DNA is. yep,a nurse died Austria receiving AZ vaccine. know one doctor also got said side effects 3 straight days. Hey conservatives...this means gonna steal guns. Severe adverse reaction actually includes death    sure tbh. Even bigger companies purpose built campus style office space said still expect need 60-80% space minimum. Hell company ever desks 80% staff pre pandemic cost saving measure.

The outlook offices sure different exactly yet unclear. mean sincerity world. hope catch COVID, able enjoy spring break! vaccine give syndrome 8k mid-january. cases tanking since 80% people ended hospital fat. Average covid death average life expectancy. 0.01% deaths people age 50. stay locked like zoo animals 86 year old watch TV two years? sneeze mask remove use arm? I’ve sneezed mask couple times mask covered snot isn’t really pleasant experience. Germany's delivery schedule based 31m doses. far received 3.06 scheduled receive another 2.54m four installments end March/beginning April (KW13). means supplied roughly 17m doses EU far. remaining 14m two weeks seem pretty unlikely although doable, we're talking AZ here! I'd rather wait Europe join vaccine nationalism game. Aw found another one 😢 Found another one part deal getting vaccines. Also, biggerst % population vaccinated, everyone vaccine - it’s easiest kind journal this? There's beef, Italian private company produce Sputink V, neither EU Italian gov give fuk.  Reminds Japan way honest. Interesting Japan also high number anti-vaxxers well still spreading like crazy europe? also haemorrhaging money even pandemic though. Given entire business model month-to-month leases commitment, find hard believe they’re well. made one edit post lol. elaborate little further, Financial Times looked data couple weeks ago calculated adults receive first dose 21 June second dose end July. also found over-30s would start receiving doses May, either means expected supply increased even since means Metro says 'by April' mean 'by end April'. Either way, still brilliant Spoiler: sub never really rational. There’s always outlier idiots. won’t policy. Trust me, 3 months thing over. restrictions July 4th weekend. 

There seems hard-on goal post moving sub now. situation fluid. What’s happened discovered 3 highly effective vaccines could manufacture rapidly. waiting relatively short amount time (another 3 months), get pretty much everybody vaccinated wants save bunch people’s lives. 

As though experiment, consider world everybody 65+ vaccinated nobody 65 was. let’s say could vaccinate 65 tomorrow they’d instantly full immunity. Would support wearing masks keeping capacities limited today give people 65 chance get vaccine? probably would. let’s say going take 5 years vaccinate 65. Would feel way? Probably not. isn’t flattening curve anymore. whether 3 months reasonable timeframe keep restrictions place (they’ll get less less throughout period) order get 100+ million people vaccinated save 20,000 lives maybe. think it’s decent trade though everybody may agree.  nasty little astrazeneca  Sweet Mass mass vaccinations? 

Like.... Vaccinations church? Canada 589 deaths per million. South Korea 32 deaths per million. Vietnam road Wuhan, yet 0.4 deaths per million. Koreans Vietnamese smug despite success.

There anti-mask rallies across Canada: blame foreigners USA's anti-mask rallies USA's poor COVID numbers. That's us. see blaming foreigners Canada's anti-mask rallies poor COVID numbers. That's you. That's politicians really coming behind.


Bravo. delusional mate need get back “normal” causing alarming increase zoonotic diseases slowly killing species dammit! Yes, important note something happens someone got vaccine absolutely normal slow rollout enough time check could linked.

In normal situation may even made news standard protocol. anything fact spot things good, shows big undetected problem we'd spot also.

People need chill let regulatory bodies job. (and journos), vaccine supply improved significantly yesterday big numbers expected 15 March onwards. literally likely get hit car suffer severe adverse effects virus. go ahead, eager give vaccine hasn’t even tested age group yet. think closer 13 million still deliver reach 30, agree. add insult injury, UK getting 10 million extra doses India get nothing. work massive companies moving working home office hybrid going attractive companies paying run big office. ‘rough’ consist of? second shot Saturday filled dread I’ve heard far. Still better Covid, looking forward it. Thats good! low yield biological process huge variance plausible reason? something happen absolutely anywhere company - there's expected yield, range possible yields either side. precisely contracts signed way were, also why, I'll repeat, *more time best way mitigate frequent manufacturing issues*. 

You argue sorts points best. None matters - possibility risk always every firm. Every company going experience problems mitigating bad governance EU. AZ (and pfizer) acutely aware possible supply problems wanted contracts protected company unacceptable financial risk. may content expect high standard officials, not. Severe adverse reaction = “I sick day”

Severe reaction covid = “I need oxygen”

Idiot. Doubt it'll happen time frame Hmmmm hmmm First time indoor dining allowed LA County since July. “We’re working closely nations, get vaccines nations; we’re working world,” Trump said.

Right article. Thanks proving point. surprised see orange yellow tier thresholds changing soon well coincide vaccine rollout. never said don’t work hard jobs, said jobs don’t really require higher scientific level thinking.

There’s absolutely nothing wrong that. Personally, think it’s terrible job requires particular type person would want type work every day. certainly wouldn’t want to, commend like it.

But becomes problem try convince others vaccine opinions hold much weight immunologists “work medical field.” realize Texas doesn’t represent entire US, right?

Also, Europe isn’t country morons look fact say “why vaccinate nobody gets anymore?” without making quantum leap logic reason nobody gets anymore almost everyone vaccinated.

Tell look many people died TB back 2019 (over million!) imagine many would dead TB vaccine. Johnson Johnson? That's one took :/ going mad learn travel country country avaliable vaccinated people moved PA 2019. made get regular ID first (all docs required) sending ""You're pre-approved!"" Letters times year since. Absolute disaster wondering could criminalize jail conservatives disproportionately, way they've used drug laws terrorize minorities may ticket. Funny; one seemed care restricting folks vaccine.. people care already shopping Whole Foods. Buying groceries two factors: price quality, people order. Right lol. Sick stay home losers like guy trying impose self righteousness others. Stay home want. California met first vaccine equity hurdle, counties opening up. Newsom realizing tiers lofty he's making easier move tiers. CDPH:

After reassessment using new thresholds, 13 counties move less restrictive tier, Purple (widespread) Red (substantial): Amador, Colusa, Contra Costa, Los Angeles, Mendocino, Mono, Orange, Placer, San Benito, San Bernardino, Siskiyou, Sonoma Tuolumne. Twenty-one counties remain Purple (widespread) Tier, 33 Red (substantial) Tier, three remain Orange (moderate) Tier one remains Yellow (minimal) Tier. changes take effect Sunday, March 14.

On Tuesday, also expect Sacramento, San Diego 11 additional counties (Kings, Lake, Monterey, Riverside, San Joaquin, Santa Barbara, Sutter, Tehama, Tulare, Ventura Yuba) shift Purple Red based current data projections. tier adjustments assigned Tuesday take effect Wednesday. potential additional counties move tiers next week based next week’s Blueprint tier assessment assignment. Going forward, Purple Tier threshold greater 10 cases per 100,000 people. There's even announced metric green tier goes effect activities allowed. getting way ahead based single quote. I’ve provided source two days ago. Believe want. You’ve provided nothing.  stuff reddit neckbeards like say that, many people trusting government corporations allow thinking them. So, 623 people said unvaccinated people shouldn’t able travel ~553 people said unvaccinated people shouldn’t work public places. Check [the Bloomberg vaccine 19.9% population least one dose; 10.5% fully vaccinated.

J&amp;J currently rounding error. hope know like entire industry destroyed people casually say forever.

I'm saying vaccines stop variants come new solution business closures social distancing long term solutions here...how unreasonable? think Biden administration talking states open adults first May.  Where’s acting mad? Wow. happens put trust almighty government. 

This also don’t criticize want something injected bodies new. Question everything. research make judgement. LA County red tier, love see it. reality, pfizer moderna vaccines better preventing Covid symptoms Johnson vaccine? Good luck that. Kroger’s junior lawyer would taken care week. COVID pandemic ends maybe tackle American pandemic mental illness. 

Yea, probably not. Stop avoiding it. really passionate like say like least pretend put money mouth sponsor front line worker. J&amp;J dose counted 2nd dose fully vaccinated number trackers I’ve seen, since it’s one shot now. seems crucial fact people like ignore...  Wearing mask used conspiracy theory too.  Lol little vaxxers lining 3 4 shots year boosters hahah exactly second saw like nice try media. Sounds like somebody needs work bathroom. MN problem, think one main ones either suing resisting completely govt like happening matter  live Dallas suburbs. tell 'mask-mandate' mean thing - except could potentially get hit fine. never enforced law. Day 1 US acknowledging pandemic here, businesses, still is. pro-mask, also fine wearing one vaccinations. Trump, system enabled was, unfortunately, bolstered conservative government. so? 25 year olds chance 

It's still gonna take awhile, though. like they'll get shot, once, first day available. first week. probably first month. Even ones want it.

You're right we're gonna shutting things that, though. Thank work! literally savings lives. number gives little information number people vaccinated. Especially J&amp;J rolling out, what, 80ish million people vaccinated? ~60% fully? would make sense Christmas, Indiana looks like still suffered big surge November Jan compared Summer/Fall. Yeah CRNA longest one incredibly hard get into. seriousness, [I think would've done great clearly haven’t take care active small child sick dog. “Having flu week” looks different then. adults general pop?

Absolutely not. wear mask face shield. medical reason person can't wear face shield. harmful shirt service leading premature judgment unwarranted premature judgment? Probably, least cases. business would ideally allow people infected Covid. exclude people vaccinated, still excluding people pose danger infected. reasonably considered premature judgment (without full consideration facts Covid tests, isolation, etc...) arrives conclusion based entirely vaccination status.


Not all. mountain evidence suggests could covid still test negative first three days. could also infected negative test. two ways prevent transmission following health protocols getting vaccine. Simply put, business making judgement whether infected. certainly preconceived notion, completely fails consider relevant factors, think could qualify based “reason actual experience.” could certainly qualify.

It not. made determination someone wearing mask without looking see were, would preconceived notion. long look first, not. looking seeing wearing mask ""actual experience"". Furthermore, almost scientists health care industry agree science behind masks certainly based reason refuse vaccine, refused entry places. selfishness utter ignorance cause pandemic even prolonged, kill people?

The vaccine killed anyone, virus killed MILLIONS.

At least try think others once. experts kiss vaccinated ass flight california vacation next month. decide lying ? Dr.Fauci videos deleted lied public ? ( masks , herd immunity , etc. ) Meanwhile Brazil: full speed ahead (the pandemic course)!

Hell no. Give week stomach pain, chills body aches forever media hysteria misinformation really number people's head

No variant appear magically make vaccine useless. Vaccines totally efective agaisnt every single variant there. literal THOUSANDS it. Big business developed vaccine first place, trying view world little conspiracy theory centric bubble accept aren’t important enough “monitor”. Nah, Benjamin Harrison fantastic job handling COVID-19 pandemic Agreed business used people meat shields keep making money get socialist bail protect profits? basically plot South Park vaccination special defective individuals really everyone else’s concern? think not. quite... green tier still means California's health mandates effect loosening restrictions. Given big &amp; sprawling &amp; diverse Golden State is, probable counties various tiers different times. Adding ""green"" tier allows rural regions reopen indoor activities safest extent possible, given they're still connected socially &amp; economically neighboring counties virus may still active. question probably asking whether zones allowed drop mandates even still counties (particularly SoCal) laggard, like may still orange yellow. probably investigated see evidence vaccines accelerating herd immunity. data Israel prescriptive.  really shocks many people willing eager get vaccine. also quick want force everyone else. 

We know vaccine companies vaccine prevent transmission, reduce symptoms 50%. 

It first MRNA “vaccine” mass produced. MRNA vaccines around 20 years, none made past animal testing. 

These “vaccines” rushed development year skipped animal testing.

Also virus 99.99% survival rate people 75. 

Can someone explain (young healthy) get vaccine instead taking chances virus? read article, quotes make pretty clear original comment proof case? infection vaccine dont provide immunity. actually take time read posted? I’m sorry posted doesnt fit narrative, saying spreading misinformation ridiculous statement. much hopeful pandemic end soon, starting become evident wont case. Can't speak Americans strongly disagree. experimental vaccine still requires masking definitely choice able make. Canada, current plan, age group (25-30) getting first vaccine till September :( 34 minute delay fetching comments.

The EMA can't approve anything submitted approval first. 

AstraZeneca/Oxford submitted application conditional authorization 12 January 2021 EMA granted approval 17 days, based submitted documents rolling review. par vaccines.

For comparison, submitted data UK Government 23 December granted approval 30 December.

And even 3 weeks mattered - although really – hard blame EU fact AZ submitted paperwork 3 weeks expect proportionate actions retaliation AZ UK. 

What UK AZ UK taking advantage cost EU lifes.

The UK taking advantage anything AstraZeneca pretty much laughingstock right now, taking advantage anything either – fact, depending happens next, might run risk sued contract performance – going pretty. Fair enough. He’s one small group spam nothing bad news. lol agreed. wasn’t focused yeah FaceTime whatever felt forced boring first time novelty.  Mr hoax miraculously bgonaway? Mr got vaccine secret telling base believe danger virus? guy? excuse white americans uneducated Oh totally agree substitute. guess don’t know anyone complete lockdown whole time. Everyone met occasionally outside socially distanced. led wondering socialization means different things different people.  careful. ""Eligible"" still mean enough supply time. part concerns me. higher risk normal enough tier 1. spent better part year inside people go crazy. adults eligible could problem people like us open floodgates bookings. Now, that's necessarily bad thing fewer restrictions vaccines mean less bureaucracy help enough vaccinations sites available. could end waiting July August get shot means another 3-4 months stuck inside. ‘direct’ it? bs. wrong. U.K. vaccinating quite evenly among two vaccines, beginning Pfizer. bulk EU export Pfizer.  true. 
120.000 deaths, worst death toll capita world (IIRC? Europe), highest infection rates world, coupled best healthcare system network world fact island total control borders means massive, corrupt incompetence could fucked up. 
And.. guess what? Yes knew overall essential workers, recently, safely concern vaccination pregnant women. we've gotten enough vaccine 80+ age bracket, promised deliveries cut half cancelled every day. producing 4 million extra EU next two weeks countries pay addition original two contracts. Pfizer short surely EU would push 4 million used, thus obviously delivering according schedule actually contractually obliged There's saying immunology intuition goes die. makes sense often turn case.

For whatever reason, immune response vaccination much higher actual infection, like ten times antibodies vaccination.

Calling FaceTime much reminder you’re missing substitute. cutesy “Zoom happy hours” crap lost novelty 3 days. weird people know gotten vaccine(it's lot I'm healthcare field), couple bad side effects. One sister, kind symptoms describe. believe covid really early, Italy Nov 2019.  someone lots allergies. Lmaoo well based comments posts I'd stick initial comment. 

And please, I've lived whole life. know feel like spending time cold not, time I'd say want to. mean never leave house months time. I'm outside dog multiple times day, every day. 

Again, WHOLE point people like cold, people mind it. make people feel bad choose winter either way. side effects. severe end non allergic reactions. Got Pfizer vaccine. super tired first dose day flu-like symptoms controllable Naproxen sleep. 

Would year every year meant avoid pneumonia, hospitalized multiple times past horrible. I'm gonna fucking headbang metal concert (whichever fucking one) neck fucking breaks. mRNA change anything body. Imagine cells computers executing programs. DNA like operating system like Windows. Injecting mRNA like installing tiny program computer like Solitaire. run program while, mRNA breaks body hours.

Think way. Hundreds millions people vaccinated mRNA already. parents heard couple random adverse events facebook, even they're true, they're not, getting vaccine still much much better risking Covid. So, EU countries come even close that? Isn’t shared evenly? Denmark buy somewhere else? Serious question: unemployed Covid worse years, income tax waived? mean unemployment paying enough general least pay year easier pass? Heck yes. got second shot ready start going lot less stress. feel guilty everytime leave house right able calm seeing people family amazing . Tbh wanting go bars stuff soon know wait people vaccinated cases go more. Excellent news, convince hillbilly scientists work wont kill all. unlikely.

The EU exported 8 million doses UK, since UK predominantly using AZ, infer lot exported vaccines AZ.

VDL Commission failed us. love finally break character admit never cared killing people first place. Wait. would make eligible adults virus deadly 65+ PA [1% behind US fully vaccinated roughly Neck neck 1st certainly stricter gets states though. 4 friends high risk categories trying since available get it. One fully vaccinated, 1 second dose soon, 2 haven’t able get appointment. I’ll celebrating end trump covid 19 one summer causation confirmed ( = died *because* vaccine) feel reassured anyway, even knowing super low chance. study medicine anything people correct I'm wrong, vaccines supposed make anyone die, they? take look British coronavirus sub see absurd takes people have. I've seen people genuinely believe decisions made Danish Norwegian (not even EU country) health authorities actually EU plot undermine confidence AZ. They’ll day. Plan accordingly  never believe got money this. Zoom video chats nothing pale imitation togetherness one really, deep down, found sufficient enjoyed. There's reason people tuned Zoom fall winter romanticizing start pandemic. 

If anything, stuff like calls Discord better since pretend - voice chat. Instead propping Zoom sufficient socialization everyone shut-in realized quickly good enough. Risking market shares EU future might Trump harshly worded letter. numbers approx 30 blodcloths total 5 mill vaccinated higher would see normal population. carte blanche go ahead, use logic present, ignoring reports deaths severe complications. 

Yes carte blanche. means vaccine cause incidences safely ignored. Now, people experiencing events normal unvaccinated population, would reason investigate.

That's science works. set task force deal dragons, suspend people visiting caves could dragons, without actual evidence dragons existing.

Otherwise becomes exercise hysteria. tabloid headline tomorrow announcing vaccine makes breath smell bad thing starts again. Governments responsibility citizens protect hysteria much health concern. UK vaccinated people AZ no, issues. mostly batch related people die. Sorry, I'm summer. curious, vaccine Walgreens administer. Got appointments 1st 2nd dose, first Monday seems J&amp;J available yet. illinois. Also stage AZ biggest strength turns weakness. 12 week gaps great trying stretch first doses many people possible would someone get dose AZ July knowing can't get second dose October want maximum protection, compared waiting weeks mRNA J&amp;J fully vaccinated would get second AZ dose. Naa. Israel. cannot lose weight now. couple years ago, dropped 50 pounds steadily. fair, gained half back pandemic cannot drop meaningful weight. blood work, everything normal range according results. doctor didn’t call discuss anything, assumed nothing wrong can’t wait appointment couple months. 

I work home constant cold means don’t get walks much. exercise home try watch eat, human don’t make perfect food choice time. 

Of course could due age would make harder lose weight (35) even without pandemic, can’t seem get pounds even though friends family ask I’ve lost weight. feel disappointed answer “no.” vaccines issues like too? I'm genuinely asking, never heard anything vaccines know sure. Eligibility availability vary greatly. Furthermore, takes two weeks final dose develop effective immunity, even everybody got first dose May 1, two dose vaccines won’t fully vaccinated mid-june. J&amp;J vaccine know less would guess +2 weeks injection. conservatively June. 

That said, I’m expecting huge bear-trap cases caused people refuse get vaccinated glady ignore guidelines, people receive first dose vaccine ignorant ignore guidelines, people fully vaccinated still spread virus ignoring guidelines. Israel exactly poor country. We’re really well here. 
I’m eligible group yet mine week went blood test offered spare! father tested positive yesterday, morning waking fainted. call ambulance. He’s feeling better far. Fucked thing hospital beds within region Poland. 

I hope quick recovery. 

I’m test tomorrow, 100% positive. Maybe it’s better with.  אני יכול לחשוב על אחת. parents got AZ France week fine. grandma got Pfizer though side effect either. Talk cheap; PA going uncork head arse fun experience. _one_ thing Belgium right. might currently ahead, lowered targets comming months Except 100% hospitalization sadly I'll go grain say ensure eligible actually get shot. Right now, Ohio open 50+ only, basically impossible get shot. cant imagine pandemonium trying get shot literally everyone eligible. I'm sure I'll get lots responses I'm making super easy get appointment whatever, man. checked CVS Rite-Aid today, literally say appointments open ENTIRE STATE.  Like, joke. eligible mean damn thing can't actually get appointment. going change? someone eligible actually going able make appointment, without pure dumb luck right site exact right time? 

For anyone doubting difficult right now, check Rite Aid CVS's websites promised $2,000. piece shit Biden lied us.  Besides, Austria might want use existing stockpile AstraZeneca vaccine doses first investigation concluded.

This typical Briton argument. AZ deliveries unreliable countries need second dose hand administer first, otherwise high chance second dose never arrive problem. June 25. think we'll good shape. hope anyway. second order vaccine mean fresh order updated match emerging variants. all! case, timing, protected, that’s all. comment seemed misplaced knowing information. Flip flop? 

Essential workers first ones eligible vaccine regardless whether pregnant not. 

Now we're allowing lot different people eligible vaccine multitude reasons, pregnancy counting one reasons (in states). 

The logic woman lower immune system pregnant, fever mother lead fever baby dangerous. Also, mother still antibodies breastfeeding infant also immune response virus, exposed. That's point, initial contracts evenly distributed Eastern European countries take full allocation mRNA sold rights (at cost idk) Denmark/Germany/Malta.

Germany apparently 50/160 million doses extra Moderna order despite 18% population. Obviously kind fucked countries like Austria/Ireland would bought doses probably never heard of/were aware sale (which probably fault still) Indeed feels like misinformation campaign it’s presented media. Concerns absolutely checked pretty much guarantee inevitably find isn’t issue won’t get anything like headlines sound AZ like though... told grow ovaries instead growing balls? Maybe time toughen northerner awfully two ply. cooped 4 walls months time healthy, consider going outside getting fresh air more. lived without seatbelts years, need change anything? That’s opportunistic. 


Ironically, you’d laugh bozo argued 60 years ago, many argue it, you’ll one laughed 60 years now.  Unfortunately won’t around face consequences wrong eyes history. Funny people mocking idiots saying let virus run wild accept small percentage people die. vaccine suddenly lot people think normal accept small percentage people kill. underplaying hand, smart. Keep expectations low look better goes better. stupid, know summer going wild, want say yet set expectation. want bonus. No, appreciate misogynistic remark acting like superior others going outside cold. 2021, stop shit They're lower actually haha Ugh. can't explain you. People age 40 gotten HPV far deserve get vaccine. Oh that's right Im supposed market old age. Insurance want pay it.
The tetanus another way explaining point. Go play rusty junkyard kid. (Granted, tetanus gram + cocci spore live dirt 1000 years.) Viruses sneaky obviously. Viruses mutate warp speed compared basic bacterial infections. Hpv around 60 dangerous strains. 
I wish ppl would realize viruses morph fast trick immune system. comparison Tetanus 1965 VW bug clunks along. Viruses different level quickly evolving things cells. mutate fast weaken host let spread others without killing original host. Bacteria want kill straight up. Thanks spirited debate. Hope come blunt. call things seem them. Hate tippy toeing around elephants room. calling FaceTiming socialization?

Its poor substitute face face interactions. Jeez. Sounds like Mass. we’re booked April. relying Astra Zeneca shipments good thing longterm. We'll see, UK's incidence seems plateau right now. point see smaller smaller waves. exemption Drs signoff. Definitely. Especially Biden announcing adults eligible vaccine May 1, give one month want (two shot dose some), June, masks left ""orgy"". hospital full morons. Please let us know hospital save future lives. Rack em Vaccine shots mandated. They're free all. get shot scheduled, get charged criminal negligence. worst pandemic 100 years duty defeat virus....not us, other.  I’m glad hear she’s better. achy sore arm first go round exactly 24 hours seems. I’m assuming I’ll feeling like trash time second dose, it’s still better Covid weeks. pandemic fully responsible driving extremely left leaning completely changed views lot people

And isolated long made lonely even though social guy capable making friends JJ said restructuring supply line fill finish Netherlands that's exactly take till mid April Trump ummm... good, say least. him, administration, whatever, good job making sure US would shit ton whatever vaccine(s) panned out. I'm guessing it'll like start pandemic: First saw couple people wearing masks, seemed weird. Then, probably 50-50. Now, people without seem stand out.

It'll that, reverse. don’t really get though objectively ordered vaccines ordered wide variety them. Ordered additional vaccines pfizer / Moderna. Biden good job brokering deal Merck / J&amp;J bolster production there. administration oversaw development ordering vaccines previous one. It’s feature bug. Well kills myth always stated ""Viruses mutate become infectious less lethal"" essential worker worship gotten head. one gives shit everyone US go back work since July. You’re harms way staring halls death you’re 65 years old. Double fucking mask wear eye protection you’re scared. haven’t chance take vaccine point it’s almost risk dying covid. Beacuse you’re staying subject either contributing nothing insults?  Transmission outdoors exceedingly rare. Expecting people wear mask they're sitting park ridiculous. Hopefully you’ll able normalish birthday party go grocery shopping? I’m sure you’re getting at. stated numbers based “study” highly educated still doesn’t automatically make intelligent. might mean you’re hard worker good memorizing shit. It’s good critical thinking problem solving make intelligent person doctor know refuses vaccinate religious fanatic 2.9 million? verge greatness. *this* close wife teacher, crazy list severe allergies many things including medications. told 100% support getting it. 

I would reject forced process. feeling euphora relief. days, seriously walking air. 

Then husband caught Covid brought back quickly harshly. working home 4ever...prove didnt get vaxed dickheads! even used /s tag!  requirement Yeah, think it’s already established different perspectives experiences. It’s able take it. vaccines won’t work may significantly less effective certain people. Eg. Transplant patients people immunosuppressant medications It’s really metric use. People don’t know body fat %. It’s harder calculate easier make error. BMI simple.

Yes, outliers like you, vast majority people covered actually overweight obese. 70% Americans aren’t bodybuilders. Sorting outliers isn’t worth administrative burden. I'm it, public safety. here's question. single quarantine day since covid started. Trumps administration stole ppe ""federal use"" we've still heard nothing get vaccinated. So, then, FUCK even proposing shit like this? fuck humanity?  far I’m aware? getting at? employee could kill people company held liable

I thought outraged GOP trying add protection clauses businesses COVID relief bills?  CDC says needs put vaccination long supposed COVID-19 symptoms wait vaccinated recovered illness met criteria discontinuing isolation; without symptoms also wait meet criteria getting vaccinated. intent. something I'm genuinely concerned/worried about. unfortunate preventable.

Although context, waiving vaccine requirements likely solve measles outbreaks either. wont consider poorer nations get vaccines. I'm independent. Live FL. thing changed able hop plane go traveling home see family. Weekends keys changed, boating, etc... meals out. FEAR CV19, constant. fearful inside places long times strangers anything. first read headline thought there's way numbers correct. around 235M adults united states children eligible receive vaccination yet. would indicate around 42% adults 18 received least first vaccination.

For percentage fully vaccinated adults 13% would mean around 29% adults would first second dose, even including Johnson Johnson single-dose vaccine.

Then open article states 65.9M adults around 28% adults ""have received least one vaccine"" opposed 30M adults already fully vaccinated. wild twice many people waiting second shot people who've already fully vaccinated.

This kind acceleration means US absolutely kicking Covid's ass right now. We're even better realized. Healthcare tho fear-mongering. really surprise, we've seen play Israel January race variant vaccination program.

Many severe cases deaths among younger (30-50) people original variant. Especially bad pregnant women. provided exact data studies efficacy direct links papers scientist. said none provide 100% protection infection. missing? say vaccine stop getting Covid? where.

It’s become super obvious you’re troll I’m done. time figured “vaccine card” we’ll ~~done Covid~~ 2120 pandemic. Well I'd say pandemic, would lionized large swaths corporate media contrast Trump last Spring (eg. Rachel Maddow saying ""it's like two Presidents""). top that, goes writes book handling crisis..during crisis, goes brothers show softballed, accepts Emmy. 

The Pandemic nursing home scandal forced revered backtrack compounded new scandals. COVID least planted seed downfall.

Never even heard nucleocapsid before. book read 2014 Ebola outbreak definitely anticlimactic feel it. fuss social distancing vaccines making sure community spread US, virus burn out. big event, dwindling cases eventually epidemic over.

it’s like Bojack quote “just bc mental illness means get shitty person” it’s doing, sitting hands 3%? Data perfect. bit gamble, given children futures??

It's also gamble cripple economies, overlook ailments, ignore negative effects mental health—and affect children, too.

This ""black-and-white"" problem. ""try least harm using variables know"" problem. get special award posting banned subreddits?  edited out! I'm sorry. really sucks. 

At least nearly attempt ease back kind normalcy. 

I think take awhile though. 

Unless touch deprived ass gets drunk invites tinder boy over. 

I tend go big go home, I'm already home. political decision along, nothing effectiveness vaccine Obviously not, meaningless goal day made.

Anyway, put less emphasis politicians say do, like said, imo Biden good front. logic place here, downvotes coming people realized took unapproved drug Kids pain take trips young age anyways. remember appreciate time they're adults.  article gave two reasons: can’t used US *yet* created Defense Production Act meaning, among things, anything produced direction DPA requires release president. 

Don’t know you’re US not, things add political nightmare. Vaccines becoming available every day means point supply hand considered expendable. 

There’s also issue liability FDA comes in. Say goes without EUA harms people EU. happens then? US liable? AstraZeneca? Both? Would EU agree waive ability remedy situation? Would EU citizens agree get vaccine another country wouldn’t use weren’t sure yet EU agreed hold liable said vaccine fact harmful? 

It’s like it’s active surplus going waste. surplus US isn’t going waste held storage. It’s much complicated “sitting it” complex active issues. Guestimating, probably spent anywhere 600-1000 dollars month eating + caffeine covid. Since cooked every meal year able pay car 2 years early back December. Kind bitter sweet knowing much money used waste. go mods, one Yup, thats alluding to. stopped shopping Kroger’s closed two stores. performance art. move along Same, closed house February 28th lol. like near city regardless though complaints here. Also thanks covid demand area skyrocketed people wanting leave city close by, bought good time Can’t gonorrhea infection clear eventually? I’ve frustrated lack holistic perspective public health media messaging wouldn’t call Fauci huckster. vaccines FDA approved. people shout want reason FDA approved, it’s haven’t met required safety endpoint 6 months minimum follow up... safety. need someone hand feed might good idea, even might afraid labeled “anti”.

As soon vaccine developed put lot time educating vaccine development clinical studies such.

Doing made clear anything developed less 4-5 years probably wouldn’t touching lol.

But, 8-9 months!!! 
Fuck noooooo.

I see commercials tv pills minor problems, side effects listed right commercial. pills developed years.

What kind side effects vaccine 5-10 years?

How affect pregnant women, women get pregnant get vaccine?
What effects baby?

So many questions many answers. ""Leadership looks like taking credit something already going happen.""

You know though, exactly wrong. Tons people leadership positions that. Except employer calls foolish wanting vaccine. Hi, you? I'm a_time_to_krill. know one more.

I'd venture say nearly us, dramatic rise among started family yet. agree reasons like based policy, met anyone believed birth certificate scandal, yes did. racially motivated. remember anyone questioning trump biden born. Theres reason that. No. I’ll contact local vaccination center ask. specific bad batch number 2856?  Heck yes. Why? someone worried getting Covid plane, couldn’t get vaccinated first? force everyone it? different China did. don’t see Chinese vaccines shunned government history lying numbers. Complex evolving structures. That’s good way putting it. hope get paper published. do, DM me.

Obviously something like work jobs can't done remotely. I’ve read vaccine doesn’t prevent transmitting it. It’s reduce severity symptoms get covid no? Okay. Well luckily us all, FDA doesn’t consider “we’ve given hundreds millions doses uhh u/jsawden doesn’t think side effects besides flu like symptoms” scientific evidence.

These vaccines emergency use authorized, approved.

Are aware difference? 

EUA requires 2 months follow full approval requires 6 safety. thought pro-science, ever stop think FDA might require 6 months safety follow might be, dunno, *necessary* establish safety?

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well, maybe Italy send batch Australia. clients basically Covid screening form since started letting last July. symptoms push meeting two weeks. Yet, many democratically elected governments are.

When Americans become huge fans expropriation private companies? No, companies can't impose terms employees. can't impose rule first newborn child given human sacrifice CEO, can't impose employees certain skin colors genders etc. I'm sure vaccination falls regarding surprised making vaccination mandatory without associated law force would put companies potential legal troubles require would make sense would years. Pfizer Moderna planning fully authorized April. statement pretty irrelevant. J&amp;J months later likely. really need get message across 55% fact 55% less chance catching ...people keep thinking 100 people catch 45 definitely catch ...100% severe disease matters ...pretty much virologists heard worried variants think I'll actually ok, plan adults eligible May 1st vaccination, summer gonna fucking awesome. unnecessary... Right? someone get paid working overtime allowed endanger lives coworkers? pretty much same. Silly redditors.  miserable existence. 

We're going segregate poor minorities got bad info vaccine getting that? Sounds like great plan. Actually, clients allowed come in, almost certainly sort form they'll fill start meetings again. trivial concern.  Ask CU Boulder wish luck PIE Pi Day 2021 (Sunday). :) sure. We'll also high percentage germaphobes habits stick far beyond necessary.

We'll generation kids missed whole year school. generation who, subtle ways, impacted starting lives seen mostly masked faces. big change, big changes... change things.

We're resilient bunch, think we'll okay. People live sorts things come stronger. However, many also experience trauma come weaker before. hope support necessary mental health resources get us this. I'm reading comments thread think people missing forest trees.

Yes, vaccines mandatory certain places employment (such hospitals military) school districts tested long period time. know vaccines safe short term reason believe change long term. also know COVID-19 killed half million Americans last year. public health perspective, employers schools would silly mandate vaccine people allergic/immunocompromised.

If like it, find another job home school kids. FFS, employer likely expansive code conduct; really think can't mandate working office requires vaccine? make reasonable accommodations (work home possible) unvaccinated, legal hurdle here. wanted wait get J J. You’d think killed puppy. Sorry want one specific option? That’s normal vaccines don’t literally everyone world working one unlimited funding massive test group clinical trials. 

The FDA looked across every single clinical trial vaccines average time takes longer term side effect show 2 months, hence made sure clinical trials met timeframe approving emergency approval. 

We don’t know long term side effects covid either. Ok got second stab, waited 2 hours line good. Apparently bled time ahaha  Yeah like they've handled vaccination drive quite well far simplistic? would say ""draconian"" extreme. Inability compromise see things complex evolving structures. deadly global pandemic threatening, lol. germ theory work? Doubtful, common cold 200 viruses!  Please restrict returning office.  True someone says ""small gathering"" assume personal nature. Get state actually let people make decisions themselves.

(Sorry, trying rude. I'm feeling little spicy morning. Weather nice I'm feeling light end tunnel. hope soon find :) ) Shame one UK allowed go :(  essentially saying setting goals meeting somehow bad thing

No... I'm saying setting goal already going met pointless. say I'm going direct sun rise tomorrow morning, much fucking credit get that? understand people would support measures, think type scheme perpetuate ingrain inequities, hurt vulnerable populations. might think benefits worth cost, think case long term. Eligible doesn’t mean available though. Still going year lot people get vaccine.  American capable reading news article, accusing politician like liar? Big surprise. Interesting read. really explain went wrong though.   appropriate forum political discussions. I'm cognizant human rights issues Dubai, someone living US, I'm position posing holy pictures either.  wrong thinking it’s simplistic thinking? It’s logical way looking opinion. Daily vaccination outpacing daily cases orders magnitude, cases hospitalizations falling since January peak. I’m pretty line thought. leadership looks like. agree idea 'that par gone.' think would've ended like anyway, way thought think would ended maturing/growing 'adult' well pandemic happened, case would've good transition one stage another case felt like old person experience sort spiritual (and one particular incident far close physical) death shaky rebirth. 

Regardless, though, I'm deal whoever whatever future holds  isn’t defeating all. happening record time keep mind he’s speaking whole country. area cases high vaccination rates there’s reason things won’t open sooner local level. fine good, know keeping vaccine exported hurt feelings. think government that.  

My point Americans whining crying hurt feelings. loser sentiment. distribute vaccine, help everyone, move on. right thing prevents variants emerging, variants could potentially delay return normal.  

I see many, many fellow Americans super soft, 10 ply babies. crying masks they're crying countries called names. Get fuck right thing.  criticism dumb, essentially saying setting goals meeting somehow bad thing. Right, certain point people need risk assessment. 

And real risk assessment, extremely early minority fraction population vaccinated rates still higher May.

The desire start meeting people easing burden placed individuals (because government respond appropriately would sacrifice corporate gods could) comes sick taking burden believing vaccinated = immunity transmission. general public understand basics vaccination issue campaign communicate them, despite vaccines real plan US months They're 90% effective virus that's certainly less 1% IFR (CDC data pegged around 0.3%).

A statistic requires knowing efficacy means vaccine studies, tend overestimate real-world performance. 

And two facts hidden dismissing IFR, already much higher similarly contagious diseases:

1. evenly distributed. IFR high immune compromised. elderly, pregnant, steroids etc, diseases compromise immune systems.

2. negative outcomes aside know everyone encourages everyone get flu vaccines people running around office without it, generally much less effective (50% 0.1% IFR virus). 

The norm flu vaccines also wrong pointlessly almost likelihood, Covid vaccinated danger flu (0.3%/10 vs. 0.1%/2).

Framed purely self-interested sense ignoring variation within population, prioritizing majority health large minority risk. reason? make anti-vaxxers feel vindicated? meet indoors rather outdoors family months? trade-offs speaks nothing age stratification 30, probably risk flu anyway.

Because viruses affect individual infected.  got mine. always self conscious people saw me, friend said. ""You you."" stuck me. ok acted, even meant quiet person saying random things. accept comfortable that, anxiety fades away. 

Social anxiety roots comfortable feeling like fit society, whereas social people typically quite confident are, even think issue. 

That's two cents it. I’m cool segregated covid deniers antivaxxers. Deniers responsible suffering rest us endured last year contribute continued suffering. yeah- means you, far away rest us.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  merely saying EU would doses export 34M+ them.

USA's success come expense countries. example, Canada bought great number doses really hard time getting them. relying doses sent EU India. time USA, neighbour, sitting great manufacturing capacity (and also tens millions unused AZ doses).

Not EU handled great either way, cheaped way much early on. Bullshit! dumb fucking statement. friend still lung issues six months getting Covid. Tell soft country. submit time that. steal doses damage Pfizer’s reputation something caused AstraZeneca? what? Perhaps vaccinating EU population 2 weeks earlier? don’t get it.. you’re vaccinated, cares others aren’t? You’re protected ill effects virus. still spread it, vaccine doesn’t stop that.

If anything, it’s ideal case scenario: antivaxxers, right-wingers nut jobs refuse vaccine, get sick, ideally die. would neat way move forward society. routine physical summer 2020 lady drew blood (not sure phlebotomists nurses not) gave earful Covid catch get it, big deal etc. etc. nodded along needle sticking arm come on... one subject debate came first. ""ain't"" propaganda. OR: get vaccine need worry. certain agency planted seeds people's minds early masks even effective, could worked much better. I'll say certain former president.

However, masks cut public spread, main reason masks work people use private. Typical Republican viciousness hope never see look someone’s eyes hopelessly gasp breath they’re dying COVID. I’ve seen that. 

But that’s worth long get go buffet Golden Corral, right? Get perspective life, please. Something like would least wait vaccines fully FDA approved, right now, - granted Emergency Use Authorization, lower bar, despite often people like repeat misleading things like “they’ve gone process”. [EUA requires 2 month safety follow compared 6 full approval, requires “ FDA must determine known potential benefits outweigh known potential risks vaccine”

Obviously, determination made societal level opposed individual level. Someone’s risk highly modulated health record.

Those follow claiming “no mechanisms” vaccine like could damage either uninformed lying - [this 2018 describes several concerns, written several PhDs *lot* knowledge subject Potential safety concerns likely evaluated future preclinical clinical studies include local systemic inflammation, biodistribution persistence expressed immunogen, stimulation auto-reactive antibodies potential toxic effects non-native nucleotides delivery system components.

Basically, effects lipid nanoparticles, long persist, effect RNA floating around (which way, don’t fully understand, since seems immune modulating effects different directions) - enough concern scientists mention.

(Note one authors paper asked comment regards auto-immunity, believes it’s issue due specific type mRNA used. don’t know enough comment that, thought worth mentioning.)

Many people claim “these development 10 years, they’re new” - yes, they’ve development, [partly due safety 2020, mRNA biotech companies poor results testing mRNA drugs cardiovascular, metabolic renal diseases; selected targets cancer; rare diseases like Crigler–Najjar syndrome, finding side-effects mRNA insertion serious.

[...] LNPs looked good lab often floundered clinic, however. first versions ionizable lipids still toxic. early formulations nanoparticles didn’t degrade fast enough, causing accumulate repeated injections. 

Luckily BioNTech-Pfizer Moderna released publicly LNP formulations, assuage concerns safety toxicity particles.

To clear I’m saying think vaccines dangerous, people pretending like there’s way could harmed EUA full approval daft. studies mixing vaccines. suspicion mixing vaccines first second shots might effective. think saw studies completed summer. know much this, two types nurses, one requiring way education other? Maybe nurses refusing vaccine less educated group? Even Newton believed god clockmaker hey, take chances possible lab created virus short long term effects, vs vaccine entire world stopped for, funded contributed using top scientists hundreds thousands volunteers clinical trials. 


Your body gambling with. Except medical treatment private matter. really, half garbage media england.

It's much earth that. main issue protective enough south african variant currently spreading.

I took AZ shot, I'm confident France provide us booster whole different vaccine eventually provide immunity.

Sanofi candidate vaccine entering test phases soon. Maybe one. We'll see. Exactly. People keep talking like huge deal. May 1st millions people put names list get line make appointment get shot. Okay, running rails here. yes, first one insane, technically could, there's laws particularly, haha, second one obvious. something like this? private company right work state? absolutely could. Depends states' existing employment laws. PA, right work state, set anything want fire cause.   whinging whining. whinging complaining. masks... Personally I'd reschedule donation vaccine.

I donated yesterday, told get Pfizer Moderna side effects donate basically right away. ask wait day two make sure feel okay.

If get non-mRNA might longer deferral period, sure that. little science? Microbiology, bioscience, chemistry, biochemistry, anatomy + physiology x2, pathophysiology lack science training? career, I’ve absolutely met physicians believe kinds weird shit. Don’t forget Trump plenty COVID denying doctors parade around (two Stanford) one believes demons cause endometriosis. people believe bullshit despite training. right infect fellow coworkers share shitty, windowless, non-ventilated office experience Constitution. plants Europe seem issues; AZ wanted make importing US, UK, India, none would allow exports.

Kind understandable, something would happen supplies, would terrible optics.

Biden said though US stay exporting vaccines everybody, supposed May. wonder lot year effected young kids, kids still learning socialization things like that. year isolation learning playing peers effect them? Something guess won’t see quite years.

There’s already mental health crisis right IMO - 3 best friends antidepressants anti anxiety medication year. see people developing form PTSD CPTSD year terrified sick, hoarding food/supplies, people turning other. No, agree sentiment. Regardless leisure professional intentions, government judge this. example, might find new business opportunities holiday could combine business travel couple days leisure. 

We principled approach, one operates slippery slope. Wide-scale exclusion activities based medical background regarded discrimination. Perhaps lawful (I honestly know*), current situation novel seems careful. decision making open, participatory, transparent informed ethical philosophical components decision making. right sit cubicle course! Smart move, getting argument moron holding needle really worth arguing someone petulant ignorant you. Hahaha half million deaths.

I'm laughing.

Get vaccinated stay away me. I'm letting make parents senior coworkers statistic. saw video someone Prague stopped police wearing mask walking non-crowded street. Insanity. It’s crazy, haven’t stopped working going store whole thing. traveled across America, gas station, rest stops hotels....

And haven’t gotten sniffles once.

So tell would inclined get vaccine know average vaccine takes way longer develop. 

When one family gotten sick.

Can see point view? I’m surprised allowed. wife X-ray tech awhile absolutely allowed work unless shots. 

You easily infect someone vulnerable health facility. Poor purchasing decisions vaccines starters, individuals within system wanting tight control priority, rather distributing GP's let deal it.

In addition, vaccination always hot topic Yes, well put think gets lost lot arguments. Believe me, I'm *all* personal freedoms government staying kinds decisions, etc., refusing vaccination risky COVID exposure behavior personal choice, also potentially affecting others say choice. mask up. Stop crying piece cloth, look really pathetic weak minded year this. studio requires wear mask it’s choice....just like require wear certain clothes (and shoes) mat. Lol, nah back kids got told shut suck up. deranged existence truly believe health responsibility includes injecting whatever tell body Oh know. mums doctor one nurse knew talking something saw Facebook pfizer. Baffles highly educated yet still believe dumb shit Facebook assume probably like getting yearly flu shot, get ever available you. Coordinating verifying Pfizer Dude months years later seems like clusterf*ck waiting happen.

Then I'm random guy internet could totally wrong that. Yes! talk therapist lot. Even things still fun usually come level guilt anxiety, afterwards even feel like much fun. 

I've vaccinated month still hard time convincing ok see people maybe even \_gasp\_ go restaurant sometime. 1.5 recommend never get vaccine. take medicine. matter eat drink anything. small chance long term consequence kill later on. BC started taking appointments 85 up... I'm part vaccine yet, wanted weigh clots. got 23, Subclavian Thrombosis due Thorasic Outlet Syndrome leading Pulmonary Embosisms, still Post Thrombotic Syndrome day (28 year). definitely happens 30, shit happens. Can't wait vaccine, one ""essentials"" since stated Florida.

Luckily donate blood get antibody tests back several times year far test negative, I've little apprehensive I'd handle Covid history... Guess means can't back up? Got it. Good luck life! less folks think vaccine safe somehow condensed 50 years vaccine development single year really didn't.

That's say accomplishment less impressive. I'm concerned benefits praising accomplishment threat people using fuel justify fears receiving it. Finger Lakes wineries come! way COVID virus operates, *just* personal choice. work others, field, choice putting others risk well. Im ok means vaccine ones US Europe. feel that, look data. thing preventing cases 95% people get it. 5% get get severe cases. Take time sure full confidence get full doses, 2-3 weeks very, safe virus substantial harm you, all.  Eventually case, isn’t now. Simulations spike protein show 600fold increases ACE2 binding enthalpy possible. South African strain 20x higher binding, least year mutations available max out. smart get ahead vaccines massively reduce mortality illness. proportionate? Yes.

Was balanced geared towards success? No.

Basic public health principles (the stuff teach first year med school):

1) Abstinence-only education work. 

Control AIDS pandemic telling people sex? Extremely ineffective. Prohibition? Extremely ineffective. Let's go ahead throw ""general social distancing"" onto list. Telling people interact others like above, significantly difficult adhere to.

2) best interventions automatic. Second best enforceable. 

Automatic would containment early stage, spread extremely local. requires nothing general public. Closest automatic vaccines. General social distancing farthest thing automatic enforceable. Much closer interventions like mass testing (worked amazingly universities tested students 2x/week). could achieved pooled testing, even supplies low. Contact tracing go along it. Focused development fast tracking hundreds proposed high throughput testing methods various top labs across country. Better ventilation (e.g. updated HVAC systems, open windows) specific policy widely accepted public health staple (i.e. advertised like hand washing).

From enforceable standpoint, stay-at-home orders, destructive, bigger ""bang buck"" enforceable. close restaurants people wind dinner parties even riskier environments, killed small business without much COVID. stay-at-home order least ensures COVID cases fall, faster middle-of-the-road restrictions.

That's really boils to. lost minds year public health experts abandoned basic principles. Politics reinforced it. EEOC already issued guidance saying allow employers require coronavirus vaccine see fit Wow. There’s lot process article none good. Half UKs vaccines AZ half pfizer. manufacturing facility pfizer all. unless thr UK found another source receive pfizer deliveries expoets would pfizer AZ. vaccine production UK Novavax AZ. swollen lymph mode symptoms. Went doctor week prescribed antibiotics. effect started looking harder. Biopsy finally found small tumor back tonsil. tonsillectomy margins smaller liked opted follow radiation. clear now. Early detection/action key.  random insults. I’m sure continuing discussion fruitful..../s Yet fastest vaccine ever created sixties, right?

Weird, wonder is. we? People whined cried masks, science changed data changes, distancing others.  

The healthcare workers, grocery store workers, people making minimum wage deal customers either cried wearing masks cried others wearing masks - strong people. kept us going. ones speaking about. Yeah making painful costly enough. like drunk driving danger others. Even discount current death rate, large unvaccinated population lead variants current vaccines aren’t good against. want drunk stay home designated driver, want get COVID vaccine stay home prove free weekly monthly tests pay pocket. Like said, already know long term side effects almost always show within 2 months. That’s science data, friend. 

How know vaccines use every kid gets vaccinated don’t cause cancer 30 years? don’t, there’s way prove that. 

What long term covid issues? know happen. think misunderstood ""all exports"". means using Pfizer make AZ shortfall. Got mine couple days ago. Almost cried knowing almost see posts like Reddit pray platform isn’t representative population whole. 

It’s amazing many people truly believe freedom choice ‘dumb.’ getting downvotes, agree whole heartedly. bad policy downplay power vaccines. shouting rooftops vaccine way out. expecting supply vaccine skyrocket next two three months. American adults get shot soon. 

After curtain point summer, overwhelming majority non-vaccinated adults way choice. people absolutely restricted, ongoing threat immunocompromised. Yea dice champ. allowed spread among deranged anti masker anti vaxxer types mutate, eventually make vaccines less effective took them. nothing. Take vaccine don’t participate society think people reading many small gatherings statement last night July 4. Small gatherings always default vast majority us holidays. specifically mentioned spending time family, neighbors friends. He's saying family household members like last year. He's saying something like four people even ten. Unless celebrity every time get together family friends small event. 

A large event 4th full baseball stadium maybe crowded fireworks show. may table yet. Maybe so. Biden tendency err side caution. top large events need planned ahead months advance. possible large events happen simply someone today decided there's enough time plan. 

I get people reading much it. Even take statement rule law statement indicates summer holiday enjoyed damn near way vast majority us always done. 
Have bbq. Go beach. Go pop fireworks. Go pool. Well CDC doesn’t recommend vaccine it’s 90 days past COVID infection. it’s reason it’s uninformed. double still need year two. really isn't.

Currently, message vaccinated unvaccinated still spread Covid, vaccine prevents serious illness. Therefore, matter person hang vaccinated not, much chance spreading unvaccinated person.

And beyond that, even vaccine prevent spread, 90% effective lowers level risk average person vaccinated flu given year. still risk? Yes. point, people need develop appropriate risk levels stop relying government tell is. lol wut? Oh geez lol. valid reason would agree masks became highly charged political shit storm. think it’s wrong say mRNA production simple cheap.  It’s proven reliable able scaled pretty effectively Pfizer Moderna (Pfizer especially) doesn’t equal cheap easy.  still requires brand new tech processes. yes, much process including lipid nanoparticles since tech doesn’t work without that... changed ""Only people get injected see friends colleagues again"". Yeah 100%. I’m aware vaccines pipeline years, honestly people don’t read much. It’s frustrating, even browsing sub see lot people speaking confidently despite completely wrong No, don’t. Lol They’ve Georgia while, that’s mom able get vaccinated parents got months ago could've done math own. Group 3 March 3rd. Group 4 begins April 4th duh, group 5 whenever say, ok group 5. mean doses. whole thing poorly thought out. wanted go Walgreens, STOP, acct. set account. entered info group 3. checking 3 times day past week, see single appointment next Monday. say Yeah click it. askes redundant questions logged Walgreens account get screens told, Sorry, appointments. I'm group 3 going go get lucky? stupid system. Ask shit account click apointment time book it. Yesterday grape vine work, co-worker debating getting shot becuase attends church 2 doctors apparently telling congregation bother.

I little flabbergasted. questioned doctrine in, gave answer. Also anything like 3 people call hot mess everyone sit silence time able understand others saying. 

Also also spend whole work day video calls already. last thing want ""fun"" afterwards fucking video calls. truly understand medicine refuse vaccine. level cognitive dissonance living unreal. JNJ one largest companies world. making vaccines came existence. also make literally everything odds personally used one products last week pretty great. 

Janssen (who made vaccine) isn’t even group makes baby powder product. group makes vaccines flu made covid vaccine. decades experience developing vaccine yea would trust start company who’s 1st vaccine covid shot. Ask why, find nothing ""they must know something they're healthcare."" exactly reasons aunt Facebook saw YouTube video. Trust this. bigoted? Back up, bb. Yes. care makes someone think me, healthcare position, armed services, etc., refuse vaccine willingly, placed leave get vaccine. Especially healthcare, sworn protect people harm ignorantly intentionally putting patients risk refusing vaccine. shit place medicine, all. Yeah keep watching Florida canary mine I’m seeing obvious trends it’s surge even little. Miami plateau little bit also seem slowly trending again. state seems average case numbers trends compared states  Texas well rollout vs Oklahoma Yeah, lot videos people Texas Florida essentially saying screw it, way represents entire country Honestly fuck mean recognize death outcome virus, right? Young, healthy people felled heart lung failure MONTHS Covid. Yeah, blood clots insignificant statistically. TBH *you* seem much worked propaganda *you're* hearing.


The issue we're here, individuals, healthcare workers, everyone know, AZ *does protect us SA variant currently spreading France*.

That's it. effective enough picking pace.

I took shot nonetheless, half-ass chance better none definetely feel protected immunized, all. case noticed, normal daily lives heavily disrupted many activities social things used outright banned.

...because global pandemic. realize life would continued undisrupted government done nothing. lot less concerned unvaccinated people I've vaccinated. already happened last Easter last Christmas well. uncomfortable, it’s good thing. means body learning fight. infectious disease doctor said like 4+ hours symptoms it’s okay take Tylenol get relief. get people reading much it.

The people parsing words politicians public health officials reading tea leaves potential future slight get angry squint right way maybe ""small gatherings"" *could plausibly interpreted maybe* exclude backyard bbq neighbors something even though nobody charge actually suggested tight restrictions like summer practice seeing safety guidelines relaxing mirror image people scouring news one day tiny bumps case counts new study slightly reduced immune responses variant hype panic responses predict coming surge cases keeps arriving. Sure, except that's entirely theoretical spreading COVID not. say that’s arrived number? use method mentioned, also get 95% People continue die covid worldwide foreseeable future - long restrictions removed across entire US. Heck still people dying covid right US foreseeable future. paranoid people also continue social distancing wearing masks months years come. two points alone enough say pandemic 'not over'. Whats worse talk ""healthcare professional trust vaccine. get it.""

No. That's Jan. nurse, got associate's degree. important job, authority science behind talking about. really think would emergency approve vaccine would slim chance would get full approval?

Do think pulling data ass emergency approval? Haha. Well put (even disagree current interpretation second amendment). :) Supply chain disruptions happen. smart ready event EUA FDA. UK problems AZ vaccine made UK factories either.

However note UK regulator, MHRA, gave AZ Pfizer emergency authorisation - means every single batch checked regulator quality sent vaccination centres. time consuming chief bottleneck Uk vaccine rollout.

India also given emergency authorisation, means regulator also checking every single batch.

The EU's regulator, EMA, gave standard licence means say they're happy manufacturing process need check batch. think save work. 

Looks like UK made right call given new vaccines factories set speed. J&amp;J vaccine tested UK African variants virus. IDEA effective Pfizer, Moderna, etc variants tested environments present like J&amp;J been.

Right vaccine data effectiveness UK African variant J&amp;J

This I'm choosing take J&amp;J get it. take others backup cant get J&amp;J

J&amp;J vaccine available shows pretty damn effective multiple variants covid.  That's equivalent argument know it. Stop disingenuous. ""You trying cancel right sicken death"" inconvenient could potentially mean lives lost, dude... Oh fucks sake...please tell stupid ask question. 

1. I'm selfish prick people world matter.

2. Immune compromised people might able vaccine affected countries morons trying travel spread it. news high efficacy Novavax vaccine, wanted see much, EU ordered. can't seem find recent news this. latest could find mid-Februrary stating close closing deal. European Commission site even info recent talks December! anyone recent news order? Actually medical school University Bologna one oldest respected medical institutions world. Perhaps ""hydrogenated vegetable oil"" would better reach. boss shared staff getting vaccinated inkling avoid coming back work person. job can't effectively done home seems think be. dont. wanna anti vaxx bonehead long around vulnerable constantly(say nursing home) see much reason force get it. virus huge percentage recover? currently deal single recurring virus kills many people COVID currently does. say 500,000 people dead? COVID killed people WWII want let run course? regular flu vaccine mandated professional settings COVID killed people single year almost 10-fold highest number flu single year recent memory.  feel like teams get Indiana it’ll fine part. next week probably rocky though. way going absolutely unhinged summer I'm fully vaccinated.... Enjoy Westvleteren Rochefort me. physicians scientists warned, gene-based vaccines could cause blood coagulation.

RNs different skill set, typically better trained job calls do. can't cure douche. refuse vaccine still spread covid 

But vaccinated, care? Wait, first would know person B even passed A?  Person could've passed B B wasmt vaccinated they're accused? 

I'm mean honestly say first case like unless person B like week flu like illness. 
Based say makes even sense keep mask mandatory since people vaccine ones spreading without knowing. vaccine working anymore (since cure all) gonna everywhere We're lucky world completely black white. Imagine educated people wanted wait little see safe taking vaccine in, reaction vaccine, get sick? No. There's live virus vaccine.

She still get COVID even shot, although protection kicks within week two. you. would come exposure someone live virus. physicians scientists warned, gene-based vaccines could cause blood coagulation.

But holy shit hammer come someone tell Vaccines seem job...I personally returned normal life choice. also think private business within rights require it. vaccinate? it’s like cannot spread it, I’m vaccinated I'm freedom speech, I'm also consequences actions. There's right lie people they'll harm themselves, ought hold people accountable.

The social media platforms fucked bigtime allowing stuff. world completely unaccountable bullshit people said platforms, shitty job maintaining basic level decency they're going get broken regulated.  Terrifying people choice what’s injected bodies... right, letting 500,000+ people die like trump probably best move instead getting everyone vaccinated May 1, re-opening everything, beginning recover economy trump left ruins.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Considering much thing costing governments businesses, can't believe governments everywhere paying people get vaccinated. show identity (so pay people multiple times), get injections, get proof vaccination cash hand. People refuse believe would still get injections get cash. End pandemic. negotiating US release American stockpile - Biden told world that’s happening every American jabbed. Britain secured 10m doses AZ Indian plants - couldn’t go EU? Oops, EU hasn’t approved Indian plant yet. EU hasn’t approved vaccine world’s biggest supplier vaccine yet. We’ve emergency year, EU still haven’t got round inspecting world’s biggest vaccine plant? High EU standards, plain incompetence? fuck even saying?  Yea, everyone get vaccinated stop spread Aye, that's did. got early, 10am. I'm shocked. Read further.

After section deep vein thrombosis (which part blood clots cause), article events, causal relationship Janssen COVID-19 vaccine cannot determined. assessment causality confounded presence underlying medical conditions may predisposed individuals events. Sure! think people important sidestep technical usage words (like ""theory"") skip straight colloquial realism (""thing true, least indistinguishable truth""). done vaccine evenly distributed across thew world.

We probably would wait 2023 finish global production ensure orderly distribution every community earth..  even communities would refuse participate. choice affect person making choice. making choice receive vaccine come workplace, willingly endangering others. So, vaccines available everyone, I'm immunocompromised person can't vaccine... live life house, never going outside risking human contact, quarter population decided take easily available, insanely-low-risk vaccination shot, keeping dangerous disease alive spreading back forth among themselves. Sounds fair. question can't find answer anyone help. girlfriend live together, getting vaccinated tomorrow. I'm line vaccine sometime next week. get sick developed symptoms? stay separate rooms we're vaccinated? BSN’s classes research, leadership, public health repeated nursing. It’s mostly fluff, definitely hard science. Even ones know nursing degree questionable opinions suuucked! Hahaha Yeah don’t kids grandkids warms heart see reunions. Visual representation country world beginning heal gene therapy. basically nothing genes genetics. Imagine people started widely. lot people even trying, much less flu Norovirus. work retail seen people even bother wash hands normal circumstances. would nice see people become least little careful going forward. new diseases future.  Thanks. you’re curious 2038 that’s Harambe would eligible run due 35 year old requirement President. Looks like opposite tbh Back 80's/90's told ""no one likes tattle-tale."" Slippery slope fallacy dentist office getting cleaning hygienist proudly told none getting shot....... mouth wide open hands there...... I've going guy 20 plus years, vaccinated return 6 months I'm finding new one. False *Especially* right work state. Honestly they’re exhausting like texting. doses could sent countries can’t afford need more.

My mother works nursing home (logistics) got outbreak there. elderly people mild symptoms, one died (65 inhabitants).

Now, vaccine (Pfizer believe, sure), “aren’t anymore” constantly tired. Nearly got sick vaccine, fine.

Vaccinating people necessary, risk far higher die without it. isn’t without risks, definitely affect you’re already fragile.

There’s reason get vaccinated point. It’s even turn anyway (I’m Belgian - we’re slow) is, hopefully isn’t needed anymore. probably underestimating people natural immunity anyways.

We’re almost through. Wish well.  Please export ban. like UK USA.  Google translate:

In view beginning third corona wave, Robert Koch Institute (RKI) called citizens continue comply protective measures. ""Together keep third wave flat possible,"" said institute director Lothar Wieler Friday Berlin. important avoid getting situation like Christmas, many illnesses, severe courses deaths well heavy burden health system. pandemic marathon, according Wieler - last, particularly strenuous third.

It take time majority population vaccinated. ""Until then, ask us continue adhere AHA + L rules,"" Wieler appealed. abbreviation stands distance, hygiene, wearing mask ventilation. Contacts also continue reduced. vaccination next ""our responsible personal behavior"" powerful tool, said RKI boss. ""The best protection low incidence.""

""The situation remains tense""

The number cases Germany leveled high level time, explained RKI boss Wieler. incidences rose people 60 years age - ""very rapidly"" since mid-February children adolescents 15 years. day-care outbreaks observed again, even Christmas. could contagious variant B.1.1.7 plays role here. federal states, number cases intensive care units also increasing slightly.

Federal Minister Health Jens Spahn also warned careful Corona crisis view increasing number infections. ""The situation remains tense,"" said CDU politician Friday Berlin. One still prepared “some challenging weeks”, balance health protection longed-for return normality struggled cautious openings.

Spahn said vaccination campaign clearly gaining momentum. seven percent population vaccinated least once. recently 270,000 vaccinations day nationwide. Doctors' practices also vaccinate early possible - later mid-April. view calls earlier start, Spahn explained initially enough vaccine available supply practices and, time, vaccination centers federal states municipalities wanted continue operate.  neurosis infesting humanity intense selfishness we're witnessing. Millions lives lost could easily cut half less everyone sucked fuck wore mask stayed home while. we're sitting safe remarkable vaccines people still get ego bubble take greater good.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Damn dude sorry wake somewhere 10am PLEASE GIVE VACCINE smear campaign again. Millions people vaccinated Oxford vaccine. 20 million India alone. Big Pharma business. Efforts spread bad PR common.
Remember French President Macron? lot bad PR, France recommended yrs Get points, totally make sense - f/u questions would be:

-at percentage total population need vaccinated order prevent virus mutating rendering vaccines ineffective? measured? 

I’m concerned don’t clear goals/benchmarks in-place we’re working towards - seems like we’re likely chasing tails powers determine we’re ok resume normal life... appointments too, vaccines left go line. know many leftovers may get sites, can't make appointments those. also get non-leftover vaccines appointments. can’t wait era “Papers, ~~bitte~~ please” come America! Clearly, first comment made clear sure said minimal experience. asked new information every step way open it, *because sure*, reason read means I'm pedaling something. Yes, ER previously employed at, PA NP used interchangeably ""not really emergency/minor broken things"" section. Yeah every time brought remind people us can’t get vaccine health reasons. forget exist. you’re going require vaccine card, you’re going accept vaccine exemption card well. worry places won’t want to. Maybe become ADA thing? needs sort rules infrastructure place protect us discrimination.  Shitty life pro tip: get vaccinated, tell everyone refuse get vaccinated, stay home, literal profit. Well considering HIPPA regs think lawyer may able use fund early retirement. Besides would require new employees many businesses validate enter can't, checkout retail stores would make point fill buggy cold items leave put away went got another buggy store try again. poll included 1,005 people. That’s small sample. No, sorry dude, paid Big Pharma, subsidized US. US getting first crack. Enjoy! Canada killed cruises. I've one particular friend UK watch news pay attention current affairs, either home abroad, seems know things U.S. election rigged (she know thing government, let alone foreign one) corona virus vaccine sort device that's going track kill you, depending way wind blowing day it. 

I ask got amazing information seen anywhere? wonderful trustworthy source get mindblowing facts from? answer always same.....Facebook. Alas, area (Pasco) seeing less patients testing - people going work sick, testing ordered employers. Whole families showing again. Numerous elderly got vaccination, two days later exposed ""thought good"". 

It's people careless, misunderstand CDC instructions. parts Pasco extremely high vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities include age, living conditions, language barriers. Recently seeing Spanish speakers elderly. 

DeSantis pop-up vaccination clinic address shortfall vaccinations Pasco. illustrates lack leadership local government officials, hard work bringing new businesses income region without offering substantial infrastructure needed sustain work there. 

During last shopping runs experiences clinic shown higher 80% residents absolutely guidance wear use mask. Fewer 10% wear masks correctly, 5% refuse wear mask clinic (and turned away) - 50% shoppers wear masks all. 

I honestly hope vaccinations ramp up, we'll see end this. present, severe outbreak remains danger must guard against. Residents continue pass away due fear hospitals, lack immediate care, underlying conditions. could remedied, not, apparently never. sad. It’s that’s selfish ignorant viewpoint. Similar wearing masks. 
There lot people can’t get vaccine cancer reason immune system compromised. rely everyone else around get vaccine cool stuff vaccinated people get like public without worrying dipshit killing don’t want get vaccine. get freaking vaccination. I’m sick tired forced work office in-person still considered phase 1-C. go work infect everyone make stay home sick next week. impacts employer’s business. employer still interest allowing vaccinated people office. tourists residents. makes city pay infrastructure residents need. problem politicians killed cruises. Wonder even start year. Wait, already filed got refund, file amendment? Oh still getting vaccine. sure.
I want also vaccinated office. style injection used MERS SARS, shot mandated federally prior longitudinal study examining long term outcomes? first mutation came mink farm. billions animals cages close together get infected human could transmit hundreds thousands animals aren’t vaccinated. 

I think that’s part people talking about. realistic option lessen reliance animal agriculture. mention animal agriculture also causes new pandemics. smart. AZ demonstrates happens rely foreign suppliers, particularly hostile nations. You’ve framed government capable harming, it’s also political question government refuse provide adequate relief. People would lot receptive sacrifice they’re getting completely fucked. whole world bend base public health legislation around single, specific circumstance wanting wear mask grappling respiratory issue? giving hard time. Offices suck life ya. don’t tell work getting it. Legally can’t access info without consent. Nurse Practitioner (NP) seems be, like, sort equivalent Physician’s Assistant (PA), actually prescribe medication. many booster shots going be? number 3 4? think city council ones bullied.

The guy casting vote clearly felt wrong stop mandate felt pressured anyway. appeal people applaud decision gives impression charged atmosphere. whole thing paints pretty grim picture. ah yes i'm privileged lose job dying field. Yes, essential employees deserve way more, stop acting like getting railed system. Ah, correct! people willingly endangering others past 12 months? vaccine then? Vaccines infinite amount power. fact, healthy bodies 99% chance fighting virus. friend mine calculated saved 21 days worth time commute past year. That’s time people get paid vacation/sick year! remember day really started set me. NBA cancelled knew rough times. certification exam next day studying (that later got cancelled), moreso freaking frantically making plans head home stay parents (they're high risk group), isolate them, maximize chances survive get spend time didn't. deadly terrified might've already caught I'd bring home them. Luckily, survived far! Still staying them, mutually beneficial us, ex-roomates turned social distancing threw lots parties. literally differenc ein requirements Medical employees vs ass sitting cubical making cold calls. 


I 100% cant wait watch every business tries force get sued lose.  Sitka small get like 1,000,000 cruise ship tourists normal times makes sense someone pulling weight getting work done, someone problems getting work done home really waste everyone's time resources. call believing conspiracy theories much wondering issues vaccines rushed.

There tried true anti-vaxxers many doctors know little apprehensive. time consuming chief bottleneck Uk vaccine rollout.

Funny read like considering UK's rollout still considered one fast rollouts currently. Oh believe me, unbearably grateful! little baby. March 1st moved would minutes away office. Mistakes made. Sputnik V similar AZ vaccine? know. Anchorage pretty big still, call city might village parts world. Sitka 9000 people call large village. maybe calculate whole area? know lot census. forcing unvaccinated people work home? sounds like win-win me. Why? vaccine keeps safe already. would cause social segregation actually implemented law, mention infringe human rights.   You’re asking exception. vaccines, need every able person part. children many adults cannot get vaccine. It’s something whole get benefit whole. You’re asking reap benefits without part — asking everybody else protect can...stay protected due actions, willfully staying dangerous yourself? Again, something like this, act one, don’t look loopholes ask exception. Because, behavior, extrapolated nationally, nullifies effect life-changingly amazing vaccines. Haha agree I’m downvoting anyways Reddit go brrrrr really following logic here. one hand it’s well within right company mandate employees receive vaccines. everyone feels risk gets one don’t feel risk not, point restricting unvaccinated people going office? worst case scenario, unvaccinated person manages catch COVID transmits someone vaccinated. you’re vaccinated there’s essentially chance develop serious life threatening symptoms. really think there’s much hysteria going around people need relax step back appreciate far we’ve come vaccines. policy seems simple: get vaccinated feel risk serious health complications disease. group? soon full FDA approval going head down? fda said it’s safe that’s approved early, president said it’s safe, president United States gotten vaccine! Doctors says it’s safe. Everyone says it’s safe. Anyone saying waiting full authorization making excuse. month get since it’ll fully approved. that’s great news them. talking LPN’s vs. RN’s. RN’s required least one college degree longer educational path LPN’s. Nah, announced rather early Halix would produce vaccine rather purely provide fill finish hang multiple households sans masks distancing that's also explicitly discouraged CDC year meaningful change open recommendations. federal government also little say whether large, public events go forward. I'd willing bet states allow outdoor crowded events like fireworks show come July. posted comment person responded neglected include part new guidance. poll 1000 cherry picked folks.

No one supports this. can’t even begin fathom closed minded takes genuinely believe that. Holy shit. Like actually can’t connect feel bad you. true actually, measured January 2021. Variants identified fall 2020 started spreading identified. 149,735 individuals documented positive PCR test March 2020 January 2021, 154 two positive PCR tests least 100 days apart, reflecting reinfection proportion 1 per 1000. Given strict inclusion criteria, believe numbers represent true reinfection incidence MHS clinically regarded happy getting vaccine. Whinging complain. Sounds like ""win-jing"" That's nice, absolutely meaningless state vaccines give. See comment. classes addition pharmacology, pathophysiology, anatomy/physiology, microbiology, biology, biochem, chemistry. can’t believe people thread seriously pretending nurses aren’t required educated science. Workers allowed continue work home that's effective. like idea fewer people wasting time commuting. want know mandate something available everybody punish people thing can't get. Thank you. sane comment here. It’s amazing eagerly people beg daddy state authoritarianism. dude, still dumbest shit. It’s like choosing cancer measles saying “man feel like doctors don’t warn bad measles I’m gonna go risk cancer” Dang essential employees really got fucked again. privileged unemployment people keep getting goodies smh Things like trust narratives. question - vaccinated, what’s harm allowing unvaccinated people exist amongst general population?

Vaccines 100% effective. larger unvaccinated population, likely communicable disease continue propogate present danger set people vaccinated (but vaccine result immunity) set people cannot vaccinated, either religious medical reason can't vaccinated or, case COVID vaccines, they're age 16 none vaccines authorized kids age even emergency capacity. 

Additionally, larger unvaccinated population means virus greater chance mutating, may render existing vaccines ineffective. That’s birthday! lot businesses/managers like control able visually keep tabs day.  home state Pennsylvania total shit show.

It's bad, 20% people Pennsylvania given least one would get today. I’m arguing wait full approval. arguing it’s entirely reasonable position, personally yes know people that.

What find harrowing use word “excuse” desire wait FDA approved vaccine. unironically anti-science. claim religion youre set. vaccines essentially 100% effective hospitalization death. Covid solved problem (thanks science industry, thanks lockdowns). vaccinated, people safe able believably play victim anymore. Project much. I'm angry I'm calling bullshit someone pedaling it.
 job disprove bullshit. Haha true Climate change fixing comes telling China stop polluting Earth, everyday person changing things I'm aware one state ""at will"" firing state, perhaps people state might case, courts upheld exceptions comes public safety health. seem glossed little details response. Yes guys jokes, yeah, return mask-free unrestricted travel life end 2023. see Brazil, corona variants far deadlier original one cropping everywhere, soon grow immune vaccines.

Let us clear—this over, indeed barely begun! Ok? He's saying can't anything July 4. still first major holiday we're going things back normal that's discussed. means host get together want. Even following guidelines many us weekend. still can't. July 4 everyone can. That's point. bring much needed mental levity reduce anxiety. 🙂 still spread virus getting vaccinated, still kill grandma. 

1: kind are, care people share delusional world view.

2: get vaccine want it, one risking anything unvaccinated person. really going wear mask rest life live fear? Youre genius Okay want make sure you’re clear asked clear question. saying ***ZERO*** people waiting FDA mandated 6 month follow pass, full approval, gladly take fully approved vaccine. one. Nada. Zero. EVERYONE says going come different reason. head, subset people find logical wait full approval take unapproved vaccine, simply exist. aren’t real. That’s referring patients treated monoclonal antibodies convalescent plasma within past 90 days. contraindicated. control data page consumption habits. That's different WalMart access medical records determine shop there. agree sounds fantastic. example, company work located downtown area major city contractually obligated space like 4 5 years. They've already commented sounds kind like want go back working office revaluate time comes ridiculous everyone forgotten easily work done remotely. think would chip shoulder? choose travel, choose Dubai. happen notice one, everyone traveled there, felt need make pointless comment telling everyone went there. would let go, got shitty people disagreed. Hey I'm perfectly happy debate politics, cast eye right hand side subreddit. Politics expressly forbidden. 

I agree Dubai's human rights record beyond abysmal. I'm saying coronavirus group expressly forbids political talk probably best forum discuss that. Actually Biden talking small party close family friends could well thing current guidelines. Lol cities “A majority - 62% - said unvaccinated people allowed travel airplanes”

Yup, expected: it’s 60/40 political
Divide. OOTL - Who's second? no, selfish fault. us actually decent human beings. number sadly smaller previously thought.

as teenager, one person throwing tantrum internet want whatever please making simple argument decisions based reason. thinking teenager would better describe former latter. allowed disclose hospital's numbers, get official reports assure physician compliance vaccination head shoulders pretty much part healthcare system. course, read explanation note I'm _not_ saying current vaccines safe approved. I'm saying understand people hesitant. Lol, yet people sub clamored lockdowns, majority population suffer (losing livelihoods, forced isolation, exacerbated mental illness) people risk Awesome, thank you! banned export would swim vaccines. Fucking idiots. That's true shared news office. ;)   first child January 2020. quickly realized server postpartum anxiety. Needless say got way worse March 2020. started therapy April 2020, I'm much better. feel sad times still get year thought would son's infancy. many missed opportunities outings. many friends relatives even met yet. Variants doubt this? tons countries right death rate per capita lower death rate would US 100 people day dying COVID. Also, COVID, 100 people died day flu per year. That's think getting 100 deaths day reasonable goal. freedom speech still prevent misinformation.

like say like person also say person child molestor something obviously slander seems Europe, reporting context AZ vaccine officially become sport. don’t right! One team thirty. masks still required. Agreed here. I've recently worked client forced calls late night, hell girlfriend can't cook anything since I'm important work calls. 

Having ability office would solve problem. I'm fine work life balance little whack sometimes, intrudes someone else's life, problem me. 

I can't wait get back office environment able leave come home. ever hit timeline? words Coca Cola Company: evidence coca cola unhealthy brother started ranting coronavirus January 2020. ignored first month could see for. prepared least three months anticipated 18 24 months. 

We fortunate able stay whole time. pleasantly surprised able get vaccine quickly did. Working remotely schooling remotely tough glad ability so. 

I worry long term effects 6 year old son. lost uncle coronavirus January became real him. reminded grandmother age depression shaped rest life. bad anxiety something hope fade time. honestly.. swear get cold every time take flight somewhere Pretty much, can't get covid care. problem anymore. 

People selfish, wow shocking revelation! We've got philosopher everyone. give shit whatever tiny chance spreading covid vaccination, CDC motivated lie chance anyway moment.

You nearly intelligent think are, sound like teenager discovered ""how world works"" 

You must love house, sounds like youll summer!

BTW I'm glad people like tinier fraction society passing day. covid self righteousness gross. Bunch babies made Every shot AZ money lost many people think controversial all. Nursing obviously extremely important, pathway get require much science-wise sitting classroom passing exams typically easier honors-level high school biology course.

The education also extraordinarily variable. RNs vs. BSNs, online vs. ""Ivy League"" programs, etc...

This also people get arms NPs gaining independent practice rights. extremely variable. Maybe NP went Penn Nursing, worked 10 years, went back NP Penn, worked largely independently supervision physician another 10 years. maybe NP ""Jan"" got BSN anywhere let online NP program decent path easy money.

Fact is, nursing variable, standards particularly high we're talking scientific prowess making life/death decisions people health. That’s fucking dumb idea. Smh. That’ll work  company says product good AZ great job changing discussion AZ vs Europe Europe vs US. seems like first smart PR move made.

Lots lives spared this. rest world follow Italy’s example? Yes, either vaccines submitted approval (the Russian one already process) vaccine certificates won’t matter much long run. Good points thinking rationally. bring ego it. European Union’s fight Covid-19 stuck midwinter, even spring vaccinations spur hope improvement U.S. U.K.

Contagion rising much EU, despite months restrictions daily life, more-virulent virus strains outpace vaccinations. mood gloom frustration settling continent, governments caught promises progress bleak epidemiological reality.

Virus infections deaths falling rapidly U.S. U.K. since January inoculations take among elderly vulnerable groups. EU, however, new Covid-19 cases rising since mid-February. U.S. infections deaths, higher per-capita basis 2020, fallen bloc’s.

In much continent, spread more-aggressive variant first detected U.K. behind worsening pandemic, undoing strenuous efforts rein virus since fall array restrictions brought bloc’s economic recovery standstill.

our ancestors gotten too. better brains Letting virus spread could lead mutations potentially render vaccines already vaccinated useless, sending us back square one. can’t believe one catch downvotes makes health concerns people problem.  severe anxiety (which treatment for) severe needle phobia. bad age 31, still lobes ears pierced tattoos.

I avoid almost medical care I'm absolutely terrified they're going force getting shots. I’m vaccine I’m stripping away people’s livelihoods. certain threshold population vaccinated believe go away. don’t believe taking rights away individual answer. alcohol That’s extremely high efficacy, similar measles vaccine. Last Easter thought could 5% CFR hospitals overflowing.

Not quite now. sharing simple stoic principle user help cope anxiety worries. seems like slimy Washington politics Emergent bad job manufacturing vaccines. 😆 could tens millions people US refuse get vaccinated, optimal, would *never* result immunonaïve population. anti-vaxxers never contracted SARS-CoV-2 form colony keep people out, would constitute immunonaïve population, think likely happen, I'm going worried do.

How supposed scientific source long-term efficacy vaccine tested less year? I've dabbled immunology, vaccine efficacy drops cliff point practically unheard of. find plenty immunologists tell vaccine protection temporally finite, I'm sure finding ones convinced we'll need re-vaccinate less year good general protection.

We'll eradicate SARS-CoV-2 anytime soon, suddenly re-become threat year ago. take vaccine soon I'm provided one, also want return office.

I wonder long tell employer allow continue arrangement. Texas expecting sold home opener. Saying hello/goodbye everyone come large group. probably wasted couple hours work day. days even someone feels like chatting. Sounds like projection me, given left half. Aren’t care home staff younger healthier residents though? 

I wasn’t trying make light situation. headline sounded like someone trying find bad thing appears otherwise amazing vaccination effort UK Deaths bit whole thing completely exaggerated. cause death rates bit, still around around 20 years ago. data Scotland regarding AZ  Saying something religion isn’t sort magic shield prevents businesses turning away customer. I’m sure many people attempted masks (they’ve also attempted saying medical conditions preventing wearing mask). doesn’t work. don’t know actual specifics it, imagine business decided wanted deny patronage despite claim vaccines religion, you’ll probably resort suing them. That’s going difficult. many completely legitimate reasons implementing enforcement, you’re also going need prove court actual legitimate belief religion. likely going hard establish don’t belong religion doesn’t allow vaccines. court going closely scrutinize someone claiming religious exemption vaccine; want legitimately protect expression religion, going tolerate someone using legal system cudgel don’t want follow perfectly reasonable legitimate rules.

And even then, still probably legal. Schools (public private) required proof vaccination long time. There’s strong public health policy allow businesses continue enforce requirements.

In general, businesses allowed discriminate whatever way want; actually types discrimination illegal (protected classes). mention millions immunity prior infection. Maybe could fucking jobs come standardized vaccine passport even update yellow card system. international travel bit factor. worst case scenario, unvaccinated person manages catch COVID transmits someone vaccinated. you’re vaccinated there’s essentially chance develop serious life threatening symptoms.

The worst case scenario unvaccinated people allowing virus spread mutate making vaccinations rest population potentially useless. love wearing mask sad day comes they’re socially acceptable anymore. wear masks follow rules regulations despise (it ""just piece cloth"" many people. moment Fauci &amp; CDC state announce met threshold they've laid pull back wearing masks (currently suggesting 10k cases day less, subject change) majority population vaccinated, stop wearing mine. enraged others wearing masks, fully support people whatever feel necessary - mandated masks continued sign something wrong - may seem cliche cure can't worse disease. can't expect protect every illness ever live lives constant state caution. Like said, individually everyone feel best themselves, mandates blanketed mask social distance rules cannot go forever, government CDC telling us - won't. patient assholes lift restrictions soon.

I think would nice considerate people wear masks sick public - would great people stayed home work sick, instead hero going (I guilty this.) Would even amazing federal sick day options. Biden appointed whole team getting done faster got second company make vaccine, no? amount outrage would cause would insane. 

Or people lie. answered question better worded it. comments thread kinda wacky. believe ""global solidarity"". long deliveries schedule, allowed companies export many doses wanted rest world. deliveries fell behind due production issues, get doses back. Meanwhile, US ignored that, took million extra doses sending out, put citizens first, even meant people countries would go without kept doses warehouses sure enough finish job.  America

Who knew Ireland would become worst place live pandemic. That's thought, thanks. certainly judge blame anyone does. I'm going 100% honest, I'm never going wear one voluntarily again. I'm going much likely stay home sick. Yeah US paid lot AZ help development. lag reporting weekend numbers look good beginning week not. Someone please save returning non-remote teaching. Source? I'd look research. advised never anything highest liked comment sub says built office MC, that's team building said RN required one college degree implies 4 year degree, isn’t true.

It implies 4-year degree never heard community college.

Not sure trying hard shit nurses, really hope never need one. Well US hindering production EU blocking exports needed supplies, unfortunately led AZ revising EU forecasts again.

AZ asshole though. They're delivering separate contract separate production facilities. That’s get fired office rite aid website really bad, far tell pure luck get appointment there. safeway one reliable, enter zip radius willing look easily toggle different locations see times available. found one Longview today 4PM, since requires info know even know make 4PM today there's much tell there.

I'm sure saw Cowlitz country covid page links probably useful get updated: text alerts sign covid vaccine, idea well work.

Another useful website: Well least give chance GET vaccine first. state age group back line. I’m Phase 4 green lit Phase 3 like earlier week.

After we’ve chance, let anti-cad crowd bang windows go back lives. That’s happens. need system brings vaccines homes.  get dude, know many people feel way. Like said, I’m higher risk people, doctors getting vaccine. point seems arbitrary, hopefully everyone’s situation gets little better everyone wants one get one.  I'm American postponed Iceland trip 2020 that's currently penciled August. spending travel credit actually book flights yet, keeping fingers crossed safe go. Feeling pretty optimistic right now. EU limits travellers coming lot countries long time. Y’all insane.

**Additional Thoughts/Cool Stuff**

Testing Positivity Rate: said lot subs positivity rate go time people vaccinated require testing. Last year, *the* metric watch, likely wane quickly importance overall testing drops. necessarily worry sudden high positivity rates, mass testing likely drop pretty quickly, particularly testing sites converted vaccination sites. 

We may want use newly found testing sequencing capacity test sequence higher proportion flu samples. might give us head start flu genetics circulating, help eliminate flu two. We're single digits flu cases places, awesome! likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

Unlikely, already it, hey. That’s false despite condition pushes ahead volunteer vaccine clinic.

.....

this dumb. holier-than-thou point. volunteer clinic contact lots people yet, sort moral superiority want retain, want lower risk spreading covid.. lol

lots unvaccinated people chaperone family vaccination sites Thank God work normal people care.   Work nursing. confirm: Nurses far highly educated. technically trade job. nurses pursue higher education, like Nurse Practitioners highly educated.  People put extra effort get vaccine get one early mid April imo. (ie: refresh webpage hour, drive 2 hours get one, etc).

At point mid late April predict transition supply issue demand issue.

That might little bullish going depend lot many people really want take vaccine put effort get it.  sure middle May pick one random. Hooray Martin Van Buren  agree, concerned yet another way divide populace create yet another level society.

I fully support ban vaccination numbers hit point longer issue... what's that.. something like 95% populace? tiny minority sucha small risk, tad hash ban them.

I entirely concept including vaccination passports though. Especially vaccination yet kick last hing need American antivaxxer swaning country clean mess left behind. post this. Thanks saving effort.

6 years nurse training mean smart critical thinking ability. means trained nurse.

Anyone believes stuff smart enough comprehend cell phone tracking. morons stormed Capitol posting lol Also everyone seems pretend new variants can't emerge US... country far infections worldwide.

Yes absolutely pump tons vaccine get whole world vaccinated ASAP, think getting US situation control first top priority US. No, make ambitious goal, fall short close big deal - still making better progress rest world. 

The truth - previous administration done enough make 100/100 realistic goal. current administration done even better job, made 150/100 even 200/100 possible. taking credit previous administration already done bothers people.

edit: BTW - reason able make prediction ""long ago"" unambitious. best comment I've read long time. went Iceland last March (actually got stuck days US travel ban) cannot wait go back. ok? good open up? Handicapped people insane use hyperbole. Yes. ask sign get vaccinated. shitty self centered point view. 

Frankly think hooking everyone actually essential, try deny people didn’t get any. generally point dangerous vaccine history (smallpox) ~40,000x safer catching covid, worked disease 30X deadly.

It acknowledges that, sure, vaccine risk technically zero (that seems point radicalization, vaccines ever nonzero risk despite people saying zero). They'll sight single obscure case disproof claim ""zero risk"".

But comparatively close zero like choosing stand still worried possibility dying tripping hitting head curb someone currently shooting gun you. Yeah live city really followed covid rules pretty strictly many people still wearing masks outside, even many people around. not. walk morning, early, around 7, people, maybe 1 human per city block, almost everybody wearing mask. people dramatically walk around give (waaay enough) space, like they'll walk street. little bizarre. I’m sure karens fitness world would probably fight chance haha. Especially pharmacy, would demand scale asap. posted two-month-old story start variants. Since then, new stories national media said that, yes, they're infectious, places like U.S. high vaccine rates, there's sign they're bad initially feared. still yearly vaccine tens thousands deaths want help, bystander. store restaurant see someone following safety protocol, please say something! Stand service workers, demand fellow consumers what's right.

It takes courage, means world us. vastly overestimating ability desires Democrats. There's reason 2,000 became 1,400, universal healthcare became option wastes hundreds billions year parasitic middle men, $15 minimum wage happening, children still kept subpar facilities deportations break international laws laws still carried round clock despite promises stop them.

Just Republicans bunch inhuman ghouls seem enjoy causing human suffering mean Democrats somehow friends working class, competent united meaningful sense. would like know well.

I bet going harder harder European countries low vaccination rates. Young people people general going see US UK highly vaccinated European countries like Serbia, Hungary, Finland Denmark open up, find harder harder stay cooped vaccination reaches high enough percentage. second dose hits hard lot people. I’d probably skip glad later  RemindMe! 2 months Good thing vaccines effective it. feel better flying everyone’s vaccinated. haven’t plane year. wait vaccines common. actually tried rural area saw politicians making big stink discrepancy supply cities risk people cities doesn’t mean I’d justified shitting people risked themselves. one calling hard shut down. Christ almost one nine months. completely opening full indoor dining large scale events asking deaths, handicapped people, variants. 

Some loosening amongst small groups family gatherings reasonable. Coachella isn’t. I've said start, pandemic decide over. many Americans, decided far soon. Others, particularly reddit, probably far longer necessary. most, point summer cases low nearly everyone know vaccinated.

If keep following news, sub, CDC information, etc... probably live COVID brain next 2-3 years. reason though? cases could discriminatory many reasons like race, gender, retribution. serious risk health safety employees end person refuses take vaccine, think it’s completely fine they’re forced stay home. parents haven’t seen grandkids year?

1) stunning success two mRNA vaccines jolted industry tooling kind vaccine. Sanofi probably wants gain institutional experience developing producing mRNA vaccines virus future viruses, addition current viruses vaccines poor (influenza) vaccines (RSV, perhaps norovirus, others).

2) eight billion people earth current supply inadequate vaccinate timely manner third candidate help.

3) unclear whether boosters and/or variant-covering vaccines needed, Sanofi would like prepared.

4) Work ongoing design vaccines. Already Sanofi projecting -20C storage temperature researching mRNA vaccines would stable refrigerator temperatures (4C).

Anyway sorry rant.... truly. course Harbaugh players wanted play. He's likely referring school administration possibly Athletic Director. somewhere around 200 million Pfizer alone Q2, compared around 65 million Q1. lot 30% (about twice current rate supply though since getting around 30 million month) feel pretty confident getting simile announcement next week so. think DeWine wants mass vaccination sites running smoothly gives go ahead us course. enough states repeatedly botched mitigating spread virus 're-openings' easing indoor gathering restrictions worst times. one heart point recurring errors governance. second 'wave' enough indicator think, ""maybe slightest dip cases mean going away."" especially testing contact tracing never quite reaching critical mass. marginal overlap populations prioritized vaccination states masses resume patronizing establishments (or continue unrestricted travel unconscionable behavior likely never ceased) restrictions lifted prematurely suggests there's light end tunnel now, lookin like bunch brake lights.  argued something say, I'M one creating ""Reddit moments""? 😂 great boss long got work done care did, half office playing minecraft constantly company server Yeah, we're yet. long shot.

You’re spreading anti-vax propaganda probably “correct” people calling bullshit out.  Wait, HCQ actually works applications? thought totally useless hard tell became cultural issue scientific one Personally see low number active cases local area line. enough population vaccinated, able achieve low number active cases likelihood catch spread covid similarly low.

Contrary commenter says everyone going living lives soon vaccinated, see case frankly, quite uneducated way approach issue. Everyone know sense empathy vaccinated still wearing mask social distancing before. 

Once active cases down, certainly beginning see many places, begin return normal social atmosphere. There’s much wrong statement, cannot. 🤦‍♂️ Polls falsified introduce controversial laws sway public opinions matters supported majority. Look presidential polls understand falsehood.

RemindMe! 3 months. I'm 25% convinced ""long COVID"" period people tired messed months misassigning name depression anxiety year-long quarantine entire situation. 

People catch COVID, anxiety goes roof everyone's telling they're going die - surprised experience anxiety-like symptoms alongside normal symptoms COVID - Reddit mild. agree trump good job vaccines biden riding wave. Look shit show europe comparison. WW killed around 75 million people planet 5 billion less people. understand wanting prevent preventable death. small google search. Honeslty doubt will, don’t think there’s huge drive vaccines them, onky cuz it’s usually mild low illness don’t think anyone really form them. fake news ate up. biggest time line issues removed expedited. Normally submit wait line regulators look results. Covid vaccine got skip line. 

As side effects omitted, omitted ones things fell line rate general public. 

If 5% general public develops rash, 5% vaccine group develops rash, assume everything okay.  Well, certainly agree best way combat climate change systemic individual like currently presented. that's world/capitalism problem, single country. Yeah, sure technically, every decision human makes discrimination definition then. discriminate McDonald's drive past buy food Chipotle.

That's people usually mean discrimination common parlance, although maybe indictment imprecisely use word basically mean ""selection way think bad"".  Interesting. son's college Minnesota two three spring break days. expect end semester month early various reasons. dumb. Vaccine even approved FDA yet. absurdly high percentage population might well open everyone point.  healthcare version ""Buy 1 get one free"" ""friend referral""  Maybe reporting 1 late February. think Americans might getting fed idea virus might stick around 40% Americans get shit together. Carrot vs. Stick point. obvious. 100% agree. Yeah it’s trendy move somewhere cheap remote 3 years want new job? “Hmm wel guy Iowa good resume...I dunno, one Brooklyn might better fit NYC based team.” still restricted office even get vaccine? Pretty please??? Something else occurred me. FDA give emergency use authorization vaccines used, vaccines (yet) licensed. Forcing someone get unlicensed drug biologic (vaccine) violation Geneva Convention. Specifically, Convention forbids human experimentation without informed consent. Masks required gatherings, indoor outdoor, everyone offered vaccine. vaccines nothing like vaccine used history world. Show long term effects results mRNA injection human body. many subjects study available vaccine longer six months even? certainly year. data exist yet. Nevermind fact genetically engineered solutions rushed timespan months. Sorry bucko. guinea pig. flu run risk heart lung damage even mild cases? No.

Yes...now shut fuck up. Fucking imbecile. Go basic research.

Can flu cause heart damage?
In addition, flu infection causes inflammatory state body, also trigger heart attacks plaque rupture, mechanism heart attacks associated inflammation. Even young, healthy patients without underlying cardiovascular disease, flu deadly. saw post this. Ohioan gives lots hope us getting also. We've relatively close michigan terms metrics recently, we're getting bunch mass vaccination sites next week. it, may know guy thing. would totally masking airplanes became norm moving forward. way could take it? listed right side side. wanted point differences way perceive threats. mean me, one less threat other. difference main point disagreement two ideologies.

To answer second question, think would support right private company make decisions people wish business with, even don’t agree them. still wouldn’t stop voicing disagreement. still opinions authority matter. evidence vaccines dramatically reduce entirely prevent spread disease. like dramatically reduce entirely prevent catching disease. they? guess know couple weeks. always thought classed low risk miniscule risk based children's ages maybe wrong Exactly right. I’m honestly baffled people seriously think RN based “leadership” “public health” classes? lawyer? assume not, were, would know that’s illegal discrimination law. Choosing get vaccine protected class.  interesting see social norm resets regards mask usage. people don’t like masks wear them, vaccinated don’t want look like assholes wearing masks public places, others don’t care assholes. lot factors play. Florida cases still declining. rights end mine begin.

It's absolutist though. almost always overlap 2 people's rights interact manner, determines rights begin person's right's end, you, community (town/city, state, country) choose live in. impact community factor extremely large degree right's inherently begin person's end, impact responsibility around determined community. source say say does. says countries subject export controls vaccines EU *may* block export company shady fulfilling contractual obligations country exporting from. far happened one order Astra Zeneca delivered ~16 % promised EU, still exporting vaccines manufacture across world issues US UK. *once*.

Also see Britain exempted border control, shown nothing bad faith vaccine de facto contractual export ban turning around blaming EU. least, would like mixed setups go 2-3 days week. we're point 100+ random people gather indoors together there's need mask mandate. city sent vaccine registration URL's qualifying citizens. However, links single-use, anyone gets link forward whoever like, recipients sign without asked preexisting medical conditions. unless someone up-to-date city's current phases, may see opportunity get vaccinated take it, completely honest. gave range reason vaccines effective right now, useful extend math across dimension vaccine effectiveness, opt-out rate.

And yet cited value vaccine even approved US. approved vaccines much higher efficacy rates. seems pretty dishonest risk others medical reasons moral justification forced medical procedures. There's reason stopped forcing lobectomies mentally ill.

Are seriously comparing lobotomy vaccine significant side-effects, tested 5 months, receive full approval next month, given _millions upon millions_ people safely?

As forcing get it- to- mean go work them. children get vaccines go school adults go That's false dichotomy. many reasons people may want skip jab. example, already contracted virus, allergies ingredients, autoimmune disease could exacerbated it, maybe want contract virus old fashioned way.

If seriously believe anyone suggesting someone allergy ingredients auto-immune disease required get vaccine again- wildly dishonest.

Having already contracted vaccine guarantee immunity variants even then- people would perfectly comfortable allowing someone existing antibodies skip mean bend break moral fiber force compliance institutions.

Our moral fiber? hell even mean? live society rules lot rules protect fellow citizens.

For example- would feel way smallpox made comeback? 2 hours post vaccine #2 moderna. Arm's getting sore expected Damn, that’s good past three months turned fucking Euroskeptic!  Oh, guess one get vaccine? run around say fuck it? fuck actual point here? what’s stop people choose get vaccinated finding doctors happy write “you medical reason” note, like see anti-vaxx parents now?  coworker get vaccine friend got like virus.
Almost like that's vaccines work. Trust me, random guy reddit, this. UK properly locked since January.

The US never really locked ever.

So course UK fully open then. want vaccine, also want continue working home


I'm gonna quit make go back office, fuck them. Person parents vaccinated. Problem solved. think type people know RL anti-vaxxers, common sense. one wants around people, even without risk disease death. That's illegal discrimination. Really, said. Ankle bracelet?

All said, nobody wears mask outside it’s never law unlike countries/states. It’s funny see videos U.K. get shared r/publicfreakout people like “WHERE MASK THO?” Let's see dating apps filter vaccinated folks, along verification it.

""Swipe me, I've got shots!"" agree everything except appeal authority. Pharmaceutical companies earned bit skepticism. 

I applied that, determined I'd idiot get vaccinated, got vaccinated. 

I'm excusing conclusions draw, saying skepticism much justified given past conduct pharmaceutical companies.  isn’t accusations. It’s pointing people unvaccinated spread disease much higher rate vaccinated. people unvaccinated, cases, immune compromised people can’t get vaccinated poor response vaccination risk. 

The best way protect people everybody get vaccinated can. raises specter whether people chose get vaccinated allowed activities choose vaccinated, since activities likely lead outbreak unvaccinated people involved. last week, average 2.23 million vaccines administered. Even US stays pace, Memorial Day, that's 73 million people vaccinated, including shots Johnson Johnson. top 33 million already fully vaccinated. top 31 million gonna get second shot. 

That's half country. half adults. that's current pace. matter people get ""fooled"" not, summer 2021 going shut meaningful way.  immune-compromised populations?

Luckily, wife missed period weeks later pregnant! incredibly happy.

The next day, Mike DeWine announced shutdowns. work already declared mandatory work-from-home point, wife teacher. ""No big deal,"" thought. ""It's bug 99+% survival rate. shutdown month squash pregnancy stuff summer fall, complete totally normal birth."" Lockdown going easy, short.

Then birthday came April, pandemic still raging on. point accepted life going suck vaccine came out. summer hit awful things came along it: murder George Floyd led BLM movements, increasing amount political rallies held Shall Named, vitriol social media anti-science talk, even going Kroger felt like death trap people handling it. 2020 increasingly becoming dumpster fire.

We could still things, right? ""babymoon"" immediate family making pact would get tested coming back, quarantining beforehand. socially distant gender reveal baby shower. kept hangouts friends either less five people Discord. Though ""last hurrahs"" venturing parenthood, could. could always go hard next year.

On November 19 gave birth daughter, Sophia. wife crushed 26-hour labor pushing hour half. Right away things looking up. eating, pooping, wiggling around. Unfortunately, breathing quick, nurses took back Special Care Unit, promise precaution nothing serious appeared happening.

Then days went by.

Then week.

Then Day 10, breathing spiked 180 breaths/minute. Clearly people something giving antibiotics hoping goes away. advanced diagnostics, labs, nothing. Finally made call transfer Cincinnati Children's got best care planet.

I knew ventilator scary thing much talked course year, beyond scared came seeing even two week old daughter survive one. everything right. put meds, monitored times, upped decreased oxygen flow things got better, wife kept pumping breastmilk feed her. stayed long feasible mental health. fact, stayed first hospital week room could well passed morgue. Doctors told us go home could lighten spirits.

Oh. visitors. all. Whatsoever. see lives complete misery several weeks able lay feelings support circle except FaceTime.

Finally, Day 21 life, discharged. outpatient meds miracle. still never able figure cause believe infection. However, ventilator week, needs feeding tube adventure own. finally getting hang swallowing whole meal's worth milk one go, hope finally rely machines survival first time life by, know, end next week? We've moving goalposts lot here, end day does.

Last year taught resilient, stay know, stay calm. thrown window stuff daughter happening. point, learned people's true natures dropped several toxic people social media. arguments, callouts, explanations. gone. feeds shorter I'm stressed anymore.

My work gave opportunity get vaccinated January, when, shockingly, significant percentage hospital doctors nurses opted out. took offer, time hundreds thousands cases per day, could longer rely fellow American keep family safe deadly virus. wife got vaccinated February, sisters. parents got vaccinated weeks ago. in-laws got well. one get one little sister's husband he's healthy profession lets get sooner (like me, basically giftwrapped shot early). Easter *on* year almost us protected we'll get feeding tube daughter go start normal, functioning 4-month old. summer *on* see friends regular basis. 

Life going *on* later year. We're close finish line. Keep fighting good fight been. Get shot first able to. got this. anti-vax propaganda.

They lie effectiveness vaccines lead fewer people wanting take them. Wow. deliberately sue right endanger others?! Except, that’s they’re saying... 

You also believe it’s “bullshit,” clearly don’t. 

Zero Catholic friends getting vaccine this. Doesn’t mean can’t conscious vaccine made, contradicts beliefs. 

Nothing wrong making conscious effort avoid abortions... Look bright side: worst year life probably behind you. know headlines might taking contacts sometimes feel like guy place predictions. really think that's going happen, even CDC still recommends it. People accept hospitals minimally full deaths way down. Eventually state reach Texas moment say fuck it. expect everything fully back normal July Supplies cost. past days, hit record daily number testing. cost test kit 60 bucks, they're currently 120,000 tests per day. 66% *spectacular*, especially combined near 100% reduction severe cases. means really unlikely get sick, even extremely unlikely last long produce high viral load.

When comes relaxation, 99% want indoors. Even year this, still find desiring sit couch, read, watch TV, play games, work home gym. blue moon I'll feel itch go out, get dinner, visit friends, rare. 

But comes work? Oh GOD hate work home. always thought I'd ok it, stinks. Even though work desk job, home killing compared office building. March lemmings  hated every minute it. start things back capacity amazing still anyone else’s personal behavior relevant whether Fauci believes people waiting pins &amp; needles suggestions?

Of course don’t know kind “got ya” point you’re trying make that. I’m really sure relevant. shouldn’t different piles first dose second dose vaccines. fewer people getting second doses, giving first doses instead. Keep mind too, SA study conducted relatively small denominator causing wide confidence interval standard deviation. 

Also, inclusion immunocompromised partipants adds numerous layers uncertainty.  Im confused isnt removed mods purely political adds nothing discussion. need try peer pressure impling I'm idiotic. want get vaccinated. want get good vaccine distance everything lost friends dad, I'd like certain I'm keeping others safe. I'm ok waiting bit longer get that. Also breakthrough biotech MRNA vaccines, seems best suited variants. 
I also hope acceptance push less effective vaccine capitalist plot ensure profits future booster vaccines. I'm stuck house lots time think research.
I think valid question. AstraZeneca knows export bans. promised Australia doses export license EU, first promising EU doses US, even know it’s possible obtain doses. Australia blamed EU probably EU blame US. would gladly say fuckers trying get people get vaccine end pandemic bullshit  It’s week “distributed” actually arriving vax sites. Distributed like online retailer tells product shipped, create airway bill.

Doses take around 2-3 days average going arms reported CDC. There’s closer 8-10 days lag right two numbers even counting time arrival shots arms. J J something like 66 percent effective overall, especially great goal spread it? well (except fever). went away 48 hour mark got 2nd dose. No, like opposite actually. younger people stronger immune systems generally get worse side effects, older people tend get fewer side effects. overall, there’s inverse correlation risk Covid vaccine reactivity. that’s interesting population level correlation, really don’t think individual conclude anything response Covid would based response vaccine. uni hawley attended, coincidence?  week stressful really one bomb another.

I'll copy-paste already asked somewhere else:

Cut today, log Reddit get home work, time 6:03PM, top feed ""more mass vaccination appointments opening today 6PM"".

So anyways March 20th/April 10th Pfizer, lucked way vaccine. everyone irresponsible. parents instance road tripping north 2 days see grandkids Can't get screwed bad contract never sign one. _4head_ Last 4th July saw huge ass parties. Pretty sure 4th gonna fucking lit year. never know. says teachers vaccinated weekend bunch states flipped, including ours. makes announcement states follow, won’t, know nobody wants look bad. introvert always enjoyed ""me time."" experience, expect bit active accepting invitations seeking opportunities gather others. Thankfully, majority high risk folks hospitalized dying Covid already vaccinated, joining every day. Cases likely going get young people letting guard down, two metrics actually matter, hospitalizations deaths, continuing continue drop high risk folks vaccinated. Yeeee need administration bump Mass booked way April keep hearing surge vaccine coming.

I wonder that's vaccine that's still marked delivery CDC part 32million CDC marked delivered yet administered. Considering seem satisfied lower protection swayed increased protection, two remaining arguments are:

1. Immunity first shot may fade time, booster makes sure immunity lasts long possible. get second shot now, immunity may fade may end take second shot later road anyway!
2. may activities future require proof *fully* vaccinated - sporting events, travel, etc. single dose cut that. never solidarity. self-interest which, brief period history, happened align.

Now diverging, EU's days numbered. knows that, he's ""cool guy"" (not trying get auto-deleted) read article?

""Thankfully, recent updates child tax credit won’t require make changes 2020 tax return. Eligibility simply based 2019 2020 tax return information, depending filed.""

It also specifically states PREPAYMENT 2021 taxes. Probably they're making absolutely sure get screwed cuntish company happened AZ.

Also, Novavax planning doses even UK Q3, would little help anyway. Curevac probably come them. worries, think we're high alert due amount active vaccine disinformation there. Lot's companies used 4 10s decades ago reason got away it. Man, competency leadership. would thought. I’m suddenly shit 

Have constipated past year?  member states hording refusing use them, member states wanting none.

EU solidarity finest.  True. I’d imagine Biden working administration bit well I’m surprised 2020 unemployment tax waiver discussed more. That’s HUGE. I’ll go owing taxes getting refund. Glad haven’t filed yet. Yes do. W4.  HR always knows. Fair enough. hyperbolic. so? aspect precautions affecting most? mention single parents. Dependents affect much money get, cutoff. couple making 148,000 year Arkansas gets whole payout, single mom 4 kids making 113,000 NYC. promise one people much better other.

A lot programs assistance take family size account. weird didn't.  66% better flu vaccine, ever considered getting one figure covid vaccine would important community almost order magnitude (slight percentage ""better"" vaccine"" prevent roughly 10x worse virus) Home office home-based worksite two different things OSHA. One inspect, one receive complaint. Source: read directive. Yep! I'm going numbers estimate lol. Illinois going getting 100k J&amp;J doses daily ""by mid-March"", well track fully vaccinated Given track record...I’ll believe see it. Summer going jail break. Even standing parking lot picking kid school number people showing without masks taking moment hit sidewalk rising quickly. aside, Novavax seems fantastic, EU sitting deal since December, Novavax us. Gonna fun summer pans also hot humid year though may official, seems pretty likely hot humid climate helps reduce spread saw summer (though that's true indoors especially air conditioner on). California warm hot dryer spikes happened following major holidays people big parties. There’s 94% chance even someone covid coughed face would get sick able spread virus, 97% chance wouldn’t symptoms it. Yes.  non-MRNA vaccines, probably one best terms with.  came agreement early, big agreement, paid front get stockpile doses us prior us approving it. 52 million ordered option 24 25 million more.

And non-mRNA vaccines, one also looks far best, least arsenal.  also going produce NovaVax later year, could key variants. neighbors last year, socially distant. Let’s see I’m generally big government telling small government run states one times.


However say states weren’t already trajectory meet this? WTF doing? Smoking weed something? tax preparer specifically requested wait file 2020 return changes including CTC effect 2020 return. Dope He’s sandbagging people don’t start acting irresponsible now. That's sad. I'm glad guys made it, though! awesome. 

My guess april opened up, depending state, need administration ramped massively. 

My guess many people still getting first doses late may based current ramp. I'm totally this, except I've eligible vaccine 3 months due occupation, one it. fine dandy make eligible, find way actually get people. can't read hebrew : yes, that's southpark episode true cinephile. He’s sandbagging. go go know, I’m happy sore arm &amp; headache first dose. least know got damn thing! promise deliver idea happens? Can't wait see Dead co start touring 💀🌹  we've heard far, yeah, supply limiting factor Great hear. many people going refuse vaccinate get rid covid altogether need tools like deal inevitable future outbreaks. School employees childcare staff part 1B. part Virginia, started getting vaccine late January.  still 110k people 65 16-64 waiting list county. VDH allocating around 20k doses/week county. regions Virginia excess supply, VDH likely increase allocation significantly. That's great reassuring really need way show per capita numbers.

Israel, UK USA 3 countries I've watching. It'll interesting see going forward. Again, I'm calling flu, I'm saying realistic experience MAJORITY virus, believe dangerous is.

This done protect every single person dying covid, Healthcare system would collapse. That's reasonable standard everyone understand. understand 30 healthy I'm extremely unlikely get sick, get spread someone can, thus contributing overall strain hospitals.

We rapidly approaching situation that's longer concern. Hospitals pretty good shape vaccine stops serious disease. seeing people saying need keep distancing mitigation people vaccinated they're using argument people may still able get disease get sick/let morph variants. Well that's need realistic expectations calling disease people: feels like bad flu.

We need wanting distancing masking continue need reassess expectations here.

If going get sick want vaccine vaccinated...why mitigating? point personal societal costs mitigation outweigh cost virus. Also going around acting like death sentence 40 blatantly incorrect, people that, loose credibility. There’s already bar crawl weekend live. Michigan loves party small town’s downtown social district. summer going WILD. J&amp;J 

What actual projected J&amp;J numbers? seem production issues. Holy fuck. hard date. Something actually look forward year nebulous insanity.  constant negativity turning people off, that's why. government shouting rooftops vaccines get us hell out. this, ""get shot nothing changes bull.""  ""ya 4th gon lit"" - Biden, weeks probably Can't wait play [Crab settles down. why? better expect nothing expect moon stars Well I'm liar bullshitting. Think will. live next door orthodox jewish family, like many peers go huge social gatherings without care world. mother, father, one kids got covid twice . Tested time. Confirmed. know happen. understand states everything right? Trump hand that. left everything COVID states provided federal assistance. even bungled something easy stimulus payments even though he's ""deal maker"" focused looking good press conferences stopping immigration Moving US smart move, Europe I'd waited til late summer least. ...definitely not. live can’t even sit coffee shop? following around responding comments fun? mention Pfizer pretty much built BioNTech's entire infectious disease arm last four years. BioNTech CANCER vaccine company entered infectious disease space Pfizer funded University Pennsylvania professors ran it. You’re correct- anyone may boat: filed online, use software file amendment — known Form 1040-X. worked professional, follow make sure form submitted accurately time.   get people going call dude’s comments doom glooming, blah blah blah. 

But tbh, don’t *need* everything 100%, completely normal. 

I want able go restaurants, hang party, go baseball game, see at-risk family members without stress etc.

If means wearing mask stadium, fine. means wearing mask theater, whatever. rapid covid test airport? Fine. 

Acting 100% like pre-covid would weird. 

We lifetime pandemic. literal world-changing event killed *millions*. 

What actually perfectly normal things changed slightly that. US uptake percentage likely autumn?  Honestly I'm keeping track cases locally. Mid-Fall October.

I'm mostly wary variants such. still go stores such, I'm complete hermit. Also live state they've completely lifted mask restrictions allowed everything open 100% (thankfully people around giving in), I'm also trying careful too. Especially outside. entire year, even including maskless gatherings, believe I've seen exactly *one* documented instance transmission outdoors. 119,095,926 detected cases today, knows many undetected ones.  Yes, think that's generally frowned on, really hit miss. Many pharmacies wait lists get snippy people ask (they call people appointments next day ask want come now.) 

There sites usually extras standby, one day defrosted 100 extras mistake, jackpot everyone group hopes for. does, race over. sent husband one heard online, get fast enough.

The particular site that's big LA takes leftover vaccines multiple sites really mission give leftovers, screen line pull older people, people health problems, frontline workers locals first. perfect. new date they'll set offer vaccine everyone.

Oct 2021. Q2 another lost quarter. forced order able go domestic activities participate society, would support it?

No, never said would. Though belive still take precautions chance spread virus. Almost certainly true. jawed vertebrate adaptive immune system pretty amazing thing basically keeps library every antibody-producing cell ever made. reactivated many years. brief answer internet forum refer in-depth texts immunology like. Yeah phrasing CNN alert got phone -- ""...a step he'll say could allow small July 4th gatherings.""

Could? small gatherings?? TWO MONTHS LATER??

If anyone wants vaccine get one TWO WHOLE MONTHS people power still trying keep restrictions place, they're gonna see literal rebellion I'll part it. lethality thing knocked out, especially everyone get vaccinated, I'm done. I've given much ugly cry think much. I'm fucking done fear-mongering media trying get sacrifice even more. Yes, quickly gone describe. tasted faintly microchips.  Likely would need file amended return. big deal. severe shortage SF Bay Area, one. I've eligible since February 22, able get first dose yesterday.

When opens everyone May 1, going see even worse backlog.  virus dying no. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! No, issue EU ordering earlier letting AZ sort production problems rollout started earnest like UK. comment history joke. getting vote dumbest 12 year old Reddit. wife hopeful international travel restrictions get relaxed late September/October. wonder helps make reality. Granted idea situation EU is. no. really slower? We’re talking % points top field California. North Dakota top 87.3% total 280,757 shots given California 72.3% total 11,062,505 shots given. aren’t even playing game. It’s different animal, compare % points. It’s like comparing stats little league team stats MLB team, don’t compare. 

Sure, ND used 15% allocation up, California given nearly many shots arms one day ND since vaccines started.  matter quarter we're get impatient allow virus bounce back. Always under-promise over-deliver. uptake horrible? Or, unlikely, possible, new variant actual implicated vaccine escape crops up?

Neither things likely happen, long there's slim chance everything going shit, they're right conservative, over-promise under-deliver, people going streets it. Europeans offspring chicken emigrate US. get mad US EU job. Also act like care honestly. feel like capacity double pace, volunteer? curious see really possible whether vaccine supplies always limiting factor. yeah i'm surprised, see time makes blood boil need lockdown completely eradicate virus. frustrating countries Europe stealing AZ vaccines stopping people taking. south carolina open months. where’s variant? I've read online there's bit rut vaccination due lack supply. keep us posted I'm curious too!  sentiment still exists happened daily discussion page week.  yeah always said last 10 days going slower there'd surge afterwards, fingers crossed. Thanks! Seriously hope enjoy watching doomsday news making shitty sourdough bread. adult? 18? 21?  Lol, explain benefits whatever, there's ""we"" ""you"".

Yes, banning vaccine exports countries exporting vaccines makes US look bad world stage. I'm sorry. personal opinion irrelevant respect geopolitical consequences this. He's cautious. Go small later versus downsizing something goes wrong (not will- possible) You’ve seen two times year since you’ve dating? Damn, that’s intense. recent research immune escape, probably even contagious (and presumably therefore severe) B.1.1.7.

I would say either statements anywhere near certain (p&lt;.05). AstraZeneca selected would influence UK government.

Valneva, Novavax CureVac will also producing vaccines UK, exchange UK assistance.

The reason UK keen domestic production partly EU27 countries blocked exports PPE UK ordered NHS paid last year - leading people dying - wanted avoid vulnerable again. Thank heavens. Glad see legislature passed actual help 99% country once. 

It's helpful completely ignoring reality. many bills passed help. one matters passed *your* party.

You're part problem. Proof? far I'm aware, none found, no. typically younger people seem react vaccine severely older, inverse would expect infection. 95 percent infected patients examined, Hungarian laboratory already detects British variant
MARCH 10, 2021
In 95 percent tested positive samples, British variant found Hungary recently, diagnostic laboratory Neumann Labs said based “The nucleic acid-based PCR test capable detecting infections amazing efficiency, also effective method measuring viral load. words, shows someone infected, also many viruses presumably body. 3,000 tests recently performed, 95 percent positive samples already identified British variant, what’s even frightening measured far viruses samples, average 15 times many viruses before, first case second-wave Wuhan virus infections - said Miklós Nyíri, managing director Neumann According Neumann Labs, severity explained fact amount virus patients may proportional severity disease, suggesting people, including young people, hospitalized third wave less protected higher viruses. also thought conceivable variant much contagious “patients simply produce virus pass easily. Unfortunately, also quite clear mutation become dominant, 95% infections detected country linked British mutant, found cases South Africa, ”the executive company conducting tests since outbreak began last spring. far, completed total 200,000 tests, recent weeks, proportion positive cases tests performed approached 20 percent. Apologies asked billion times. anywhere near amount data regarding transmission, blocking asymptomatic infection etc. Moderna JJ Pfizer? 


My health anxiety fucking bitch really want sitting around months extra making sure get Pfizer, that's probably exactly stupid brain going me. filed last week. Curious impacts me? Lol Completely anecdotal, people know personally vaccine, younger healthier ones gotten annoying &amp; worse side-effects (fairly bad fatigue, nausea, etc. 16-24 hours) elderly people felt fewer, lesser side-effects.

I idea pattern generalized coincidence people know. larger pattern, layperson's wild guess first hypothesis would younger people stronger immune systems usually efficient &amp; successful fighting actual Covid, ramp high gear response vaccine, REALLY ramp up. Haha we’ll see personally think market deflate normality begins hit NP clinic received vaccine. want tell anyone keep avoiding social engagements. interesting link. Thanks sharing it. medical experts? 26 EU countries, 5 stopped using AZ jabs, vast majority health agencies went public reassure vaccine completely fine. 

Are implying 21 ""lost ability understand basic maths""? Socialism: everyone equally poor. Getting vaccine helps around also. COVID signed vaccine today - first day state allowed so. We've argued think, sincerely, congratulations. feeling security getting second dose pretty cash.  point stay locked vaccine kids? that's cards. Indeed That's definitely good point. think also important downplay effective vaccine is, though. seems major findings, like one, going unnoticed public language surrounding vaccines always painfully cautious. People gonna go NUTS B E C H E N RIP inbox! forget ivermectin too. mean ""bet right horse""? EU ordered AZ, Pfizer Moderna. 

Here's real difference: US refuses share they're getting every single vaccine make EU forced supply world. California already ignoring cdc guidelines eligibility, sure listen this. Damn, wish competent company like Merck would partnered Oxford. bunch morons. Glad I’m going crazy. got taste mouth gone soon came. anyone else finally feel like nearing end pandemic? overly optimistic Spring 2022's going many babies Good question. guessing distrust government, others distrust health care system, great (but awful may think). type people would rush see doctor feeling unwell. also think exaggeration say vaccine easily available everywhere Russia. locations, yes, available anyone. were, point signing executive order first place?

To make look like Trump contain COVID did.  got email today make appointment, hoping husband would awesome news now. Can’t fucking wait listen fat tony Staten Island yell big bum Stanton Start vacations!! 2020: ""Look stupid Americans getting destroyed virus.""

2021: ""Save us, America!!""  think less likely. I'm really optimistic US, countries, even european ones, going substantially behind us. Good vibes Well sort did, head household vs single lot programs assistance take family size account. weird didn't.

Many programs go percentage poverty rate, like 200% high cost living areas. cutoff $61k family 5.

$112.5k far generous. look something like 12 kids reach cutoff 200%. Luckily 9 people assume brought back get dose Sorry Timmy. wanted immunity shoulda born 2005. Georgia enters chat. gut instinct MRNA vaccines may able stand air administration.

But lining people six feet apart administering vaccines assembly line style probably we'll month so. dad used tell story got one first polio vaccines, lined kids recess stuck sugar cube mouths. need something similar here. Let go. Check back second shot. feel anything first one either, second one felt like worst hangover life. May fourth us Hmm that’s really example...for specific claim :P 25-30% Europeans take AZ vaccine thanks people like Macron making stuff it, endless scares around vaccine turn unfounded. 

I guarantee 22 blood clots coincidental, among 3 million recipients vaccine higher general population. non story- next they'll claim AZ vaccine causes car crashes 17 people car crashes taking vaccine. absurd.

There scientific explanation kind mechanism would cause blood clots. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof, ""We gave vaccine 3 million people, tiny handful got athlete's foot afterwards... must vaccine done it!"". 

Those two weeks cost many lives covid. Increased vaccine hesitancy nonsense creates cost many more. 2 (!!!) deaths guaranteed unrelated.

The European Medicines Agency [has vaccine safe, events described higher general population, benefits vaccine far outweighing risks.

The vaccine cause blood clots. Covid-19 causes blood clots. want avoid getting blood clots, take vaccine! got notification city's transit agency saying restoring bus routes April 24th! major pain getting around cut 40 routes 110 due COVID. big sign things getting back normal I'm happy it! EU Germany seize BT‘s complete Marburg production (250 million doses Q2) , it’s ridiculous they‘re exported. Karma gold  “May one” lol sorry immature funny. Wow, heard year look back US doing. US selfish vaccines producing. Odd. training week. feel like needed hour. Maybe used giving injections, could handout. Let’s bet No, reality check. EU perpetually underinvests things, really want allies US can't meet R&amp;D spending (on GDP basis) minimum pay us drugs US invented? It’s like they’re going waste.. share countries population taken care Right. aware. June 26 8 weeks may 1... rest March April still go opportunities start doses. Respectfully, I’m wedding. Massachusettes, Teachers part priority ground, phase 3 gen pop, unless comorbidities 65+. changed President Biden said get teachers vaccine Gov. Baker flipped weekend. 

As equity, vaccine supply ramping up, got folks(65+) VA vaccinated last month, happening. Yes. Every day administration example this. Excellent news! continue see evidence vaccinated people spread covid-19. 

More vaccinated people = less covid-19. Still good President say think. answer “I’ve never dealt polio smallpox reason... people took chance new vaccines. Since then, we’ve gotten way better making vaccines. it’s turn take chance make sure future generations don’t deal even worse, mutated version virus.” ... weird. Thank you. vaccinated could care less person interact been. don’t want vaccine? That’s you. Don’t worry, y’all get enough soon! hesitancy public health officials state vaccinated people unlikely spread covid really damaged messaging vaccine.

It would wildly irresponsible otherwise. I’m viral immunologist wouldn’t even raised eyebrow turned vaccines 0% effective transmission still effective symptoms. know? May fourth Congratulations!! Much Europe suspended using AZ vaccines today. saying good bad decision that’s moment Why? Lmao Astra Zenica vaccines. used phase 3 clinical trial over. Honestly clear vaccine even get approval time US enough Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J country.

These doses contract Astra Zenica probably can't withdraw application point without losing money probably would ship out. Hopefully things ramping soon terms administration + supply prefer per capita, site probably saw comparison situations (a) part time first dose second dose given; (b) longer time first dose which, protocol, included second dose. see information show latter figure would high second dose well? see 8 people...why even story? That’s really advice want fuck up. think they’re right thing caving pressure throwing guidance without extremely confident. That’s kind thing walk back aware takes basically 6 weeks get person full immunity first shot (for moderna Pfizer; can’t speak J&amp;J). protection interim, let’s-gather-in-masses type protection. Plenty shots available. Look distributed vs used world leader fake news. Always double check sources. going happen anyways? Supply ramping 20% people already gotten it. Yay! thank you! It’s definitely something interesting think about! think ultimately boils much cross-reactive protection epitomes have; there’s enough then, affinity maturation, we’ll see protection variants targeted. Otherwise would think process would restarted immune system?

I’ll research more, I’m sure works! Yeah, psychological thing. He'll look better beat expectations would gave earlier date push back. opposite approach previous administration. Last July 4th, regional flareups states seen severe rise case. VT 2 cases. 200, NH 14, possible small gatherings precaution place. Yeah that’s I’m sayin. can’t say 100% sincerity *no* potential side effects fastest developed vaccine history. *know* Covid significant damage health. One risk simply outweighs other. Yeah fuck citizens give countries GDP like Asheville NC instead. 

Makes much sense. don’t build self administer doses? Seems like obvious solution. Jabbing needle super easy.  Sounds like Brazil gonna petri dish variants. 16+ might get soon think younger might wait bit. Texas checking winning lotto seems easier He’ll ask states.

Just like Trump can’t “open states, president authority states implement vaccine distribution. even gonna waste time here. Thanks writing book though lol takes way air kill you. fine dust people compressed air. harmful people would drop dead got windy isn’t case cautious. It’s unusual vaccine candidate 0% effective transmission also still effective illness. never hear never make clinic. I'm side world family well - hardest part year knowing get something happen. Hope well family! Fan fucking tastic news buy much media hype. Eventually things go back normal. Humans social creatures touch important sense. Mayo Clinic press release... feel many ways. Pre-March, wasn’t goal oriented. Today, goals want achieve. guess talking part made grow. Speak Ah, EU. Yeah, hopefully Biden sending countries excess vaccines end 30 million doses currently bottled AstraZeneca’s facility West Chester, Ohio, handles “fill-finish,” final phase manufacturing process vaccine placed vials, one official knowledge stockpile said. 

I wondering happening AZ doses paid wait US trial data come assumed given countries. can't believe they're sitting warehouse somewhere zero good. stupid. immediately ship Canada, Mexico anywhere else reasonably close injected arms **ASAP**. We're likely going approve timeline going significantly improve US's timeline. True  interesting little sobering reading comments - Korea, time last year start one first major spikes remember talking lot foreign friends seriously considering returning West fear virus spread SK much.

In honesty feel bit guilt perhaps - family friends America across board incredibly difficult year financially terms mental health. Meanwhile, barring restrictions large gatherings mask-wearing, life fairly normal, something I'm eternally grateful for.

I increasingly aware entire swath cultural fabric I've missed - endless memes/articles/discussions WFH, lockdown, quarantining, etc. things can't relate all, bit weird seeing shared American experience emerge I'm part slightest. 

I'm extremely grateful however - tested twice free local health centers, never year fear health. intense sympathy lot posters sub gone worst year lives. Here's hoping every day gets little bit better Star Wars Day come baby!!!! assumes person working grocery store able go doctor diagnosis. lot service jobs, find coverage, pushes people call sick take time off. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Big stuff way. Great news. got first shot Pfizer Tuesday (NY restaurant worker makes eligible). went Syracuse State Fair site. Including mandatory 15 minutes wait time shot, 22 minutes. 2:03-2:25. summer gonna LIT! know word means, say can’t wake want everything back except handshakes  Lol keep thinking sounds like vaccine sugar cube point asking. anyway they're going get way. wanna go bar get shithoused friends fight someone. 

It's simple life honest shenanigans. Congrats you’re 10 percent. Laughs California population 29 states combined...we barely handling 65+ teachers right now. *We'll filling pews Easter.* I’m starting think people like shaming people. bet hall monitors kids. Except trump dogshit liar concept accountability actually still give developing countries.

An older friend mine remembers confused mother dragged two towns could sugar cube, dumbfounded mother excited sugar. idea making history. Thing is, jobs great get right companies.

I'd highly reccomend anything medical device related.

I keep candidates place various reasons, people I've place medical device companies warehouse, assembly, entry level QI QC roles leads making $30+ hour within 2 years. sky really limit, keep getting great pay increases title increases.

do 10+ years easily quality manager director something like. look much people make. mine set mid September. worried time. things looking up. Really excited, honest. UK weeks/a month behind US rate EU catch summer vaccine speed ups. September/October things pretty normal Europe.  much fuckin’! love it!  love this! people think go back normal vaccines widely available, we? Yes is, data show people still questioning effectiveness. Canadian, see media bombards us ""Variants Concern"" news previews. tune media Western countries, case extent. Why? Appointments already April, everyone might well make appointments Ah, obvious explanation! Somehow certain tests got mostly steady, even try check them

Thanks! Okay, it’s good Chinese variant South African variant? decided topic? Don’t forget kids won’t vaccinated. Yes mostly low risk, still. mean overall people receive vaccine faster? You’ll fine firmly believe entirely due new administration. would sacrificing another summer federal government hadn’t gotten shit together question: 

I received first dose Meadowlands (East Rutherford, NJ) realized scheduled second dose 3/29, 18 days first dose.

From I'm reading online, strongly recommended get second dose *exactly* 21 days after. come across 4-day grace period prior 21st day I'm reading conflicting info.

Should try re-schedule appointment 21 days leave it? thread giggling. can’t wait (vaccinated) summer Oh much resonate that. feeling crying tears joy stand crowd people enjoying songs together. cancel trip go see NYE20 show hoping see last summer Folsom. I’m really feeling stupid, “prepayment” mean context? 

The government doesn’t generally pay taxes, they’re sending $1400. checks advances refund? that’s really going suck true.

Or strictly talking child credit?  know don’t one stuck somewhere opensourceslayer  Think bad would US govt gave away vaccines catastrophe happened would cause need vaccines. going wait every american chance get vaccinated giving away. Allocation feds next week (3/15) less 16 million doses pfizer+moderna. J&amp;J believe million.

So clear, expect deliveries go 17 million next week 40 million weeks that?

I want believe PO schedules closer get ""due"" think had. trust manufacturing throughput meet volume demands least couple months. I'm going say yes no, fine hang without masks. unvaccinated person house, odds getting sick almost zero, odds getting sick similarly low. Fucking amazing hear Splatoon 3? Oh yeah, premature reopening dicey situation! Florida 100% open business since maybe early fall, beginning holiday season. hard, frightening winter you’d see people acting like absolutely nothing wrong. you’d feel like crazy one, know? know sounds weird, makes question sanity. Haha Thankfully, things look much brighter now! 

You’re right irresponsible coworkers restaurants. fact, wife’s coworker sent home office earlier week wife tested positive. went bar Friday night hosted indoor kids birthday party Saturday. even knows idiot picked up. Florida like that. 

My wife wears good mask, runs large true HEPA air purifier desk, refuses speak people closer 10 feet so. it’s like Florida—share office dangerous people unemployed. 🤷‍♀️

Good luck there! Sounds like family tight game. Keep good fight. 😀 That's entirely true actually, good point. ITT: Defensive Americans bother read article. vaccine effective variants claims be, don’t see needing get boosters likely outcome unless health reasons.

The rollout approach herd immunity point flare ups, variant otherwise, won’t take footholds summer. Novavax even worse position AZ. serum Institute said can't even start manufacturing till US lifts ban materials required produce Novavax 2021: ""Save us, America!!""

More like ""hey America, imposing export bans private (non-American) company wants sell paying customers, vaccine using, approved, even developed America."" pretty reasonable question TBH. words Skippy, mine Gotcha. Thanks! show prove eligible? Trump got wonderful vaccines benefiting now. wonder long buffer May 1st actually get guess boils fact don’t know facts. click bait

Then maybe click it, wrong, article AZ vaccines literally sitting warehouses. 4,000 likely vaccinated. got polio vaccine. put sugar cube gave kids school. kids love sugar. like treat. **10 million**... bet. possibly-marriage-problem sized percentage next stimulus check allocated fireworks 4th. It’s thing eastern medicine. cultural thing. America done nothing stop taking antibiotics start feel tiny bit better. infection comes back take antibiotics again. Yeah live like one top ten places millennials per capita, still pretty tight restrictions. bars go back before, it’s gonna nuts. Like, they’re open rn really same. Obviously way less people, bar stools aren’t like right next it’s harder talk people. Unless go people know talk sit outside, it’s kinda pointless. 

But that’s over, bets off. entirely binary, black white, 100% one side's fault other's. big target misses AZ, true, UK also relied AZ vaccine program going far better, government oversight building supply chain contract stronger punitive measures AZ missed targets, evidently possible get good results them. 
 
Meanwhile, EU's contract seems entirely reliant ""best efforts"" leaving AZ it, hoping sort everything themselves, obviously haven't. Seems like rather naive approach. EU later setting AZ production experiencing problems this.

At least HMG AstraZeneca claim so. Actually, imported Netherlands Germany. Would interesting see, many doses produced UK. I’m everyone getting vaccinated I’m nurse surgery center successfully get vaccinated. It’s hard trying get appointments, going barely prioritized healthcare workers? together since began. run homeless shelter vets. I've lurking since good repository information news.

Look headlines, boys girls. Look now.

I wish could hug all. Theres light ahead. Cue parties ""UP 2020!!!"" Maybe, covid seeming bring crazies, trust getting injection someone least sit hour training course. “Closer normal”

What meant “gather small groups” company made call go virtual first permanently, I’m hyped Semen flow like water. Influenza Streptococcus pneumoniae impart bit immunity SARS-CoV-2. latter two may ravaged lungs mean immune system prepared stop pneumonia-inducing pathogens. fact, history pneumonia could far know increase risk depending much lung capacity lost. feel like gonna baby boom everyone vaccinated 😂 Black Widow opening weekend!!!!

But reality smell mask burning bashes Zoom deleting parties droves, middle fingers aloft! Oh god choose interpret headline based makes guy sound belong prison death sentence. University Oxford actually makes profit. AstraZeneca isn't. That's one reasons roll shambles. incentive AstraZeneca prioritise it. Contrary Pfizer. BBQ friends July doesn’t mean large events. 

Yea, that’s jack. 

4 months gather *small groups*? America deserve though. Well cakes are. would still apply. 12,000 calorie days come Already like bars open. Roaring 20’s coming think Biden elected still top working grocery store full time job retirement home weekend job. real conversation make tough choices. decided risk great retirement age community serving stay. keep full time job survive. could never lived guilt unknowingly catching virus spreading highest risk population. mom way.
I think problem people comparing ""the vaccine"" ""nothing"" (because either think covid exists think get it). point out, accurate example ""the vaccine"" vs ""covid"".

For (40m), easy choice. easy vaccinate child if/when happens. Could explain sugar cube thing? zero impact vaccine availablity till US vaccinated. serum Institute said can't even start manufacturing till US let's ingredients exported. serum contracted produce half entire world. Copy pasted vaccines used, it’s like US sit wearhouses.

The vaccines make clinical use humans best best. aren’t representative every vaccine candidate ever existed. currently approved vaccines brand-new-to-human technology novel virus. It’s completely fucking unreasonable assume they’ll perform well vaccines tried true decades (many don’t actually prevent transmission themselves). Regardless fact single socialist country Europe, 'one guy rest die' sound better? usually go ""you afraid little needle."". ;) This. pandemic endemic. lot diseases. Copy pasted vaccines used, it’s like US sit wearhouses.

J&amp;J spend time making vaccines instead downvoting post :( right? They’re correct masks public, social distancing.

I recommend reading actual guidelines rather making assumptions. Physical distancing still recommended public. immediately said stuff along lines I’m sure people ignore it, say lied come May 1st exactly said happens. obvious? Pennsylvania definitely track meet goals based current progress. PA listens opens eligibility May 1st, obvious chain events. beer Uk colleagues work wework free beer. there’s don’t feel obligated answer this, anybody chip in, something weird going vaccine order Pennsylvania? follow group Youtubers Philadelphia based 20s 30s several gotten first shot past week. essential worker wait age groups turn, surprised. looked it, seemed Pennsylvania Philadelphia still working elderly. announced appointments via social media ahead time, weren’t unclaimed vaccines snagged.

Can't get locations turned away closer ones car stay whole time. Great news. important note end article:


""There one's wrinkle worth noting. Pfizer Moderna need ""release"" doses government fulfill contractual obligations, meaning doses leave factories counted toward commitment. companies say they're ready go distribution. companies hit contractual targets doses delivered vaccination sites."" *cries Canadian hope able get soon. Crossing fingers you. omg ????? profit? Yes, masks social distancing still recommended public. assume mean. I'm amazed going quickly states 

Here Chile, 26% think vaccinated, eligible either 65, 50 certain disease complication, teacher, health worker certain conditions. Look, want say obvious flaws distribution, last 40 days things going crazy speed turns *could* gotten shot today wait May administrations tough time, I’d still okay that.

There vaccine, several vaccines, getting them. timeline getting shorter shorter. know it’s hard stay positive we’re final stretch they’re moving goal post towards us, down. also asked states make educators eligible, least Pennsylvania, per request. Maybe all, states listen Another baby boom hit. Orrrrr STDs gonna rampant.

people wanting get vaccine doesnt affect yall way, vaccinated wont risk anymore, decision Ditto. 

Pfizer here. US gets shit together

The US 4.5% world’s population responsible 30% total global vaccine injections.

Would interested know idea ‘having shit together’ is. quite Frank that's data is. Israel entire nation Pfizer scientific standpoint that's cleanest data work hear much it. remember Moderna Pfizer nearly identical, lay person point view inference Moderna effective sufficient scientifically sufficient. things working working stunningly well like many people threads saying actually really amazing. personally received Pfizer yesterday would relieved received Moderns. doubt We’re gonna another baby boom ...Have guys going outside whole time? know still safely go outside... last part calls empathy. fence whether get vaccinated hopefully tipping point realization getting vaccinated health safety others future generations. agree they're ramping up. got first dose couple days ago state run site LA. took moment ask guy gave shot things been. replied they've busy great. opened site slated 6k vaccinations per day. said giving 7-8k expect go up.

I drive took hour half total road again. Walk 25 minutes though. can't calls national unity bipartisanship, President Joe Biden top aides declined give Trump administration credit nation's COVID-19 vaccine rollout **while relying heavily system established Wait, trying ignore them? Trump take lesson. dont let states fend forr global emergency funny everything pointed true. life trainwreck. Oh yes dad friends steal fire truck. sorry saying opinion end day nothing say clearly matters :) yayy:)) I’m doing, say won’t see she’s vaccinated. show proof want. mom also said worried vaccine, ultimatum her. excess doses maybe send developing countries. don’t want new variants spreading could immune vaccines. Colorado bullshitting everyone, meanwhile Philly line get vaccinated wrapped around multiple city blocks I've heard JnJ gets continuously protective time even months. sure there's magic number can't less 14 days. Totally agree. :-) lot easier quarantine working person loses job, house, family goes hungry.

If government really cared would get economy going first. **DJs**: Raise hands hate COVID! interesting say week Scotland published figures supply (against advice), EU went bat-shit crazy concluded week invoking article 16 trying kick-start paramilitary violence Ireland.

It's easy know supply getting tight government said was, delivery improvements. might work generations, Boomers seem give much shit grandchildren. feel. I’ve masked socially distancing much possibly could. work person good 6 months so. I’m lucky enough fully vaccinated, endless takes even fully vaccinated people still need distance wear masks doesn’t make sense me. understand still level risk matter slice it, I’m sure eventually people vaccinated it’s going seem pointless keep mandates, fear good chunk people going cling righteousness staying home = saving lives there’s always going 1% percent chance risking illness. oh well, have. let's see actually happens Damn that's really nice setup Tripping large crowds people definitely something miss Dead Co concert literally perfect place that. it'll sell 10 minutes, smart guy. us want get can’t though we’re “essential”. want get get with. would President (yes, including Trump). I’ve eligible weeks, getting appointment impossible - sit refresh stupid page multiple times per day (there’s one place county get appointment it’s “no appointments available”). well, know covid damage health. since im 20s, healthy risk-increasing conditions, risk factors low imo risk vaccine undiscovered long term effects outweighs covid.

before reddit shits opinion, ask decision affects you, since everyone else opportunity vaccinate anyways since im lowest-risk category. Man can’t wait go incredibly overcrowded beach actually enjoy surrounded people. heads agree everything said video, i'm curious others think it.  win election get take credit, thems rules. Reducing rampant spread Covid worldwide ASAP best interest U.S. though, rampant spread elsewhere might result variants eventually make way U.S. render current vaccines less effective.  I'm sitting BC, Canada, looking like I'll eligible near September.. Damn disagree, never know. one thing know is, kept saying wouldn’t vaccine soon actually did. confirm! way.  Implode? think that’s happened dunno tell you. day-to-day situation US overblown nth degree media. We’re fine.  Ha that's awesome! old she? Even gets covid would 98% chance recovering depending age according cdc Plot twist: dude wear rubber times This, along really elaborating criteria eligibility, feels bit empty.

Since eligibility guarantee shot, could declare everyone eligible tomorrow we're basically situation. seems like could wait April 30th say, ""okay, everyone eligible now!"" declare victory. 

I wish would said stakes actually needs happen hit target rather put target vague enough can't really miss it. know far now? *May 1st 2022 could eat 200 lbs ice cream mean gonna happen Hey guys, quick question. tested pos days ago, slept much could, went symptoms mild fever, body ache/headache, sore throat (this worst me).

Kim Reaper (Kim Reynolds, IA) needs step vaccine administration efficiency Iowa people pre-existing conditions get vaccinated free-for-all.

One big corporation make move, rest follow next week. Walmart it, example, would expect Target, Kroger, etc make move soon after. Actually, would had. Vaccine distribution already accelerating Trump still office. really can’t serious. Anyone who’s fence isn’t worth saving. It’s time accept losses move on.   mass vaccination clinics Ridgefield, Kennewick, Spokane, Wenatchee. get one those? Especially friends family anti-vaxxers, better go get vaccinated tell anyone, rather get arguments it. nearly everyone's vaccinated time start throwing parties again, matter people know vaccinated not, now, really matter. Gonna get snip snap. Gonna hot boy summer 21 Roaring 20's gonna joke :p Slight correction multiple vaccines actually developed US. Johnson Johnson one, Novavax, Moderna etc. I'd reading COVID January concerned. first US death announced end February, husband decided start stocking dry goods shelf stable food. visited client nursing home March 3 assistant using copious amounts hand sanitizer little freaked it. children's schools already changing illness protocol, started working home.

On night March 12, learned schools state closed rest month, surreal point on. upset stock market tanked following week - bleak visions 1930s-esque depression, freaked would lose incomes home. started cutting spending hoarding cash (stimulus, tax refund, first quarter bonus). indeed, husband laid end April (we'd expected 2020, middle pandemic). 

The lay honestly good thing. got husband job hated, allowed handle child care/schooling could work. got generous severance package (17 weeks pay + 5 months COBRA premiums), expanded unemployment take home pay actually increased. firm loss income business; actually busy income increased 2020. ten months worth bills/expenses bank, better financially year ago. 

The downside youngest child, severely autistic, making great progress prior lockdown, regressed bit. We've lost year interventions desperately needed. I'm hopeful he'll catch up, home 24/7 disabled child emotionally broken us both. finally caved applied disability services get respite care personal support worker. silver lining enabled us, parents (who provided care him), get vaccinated Phase 1A.

 surprised many antivaxers are. government promising delivering.

Nice try though. Please delete post, think worth rest world see guys think. Big cities shortages rural areas not. weird way Ok Trump pushed Reddit media would automatically it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yet states like Texas pulling mask mandate. Biden anything aside form calling governor Neanderthal. Sounds like something Trump would lol. Absolutely thing ‘sleep 6 room’.

I know crew rest areas look like. They’re still spread apart normal pax. Hot. Lol Phew, looks like I'm safe Kowtow; others pointed it’s directive everybody track anyway. know percentage needed herd immunity? Measles 95%, polio 80%, think estimate R0 around less polio, wonder 75-80% would enough. citations really researched it, take grain salt. something realistic 

Is much ask point there's basis behind statement. scientists spent years years studying testing vaccines qualified say ita ready is. arbitrary internal clock? Look want get vaccine dont get it. Id recommend make choices even wholly wrong so. pat back ""letting live data guide you"" when, unless extremely highly qualified researcher, dontbeven knowledge necessary interpret data. Jesus christ. Yes people. not. *extremely* Trump fan vast majority vaccine supply come contracts signed Trump. one still held press conference yet guess Realistically disadvantage getting J&amp;J shot lower chance preventing getting covid? still like around 86% anyway?  Empathy definitely best approach. Vaccine hesitance rooted ignorance, fear well. know people generally smart anti-vaccine skeptical COVID vaccine fast made. boils distrust government. tell I'm getting vaccinated guinea pig, hope things begin reopen see someone know trust setbacks, they'll follow lead. One friends who's seems coming around now. aren’t overly optimistic. Things much better soon people risk vaccinated. genuinely surprised one. many people know, including need see mental health professional. results may vary, obviously, FWIW experience. got second dose 28th February shithead governor (I’ll give two guesses one) lifted mask mandate state days ago. People *immediately* stopped wearing masks bunch places town aren’t required anymore and, man, really thought going feel super uncomfortable want go anywhere, least would resent fuckers caring anybody themselves. 

But honestly? mostly relieved. It’s nice feel like things getting back normal first time year, wasn’t scared around maskless people running errands. know still risks, I’m still careful. always wear mask, keep distance people, still haven’t eaten inside restaurant. know maskless people haven’t vaccinated lot probably don’t want vaccine. hope get sense relief year bullshit, really nice feeling. Getting 100% back normal probably going take really long time baby step enough lift spirits. Yeah hes saying ""Heres missed cause virus, get vaccinated finally things again"" example Uhhh! Easter, hello! hard date Easter Covid disappear like miracle. wonder happened? July AAL call looking pretty hot right now. Lets gooooo, open back up. side effects people worry things wouldn’t see years. Hard truth element crossing fingers toes hoping goes well these.  Many people aren’t huddled away homes petrified covid. it’s complex decisions some. course you’ll bark moon crazies think they’re microchipped. Can’t help that. genuinely concerned shouldn’t told they’re part problem though. 

I plan getting mine. However we’re way dismissive concerns. It’s like want lump people concerned vaccines people shout MMR vaccine. Walk around listen podcasts, fart general direction asshole neighbor's house, ride bike, go run, take hikaroo, fish, go mushroom picking, walk around blizzard. million different thinks there, Mark. Walk appointment South Lousiana right anyone 16+ comorbidity (and qualifications rather lax.  overweight, smoking, etc) people need trying get shots arms here. really hope so. 

The limit area moment lack vaccination sites. lack vaccine. They've closed mass vaccination sites much give out.  

You say enough supply it. hope so. fantastic problem getting people take it. lot people know won’t take “it takes years develop vaccine” even though used research SARS 1 Mers.

Plus one friends thinks causes infertility women? don’t know got idea all. Summer museums goooo someone need work gets money somebody else would say this. People can't stay home cause need money live, people can't work home. Restrictions can't individual decision, collective decision.

That said, restrictions end soon. weeks justification them. please stop using stupid selfish arguments: reason ending steady decrease hospitalizations deaths begin soon. thought too. liked going before, I'm pretty uncomfortable get groups lines now. wonder long take acclimation occur. “Hey send screenshot use it, thanks?” got lot replies but, least Pfizer one, could maybe make case people take medications time give second thought. Things like Zoloft, Lipitor Viagra. medications designed target specific problems, like COVID vaccine.

Same J&amp;J suppose Moderna might one necessarily want advise digging on, lol. get wrong, assume also safe others they've fair share controversy years think someone already fence safety vaccine could safely assume they'd see public facing articles history (I mean think Wikipedia would enough push someone back) instantly decide right get vaccine.

Good luck.  Fuck thats great news. Canada get shit together. masks first became ubiquitous, mother-daughter duo walk past store; daughter “fake” coughed direction foot away me, scurried laughing. absolutely believe hit 300k infections per day - pandemic brought absolute worst US culture. Wow! Thank work. 
 
Did lose regulars Covid shelter? mean, spent life ""normal"" conditions covid conditions. seems daunting, work back slowly social/public life. great all, people also realistic waitilists.

 lot elderly people still yet get vaccinated. going immediately get one can. Sorry party pooper. might actually get walk uni graduation commencement 👏😭  It’s amazing complete 180 we’ve seen administrations subject. mean, that’s essentially Oklahoma lol haven’t done damn thing. governor repealed covid restrictions, like Texas, husband told raging. couldn’t think single restriction actually removed. mean look texas people eating inside restaurants.. I'm glad though wanna finish school classroom I'm tired online bs. Maybe easy way wanna get without learning shit, wanna pediatrician wanna mess child's well it'll hang consciousness. clear, ""eligible vaccine May 1"" probably means overnight April 30 May 1, number people able sign appointments triples. They'll booking appointments end may (at least). *first* shot. puts second shot late June. turn puts full efficacy Mid-late July. people taking proactive steps get vaccine ASAP.

They almost certainly deliberately conservative projections future restrictions, seriously doubt things (or, well, *should* be) back normal July. Even great news. Unconstitutional. 'power' President. Pennsylvanian educator here. got URL? employer's offering us hundred dollars get vaccinated, great, help can't actually get vaccinated. Desantis Abbott great getting states vaccinated talking lmao Fantastic news! saving grace, huge longshot, people NY CA keep moving electorate going turn D. Hope y'all ready Fourth July American Fuck'n'Suck Extravaganza! 


That's meant small gathering, right? say that? Dang, San Diego county 10,000-20,000 vaccinations day. Brazil least significant number people acquired immunity first/second wave getting sick varient. concerning issue IMHO. hand though, true overall pace become slightly ""disappointing"" past week so. We're still going fast whole thing big achievement proud of, particular moment seems like we're making mistakes areas. Distribution started REALLY outpace administration recently, suggesting we're either properly ramping administration methods/sites, over-restricting access vaccine.

For example, pretty much everyone (at least posts read) fully expected we'd 3 million day week, massive supply. even really get close, think highest day like 2.5 million. that's there's tons supply getting used. old think Millenials are? oldest 40s. They're ones going flooding clubs bars. Half country seeing black man elected president brought absolute worst US culture. fucks still can't fathom it, let alone accept it.  Traditional trials total waste time. 130 invites ready go. venue “fit” 35 Covid. venue trying say “deal it” might take court.   Hopefully vaccine supplies available believe data coming Israel Pfizer vaccine hopeless. Mostly anger frustration inconsistencies lockdowns politics played throughout. Definitely lost faith humanity. Letting random dudes nut inside lmao Greheasy seems like perfect time try. Everyone rusty social interaction. Me, find envying idea massive party anything, realize much I'd miss little things like grabbing beer coworkers lunch friend. Definitely going take things granted. no. &amp; India largest donor simply facility inoculate people would rather make roaring 20s back  Hopefully much longer 16+, still going anywhere daughter vaccinated. people administer though. One thing shots, another get arms. sure seems like forced Indiana start vaccinating teachers, though. governor petulant think even said much. assume federal government withhold vaccine states won’t comply. It’s gonna slow rollout - acknowledge I’m anxious person. 

I’m still going curbside pickup everything I’m fully immune (few weeks shot 2?). 

Once that, I’ll wear N95 stores I’ll go shopping necessities. excess N95’s, figure use em. 

Then hear decent mass people local community vaccinated, I’ll start eating outside restaurants wear cloth masks advised. 

A weeks I’ll comfortable back normal life. 

My guesstimate I’ll “back normal” sometime mid July. new baby boom coming Don’t forget Mexico, government terrible job 😭 Trials red tape.... Why? Nothing happened... Someone last week. Known conservative leader... AMLO You’re wrong. I’m far past school age recall textbooks always ripoff lot love lost there. used population tree divided doses we're getting end June 2 applied top end population got 50 older funny reading I'm coming covid. Biden replacing orange guy pretty high Give vulnerable first, heavy exposure, like doctors. Reduce death count targeting likely die first. Basically state point. ever was. anti-vaxxers living fear all... libs..... fuck, got owned. TLDR:

Long COVID symptoms include:

* fatigue
* headache
* dyspnea (difficulty breathing)
* anosmia (loss sense smell)

How many long COVID:

* 13.3% symptoms 4+ weeks
* 4.5% symptoms 8+ weeks
* 2.3% symptoms 12+ weeks

Risk factors identified long COVID:

* Older
* Higher body mass index
* Female
* Experiencing 5 symptoms first week That’s horrible. I’m sorry state country failed you. hope recover quickly. That’s joke getting drunk fuck know lying?

I'm wondering basing on. Interesting. people long time vape enthusiasts DIY they're familiar PEG 400. used widespread vape sauce largely abandoned regular PG. peculiar plastic aftertaste  ""what gonna do, stab me?"" don’t need everything 100%, completely normal

Okay? Good you? 

None restrictions listed supposedly reasonable mass vaccination make fucking sense. Like, denying efficacy vaccines preventing serious illness transmission point?? South Carolina.. letter boss site saying eligible got vaccination site one cared even asked it. Well done Biden! Oh, man. good, inaugurated better. Specially storming. seriously got nervous state democracy that. Yeah, little concerning. isn’t bad would past people risk vaccinated now. makes sense people going go 4th regardless they're vaxxed not, might well try get many adults possible June 31st. states don’t open 65 vulnerable. isn’t fault all. Yeah ok continues, telling many variants co-exist, co-infect interact produce yet new variants. virologist, mere thought scary. I’d subscribe news letter front line worker, havent stopped since last march. Still single word I'll vaccinated hearing plenty others. Summer George isn’t saying everyone vaccine may 1st. Production productivity shortages may hamper that.  doubt many states running behind. got lucky cause docs office starting next week, able to, need doctors offices. It’s hard enough medical disability. I’m afraid of. live Maryland vaccine rollout sucks; many eligible people can’t get appointment trying hours night. I’m scared it’s gonna look like general population eligible don’t know anyone doesn’t want get it. No. I’m 18 hoping get Johnson Johnson vaccine. Something brought said 14 days ONE DOSE 83% effective actually pneumonia right pandemic hit. recovered, went back work, know sending everyone else right back out. think experience pneumonia person 30s made take COVID way seriously. Pneumonia debilitated me. I’m much better now, I’m still feeling effects year passed. CT scan scheduled couple weeks check irregularities chest spotted months ago. Hoping it’s scar tissue nothing serious.

If COVID anything close pneumonia nobody wants even recover. It’s worst feeling getting sick knowing it’s going end. wasn’t sure going feel vaccine became available me, soon already door. fantastic problem getting people take it. lot people know won’t take “it takes years develop vaccine” even though used research SARS 1 Mers.

I get people. Even quasi-legit concern November/December, anymore. Several months several million vaccinations later, one turned zombie much minor, temporary side effects. Time alone overcome objections. care elaborate? totally hear that! truly mind-blowing dealing many things really saw movies distant history before. really hit, me, first time YouTube recommended ""How make mask sewing"" video craft channel. seeing random person usually probably talked crochet something teaching people make mask bandana.... kind wake-up. Like shit really going down.

Since one like ""constant reality check"" type deals read something like parent comment stop second realize we're still insane timeline feels like movie. 

I totally agree, we're free live normally taking granted again. Many states did...mine, Utah, one them. what? going give vaccines back? funny! Originally 8/29/20! Really? going whine this? give dunce caps everyone else. I’d concerned aware legitimate reason be. mRNA delivery hasn’t used vaccine knowledge it’s used cancer treatments years. exactly vaccines gives reason think it’s dangerous covid? way.  submission linking msn.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m excited get vaccine word “eligible” instead “available” makes nervous. I'm fucking dying Hundreds millions doses available every month, expect enough vaccines every American Apri

Lmao said September. Donald Trump saved world!!! Lmmmaaaoooo

Edit: probably moron get hundreds millions vaccines per month we'd shit now. Try thinking things sometime masks? vaccine works, right?  mean, distributing high rate right now. we've done horribly lot aspects virus, vaccine distribution one them. Given age average worker, expected. would much rather focus elderly make largest portion COVID deaths hospitalizations. Got first Pfizer shot today. feel like preparation medication, loading syringe take much time actual jab. 

They’re also supervising 15 (or 30 allergy potential) minutes vaccination. I’m way. Looks like get shot next week, I’ll fully good around late May. It’s going huge issue around people, gained sort agoraphobia, don’t like leaving house anymore. might start small friend group meetings. xbox series x im still waiting 60 fps ready. /r/hydrohomies concur tend agree - consider people would *refuse* vaccine, people going go way get it. point we'll employing phone banks cold call people try convince take 5 minutes day stop pharmacy get shot. 

We going half population fully protected July 4th. BUT, point say ""the vaccine available anyone wants it, healthy adults socialize risk"". obviously keep pressure towards full immunization help protect can't get vaccinated unlucky still catching vaccine. Lol doubt that. ""flip switch"" society go 12+ months told ""shaking hands kill you"" ""go unprotected sex everyone"".

Those type wild crazy sex kept throughout pandemic I've heard. rest normies going wait deprogramming process, understandably going take time. Maybe 12 months, definitely weeks whatever Redditors worked frenzy believing. thanks. Hard pass Hope guys better vaccination distribution plan Oregon. partner 1A group 4 still able get vaccinated. I'll 1B group 6, technically able get mine end month. ain't holding breath.  feel like deaths hospitalizations continue fall even cases completely level off. don’t know. here!!!! original date? Mine 9/12/20 Fun fact: week marks 1 year anniversary university cancelling in-person classes kicking everyone campus, coincides state decided lock down. 

🎉🎉🎉 going wear mask crowded store long time, airplane rest life. Ah, thanks, truly apologize defensive thank help. 

Literally I’ve talked Moderna said take “interpretation” grain salt real world data displayed amazing vaccines. shouldn’t putting - anyone happy either them. 

I gotten doses Pfizer live someone gotten doses Moderna. We’d bet anything level protection going practically environment. Biden's ""Hello"" relieving line 4 years. No, private companies operating within EU did. Big difference. feeling people uproar matter happens Well let’s see competent federal government patterning cali do. basis second paragraph conjecture. I’m straying official CDC statements. loosen restrictions somewhat meet small groups. 

The numbers know 50% least vaccinated. go hog wild mass gatherings masks going drive infection rate mass less lethal seniors are
mostly vaccinated still inflict lasting damage heart respiratory systems. Neat, fixing minimum wage Healthcare too? many people die lack care poor quality life many due poor wage? Better focus solely disease thats barely blip radar big scheme things. Especially vaccines rolling anyway

I guess claiming solved non-issue easier making actual lasting change. Fuck got 1400 dollar check though California here, every eligible person know wants shot able find one within days becoming eligible. It’s 100% easy, require making phone calls shots put moderate effort finding appointment slot Pneumonia virus, symptom. Covid literally gives people pneumonia. personally believe people always sad assholes. visible now. like reverse version movie Live. wear mask (i.e. visibly making effort support collective struggle) see awfulness before. wish something one could help them: seem unhappy. JandJ didn’t make shit till got approved Nah, fuck that. Enough people think know better medical professionals living sudden kids dying things eradicated decades ago. think Fauci resign pandemic over. think best, definitely unfairly targeted, messaging errors resignation would help us move past this. Sure, managed secure substantial amount vaccine supply. Vaccines would sitting freezers right streamlined top-down plan funding get vaccines distributed widespread local level people’s arms. States would spending energy trying get share supply rather organizing mass sites health care workers administer shots. States already budgets decimated healthcare systems overwhelmed crisis.

Trump’s admin organized distribution healthcare workers elderly care homes expected hand supply states without additional resources guidance.

I’m starting let cautiously optimistic. I'm LE eligible pharmacist asked mom wanted since want go waste. plenty Louisiana. think Biden calling states open ""capable"" list include people like dentists, EMTs, midwives, etc., improve staffing. God good. basically put idiot governor notice pandering specific interest groups come end six short weeks. Fair enough. point this? wanna see flappers making comeback Well achkually, seem forgotten nut driver drives nuts, fellow degenerate Hold line people blow summer. got vaccine today VA really excited. Apparently asked people wanted extra dose said no. ran like prize game show shouted “no take backs!” wants J&amp;J shit vac? Give Pfizer Moderna Thank you! keys vault. 

“We allocating X% vaccines states opened eligibility adults.” guys prob next Happy you! got first weekend guy administered said awesome see people literally giddy get shot. don’t even like Biden world would better place president instead trjmp  Yes, UK competent got deals done AZ early production problems newly-stablished UK facilities resolved. EU incompetent dithered months insisted negotiating discount vaccine *being sold cost*, production issues EU facilities faced yet resolved. Mystery solved.  got covid work sure. tolerate it, can.

Except elderly proven less severe symptoms receiving vaccine younger people. literally said I'm still 100% getting it, I'm worried tolerating I'm apprehensive feeling like shit days. think lot states rapidly set systems really bad conditions, funding guidance even steady timeliness vaccine supply. systems evolved geared towards hoarding vaccine vulnerable. Biden actually top this, feels like directive say ""prioritize shots arms, I'll get supply, trust me."" Rebuilding trust governments people crucial. got pneumonia 31. sick 90 days, repeatedly fever 105. remaining year anytime cold relapse. That's people facing post-covid. everyone lot people mother ..  am, indeed, backing up. Moderna found 6-fold decrease antibody titers, Pfizer found 3-fold decrease (in study linked).  origin comment chain began claim pfizer's vaccine better B.1.351. reason difference likely Pfizer use real  It’s party someone ends dead pool! 99% recovery rate - warrant shutting world mass administering vaccines ? Papi Biden coming through. guess JJ vaccine probably distributed healthiest population studies going done see much likely get Covid vaccinated reduce stop precautions vs continuing them? lower flu cases year, seems encouraged continue mask wearing going forward even covid subsides, least flu season. Personally, wore N95 plane covid least get weird looks. didn’t beginning? Serious question. really enough doses? projecting wouldn’t enough? ? 17 weeks severance package? can't US company. husband got furloughed without pay 3 days apart (from different companies we'd worked 6 years for). even care 5 months pregnant depending income. Thankfully husband got called back month later. furlough without pay remained. able go back 6 weeks child paid cent 6 weeks. covid saved years baby struggle. gone like that. Thankfully I've able make extra money finding old ugly furniture fixing painting odd jobs people. mom absolute angel helped us choose paying car payment getting groceries. think would've lost car, home, everything. President US doesn’t actually power make governor make vaccine available all. It’s directive, order. Because, well, President can’t give governors order. 
If governor state thinks it’s ready make vaccine available all, it’s governor make call, President. Can't give enough least front line workers across world prioritized every last American? 

What diverted 5% supply cause?

Shots arms fast possible best way end shit. (or press sec) said would case yesterday. It’s irrelevant. major metro areas certain states, things still shut down. Bars open like 25% capacity bar seating. Clubs closed. 

The people going still haven’t living “normally.” feed troll. ignore it, meander back cave. one article January talking referring to. According news stories reading time, Trump administration intended leave distribution states (not hard believe all, left almost pandemic response past year hands individual state approach disastrous pretty much always), ""no process distribute vaccine, particularly outside nursing homes hospitals community whole, really exist came White House,” Klain said NBC’s “Meet Press.” yeah lmao people thinking shits going back normal soon, like deluded people last year thought going go away summer  saw Bobby Knoxville exactly year ago now. Things started going downhill week later. can’t wait see brothers sisters 🤟🏻⚡️ knee jerk memes tho. 

Lock keeps us apart. large people good job staying isolated. like 70% country observed lockdown pretty emphatically.

Meanwhile lack lock going bring people together. Masks relatively easy enforce pretty effective. makes sense last restriction go. could see happening expect normalcy EARLIEST July/August. expect October normal I'd also cry October cancelled again. Like actually.  Texas many cities great, Austin poorly run. Many folks taking small day trips smaller cities get vaccines. finally opened people 50+ today major cities seem lot better. wish people would take mindset heart disease. shit kills 2.3k people day going long term. Lol who? nice leading world something positive again. made quite clear he’s talking It’s regional. I’ve dining since May 1st, Utah opened back up. some, sounds like foreign concept. kids school since August, absolutely idea many kids still Zooming it, conversation schools ramped last month two. read “fake fucking news” ready take pitchfork. 

Yeah time rest eyes. There's little blue pill way. Horniest summer time. suppose, mix match thing still holds true though, right? get Pfizer shot first, need stick Pfizer whenever second shot ready boys still get HPV spread it. potentially lead related cancers men nearly often everybody get vaccinated limit spread. Thank you. felt bad one younger ones there, I'm eligible, I'm taking it. I'll take fall booster shot I'm sure going coming know many people currently pregnant! even one them. Granted, wanted/were trying baby long time covid actually put attempts hold bit seems like know least 10 people due summer. Wife left week half ago. Ima need good summer. didn’t answer question. end goal vaccinating vulnerable, want cautious guess fine, want vaccinated? point go back normal? isn’t sustainable lifestyle, ruining people’s life experiences, jobs, dreams, friendships, etc. going back normal priority. Oh fuck off. 😎 sometimes forget i’ve adult 13 years.   So? said Gen Z, would say youngest Gen Z like 10, won’t flooding clubs bars?

Millennials go end 96. So...there’s plenty 24-30 year olds going go out. 

And live area like this, Gen Z college like 97 98 also living cities high numbers flooding clubs bars. Can't remember source, quite sure Porriño already made Spain they're waiting refrigerators. Yep - first week April end second week post vaccination final member family bunch people (who also infected gotten vaccinated) cookout. glad done it. lmao sorry people paid getting first. must sting. Petri dish inside sterile environment. real world always going mess. 

Yes every adult isolate four weeks completely stopped virus able take hold would over. would happened everywhere planet seen isn’t anywhere, Auckland recently went back lockdown case there.

There ways could mitigated better scientists assume would behave perfectly flawed logic well. Ummm know!! article said ""everyone May"" availability 18 + only. want 16-18 age group eligible (Pfizer obviously) well.  Context: foreigners South Korea's largest province, Gyeonggi Province, ordered receive diagnosis test COVID-19 March 22. fail get tested, fined 2 million 3 million (~$1761 ~$2642) forced reimburse provincial government testing, investigations, treatments related spread involving them. 

This order **not** apply Koreans, unless employ foreigners. masks, lockdowns (which really US). risk that, suppose perfectly executed lockdown, virus went away month. Everyone starts screaming whole thing hoax. thing masks. ""The virus gone, need masks!"" There's entire app it. source story Biden White House: hardly unbiased source policy failures successes immediate predecessor. truth, usually is, [is Trump administration certainly made mistakes, concrete long-term plan. current vaccine rollout (by current mean one still happening March) still largely state-run framework built blueprint Trump administration laid down. vaccine administration starting pick Trump left office: daily rolling average vaccine administrations slightly million inauguration day.

By accounts within Trump administration, Biden regime done better job. also benefit inheriting least partially-formed rollout plan.

I guess overall point lot clear failures criticize Trump administration. need stretch comparisons poorly hypothetical Trump rollout would going mid-March. scroll past Fauci comment. 

I believe CDC could shutdown airports travel general done so. crazy think 1-2 months ago thinking 'Yeah, June we're lucky', seeing news exact opposite excited May 1st. numbers looking good.

Thanks reading novel. Please explain mRNA vaccine, instructions make one spike protein, harmful infection replicates process, instead making spike proteins, recreates entire virus body fights off?

Please explain virus known kill people, cause long COVID, less dangerous vaccine tested 30,000 people deaths significant side effects, used 90 million people US alone, serious side effects anaphylaxis idk, 10 people per million? 

Please, say “oh I’m worried 2-10 years line,” explain vaccine produces spike protein, would likely cause long term effects virus itself, total 29 proteins? Who’s foolish, fool fool follows him?

There's half dozen articles vaccine area far better basically amounts ""Biden sternly asks states already going do.""

Initial announcement Pfizer efficacy, Pfizer Moderna pushing delivery dates 200M pop May 31, $8B ARP covid vaccine deployment, approval first vaccine. could go on, actual good news stories made eventuality. What? wasn’t give order... sharing information plan, plan, Trump administration terms distribution, actually talk public vaccines educate [people] they're important health,” says. “The issue, however, going forward? yesterday, White House issued national strategy COVID-19 response pandemic preparedness, seven major goals, plan we've looking last year.” happy hour call yesterday former director former coworker, super texas conservatives, started spouting Pfizer Moderna vaccines safe didnt want take them, wanted see data. One even quipped didnt want become zombie, didnt want Bill Gates get kickback dose.

They completely ignore fact two foreign engineered vaccines actual impact infection rates US. Instead parroted Johnson Johnson vaccine true effective vaccine rushed like others  racist bigots think anyone younger millennial shit. Seems like screwed then. Could easily put stop time. sad see EU anti vax. hope change minds soon get back normal. maybe party isn’t important. instead people prioritize safety well-being drunk dumbass. I've got bridge sell perfect bill health twenties think getting vaccinated May I’m vaccinated yet parents (both got Moderna shots last month) okay visit home weekend? Haven’t home year. Miss them. credibility Scientific American entirely irrelevant. actually bothered open article, see linked two things:

1. Oxford-AZ: CDC: want ""keep listening vaccine manufacturers"" suggest click first link above. 

&amp;#x200B;

I horse race, Scientific American article actually cite legitimate sources. Perhaps, now, correlation vaccine blood clots established. ...for asking people gather pandemic? Come on, man. mean manufacturers chose 21-28 day gap interest time, say don’t want anyone going cover asses?

I think I’ll listen studies massive sample sizes basic fundamentals immunology serological response multinational corporation clearly applying pressure various countries globally dangling vaccine deliveries front them.  Many people find comfort staying home complaining. It’s become identity past year. 

Listen science, science says things getting better, revert deeply rooted priors. unclear mean Chinese vaccines difficult produce.

It's clear mean. disagree. understanding production process way expensive whole inactivated virus vaccines. R&amp;D mRNA vaccines must expensive, production simple inexpensive. least mRNA itself. Lipid nanoparticles bit difficult, overall, mRNA vaccines definitely less expensive produce. NYC require hotels city collect paperwork/participate enforcement? baby eating happen? told moment ago. There's still possibility used, known sure stay ready planned paid for. Biden said: surplus, we’re going share rest world. We’re going start making sure Americans taken care first.” shops manufacturing plants need help signs everywhere can't get people work another problem addressed here. Wages need go up, can't keep people unemplyment forever, shit getting hand.

Seems solution understaffed employers staring right face, must reluctant accept need offer pay get labor need. shops manufacturing

are throw away job

That skilled labor. employers wages offered they’ll find workers willing trade labor it. won’t they? Yeah went teaching feet day virtual teaching full year. got standing desk compare circulating around classroom walking campus...I call Covid+19 (lbs) Europe fucking badly (sans UK)? mine yesterday Edinburgh mass vaccine site certainly look like working anything approaching capacity. dozens cubicles set up, total three people front me. building seven minutes. seems rather absurd... You’re sad. He’s stutter whole life, it’s well documented. go back watch videos 20 years ago. stutter That’s crazy. Everyone 16 eligible Oklahoma. people power saying last far beyond date people want vaccination get one? Biden take vaccine shove demented mannequin ass. many people ordered vaccines UK? Maybe rest world too... probably increase due schools reopening

The crucial bit hospitalisations deaths keep falling Biden better president trump far.

under trump 500,000+ dead corona virus, failed soft coup, failed insurrection, lost house, senate, white house, impeached twice, investigation everywhere fucking crook, utterly destroyed economy.

under Biden massive COVID relief, everyone vaccinated May 1, re-opened ACA registration funded many people get cheap healthcare, stock market up, economy poised take off. 

2021 President Biden going rocketship. we'll remember awesome summer utterly shitty last four years failed, criminal, un-American president. FDA allows 600k Americans die heart disease PER YEAR, allowing garbage put shelves. That’s 600,000 yearly. vaccine take minimum 10 years develop. think I’m gonna take FDA approved vaccine took 10 months mass produce? You’re fucking dizzy. like grandma hates waste still habits effects Great Depression family. stuff runs deep, country still loop mental Healthcare emotional trauma. resources teaching people emotional intelligence cope things like this, many keep stumbling forward best without understanding do. like 3rd dose? staying inside forever lol? Sounds like fun life.  yet linked deaths.  far getting around 50000 shots done per day tops maybe less. takes one year around 18 million single shots. need two three years adults. about? countries contracts private company. They’re paying whatever agreed price on. one asking give anything away? doses, reduction 54%.

For Pfizer reduction transmission 94%. I'm probably misunderstanding you. buy squat stand not? pandemic different one cant controlled worth it?  can't? Look charge. Totally makes sense.  Regarding conventions- keep rolling booth fees next year. I’ve gotten refund one con that’s cancelled twice think it’s probably dead. Refunds offered 50% only. fall planning operate normal think, everything changes fast things get cancelled last minute it’s hard say. Mask usage likely common on. don’t think “scientificamerican” credible. I’ll keep listening vaccine manufacturers comes products. keep reading trash. Maybe you’ll take trash vaccine get naturally selected! Terrible decision business owners. apt username have.  people understand efficacy Vs protection hospitalisation. Ahh alright, happy worked things out! Eligible - but, presuming doesn’t account issues distribution? wondering realistically given poor distribution plans states, us still anticipate vaccine much later year? 

Or, improving distribution also part Biden’s plan? (I’m hoping so!) countries now: ""Waaaahhhh! America solving problems us? America banning exports? 

Well basically cheating, Europe produces vaccine export massively slow distribution. said, European perspective. way US seems normal way EU it.

Shame though came facing ""foreign"" threat Humans, really band together like would hoped. purchased Pfizer vaccines right vaccines private company that's manufacturing US? People recommend taking work second shot, I'm even going worry it, I'm taking day off. feel like know socialism good?  like states big stockpiles vaccines holding limited release increase buzz demand.  States currently prioritizing different ways, 19 year old healthy people become eligible May 1 (instead whichever later date particular state previously directed), potentially get way vulnerable people waiting get vaccine?

You know, June figured bottle vaccines without losing Biden. many people still cluelessly claiming winter ""because fauci said so"" reason hesitant getting vaccine don’t want go back work one EU wants AstraZeneca vaccine. new vaccination plan include AstraZeneca. oplyser en pressemeddelelse, den nye vaccinationskalender er uden AstraZeneca-vaccinen.   det er vigtigt understrege, vaccinationsplanen vil se bedre ud, hvis vi ved revurderingen uge 12 genoptager brugen af AstraZeneca, skriver styrelsen. 

Translated: Danish Health Authority states press release new vaccination calendar without AstraZeneca vaccine.   important emphasize vaccination plan look better reassessment week 12 resume use AstraZeneca, agency writes.

Source: [TV2 mean Russia caught several countries hacking vaccine research. They’ve also caught U.K. spreading tons misinformation regarding Oxford AZ vaccine, probably vaccine diplomacy. shouldn’t praised anything. Peace mind biggie well Basically this, I'm considered essential never got unemployment. managerial salary like 400 week best area, even halved unemployment boon. would still making unemployment deal public. making extra 600 +200~ish early would able decent car would actual savings that's almost twice usual pay. 
 
I support national 15$ minimum, making equivalent 11$ hour manager ridiculous. Wages need higher needs targeted.  roaring ‘20s part deux No. trying get actual information there. always suit people's agendas.

We've hitting equivalent 500k cases day Czechia time (when adjusting population) get world governments lot people believe science. Still long way go vaccine adoption. Awe remember able kid allow go school... good old days. parent's boat. actually said going get it. 1 year old (born March 2020) seen whopping 3 times due taking COVID seriously would like. one tell live lives, today said either get vaccine continue see granddaughter. signed get first dose next week.

I sympathize mother friend. Unfortunately live time people think diseases safer vaccines. "" cases women 30s typical mild-to-moderate flu-like symptoms become severely ill require hospitalization. one case, two variants identified circulating Brazil since beginning pandemic. ""

Interesting, would've thought they'd pretty rough condition essentially two forms covid attacking body once. hope they'll recover smoothly. kind true, current vaccination rate among 16-18 pretty low compared demographic (something like 30%) Yea think I'm smart enough understand I'll keep trying. comments blood disorder stuff? dad especially nervous stories he's focusing recent blood clots summer. Ask Polio vaccine knows who's negatively effected negative way. Odds got oblivious people live iron lungs still muscle disabilities. amazing many people vaccinated kids life altering diseases still think vaccines bad 50% new cases 0-19. See peak 53.6% cases demographic single day. see particular stat? Source could partnered Bayer like Curevac. news also Apple building iPhones Amazon Foxxconn. guys even look worldwide stats huh? S/O hospital overseas l regretting spending money see her. Little know, checks coming way weeks later...

I also thinking could plane American attended church service NZ spread disease congregation l decided travel lockdown commenced. 

I still regret l plans get engaged last year get married year. 2020 ruined everything almost ruined relationship.

2020 like living suspended animation hoping catch COVID. Thankfully, area bad real cities like Houston, NYC, etc.  first time pandemic scientists scratching heads saying ""hey guys, one's doozy"" we're gonna find means afraid. new records infections deaths.

What records set regarding infections/deaths? reply, please remember meaningful statistics per capita, total ;) sub become garbage.  America nutshell. June 12th here. still asking guests wear masks thankfully also outdoor wedding. Looks like good! it’s *not* oncoming train

.....but *sure*? arbitrary. know like pew research center, AP, WaPo, Reuters, NYT, PBS, etc. use end 96. far common cutoff. 

But yeah, 96-97 kinda it’s thing. really millennials, really Zoomers. weird remember 9/11 lot 90s elements growing up, also Gen Z stuff well. It’s slightly arbitrary, lot thought going end 96 end millennials well. 

Real zoomers feel like high school college. Theres pretty big disconnect 25 year old grew 15 year old grew up. don’t know what’s agenda? Like 99 percent post negative/ doom gloom kind post. mean yeah get it, woods yet letting guard close pandemic could life death situation.

(per day, weekly average) still decreeing. meme? People lost year lives losing minds. Actually, makes sense since people young never young anymore. recent studies showing that’s case. Hey, also WA here. Contact local tribe’s health center. often doses destined trash looking arms for. Pretty much anyone get them, should. Membership required. Alaska opened 18+, reason think states refuse follow directive apologise, meant add /s I'll surprised done much sooner. Fuck it, followed guidelines year, took precautions, grateful able get needle arm wanted people know it. work spit clouds day, wasn’t worried people thinking wasn’t eligible candidate. anyway, what's stop executing code create SARS-CoV-2, MERS, aids? What's stop boostrapping complex antigen even worse? learn bootstrap real program possible damage malware could - benefit well-designed genetic program could - becomes immense. Even though supposedly intellectual Europe completely failing vaccine rollout? I’m both. 

BYOB , sunblock, bathing suit!  No, they're still complaining US. time, US' fault cozy big pharma. Well I'm hoping directs states make grocery store workers necessary frontline workers eligible first, otherwise impossible time trying get vaccine still forced come contact hundreds, thousands people day NY far higher covid death rate Florida. Dude, kid not, work I've seen two different people PULL MASKS SNEEZE OPEN AIR. 


Their stupidity took surprise, stood dumfounded also enlightened we're shit fucking position regards deaths virus. pendulum swung sub it’s honestly weird. Obviously things different time prior.  Vaccines rolled it’s process.  uneven ongoing process.  I’m PA rollout hasn’t best. lot old people initially left dust mean lot.  started reaching sign elderly neighbors 2 weeks ago NONE first appointments.  hard work (and dumb luck) got first shots days ago 3 appointments within next 7 days. 

Aside congregate care settings lot vulnerable people still beginning process becoming protected. lot people also essential workers go dr appointments various things.  

Israel’s vaccine rollout pretty much comprehensive aggressive one thing seems show work way vulnerable cohorts people’s actions become loose understandable.  case load decouple serious outcomes.  

But people claiming “mission accomplished” sense far began see uptick cases due likely people loosening up.  

These next 5 weeks extremely important.  one thing pandemic shown never doubt ability eff something up. anything make nervous? people insanely partisan disturbing. let pesky reality get way all. covid vaccine it’s actually vaccine experimental mRNA biologic. survival rate covid 99.7%. studied long enough even consider taking it. avid mask wearer social distance . studied “vaccine” already 400 deaths associated mention long term effects come next months. thanks. one United States thinks 21 age adulthood Redditors thinking ahead really go hand hand look purely percentage population, Texas guess low, they’ve administered shots states, barely behind CA NY also massive snow storm de-rail everything least week... saying toddlers plenty capable getting around obstacles near magically creative ways. bribes work, that's great. saying people complain fears difficulties parenting. chose health scares pandemics consideration 21st century that's lack foresight can't complain about. grown adult, maybe even two, able clever 3 year old. EU seems hell bent stuck lockdown forever. People don’t like told right thing. Death rate kids almost zero Cuomos front yard Sounds like might feeling vaccinated. Yes Biden magical happened without him... think would busy golfing tweeting get way. attention span 1 year old. 10 years stimulus forgotten everyone still poor. least guy policies actually put America work lowered cost living state vaccine plans completely playing ear.it definitely happen right hard talk issue.

Not everyone shares opinion masks literally burden whatsoever. go mass gatherings, concerts especially, spectator. social aspect it, lots people, masks barrier communication.

If want wear mask, means go right ahead. required wear mask, I'm definitely person America enjoy that, I'm definitely person America vote wallet attending. summer's event season one mandatory masks, I'll save money watch sports bar require them. get friend (who available Sunday noon) make appointment you? exactly excited see news. 

We *knew* vaccines would prevent transmission. work! 

but yeah, naysayers kept saying ""well know yet."" ""we know long term effects."" blah blah blah. types. 

now yet another study smack with. state plans constantly shifting, trust people lack critical thinking skills... Blitz, odd sexual fetishes next decades. oral liquid polio vaccine used developing countries now, weakened virus extremely rare cases cause actual paralytic polio. I'm happy you!!!!!!!!!! Haha, got coffee friend probably around March 5th 2020. talked COVID told definitely overreacting, fun ongoing bit shit escalated year straight like “still think overreacting?” Paystub/W2/company letter. government id. want to. mandate lol

I lived Korea two years. He's anything... Hey states May... Sure getting vaccines fast supply have. Well, two researchers seem agree side-effects less frequently reported older patients - assume case. bad didn’t provide citations.

They also immediately say “These side effects minimal short-lived”


Long story short - get shot, tell friends stop wimps get shot. get sick, I’ll send fucking pizza. state said take months everyone get vaccinated. who’s telling truth? Lmao serious? Us Gen Z can’t even afford right now. strictly personal anecdote ..... March 11, 2020 big day personally. accepted new job would take Denver Los Angeles, new company, new adventure.

I made acceptance call 5 PM MT.

Within 2 hours, NBA shut down, travel Europe suspended, world began shut down.

One year later, I'm still working remote Denver.

It's difficult year. lmao can't fuckin wait RemineMe Two Weeks! year. really funny introducing one fairly straightforward problem--humans can't come physically close together--can upend society thoroughly. Cheers you, sub, we've lost. rational. would want burn something helping others around you? cardboard burning party burn delivery boxes we've collect?

Literally 64 million people are, most, two weeks significant protection. Things normal January they'll even normal May. False deity! Time take 1000 ft gold statues shrines him. Alaska made 16+ eligible, assume states  That's definitely already happening. Biden also said end May they'll enough doses every American, they're definitely promising both. Telling people thay we'll able ""small gatherings"" 2 months vaccine made available everyone might one out-of-touch statements I've heard whole pandemic. leadership Washington realize half America ""small gatherings"" since last summer? Throat cancer men. Michael Douglas, Jamie Dimon (Citibank? CEO) many cases throat cancer caused HPV years prior. guys never even knew it. sure didn't.  Don’t worry, think found it! 😂 may one! Lmao healthcare worker friends got vaccinated months ago. Odd troubles Pfizer Amazon. Moderna eBay lower end player Everyone's going eligible soon anyway time would take verify would subtract overall vaccination effort. He’s ordering states around? Last heard Texas cancelled mask mandate is! It’s exciting odd time, we’re pretty hyped. Looking forward go back work park. course I'll still masked times feel like give bit peace mind. bribes working better tape/mittens? people getting covid antivaxxers passed chance shot nobody gonna feel sorry anyways. someone throat cancer surgery radiation HPV even know years ago, good getting vaccine son. doc said cancer HPV said I've never it. said yes did, guys never even know often asymptomatic. damned sure surgery radiation it. tell everyone 40 get vaccine. way? vaccine doesn’t make immune, virus still spread mutate. CDC estimates *at least* 120 million Americans infected. Modeling Columbia estimated 65% places like North South Dakota upwards 50% sorts states. least close halfway US. I'd call pretty far road.  Nah, reading much it. take chances too. 

No hidden insult implication meant. That'd like insulting people vaccine trials.  Again, though, you’re assuming nothing ramps point forth, false assumption. Ontario open mass vaccination sites, we’re supply flowing faster ever before. assumption we’re still going holding current speed future plain wrong. wouldn’t surprised doubled current rate within month. wrong. Half cases group (if they're size) would 0% effective. Evolutionary constraints. limited number configurations spike protein take longer binds ACE2. options take away, fewer evolutionary pathways has, slower evolves evolve more. Needless say, yet. safe wear mask go Walmart interact hundreds strangers, yet safe wear mask carefully visit family holidays. Let's hear argument Joe Biden, couple months first term, tied worst president US history! Excited learn. 

Because vaccine quickly becoming political/tribal signal alongside actual medical use. Team Science^TM Evil Science Denier?

Just like masks. live NYC considered epicenter pandemic, least U.S. college related colleges system closed 11th afternoon evening, already gone home class morning. remember thinking bad, we'd back soon enough, I'd graduate.

Fast forward year later, indeed graduate, cum laude somehow, ceremony. gave us little online booklet diplomas months later mail. seen friends since last March. Four got sick covid, recovered thankfully. one friends high school posted dad passed away covid. One friends got sick kept pressuring hang them, they'd always wear mask nose socially distance. Even now, know better keep thing got sick first place, still pressuring see them. told I'm comfortable get vaccine.

I'm still waiting get vaccine, hopefully sometime May Biden announced he'll mandate states open adults May 1st. I'm tired staying room day. mental health shot. Online graduate school sucks tired time. mind wearing mask, want able go without fear potentially getting exposed shmuck decided careful. mom getting first shot next Tuesday, we're trying persuade grandma get it.

And I've put many posts before, anything, want fiance. lives Germany, we're horrified situation vaccines everything. We're hoping together fall, many unknown variables. We're trying take things one day time, often hard keep hope. he’s unvaccinated person work people feel unsafe. Chances anyone catching Covid extremely low. happen spread someone it’s likely symptoms would similar cold since they’re vaccinated. would virus stop evolving?

It stop evolving, vaccines reduce transmission viral load, it'll hell job evolving can't reproduce first place.

Bearing mind get exponential growth numbers people; number virions infected individual also grows exponentially, rapid suppression individual infections gives rise doubly exponential shrinkage. Why? attempted MA. failed. Watch Craigslist ads - want vaccine? Take grandma get vaccinated. $100 That’s due spike protein fights virus. parents could easily still go store pick pass it. They’re body protects doesn’t mean can’t pass long that’s cdc recommends spending time others vaccinated. can’t,

Ok could stopped there. We're running low people, vaccinating confirmed recovered (and sick) 28% population 0-16's. rest lazy, extremely cautious anti vaxxers various degrees slowly coming around.

84% adult population least 1 shot recovered.

Among non Ultraorthodox, non Arab population 92% least 1 dose recovered. Making everyone eligible vaccine mean everyone *has* vaccine point. example, lot places staging rollout risk factor - starting old people, people risk, medical personnel. ""Make everyone eligible"" means ""stop prioritising at-risk people"", ""everyone's done"". source would nice, yes, something reputable. live high rise San Francisco view probably see larger group people entire population Iceland. Point is, isn’t really “huge achievement” there’s Icelanders. 

Also, aren’t 100% Icelanders planning getting vaccine? Reddit told America anti-vaccine idiots..? 100% agree, cold hard science facts less likely appeal people, they’d get vaccine without arguing they’d already understand readily available science. saying “hey look understand you’re worried get that, consider paying forward like others us past” effective response. Lol yeah that's definition Redditor Comic con cancelled tho went two similar sized weddings September 2020 country. worried bit first one know got covid. think quickness released little trial data supporting effectiveness safety crippled enthusiasm.

Thanks much :) One thing tell there's going **lot** pent demand travel attend events over. Fauci concerned 10 minutes fame crisis winds down. Nah ton places still open pandemic evidence. countries said they've done caution investigated. far, evidence. People cruel. Imagine wanting see newest member family wear mask...I legit understand people selfish. See get administration cares call hoax. get actual results. start almost entirely scratch now, real guarantee life much better

As callous may sound.. think reality pretty much norm lot people. (as fair unfair may be.. kind life is). 

I know myself.. thought figured 20's.. everything fell apart almost homeless. unemployed 1.5 years, sleep Brothers unfinished basement concrete floor sleeping bag rebuild life. 

I spent 10 years rebuilding things.. near end 30's thought figured out.. everything fell apart (outside control) .. again.. spent long period time working 2 jobs paying nearly 30,000 CC debt rebuilding life mentally physically stable. 

it's 10 years since that..(now getting close 50years old).. Corona virus best try kill (March-April last year spent 38 days Hospital, 16 days ICU Ventilator fighting life) along long road Rehab. 

I'm getting back feeling 100%.. I'm thankful I'm alive. job like,.. we're dramatically under-staffed under-resourced (and due budget constraints approved overtime etc).. crushing weight starting get me. (especially upper-management saying ""We're talking it"".. we're far far past things needing ""talked about"". Shit needs start changing. Hire f'ing staff !.. 

On bright side,. we're alive made it. Possibly learned things strong much resilient be. matter world throws us hard might seem,. it. Yeah, according NY expecting something along lines late summer/early fall. Yes let's let big business get even medical history already are. person Bs incredibly selfish shitty decision force person continue live stressful life, person everything right year? answer question, died. lot people died. People afford move away immunocompromised parents, anyone else take care them. died man. want able train martial arts without wearing mask. I'm fully vaccinated, there's medical reason to. Americans lost many privileges result pandemic, there's excuse continue depriving people immune freedoms. people took chance new vaccines

I disagree phrasing. We're ""taking chance"" vaccines. large trial studies, hundreds millions doses given around world, demonstrating clearly safe effective. support this, realistically think legally enforced. vaccine given Emergency Use Authorization, meaning FDA cleared clinical trial testing still undergoing. can't force someone take experimental drug condition benefit. enjoy covid selfish. USA democracy, single person charge 8 years series checks balances place make sure get powerful. Newspapers media allowed publicly call lies manipulations without fear reprisals screw things badly people get rid install someone else.

Yeah that's says textbooks. Reality quite different pretty much China publicly criticizes parties policies disappears.

You watch much TV. Honestly, basically case state already. vaccine sites taking time tk validate someone eligible 1B people signing regardless eligibility getting vaccinated. Might well open thing make sure doses go unused. really is! traveling started remember whining friend missing house... imagine different lol true. Latest data showing asymptomatic infections prevented 94% efficacy. trying insult me, almost feels like compliment. far first person imply I'm going catch COVID reduced lung capacity rest life religiously follow every CDC guideline. can't, mean segregating population based vaccination status. think right tell poor minority communities get even less privildeges vaccinated, chances they've told bad information vaccines. works. protected. not. could still carrying Covid still spread him. He’s young might get symptoms turn spread someone else immunocompromised. 

The vaccines prevent hospitalization 100%

Pfizer Modern prevent symptoms 95%

JJ prevents symptoms 65-85% 

None stop anyone infected Covid 19 think ""culturally"" acceptable drop masks restrictions Walmarts Home Depots etc. allow shopping masks?

""Culture"" deciding factor.

Optimally federal agency NIH, CDC, public health service would publicize national success criteria ending pandemic emergency restrictions, progress would measured said criteria achieved. sure that's happening though. Laughs don’t either one reading comprehension language one. single one. Someone proudly boasting getting vaccine total selfish asshole. Full. Stop. unmentioned amount jumped wall(s) West Bank gotten shot's East Jerusalem locations. reported, admitted to, MSM. single sentences articles stating one refused given vaccinations locations. he’s moving good job he’ll good insurance maybe, Person around immunocompromised parent, least without taking precautions. Person parent living since March 2020? Furthermore, living since beginning lives?  bunch friends trip Vegas planned. cancel reschedule 3 times last year. us fully vaccinated trip! gonna awesome! Haha that’s feel nurse. I’d take easily 50% pay cut anywhere I’d want live lmao Yes. Monoclonal antibodies future. Probably due massive increases testing done schools wife works pharmacy. got 100 shots J&amp;J give week nothing scheduled come next week. There's still potential that's held back due vaccine supply. Retired people still interact public need go store doctor whatever necessary. Since higher chance dying catch really get 20 year old grocery worker even latter exposed more. Enjoy mask social distancing. USA could export stuff anywhere. mean asymptomatic? so, taking vaccine necessarily make asymptomatic. Taking vaccine reduces probability becoming infected. However become infected still possible may become symptomatic asymptomatic. said, new data form Pfizer suggests suggests vaccinated, vaccine decreases asymptomatic transmission 94%

In short, take vaccine. felt sick one day second dose. it. stayed bed watched movies, went work next day. 

I'm almost 3 weeks past second dose, feel absolutely fine. Every person know gotten second dose gone similar experience. downside politicizing whole thing ramming peoples' throats year. whole ""even vaccine safe"" thing political signaling point. science clear months people still refuse give up. thing EU gets lot shit even considering restrict exports companies failing greatly deliver promised.

At time US banned exports. no, ""the US buying rest us"", rest us able *purchase* vaccines made US, money.

Either EU right stop exports like US has, nobody right stop exports. Choose one. know, responding person Pfizer's efficacy figures. 😂 Let’s Go everyone. get doses moving. went small horror fan-con two weeks ago masked socially distanced. smaller ones going trouble, think big ones survive there's much stake, especially money bring host cities go bust.

I tell weo many happy people con once, cooped home everything went well. issue forces company make work remotely instead people could abuse future. good deal, would shortage people taking deal. Must sweet deal. market speaking, employers might eventually listen. 

Or wait temporary relief measures expire months make reduced productivity meantime. Economic socialism non-economic individual liberties incompatible theory. practice, there's pretty good chance someone identifies socialist also thinks certain individual liberties restricted collective good. Damnit. Worried PR consequences here.

Italy quite bad France, still pretty bad, terms patch population ideas vaccines.

Which crazy, considering best scientific minds routinely come Italy.

Hoping hugely impact things speedbump along road getting population taken care of. talking figure. Israel's new study showed 2 doses Pfizer's vaccine provides 94% reduction transmission. voicing interesting difference big first second dose. Yeah even though matter much tbh glad get vaccine crossed list. 
I think may depend stock change (unsure often get delivered) explains 4 weeks either way. Sadly lot businesses, bars, restaurants, hangout places closed due lockdowns going reopen. permanent closures. people going hang at, Walmart?

Those small businesses need government support, promise (being forced close without support, big businesses lobby government close) never happen again. ...and black American’s excuse? exhausting. source? Highest estimate I’ve ever seen 30% USA. Thank posting article.  Shutting pretty much 100 percent catholic country holiest weekend year? That’s great idea vaccine yesterday. couple grade 3 side effects (headache/fever) lesser ones, I'm starting think would better getting disease quarantining. Hope works friend. accept anecdotal thoughts either us? 

Here good article good Yes. Moderna 16 up. Pfizer 18 up. sure J&amp;J. Open everyone May 1st hopefully.  great!!! Unvaccinated people (for COVID) shouldn’t allowed cruise ships, planes, etc. don’t right comfort fun. I've read lots this. People saying can't find appointment. Let start saying healthcare workers absolutely vaccinated immediately employers. Makes sense fend regard, especially busy are. 

That said, 

I've quite active various corona-related reddit threads. two instances week people said exactly said ""can't find appointment."" zipcodes literally able find appointment 30 min away 30 seconds. 

I know situation are, many parts country currently excuse young professional internet access transportation able find vaccine slot (if eligible) acquaintances. takes legwork persistence, actually quite doable. 

Between wife I, able help 15 friends &amp; family eligible appointments quite easily. found slot sent link website instruction ""Hurry!"" Others, older less techie, wrote info booked slot ourselves. 

It's rocket surgery. need tips/tricks share colleagues, let know. I'm at, originally giving guidance group Q4. they've deleted expected dates anything past next month (I already got mine though vaccination site volunteer). got mine ~21. sucker felt like jello heard that, that's really interesting! think Pfizer's completing upgrades factory, that's also part reason increased supply. We're also start receiving shipments Moderna, sometime quite soon Novavax (which building factory UK) likely receive regulatory approval. countries now: ""Waaaahhhh! America solving problems us? buy vaccines distribute us? dare take extra work compensate horrible COVID response! America hoarding REEEEEEEEE!!!”

What fuck talking about? export ban ban USA buying distributing vaccines countries lol. ban exports. one almost groundwork done, vaccine used today, within weeks. explain quick develop saying someone LITERALLY TALKS hiring managers every day, U.S. Warehouse, manufacturing, anything right around min wage little above. can't find people willing work.

Sounds like need respond market increase wages then. Oh nice trick. guess Pfizer then. opposite actually. alaska Oklahoma vaccine available everyone. states still 65+ 16-64 specific health conditions plus states 50+ argument '' Europeans lazy, problems AZ vaccine fault AZ produced faulty vaccines'' know ridiculous sounds? wtf, already got shot gonna go weeks second shot. trivial California, what's wrong state? maybe part less needing job industry? reality is, people working jobs got let got whatever making almost much money sitting home unemployment would went back job right waiting them.

No one making much minimum wage making money sitting home instead working. repeating false talking point. can't get second dose October want maximum protection

Worse, considered vaccinated receive second dose. Getting second dose October mean effectively remaining locked throughout entire summer. “Oh feelings hurt, let’s let people countries die try feel superior again” Well push hard Texas we've got lot stupid running state. realize literally every vaccine, right? ""Oh well someone else came vaccine previously, therefore x"". stupid argument make. Hey, states banning AstraZeneca blood clots another hot product: cigarettes PR campaign get everyone poke needs run serious overdrive. lot people want shot form, need convince safe, highly important get.

If Fox/OANN run multiple endorsements obtaining vaccines, would huge help. Absolutely, work school. Working person helped mental health tremendously it’s also sucked feel “radioactive” wfh friends. I’m sorry. frustrating. I’d keep checking Walgreens every morning 6am release new appointments. mom 42 days post first dose get second. I’m sure Walgreens get new shipment soon keep checking. got vaccine NFL stadium city. place runs like damn factory. pulled 4:55, confirmed appointment 3 minutes, answered medical questions, got shot, within 10 minutes. longest part waiting 15 minutes see needed emergency care reaction. without leaving car. tell 2nd dose schedule. Three weeks Pfizer, four weeks Moderna. - $600 checks sent

1/4 - Biden promises $2000

Snopes lying you. sugar cube probably taste, oral polio vaccine still used around world. NPR pretty good article puts takes oral vaccine. punch oral vaccine cheap easy administer. downside rarely serious side Seriously. stinks sour grapes. People shit america year. haaaaaaaaaalp please. Ignore current stulidity that’s great. delay actually administering it. hey, everyone’s eligible article says large number people skipped Sinovec appointment, appointments Pfizer held steady. Sinovec “side effects” people worried three deaths three critical illnesses. investigated. 

This competition looks like. High stakes, high reward. it’s long way down... Spf2000 me, seen sunlight year Seems like everyone letting guard now...

Fuck I’m going catch months vaccination make time staying home pointless. friend working covid testing center vaccinations well working pretty consistently 12 hour shifts. Colorado everyone lines cars drive thru style gets vaccinated. disregard time scientist made groundwork vaccines. Nice! many UK hoarded? Jokes them, India world's largest vaccine supplier pumping millions Oxford vaccines. super cold temperatures achievable majority world. get salty want, end cheaper, stable vaccines make sales. Funny mention science dragons paragraph. still grant right jump conclusions spot. brings hysteria table. 

Most people thrive open honest information whatever authority end create trust advice given. way describe people way majority behave. sensible concerned people part, spent somewhat longer time life have, building life experience. describing minority also find way spotlight DK, antivaxers people promoting forced vaccination.

I want government protect me, first foremost abide laws country. Government (politics) Health Authorities (science) separate, least nordics. personal protection look police, Health Authorities, justice system whatever services set run daily business country. Almost UK export ban name. plants Europe seem issues; AZ wanted make importing US, UK, India, none would allow exports. operators gym(s) worked want get shots? No, per testing physician, type antibodies tested positive come vaccination. basically EU cant produce anything own? shame due week said doses Moderna. got one unused second doses tell us guaranteed pharmacist made sound like simple ordeal finding second dose. we're like hopping around like everywhere they're supposed administering vaccines one doctor Methodist Hospital Arlington said give one dose FDA says gotta get place got first dose Walgreens saying need find somewhere else get second dose. hectic confusing get feeling ain't ones issues. said eligible- book appointment. Doesn’t mean you’ll shit then, book appointment get it. waiting lists months yet. Again, Indian hero country pandemic Coulda woulda shoulda.

Let introduce strictly followed recommended policy beginning still year later. true lot variables take account. hope understand really happened. Thats odd. love Ohio (Cleveland area) literally everyone know (locally) eligible least first shot. Everyone know yet eligible waiting Gov DeWine expand eligibility. 

That said, realize live echo-chamber. everyone associate similar mindset myself. 

The exception circle acquaintances former co-worker living Texas. wife retired, taking extreme precautions masking/distancing etc... waiting data vaccine safety. stance personally agree think unreasonable. Certainly anti-mask/anti-vax way. 
What's False

However, promises always made context legislation blocked Senate late December attempted raise per person payment $600 $2,000. $600 checks already distributed time Biden others entered office, addition $1,400 would **fulfill campaign promise $2,000 per person COVID-19 stimulus payments.** think it’s okay hoard doses vaccine you’re using spite?

I find hilarious quickly people go downright shitting Americans handling COVID begging vaccines completely shitting us “hoarding” precious vaccine.

What say, love seeing people say bring points up. “Thus far, 5,110,698 people, 54.96% population received first dose COVID vaccine. those, 4,068,374 people, 43.75% population received second dose well. Thus far, 5,110,698 people, 54.96% population received first dose COVID vaccine. those, 4,068,374 people, 43.75% population received second dose well.”

The number newly vaccinated hasn’t increased much weeks now. Israel running low vaccine?  Yes.  Yup, rural area too. Maybe Ohio sending enough vaccine rural areas? really know point. :( think they’re looking results vaccination uk. uk uses what, two vaccines? 

So results vaccinations Pfizer az lumped together. isn’t study specific vaccine. great news personally. 

The Republican governor state lifted *all* capacity restrictions restaurants, retail stores, churches.

I'm frightened it.

Yet, really much getting vaccinated since 65 special circumstances. phase 3 state still stuck phase 1.   looking mid June.

Now, least able take advantage calls vaccinations doses spoil....or able 6 weeks.

Six weeks lot better approximately 2.5 months. state? matters lot. fucking joke, it? far aware, J&amp;J vaccine made EU nicely exported US, AZ vaccines, get used least month would really help EU right now, exported?

The EU cleary taken advantage of. EU refuse exports countries, take willing give back slightest bit help. Health stonks! Eligible!  waiting list get it— tried booking appointment booked August I'm going stick initial statement speed development vaccine revolutionary unprecedented. No. allowed disclose personal medical history. HIPAA prevents medical providers releasing medical history. wanna throw up. 

This winging whining authorities reasonable proof yet. Yes. favorite part yesterday blamed America’s poor response “[mixed [“The risk United States [“There’s reason walking around Trump want people wear masks though? Lol Yesterday’s news Keep mind number people vaccinated people die unrelated reasons soon getting vaccine. good cautious investigate, reason suggest vaccine causing yet. timeline articles

12/30 - we’re getting $600

1/4 - Biden promises $2000. $2000 total. $2000. “At moment say variants contagious dangerous represent two thirds infections France”, Olivier Veran said.

He said new patient went intensive care greater Paris region every 12 minutes, adding know current peak epidemic would reached there.” Cos, dummies. Donate them, keep them, throw them. Orrrr burn breathe burnt plastic instead. None, many UK hoarded? None. Every dose used.

to accumulate (money valued objects) hide store away. think answer question ""Are people intrinsically good?""

Individuals sure, generically? think clue. I’ll say husband works fermentation microbiologist research broadly. outlook spring last year GRIM. Mostly cited production issues. Even effective vaccine could’ve taken years produce enough one single product entire world population.

That’s companies immediately started production vaccines trials even started. lucky science, technology, industrial stars aligned undertake medical feat. 

Good luck research writing :) can't figure ""California mom"" mom loves Indiana Jones temple Doom. Anyhow, come party? How’s fear? I’m afraid one bit. 

As I’ve said, already it. afraid I’m all. Reopening society save lives. Extended lockdowns result suicides. tbh Either car use public transport live really close work major cities. 3 increase costs. Also payments related car would hurt sf like people tend pay parking. Many apartments come parking cost extra it. parking fee alone couple hundred normally.

&amp;#x200B;

If live major city likely need car even more. car oklahoma quite rare things fairly spread public transport non existent. Going one major city oklahoma another years ago options bus/taxi (now guess uber) bus like 60 dollars one way 90ish minute ride. Public transport options horrid locations US nyc/dc two big exceptions cities moderately good. country coasts options without car suck. rounds pfizer received were. yet 3 months somehow still standard guidance policy. Eh, things considered making lifelong commitment raise care human being. Parents gotta parent. Don’t live fear tell Texas resident much changed area. businesses still require Anal rectal cancer too! mostly cervical cancer. OBL considered hero much Islamic world least villain. still liquid gets squirted kids mouths? kids one vaccines administered babies/toddlers, thought polio. sugar cube certainly would gone better! Summer 2021 bout movie. Old data. 2 week average included couple post snowstorm high numbers Fauci hand causing it. Get classic JnJ AstraZeneca.

I feel like new MRNA vaccines really freaked people newness (me included), qualms getting old school liquid arm.

Know heavily future science leery family members feel (in Canada). We're cool old school, even less effective. overcome it, that's there's better people world that's thing, taking chance. pay it, invented different countries different healthcare systems sectors. Sorry dysfunctional, predatory healthcare sector pay nose medicines rest world gets fraction price. must sting. genetic code Turing-complete?

Probably, yes. went outside last half year 2/3 palms upper 1/3 face exposed sun. really helps eventual body exposure. LOL I've two friends mid 20's end hospital COVID. underlying conditions. One ventilator month barely pulled through. He's sorts fucked COVID life saving treatment body.

The started get better dropped dead sudden brain hemorrhage. COVID fucks bodies ways we're beginning understand. Covid CAUSES pneumonia, along bunch bad shit, end killing you. mutually exclusive, claim kinda bullshit **now,** collectively year learn this, honestly embarrassing. got vaccines less year.

This truly amazing thing me. Realistic estimates year ago 2-10 years develop vaccine. Biden winning also Ever heard Pfizer? Honestly? Yeah. Trump hated COVID cause crashed economy election year much worse.

He'd lazy hell otherwise pass everything else Pence least competent probably interfere otherwise.

Would strong Obama/Biden/Clinton response? No, total shitshow. Obviously brought worst people failure covid always leadership institutions, culture decision impacts people can’t get vaccine, like children allergic reactions it. Funny you’re willing accept potential already documented long term complications COVID instead potential undocumented long term side effects vaccine well understood scientifically. agree, smokers, obesity, drug takers drinkers alcohol. I’m suuuuuuuper worried that. detected first case P1. isn’t time scaling back restrictions. well within federal governments authority 300 million vaccines made less two months go?

If enough vaccines opening appointments everyone makes really hard get appointment order people vaccinated goes science based first come first served.

What missing? Anyone FL 16 get one today one like 25 conditions, including overweight smoking. Basically anyone get one doctors note. Trump got Obama’s economy, Biden gets Trump’s vaccine. cycle continues. People already that. It’s numbers sucked much. chance people aren’t going balls wall 4th point. alone. still wipe groceries. brings small mental comfort, worth it. Sounds like everyone wants then. start working remotely next week hopefully good! 

Hoping book vaccine appointment eligibility bracket opens next week becomes bit difficult book city.  That's Scotty always came looking like miracle worker Enterprise engines. Enjoy playing second fiddle. guys fantastic vaccinations, keep USA!  Fuck Adam's Family virus Yeah, heard people counties able get shot weren’t turned away knowing luck, didn’t want take chances. I’m low risk wait, feel like golden ticket got confirmation email. 1400 that's something need refund. get 1400 later 2022 file taxes found got much get keep it. worked way last one true one. Toddlers take sock keeping shoe on. Bribes seem work better. Yay I’ll finally able get back gym. really good 2020 New Years resolution going Covid hit read Texas Covid Reddit Texas cases 10%. think Johns Hopkins source.  Honestly point it’s better go get it. aren’t verifying tiers. really risk I’d prioritize health arbitrary rules. fair, staying facility 15 minutes anyway, make sure there's adverse reactions.  We’re even halfway 65 city. There’s 4 major fuck ups know regarding mischeduling vaccines sites. zero faith we’ll get half many hands May people think 2022: no, like, totally isolate. Like twice. totally ;_; *We* shit *them* ??? short time period early secured supply frontline professionals, sure. Seems reasonable call made information available time. Considering public collectively freaked bought every piece toilet paper world single day seems like completely reasonable strategy secure enough medical workers able job releasing hell market. Yeah. seems like irresponsible order me. letting vaccines go waste actual issue, address issue. Otherwise, still using staged system end list  Fuck world. Username checks Ok? got second shot... Impossible skip line? see live outside Florida. True, without DPA, Merck may making vaccines.

As aside, trying recall Merck's name, found article gave vaccine January 25th. 5 days Biden sworn in. wondering long Merck deal works, guess answer. Where? vast majority states already 50+.

Something like 70%+ people 65 vaccinated 

Most haven’t choice Yep agree. April 30 target. think people watching next weeks see happens Texas Mississippi’s case numbers determine significantly lifting public health measures year reasonable. ""Biden"" Whoa, seriously?? knew could *cause* cervical cancer idea cancer almost always caused HPV. That's insane. 


I got HPV vaccine early 20s part clinical study, honestly know fact, makes much happier knowing got it. Yay vaccines!!! Yes. claim smoke get it. proof needed Damn spamming board hard tonight mycologist dude aren’t talking today. talking May. ramping production surplus. friend mine, mid twenties, ended ER COVID. started get better, taking oxygen.

Bam, brain hemorrhage braindead minutes. COVID fucks blood vessels ways still discovering. Anyone who's stupid enough worries virus paying attention. I’ve gotten bit tickled everybody trying like “ oh convenient everything getting better election” sarcastic way. I’m yes. Amazing competent leader make difference. people die COVID almost exclusively dying pneumonia COVID gave them. Hey, business gave TWO slices pizza! Give two weeks Nope, mom got second shot almost 37 days first, pharmacy ran wait couple weeks get back track. week behind. Pharmacist said state mess. pandemic brought absolute worst US culture

It truly did. Even over, think I'll able see many family members former friends way anymore realizing utterly entitled selfish become slightest personal inconvenience. Considering Texas fully reopened yesterday, we'll see long stay. Jaws! person currently eligible make appointment online post-May 1 slot, would much common sense one evening? Can’t still pass even you’re vaccinated tho? That’s exactly he’s doing. said approaching surplus stock it’s time get people. Agreed. think broke little. J&amp;J vaccine traditional vaccine made inert proteins like say. one, suspect, offer bit better protection disease they’re likely statistical tier. 

The mRNA versions, however, literally include section mRNA sent cells includes code needed teach cell Covid-19 spike protein trigger antibody production immediately. body doesn’t learn, it’s told. It’s difference learning Kung-Fu Neo Matrix. 

That’s everyone hailing mRNA vaccines fucking amazing development. One shot body knowledge medical researchers determined statistically necessary information disease. That’s efficacy rates high 90% range versus traditional vaccine’s 80s. 

Source: watched NOVA Frontline specials read like crazy I’M BORED DEATH TRAPPED GODDAMNED HOUSE FUCKING YEAR I’M LOSING G— ahem. read it. Thank listing reasons vaccine work. Again, believe vaccine long term eventually get it. 

Here’s areas concern me:

- Corporate greed pharmaceuticals companies. They’re benevolent beings - maximize profit. 

- Politicians political organizations trying quell public outrage. take chances lives score points. don’t think there’s doubt that. 

- supply chain logistical failures. 

- Cutting corners production processes satiate demand. absolutely possible likely. 

Again, nothing faith vaccines. believe wholeheartedly utility value. 

What don’t trust conjunction it. 

If sudden put trust politicians, healthcare companies, pharmaceutical companies drug gets us house, absolutely get vaccine. 

But think it’s right doesn’t make universal truth all. lot moving pieces think about. really think masks common *Summer 2022*?!! mean, definitely took seriously went Korea family there. worried like, whoa, spreading around real. Ironically, weeks later, realized Korea nothing worry (relatively speaking) US world shit. ""hoarded feelings."" US government bought rights early production ton different vaccine candidates hopes would pan out, often inflated prices. AZ fucked sense set test populations way would meet FDA requirements, we're seeing delay EUA approval. 

It's still expected approved next month two, doses we're talking likely offered Americans time. there's surplus domestic demand satisfied I'm certain US generous sharing supply trade partners, allies, impoverished parts world. lol always kind think ""Theo the-o great-o"" I'm pompous think I'm amazing anything name made lol everyone vaccinated safe

What sub lol OP study looks real-world transmission among 300k healthcare workers families. (Both first second dose.) It’s specific study population. pressure UVA. gotta show 7 straight days negative tests make NCAA tournament incredibly frustrating I’m sorry. Hopefully mega sites help move things along! People understand late, like covid agree, stubborn people drive it, impossible get rowing direction, making even harder control things. June turn healthy 35yo

more like august/september unfortunately easily worst comment I've seen reddit long time. Italy reporting three deaths well, three military members. described ""unexpected"" none risk factors. Austria reported two suspected cases blood clots relation vaccine, one nurse died another woman hospitalised.

Denmark far reported one death relation vaccine.

To seems like many ""accidents"" happening young people risk factors. fact happened people 65 also weird considering they're age group highest risk blood clots.

I bet money latest vaccine batch AZ fault due pressure EU produce sufficient amount vaccines. Der Anfang ist das Ende und das Ende ist der Anfang

covid season 2 Man yeah remember hearing feeling way! one ""Holy shit we're actually this"" moments EU placed limits monitoring exports select list third-party countries. also fine threatening play hardball UK AZ even though Commission's lack foresight led delayed agreement, given EU nations already finalized agreement months before, line wealthy Big 10 looks really stupid right trying cancel season last year. I'll look mass vaccination sites the. Rite Aid CVS option, no, using example tough actually get anywhere. There's also Giant Eagle, Marcs, Walgreens, etc. none appointments. local health department. There's also UH, Cleveland Clinic, Discount Drug Mart, actually waiting lists. mom signed three, calls far. Shut numbers made up, results would get conclusion.

Let's say survey 10,000 fully vaccinated healthcare workers, 10,000 unvaccinated, simplicity, assume one's vaccination status changed trial. HCWs partners spouses live with.

After 3 months, 100 partners HCWs vaccine tested positive. Meanwhile, 46 partners HCWs doses tested positive. means vaccine responsible reduction 54% exposure transmission, combined (i.e., HCW get infected, partner exposed or, get infected partner exposed, transmission).

That's probably over-simplification though, following reasons:

1. HCWs get vaccine duration study younger reckless? affect partners' occupations behavior? Possibly, hope would control that.
2. partners became ill necessarily catch HCW partners. Obviously HCWs likely exposed, likely pass closest contacts; account 100% transmission. partners largely unvaccinated, could easily caught virus elsewhere vaccinated partner home use situation. masks really suck want socialize. mind wearing grocery store wherever, I'm talking people wearing mask really sucks. healthcare costs becoming taxpayer burden, I'd argue even stuff ""doesn't"" affect still does. Drug addiction, obesity, smoking, etc. Even *directly* affect me, still affect financially emotionally.

We widen scope taxpayer-funded stuff actually. Continued mask mandates affect tax dollars used pay state's attorney general army lawyers fine non-compliant businesses ground.

Mask mandates affect personally businesses lose customers forced close people would rather stay home, socialize private, literally drive another state deal sanitation theater.

So I'm gonna stick said earlier. wanna wear masks forever mind wearing masks, go right ahead. try force onto everyone I'm vaccinated COVID longer issue, I'm going refuse comply. state like that, I'll leave. last year miserable me, people think mandatory masks stay forever, I'm going tolerate it. EU used less 30% doses AZ have. distribution acceptance problem point, supply. easier EU blame countries rather blame Matthew Liao, director Center Bioethics New York University’s public health school, said socioeconomic racial disparities vaccination campaign far would put certain communities disadvantage lack “vaccine passport” keeps individuals ***traveling, going daily life, getting job***.  want make sure everybody access vaccines roll passport,” Liao said. also suggested could motivator people get shot. “That could good thing need achieve herd immunity.”

This intended rolled time every American eligible. get privacy concerns... ""digital segregation?"" Please.

Many worked Covid wards closely pregnant women. also helpful helping understand goes various vaccines, tend safer pregnant women others. husband I, ultimately decided known risks Covid baby worse unknown risk vaccine.

A pretty normal reaction really. Atlantic podcast ""Social Distance"" recently Episode 109 titled ""It's Year"".. among things talk issue (how people thought happen here,. none previous ones did). 

It's great episode.. strongly recommend. poignant many moments starting episode replaying phone-call shared year ago girl reading sticky note wrote (and kept) ""stocking supplies 2 weeks"". 

There's also interview Fauci ,.. great segments. EU, specific, issues choosing play vaccine nationalism game, part play placing monitoring limits exports countries select list exceptions [1]. EC knowingly delayed agreement AZ made pact four EU countries would supplied EU member states. also happy threaten vaccine nationalism game realized UK better due earlier planning rollout strategies, although end necessary.

[1] I'm physiotherapist highest priority germany even get hopes up, unless get clear start celebrating we'll get another wave one saying unvaccinated people bad. they’re dangerous society therefore restricted things put others danger. Nice state they’ve vaguely said “sometime March” lower age like 60 55. haven’t super optimistic someone living Europe, US's responsibility give vaccines extremely rich countries simply they're inept. US's extra vaccines shared third world, EU. EU every chance make success didn't. African countries chance.

Let EU deal mess. Germany quite effectively organise streamlined gassing 6 million Jews, comes vaccinating population, suddenly can't figure out. Well, bad. not. world forgot deal made US WWII. exchange opening world free trade providing security countries they'll help fight USSR. 

The problem USSR gone 30 years we've moving forward inertia. world expected America keep honoring deal getting nothing return. America waking fact. political parties pro trade wars pro pulling back actual war.

Except far know US done this? gave quite large time distribution warn people. 

The EU place manufacture many vaccines companies producing majority production facilities within EU. EU presented attractive place produce vaccines, would surely financial benefit it. paid vaccine companies too, could let export filling EU orders.

And EU orders fulfilled like everybody else? understand gravity presenting place purchase vaccines from, blocking privates companies fulfilling contracts whilst also destroying relations countries? Unless contracts EU signed stated gets priority factories producing within EU only, don’t legal leg stand on. lung transplant team recommended patients get vaccine. covid mortality rate transplant population around 20%.

I’m way whatcom deal, appts hour away Snohomish. you’re going even try argue good faith, waste time. really would like know what's going AZ. feels like every week super negative headline it.

Is media fear thing actually something worry AZ vaccine? Minor clarification, fwiw ... Mayo Clinic says says mRNA vaccines may reduce transmission *up to* 80% folks *both* doses. 

The OP study looks single- double-dose reduction transmission among 300k healthcare workers, admits it’s conservative estimate. 

So seems like studies compliment other. It’s indeed great news. need high uptake get herd immunity want little coronavirus circulating around possible acquire mutations. *mind explodes* done ourselves. well, leaders fucked up

This nothing current situtation, totally different topic.

AZ wants fullfll contractual obligations (not EU also Canada) tapping US vaccine supply line, US rather hoarding vaccines banning exports materials.

This situation 99% US. Israel's data found almost protection 2 weeks, around 90% protection 3 weeks. ""After initial injection case numbers increased day 8 declining low levels day 21. **Estimated vaccine effectiveness pretty much 0 day 14 rose 90% day 21 levelling off.** cause initial surge infection risk unknown may related people less cautious maintaining protective behaviours soon injection.""

California partying entire time 🧢 AZ doses American paid doses...so are? Younger people soon surprise realize waiting lists exist vulnerable prioritized first. hope wait everyone wants one emergency use gets one, otherwise ""bottom"" list (say relatively healthy, relatively young people ""essential"" industries) millions people jump line front last minute expected. Means working. ""follow science"" actual strategy, even science still make decisions incomplete information. Exaaaaactly, lol. personal unprofessional opinion - yes. always level risk, also (other type of) risk seeing loved one. Agreed message feels pretty ""How affect ME?!"" itself. We're talking crazy pandemic us anything Syria. I'm saying matter I'm saying everything place right we're talking that. Im hoping Mexican cross least get parents vaccinated Everyone shits America need something us. 

It’s nothing new won’t stop. too. makes come squeaky lol countries critically need right now, see Japan time read thread yet.. also reflecting quite bit. mindboggling think ""every day life"" sort things people Jan, Feb, March last year.. (if any) us really realized dramatically (and irreversibly) lives change. 

I caught Corona sometime late Feb / early March timeframe. Started isolating around March 13. Conditions slowly deteriorated called Ambulance around March 23. spent 38 days (total) Hospital 16 days ICU Ventilator fighting stay alive. (16 days non-stop ""ICU Delirium"" nightmares caused heavy sedatives). 

I woke 12lbs lighter (due muscle atrophy). walk talk. various tubes still (including 3-port neck IV right side neck still scar from). Took 12 days go Wheelchair Walker hiking pole free-walking again). Hospital Rehab Unit forced gym workout twice day. climbing stairs Hospital (w/ full size oxygen tank) part exercise routine get stronger gain back balance they'd allow go back home (where live alone). There's 20 steps 2nd floor apartment.. remember first got home (still full size oxygen tank). .I could go 10 steps I'd stop.. wait heart stabilize.. taking next 10 steps. Getting home plopping chair,.. crying breakdown felt weird home. overwhelming feeling ""holy shit.. past 2 months awful bad dream ?""... 

Rehab physical therapy also long hard road. home nurses coming check blood-levels give physical therapy exercises 3 months. 2 medications (blood thinners heart-stabilizers) 6 months. entire treatment roughly March 23 intake April 28 release Rehab followups September. Friends coworkers supportive keys apartment would come (sometimes different people multiple times day) check give support. incredibly awesome. 

It's ridiculous think back all. I'm really great now. I'm Day 259 consecutively closing Apple Activity Rings,. get 365 award sometime late June. I'm averaging around 7.4 miles day walked (around 16,000 steps). I've increased VO2/Max 29 back May 2020 37 (hoping push 40's). I'm burning around 1,300 active calories per day (Active+resting, I'm totalling around 3,500 4,500 calories burned per day). I've sped walking pace around 2.8mph around 3.5mph. I'm currently averaging around 110 min exercise per day. 

I've also Pfizer vaccine shots now. 

It's super surreal sit back think everything that's happened March 2020 March 2021. scars memories things I'll carry forever. Hopefully good habits learned physical fitness believing overcome anything,. forever too. commenting mental health? person stops empathy others enough people life empathy them. Step away social media, news, opinions people never met. Surround people bring peace joy.

Might time take advice pinned comment. We've saved drunk driving deaths past year week. Vaccines great, doubt, 6 -7% could handled continuing wear masks social distance another 12 months worldwide vaccination. goal 100% eradication. Otherwise mutation could make current vaccines defunct we're back square one.

I'm worried everyone thinks war won. not. got ICU dying grandmother. family lot stress right now. saw headline President going order states open vaccine access May 1st. started sobbing ICU waiting room.

Guys, year f\*ing hard. covid known cause blood clots? Perhaps sort correlation people got covid want vaccine vs people blood clots? Gyms forcibly closed governments Europe. said fine production. Would adult strictly mean 18? I’m 17 turning 18 soon, time may 1. 18 days later. Lol shut fuck Let’s fucking hope so, rate Iowa, I’ll vaccinated around 2025  need them? enough doses way already approved ones. 

As Canadian, want AZ able fulfill contract signed them, US currently stalling. didn't. said consensus many could less five years. Please lie. sources gave mentioned previous research. Yes. research existed. modern innovations come previous research. stand shoulders giants. seem bitter argumentative. Bye again. Pointless, time could figure system enforce every adult eligible vaccinated anyway. 100m 100 days laughably easily goal thanks project warp speed. can’t wait see excuse never returning normal fearmongers come know certain vaccines reduce transmission. 22 got jabbed!

Good Biden representing Americans said would. Walgreens american company, British? Yes paid development. get first crack. makes sense. sure relates expensive health care system. always true. appointments set four weeks apart got Pfizer. pretty simple. Look amount vaccinated.

My assumption extent non technical leaders impact system, Trump Johnson messed things less EU did. Specifically US UK happy focus availability cost EU focussed cost per jab.

Apart cost human life cost saving per jab far less cost lockdowns restrictions stupid EU. India exporting AZ doses Canada. EU? said vaccine can't done 5 years, stated 1 year later done.

Martin Kulldorf That's weird. family Philly, every Aunt/Uncle (all 65 medical condition) received first shot Convention Center past 2 weeks. Good luck yours, give up. Shoot bad cold (only get sick like year) stuffed days... want go again. can't imagine something severe covid. Hopefully means fans Dodger stadium well. US ordered 100 million Novavax doses agree goal make covid something like flu. know also know usually harmless especially vaccine. could become sick days get better quickly.

Your argument assumes covid vaccines replace main safety measures: lockdowns, masks, social distancing. includes big IFs:

1. Covid vaccines developed reduce symptoms necessarily transmission. Recent news suggest Pfizer vaccine substantially reduce transmission well, excellent news. Moderna similar Pfizer, hopefully transmission reduction similar too. JJ vaccine? ambitious goal vaccinating everyone summer leverages fact JJ vaccines easier distribute (the storage requirements easier) single shots. 

On hand, lockdowns/masks/social distancing effective reducing transmission. need measures around children unvaccinated people months vaccines them.

2. Vaccines perfect (and need be). allow virus circulate among children reopening schools stop current safety measures everyone's vaccinated, knows kind R going have? 

3. Obviously variants dealbreakers. seems vaccines even effective variants. Without safety measures, may 2020-covid-outbreak-like outbreak again. New York lift quarantine requirements domestic travelers April 1st. much better vaccine exemption would arbitrarily applied vaccinated within last 90 days. 

So glad day coming American citizens travel freely within damn country. would reread paper journal, available pdf following chain links looking r/covid19, think category anyone vaccinated timing. even one date 3days prior counted. ...preestablished routes shipments specific locations actually established put play.  


...you REALLY understand logistics works you? Never worked warehouse, shipping/receiving. Isn’t calling FaceTiming socialization?

No.

Though question offensive. Again, year this. got sick odds much lower infect someone else, would need hospitalized, hospitalized would die. Susceptibility lower, hospitals peak capacity, treatment continuously improving. know would suck get sick make precautions pointless. Right, without money they'd let virus run rampant. BS. think scientists actually work money? there'd profit without IP laws? Give break. benefits everyone make distribute vaccine. ...did like, miss couple WEEKS ago literally worst winter they've ever had? 


Just saying... think mean AZ quality control, agree. think that's issue lies. boat, friend. boat. stress baking lot time last year, erased 15 points lost previous year. Working home same. bought exercise bike thinking could least peddle watching TV H.A.T.E. barely gets used. miss swimming. miss running, can't mask on. oh, miss group workouts! 

I've working person since June outlet blow steam get home, often grab drink eat something indulgent get lil shot dopamine. just...really need get vaccinated get back world. this, tired pants tight. deny there's puffed pride UK AZ shot, think EU innocent saints many would like situation. Macron's remarks alone horribly damaging terms instilling confidence need general population.

France one worst vaccine trust/acceptance numbers western country, president cavalier trying voice reason unseemly.  Yeah coz Biden gassed Nat guard beat peaceful protestors lafayette square photo op bible. 

Biden let half million die watch lying vaccine stockpiles.

Biden endorsed armed insurrection capital 
resulting five fatalities.

Just stop. 'Where live' 'Everywhere' dude. guess efficacy low they're giving second dose. Pfizer efficacy 94% stopping transmission 2 doses.

Give break. Back napkin math looks like 110 million people US age 18 willing get vaccinated. 

There 50 days May 1st. Number people getting first dose per day 1.25 million. stays constant another 62.5 million gotten first dose then. 

So that's 47.5 million still need schedule come May 1st, little 1.5 million per day would mean everyone first dose come end May. course another 3-4 weeks need second dose.

1) 1955, large batch polio vaccine contaminated live polio virus. 200K kids got contaminated vaccine 40K developed polio. However, problem caught within days. obviously particular risk applies live virus vaccines.

2) 1955-1963 millions doses polio vaccine contaminated Simian SV40 virus result vaccine produced (grown monkey tissue). virus known cause cancer animals, never shown cause cancer (or anything else) humans.

3) 1976, Swine Flu vaccine associated increase cases Guillain–Barré syndrome baseline 1 case per million 8.8 cases per million. causal relationship never proven influenza infection cause GBS higher rate this. GBS going occur, would happen within 3-6 weeks infection vaccination.

It's possible missed something, see anything like Thalidomide type event vaccine appeared safe first months years later sort horrible delayed side effect.  discussion going comment ""and almost year later""... much longer year. can't argue really poorly getting weird. Statistically, case increased clotting risk scientifically, plausible mechanism. Thankfully stepped try snuff BS.  Locking costs lives, too. social interaction loss employment recipe mental health disaster. increases suicides, addictions, overdoses, crime. That’s one issue. lockdown, people don’t go doctor get health issues checked out. miss cancer screenings, checkups, etc. leads preventable deaths. Kids can’t school sports anymore. gain weight, already youth obesity epidemic. Online education sub-standard. impact kids’ academic progress therefore future earnings, big impact health outcomes (unfortunately).

And that’s first world. third world, thankfully lockdowns rare, kids leave school likely never return. disastrous consequences developing economies. PA think sending many doses rural areas enough suburban/urban areas. It’s cluster sure guys enough doses everyone given currently approved vaccines. I’d surprised AZ used large quantities there. 

No one saying “give away” doses, let AZ fulfil contractual obligations. Canada 20 million order we’re waiting US let exported 🤷‍♂️ Well absolutely tracks learned fellow Americans: they're soft. send vaccine needed. That's right thing do, hoarding soft feelings. Heck yeah! A+ one, Mr. President problem local pharmacies appointments, offering elderly. county health department regulating healthcare workers, I’m sure teachers. 2 months either contact county spots literally filling 10 seconds, called department find dumped original registry fraud anyone previously registered again. little silver lining shitty 2020 US think BIG chunk population already gotten COVID. enough true Herd Immunity enough think good percentage ""high risk"" folks got it. ones threw caution wind never followed safety guideline could. COVID ripped bubble population less likely move quickly cautious sect people. it’s like need 100% adults fully vaccinated return normal, regardless fearmongers say. single shot still gives extremely good immunity, herd immunity, definite percentage, certainly happens well 100% fully vaccinated. Also, persons analysis assumes deliveries won’t speed past June, goes everything we’ve seen thus far. exactly California stubborn returning normalcy? Even Seattle, see people going outside without mask dined indoors relatively bustling indoor restaurant night. dad met father siblings dinner early December 2019. Every single person dinner came ""pneumonia"" week. dad sick even came home Christmas almost month later, still totally it. grandfather hospitalized days. tested negative flu every bacterial pneumonia doctors could think of.

And then, despite high risk, single one gotten covid. Even mom came it, Dad (who paper highest risk three us) totally unaffected. I'm convinced back then. Hysteria. Complete bullshit. way people lose sight bigger picture panicking covid (no consideration cost/benefit) vaccine deaths. Politicians perception, panicked erred side excessive caution bad perception worse bad results. 

Blood clots happening vaccinated people higher incidence general population. support restricting anti-mask, anti-vax relatives rest life. homebody, still dated, went eat sometimes, went bars occasionally, traveled, etc. 

That came end single day. feel bad service workers feel like pretty possible employers mandate indefinitely image purposes, sort like frown sitting working (even something like working cash register absolutely reason chair) _except me, I'm perfectly healthy diesease free!_

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s extra precaution taken normal circumstances timely approval necessary isn’t hundreds thousands people dying millions hospitalized. It’s rare find effects vaccines two months abundance caution long term monitoring try confirm. case lot evidence beleive covid far dangerous health vaccine every medical board, major experts, almost papers support idea vaccines effective safe across many different countries. I’m Matty V fan I’m sure vaccines immune disorder prevents getting vaccine, want announce condition company? fair make mandatory. separate incentive smarter fair. think still enough time. 2 million people getting vaccinated per day nationally. Also, even young healthy people start get vaccinated, remember also protect older vulnerable people. though? Everywhere read says gets immune system ready detect fight virus, doesn’t mean stops transmitting it. Actually yes customer facing. go skeleton crew let staff know it’s decision feel comfortable enough work they’ll spot it’s over, certain people chose step up. I’m complaining work. choice. issue people whining go bubble office work lot people front facing whole time. 

The fact don’t understand what’s essential aspects job show limited knowledge ill give quick lesson. work restaurant group house digital marketing. also work manger on-site week (my choice it’s front facing) part limited skeleton crew help us keep afloat. marketing side includes updates website menus due loss 90% revenue menu must cut back. Scheduled updates nice theres hour hour updates based vendor availability company even survived multiple managers different restaurant. Oh since I’m state California also closed twice takeout means late notification immediately transferring websites take out. majority restaurants closed dine there’s got someone update online profiles immediately people actually know business still open. 

Now digital management side things also update change POS frequently guest ordering online accurate menus order from. 

Oh let’s forget making sure we’re also sending emails reminding guests weekly open following protocol whatever county might guidelines. 

Not Quitting choice sure hell earned vaccine someone front facing managed help restaurant stay open whole time 90% business around us could starting rebuild. 

I’m putting pedestal earned afraid say so. kept 6 sites open lot work. Everyone else worked whole time forefront also put pedestal too. I’ve given even tenth glimpse year like coworkers. point judgy finger another direction. Yeah, schools open full swing fall hell breaks loose again.. legal restrictions can't happen one vaccines FDA licensed, right? us patiently awaiting time get may end one licensed anyway. everyone feels risk gets one don’t feel risk not, point restricting unvaccinated people going office?

 everyone safely take vaccine, instance 16 currently. vaccine 100% effective. Even 10% people unvaccinated, virus could continue spreading. can’t safely leave house stay home.

Everyone walmart without mask would disagree that. don’t force society adapt extremely small group people. 

That's quite literally U.S. cater special interest groups. 

An easy example abortion. 77% people want Roe v Wade stay place yet regularly challenges states. laws relating providing benefits exchange participating experimental drugs. Like said - support FDA fully approves it, where's line now?

Take COVID equation. Take drug X, still undergoing clinical trials, else can't come store Y. Here’s [BBC AZ: “There indication Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine linked increased risk blood clots, EU's medicines regulator says. said number cases vaccinated people higher general population.”

Edit: Spelling Nice see state this... hopefully puts pressure Govs like Gav Newscum stop making 1500 tiers holding back millions doses. agree can’t hold people summer. point two lost summers people won’t stand it. congregating summer leads cases/variants rising Fall second half original statement won’t true. Many experts believe summer good Fall better summer. Again, hope you’re right jumping joy say dead wrong. still took money advance purchase agreements, benefited hugely lightning-speed-by-comparison FDA approval process. FDA working normal speed, they'd still considering Pfizer shot today.  number unused shots stayed roughly constant. point might accept unavoidable logistical overhead - shots transit, actually ones fully delivered. No, also conspiracy want lift restrictions longer apply literally copy paste source say we've tested mRNA vaccines people before. I'd think actually background science, want review source yourself. Hi neighbor South, Oregon. Flubbed real id I’m sure don’t good answer that. Maybe would need approved list diagnoses it, kind application process doctor’s note? (The way Oklahoma medical marijuana- get doctor’s recommendation fill form apply card state Oklahoma) therapist actually recommending restrictions lifted. 

I'm thinking Hawaii. Maine going vaccinate people 40 May. changed timeline due Biden's new directive.    Americans (and assume people everywhere) simply understand risk.

neither though? equally risky everyone, basing risk risky people one foot grave isnt reasonable. Clearly logic isn’t strong point consequences too. People evolved views new DATA SCIENCE^TM become available like EXPERTS^TM masks last year. go away highly unlikely continue concern like today. likely move treated flu last decades. strawmanning? Genuinely, force covid vaccine allow obesity? Obesity much deadly way bigger strain healthcare system. problem people immune compromised can’t receive vaccine won’t strong reaction it. 

This reason lot school districts make kids get shots measles, etc come school. kids CAN’T get shot. read see harsh. Halfway article, author refers _another_ piece deliberately buried lede middle lengthy explanation thought right.

Ha ha ha like Charlie Kaufmann became journalist. Yes. You’re making determination net good humanity outweighs net evil humanity. what’s metric determining that? 

Those actresses could also still contribute society, couldn’t career Hollywood.  define “extremely straight forward decisions”?  He’s writing it’s coming end seems indicating it’s going last perpetuity better advanced masks now. I’m sure you’ll changing tune month it’s six months post clinical trial /s It’s necessarily something learned. boss thinks ready pick phone hours day instead 9-5. hate Exactly. Dude comments wild. can’t believe I’m reading lol. benefit talking about?

Let employer know got vaccine might required go back office. benefit? mean, I'd probably put group. can't get yet anyway though 6 months already passed time could. said would definitely group wants wait full approval. wouldn’t say it’s highly educated. Nursing school isn’t exactly walk park. Common sense good school doesn’t always go hand hand. buddy genius pediatrician, swear lacks common sense basic things. understand logical fallacy is? Probably based response poop don’t smell I’m going ask proof poop I’m shown smell me

Yea, that. said hardly controversial. you’re dishonestly partisan  sure hell dont want unvaccinated travellers allowed Europe anytime soon. vaccine passports good thing keep countties need tourism safe. want infect people country  Ok prove point, really. anyone's guinea pig. Animals people same. understand mRNA works patronizing trying explain detail moot. Ive worked genetics I've worked software engineering, enough confidence human intelligence design allow something like body without PROVEN long term results. Evidence ""well tried animals"" really convincing personally. want throw lot in, guest. Add dataset. I'll sit back wait make sure coast clear. apply controls producing vaccine surplus though? block competitors products.  got COVID birthday, around New Years - go ER cause body trippin' balls. cough weirdness finally went away weeks ago. boss hounding I'm coming back office. Says optics managers.

Bro - dysfunctional like 2 months? I'm supposed come back please someone sitting cubicle? I've also working remotely since November. capability/accountability issue.

Screw middle managers man, agree you. \^ This. Kroger locations employs people.

It's surprise would stores lower side productivity.

Publix invest employ people markets Kroger operates in. could apply logic covid...sure die... complications. mean ol' covie fault J&amp;J manufactured US? added: ""And then, get think going least 80% population immunity natural infection immunization, winter comes, going see surge again.""

What scenario end least 80% population either vaccinated immunity prior infection start Winter (12/21)? Near tell time June. It’s really though. young healthy individual realistically nothing worry about. Even that’s personal decision. Michigan’s Health Human Services: “Michigan consistently ranked among top 10 15 obese states U.S. Three every 10 adults Michigan obese (31.2%), 35.1% overweight (BRFSS 2015). Yea know case portion people. me, finding boundary something learned. master aspect, quality life outside work go significantly. I’m saying forcing someone take vaccine doesn’t full studies potential long term complications .0016% dying seems like overkill I'd surprised mask wearing healthy-feeling people persists significant capacity pandemic. Even East Asia, cultures much inclined towards kind thing, people wear feel sick (or pollution bad day) Saying month 60% get vaccine return normal giving specific date giving goal. agree, people reasonable enough let scientists decide, currently are. Routine controls? check documents? btw nation lockdown people supposed go anywhere, driving walking seems like good reason stopped college student would really hopeful everyone got vaccine fall, especially since UK variant basically shut one largest colleges state week ago, university still providing masks staff members sanitation workers. Students significant vectors virus, getting inoculated would drastically improve campus community economy surrounding areas. noticing trend sub getting filled Covid deniers ""iT's 0.5 pErCeNt"" people? can't believe getting downvoted comment. People know say shit like uneducated receptionists working table private practice. Mmmk sure, work health field qualified shut f*ck up. Russia vaccine submitted approval, likely timing issue vaccine. Chinese ones different. submitting vaccine approval ema? ... EU sign contract buy them. employer offering wage don’t want, find new job! Entirely logic Care share hospital avoid it? Perhaps try understanding everyone thinks way do. stereo type entire population don’t agree? second amendment gives right individual bear arms part well regulated state militia. don’t state militias anymore. want rewrite it, let’s that, can’t pretend existing amendment allows current gun laws. EU brought new powers monitor vaccine exports, would going across north sea without notice?

Probably export restrictions strict enough. Italy caught them, like tried find another country seek things through. Also, LPT: longer forget lunch morning, keep car key fridge it.

During winter I'd use stick leave without boots end day. plop keys boot. 8 months ago: “Vaccines key getting back large events”

Now: “Vaccines key BBQ family 4th July”

*vaccine hesitancy increase*

Public Health Experts: *shocked pikachu face* got WFH job literally morning. Earth downvoted much? Try nice, disgusting sneeze CPAP mask middle night. :-D look the, uh, what’s called, national vaccine injury fund shit. actually table proven side effects timeframes showing up, people paid fund they’re injured. side effects manifest pretty late.

I'm familiar it. I'm also aware fact cases I've reviewed- little evidence given vaccine actually responsible injury simply deemed easier provide compensation run side effects manifest pretty late.

Again- would love evidence this. ""recent"" cases vaccine side effects aware European swine flu vaccine Pandemrix Philippines dengue fever vaccine.

In Philippines case- vaccine specifically contra-indicated people strains Dengue given anyway political reasons.

In Pandemrix case- subsequent analysis CDC found causal link similar number new narcolepsy cases occurred China vaccine given. working theory since virus tendency cause narcolepsy, since swine flu already prevalent Europe time- increase cases actually virus.

As said- evidence would love read cases. notice hygienists believing shit like homeopathic medicine, essential oils, anti-vax, etc often? Maybe live, unlucky, swear every one I've talked believed crazy pseudoscience nonsense, swear like half fallen stupid pyramid scheme company like Young Living Arbonne. 

I get it, either I've somehow ran bunch extreme outliers, field attracts crazy people. country going certify vaccine certificate vaccine approved (or even submitted approval) country. would defeat purpose official, governmental certified document. grandma got first dose like week first dose. I'm totally hoping surprise house spring. Uh yeah that’s works? can’t safely leave house stay home. That’s it’s people certain conditions since dawn time. don’t force society adapt extremely small group people. 

Am taking crazy pills something? comments? god there’s lot stretching strawman going thread justify selfish viewpoints.  think want girl spit mouth over, honest Joe Biden better president Donald Trump. think main concern people unable get vaccinated since rely herd immunity shops manufacturing plants need help signs everywhere can't get people work there.

No kidding. machine shop pay $20+ hour starting experience, excellent benefits get like, one two interviews door. Same, remember January, honestly thought media hysteria, especially media tends sinophobic. thought like news piece make China look bad. remember joking around telling people take advantage cheap flight deals. Fast forward month like shit! privacy laws protect disclosing health data? Define misinformation. degree automatically make smart imo. know know thing studied years susceptible influences everyone else.  see. dont see good argument current interpretation supposed less valid yours. one thing valid alternative interpretation, completely different thing claim interpretation valid one. trump said scientists working vaccine part deep state? Fair enough get that, would weeding fast. ah, fellow 1 hour commuter!

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoy 21 days commuting. used productively personal gain moved work late around time, would shrink three roommates' commutes give insentive finish getting license.

All three ended laid 6-month mark, still drive work. That's depressing read that. would start looking new job honestly. current job 100% done home make go back bogus reasons, clearly care person something one tollerate employer last years bullshit. mean don’t really care either way, I’d I’d rather never see mask that’s hate seeing Like two thirds subreddit batshit crazy, realized sub commenting have. Well yes want turn banana republic ignoring contracts seizing private assets get job done. I've kept nose books kept writing friends contact possible. tried outdoors whenever could, read books friends borrowed strengthen bonds. might feel like much, best way keep up. Nextdoor app that's like facebook neighborhood. somewhat toxic depending neighbors use it, good comes like people posting alerts vaccines available nearby. 

I'll see find anything near Cowlitz Oh! go oldest don’t think queue much put name somewhere stay nearby. go list age. think youngest person 55. Grab popcorn 110% page here. 

Not office space honestly businesses opportunity pass lot typical costs back employees. (desks, internet, phone, headsets peripherals, hvac/utilities, even food janitorial costs). 

While I'm super fan taking costs without compensated, basically already paying majority personal use anyways. 

It seems like biggest obstacles, fear businesses make shift, are: 
1. Companies invested sufficiently ways develop culture engagement remotely. 
2. Many them, particularly bigger, grappled deal national pay scale ensure equity
3. frankly many people comfortable control (leaders individuals) work fully remote setting. 

Its disappointing catalyst move us rapidly remote first work environment. Booster shots may needed relationship SARS-CoV-2 may evolve like relationship 229E whatever. This, me, ""20 years now"" notion something count happening soon. also think sure thing since *pre*-symptomatic transmission seems widespread, relatively less selection pressure toward reduced virulence. 

My guess booster shots needed eventually, think we'll lining scheduling get winter, instead get every years, probably packaged things, TDAP shots.

I think fall probably strategic reserves vaccines targeted toward emerging variants, distributed superspreader groups needed. immunocompromised people can't get vaccinated. Thanks info. large number people stay LPNs meant temporary? course! Georgia near top deaths-per-capita, along Texas Florida South Dakota!

I mean, seriously people, every one states top 50 death rate! /s Maybe impression skewed...but are... lot nurses know like that. disagreement legally cannot done. cannot force vaccine people FDA cleared. program getting Americans take drug licensed able go work. WTF?  know thinking direction, comment reminded something people consider past. 100 people interconnected (say spouses/families 40 employees company) much less risky 100 randoms, things equal. “I’m going couple beers drive home free country makes uncomfortable one stay home.”  pa managed get first shot finding hospital 2hrs away. Went 2nd shot find appointment rescheduled one tell rescheduled for.The poor organization behind rollout mind boggling me. can’t force ppl wear masks, sure toothpicks aren’t going force ppl inject UNAPPROVED substance bodies. Immunity AROUND I’m sure. aren’t going US. know lot people mean well post ""college great anyway"" ""your 30's better"", much help younger people might struggling. one thing able look back college years 10 years later think much better life got (if that's true you), another thing watch memories could made slip away sit Zoom day. Fuck artist

Fartist  good start. wondering much information people going need, jump anything happens vaccines justify objective. ever need family safe There’s chance happen, manufacturing vaccines US anticipation approval immediate shipment.  Agreed, see FDA granting full approval quickly. Tens millions people vaccine point. problem safety, would know now. think quite wear masks errands around colder months. easy preventative measure helps avoid sick days/mild annoyances/the flu. stretch, reactions bizarre. people legitimate bad allergic reactions many vaccines, able vaccinated, even want to. 

If many people get vaccinated currently saying polls, virus going around public space long time, never enough people immune fully stop spread. world forever mine field vaccinated.

If chose that, choose risk. get choice. I'll regular memory cell vaccine,

&amp;#x200B;

but fuck hard mRNA vaccine horse shit. good luck yall keep working remotely. I'm saying fire people, dont show office unvaccinated. Oh, “when had” future, present, past one sentence? struggling see countries didn’t foresee UK way fault.

Where say UK ""at fault""?

The reason UK kind issue EU UK exporting vaccines, EU exporting vaccines, including UK.

That mean UK something wrong, necessarily, moreso EU step stop exports companies fulfill contracts. EU stopped exporting ~1.5 million doses week UK, maybe UK would longer able vaccinate without issues. special needs? part said understand?   really hard use massive economic power US government outbid everyone else vaccines. president would done.

The hard part starts they've delivered warehouse. surge unlikely unless variants become resistant current vaccines, unlikely well. alarmism fear-stoking. judging all, btw! I'm sorry family hit hard. glad light end tunnel finally sight. would “civilized society” exclude someone disagreeing choice regards body affects one else? I've working 5 days week office NY COVID issues. wash hands keep distance. allowed work home absolutely would (mech engineer), company culture. I'd love forced work home refusing vaccinations. would dream come true  organization waited year gain access lab, er mean sanitized wet market China source anyway. waiting China tell say.  Regardless results poll, poll? asking americans opinion medical protocol listen whatever scientists tell us. Science popularity get vaccinated, keep working home?

cool.  US-Americans one *the* dumbest peoples planet. would refuse paid leave work mandatory. Anyone says ""I work healthcare"" ""I doctor"" ""I nurse"" safely dismissed ends enough people stop complying restrictions. Papers please! really don’t get immunity 14 days saying ever since people started throwing vaccinated status people’s faces stupid Facebook posts. “Omg #blessed grateful one get vaccine, start life getting back normal!” Like people literally still bury loved ones alone weren’t deemed special enough get vaccine. December, more 200 million people have received least one dose COVID-19 vaccine worldwide — total number people infected virus (112 sheer number vaccines administered date, common, uncommon rare side-effects would detected now. What’s more, we’ve testing vaccines clinical trials since mid-2020, Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccines shown excellent safety also seen people raise concerns online mRNA vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, a “new” technology. mRNA (or “messenger” RNA) found living cells. mRNA message that tells cells make proteins trigger immune response inside body. immune response protects infection individual exposed virus. mRNA DNA (your genes), cannot combine DNA change genetic code. mRNA vaccines affect interact DNA in way. assured there’ll long-term DNA-altering effects mRNA vaccine resistance vaccination stems disinformation safety concerns vaccines. Common disinformation seen social media includes reports mRNA vaccines alter recipient’s DNA, cause infertility women, full toxins, cause autism. concerns countered fact-checking information campaigns, often accepted people looking confirmation preconceived also additional safety concerns raised social media safety novel vaccine technology rapidly developed.  Some potential recipients planning delaying vaccinated data gathered long term adverse events. far, data adverse events vaccine promising. Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine 0.6% vaccine group 0.5% placebo group report least one serious adverse event.  first 1.8 million US Moderna Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients, 21 experienced severe allergic concerns long-term effects, vaccines serious reactions occur within initial weeks administration. unlikely spike proteins expressed mRNA long-term effects, mRNA used translation quickly broken available long term system. Long-term effects vaccinations include RotaShield vaccine, caused rare type bowel obstruction, 1976 swine influenza vaccine, associated increased risk developing Guillain-Barré Yes! husband struggling back much. 1) actually productive home. crazy know worked less hours. difference comfortable. could wear whatever wanted. thermostat setting liked. could eat working take nap lunch break. Working home wonderful change him. visibility depressed since going back. 

2) drive traffic 2 hours day. week sees 2-3 hours day. 

It's really annoying. year proved people work fine home. even better. think definitely control thing. Well, assume people want conspiracy theorists. pressured taking taking it, people understandably concerned inject body. said, leave they'll make decision. Gonna point say people feed hesitancy fear, ironic I've seen mainstream year fear fear fear. comes sides.

Anyway, think would best let people make decisions - I'll consider taking vaccine anything like needing proof domestic activities take it. Whether that's right not, makes suspicious others. Definitely, would greatly reduce unnecessary traffic jams. would it. It’s perfect single file line situation. Obviously focus initial push vulnerable otherwise, people vaccinated, better are. 2-3% long term effects COVID based recent studies. long term effects correlate number symptoms initial illness good rationale thing significantly reducing disease severity also significantly mitigate long-term effects. Trump nothing distribution vaccines

Thats problem!

Trump threw vaccines states provided little support guidance. 

And could cope, got vaccinated secret sat hands. good template half US use weeks... sites fill bottles. US. one brand vaccine take.

Already many complications it. end day, politics. vaccine distribution/coverage map basically geographic politics map. Idk covid hit family hard felt good give piece mind. you’re right part felt guilty time see many people eligible aren’t taking it. well places throwing out. probably nobody checked me. didn’t get connections. literally went online signed hoped one would ask People right lie people, consequences free Ahhh.... Juicy Bits Fiction! Love it. never thought time, could sarah palin's fault angering music gods People already downvoting you, guess people would become enraged sight people choosing wear masks pandemic. they’re rewarding anti science folk! medical district hospital work rural Texas majority nurses refuse vaccine... even epidemiologist experts explain vaccines. nurses worked COVID unit. cited ""own research"" wanting ""wait information"". 

100% physicians APPs got vaccine.

Our hospital covered employees got sick quarantine without making use PTO - changed policy longer cover anyone refused vaccine without clear medical indication so. refuse vacination go back work?!? experience. seem grounded science. Admittedly, hang bunch hygienists, except continuing ed courses, might right. wacky people every profession though.  Watch assholes deliver doses US April EU whole quarter. assuming needed hit approximately 135 million since already vaccines arms day took office registered vaccine county’s health department specific website, required resident county. think might able get pharmacy luck getting appointment.  Yes please!! keep everyone safe, like immunocompromised can't get shot. work someone anti vax someone immunocompromised, anti vax infect immunocompromised. Many people unvaccinated literally deemed special enough warrant getting vaccine. agree people willingly go unvaccinated, one less deserving life go back normal simply surviving pandemic chosen career field, dumb luck, knowing right people. UK isn’t stopping vaccines exported. contract AZ first 100m doses, AZ use facility fulfill orders elsewhere.

The uk government backed Oxford virus, arranged deal AZ manufacture provided funding plant, sensible decisions clearly paying now. always going mad scramble vaccines, I’m struggling see countries didn’t foresee UK way fault. people ask don’t wear hearing aid—not understanding 100% loss. Hang there—you adapt years new normal—you 2019. 1986 first bedridden months. front people may little quirks manage hearing loss—like preferring specific chair conference table. I’ve never anyone fully supportive. Protect good ear! vitamin worked better masks everyone performing surgery would taking pills years US News kind junk site defunct print magazine. basically pump high volume articles every topic sun sort old-school SEO-spammy way, aggregate heap stuff sources, make endless ""best car \_\_\_"" lists pack 'er gills ads. Agreed. Though masking sick public part many non-US cultures long covid. it’s papers? Like certificate? Wow comments callous compared people reacted first time US hit 1000 death mark. never left office. staff did, two months. came back June. one person got it, traveled Las Vegas November visit relatives. smart since three risk groups - diabetic, minority, weight due diabetes. safe possible.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part, people vaccinated want come office meetings. thank you! interested. dressing either. could care less employee's wear, comfortable yet presentable, PJ's, lululemon tennis shoes, care. Staying safe care about. stupid reasons maybe stupid believe. know do, know, prefer office, except puppies home. Wish could side. Good. Good. point see personal moral stand apparently mad dash majority people.

I feel morally obligated wait lifestyle health mortally contingent getting vaccine.

I real trouble popular become people celebrate cutting ahead virtually hoarding health. Good. Fuck every last one death. swear sometimes feel like we’re one big movie one forcing anyone take vaccine. lifting travel restrictions work home guidelines changed risk profile. currently living restrictions due virus. choosing continue living without minimizing risk spread free so, still deal inconvenience restrictions private businesses. died, respectfully, poor health. 61% ICU patients obese. zero covid future. 99.9 percent people contract survive anyways vaccine fully vetted approved safe FDA, might better luck convincing people mandatory. mean time, forcing people get experimental vaccine isn’t illegal, it’s asinine. concern isn’t medical exemption isn’t going accepted all, it’ll difficult possibly take long time. always companies take sweet time recognizing things like exemptions, give people hard time it. I’m saying it’ll norm, probably happen. That’s said I’m hoping sort infrastructure laws clearly stating legitimacy medical exemption cards. something concrete back us up, “come man cool, look doctors says I’m exempt.” Maybe paywall Speaking misinformation.. hope include numerous ''viruses exist'' ''viruses exosomes'' ''germ theory wrong'' videos kept posted sudden last year. got bad one point comments educational videos viruses supposedly exist germs cause disease. Made feel like pulling hairs out..I report many videos.

Many people using excuse get vaccinated. fight actually gets when.. ""affects one else"" quite accurate case post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people stupid. Even vaccinated still infect people, stupid. Use brain Buddy, look different sources news. wonder nursing school like training education. critical thinking, scientific method, research skills emphasized nursing programs? “My body choice” holds weight choice doesn’t potential infect others. someone manages health personal decision. see institutions need bar people services. 

What institutions forbade obese people entering stores? valid claim could bad influence others promoting obese behavior. Dishonest? No. Anyone back-of-the-envelope calculation did. use 90% number care math well.

You cited vaccination rate vaccine approved US - that's importantly, readers world this, may gain value discussion well, readers US.

The title article _clearly_ states **Americans** rest world completely irrelevant far article Yes. medical coercion medical coercion matter procedure is. unethical force procedure someone will, coerce complying it, matter safe effective think is.

And again- already require vaccines schools- saying made either-or. you, me. attempts besmirch character grounds laughable.

No, actually didn't. reasonable person debate would well aware that- again- arguing Yes, moral fiber. seriously never heard phrase before? another way saying ""our way understanding right wrong, foundations understanding built.""

I know phrase- asked hell means 50% country bothered wear fucking mask excuse wondering moral fiber referring sure hell see also includes protecting rights liberties fellow citizens, lives.

And yet ""life"" first right mentioned Declaration Independence mentioned liberty Constitution Yes.

Well god help us smallpox makes comeback.  got..... bandaid CDC vaccination card. 

Fuck. ...I Idea fuck nonsense said you. can't enroll college country without vaccines. way common pretending is. Yeah, funny something would prove right. It’s culture, though. get mandatory paid sick days protection retaliation using them, low-income workers choice go work sick. morons burned shoes football player knelt couple times.

They're logical creatures. employer require employees receive one new FDA-authorized COVID-19 Generally, yes. EEOC stated equal employment opportunity laws “do interfere prevent employers following CDC federal, state, local public health authorities’ guidance suggestions.” However, potential complications employers must consider implementing mandatory vaccination EEOC confirmed vaccination medical examination, also pointed certain medical-related questions need posed individual vaccine given assure person medical condition makes vaccine unsafe. EEOC explains questions constitute “disability-related inquiries” regulated ADA, employers may ask certain said nurses highly educated. Critical thinking skills steer away Facebook science. missing here? much agree. miss hugging friends, miss seeing teachers hug students. Physical touch important.   I’ve administered vaccines talk doctors getting it. It’s CNAs/nurses. Yeah, Coloradans open getting whichever vaccine available first maybe Oregonians extra picky difficult maybe Californians probably waste bunch time fretting whether 3 cause cancer California. I'm joking obviously. right, kind funny.  That's true all. Dental hygiene school really competitive. Many people apply program accepted, others make graduation. think that's socialist ideal, logical one. mean look past year. makes pretty damned great case sometimes collective good trumps personal liberties.

How many deaths could averted politicized something basic wearing mask certain politicians pushing ""hoax.""  Kalenderwoche aka Calander week know could people get another vaccine? Probably União Quimica laboratory ask emergency use next days. documents required Anvisa goes well, emergency analyses takes 7 days. 

Edit: governors congress wants use vaccine without Anvisa approval, using approval countries agencies.  terrifies main reason take virus seriously! option live closer job. understand super long commutes. live 15 minutes work consider pretty good, anything 30 minutes I'd consider pretty excessive. feel like hour plus I'd definitely looking moving getting different job near term. true Pfizer too? I’m hard time finding definite answer. Today 14th day first Pfizer shot Well stupid analogy Polio killed kids en masse.

You know isn't? Covid. autoimmune condition. also pretty severe intolerance medications treat said condition, stable enough go without currently. doctor advised avoid vaccine, least now. cause issues immune system, I'm screwed. 
This , however, highly individual issue. I'm concerned restricted places vaccinated I'm told get it. Fucking americans... Coronavirus commissioner: lockdown Israel not. can't get wife yet get vaccine 60 targeted health problems. 3.5 months old point Hell yeah. get vaccinated, ostracize you. recklessly endangering lives others.

Pretty simple! curious: Georgia ranked 19th deaths per million far national average.  missed sarcasm tag looked up.  know much simpler be. 3X amount shots every American. Every American wants shot easily able get one. sure forcing people disclose personal health information required case plus sets terrible precedent companies certainly use employees. Say less. goes vitamin though fucking don't. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* People keep saying this, I'm sure I'm loop creeping normalcy lockdowns got them, I'm really sure mean.

For example, I'll constantly friends derisively say, ""Oh yeah, Bars X, Y, Z acting like pandemic."" Then, go, simply true. Sure, maybe following rules perfectly, stay open little past curfew, certainly February 2020 normal. took last week's Duke-UNC game place actually acting pandemic. “Highly educated” many meanings. Case point, one could argue Donald Trump “highly educated”. finally found room close uni febuari 2020. public transport hour! 10 minutes walking... :( standard vaccine availability effectiveness.

If vaccine effective widely available anyone wants one, zero restrictions.

If 100% population chooses get it, deaths drop zero, reopen. 1% population chooses get it, 99% refusing readily available vaccine, deaths remain tens millions, still reopen.

The increased risk death people actively choose increase risk death public policy concern. mandate cars seatbelts available, design effective, penalize using them, can't shut roads simply people refuse buckle up. Why? people believe vaccinations protects people take them?

That's advanced stoner fuckup prevention move right there. ITT: Collectove amnesia measles outbreaks couple years ago

Bring vaccine mandates. Choices come consequences you’re free go around spreading diseases don’t believe science think Anvisa register it? AZ jab sold cost, one makes profit it. pharmaceutical companies selling vaccines profit. companies extensive lobbying PR operations give lot political clout. media reporting AZ jab obviously skewed towards negative, politicians made misleading statements AZ decisions, including around supposed blood clot risks appear little... odd. don’t wearing tinfoil hat tentatively start joining dots. Enroll college without MMR polio vaccine see goes you. need know long vaccines effective. Without information, seems hard predict happen.  vaccines get today effective 1.5 years later, serious problems COVID US - unless either stop international travel contain COVID here, everyone get vaccinated again. time full authorization produced, disease blown nobody need vaccinated anyway. understand restrictions, hard feel like society traded health someone else's.

Yea, old and/or unhealthy peoples', ironically. existing ""export transparency mechanism"" would example preventative control, works manufacturers surplus (Pfizer) well behind. approve one block other. Also, simply alliance manager takes job seriously might help.

Surely also detective controls, imagine documentation requirements pharmaceutical industry already substantial. higher management would risk job shady dealings (export via allowed third countries etc) fear practices come light next (external/tax/due diligence/whatever) audit. filled form? got vaccinated everyone! One down! dumb goal Yeah. added comment I’ve seen lot people seem decide it’s “discrimination,” act settles matter therefor bad (and illegal?). think might bit helpful view situation less binary terms, instead sliding scale discrimination. think acceptable basis upon discriminate?

Businesses always going discriminate somehow. one end, perfectly acceptable discrimination, paying customers non-customers, reasonable distinctions. end, protected classes illegal discriminate based upon relation classes. somewhere between, discrimination might viewed immoral, still legal.

The person replied said “isn’t discrimination?” There’s really good faith (in opinion) way around acknowledging yes discrimination, discrimination doesn’t mean inherently bad.

“No shirt? shoes? service.” don’t think anyone care business discriminates customers follows rules don’t. It’s considered completely reasonable.

I think question need asking isn’t “is discrimination,” rather “are ok discrimination.” We’re tail end pandemic, way end pandemic mass vaccination. we, collectively, think benefits allowing type discrimination outweigh costs? one hand, certainly feel like massive invasion privacy, you’re forced sort medical treatment don’t trust don’t want; don’t, risk exclusion portion society. hand, also consider people’s right choose interact with. someone Covid conscious, able choose level acceptable risk. private business wants protect employees, might decide don’t want customers employees voluntarily forgo Covid vaccine. someone chooses ignore prevalent scientific thought midst global pandemic, don’t suddenly lose privacy rights, don’t per se deserve become excluded society. rights aren’t without limit. middle global pandemic, also consider public health economic concerns, along freedom choose associate with. Finding answer question society ask ourselves, think it’s helpful discussion rather “is discrimination.”



**I’m going assume people can’t medically get vaccine non-issue. Discrimination likely illegal, IMO peripheral issue law (and public sentiment) protect them. much bigger (and contentious) issue people medically able receive vaccine, purposely choose receive vaccination. morale booster workplace starting giving MSAs free coffee work company expense yrs ago. save money working home that. beats Dunkin addiction it. It’s mega-brigaded ignorants. way “99.5% people get survive, u afraid?” crap dozen upvotes response someone *not* moron who’s negatives. don't! currently filling job apps every night now. biggest reason one even wearing mask ENCOURAGED too. 
He small room day meeting one mask on. 

I used like company works for, past year shown true colors. 

We also want get state. half way put savings point. things considered guess I'm pretty ""lucky"" lose family friends COVID. lose job, fact got bonus check showing work everyday height pandemic. mentally last year taken toll.

I spent 2019 year self improvement physically mentally. felt like 2020 going year going pay off. started dating pretty good success. Met girl Tinder last weekend COVID really hit. wonderful. March 10th second date seemed going start something great. World turned upside down. 

She worked bartender lost job mom got sick too, got overwhelmed everything happening cancelled dates pretty much dropped communication. tough break even worse ones still come week. love sports cancelled. loved going gym. closed soon after. like every possible release distraction depression ripped away me. 

Eventually, came accept all. April feeling better adjusted well possible ""New Normal"" I'm feeling hopeful future. But, feel think always feel this. There's going small part always ""dark place"" knowing 2020 could've life. life I'd living COVID never thing. know though. I'm never taking little things like sports TV seeing friends granted ever again. sat mouth open??? take vaccine personal issues, demand people take even personal issues it? Amazing.

Really? Talk apples oranges argument. 

""I can't take vaccine severe allergic reaction possibly die"" someone issues health-wise take voluntarily decided whatever reason. understand basic science? Anti-vaxxers serious threat everyone else because: 

1. thing perfect vaccine. Pfizer approx 95% effective. still get virus vaccinated, makes significantly less likely, less likely spread milder symptoms.

2. people CAN’T get vaccinated (children, immunocompromised, specific allergies). Getting vaccinated protects THEM. would exceptionally selfish egotistical put lives risk refusing get vaccinated.

3. Unvaccinated people become vectors virus enable mutate virulent, even deadlier virus (which vaccine may protect against). would anyone right mind okay getting 90%+ vaccinated could eradicate virus (like smallpox, polio1&amp;2). 

Anti-vaxxers empathy others narcisstic, selfish creatures screaming “rights” absolute hypocrites ignoring right everyone else harmed deliberate spread eradicable disease.

STOP SPREAD. GET VACCINATED. AstraZeneca vaccine I'm anti-vax towards, lol. Yeah. I'm definitely managing better first happened. there's issues. Like I'm constantly dizzy, feel off. Ear feels clogged. That's actually bothersome tinnitus. Often forget tinnitus cause drive lot work can't hear car all. well thanks advise. much hope thing functionally end May, gap general pop adults start vaccinated (deadline May 1) widely available. May 1 deadline young, healthy adults country *start* get vaccinated. uh no. fuck off. Who’s 100 million party?

Edit: 27 days ago 50 million party. California updated tier map move whole bunch counties red tier allows 25% capacity indoor dining gyms reopen. counties move red tier Tuesday. Yeah, ignorance fact led actual increase cases Israel people first days first shot. People know would take 2 weeks protection start setting far less cautious year. Let’s hope don’t get curveball. Youyang Gu treasure throughout this.  it’s also true. 99% healthy people survive catch virus. don’t see it’s “propaganda”.

Canada performing population wide experiment Canadians delaying second dose much 4 months . . .

The topic controversial . . . anytime politics goes science going cause division.  article came want discuss something without anecdotes opinions, COVID19 go-to.

I completely agree statements.

I agree 21-day respected, agree ""variant escape"" best reason justify that. 

Thanks link media bias thingermajigger. Yup. department actually made presentation make case work home 50% time. One points involved time cost average employee spends commuting. thought bad 40 minute commute one way, colleagues traveling hour half. …what 1984? masked hidden house vaccinated like good little CDC guideline follower want. 

The CDC specific guidelines vaccinated people days they're already saying vaccinated people socialize vaccinated people low-risk. They're even saying nursing homes start visitors again! 

What completely alright CDC, regardless whether believe not. Maybe actually try finding CDC actually saying instead listening ignorant Reddit virtue signalers? thought. still can't figure wear masks right

Really? seen wear mask? Right, haven't. ""You mean shoved phone ass nothing?"" Sadly medical field profit driven, see alot staff believe insane shit. Imagine working hospital job depends vaccine. Thats like went car mechanic sold oil like fuck wouldnt ever put shit car. wouldnt trust mechanic ever.   UK far behind production 30m doses due last September 13m delivered far. AZ make difference almost-expired batch India 10m doses. look forward seeing plays out. Thanks info chat, well Philadelphia forever :)  would point. vaccine cannot used US already track vaccinate nearly everyone within couple months. exported? vaccines sitting around tens millions could saving lives elsewhere.

Unless 120, majority teachers, hyperactive immune system, expected response vaccine fever induced immune response. It’ll induce immune response, form minor body aches. It’s rare, usually seen hyperactive immune systems, immune response high fever makes people call work. 

As someone hyperactive immune system, get R&amp;D done. H1N1 vaccine worst fever sickness ever had, I’m go again. Haven’t caught yet, I’ll fine. know hygienic wash hands. Simple aseptic technique prevent viral infections. safer, seeing assholes cry complain huge side benefit! Fauci job right, always appear overreaction. huh...

I saying education among nurses varies greatly might contribute trend nurses outspoken anti-science voices?

No, implying nurses uneducated flat wrong required level education. Also arguing actual nurse.

It's 'trend', either, small number loud mouthed fuckheads making profession look bad. find anti-vaxx physicians, too, look hard enough. nothing education lack thereof, idiots every profession. idiots always there, social media makes voices louder before. 

I concede may idiots previous, hardly think large enough difference call trend.  speaking old people, speaking obese people.  may weeks holiday season. office usually someone who's hacking away like they've got covid bronchitis something hate sick Xmas/NY's season. reasonable want accept body medicine explicitly carries liabilities producers. even FDA certified ""safe"". vaccines granted sorts exemptions well thought out, long established, necessary safety protocols exist vaccines. 

It's unreasonable cautious this. guess media bad job reporting vaccine prevent transmission. reduces symptoms 50%. Give body needs. Rest hydrate. job working home give 1 1 tours always involves meeting leaders, directors, etc. somewhat lower totem pole show dressed business casual last 2 tours guests show jeans, longsleeve shirt football team mask recent one older lady showed tight yoga pants. showed pajamas lol. logic makes sense, except fact article say green tier ""when vaccination widespread"". Minnesota Mining Manufacturing

I love stock ticker symbol MMM Cool. telling thinking equal sceptic taking vaccine trolling? neither actually read comments realize delusional guy talking is. funnily enough makes question troll all. logic, shouldn’t already dead now?  private message link? You’re saying Americans won’t support article that’s literally Americans supporting lmfao Ill provide fake documentation lol. whack shit. one supports rules new reality, stimulus payments retirement withdrawals unemployment insurance, could cut bill even generate extra refunds. paying 28 euro already arranged delivery w/o delays shortages. Malta insignificant, Hungary it, imagine furore. dont understand comment, first second sentences contradictions. Look Pfizer moderna trials South Africa one... So, me, best way quell fears would compare AZ Pfizer/Moderna’s clot side effect result. it’s false side effect rates, see comparable number clot reports time. think author done work. saved 65 work days commuting. Another 6.5 work days spend hour getting ready work. That's pretty amazing! flu mutate get deadly every year despite fact large swaths world people get vaccinated? 

No. Stop talking like we're science fiction movie. Happy wear mask appropriate, think lot people resistant idea we'd adopt cultural practice.

There lot downsides, aside generally annoying, people see attempt force *them* wear mask, rather tolerate others choice. Personally think I'll feel like we've moved past pandemic masks optional public. also think valuable tools, efficacy overrated reddit. longer deadly virus spreads asymptomatically high prevalence society, downsides seem outweigh benefits scenarios. Personally, I'd like see people's faces again. Facial expressions important part human. numbers improving that’s sign bad things come. doctors absolutely giddy continuing. somebody think children!?! Wear damn mask. Instances regular garden variety flu dropped unprecedented levels pandemic protocols. Wear damn mask. Physical distance. Wash hands. it, wash stinky butt.

*(brought Council Even Washing Butt)* know why. America First. Biden explicitly continuing Trump's policy banning exports. give shit. I'm going forced take experimental vaccine mild virus. actually. covid gave clot worst place. think worst part covid really.  own. miss seeing people’s faces public. I’m early 20’s social person I’m ready get it, see comments like makes sad guess. Sigh took bus every day several block uphill walk bus stop, another walk bus office. reverse trip home. missed bus couple mile walk in.

Now flight stairs basement. I'm much worse physical shape. hours bus well worth health. people you’re complaining saying whining porches bar hopping since July. Yes were. set record fast vaccine created sent use public, using federal emergency approval, otherwise would taken couple years trials approved need data show long term studies. really well-thought-out position, apologize glib earlier.

I agree can't know sure degree opening employer-mandated vaccination impact community spread vs. opening voluntary vaccination.

Data seems indicate certain businesses indoor restaurants/bars likely increase spread COVID-19, also possible have/will soon reach point enough people voluntarily receiving vaccinations makes problem moot.

I'm sure say we're yet, agree businesses open. That's I'm advocating business require in-person employees vaccinated. shuts argument need stay closed minimizing health risk. people planning vaccinated anyway, policy becomes redundant business ease knowing good position safety standpoint. use see clinics/hospitals antibody therapy available. I'm sure they're restricting high risk covid complications not.  Doubling misogyny too, real class act. wow, people don’t trust government harmed them? shocking daily headlines different areas rolling back restrictions they’re really memorable people live there.  stop paying attention restrictions effect

I fly time can't imagine something I'll remember rest life. get saying fully disagree reach imho.  Movie...Contagion Children don’t go offices position racist who? white americans 😂 fuck don’t remember skeptical early vaccine talk last year. sure going 5+ years even close year later. Johnson&amp;Johnson approved US emergency authorization 66% effective. chosen ignore order accuse dishonesty?

""The vaccine 72 percent overall efficacy rate United States""

""The vaccine 85% effective preventing severe diseases, 100 percent effective stopping hospitalizations respond article. responded comment replies coercing people get vaccinated via forced mandatory COVID tests cost.

Except talking forcing context article idea would bring rest that's dishonest. never said anything schools, vaccine-as-entry-requirement buildings institutions, insinuating somewhere everything I've said contains something children schools. No, never brought up.

But did- ignored question asked again.

You categorically stated mandatory vaccination asking includes schools.

And what's more- failed answer question.

Do support mandatory vaccinations schools currently required- yes say Founding Fathers would support pressuring people financial means get jab. hasty forget famous quote.

They lot worse case aware give essential liberty obtain little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty safety. - Benjamin Franklin

Oh good- another person fucking clue quote _actually_ means reference SIEGEL: far pro-privacy quotation, anything, pro-taxation pro-defense spending WITTES: quotation **defends authority legislature govern interests collective security**. means, context, quite opposite almost always quoted saying much closer opposite thing people think means.

So fact- quote actually supports argument, :)

Try reading quote spout nonsense understand. I'm getting vaccine 20th hop ass.

Granted want get it, care others. data dosing error. Yes please, never want commute again. really surprising prior infection factored vaccination program. would save tens millions doses mean many people could get vaccinated sooner, adding immune population (through prior infection vaccination).

I appreciate might confuse message (""Get needle arm!"") people could vaccinated could get infected die. know many vaccines produced per week America? People disabilites complication prevent getting vaccinated real protected class. think shoild vaccinating chemo patients? remember watching Lombardy get locked ... scared shit me. knew next. Tragic going again. everyone said pandemic over? definitely analyze medical perspective, I’m arguing political legislative one. 

In end, comes person’s decision whether take vaccine. Especially she’s doling checks former health secretaries say resigned. public building last year get drivers license renewed. way would go inside grocery store. Yup. took year say this. don’t see concerns all. offend much someone else somewhere may wearing mask? every flu season Asian countries; mean they’re hypochondriacs? love idea public transportation, love option, this. Denmark's EU. way see it, longer use paradigm ""wear mask/get vaccine save **another person**"" majority population reached herd immunity virus -- whether natural exposure vaccination.

Since virus cannot become longer apocalyptic menace purportedly supposed become, would logical, practical, moral, mandate person change behaviour order save small minority people. Furthermore, insist mandating protection immuno-compromised COVID stringent measures human behaviour, make significant follow-up steps (lest hypocrite) apply measures protect immuno-compromised whole slew diseases could perish: list probably quite large. doubt willing that. “If stopped drinking fancy coffee everyday could afford new car, insurance, maintenance, college, house” - Boomer Fantastic news. 14% adult population fully vaccinated, another 12% partially vaccinated one dose, enough vaccine fully vaccinate another 6% population en route facilities. honestly understand people talking upcoming Fall surge. Pretty sad many people need paid something benefit everyone society. Im vaccine site rn many people desperately wanting shot, big joke people refuse get want fake tough guy disobey health guidelines, intended help everyone, stick man whatever bs use justify actions.  hope don’t get vaccines personally.  don’t much anything SA variant, already circulating MB buying alot vaccines isnt exactly immpressive. shows smart buyer Hey gave today!!! Although counted yet didn’t, general statement keep seeing UK criticised. say UK isn’t allowing vaccines made exported though isn’t true, it’s simply contract first 100m doses vaccine currently production UK. 

The EU isn’t exporting anything. Private companies facilities EU are, line contracts signed various countries, outside EU, like private companies UK exporting products used vaccine manufacturing.

The EU lagging behind countries able move faster make better deals. late party ended “best efforts” clause contract countries already made firm commitments manufacturers. many states gonna open May 1 give paper copy vaccination record well. keep mine wallet, laminated too. Maybe it’s personal experience flu every year (including years got flu shots), I’ll gladly take masks flu seeing people’s lovely faces infect me. Let’s go!

Generally, it’s truly required workplace (say medical worker dealing measles outbreak) accommodations cannot reasonably made allowed. likely case COVID-19.

Also at-will employment there’s nothing stopping employer firing reason. Though would highly suspicious firings occurred inquiring vaccination status, discrimination case likely made. get hate normal society use argument makes seem like come back.

You lockdown lovers ridiculous  We've gone three flu seasons work without single outbreak. Usually 1/4 shop misses work passes through. We've 3 COVID cases wear mask around - mask anywhere else make sure ever got spread it. armed services.

I’ll happily take free leave! refused vaccine it’s still early approval process I’m old enough remember happened anthrax shots mandated military members. 

I’m also young enough low-risk I’m homebody doesn’t come contact many people. people benefit vaccine I, I’m happy give place line them. work ventilator dependent patients. instances pneumonia year like 10 percent typical year. honestly don’t think ever stop wearing them. staff haven’t getting sick either.

the quote guanwho prompted write response - know many people think mask mandates place forever - I'm even related them! hope helps clear said said! depressing look around see people think EU way alternative economic armageddon. 3, enough fully vaccinate every adult USA end May Pfizer Moderna delivering 100 million Johnson Johnson 60-80 million apfil 1 end May.  time AstraZeneca gets approved, supply US problem, you;ll supply get arms per day sitting decent stockpile already. Absolutely correct. 

It *almost* called chicken egg problem, really. *reason* occuring matters. reason infecting people binds cells easily mutations. *not* infecting people virus infected people *might* spread virus around. proven case shedding function much virus have, considered ""significantly"" viral load relates much virus surroundings researched. Didn’t get placed hold Europe due clotting issues? want noticed likely get noticed alarmist calm measured.

Although im assuming study Thank you! lol ... yep I’m one those, I’ve got small child dependent co-owned small business wife doesn’t provide sick leave (we owners). unfortunate tendency catch every respiratory virus there. entire pandemic year, childcare. (My parents recently moved close us, things better now)

My nightmare scenario wasn’t much dying COVID - knew wouldn’t. incapacitated month. self-employed. don’t work, don’t make money. don’t watch kid, wife doesn’t make money. I’m also primary caregiver child. I’m sick watch month, she’ll traumatized - never mind she’s going let rest recover peace. experience every contagious disease “power taking care small active child”. can’t really COVID.

And that’s best case scenario don’t get LongCOVID. Two acquaintances got that. unable work unable work 4 months now. One heart surgery. don’t know would happen family happened either one us, don’t want find out. 

So yeah - soon I’m vaccinated, go shopping whatever, now, careful. sure comment discussion risk exposure grocery shopping. People think lots things ""for greater good"" subconsciously unconsciously trying maintain position power celebrity. Many people capable kind self-delusion, tell virtuous/altruistic reasons engaging behavior actually self-serving way. idea ""for greater good"" reasoning way conflict people want control population ahistorical. hope better focus hygiene continues.

But doubt surrounding states get COVID control? California exist bubble coming leaving states could spread COVID around (even loads people travel avoid getting tests done wearing mask). truly shocked think way vaccine, drugs market. Heres counter, reason get vaccinated besides beliefs, it? virus around seasons, unless im missing something, would anyone want risk catching it? want hard facts philosophical non sense. going shot passed 3 million shots per day. close! fucking easy people surrender liberties. Makes men pessimistic future societies.

The covid saga greatest biggest psichological experiment history. Goverments obtained data learned manipulating people total submission years CIA experimentation ""mk ultra"" like experiments.


Its trully magnificent...in bad way. nurse, even harder get ends. dealing increased workload expectations, increased death disease, mental health heavily impacted normal coping mechanisms either frowned upon question. mention several friends family scared healthcare professional beginning even could see want see me.  I’ve coming realization lately. tentative July 6th back work date looking realistic every week :(

Today worked laptop backyard sunbathing drinking white claws. going miss shit MUCH. written early December prior FDA EUA. goal article get front misinformation get people think critically, crunch safety data.  Turns there’s shit ton really dumb people medical field. 

If you’ve ever chronic condition, find quickly. includes doctors. Nobody cares. dead ICU = whatever, responsibility. vaccinated hard way.

Immunity last long virus mutate. 

The high number opt outs means COVID going become endemic virus we'll need new shot every year deal prevalent mutation. like flu... well numerous legal hurdles you’d jump. lived rural America garbage internet found vaccine could reception, iPhone could not. would pissed. Yeah, we're really staying house. feel responsibility curtail spread thing order minimise dangerous variants, person spreads someone vulnerable, keep hospitals getting overrun. guess know nurses doctors thru really scary shit past year? can't believe people can. really get this. logic people use justify personal information gathering.

""If anything hide, worried it."" little 20% Americans received dose COVID-19 vaccine. strong effort three months distribution, importantly, another surge occur, number vaccinated significant implications surge’s possible severity You’re toxic, it’s wild.

“Did stutter” 

Chill Clint Eastwood.

I’m cool ending note. good life, man. really mean that, don’t even know you’re heated. Tip: Life’s short angry time. ignoring study came week reduced transmission? Yes totally sinister anyone says differently worth breath. aunt law one people. She’s fuckin pharmacist still believes bill gates 5G towers DNA-altering vaccine conspiracy theories.

The second catch wind advising customers getting vaccine conspiracy related reasons I’m reporting college. Similar situation here. moved city last March could closer fun things wanted go like concerts, movies, restaurants... Yeah feeling stupid one now. Let's also forget dose price, US UK paying $3+ per dose. EU wasted time negotiating price €1.78 dose. cannot see manufacture cost vaccine cheap Western Europe, unless choosing cheapest contractors manufacture vaccine (AZ manufacture provide contractors license it)? United States, Texas summer isn’t “normal” going riots. rooting it. can’t tell people “stay home, save lives” government simply ineffective. mean like Chinese government tried silence scientists initial outbreak leading global pandemic? Yeah, Chinese government great.

I think mean scientists able convince governments (eventually cases) enact measures. governments simply ability enforce measures, desire enforce them, populous willing follow them.

Those governments come ideas own. listened scientists. rolling average 2.5 million would get us 1% eligible population day. Split 2 2 dose vaccines yet we’re definitely going see things moving along. Slightly topic, picture freaks tf out. that, too. started working home, made coffee. cheaper, much **better**. forced back, became one people brings giant thermos coffee work every day. believe statistics, say safe won’t approved month really CLUE you’re talking about. false information spreads. Hell yeah think so, significant enough groups population *don't* vaccinate kids see outbreaks totally preventable diseases like measles happen within last years. pope shit woods? masking idea another way people dishonest. Masking policies social distancing interrelated inevitably cut social interaction, large part healthy normal society many industries. effects things countless ways. live entertainment industry irrevocably damaged. Concerts, conventions, sports events, theaters, live musical events, dining, lower higher learning, severely disrupted past year employ millions people. can't really mask policy without social distancing policy, effect extremely disruptive normal commerce social interaction knew it. every entertainer magically go twitch youtube make living replace old careers. lose lot individual options reaching audience means negotiating salary pay platform social algorithms take over.

I’m one studies idea got real vaccine likely never will. allowed case? get second vaccine excluded trial data longer useful, possibility get two different vaccines may side effects could really negative. suppose I’d considered unvaccinated chooses matter. It’s interesting think about, enforceability something like brings lot questions. vaccine literally untested anything efficacy. It’s funny people say anti science facts literally science saying safe thing inject body. requires years years testing establish science. I’m anti vax aware corona potential complications long term effects anyone honestly thinks untested vaccine doesn’t run kind unknown risks misinformed science actually is. Boom. spot on.    People acting like he’s gonna like “okay 100 million shots time call day” hit goal. wasn’t like weren’t trying many possible trying get 100 million shots. obtainable goal makes look good achieving, that’s politics work. Ha ha ha~!

Actually, sub’s rules pretty clear. Perhaps could try r/Coronavirus instead? 

Have pleasant day.  guy taken CTP's mantle? Especially hospitalization data? Nobody says turn back that. OP sees justice keeping black people vulnerable due distrust (though that's far main reason racial inequity vaccinations) rather mandating vaccination public health protects everyone.

Building trust public health oppressed communities requires actual work reform/revolutionize approaches them, tear systemically racist practices *still* happening. vaccines forefront small sample sizes minority ethnic populations, little wary reasonable. solution must improve testing vaccines carefully trace results, leave populations disproportionately vulnerable they've repeatedly abused. Get here, traitor looking wrong number — important thing vaccine prevent getting really sick — sick enough hospitalized maybe even killed. And, measurement, three vaccines perform exceptionally well.

The problem young adult biggest concern. biggest concern getting havingong term effects, regard Moderna Pfizer appear better. obviously example, many people die complications blood cloths years? many people had/ died cause blood cloths getting vaccinated? scheduling big issue right now... talking late summer future state. expect better/easier ways less technically enabled folks get appt. 

But absolutely valid concern. think statement contradicts negates 8 Months Ago statement. entire population Windsor, would like know they'll checking ID. Idk getting downvoted, I'm US agree more. backfire, horribly. lot lawsuits forthcoming. Maybe start making jobs pay livable wage people incentivized instead collect unemployment. already happening. Right athletes told allowed leave olympic village practice competitions amoubt time tgey allowed country also extremely short (for big event anyway). pretty gross people wash hands. like handwash station idea though. Wish work. places wash up. not? Genuinely curious. someone that's go office every day since pandemic started, makes sense. number cars driving major roads dropped dramatically, means people (including myself) driving faster due traffic slowdowns. know anecdotal, I've seen cars driving 80-90 MPH stretches roads normally see speeds higher 25 MPH due traffic. Yes, people sick. don’t want live world masks everyone they’re showing symptoms anything. It’s like living dystopia. interesting moral debate. wrong cut line primary goal many shots many arms possible? knows morally ""right"" answer is. got virus showing symptoms yet go around spreading virus without knowing? public tendency forget exist. yeah I'm bothered people can't get it, I'm bothered people *won't* get dumbass reasons. medical exceptions well established planned easily prove fired refusing disclose private health information clearly illegal due HIPPA.

Amazing people went ""Insurance companies can't ask pre-existing conditions"" ""show proof medical treatment entrance property"" real quick. anecdotal, everyday hear someone new social circle expecting kid sometime summer. Ding ding... good PR coming single country alone. rest world much travel state get vaccinated Michigan ? Fall better summer

Based what? We'll almost entire adult population vaccinated end June. 3 vaccines 100% effective severe disease death known variants. reduced effectiveness pertains preventing asymptomatic/mild cases. Haha no. good luck finding hospital like this. 1 2 1000 chance getting blood clot year. number way off.

Source: March 1st moved would minutes away office. Mistakes made.

Lmfao, boat. can't drive due epilepsy wanted really close. I'm paying extra $500/m privilege. Worked pretty well hospital work at.

* 2 times uni open.

I feel like prisoner. dramatically reduces asymptomatic infection, spread without realizing. Vaccinated people infected also lighter viral loads make less likely transmit. article equates “green tier” “return normalcy” multiple times. don’t think difference “law” “FDA procedures require house, senate, president sign bill” pedantry.

Yes, change fact rules can't arbitrarily changed pointed out, LNPs. immediately apparent, Moderna Pfizer use different LNPs. least one formulations different approved 2018, route administration different too. LNPs long history toxicity, due positive charge serum shreds cells.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  bother? They'll lie next guy then. Tell patients instead going tell anybody. Yes, people seem think ""Green Tier"" means life pandemic, get impression. highly doubt even legal proposing due HIPPA anyway. Even without moral ethical dilemma seem selfishly ignore due irrational fear. one's dictating anything *here*, in, hugging.

Original comment: ""Imagine letting government tell allowed hug""

Imagine letting government tell allowed go bar? Wait, already.

Imagine letting government impose health standards restaurants large events. Wait, already. Meanwhile, they're fine schools reopening full unvaccinated children. "" ultimately decided known risks Covid baby worse unknown risk vaccine. "" 

This right way look it. OB /Gyn discussion many patients feel vaccine tested enough get pregnant. vaccines new, mRNA vaccines decade studies behind them. COVID likely damage body harm pregnancy vaccine. molecules within vaccine likely leave injection site mRNA rapidly destroyed used. thing likely pass baby immunity, beneficial. Okay, epic 😏 would advocated, rather, expected, attempt made assess quality research done. 

In words, predictable obstruction. J&amp;J confirmed vaccines delivered April 2021 EU. Hopefully true. Why? two coworkers take vaccine stupid conspiratorial reasons. 

One going office already seem really care. person like this. 

The scared getting vaccine, also scared Covid19 going back. would like this. 

Whatever case, suck offered vaccine work take it. did. able pass chance vaccinated others can't even get plain stupid. work ventilator dependent patients. instances pneumonia year like 10 percent typical year. honestly don’t think ever stop wearing them. staff haven’t getting sick either. wish could forward people charge company.

This past year proved everyone work job home old-head-boomers charge keep talking can't wait see everyone office again. We're supposed stop eating babies covid? Oops. way, agree. That's social safety nets exist pull people worst.

I'm glad made far least. somewhere second third time ""starting over"" narrowly avoided worst, thankfully. None previous setbacks bad, hoping new skillets I've tried learn past year pay eventually.

It's hard tell point. many industries contracted guarantees return viable employment. accelerated already existing trend, I've seen. 100 million shots arms! Astra kind botched trials: blunders half dose, older groups small late, miscommunication transverse myelitis cases. 
The US/FDA also trust Oxford. Well call anti-vaxx.

There little data medium-term protective effect vaccines people immune compromised, includes people pregnant elderly. numbers people throwing around trial data handful participants getting infected trial period months. results promising, enough gamble talk certain terms. Given observed death rate immune compromised wrt COVID-19 around 8-10%, can't take slight conveniences seriously compared know situation. 

Those sentiments combination itchy trigger fingers looking dismiss suffering others vs. minor selfish preferences (a la anti-maskers) well people feel legitimately burdened anxiety distance become beaten situation thrust socioeconomic powers outside control. former, mean them, alienate them, stand strong. latter, empathy solidarity, remind trade-offs. Nobody wants wonder whether killed grandpa friend brother acquaintance. lol hasn’t happened. 

We thing called 4th Amendment prevents things like happening. 

We road checkpoints it’s you’re driving road it’s usually it’s big party night it’s like one intersection policemen driving around stopping people random. someone works super interested concept “privacy.”

Because haven’t seen shred evidence existence concept years. exponential growth screwed us infections play vaccinations too, though. getting faster better time. hope ✌️ Nope. Gotta show proof vaccinated Aug 2021 eligible PTO day. PTO go get vaccine day. reduces risk spread would vastly reduce general ability virus sustain within human population.

If everyone could vaccinated (aka shots +2-3 weeks) tomorrow human human transmission virus would effectively stop completely. Yes would still exist animal hosts risk human human transmission would much much lower.

The reason quite simple, risk spreading virus strongly related much virus multiply within you. Let's put fictitiously simplified numbers example.

1 infected human without vaccine. Virus could replicate 1,000,000 times, human infectious others.

1 infected human vaccine, Virus replicate 200,000 times, human vastly less infectious.

Urgh could write bother already get going anytime soon, enjoy putting others risk, remember one day situation may reversed may vulnerable. RN 4 years. RN 2. BSN 4 online programs it’s like 3. took pre-requisites time nursing program don’t think super uncommon. restricted everything public. stay house forever Yeeeeaaah......I’m gonna need come Saturday finish TPS reports. new studies effective first shot moderna vaccine days ? Americans also support McDonald's think fuck not? would America then? Jesus No, comment dumb, think statistics works?

If monitor health 1000s people 10 die cause blood cloths, usually happens every 1m people, start thinking correlation. exactly 0 boomers forced work get vaccine. personally threatened CEO even wear mask. mention, 94% 100% chance. Plenty people exposed covid catch it, really fantastic rate protection. Absolutely incredible. apply ""At Will"" states? Americans also seem oppose vaccine passports think anyone really thought through. also typical American though.  Ah fellow hour long one way commuter.

I never math saw comment. can’t believe sit traffic long. job already talking us come back. Noooope. I’ll drop twice week tops like 10-3. ain’t going. point it. I’m actually productive house non work clothes, monitors, chair. Plus hate bright office buildings are. problem unvaccinated people become vectors virus mutate enable become even virulent deadly. also soread vulnerable people can’t get vaccinated like babies 6 months, immuno compromised people, specific allergies (eg egg). 

So summary vaccinating protects yourself, everyone else around you. 

Just get vaccinated. difficult decision make. rushed. boat here. get vaccines, hyperactive immune system. get sever fever every time knocks days. Happens flu shot every year H1N1 shot years back worst. I’m going roll dice one H1N1 vaccine experience. What’s point then? stay closed forever? You’re reinforcing initial impression correct. Talking would productive talking flat earther. someone used racial insults towards Obama. say anything ""permanent?"" works. Countries write laws boarders. writes laws govern contract? Yup, people signed it. sue, freeze assets nationalize factory want to. AZ one bargaining chip (vaccine), EU holds rest, including executives ability enter EU without going prison, patents filed EU, assets held EU, etc. EU anything, may anything, idea can't absurd. article say mask mandates green tier supposed permanent Maybe it’ll irrelevant Mine same. don’t get vaccine, job (unless pregnant nursing). Ah understand. Yes, fully appreciate privilege working home. Take care perhaps start looking new opportunity position so. Spring usually prime time hire all. Well, are. still can't sit inside restaurant. still can't go bar serves alcohol. still can't go baseball game still wear mask. mandates state. Actually yes, significant portion black community voiced distrust vaccine. don’t see turn back that, needs discussed. isn't. supreme court decided Jacobson v. Massachusetts. Look makes feel better, always lunatics. difference aware now. I'm sorry. Sending love apply April. country manufactures vaccine might reliable source information side effects even turns suspension overly cautious J&amp;J produced Janssen Pharmaceutica Netherlands. people never cared hundreds thousands people dying. Sounds like you’re saying vaccine’s effective. gulags you!

In reality, slow non adopters helping get vaccine quicker there’s really nothing good news since vaccine started rolling en masse. headline authoritarian propaganda. Bro couple questions: doesn’t happen live police stop cars check documents, everything’s right, driving drunk stuff? (I think it’s called checkpoint). happens normally, don’t get shouldn’t happen people literally allowed go out.

Have country region lockdown year? so, enforced? gatherings banned, police check you’re party house? UPenn also deserves credit research candidate based Nothing says democracy like oligarchic institution democratic oversight appointing vice president, one least popular candidates primary, lost home state Andew Yang, take solo calls world leaders otherwise act president without single vote electorate. equally oligarchic north korean esque media rave triumph democracy shoved throats. fine. barely check credentials CA. healthcare definitely qualifies you!  tons “I totally got COVID twice never actually positive test first time dude trust bro reinfections thing” posting Reddit.

/s definitely seems like demand still high enough people receiving fast administer them.

I think lot facilities peak efficiency, every aspect, getting appts listed, filling them, administering shots. 

we great throwing everything together really fast ton vaccine events around us ""know"" about. 

In rural areas, supply demand also. cities, enough supply.

i’ll never forget sitting car class (in late february) reading wuhan started ppl wear masks public. actually shrugged felt like would never even half bad US. combination things - history, well big diseases (sars, h1n1, ebola) - thinking would even come close “worst case scenario”. almost never do. doesn’t happen. unfortunately, did. nothing could told march 11th, 2020 following twelve months would believed. 

i’ll never forget first day ohio’s stay-at-home order end march. met friends kroger parking lot get something ... live relatively populous suburb. soon left neighborhood, could tell everything different. cars road rush hour thursday. i’ve never seen anything like don’t think want ever again. 

i’ll never forget optimism things would fine “in months”. particularly sports, remember early postponements would brief ... iirc MLB expected would able start season month later originally planned. murmurs march madness could still happen, late april may. friends even bought music festival tix august, expecting things fine then. college, several ohio, originally planned online classes two weeks (my school decided switch online rest semester two days announcing would two weeks lol). it’s funny look back obviously, i’ll never forget hopeful start pandemic. 

there lot things i’ll never forget lot things hope **to** forget. could go past 365 days, don’t time space lol. hope never experience something like ever again. hope next 365 days treat much better previous 365. That's months away. state supply dont see not. friend accidentally signed tier called site ask okay come told it. Better shots go waste. Also, still many anti vaxxers refusing take even qualify.... get vaccines without issues? seen

Doesn’t exactly answer question, good info anyway - Get shot petulant child. difference minimal. sure Foxnews, et al would said ""oh fell short, big deal, we're still better rest world."" US might perfect democracy, flawed one, democracy nonetheless. 

Democracy form government govern peoples, see rich people controlling government US called plutocracy. labeled themself democracy flawed democracy trying whitewash themself force good. version democracy ≠ force chinese democracy, even flawed one.

Of course fit western version democracy. Chinese election system, political system ensure voice people heard people supportive government. chasing fundamental idea democracy/socialism/ communism western definition it. Western democracy using election political argentinian, country lot LOT experience dictatorships totalitarianism

So tell dictators got power democratic US instated them.
For dictator, totalitarianism, communism, monarchism democracy good goverment stuff treat people others well. want choose benevolent dictator vs murderous democracy, always choose benevolent dictator, political affinity point assure democracy even flaws trumps dictatorships

Then version democracy roles shifted, US longer supporting dictatorships region, 

So know shit 'democratic country' still worshipped them, stockholm syndrome? coup bolivia? tried assasinate venezuela president instate China is, like venezuela

China non-interventionist, trade anyone regardless come power, support. happen Pfizer, high quality ingredients come outside EU, blocking export Pfizer vaccine would likely end tit tat quickly resourced raw ingredients production would suffer nothing. would better encouraging Pfizer production efficiencies increase output.

But knew that. goal tire people feel compelled refute deliberate misinformation. Countering energizing, tiring. 
 
“Nice try though”! Guess people saving travel money 7 day average inauguration day 892k according NYT. Obviously take much push million / day. 

Also, Biden originally set goal Dec. 8th! later revised based rollout going 150m say joke made vaccines even distributed surely taking advantage hindsight (and ignoring political benefit short, memorable goals like 100 shots / 100 days). year now, we’ve living constant fear Covid-19. get vaccine arm, it’s like stress magically melt away.

For pretty much did. Yeah, thought thing responded. fact Americans strong policy sticking heads sand late. (Covid positive) girlfriend’s first day quarantine also day work offering first dose vaccine. safe get then? (Other shitty side effects, course) that's case, least half world Mordor, half either conquered conquered. Real ID sounds like great idea, hopefully work soon use elections. still came scientists. Seems like strange semantic argument me. fucking don't. Oh, don’t give reason stay unvaccinated. Trust this? Why? typical vaccine sense sense injecting dead virus allowing body learn fight it. injection similar cancer. Hit downvotes insane. Congratulations, Americans!

You may realize it, everyone isn’t like you. Saying fine fine, don’t worry, isn’t sincere. Stop making assumptions people don’t medical issues constantly monitor aware of. Well lab rats multiple drug companies course ! curveballs always possible, everything hold, think we'll hit 4000 day dying again. listened scientists.

That makes sounds like scientists randomly selected people; South Korea's government, instance, already full-on pandemic response team due issues deadly coronaviruses (remember SARS/MERS? Probably not). scientists part government, could say governments come ideas actively employ scientists within ranks. briefly job hour twenty away average day, hiring manager lied said could work home three days week change tune week in.

&amp;#x200B;

I miss concerts NYC December though. Looking forward again. US [just announced today promise 1bn vaccines rest They're prioritizing vaccinating countrymen first, philanthropic. Given 4k people dying day month ago, seems like reasonable approach. Honestly love staying home. fact smoke pot work efficiently effectively I'm work go random drug tests godsend. Anti vaxxers really excluded now, makes think change? there’s way say Pfizer Moderna vaccines would fared trials run time J&amp;J’s.

There’s plenty recent data coming Israel UK showing Pfizer least performing well today trials. works faster — It’s also one shot, compared two doses needed vaccines.

It doesn’t actually work faster. J&amp;J didn’t start seeing significant protection 28 days shot (and antibody levels didn’t peak day 50 something). Pfizer you’re fully vaccinated 35 days first dose Moderna it’s 42 (assuming got 2nd dose schedule). 

I get they’re pushing this, it’s important people get vaccinated quickly possible vaccine better nothing. trying deny isn’t less effective vaccine strictly PR move. may create another account vote several times Nice idea theory, 

It is, fact, bad idea theory.  

1. public health experts recommend it
2. burden fall disproportionately least able manage it. Paperwork screw-ups prevent people earning living poorer are, less resources cut red tape get things fixed.
3. Big tech wants put ""vaccine passports"" people's phones get even tracking data us, selling safety nobody notice doing. drug company made investigated said they’re safe. Yea holds weight Facebook post honestly nursing homes area hire LPNs least 20 25 bucks. Nobody area would work less. Also responsible care least 20 patients varying levels health. really shitty LPNs there, incredibly intelligent ones too. Let gooo! First time anything indoor open county YEAR!!! (Aside 3 weeks June) let’s continue opening !! ""Stop telling people are, let tell are!""

I know desperately trying justify actions much can, simple fact willing bet want wear mask take precautions. would put huge money fact never gave one shit stuff mentioned, still (well, unless directly affected). things talked taken consideration, fact plans created minimize many things selfish assholes blew combined politicians refused follow them. many things created recommendations enacted. also like conveniently ignore main reason done. Either brush aside like big deal because, well, issue you. people matter much anyway, right?

Yet end day want reason logic. know really want. try find want convince selfish reasoning much better egghead scientists. get mad ""attitude"" want. thing really makes angry know right. different definitions healing

Thought bandaids. mention long detailed post mom SC she’s eligible vaccine trouble finding anything. tips give search? far Dr J&amp;J fee, CVS booked. helpful tips would really appreciate it! Oklahoma?  literally care. know many people call selfish take multiple days mind wage job LOSE I'm PTO already year? easy nobel finances abused it. 20+ years ago used spend 2hours travelling work 2 hours back, changed jobs one could walk work 20 mins like whole new world. selfishness, discussion dislocation society suffered due lockdowns worth disease less 1% death rate functionally threat anyone age 60. simultaneously overreacted underreacted. it? awesome. European Union placed bets wrong vaccines. IMO - really buy mRNA vaccine potential. would guess maybe 25m? many actuarial age? Yes that's said. executive order said. Read fucking article. Trump lying grand revelation you? Countries like Slovakia high death rate per. Milion :( countries like Hungary Czech issue. solution buy vaccine Russia China ... approved vaccine available :( hand, (high risk plus older) parents eligible since end January hoping get weekend. appointments month ago got bumped due lack supply. also depends area luck, necessarily finesse. Exactly barely trusts doctors scientists. much land free. 
Maybe could tattoo un-vaccinated like Jewish WW2. Bet would go well. 
How else going know shot hasn't. [""It’s going disappear. One day — it’s like miracle — disappear. shores, — know, could get worse gets better. could maybe go away. We’ll see happens. Nobody really knows."" - Trump Feb article government signaled green tier something yellow tier. Okay....did need canned talking point response, sincere. Please don’t use platform scare others vaccinating, country needs heal. Good luck you. Yeah, make risk even lower? starts ""v."" surprise argument based strictly best alone. I'm honestly terrified inability country come together what's necessary defeat common threat us many unwilling look past self. bode well collective future. found guaranteed reason happen, it'd labelled racist.

Nice. right endanger public. live constant state fear? hilarious. mean “those million people there, know exist kind abstract sense they’re *real* people anything”? don’t believe think much all. Truthfully no, don’t think it’s something needs immediately dealt *this* scale we’re seeing; think it’s something dealt safely non-politicized way longer period time(not rushed vaccine, vaccines decade study they’re considered safe human use distribution.) Heart disease, don’t *need* eat foods, care personal health go ahead make choice stop eating them. Similarly Covid, don’t *need* go outside restaurants whatever may you’re you’re afraid getting Covid people aren’t vaccinated. Get vaccine act whatever way personally feel best. plenty ways stay safe Covid still live relatively normal life home(hint: country past year anyways). time, can’t force people stay inside afraid get sick. things dangerous one way another, like can’t force people stop eating junk food similarly can’t force people stay inside get vaccine. You’ll probably say it’s selfish get vaccine; equally selfish tell people put bodies everyday life want feel safe? We’ve already explored ways keep people safe, self isolate don’t want risk catching Covid- don’t expect inconvenience change lives millions people desires. people afraid getting change lives, shouldn’t expect lives around change want to.  remember, there’s always sunshine rain. get this! Oh ffas! people dumb!?! How!?!?! probably good time sell have. Things look really good year, likely next year. things drop back 3 years ago. Well maybe little better things learned apply cancer (mRNA vaccines already trial cancer treatment 3 years ago) research got nice boost, overall somewhere near peak. 

Note I'm advising shorting big pharma. know long things continue go up, far go. guy point. actually acknowledges reality human behavior makes projections gives advice. Can’t say blame them. You’re morons burned flag July 4 last year it’s wonderful celebration, lol I've many mixed feelings shopping eating since started. supporting workers bringing business making problem worse? always followed guidelines used make feel better still question it. surprising. I’ve said along deaths/hospitalizations go down, aren’t going able keep people home. What? Kurz right wing populist tries blame EU failures win people over. party friend vaccination steering board (vice president) responsible kind things, essentially criticizing himself. Nursing home scandal preceded Quote section think compelling properly sourced. Cause looks weak argument. everyone disciplined stayed house arrest two weeks, could worked! /s qualify, get it. There’s “right” time it. vaccination one step closer, waiting around trying fair isn’t anyone good. first time, it’s actually cool antisocial shut-in. People called heroes leaving houses. fookin bet devout Redditors never let go lockdown. ಥ_ಥ Wtf ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) sure left Italy once/if Lmao goddamn you’re loser would gold terrible money Well came, needs testing anyways. I'm pretty sure kind thing ever became law medical exemptions would included.

Would pretty stupid otherwise.

I'm saying vaccinated person high-risk fiancee. Oh, it’s time year amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

I’m seeing grandma next week 2.6% humans WORLD least first dose. Unreal. 

That seems low insane think many damn humans planet. support point. even read article. bother two. bother low effort comments. Maybe ball bag common phrase people NYC use they’re getting words wrong get special award posting banned subreddits? Literally almost everyone survives, yet we’re forced shut businesses take (potentially) mandatory unapproved vaccine. feel like blind man colt 45 song- something smells fishy. Lucky you, I'm construction worker rural NE FL, quarantine. took breaks slow downs worked usual actually pray get virus two week paid vacation. idea get home job pay worth damn chance working less without homelessness get sick. daily case threshold scheduled change orange yellow hit 4M vaccinations at-risk communities (HPI quartile 1). Scroll bottom. aware, propaganda looks like. This. Who's going give damn Covid fighting superintelligent metamorphosing cyber-viruses. woulda crushed buchenwald  Heck yeah. Love attitude. Keep 👍  can’t speak everyone it’s definitely weird feeling working. think really came whether support provided gov wasn’t. 

Most managers company’s 10+ years. close neighbors other. stayed late decorate holidays. We’ve lost friends family years. owners company genuine people I’ve ever met. That’s chose everything could help. us haven’t seen families also part keep safe worked. 

On one end I’m forever appreciative continued support community given us. think it’s travelers suck. There’s nothing like walking table telling flew hot spot visiting friends. worst friends turn group regulars. slap face willing starting point outbreak. also people I’d see social media parties different people weekend. they’d come sit section tell concerned, ignoring large amount sacrifice us chose make insure coworkers place return to. 

A lot people learned friends neighbors really are. opinion you’d like go so, follow establishment rules nice. It’s great see responsible familiar faces throughout this. It’s reason tried best stay open. genuine encouragement support refreshing worst times needed. slowing spread virus protecting vulnerable it. I'm 34 get flu shot every year think there's much chance flu seriously harm me, want get flu give grandma, etc. Plus, COVID considerably dangerous flu. 2.6 million people died COVID far, that's mitigation measures we've put place. virus eradicated existence?

Probably Never.

When go point give crap much like flu?(at least US)

Very soon. next months

r/ftfy president made sure whatever vaccine successful would it. Shit want reason USA position him. select countries position.  one suppose get food then? Grocery stores can't close. People work them, vaccinated not. discussion many times. People like conclusion therefore substituted benefitted them. know, selfish decision.

In fact course action recommended worked many places. problems mitigated major degree. Yet places people said ""I want"" fell apart. Also completely false assumption nothing would made things like normal. complete false narrative begin with.

btw...that bot deletion said f word you. ""I want"" part instead said ""FU"" start. Likely technically true intentionally misleading conflating ""COVID-19"" ""the COVID-19 pandemic."" Weird one explaining people risk get vaccinated won’t worry anymore. sub waves come everyone risk vaccinated put serious vaccine requirements healthy 28yr old I’m wasting time getting vaccinated something I’m risk poll bullshit. one supports crap notion. vaccine, salud, go live life. want mine longer impact you. someone explain (young healthy) get vaccine instead taking chances virus?

Because probably pass someone who's young healthy even know it. Sure there’s definitely parts transfer. miss able freshly prepped salad. Also I’m really sure kitchen usage going look like office get back, sounds messy slice avocado desk plastic knife (for example). total firstworld problem, I’m aware. thinking ways I’ve benefited WFH. 
I like shopping online I’ve saved lot money going restaurants much. sadden think leaving dog behind 9+ hours day it’s time go back! (She won’t home alone damn miss haha)  Good, needs go further. want clear: anyone eligible refuses vaccine allowed public setting all. Whatsoever. exceptions. I'm gonna get long haul covid get news Alex Jones think vaccine turn gay something. problem go around telling family members, hospitals faking Covid autopsies get money hospital therefore making fake real concern. Sadness nurses doctors supposed represent medical community ones spreading misinformation. problem people willing believe doctor. like cyber security administrator telling people definitely click suspicious link BS anyway essence, virus impacted us batshit disproportionate governmental response led destruction fabric society redefined means human. state opening everyone April 5. would say would get 80% end year. You’re always going 10-15% people never going get vaccinated, 20% wouldn’t get definitely change minds everyone else is. 3-4 weeks Backtracking vaccine? trashing vaccine?

Because DK people already talking lot AZ causing deaths etc. friend works nursing home refusing take 2nd shot. 1. Put tattoo everyone's forehead got vaccine

2. Invest popcorn companies

3. Profit surprised. People medical field taught treat *everything* degree skepticism. part, I've medical field long time, different roles. awhile worked company trying get product FDA approved. saw first hand shortcuts companies take. personally took shortcuts.

Companies like Pfizer Moderna... really blindly trust them. blind trust anyone, REALLY blindly trust billion dollar companies. We're still middle giant opioid crisis caused decades large pharmaceutical companies lying medical community general public.

The fact FDA approved guarantee safe. fact vaccine convenient solution major problem simply reason enough trust it.

Is vaccine safe? Probably. Could dangerous? Possibly. personally would like data making decision. Nothing wrong that. got it. using reverse psychology get want (which get vaccinated). flu vaccines exist, die it, society wave numbers dead's fault. Covid-19, option recently. people keep dying Covid well vaccines widely available, doubt people care flu deaths. (with exceptions) said brought upon getting vaccinated. think stick mask airplanes future. Asians wear masks time ""natural"" occurring virus arrived. Waiting progressive friends make fun then. cold flu past year, masks work!  say would change. Anti vaxxers refuse vaccine now. America, one's going throw jail refusing get vaccinated. harder time companies threatening fire employees get vaccinated, can't get airplane without proof vaccination, conventions let in, etc. Indeed think country X doesn’t want AstraZeneca vaccine, may mean lives lost country, long countries still want it, shouldn’t result net loss lives. countries wanted it, there’s likely darned good reason. Exactly someone bought Bill Melinda would say! everybody living constant fear. know plenty conservatives, liberals, don’t even knows living least level regular lives. Statements like make sound like everybody huddled away homes year. That’s simply false.

""Last Thursdayism"" philosophical concept Universe came existence (divinely otherwise) last Thursday set initial conditions give inside impression existed since last Thursday. 
 
The Christian version [omphalos previously heard went find source...interesting. 
 
The scientific method equations physics give us good approximation reality scientists know perfect pretty close, leaving plenty room rational person make sorts arguments. Since philosophical argument instead scientific one, never proven disproven. 
 
Also, creationists take timeline Bible literal, rather take allegory simpler abstraction reality one science given us last couple hundred years. Many self-identifying ""creationists"" believe Universe 13.8bn years old. 
 
I always love talking religious scientists, beliefs fall much wider spectrum nuance two diametrically opposed, incompatible ideas. get angry cause picked article support point. able cite actual executive order quote lets talk.

&amp;#x200B;

Got laugh one. vaccinate people physically capable leaving house spread virus stead vaccinating people going quarantine anyways? spending entire life quarantine would priority vaccination? Obv planners would rather virtue signal stead stopping spread virus. Anyone part (people medically unable excluded) help keep populace safe... allowed group setting. Certainly government-funded group setting (like school, federal offices, etc) South Park released documentary last night waste protocol lists already heavily used since 1/3rd people show appointments, least pharmacies. announced goal Dec. 8th. vaccines even started delivered. blow water? Heck yeah! mean ambitious announced it. Wanna know know kid? drive 40 hours month work. That’s 12 work weeks extra. Fuck...lol  apparently saying ANYTHING disparaging US gets downvoted here. 

The current narrative US gone shit-shot selfish. u/AriwakeTheGeek said US ***selfishly*** vaccinating everyone rapid pace, he'd get lots upvotes. mom actually believes this. thinks 5G radiation, causing COVID-19. I've spent dozens times trying explain 5G radiation weaker light see, EMF basically light (photons). MRI scanner fry me, much much weaker 5G harm?

I understand people come think ''yeah, that's logical.''

5G even set frequency anyway, like (for example) 5th Generation car specific make model car, simply means generation cars various manufacturers years.

Then again, there's unsettling number people genuinely think germs exist all, Earth flat snowglobe prison something... Actually rn license obtained 2 year degree. BSN, 4 year version. way decision political.. health authorities unbiased. Fair decession temp break, though bit annoyed, missing second shot. So, admitting problem part heal? Glad agree something. one main COVAX providers? look good. Oh definitely right, get threaten anyone else's life negligence get push jail time so. It’s easy determine drug causes clotting. 

I clotted birth control 2007. took years prove connection strong enough change formula bit. 

I also genetic mutation *correlated* higher rates clotting, still hasn’t proven cause blood clots. 

You can’t look many people clotted month two like “Nothing see here!”

If personally, history, would opt different vaccine. desire form clot go back meds least year. Anticoagulants aren’t fun take I’d rather avoid lifestyle choices. 

That said, live US don’t option get AZ anyway it’s really issue. Exactly. theme parks Orlando hitting capacity pretty regularly now. Granted, reduced capacity, still, lot people. know locals going, us aren't. vast majority visiting states/countries. Get this... know people think government put tiny black tracking bots vaccine track people. There’s much wrong scientifically thought. biggest flaw thinking everyone says smartphone. government track us anyway. use track Covid positive people sure quarantine. Pretty messed thinking. wonder many people read article definitely come across optimistic headline. Anecdotally, able get appointment problem Montana fwiw. I'm group 1B part education coworkers difficulties getting appointments either. I’d support idea. United States vaccinated four times amount people per capita Brazil has, isn’t really surprising.  Ha. That’s wants travel. US people fine giving away stay away gov control. 🙄 makes sense. Companies dress codes well. keep showing work shorts t-shirt office policy business casual, I'm certain I'll sent packing. Cool. Still getting one Good job making facts, vaccines ""typically take 10 years trial data approval"", talk detached reality. side effect vaccine happens couple months, things safe. mean feel free infect COVID lock couple weeks want make anti-bodies old fashioned way. vaccine basically infinitely safer. Generally tell live life normally. need people get infected placebo group measure effectiveness. mirrors happened major sports leagues 1 year ago; nobody wants first suspend, one did, scrambled follow suit, nobody wants last either. toilet paper! Always. point mind-boggling idiocy people lining admittedly experimental mrna ""vaccine"" less year trial data something 99.7% survival rate. seem real. point. super rough able many things love friends/family, man wait over, also going hard go back office. I'm fortunate able work home I've gotten used drive work, find working home less stressful I'm eating better getting exercise (walks). I'm saying want pandemic end - course - there's aspects actually better, gone. occurred right make health someone else’s responsibility? quick checking numbers looks like roughly 22 million people either work healthcare live nursing home US. CDC reporting 34 million people fully vaccinated, 30 million received one dose. looks like well beyond pool people.

What bothers Biden managed better plan Trump resources Federal government disposal last year. Countries EU obligation restrict AZ people 65. 100% indivudal countries.

As pushovers... mean, yeah. EU thinks reason everyone world acting good faith gets steamrolled it. maybe solution allow corporations loot country hard possible? Perhaps letting corporations sit back dictate lives dies via contract negotiation actual problem. 2 weeks crowd back Man, wonder global south trade China USA Europe ... right here.

That’s general public aren’t comprehending. vaccine experimental.
The speed developed ridiculous. Especially compared fastest ever created vaccine it, four years.

There’s possible way long term side effects known. wondering that, signed father California working office entire time, I'm pretty sure he's going one first job. convince let sign consider essential. He's manager though, needs set standard. LOL state still can't get REAL ID completely rolled out. Nice idea theory, never seem much luck large bureaucratic nightmares. mind wearing mask Walmart, breathing wet cloth training BJJ nonsense. internet 90% bots shills. Half comments aren’t real people. hope know now. lmao states already going May(last read, projection end April). Biden objectively better Trump ways, fucking ridiculous he'll come set bar that's already way met people praise like fucking anything. whole ""100 million vaccine doses 100 days"" shit again. you’re going equate 5% what? acknowledge moment it’s 5% sources back variants it’s even less. something recent show please do. None vaccines proven 100% efficacy preventing infection transmission studies data back sources two days ago. reduce chances. I've cautious year, line?

Time indicator long cautious. something wears there's stressor. Resist temptation give up. Treat like May, least, that's levels basically miracle vaccines effective, reduce COVID risk diseases seemed rare beforehand. wear masks distance then, right?

1. Vaccines work mostly herd immunity. also get less dramatic symptoms get it. still putting people risk vaccinated immune compromised. could get mild infection someone unvaccinated, pass someone unvaccinated, pass brother that's immune compromised, lives permanent lung tissue scarring necessitates use inhaler life much limited physical activity. everyone vaccinated, chance anyone getting infected first place would much lower infection rates would plummet chance transmission would lower every step example.

2. new variants can't predict whether one pop escapes current vaccine immune response. vitro results SA variant look bad. Rates need kept low possible minimize chance need 100% effective vaccine, mean, basically right?

Those ever exist. need eradication pandemic, perfect vaccine. What’s opinion mandatory vaccines kids enrolling schools? That’s common practice nowadays. hasn’t turned slippery slope, it’s considered vast majority unobjectionable policy.

Why adults different? 

(Also, factual matter, highly doubt vaccine ends once-in-century pandemic turn slippery slope forces people get “microchips.” One thing truly necessary; not.) California we've expanded past health care workers. They've vaccinated faculty grad students university. We’re working towards private gatherings going restaurants friends, we’re working move past open activities people don’t independent control over. things open opening, nice, idea need work TOWARDS people hang eachother shows complete misunderstanding people act. suggest consult different new sources! 

""The overwhelming majority vaccines produced EU goes EU supply,"" Soriot says, tacitly admitting least doses produced EU gone (and maybe still going) UK supply"" ""[AstraZeneca promised ship 20 million doses Canada CTV good enough source you? “For events, causal relationship Janssen COVID-19 vaccine cannot determined. assessment causality confounded presence underlying medical conditions may predisposed individuals events.” Maybe meant say authorities ""winging it"".

 *wing it*. attempt something little preparation advance; improvise. Reddit logic: employees rights unless right refuse experimental vaccine *enter George Washington, riding white horse emblazoned Johnson &amp; Johnson logo wielding massive syringe lance* Haha. Yeah, like ask clarification previous president said “magically go away”, magic came form vaccine created science. suspect he'll get vaccinated moment realizes none countries he's willing travel let unvaccinated passengers without multiple tests future. parent vaccinated? Doesn’t eliminate problem? what's wild flu approximately 100 deaths per day People ready get back normal they're literally anything happen, like said, family test dummies rushed vaccine. look I'm getting downvoted lol idk wtf happened sub man Exactly. schools require students get certain vaccines, understand workplaces can't same. Exactly. already cut people life following guidelines last year... feel safely vaccinated choose to. would want relationship people care little others? Much prefer spend time sense obligation communities. sure country in, I'm pretty sure true like 95% professions US. never show vaccination records get consulting gig DC (though go college, remember get vaccination going school doctor timed incorrectly something). Someone correct I'm wrong though.

And definitely right haziness EUA medicines. IANAL obviously, way EUA reads makes seem like illegal anyone force take it, would include employer.

I could see places WFH saying ""you can't come office get vaccinated"", long glaring differences way employees treated. Wow - words - ICU Delirium sounds horrifying. 

So glad you’ve made amazing comeback, wish best future!

FWIW, current level fitness much higher people know, included. Lol No, ONS survey random samples.

The big increase testing pretty much killed fall official case numbers, test numbers stabilise, see bigger falls. apply communicable diseases.  body that's risk. mean decide fulfill contracts…. It’s US 30 million doses….

Do think gave us goodness heart? No, contract them, doses belong us. It’s American people get decide go since bought them. huge reason. allow people get vaccinated. need fair wait everyone chance vaccinated run around want maskless. Biden said May wait till May otherwise needless lives lost inThe chaos young people pushing get vaccinated love life again. 

I understand sucks it’s fair thing. lost much last thing need tk create two tier society based age. know lot people 30 waiting chance tk get understand sacrifice greater good. need tk honor sacrifices rub dirt eyes. No. would pay politically said “RAGERS MEMORIAL DAY!” people couldn’t get vaccinated fast enough. Hedging correct move. also logistical problem although we're clients visit office yet meetings etc., might come point keen visiting offices willingly unvaccinated people. new version ""you're wearing mask, care don't?""

In cases, ignorant. Neither masks vaccines perfect, means safer *both* parties participate. Herd immunity relies large percentages population receiving vaccine; every ""I'm gonna free-ride others"" person reduces effectiveness lengthens time fully back normal.  Stay bunker antivaxxers let rest society get back normal thanks. hope they'll ready under-18 ages soon. Nope. j&amp;j jassen vaccine btw type astra, study showed increase thrombosis aka blood clots. read right fda faq yourself. Make pay monthly Covid test instead line vaccine. I'm definitely keeping surgical mask car on. case feel ""under weather"" errands go work (of course staying home best option). Hucksters - i.e. promote something questionable value. case, public health officials promoting COVID actions like lockdowns without looking entire public health picture said lockdowns quote Kulldorf states. What’s about? None accurate, it’s cautious. That’s fine, don’t claim accuracy studies disagreeing you. It’s fine wait info, correct isnt 0 don’t 100% story. link actual study (PDF): would liked clarify meant july 4th year since easter coming previous president's promise still come true need make sure enough people willing get them

More importantly, need make sure enough capacity administer them. state sitting 1.3 million unused doses.

If 60% population vaccinated June, still hard get appointment, things going stay shut July. 60% population vaccinated June, distribution centers empty there's wait, move reopen everything immediately. Yes, media went spin everything dude says wonderful. agree you. point certain people run around make point let know didn't, get vaccinated, wearing mask. someone safety concerns, stays responsible, wears masks, socially distances, course right. would hope world pulls said vaccines, person would jump board. survived long Yes deltoid recommended. really basic like flu shot really. significant ""change"" longer monitoring (15 minutes usually, 30 patients) allergy alerts. I'm periodontist. I've seen concern dentists giving it. Giving intramuscular injection WAY easier giving block mouth. would completely comfortable hygienists give shot.

Fair enough. But, that's introvert means* Though think segment population falls adequate socialization very, small. 

*Nothing personal lots people Reddit incorrectly defining introvert means. means shy quiet person still one like public. mean someone like interact person gets anxious happens. Canada agreement AZ 20 million doses, supplied US. 

We signed separate agreement Serum Institute India 2 million doses vaccine (same product, made different location basically). Stop. zero scientific evidence reinfection happening noticeable rate even variants. Memory cell antibody immunity strong, body’s immune system adapting unimaginably long.  Wait Two Weeks(tm)! year 2023. Italy imposing 28th lockdown. Politicians urge calm 40% population vaccinated 2025. Meanwhile, EU exports 50 million vaccines daily effort vaccinate lemurs worldwide. I've submitted mask worry. Can't force wear mask I'm wearing already. legal. Really, said. get card name date vaccination? sure hope Texas. computer admin services 300+ people travel three different bldgs labeled ""essential"". bit frustrating. I'm crossing fingers. first two planning fully approved April. Can’t use argument much longer it’s approved. Discrimination faced negative consequences are. you’re facing negative consequences foolish choices. We’ll probably need get covid shot every year, maybe every six months. makes wonder though, block coronavirus vaccine, could block coronavirus strains vaccine? rhinovirus? Could end common cold know it? I’d like see science says it. I’d guess medical-pharmaceutical complex would opposed, would mean lots lost revenue, that’s cynic talking. there’s data shows would work, public might demand it. reality majority people favor things, posts manufactured media, voted front page bots, comment threads filled shills talking great is.

We entering new age. privacy even rights bodies. like 5th lockdown. family Italy sounds like third world country now. hope realize means vaccines produced EU mean company sell EU otherwise free market claim.

You fucking idea talking about.

The facts are, vaccines already sold company wants fulfill order tapping US supply line.

The US stopping it, yeah.. they're interfering free market. Yes. Pfizer vaccine (and presumably Moderna due high degree similarity two) show significant drop ability neutralize P1 B.1.1.7 variants. Pfizer shows reduced, still robust, neutralization South African variant. Thus, compared neutralization USA-WA1/2020, neutralization B.1.1.7-spike P.1-spike viruses roughly equivalent, neutralization B.1.351-spike virus robust lower Given Italy exactly that, (while supported contries France) think EU single reason complain. Turns out, events still cancelled things closed, don’t much choice I? least guys plan. Texas even clarifying eligible various phases, phases begin. Idk manl, remember accounts earlier days virus saying ""hell take vaccine, rushed it!"" ones praising begging like crackhead wanting his/her next hit, odd flipped script quickly, maybe they're getting paid, maybe quarantine fatigue. definitely odd point it’s clear AZ going PR problems US beyond baseline vaccine hesitancy. I’d prefer doses go COVAX EU actually get shots arms (which seems least somewhat doubt) release them. claiming vaccine nationalism explains Europe’s horrific rollout? elaborate? 

I would argue UK America quite “nationalistic” vaccine rollout seen amazing success. Exactly. reality antisocial behavior rewarded benefits society. people think pull weight public health perspective first line send people commit crimes prison life, unable see hypocrisy.  Right? Doesn’t feel like ten? Well 1/3rd population usually ones suck tourists anyway...so I'm fine planes traveling Dubai certainly awful place. still slaves fucks sake. horrific record human rights abuse well. Avoid place dignity respect fellow humans. 30,000 huh?  We’re effed. It’s literally announced news week likely reach herd immunity late summer vaccinations alone idea find batch number I’m worried might another “you go back normal Easter” 1st shot Moderna, arm sore 18 hours. that, nothing. 
2nd shot reactions save minor pain injection site lasted couple hours. issues all. Tomorrow two weeks since 2nd shot. sleeping better night weight lifted shoulders. feels like freedom again. got hug kid first time year yesterday. Know someone drove Canada Florida (vacation), went get vaccine drive thru clinic thing like nothing. even ask ID see Florida. What?? Cool! argument made legality constitutionality, comment would relevant actually useful point.

Unfortunately, mention either solely talking personal level over-the-top sounds. please notice 0.002% spread year 0,00044% within days vaccination. actually could indicate something.  least worth investigating didn’t read comment replied to. critical difference vaccines FDA approved; matter many times people repeat it, no, *not* undergone testing fully approved vaccines. 

EUA requires follow 2 months far softer target hit vaccine treatment “benefits outweigh risks”. Unfortunately big assumption US reach herd immunity many anti-vaxers, knew high percentage people going get might agree, need push every single person get vaccine point. american pharma generating profit vaccines? I'm pretty sure almost vaccines makers agreed sell vaccine cost. yeah sure blame EU member countries banning vaccine, blame the... US! Makes sense could argue AZ extended get contracts can't fulfill.

This different saying place like Costco asking customers return toilet papers could fulfill demand. Yes, logical request one would never work real life.

Overall agree purely political move though unfortunately can't say US fault reaction EU. say politics stupid though.  stupid comparison. understand it’s pain many people don’t chance tk vaccinated. alone it’s best wear sacrifice asking make wasted. 

My biggest issue large amount people younger waiting patiently allowing others go 1st.
In US probably 1,000s people want BJJ without mask even offered vaccine offered think it’s ethical allow want, till sacrificed would able get shot.  AZ also delivered vaccines EU facilities UK, yet didn’t want use UK facilities EU delivery. Shady. Dubai! Nice!! seems like awesome place. Completely agree! nervous getting mine since first tier, felt reassured saw lot healthcare workers friends posting getting theirs. encouraged sign sooner originally planning. God, psychology Americans won’t something want simply tell to, need grow up.  Numerical imbalances, events vaccine placebo recipients, observed following serious non-serious adverse events interest individuals receiving vaccine placebo, respectively:

Thromboembolic events:
Deep vein thrombosis: 6 events (2 serious) vaccine recipients versus 2 events (1 serious) placebo recipients
Pulmonary embolism: 4 events (3 serious) vaccine recipients versus 1 event (serious) placebo recipients
Transverse sinus thrombosis: 1 event (serious) vaccine recipients versus 0 placebo recipients
Seizures:
4 events (1 serious) vaccine recipients versus 1 event (0 serious) placebo recipients
Tinnitus (ringing one ears):
6 events (0 serious) vaccine recipients versus 0 placebo recipients
For events, causal relationship Janssen COVID-19 vaccine cannot determined. assessment causality confounded presence underlying medical conditions may predisposed individuals events. 

""Cannot determined"" ""may have"" mean relationship either suggesting. tell ppl. way anti-vac. wait till sure safe. clear, directing states allow adults get line getting vaccine. still take lot time vaccinate everyone wants one get safe herd immunity levels. call common sense!! tell this. covid February ears felt funny. literally told husband hope getting ear infection (ear infections adult worst!). end full blown ear infection ears definitely felt funny. Shoot, depending pain would go sure infected wake middle night excruciating pain. Antibiotics knock back quickly. rights infringed still hired work home? Ah yes Twitter apparently best place get news from. searched quote that’s place it’s from, hardly good source there. 

Also, Soriot said tacitly admit anything like that. quote says doses exported (such due go Australia), gives indication destination. level journalism nothing indicate good unbiased source literally added opinion fact.

So summarise can’t provide source shows Soriot saying that. someone Twitter put words mouth make point. Oh yeah mean future ofc. Obviously since it’s available everybody. ""If anything said lies ahead, it’s pandemics end whimpers, headlines. one end many small ways, day day, concrete instances triumph progress pull us forward. ways, pandemic going drag on, virus us indefinitely. question degree.""

This good news. Send office. Let vaccinated folks stay home ;) really enlightening watch. Watching people trade personal privacy exchange for, well, guess ""medical security"" fascinating. know decides what's fraud, what's criminal negligence, what's contractional issue? Public prosecutors employed EU, prosecutors working governments member countries, government(s) screwed over. take solace potentially right here. fact sizable proportion population suffering immensely pandemic, others thriving (economically) going wealth gap, embolden systemic socioeconomic barriers success. it’s true. Nowhere constitution document say right comfort. Canadians accusing US stalling vaccines bailing asked actual proof? Big surprise. mean, us assume would case, anyway? really question adults would eligible May 1st(barring major fuck government).  it’s also choice deal consequences that. Airlines already starting implement vaccine passports. don’t right comfort fun.

That's little top. actually important shows acceptance vaccines. need ease it. I'm behavior health technician whose gotten shot fully vaccinatined. I've experienced fear wearing masks. I've started therapy routine... logically know safe like vaccinated.

But I've started little things everyone wouldn't. 

I got pedicure. got food hot food bar. I'll go drive without mask. went dentist. visited friend also vaccinated (this last thing nervous.) I'm trying work eating restaurant.)

Any anxiety reminded much shots proven effective. choice recommend getting pfizer moderna. There's still lot anxiety I'm hopeful gradual exposure things enjoy anxiety lessen. It’s going hard see people without masks, might little anxious. Reinfection still extremely rare, variants not. see people pushing back vaccine required X, available age group yet. conflicting yourself, logic vaccines first owned company producing whoever company decides sell to.

So, hope realize means vaccines produced EU mean company sell EU otherwise free market claim. It’s funny passionately defend people harming communities name personal freedoms. see need embrace balanced approach, cultivate culture people value personal freedom responsibility community? change culture, know. 

It isn’t hard litmus test... person’s freedom choose harms community (eg choosing wear mask pandemic despite aren’t using another method prevent spreading virus), freedom take priority community’s wellbeing. ￼Instead embracing culture narcissism, need embrace culture empathy balance.  pleasure!

Come on, everyone. Say “yes” vaccine! Example: Bulgaria didnt buy full allotment BionTech, went back pool counties could buy - Denmark bought additional 2.6mill BionTech doses back December. would mean Denmark receive Bulgaria.

That seems like fair solution redristibuting untaken doses - however know transparant fair process was.

Others ones making happen sure trying place trump recipient praise gross humor. dark kinda humor reserved uncles still saying racial jokes. CDC botched pandemic get-go, namely telling us wear masks first weeks pandemic. trustworthy advice IMO.. proof money get medical degree doesn’t exactly make smart.

I'm rush get either. like get right anyway. Enjoy rest freshman year. High school stressful blast too. good news way shape form. everyone thinks way one gets vaccinated rely everyone else everyone else thinking thing. collective action problem. 

Also, Person literally everything could protect themselves. Person A's parent might vulnerable allergic reaction would make getting vaccine dangerous. Here, Person Person A's parent everything right. Person B not. People felt ""sorry"" work person.

I'm sure vaccine safe faulty batch always happen.  Absolutely. I’m curious people worst mental health mental health problems pre covid. 

For adjustment I’m happy pre covid, I’m sure I’ll heaven everything returns normal. 

I tend really happy, adaptable, optimistic person tho. fault that’s I’m wired. 

I also incredibly good circumstances low stress lifestyle. feel completely touch everyone says pandemic ruining lives. Regardless whether right things do, restrictions pushed goal fighting pandemic, directly led mental health crisis many people having.

Again, maybe best intentions, every intentions actions taken (unintended) consequences that's now. You’re free stay home want to. FDA thr US approval body whereas EUA simply stands emergency use authorisation allows vaccines authorised extremely quickly situations like global pandemic since full FDA approved takes long remember someone doctors office wearing mask years ago- wouldn’t get flu shot. Hell yeah sub one post 6 subscribers? Yup, think would gain telling would 500000 fatalities US first quarter year ends? could would gain anything value panick-inducing doom spells journalism. care sales numbers alone. Fingers crossed. You’d think getting ill dying would incentive enough causing someone else get ill die.  Yeah can't believe EU's stupid, vaccinate people first. Idiots. value vaccines like do? /s

Then soon someone mentions EU stop exporting vaccines vaccination campaign behind followed ""What mean stop exporting us? That's unfair! Us export EU? course not, contracts, first come first serve."" random UK redditors. feel like crawl social networks flag medical staff like complaint hear legit pain patients they’re getting legit doctors doesn’t handle pain. go search of...and troubling. Fwiw there's chance hell pill would pass modern regulator despite already use. side effects crazy. Semantics.
You get point. Thanks Donald J Trump Operation Warpspeed! town lost favorite small businesses.

My small rural hometown completely different place now. Losing small business obviously hurts larger cities — town 5 local restaurants begin lost 3 them, way harder blow.

I feel reasonably confident businesses current neighborhood (in major US city) eventually replaced something new someday. like new businesses lining set shop rural America. Companies can’t impose illegal requirements employees; human sacrifice (murder) illegal discrimination skin color gender also illegal protected classes. two examples poor analogies requiring employees get vaccinated working/hiring.

There *might* issue vaccines aren’t fuller authorized (it’s emergency use authorization currently), we’re middle pandemic think it’s pretty reasonable it’s unlikely they’ll face much legal trouble general vaccination requirements. biggest issue think attempting enforce vaccination requirements people can’t receive medical reasons, Americans medical disabilities legal protections (if recall correctly. think they’re protected class?). That’s fine.

But don’t require it.


Hey, look way. people get vaccine protected “anti” people. cares don’t get right? Reference please. research read says still long way go. mean? choice decline vaccine, civilized society choice exclude you. You’re okay forcing people livelihoods inevitably starve lose homes? government right impose that, can’t think anything less American advocating government given sort power, especially given recent history. 

African Americans would disproportionately impacted this, statistically group skeptical vaccine, good reason given unethical medical experiments carried community. That's fine dont want it. getting plane people do. want ignorant fuck others need suffer it. Lot people seem getting second stab today. fantastic! Soon enough, i'll joining people feel immensely guilty OK own. mean, wife animals keep company I'm truly alone, reading terrible everyone else makes feel bad year impact way. hope everyone reading fantastic rest 2021 able get support help need. JNJ? company sued recently baby powder linking towards cancer? think I'm supposed trust them? editing need someone. proof read. couple authors.  source - guestimating lol. professions know require vaccination records education healthcare maybe government/military.

Healthcare + teachers 25 million people ~8% US population. could feel passion/identity dying well. sure growing something specific experiencing pandemic could tell creative used be. 

Thankfully I've felt sort shift past week, ago tried making point get sort creative work (writing/video editing particular me) done nightly basis, kind bit-by-bit, recently started feel natural again. Oddly, big part getting first vaccine dose, psychologically feels like part brain dedicated wondering personally start living freely again, least end-date that. hope feel hope, feel like picking work novel again, see completion Pre-pandemic: 165 lbs, 10% body fat, 3x bodyweight deadlift, 2.5x body weight squat, 1.5x bodyweight bench, 1x body weight overhead press.

Post-pandemic: 170 lbs, 20%ish body fat, gym closed massively restricted entire time. Live tiny apartment room workout. ride bike, got run behind (while stopped light) workout all. Severe depression.

I understand restrictions, hard feel like society traded health someone else's. voter, disagree. now? now. 

OK then. surprise me, keep seeing changes crop (rather different ways achieving thing) I'd love see source. Obviously that’s exception. referring fact op young goal date vaccination 50 days May 1st Biden said last night. give OP chance get vaccinated go hug family lot less worry. It’s sucks we’re pretty close.

As anyone wants wait point. fate hands hope send Texas immunocompromised come play without worry. It’s crazy think still pockets people susceptible virus don’t believe it. Darwinism. explained million times developed quickly, including new technology, unprecedented funding, importantly rampant community spread allowing trials meet endpoints far quicker viruses/infectious diseases, people simply saying 'it much faster must dangerous' 'long term side effects' (when vaccines fundamentally lie latent body years manifest crazy side effects - effects typically present 60 days less trials ongoing 9 months anyway). Crazy thing, years clinical data vaccine safety... yet average vaccine tested 6-10 years. fastest ever prior COVID one took 4 years developed...

But one developed 8-9 months perfectly safe!

Weird honestly worries rhat people working healthcare refusing vaccine Grandkids everywhere: Hooray! locked due comment section becoming mudslinging contest. Well force involved. Nobody’s forced. don’t NEED get plane unless you’re traveling work. Otherwise it’s entertainment purposes.  cannot mandate experimental vaccine. propaganda. still emergency approval status still global pandemic emergency. cannot even give people declared pandemic unless officially gets approved. Anyone know happened COVID hospitalization data (US)? enjoying watching drop everyday, seems like updated trackers follow since March 7th. That's math though. number killed lockdowns vs. number killed COVID. number killed lockdowns vs number *saved* lockdowns. 

How many would died lockdown instead told people ""Hey. There's virus. spreads really quickly, airborne, deadly people 75. also seems primarily affect people obese Vitamin deficiencies. Everyone make best judgment yourself?"" frustrating. I’ve lifting decades, went weight pull-ups, weighted dips, weighted push-ups, etc. honestly I’ve stayed good shape year normal, lost little mass surprisingly.

Now done less cardio really affected cardio fitness greatly. seen site schedules vaccines 2 weeks There's many people put arms. vaccine world there's many hours day adjusted lives entire year sure, soft. school/college kids literally got greatest years taken away them.. saying blood clot claims even legitimate alot medications millions people take daily come blood clot warnings. example, contraceptive pillw known cause 3-10 DEATHS per million blood clots yet pulled shelves media creating giant shitstorm !!NEWSFLASH!! sometimes benefits outweigh side effects. question already thing? general public aren’t comprehending. vaccine experimental. speed developed ridiculous. Especially compared fastest ever created vaccine it, four years.

There way know long term side effects anything definition. always chance polio vaccine give great-great-great grandchildren disorder 100 years, never know time occurred yet definition. Lmfao, get real. people delusional think you’re going able force people get this. cant get vaccine lmao Dude, made fool yourself. accept defeat move on. yep. we're point. likely it'll last easter vaccinate consistently. going go one long ass bougie vacation money saved working home nothing..I deserve it, Last shot Feb 10. Visited daughter's house yesterday grand daughter's fifth birthday party. Hugged grandkids daughter. Shook hands son-in-law. Feels good able socialize. got second dose Pfizer 2 weeks ago.

Basically felt fine 12 hours injection, body went fuss decide hot cold night.

When got bed morning still going little bit less felt crappy. felt kind hungover like half day went away. I'd say 24-27 hours shot side effects mostly gone could never support this. don’t agree forcing people take don’t want it. Feb. 1, response question asking vaccine come approved Health Canada, AstraZeneca spokesperson said AstraZeneca signed sub-licensing partnership Serum Institute India manufacture vaccine. spokesperson said Mississauga-based Verity Pharmaceuticals supporting Serum Institute India regulatory registration, importation distribution vaccine country following Health Canada approval. many unknowns due time. long term effects virus/variants obviously impact people with) without symptoms? fuck happened ""if sick stay home"" Yeah, c'est la vie. Well, spoken bullied grade school... could got laws changed town mentioning it, apparently. US sick leave isn’t required people can’t afford take time without pay, terminated calling sick. It’s screwed system negatively impacts people need most. actually read source says? says Switzerland exempt vaccine *controls* *limits* bloc could block export vaccine determined could undermine EU's supplies. European Commission however stressed export ban.

We actually saw happen Astra Zeneca export Australia reasonable rule. company far blocked limited comes exports. initially worried would low uptake second shot, far doesn’t seem problem. need first shots tho Eh think airlines definitely rights phrased correctly. example could say “either show vaccination card pay $5000 decontamination testing fee.” Also you’re flying different country, definitely refuse entry lack proper vaccinations. occurs world Nobody’s forced reagan ""taxcuts"" made UE benefits taxable Point Democrats partisan bigoted Republicans. happens using skin color wasn’t insulting used things. making excuses behavior backs true is.

And make random insult end? typically explained way learn many wonderful creations lord. Many Christian churches creationists, believe mysterious unknowable power God. alt-left knight child? would never guessed username like that. Stop throat? point? know something wrong throat?  Meditation increase ability focus, increase ability enact social change Oh ok. Probably best trust random redditors then. Covid Tracking Project shut March 7th. I'm guessing trackers sourced data there. CDC hospitalization stats here: Yupp mutations big reason need pretty much force everyone getting vaccinated. virus still continues spreading among anti vaxxers there’s good chance it’ll eventually mutate something vaccines longer effective too. I've extremely lucky, objectively, real positives situation. come robust background mental health wise problems nowhere near severe many others. Yet caused problems hard articulate. get certain company's shot, locked company? Pfizer first shot, obviously get Pfizer second shot part regiment... ""Pfizer Dude"" getting Pfizer boosters every year? get Moderna J&amp;J booster/shot 2022? Wonder work. we're moving open need open eligibility well lot - saying vaccinated person worried unvaccinated people

And that's wrong. isn’t obvious, advocate evaluating they’re saying merits anything. However, refuse something simply comes authority figure childish. reverse psychology work too? you, six?  really get reddit hive mind totalitarian forcing EUA injections people's bodies own. bizarre. surprised emotional jab made me. Didn’t cry, teary-eyed bit. whole year stress really built slowly, it’s hard catch dissolves, even temporarily. I’ve also volunteered vaccination site saw good number people weeping cars post-shot waiting area. 15 minute observation period actually perfect allow folks collect lol. got first shot Sunday. nurse started talking 15 mintute waiting area. brought crazy close end places like Texas getting rid mask mandates. said mandated. started talking Dr. Seuss. smiled (under mask), nodded. get argument. yeah, propaganda seems really getting rid common sense. real trained professionals. EEOC 

**K.7. happens employer cannot exempt provide reasonable accommodation employee cannot comply mandatory vaccine policy disability sincerely held religious practice belief?** *(12/16/20)*

If employee cannot get vaccinated COVID-19 disability sincerely held religious belief, practice, observance, reasonable accommodation possible, would lawful employer employee workplace.  This mean employer may automatically terminate worker.  Employers need determine rights apply EEO laws federal, state, local authorities.

&amp;#x200B;

so EEOC excerpt alone condones Mandatory Vaccine Policies, gives stop gap solution people claim disability religion exclude vaccine. dangerous covid? Based what? Dumb different bad missing point 🍪 extent stories deaths vaccine administration reported news outlets, great example properly: 

-Makes clear, bold lettering, right bat yet conclusive link death vaccination

-States investigation pending information needed

-Explains cause death one typically seen vaccines

-Provides reasoning reported: unusual, young person, deaths vaccination investigated thoroughly

-Makes clear update information becomes available.


This responsible journalism looks like. Legal enforcement one way society controls members. de-facto enforced fact going hard time anything refuse get vaccinated. people want avoid hassle it, hardcore ""don't tread me"" anti-vax folks refuse. big majority people want activities unvaccinated people restricted according article, they're going make happen one way other. maybe proof humans complex creatures determining intelligence worth single-threaded issue reductive slippery slope. 

Note: vaccinated, pro-vax. I'm freedom speech videos lowered already low IQ Medical racism...? Serum Institute world’s biggest vaccine manufacturing company. EU hasn’t got round authorising yet... body choice experimental emergency authorized vaccines lmao.

You're exposing bit much motivations. I'm well aware reports show people getting sick. must make decision based know trust. I've met people talked directly. 3 lot? worth noting 3 3 got little cold. fact symptoms even cold related. didnt get runny nose fever. chills cold sweats felt completely drained. spouses mentioned simple touch leg shoulder caused pain. I'm aware stats reports say. I'm also suspicious good reason. often Gov give something free strings attached? often drug vaccine 0 possibly dangerous side effects? often drug rushed quickly? many questions concerns I'd like know take it. I'm saying anyone else wait. I'm gonna do. comment thread removed entirely. Tbh UK AZ plant would barely enough export. think produces like 2m doses week most. That's fine small country like UK looking export even help EU all. Let's say gave half doses EU. Thats 1m week across 27 EU countries population 400m. point even bother exporting all. Might start planning 4th July party friends seen year now. Looking forward summer. Unsure point? 2000 election ultimately determined Supreme Court. Bound backlash that. Additionally, easy throw criticism toward administration got us two wars, easy protest furthering policies 2004.

So again, unsure point. thanks admission people indeed protest Obama skin color. That's progress, learned something today. exactly thought read this. policy like could encourage people vaccinated. plenty hate about.

I'm genuinely curious, like what? 

Because saying kind mean. people can't understand anyone would ""**hate**"" man appearances kind, empathetic, well-meaning, intelligent, hard working, charismatic, earth, genuine. 

It raises question: character excellent, else could people judging viciously on?  there's pretty glaring possible answer question...

Even policy level, what'd do? Tried expand healthcare coverage people? Tried disarm Iran's nuclear program diplomacy? certainly disagree tried things. really **""hate""** someone them? Adenoviral vector vaccines like JnJ AZ used years, difference spike protein develop antibodies against. 

mRNA vaccines whilst newer arguably safer traditional vaccination methods mRNA rapidly degraded reduces risk mutagenesis. Issue someone reaction there’s good way respond due many cars track are, granted reactions minor Vaso-Vagal syncope fear needles, one two people go anaphylaxis due unknown allergy need airtight. done, needs done right uses lot resources people people realize might short matter time. struggling get one week appears breeze either due lower demand vaccine availability. last sentence covers perfectly. 

Not mental health go complete shit, I'm also increasingly deteriorating physical health.

And coming someone covid back March 2020.

I mean where's line? one talking trade here? infuriating. Bingo, nailed it. Although spend decent portion time internet, usually researching stock strategies, looking better care fish, trying start writing novel keep putting off... Well Madam (since apparently we’re assuming things) end February I’m sure end January would relevant even correct isn’t one India approved 6th Jan. 

Well done, don’t know didn’t start instead going random Twitter comments. doesn’t really confirm anything new though, knew EU factories used doesn’t really show vaccine it’s entirety EU fill finish done EU start. However, least support said extent thanks providing it. Remember time said take unapproved vaccine? Good times, good times. still people think big deal. \~600k people probably gonna die thing time said done US, still people arguing lockdowns much masks stupid. Ugh that's awful, I'm sorry deal :( Uhm aren’t exporting mostly vaccines companies delivering vaccines us according schedule? 

We kind diverse portfolio vaccines aren’t quite ready. botched purchase vaccines cheap playing politics like purchasing Sanofi instead Pfizer due French protectionism. 

We’re currently issues AZ. Pfizer said point expecy delays weekly deliveries, quaterly deliveries afaik contract. 

So basically don’t many AZ vaccines ordered also aren’t using AZ vaccines have. Remind society care health wellbeing vaccinated everyone chance opportunity get vaccinated? someone wants continue roll dice vaccinated person's problem worry them? 

(Yes, cannot get vaccinated medical reasons limited group talking them.) Dukes too, going total shit show  People asking predictions want political predictions, since effects pandemic people’s lives come political decisions shut down. mandate masks. absolutely give specific predictions this, it’s Fauci isn’t one giving them. authority it. 

“How long going shut job down. long suffer poverty.” Fauci’s control. It’s whoever decided implement actions resulted person’s life crumbling’s control. that. Give full approval. EAU mandate would slippery slope. first official suggestion normalcy start return Summer. He's basically already saying throw 4th July outdoor parties. Still plenty room expand speed timeline. I'm encouraged this, first offical mention return normalcy national scale. Many nurses religious fanatics. Doctors excuse.

However think lot doctors/nurses refusing since they’d already fairly recently infected didn’t think need yet. I’ve seen lot “I’ll get one, don’t want first group”...which may uninformed given lengthy trials, still rational first shot Monday reality starting sink may return office within two months. Heartbreaking. seems common nurses doctors I've seen. Yes, doctors pushing antivax weird doctor, I've seen antivax sentiment nurses. blame lack rigorous basic science education BSNs. wild little science part education exactly shouting about? massive trials done low rates adverse events, approved vaccines extremely effective. They're going approved soon six month mark met. making points comment. never understand scientists creationists either. madness. remember reading one Paleontologist, like wtf. *Your job literally disproves beliefs?!* Yeah man, problems ever risen blindly following authority. You’re right, always listen rulers without question. Ok it’s March rapidly turning April. I’ve seen several stories recently people stopped countries ask post curfew. 

The US gotten flack handling pandemic I’m glad haven’t reached point. Indiana opens teachers Monday higher education isn’t included. Incredible Denialists prove fifth grade education challenge: germ theory work? Socialization even 5 hours day would absolutely destroy me. noise alone trying listen people really listen draining me. usually headaches seeing friends, joke.

That best way could put understand extrovert feels like right now. I'm sorry things rough you. Yes does. point young redditors incapable dealing level risk regarding virus. odds parent dying situation virtually zero. congrats Exactly. right vaccinated work person without mask, right safe illness virus. 

Medical exceptions vaccination withstanding. Real Medical exceptions, ""my arm hurts days get vaccinated"" Right work states entered chat... drop simplify issue. couple days call blood people find donate No, it’s still discrimination, illegal discrimination. Businesses allowed discriminate time; paying customers non-customers, high-level employees low-level employees, etc...

It becomes illegal involves discriminating protected sure talking directing states open vaccine talking goals around pandemic

Are actually mentally challenged? post directing states open eligibility comment... basic reading comprehension beyond you?

Ok, point assume IQ average potted plant. states already saying going open eligibility *in fucking April*. Biden swooping saying ""direct states"" open eligibility *May* essentially trying take credit something already going happen. like said goal get 100 million vaccine doses 100 days... rate already slightly 1 million doses day. Biden literally said campaign vaccine end Trump's term. also made 100 million vaccinations 100 days goal administration, 1 million day already reached took office. also vice president voicing mistrust vaccine political gain election, Trump pushing it.

The amount vaccines going regardless election. difference administrations Biden's administration changed tune became politically expedient. going different everyone, never go office would happier it. Practically speaking there's going things go back office get done, that's fine, otherwise could always work home would wonderful. people difficulty transitioning working working home, issue that. day done put computer sleep I'm non-working mode. clean break, problem. Good. love I’ve “essential worker” still don’t qualify vaccine even though come contact people 90% people do. two facts hidden dismissing IFR, already much higher similarly contagious evenly distributed. IFR high immune compromised. elderly, pregnant, steroids etc, diseases compromise immune negative outcomes aside death.

This true influenza well many transmissible diseases. cannot base response pandemic solely desire protect small, vulnerable group people - society would permanent lockdown. Biden media everything power prolong pandemic. vaccine works key ending shit. get vaccine wait appropriate time work, able go 100% back normal. fact guy said he's working towards ""small gatherings"" July 4th proves lost is. everyone access vaccine, May, there's reason go back normal restrictions. Telling people can't go 100% back normal getting vaccine convince people get first place. evidence clear significantly prevents death, hospitalizations, TRANSMISSION. messaging surrounding vaccine fucking frustrating. truly hope you’re right.... it’s unlikely It’s like playing Russian roulette revolver several hundred bullet slots, still single bullet it, bullet chance even hurt. received card showing vaccinated, date, vaccine . US, CDC. restrictions talking exactly? think hundred vaccines left UK soil, so, prove wrong. fact know EU exporting vaccines. 

If anything think EU putting stop exports would bring US UK table come agreement exports, ""only EU stupid enough it"". US factories supposed exporting too. violent agreement. Good day sir. constitution gives right force people take experimental drug allowing people 60 targeted health problems get vaccine?! would impressive opening phase. I'm 65, got second shot last week, two-thirds people much younger. Sixty included right now. correct take, u/SpectrumofMidnight, sad see people voting it. 

Per CDC stats, vaccines exceptionally awesome. March 8, 92 million doses given, 1,600 people died short term receiving vaccine. deaths causality-linked... in, people's deaths attributed vaccine likely coincidentally timed near vaccine shot, causes. 

But *even worse case scenario assuming linked vaccine*, still 0.0018% receiving vaccine dose. One's odds dying covid several orders magnitude higher.

We're going get point 25% population keeps terrible disease alive potentially spreading immunocompromised non-vaccinated people, continuing choice refuse insanely-low-risk vaccination shot. That's totally conscious morally abhorrent choice 1) consequences attached 2) allowed mechanism place need protected fallout it. Reconsidering never-ending, draconian restrictions? Targeting at-risk demographics, opposed blanket restrictions affecting lives people virus poses virtually risk? fully expect similar level ""supply"" issues closed down, opposite activities.

Thank things.

However, things alone enough end pandemic unless everyone world simultaneously isolates 2 weeks, logistically impossible.

A vaccine accomplishes preventive measures not. Literally liberals forced nursing homes accept Covid pts / lied / forced old people isolation killing got dementia. 

Then audacity say charge wouldn’t deaths. Fact liberals charge deaths worse. Trump travel ban early saved countless lives. speed trump administration developed vaccine saved countless lives. say Biden magical wand could’ve waived silly delusional. could say ton fields. people associate apologies admitting mistakes weakness incompetence applauded.

Best birthday present I'll ever get 🙌 something Agreed. Two things keep mind: First, currently almost million licensed physicians United States. Therefore, find one even dozens even thousands endorse almost point-of-view. Unfortunately, way social traditional media works days, message amplified around world confirmation bias-hungry audience instantly. Secondly, 4 million nurses currently US depending type nurse, get license seven months college degree. I’m demeaning profession trade, shit ton nurses though competent skills trained, lot haven’t gone kind rigorous post HS *intellectual* work often sharpens academic critical thinking skills, makes one aware heuristics seasons one evaluate sources discerning criteria. Yeah, totally ban people whose opinions completely align own, right? /s Yeah wife stories would walk around vaccines ask date. weren’t you’d get vaccinated spot. restrictions talking exactly?

Antibody tests positive vaccine, also negative even though immunity exists. time, reliable way test vaccine-induced immunity. That's nice decide people travel can't sources I've read, yes seems like 100% known yet Wondering thing  continued grappling exact reason moron. Sheesh. mean, people already threw large 4th july parties last year well. I'm 'cautious' state lakes PACKED last year. CDC, even extreme conservative nature, already given green light vaccinated folks gatherings others low risk. Normality already returning number states. He's wayyy behind saying quite frankly touch. People keep saying CDCs position masks. said masks shortly said yes masks. 

And consistent like 10 months now. hasn’t flip flopping. allowed update stance receive new data.  That's sound goalposts moved infinity know EU mandated vaccine exports transparent. know many vaccines exported exported EU intervened.

It *is* known Dutch plant contracted AZ (Halix) has, indeed, exported UK UK still ramping production. Another reason hesitant drawing comparisons, yes.  /r/coronavirus turn /r/politics level discourse?

Animal coronaviruses frequently evolve immune evasion - example bovine coronavirus vaccination yearly. Wow, wonder would voted chose wear shoes school.

I think city council ones bullied. holy shit.

Anyone watching Fauci's press conference? He's reporting really good news anti-virals prophylaxis. Regeneron far 100% prevents symptomatic infection one study. vaccine new people may think is--the research done years ago MERS SARS, current vaccine makers used research baseline. Yes yes ridiculous. live county zero cases would need vaccine? Currently 45 active cases entire county (down thousands) still dropping. planning getting vaccine simply won’t necessary time it’s turn. I'm pretty sure one would blame private companies government action, companies would still get paid. would two weeks earlier too, EU banned exports they'd able catch US month two. suspect I'll get downvoted this, I'm fairly confident places fewer restrictions paranoia - like Florida - fare far better terms mental health. People Miami seem happy. Crazy, Boston basically 100% compliance since April. homeless police wear masks. I'm England, I'm Australia, know place whose vaccines EU stole. true, [millions country alone refusing AZ, like six countries banned thing based blood clot deaths even EMA says attributable vaccine. There's evidence less protective vaccine, that's lies leaders telling distract fact fucked procuring it. 500,000 dead America threatening? That's dead wars combined, basically. get damn shot arm that's tested hundreds millions proven safe? I’m believer lockdowns all, check history. trying predict means US. government could’ve eased lot vaccine skepticism advertising vaccines picked years work already done. Highlight big accomplishment is! Don’t tell us, show us. We’re seeing there’s void information leaders, creates harm people fill gaps themselves. So, INSTANTLY downvote I'm saying something like. Please read hit downvote button. 

But information connection informed people. People saying rates people vaccine get blood clot higher, mean anything connected individual case. 

Yes rates same, however someone gets vaccine dies blood clot 4 days later must established vaccine bring admittedly suspcious. Might died later on? Perhaps, vaccine cause blood clot manifest activate faster would otherwise? 

To help understand analogy, got hit car died hospital later blood cot, overall rate people die bloodclot probably affected much... without dispute died HIT CAR. bloodclot effect it.

HEAVY DISCLAIMER: I'm saying vaccine caused bloodclot I'm anti vaxxer, I'm fully vaccinated. I'm saying order fully inform public need information going ""the rates people die via method exact same"" enough. That’s interpreted info packet given vaccine*. 

Initial trials said 85% effective preventing severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. 66% effective preventing symptom positive test finding. tells basically still infected it’s matter symptoms milder. Logic follows theoretically also carry spread virus. don’t think studied. 

*Janssen Vaccine answer question, covid vaccine deadly covid age group? luckily last statement, Mrna vaccines fully approved next month. difference something like abortion IS, fact, personal choice contained one's body. Ignoring something like vaccine going world potential affect you, many, many others could even kill someone. That's difference everyone seems missing arguments. I'm personal freedom, we're together actions affect everyone else. interesting given start pandemic brouhaha rank-and-file nurses pushed way spotlight ~~15 minutes~~ months fame, TikToking social media Rosie Riveter-esque posing jazz now, apparently, jeopardizing patients themselves. 

Hmm. started February! Two shots butt, haven’t grown tail third nipple yet keep everyone posted. There’s “city” South Dakota? Yes, keep increasing threshold Someone skiing. didn’t wear mask started spitting direction gave ugly face. cdc guidelines also say unvaccinated people family gather vaccinated people nobody group needs wear masks distance. Nah. many people understand mask needed. many times heard people say feel sick, wear mask. excuse flies face everything we've told. Seatbelts protect you, mask protects others. got seatbelt laws cause people dumb. motorcycle helmet laws. Unfortunately 50 year old adults act like spoiled children. 😂 No, global pandemic led mental health crisis. would mental health crisis regardless government people react going around world. case economic hardship, people pretend government caused economic hardship implementing restrictions, people refuse go anyways even restrictions. Anecdotally restrictions around many restaurants small businesses struggling people go pandemic...

That line thought saying guys loading life boats Titanic hand causing deaths. People going drown either way, can't sit pretend boat sinking. Here's one article. I've mostly seen claims like mentioned. People medical field also understand vaccine actually prevent covid, spread it, gives decent chance reducing severity effect. vaccinated getting immune system boost people actually thing word vaccine means IE immune. still need wear masks etc. Additionally people medical feild know rushed treatments many want see long term health effect data taking it, especially portion population low risk covid. People think everyone ""anti-vax"" want wait see becoming test subject. think reasonable, speaking people concerns actually listening them.

There really two options here, either six month mandated FDA follow stupid formality that’s good reason, it’s valid reason.

So it?

If it’s stupid formality, FDA dragging feet approval could reliably given today?

And it’s *not* formality, requires admitting 6 month follow necessary determine safety, requires admitting people wanting wait full approval waiting valid reason. might right. I've using Pfizer's calculation example, 170 infection total, 8 vaccines 162 placeboes, resulting 95% efficacy. arrived number dividing placebo total, 162/170 = 95% think right, calc wrong J&amp;J vaccines need bottled US never return due export embargo. Another vaccine write off. cdc guidelines say unvaccinated people family also gather vaccinated people masks distancing. Since vaccines took pharma headlines late 2020, really hard find good info anti-viral supply US. know manufacturing agreements since Summer 2020 ramp production clearcut numbers. Sure think there's really moral, ethical way pull off. vaccine passport seems little dystopian way easy cheat fake. Maybe things like movie theaters they're optional. places go like work grocery store seem right. like precedent set taking away someone's livelihood allow others force make medical decision.

For I'm satisfied vaccination plan still relatively safe regardless others do. time staying home pointless.

If worried getting it, welcome continue isolating. restrictions harsh effects society, getting sick. 20 year old grandma right work specific employer. isn’t discrimination blanket rule bone fide purpose. 

This like saying satanic temple hire evangelical preacher would religious discrimination. doesn’t make sense stop this? It'll approved like month. Literally. There's hundreds millions doses given they've done clinical trials. safe approved. week later, you’ll miss able stay home. 

Grass always greener... antivaxxers spreading disease office gross? objectively true?

Or want antivaxxers putting elderly risk, also objectively true? got healthcare field got covid immediately (from conctact fam member didn’t know yet) wasn’t wanting get am.

It’s sad true know. It’s til something affected personally til wanted vaccine. wanted wait wasn’t Holy smokes dude. Yes, strip cloth fine Walmart. CANT FRICKEN BREATH RIGHT WET CLOTH EXERTING. respiratory issues overbearing. Yes, impractical context. transmission dangerous, shutting schools altogether strip cloth nothing.

Again, I'm staunchly pro-mask fully support government mandating wearing masks public. Quit strawmanning me. I'm specifically complaining circumstance masks completely ineffective, make task impractical. can't make argument clothes.

If okay breathing wet cloth, good you. can't that. Otherwise, name one good reason fully vaccinated individual need mask activity work anyways. kills healthy 4 year olds too. Except hasn’t? 1,000 people died Covid yesterday. Everyone know still social distancing wearing masks. That’s would call “over Americans.” one thing I'd add there's whole lot geological activity going near Keflavik, effectively international Airport country. Earthquakes likely volcanic eruption way, probably pose threat life air travel, depending lava flows could cause notable travel delays, earthquakes rarely fun experience people. You’re idiot. may really unpopular opinion, say due respect profession lot amazing nurses nurses typically highly educated. 2 year program require 4 year degree. Good news team, fully reopening office next week...

I’m antivaxxer now!

What? used make fun people. 

Nope. I’ve always like this. vaccine me. tragic. Completely agree. maybe know idea effects adjuvants since vaccine testing includes placebo adjuvants (wtf?) That's right, threaten day off! Oh shit, realzies? fairness... masks mandated. expected common decency. Trump said wear mask back early April CDC recommended it, actually worn one podium, we'd probably looking less 100k deaths US. think would less mental health crisis people died.

That's needed know. Thanks input. sold car doctor couple Texas last year. wanted vehicle delivered isn’t unusual. went inside sign titling paperwork took masks got inside. said didn’t need wear mask uncomfortable. didn’t believe virus. 

The thing could think doctors weren’t even taking precautions. kept mask rest meeting. Te collective good good thing, many Americans seem like consider it. people getting vaccinated deciding can’t export US export ban. can’t export U.K. U.K. priority vaccines made per contract. can’t export India EU EU hasn’t approved Indian plants. U.K. get 10m AZ doses India soon they’ve done homework signed imports Serum Institute, world’s biggest vaccine manufacturer.

Why hasn’t EU approved Indian plant yet - world’s important supplier vaccines!? need pull finger out. talk emergency, EU seems pretty slow respond. VDL said coordinating EU response like turning oil tanker, sure feels like it.

I recall seeing graph showed U.K. spent slightly vaccine development planning every EU country combined. EU tried cheap vaccines saying goes - pay peanuts, expect get monkeys.

The EU wonderful institution overall, it’s never known nimble. Whoever thought putting charge emergency, like Covid, needs sued high heaven. Giving teachers priority huge slap face essential workers actually working person whole time Sure, take it, get come office, get planes, etc. Personal freedoms personal choice affects well-being others choice matter. wearing mask, getting vaccine, willingly risking peoples' lives them. think that's right? shouldn't. We're unprecedented situation global pandemic 500,000 dead America alone we're precipice ending. time come together what's right whole, self. time like this, things I'd regularly fight for, like said personal freedoms, apply. time make choices what's best everyone, individual. will. California barely starting allow high school sports outdoors despite evidence continue blocking it. That’s California does.  won’t be. dad's got appointment first shot next week. I'm still eligible, least feel better knowing catch work worry passing him. Lmao tough flexing internet. strong special guy are. impressive. 

Just strong enough take little shot...I guess. Nah, majority Texas vaccinated License revoked certifications degrees nullified voided. see comment one hesitating works 15/16 planning we're seeing maybe Trump limited public appearances reason. know breakdown, probably talking Registered Nurses (RNs) vs Nurse Practitioners (NPs) latter higher requirements significantly rare. miss office much! sounds weird, like socialization separation work home. - FDA approval:

First - Could be* approved. company would come say ""hey 33% sure get approved"" nobody.

I trade stocks free time - one thing I've learned last 5 years betting FDA approvals works maybe 1/10 times. makes different? declared safe go scrutiny everything else FDA approves/disapproves. (And - illegitimate unsafe still)

So basically saying (about FDA approval) ""i point could right month""

Also said would willing look taking proper FDA approval - would undoubtedly.

- decision vaccine dangerous virus comes from:

Using logic I've heard last year covid - enough research yet treat extremely dangerous - stance taking drug. would take rushed unnaproved synthetic drug combat something less chance killing driving work? I'm using statistics available make best decision myself. What's wrong that? phrase problem scared unvaxxed person received 95% effective vaccine prevents death &amp; hospitlization close 100% - people rightly ridicule ridiculous. principle matter. collective action problem people need part enough people choose like guy, problem persist society wide level. trump going secretly sworn president 3/20, right? Live Alaska. story. native hospitals vaccinating white man difference something like abortion IS, fact, personal choice contained one's body. Ignoring something like vaccine going world potential affect you, many, many others could even kill someone.

I’m going totally set aside common counter-argument there’s obvious second body involved, everyone agrees it’s unlikely anyone disagrees would consider valid argument.

Even without piece, I’m sure you’re saying really true. Couldn’t one argue terminating pregnancy, affecting *lot* people’s lives? Perhaps, even unimaginably large number people’s lives?  questioned doctrine in, gave answer.

Genocide, apparently. basically negative feedback loop. *rolls sleeve* hit best shot... third time. Look you’ve said befor lol don’t right work there. leave—that choice. 

And vaccine makes less effective job. work nursing home vaccinated means could literally kill people job. 

I really don’t get people want least restrictions employers respect labor rights want restrictions employers comes vaccines. college big nursing school, comes surprise lot nurses exactly deep thinkers. 

It's good-paying profession requires really good couple tasks. tasks might reasonably complicated, general master good go. anything new gets drilled painfully grade-school level training. confused purpose point... see anything article hinting people suggesting ""right now"" thing. 

Of course something place vaccination voluntary choice. supply quenches demand make sense.  Well, quote real. Colorado yeah, realize I'm mostly paranoid. need sample size least 47/50 get 94% back clean using rounding 15/16 lowest population could 16 50 Huh? immunicompromised compromise efficacy vaccine? reply going resonate me. Thank much. think lot anxiety comes everyone else whos itching go go concerts make life worth again. Ive learned pennypinch overwhelmingness guilt spend normally family through. Im scared move beyond college campus unmasked. Im scared future virus lies. Im scared. literally debilitated wanting go out. want go bad normal maskless work healthcare supply chain side. Sell 250 physician offices spend day talking doctors nurses. 250 offices, 7 getting shot. staffs happy protocols MDs like long term data injecting things body. also like told government media. 

I see sides it’s comical see everyone pontificate people enormous amount first responders doctors aren’t getting it. Wow, definitely sound crazy-pants (great saying, BTW)! wish knew minds work produce dreams absolutely insane. Lol

The worst part would “being *not* there. 

Here’s wishing cakes awaiting future...well, except really tasty, frosting-heavy ones. cupcakes. Regeneron something widely available public? thought pretty expensive. Hopefully becomes affordable. Also nSC even trying get appointment shit show. McDisaster gives f**ks Lol police don’t bought much hydroxychloroquine toilet paper! Look I’m sorry annoying people. I’ll take break sub. First whole point argument 1. 100 mil doses 100 days dumb goal easily achievable? first link shows time goal announced wasn’t.

‘The goal seemed ambitious Biden first announced “100 million shots first 100 day” goal Dec. 8 speech Wilmington, Delaware, president-elect. point, vaccinations hadn’t even begun yet.

A New York Times story day called “ambitious” goal said “fulfilling require hiccups manufacturing distributing vaccine willingness Americans vaccinated.” reporters said experts spoke found Biden’s timeline “achievable” “optimistic.”’

The second point majority states open anyway (in regards thread) can’t find evidence show (in second link) currently that. Yeah it’s hard tell text worries. rhetorical question lol. truly sad, along screaming personal freedoms. Personal freedoms longer personal said choice affects community. Everyone needs grow fuck up. source this. I’ve seen claimed evidence it’s case. don’t understand argument they’ll approved next month without question, seems imply 6 month safety follow period formality.


Giving tons doesn’t help reporting rare adverse events isn’t consistent, phase 3 trials persistent follow-ups. I’m guessing may stringent dress codes girls maybe still are.  Thats worries me. eligible pretty early on, still wait week appointment, appointment took well hour because, even coming time, lines massive. options available date, mass rollout seems like saying ""we extend waitlist months"". 6000 shot day center great all, city population million. Let's real, increase vaccine uptake. using arguments like bollocks reasoning simply want want trust science, likely skirting restrictions since beginning. I'm saying that's you, I'm really not, know presume to, let's real, argument holds much weight still saying wear mask even CDC said beginning. Unconstitutional, unenforceable, easy lie taking lol I'd say reschedule donation. can't back said I'm gonna take ball go home

Yea, that. Oh wow, seriously thanks clearing man Common sense intelligence rarely go hand hand Well, vaccine doses already paid full, refuse cannot make claim vaccines long term data. risk assessment thing evaluate yourself. hard make balance without (or little) long term data. making claims sit well me; think important always think critically.

""Again, cannot make claim infection SARS-CoV-2 long term data. risk assessment thing make balance without long term data. making claims (that infection big deal) sit well me; think important always think critically. ""

The stories people gotten jab pretty inspiring, talk experiences, talk real doctor it. 

I'm glad recovered, got sense smell back. Idk you’re asking they. Legally many states allowed things many states would still illegal. asking us company allowed this. Imo companies allowed person without mask mandates couple months. also think companies allowed require vaccination return person see fit. generally favor employees rights one case employee actively refusing vaccinated puts employees health risk. I'm reading cases folks accidentally injected empty syringe.

I give dog injections daily. would REALLY hard fail notice draw liquid syringe pulling back plunger, considering looking measure anyway. empty injections would overwhelmingly rare, whereas side effects super common.  Keep mind vast majority medical care work requires minimal education, much tradeschool. Even nursing starts minimal 2 years community College. lot ""soft skill"" training rhetoric, critical thinking, logic. 

Couple relative easy entry entry-level field decent-to-good pay many positions, recipe many folks interest education, medical technology, social responsibility secure higher standard living pay.

I grew impoverished small town, aside clearly gifted kids growing up, ignorant plain disengaged humans still dirt poor ones became LVNs, RNs, specialized MAs, Medical Technicians. still ignorant and/or disengaged ever were, wealthier new cars, shiny gadgets, small town beliefs ridiculously conservative biases. ""I degree homeopathic medicine!""

""You degree bologna"" also, even ominously imo, basically said ever let citizens travel freely internationally again. severe case last June I’m 100% still strong antibodies like cautious he's being. refreshing change pace last years disaster caused reckless president. Maybe could little vocal reiterating CDC guidelines, I'm also cool patient he's certain seen getting adults vaccinated actually get us safe spot even kids can't vaccinated. really believe transitioning lot white-collar jobs working home necessary part changing economy habits combat climate change. We've already proven mass scale little repercussions, legislators scientists need use example push change now.

For instance, would make transition electric vehicles much easier. people using cars sparingly makes much easier transition car leave plugged week, take handful times need it. 20k day population 1.5 million province? Thats 50 days vacinate adults first dose

So exactly need be.. means MB could vacinated first dose may..

As poorly funded part.. not. elective surgeries. comparison, US hospitals pump billing insurance companies fully funded workers employers. incentive save money making billions.

I really understand US resistant single payer, government run health care. would save trillions, money would go directly care citizens. Us first world country universal healthcare, Unless 65 get free healthcare. Alaska Yea... politics aside vaccine distribution gonna happen even Kanye got elected. took office right taking off. nazi’s support stuff like this. freedom take priority community’s wellbeing

Your rights end mine begin. Sorry, advocating collectivism. ends justify means get Hitler/Stalin/Mao.  THANK YOU! I've trying say throughout thread, keep getting downvoted! think theme parks masks mandatory time? That’s awesome. source that? I’m trouble finding article. cannot impose whatever terms like employees, person responded suggested. sounds like want cake eat to. want private companies act private entities enforcement arm government, whichever one conveniently gets outcome want time. principles this, power.

Make mistake. think business legally allowed make employment contracts whomever want whatever terms parties willing accept, long involve taking third party. also allowed dictate terms upon serve public. Freedom association also implies freedom disassociation. However, world live in, would certainly say making employees get dangerous medical procedure want far oppressive paying less want myriad restrictions them. virus survival rate 99.5%? Maybe blood clots happen presence chemicals blood maybe? far tell Halix plant provided fill finish services vaccine brewed U.K. - basically bottled it. mid February, EU still hadn’t approved plant vaccine manufacture. bottleneck EU’s AZ vaccine brewing, fill U.K., don’t wear mask outdoors, nobody does. Doesn’t stop police enforcing law isn’t there. mother law. works home health aide mentally handicapped adults. refusing vaccine wayyy overweight probably laundry list things wrong her. says want get saw Facebook side effects. like i'm prone side effects get getting vaccine. told get tf house said that.  Well, Mrs. Lincoln, show?

Large events missing. hang friends now. visit family now. Normal large events occurring - constant pessimism frustrating. cousin works little rural Midwest hospital. 2/3 nursing staff refusing vaccine. 

It boggles mind one watch covid patients drown lungs still think big deal. Wouldn’t fucking hilarious “don’t infringe rights” crowd lost privileges demanded ability harm everyone else? people annoying, they'll say shit like ""don't believe everything hear CNN!"" things backed every facet modern medical science turn around get vaccine info joebidenisalizard.com Right?

Finally someone standing Russian propaganda trolls. stupid believe, Sputnik V could good. obviously out-dated technology!!

Oxford-AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna hand brand new therefore best. stupid people always afraid new experiments. That's stupid, not?  goes scrutiny everything else I'm good bro shut fuck up. literally negative getting vaccine. it’s way better everyone get precaution simpletons like making people think don’t need it’s “bullshit”. Read room dude you’re ignorant fuck. start new job I'd agree. Learning home training another new employee remotely challenging. vaccine approved “real” reason someone hesitant? legally still experimental Anyone remember Y2K? least defined date hysteria revealed was. glossed ""or fire them"" part, we? might point 17 people US died yesterday, concert halls open, schools univerisites back in-person graduation ceremonies, 90% people wearing masks. That’s case central Illinois, Chicago, DC, New York San Francisco. places, it’s like 80% wearing masks, aren’t packed concert venues, students schools wear masks, universities still won’t holding in-person graduation ceremonies. dunno you’re living America even close acting like pandemic over. evidence needs, still labeled experimental?

Are five types nurses, education requirements vary list 6 months 6 years. RN, people think hear ""nurse"" 4 year educated nurse. dont get test put reeducation camp? 

Why feeling corporate controlled concentration camps going really badly run. Yeah, I’m saying you’re right, also 95% Oh, appropriate forum make off-topic comments throwaway attempt brag going Dubai? I, too, shall comment went every time country brought up, totally relevant annoying, tell others ones posting topic. course valid reason, I'm debating that.

Ok, people waiting valid reason COVID vaccine development, trials, rollout also unprecedented speed scale. vaccines take years due lack funding government support

All true, happens *before* approval. None changes required 6 months safety. yeah, vaccine developed super quickly, volunteers easy come by, money poured trials..... yet, money buy 6 months haven’t passed.

Remember comment one would change mind full approval, head, anyone who’s hesitant looking excuse. you’ve admitted there’s valid reason wait, meaning must admit exist rational people would take vaccine approval would take approval. That's good, still hurry get vaccine especially AZ news. wait see data comes out. 

My country seems third wave right might third lockdown soon.

Then again, went restaurant/a bar times, fortunately nothing happened. Thankfully never stopped going parks wife. 

Really cant wait social life go back like 2020 able safely hang bars, restaurants, going team's games instead watching TV, international travel etc. Work daycare. amount paperwork keeping flu vaccines tracking people likely require whole new employee per district, maybe even per school. (And know people like taxes raised sports team getting cut)

Regular vaccines typically big deal vaccines preschool, middle/high school student likely record elementary school. Many districts flu shots extra paperwork. COVID vaccine ends like flu needs re-upped every year new variants, gonna LOT work make sure kids date. Easter think.. heat. here, worked remotely 2 years tired it. Joined fun company great coworkers nice office downtown Austin pandemic hit 6 months later. I’m ready go back office. set hours, don’t worry traffic. miss place work leave part. That's awesome! Thanks info Last Easter worked quite well, summer contagion control, result strict lockdown previous weeks.

Last Christmas lot less strict things going accordingly bad, people generally caring little cautious.  shit, sister refusing get (she's labor delivery nurse) afraid effect ability future healthy kids. evidence support that, refuses wear masks anywhere feels to. brother cop also refusing ""until there's research"". research what? ""even long ago 2008-2010.""

I'm sorry made laugh feel old time :) got shot yet, now's time jump line way think of!

No need volunteer second class citizen help it! Awesome, congrats dad! vaccinated soon :)  remember similar headlines May-June restaurants starting reopen. ""Restaurants reopening...will customers come back"". seen Chicago area, answer absolute yes...both indoors outdoors. people go near restaurant even carryout, yes....but exception. staff patrons vaccinated, reason go back true college football also. sad shows democrats earned suffer higher standard expectations republicans.  

500,000 dead, science denial, anti-mask muh-freedum idiots really big surprises republicans helm. think that. normalized get vaccine? it’s 95% effective really shouldn’t bother someone get all, masking distancing vaccination pretty much covid proof. everyone get vax smells like bullshit Serious question - vaccinated, what’s harm allowing unvaccinated people exist amongst general population?

Some don’t get vaccinated religious reasons, health, etc - doesn’t seem fair restrict people events/gatherings/etc choose get vaccination.

Genuinely curious looking answers! Even get vaccine, stay home, Please? wanna drive office. really... makes easier classify people broad brush like rather engage them, means you.  You’re correct one thing Constitution doesn’t give fuck, pandemic basically over. getting lit Well surged last fall, literally nothing changed since then.

- CNN Editor, probably.  think lot offices might turn shared office spaces. half staff comes Monday, first half Wednesday, Thursday, half Tuesday, second half Wednesday, Friday. Management might 4 days week. 

Or Wednesday could everyone day/group meetings. 

But better bet companies see $$$ savings renting smaller office spaces. It’s honestly win win everyone. We're never going reach herd immunity misinformation hesitancy keeps spreading real reason. still dealing hypotheticals versus real situation we're right now. real secret 6-hour workdays, 3-4 days week.  hypothetical B vaccinated, still give grandma still dies?

The unvaccinated putting risk since vaccine doesnt stop spread, according hypothetical. spent much time educating practicing propagandistic mental gymnastics gaslighting...

look reddit see coming woodwork try convince people covid response bill, vaccines, impending re-opening, rising stock market, etc etc bad things.

everything looking since got rid republican control federal level. they'd rather country fail succeed democrat power. Got it. So, jail time it’s approved? taxes taken shit. It’s paid TAXES. Tax people made 11 figure profits covid. one small ways parents getting second dose tomorrow finally seeing friends two weeks almost year hermit. right!? i’ve met straight stupid people working healthcare. think underestimating much people worship Trump. said it, they'd it. forget people committed treason asked to. course valid reason, I'm debating that. COVID vaccine development, trials, rollout also unprecedented speed scale. vaccines take years due lack funding government support. vaccines need rolled quickly hundreds millions people. We're getting data back months new medicine would take years. agree valid, consider variables. Great example would Spanish Flu.

Look pre post mutation effects. 1 month you’ll drop excuse it’s approved? you’ll get shot? correct deaths per million.  horrible Private Care Homes MB, Ont QUE. denying thats majority cases come from.  Vietnam asian countries learned sars early 2000 could happen. deserve aculates.  canada western countries, appitite force quarentines arriverals.  have. 

Canada small anti mask rallies around country, even locally city 800k. One difference small incomparison population CEO/empolyees fired attending.  think rally less 100 people. Looking US president political party opening anti mask - anti science- anti reality.. fucking crazy people here, none government postitions power within country. Party members kicked racist, sexist anti science ideology.. 

But fact remains, first months pandemic 90% positive cases came US travellers (canadians travelling us americans travelling here).. US run covid even though testing it.  

I think i'm smug.. US disaster alot government power. really care Democrats Republicans, past 4 year republicans gone far right point opening lying pandemic. still happening removal mask mandates restrictions places like Texas. 

Anyhow.. countries could faired far better. Canada dropped ball privatizing moving vaccine production canada. appears longer damaging looked like months ago hopefully learning experience.  

All best. ""if good little boy get shots, able BBQ 4th July"" Gee thanks mister! huge push vast majority RNs hospitals (at least US) BSN (4 yr degree).

Source: ER RN BSN I'm sympathetic people frustrated restrictions afraid experiencing government-imposed lockdown-level restrictions July even though actually almost definitely be, like I'm sympathetic people afraid still middle massive deadly pandemic still makes sense locked rooms 2023 even though almost definitely be. They're irrational concerns, strain holding clearly damaging people's mental health, that's sad upsetting me. I'm sure exactly want engage people I'm open suggestions. problem ask “how long little bit?” people give vague answer. 

What sort timeline considering? I'm gonna look twitter, Alex Berenson probably finishing right Anyone saying isn’t going get it’s fully approved. going come different excuse. 

At least full approval military make mandatory thinking thing every time. big relief super happy that. takes 5% one's rational capacity see difference tracked smartphone forced receive injections function society.

The fact somehow trying form argument based tells hopeless convince otherwise. mom nurse works cancer patient ward. They've isolated rest hospital entire time. still insists flu, ""they"" bumping numbers. tried tell numbers could also wrong low end, state already hit pneumonia yearly numbers April last year. broke the, ""I'm medical professional"" line. gave that. Almost every choice potential affect community however get right it. 

In US control body, choose obese unhealthy waste medical resources others need.

In US freedom explore remote areas survival training gear, people get unprepared need rescued, wasting resources.

Name something probably find way link back everyone else. That’s danger thinking like this, it’s easy justify taking away personal choices none. accept spillover community personal autonomy important.

I get vaccine, I’m completely anyone private employers requiring it. Number doses replacement time follow up. reason obvious. it’s actually precautionary measure don’t yet know artificial immune response natural immunity might interact particular vaccine therapy/virus. Nøkternt scenario inkluderer vaksinetypene: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca og J&amp;J. tillegg begrenses AstraZeneca til å være maks 200 000 doser per måned perioden april til september. Optimistisk Scenario inkluderer vaksinetypene: som nøkternt scenario, samt Curevax og Novavax. tillegg begrenses AstraZeneca til å være maks 200 000 doser per måned perioden april – juni

The sober scenario includes vaccine types: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca J&amp;J. addition, AstraZeneca limited maximum 200,000 doses per month period April September.
The optimistic ccenario includes vaccine types sober scenario also Curevax Novavax. addition, AstraZeneca limited maximum 200,000 doses per month period April - June.

Norway's share EU vaccine deliveries 1.2%, 200.000 doses per month delivered Norway equivalent 50 mio doses three months delivered EU. US beaten Europe much since WW2 think *zero* people wait full approval get it?    Yes course, truly zero chance wouldn’t approved, would mean 6 month follow formality.

EUA threshold full approval threshold different, different efficacy safety endpoints. Look don’t believe me. EUA show benefits vaccine outweigh risks. That’s it.

To answer question: worth putting undue pressure opt-outs, undue pressure consequences continuing evolving pandemic? know final opt-out rate be, sooner vaccinate herd, sooner pull e-brake viral mutations. yes, pressure vaccinate entirely justified. much genetics viral vaccine there. someone ELI5 situation please? I'm UK, OX/AZ vaccine used regularly without issue, we're producing here? situation soured EU? Considering we'll open vaccinations then...we really need Well, yes, say too, one unvaccinated family, they're low risk. We're talking party anybody come to.  One year ago today refer ""Black Thursday"". Things getting cancelled left right news changing every hour. beginning day, sports leagues running except NBA. end day, none. government bending backwards provide *additional* resources minority communities....

You think you’re woke making excuses black communities committing exact sins you’re condemning white Americans for. reality, apologetic mindset equally harmful someone “racist”. put racist quotes position also racist, obviously *your* version racist. analogies get dumber every single day job WFH since day last year. 300+ people 1 office CA.

Sure definitely telecommuting remote work going forward, think nearly much would hope make difference commuting better environment. Selfishly unselfishly, hope I'm wrong. there’s nothing stopping employer requiring employee certain vaccinations right sure available country, waiting EU commission approve J&amp;J one shot vaccine. mom medical worker vaccinated Pfizer, sure either. Halloween people stopped caring am. Currently majority care little area I’m California. Cumddlefest* It’s something existed vaccine. vaccine heaviest funded vaccine ever way ahead every aspect go right-clicks control-c/control-v? People soft wanting lives back wasted year. Yes, correct take.  75 million people country delusional, need take conservative steps messaging. mean seriously, people damned sensitive.

You're baby telling people cannot say got defensive someone pointed Dubai actually shit hole. looks like scrambling ""prove"" us actually ignorant seem. Plus would reduce car accidents. many people needlessly drive office end accidents.

The people job *must* in-person also safer roads less busy. muh freedoms (to infect people) That’s totally fair opinion wait full FDA approval. hope it’s enough convince you’ll able get vaccinated protected. understanding recommendation due constrained vaccine supply contraindication. Assuming protection natural antibodies sufficient allows vulnerable people access vaccine.

I assume they’ll drop supply loosens up. Using MRNA help body recognize spike protein attached virus nothing genetics? We’re open bar &amp; expect ~200 guests. We’re fucked, good way haha. Whatever QC problems may seem like must worked judging real world efficacy we're seeing vaccines. almost drove bridge back November I’ve friends straight tell us they’re holding trying baby wedding go balls hahaha. We’re open bar too. try think tab gonna look like... 😂 trying make compliment guy contextualized fact I've (once, briefly). Given millions people visit Dubai every year, hardly bragging mentioning I've Disney. like I'm saying high-tea crumpets royal family.

You clearly chip shoulder severely overreacted simple compliment. You’re inside watching Netflix solo activities outside. locked SuperMax. 

This isn’t forever it’s waiting everyone willing actually get vaccinated 100% opening. 

Your hubris going kill people. people come another excuse approved. people say don’t want mrna. ask Johnson Johnson come another excuse relevant topic way? Sure, that's doctor can't tell anyone it, that's different thing this. Yeah like said review decision gets fully approved. formality. many millions doses given they’d know something bad happened someone write boss giving PTO get it???! Otherwise, wait til end contract days get reset.

But that's pleb problem, seem much sympathy country. I've working in-person daycare, I'm getting little frustrated vaccinated people things, can't can't make appt. unwillingness, fucked employer, illegal country ever want reach herd immunity. would great episode Scrubs. Everyone avoiding vac nurse. Let’s real. truly, honestly think there’s chance approved? emergency use approval, hundreds millions doses, incredible efficacy rate, low adverse outcomes, think there’s chance it’ll like, nope, sorry, approved? Alaska open resident age 16 up. stop think FDA might require 6 months safety follow might be, dunno, necessary establish safety? 

Normally entire world working problem once. scale lot larger since extremely high risk populations getting vaccine en masse. course normally 6 months would required make sure, time still help, like nearly fifth American adults gotten shots, something wrong people would able tell now. really can't compare SOP world global emergency. needed.

Takes ten seconds educate rest comment, I'm hearing lot emotion little evidence rationality. company giving us extra PTO day $50. Let's hope converts people. Still want go back office life though. Supposedly ""go hybrid"" - 2 office, 3 WFH. I'll believe see it. quick result Pfizer least. It’s precisely can’t get vaccinated religious, medical reasons ensure many people possible vaccinated. Curbing people’s rights may seem little excessive alternative letting could get vaccinated didn’t come contact can’t, simply lesser two evils.

Everyone get vaccinated get vaccinated sake ones legitimately can’t. goal post? Next month it’s fully approved? enough scrutiny? get moderna one .... Well good you. Hopefully supply spike materialize like expect too, state get enough doses modify time table. Fingers crossed. Probably 1/3 doctors hospital planning getting vaccine. know place manager said employees considered fully vaccinated gather without mask usage trainings. knowing group anti-vaxers anti-covid employees staff. said attending teaching masks worn. 

It’s partially volunteer organization. Risk/reward isn’t participate.  know. 100 million end June?  That’s impressive.  guess pays first 3 countries sign deals them. Wonder much paid. locales reserving heavily impacted groups moreso others. results unused vaccines.

I mind job, forced stay there's nothing else awful. Shows lack critical thinking someone, want around :p  


/s (or I?) totally makes sense drive extra 1/2 hr get Pfizer vaccine. data Israel unbelievable. Never wildest dreams would imagined 94% effective real word asymptomatic would exaggeration say 99% country. I'm currently Bay Area trust me, completely different world here. mid-level managers gotta manage make sure desk all, droning away like compliant slave are. 

Mid-level manager here. love working home. hire good people, trust good job. talk work lined collaborate video chat. productivity remained almost exactly ever.

I never want go back office again. Please put middle-management. staff want go back in-person ""miss social aspect"" I'm like...you're crazy. “Non native nucleotides”

Nucleotides building blocks DNA RNA- ""raw mRNA"". Every use find term ""raw mRNA"" reference naked mRNA float They’ve tested decade rhey kept toxic.

And obviously learned nothing time?

Are saying Pfizer Moderna stuck component knew could toxic vaccine hoped best? honestly- that's pretty laughable. Setting aside LNP toxicity monitored for- drug demonstrated toxicity made past Stage II trials aware haven’t seen research would love see it. Evidence LNPs they’re using toxic accumulate would greatly appreciated.

The best starting point give would touches various LNPs, similarity existing approved LNPs, cites variety studies safety specific vaccines. close 3M! I’m Moderna mNRA clinical trial. 60,000 others tested vaccine, fools like don’t to. Getting covid definitely safe, you’d rather take chances covid, means...off go. close 3 million!

Right giving empty words say people ignore it. We’re soooo close 3 million! Hopefully reach next days! Boy glad see us pass 100 million mark. completely understand essential worker. wish able get vaccine asap. understand comment anger working service business. people coming feed providing means earn money? Bl-e state deimplementation going take looooooooooooooong time. alma mater, Stanford, rumored talking mask mandates *this fall*. keep asking, widespread vaccination win-condition, is? Well thank God law making then.

Vaccination preference negligence. Plenty front line nurses opt taking vaccine. guess what? great job they're good at. emotional lend argument credence. cancel culture you.

This vaccine rushed literally short long term studies affects body, especially first mRNA vaccine literally manipulate DNA strands spike proteins. know. knows don't.

Feel free put body sake feeling better taking mask off. That's fine. fault anyone getting it. slander medical professionals saving lives years choose preference pretty damn narcissistic ignorant. Almost every government ""lied"" cases deaths. look Ukrainian cases deaths curves adjust population size, almost carbon copy Russia. countries sub notification due incompetence understandable difficulties. Put every non developed country magnifying glass Russia find statistical issues. WOW. honestly trying suggest nobody ever enter leave county? counties zero cases year half ago. see problem argument? Looks like death back menu boys. think misunderstanding point I'm trying make. personally support wearing masks sick we've moved past covid emergency.

The point I'm making somebody says they're never wearing mask hope one else does, they're illustrating personal freedom make choices related health, they're also caught people doing, that's ridiculous. good friends coworkers no... would rather see ever meant got work home permanently. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

The original proposal submit January. wrote ""cases per million"", add word ""severe"". Thanks pointing out. Yeah, fuck people kept things going extreme risk sickness death us.

God fucking pitiful. would love see situation dozen companies one area come together lease single space, gets 2-3 days month. Make REALLY nice space...like tons great amenities, etc. 2-3 days per month. Then, employees come bi-weekly team updates, collaborations, kick-offs, etc. rest time, everyone works home.

You could even reserve like 10% space ""always-shared"" space people could come hotel need to, etc. Something like WeWork, multi/larger companies instead individuals/startups. someone immune compromised, vaccine may may fully effective, feel comfortable going back office everyone vaccinated. part constitution specifically violate? Quote it. tutor elementary kids program uni Y'all need move closer work.

I literally changed jobs avoid commute like this. regrets. study add anything know reinfection. small (n=33), ignored agreed criteria constitutes reinfection, caveats (such negative test infection reinfection) make meaningless. took arm 4 hours hurt, took aspirin, used heating pad👌 Thank you! hope everyone get thru soon Ok yeah I’m saying they’re main problem, I’m saying types people exist levels system Thank Christ I'm seeing ppl say ludicrous is. faith temporarily restores. Holy shit lol even aware housing insanity past months, looked comment just... wow. much owning house ever, guess. literally addressed entire nation last night. Largely unfounded, low data driven studies suggesting this. That’s cool. diseases well. enough reason destroy everyone’s livelihoods. Open up. anatomy, physiology, biology, microbiology, classes ones med students take

You're either lying misunderstood situation. Med students take chemistry biology, pre-reqs. also take grad courses would never mixed undergrad courses, let alone course. Med students take ""physiology"" either. take entire year physiology split different courses organ system.

I doubt nursing education requires effort discipline, implying similar med school disingenuous. Medical school classes made engineering degree feel like walk park. two BSNs class said level rigor med school classes compared BSN like comparing training complete local 5K running marathon Boston Marathon qualifying times. Med school completely all-consuming comparable nursing education, let alone equivalent.  hard criticise people believing conspiracy theories year ago conspiracy theorists saying become second class citizen refused vaccine. That's deaths reflect people got infected past. people got vaccinated week show getting infected weeks now, getting hospitalized week that, dying couple weeks that.  vaccines 100% effective severe disease death ...so nothing see That’s fine, long ready go I’ll happily take often needed long means don’t need mass lockdowns  doubt that. already daily headlines different areas rolling back restrictions they’re really memorable people live there. 

People stop paying attention restrictions effect day day lives gone. might still months left look around say “huh, guess COVID-19 really all”. lot cooler can’t pick/buy groceries now?  niece age. 
I pray universe bless 🙏 Low fatality risk. Lots people get fucked disease lasting cardiopulmonary damage never see hospital. Anyone else feeling frustrated people community still overly anxious outdoor mask wearing? keep hearing stories everyone finally ditching masks social distancing I’m jealous lol. love taking walks weather getting nicer, every time majority people still wear masks (sometimes two) even they’re completely alone even close someone sidewalk. smile little head nod every time, either glare make sort weird scene like, RUN dramatically...One masked lady literally almost ran oncoming traffic avoid walking towards even though sidewalk plenty wide. getting tired seeing judgemental eyes every time go outside. want able smile people again.  vaccine long time

That's thing. COVID distant memory point. rate declining, gone months, even vaccinate another single person. entire subreddit lately gone direction. Downvoting speculation one thing, downvoting facts makes zero sense. highest single # cases since November, sounds like surge me. 

That said, appreciate answer. wasn’t sure they’ve vaccinating definitely weight situation   half US didn’t kind lockdown shit hitting fan October-January. would change?

I’m stating facts hypothesizing likely reasons anti-science beliefs frequently seen among nurses. I’m saying likely lack standardized education across field. nurses BSNs Universities. Others community college associate degrees.

That's increased infectivity works. increased spike protein containing mutations make bind ACE2 easily, meaning need lower viral load get number cells body infected. means viral load would likely infect cells significant enough number.

I'll probably still wear one mass transit doctor's such, expect anyone else to. choice. Oh do? South Dakota never mask mandate 8th highest death rate per capita? making promises opening irreversible

perception irreversible promise. plenty states like stated, yet cases suddenly spiked people lose shit measures reinstituted. Heck, past Winter proved reason disease spread rapidly. Politicians afraid enact strong measures people would gone nuts, even areas measures ignored many. 

Heck, let's say variant comes months even worse original makes vaccines ineffective. 100% guarantee large portion people cry ""You told us over!"" literally mad messenger reality situation.

Of course another part problem people lived real hardship. People literally crying ""I sick this!"" still wear mask despite vaccinated. Literally complaining wear mask little longer. Stating ""if end last forever!"" childish, ignorant statements something minor. 

I sorry, faith people even fraction believe. Nothing turn American faster telling forced something.

Americans forced bunch shit give fuck normalized (like paying taxes needing driver's license operate vehicle). mom moron like dad. Pfft, tracked phone. mean gently corrected stood ground without even looking sure tossing insults need data let’s ignore data kill people. many times gonna ignore Fauci CDC decide stop killing people?

This going process. It’s great it’s begun seniors aren’t dropping like flies. ignore risk remains insane. I'm certain will. I'd surprised Gov DeWine announces April 4th outdone. :) 

If not....ROAD TRIP!!! agree you. went suburban NY (Westchester County) winter visit family, bizarre me. went \*literal wilderness preserve\* walk dog. isolated walked past another person maybe every 5min, almost wearing masks. Made feel like asshole even considering bringing one. Like, get it, abundance caution, like.... man

Here Houston, everyone wears masks grocery stores Walmart, park maybe 25%. Same. also super available. answer emails phone calls promptly. work day starts 8am sharp email employees boss days activities goals. work bad office. Find different job. Easier said done, know. end miserable long-run. Unless literally on-call position (i.e. servers fire, need fixed), nothing important constantly tethering employees phones. That's toxic work culture. Good, I’d love see new trial data. Excited Novavax suggestions? Maybe let rip collect bodies afterwards? like they're going test BMI, filter people bit. Anyone obviously skinny going get shot show up. Thank you. Reddit, sure, let's talk people.

All people logic: support point I'm thinking right now? Yes? Cool wholeheartedly support this. Why? Reuters poll says people think happen? else pushed? took paycut pandemic. Get it.  Yeah wear mask, avoid getting close shoppers, shop hours store's crowded, risk infection grocery run tiny. obviously, wash hands soon get home. week-over-week increase 488,866 doses day. exact increase tomorrow, we'll **3,393,095** doses! True. got Pfizer already I’m biased. Lol Even COVID longer threat, would welcome fewer people office combat regular, old-fashioned cold flu. estimate everyone wants one received least one vaccine? matter everyone else office vaccinated?

Fuck them. Life risks complete hypocrisy say things covid people willing eat obesity. still take hospital beds arent shunned.
People get sick, fact life. That's hospitals. get sick seek appropriate treatment. 
People willingly spreading fucking disease. arent coughing people's faces.
Every person world likely passed flu, common cold etc etc dozens times people.
The obsession covid evil strange hypocritical. agree well whole subreddit swung hard direction. get lot people exhausted things looking lot somewhat feel people optimistic point they're ignoring 1) things still go wrong 2) still lot suffering still ongoing may solved soon wanting solved.

Then sub allowing far many Vitamin questionable preprints. Yes no. Coming another Arizonan, clearly COVID remains threat society nearly ""open"" yet, feel like general populace stopped caring long ago.

Last weekend went large park saw dozens dozens people hanging large groups -- single masks sight. employees running boat kayak services yell people waiting line put mask got booth.

Super frustrating witness, sadly surprising. People burnt social distancing, internal cost-benefit analysis safe vs. moving lives swinging hard direction latter.

This saying stop caring, way. Please continue practice proper safety precautions. understand accept so, large minority. unless something major changes, that's going remain pandemic actually over. ability smile people based response real trouble depends pick sample population 1,000+ people strong sample size.

Mask mandates low correlation infection rates states, theres plenty evidence side issue, hence debate, Dr. Seuss completely different issue largely opinion, test someone's reasoning abilities.

Again, issue presentation, reasoning abilities, like earn trust.

You keep making decisions feel right hopefully leave house better position would packed bags jumped ship unprepared. smart someone know wants berate they're worth second thought. 

Ignore haters you. I'm one person I'm rooting you. Astonishing. think watching people die COVID would make motivated get vaccine avoid it. apparently conspiracy theorists compelling, even nurses. true contract indemnifies AZ respect late deliveries, reasonable, EU can't come say ""we've lost trillion output you, pay it"" something crazy like that. 

They *in* *general* sign away ability sue. However, I'm pretty sure happen, nobody's interest. EU member states want vaccines, want now.

Best way go apply controls pressure degree, time support AZ, possible, anything need European supply chain. require in.

Or fire you. Getting degree means still plagued falsehoods. Look players politics. MGT complete wacko. many doctors also board calling corona virus hoax. Educated doesn’t mean you’re intelligent philosophical. truly cared ""freedumbs"" continue choosing live society? received 10% groceries local grocery store. That's... socialism. Yeah, I’m assuming numbers pretty minuscule.  I’m tired anti-everything community downplaying Covid overhyping vaccine effects. Except it’s number doses- 5 months 6 month period said need. Given ton data showing safe vaccines far, fact vaccines rarely ever manifest side-effects later way drugs do- reason believe full approval isn’t formality point? Pfizer Moderna vaccines reached 6 months follow time rule comes anyway.

It appears confused. rule already exists. FDA requires minimum 6 months median follow assess safety full vaccine approval, 2 months EUA. part aren’t approved Drugs vaccines different beasts. Drugs build system interact drugs weird ways. That’s simply case vaccines.

I quite aware vaccine drug taken every day. intuitive, point obvious, something body exposed short period time still cause long lasting damage takes become apparent. [This 2018 cites areas concern, including, ironically, buildup foreign particles, purport happen “drugs” Potential safety concerns likely evaluated future preclinical clinical studies include local systemic inflammation, biodistribution persistence expressed immunogen, stimulation auto-reactive antibodies potential toxic effects non-native nucleotides delivery system components Preach! can't believe many people fell conspiracies treated people like garbage result. depressing RIGHT DONT ASSHOLE Yes obviously true. choose put body, whether it’s good bad you. saying people forced get vaccine? so, leads believe that? not, point? pray platform isn’t representative population whole.

No platform Since post deleted replying, organizations lied multiple facts throughout 2020

This guilt association ad hominem fallacy. Even accepted conclusion past statements lies, argument address facts forgive look numbers think myself

Nothing wrong - need present facts support course can, numbers side!

You explained dwindling case numbers = pandemic already free allow CDC/WHO think disagree.

Strawman attempt get disregard facts situation look emotional lens.

I included factual argument (the R0 number makes even &lt;1% fatality rate problematic) emotional appeal (people lost loved ones would offended appraisal danger pandemic). omitted factual basis argument.

If arguing down-slope new cases signals pandemic winding down, could entertain argument.

However, asserting pandemic over, requires accept facts evidence. need tell fucking good coffee is, okay? I'm one buys it. know good is. Bonnie goes shopping *buys shit*. buy gourmet expensive stuff drink want taste it. 

But know what's mind right now? *ain't* coffee kitchen.

But plausible many private businesses this. I'm 100% OK thing FDA approved. 

You get get people sick ones selfishness. That's society function. percentage total population need vaccinated order prevent virus mutating rendering vaccines ineffective?

I'm epidemiologist, I'm sure answer specifically (in part virus around long, people study stuff still studying it) depends easily virus spreads, susceptible mutate much mutations impact effectiveness vaccines. 

The general benchmark could constitute herd immunity, disease less likely spread infect either people can't vaccinated/people vaccinated develop immune response still uncertain COVID-19; estimates find vary 70%-90% (including people immunity vaccines infected recovered). number dependent effectiveness vaccine, contagious disease first place. example, herd immunity threshold measles 92-95% measles *incredibly* contagious. ramifications people face believing science? disagree sentiment, think mistaking right-to-work at-will employment, right-to-work laws mean employer can't require member union condition employment, at-will employment means employer terminate employment time.

South Africa halted use AstraZeneca-Oxford coronavirus vaccine Sunday evidence emerged vaccine protect clinical trial volunteers mild moderate illness caused contagious virus variant first seen Oxford Covid vaccine 10% efficacy South African variant, study suggests Yeah, somehow trust AZ perform unbiased scientific research this... researchers found durable immune responses majority people studied. Antibodies spike protein SARS-CoV-2, virus uses get inside cells, found 98% participants one month symptom onset. seen previous studies, number antibodies ranged widely individuals. But, promisingly, levels remained fairly stable time, declining modestly 6 8 months infection.

Virus-specific B cells increased time. People memory B cells six months symptom onset one month afterwards. Although number cells appeared reach plateau months, levels didn’t decline period studied.

Levels cells virus also remained high infection. Six months symptom onset, 92% participants CD4+ cells recognized virus. cells help coordinate immune response. half participants CD8+ cells, kill cells infected virus.

As antibodies, numbers different immune cell types varied substantially individuals. Neither gender differences disease severity could account variability. However, 95% people least 3 5 immune-system components could recognize SARS-CoV-2 8 months infection. lol literally read post 2 seconds saw comment. feel hopeful now! Pfizer, hope extends Moderna J&amp;J. I'm worried kids. understand “traditional” vaccine right? Also, maybe missed one shot two? Companies dress codes office, can't impose dress code working. want share zoom therapy something implementing, quirks, support human connection worth while. ability get telemedicine, fit schedule, hope give shot. Right! end world people enjoy working home.

An employer would probably also want give vaccinated employees option work home make sure people incentived delay vaccination hope getting work home. determine shop person, fair, whether able customer store.

Walmart operates pharmacies would say there's quite lot medical history available is.

I mean, live country private organizations run majority healthcare system. companies corporations many incentives use data, medical info, etc., benefits them, little oversight. Concerns needing show proof vaccination order keep people safe pretty non-intrusive considering Walmart films face enter, purchasing history, offers credit cards membership programs, etc.

Edit: Typing phones sucks seems imply 6 month safety follow period formality.

Given currently know, fact vaccines 5th month follow up- reason think won’t get formal approval next month?

Because based evidence far- formality point. already mountain evidence. That's approved. finish term force people come in, nothing really lost be. Yeah people think can’t already fired literally anything sound like one dumb ass libertarians Outdoor transmission spreads virus massive scale. ""risking it"" oatmeal/applesauce. Seems like brainer ask Obviously yes.... I'd go game right lol think majority employees probably right thing. cares slack meet deadlines. I’ve worked professors/doctors/etc. capacity adult life. really astounding “educated” people also stupidest morons walk face earth. wasn’t hysteria. *huge* amount work done lot engineers. everybody US eventually got virus – likely continue people refuse listen basic science – 0.5% deaths 16 million people US.

This assuming mutations, realistic assumptions. 

And there's evidence mortality rate may high 3% – probably falling somewhere middle. 

That's millions people. cool that?

Folks trot 99.5% 100%. isn't. get credit? Literally thing would happening right matter President. able secure doses long Biden President.  well people severe pre-existing conditions. “non-severe” pre-existing conditions, wait April 12th eligible they’re older 50, they’re younger, wait even longer. know Inslee eventually move dates earlier (probably Biden yells him), don’t know unveiled conservative vaccine plan first place, knows it’ll likely change week two.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* You’re begging question. lot things comparable. You’re saying nobody forced anything, firmly established Weinstein’s case using position influence force consent consent. People preeminent right bodies. get impose means.  Rights enforced emotions. moral viewpoints think enforced. enforce government inaction USA without forcing government creating maintaining own. 


Rights obligations others, free. best get free pleasant circumstances. Same. tell leaving why. Obviously restriction would take place everyone given opportunity get vaccine. would silly think otherwise. countries human rights. place?  Lol people actually believe comment?

I take gen chem, chem, A&amp;P &amp; II, Pharmacology, microbiology prerequisites could even start taking actual nursing classes. Amazing stuff people make up. Last reports saw (Israel?) spreading fully vaccinated non-issue. given N. Italy hit tsunami death last year think want risk it. Also, certain cultures inherently social, walking ""alone"" really mean apart ""accidentally"" bump friend groups parks exact time. screwed many different aspects keeps going on. 30s supposed great years still young healthy(knock wood lol), skilled capable, building careers/businesses, families etc. 

I really hoping end year economy improve like really fast. I’ve yelled saying people don’t believe vaccines shouldn’t allowed medical field all. degrees revoked well licenses. It’s absurd we’re still dealing horseshit folks “smart”. 60% population needs vaccinated effective.

This bullshit.  Also, underlying conditions *such BMI 25 over* start March 22nd. Lots medicines given tons people later discovered subset; cohort severe adverse event took people notice.

Drugs vaccines different beasts. Drugs build system interact drugs weird ways. That’s simply case vaccines.

And Pfizer Moderna vaccines reached 6 months follow time rule comes anyway. buy anything non essential? order go restaurants? cause many essential employees getting sick spreading covid Quick! Someone find senior! (Joking course -- bad idea, caring seniors probably ought fully vaccinated, everyone official care worker) It’s okay 1/3 population doesn’t want it. 60% population needs vaccinated effective. finally found place took name vaccine overflow/leftover list. walgreens krogers tried said needed currently eligible Survive cost? Ever heard long covid? mutations? Science real. That’s lie. mean, would social distancing enforceable allowed walk alone? Like police stops way party could say “I’m walk” free whatever want Yes, part problem.

You absolutely know long term effects COVID be. one does.

You *could* inform science behind vaccine choosing to. want learn, *could* choose listen expert scientists, instead, relying gut instinct worse Facebook posts come conclusion risky.

You making informed decision, choosing remain uninformed using ignorance excuse justify behavior wanted anyway. rights end mine begin. moron want part protect society getting vaccine, putting others risk get privilege around rest us. doesn’t stutter. Never has. dementia say he’s stuttering, big difference. exactly laymen's terms, pulling [this SARS-CoV-2 virus studded proteins uses enter human cells. so-called spike proteins make tempting target potential vaccines Novavax vaccine works teaching immune system make antibodies spike vaccine injected muscles arm. injection includes many spike nanoparticles, along compound extracted soapbark tree. compound attracts immune cells site injection causes respond strongly Immune cells called antigen-presenting cells encounter vaccine nanoparticles take antigen-presenting cell tears apart spike proteins displays fragments surface. so-called helper cell may detect fragments. fragment fits one surface proteins, cell becomes activated. recruit immune cells respond Novavax vaccine also trigger another kind protection destroying infected cells. coronavirus invades, infected cells put fragments spike protein surface. Antigen-presenting cells activate type immune cell called killer cell. recognize coronavirus-infected cells destroy chance produce new viruses. Oh well that’s good since death rate measles also completely dwarfs death rate Covid vaccines!!  tf EU dead-set smearing vaccine? There's nothing stopping firing getting vaccinated without medical cause, though people know 65 around gotten least first shot. medical worksers teachers too, even people non-K12 childcare. MI bit dodgy beginning hospitals handling everything, seems much, much better activated pharmacies like CVS Rite Aid distribute. Seems like people getting places like I've seen. Thats top already expanded numbers 2nd quarter (by 30% iirc), compared cut ones AZ. Lmao wow sure got me. Thanks Reddit moment. Oof, stings. Move job immediately getting fired.

Glad hear boubced back Depends sure. It’s reason I’m glad don’t live areas. I’m outside Detroit. Around masks public anything outdoors it’s rare see mask. Biden said “you may small gatherings July 4!” response around “yeeeeah how’s different last year???” whole family it. 48 hours mild cold, tested positive afterwards. 

Tbh, much smaller reaction two friends vaccine - apparently similar timespans protection, lol. 

I've told - oh might breathe right now, might feel tired etc - think lot effects result anxiety people feeling, knowing name put it.

I feel great, whole family feels great. rad tech. AS, much education rad tech BS. much education training RNs. still idiots field, still idiots RNs. remeber RNs barely pass last attempt boards RTs ace boards frist time. Stick me. true all. viral load would larger unvaccinated person presenting symptoms. Even then, OP proposing vaccinated person would infecting immunocompromised person. can't believe much emotional energy wasted commuting. concept American dream

How come? probably closer think. start allowing sporting events full capacity (ignoring idiots Texas already are), imagine airlines would far behind. mentioned specifically almost certainly last ease mask policies. Maybe try smart artist next time. 

*A smartist.* Thank going say too. unpopular important distinction. mom likes reference friend x-ray tech medical reference. Still nowhere near doctor, ma. People get though think important kind thing said. There’s LOT things mandated lately would thought self-evidently “silly”  think nearly much would hope make difference commuting better environment

I agree well. That's I'm advocating need vocally aggressive it, even actors who'd I'd think could make big difference issue (AOC, Bernie, etc) vocal it. doctrine vs doctorate in. Doctrine set beliefs, ie difference protestant catholic even further, Presbyterian vs Baptist. legit go hospital last 20 years.

Pretty much anything would make go hospital immediatly ""big deal"" category.

Tbh neighbor either endoctrinated stupid shit post again.  I'm disagreeing, pointing runs contrary founding principles USA. long-held standard force people get medical treatments want to, includes vaccines prevent highly contagious deadly infectious diseases (smallpox, measles, etc............................) impact person getting vaccinated might potentially infect result getting vaccinated.  promise you, idiots. I've talk one sending money address company promised make extra new movie, one still thinks climate change real, liberals problem comes issues police. feel bad remarking it’s horrible Germans deal course American remember people parroting nonstop great German response everything back normal, etc. US couple countries like Sweden Brazil done bad job people assumed countries virus figured seems far reality Wishing best - really mean Financial liability realistic one. We're far it, there's point future FDA approved, readily available, etc… and one still refuses, able sued kill somebody. like situation accidentally harm somebody. 

And course, there's personal ramifications long-term Covid symptoms death some. nurses highly educated. Yeah, this. Everyone assumes vaccines safe, dont truly know. sceptical something even remotely believing disproven claims.  

Personally take vaccine turn, simply opinion general benefit outweighs personal risk. exactly unhappy group receive later. guarantee end wrong, although wish correct. made clear forced receive injections one way another, either mandation exclusion essential services. scary Covid Gonorrhea essentially immune treatments it. Actually, Italy use “regional” system (Italy little smaller California 20 regions let math understand division), three types restrictions, called colours, addition national curfew 10 pm. 

White zone: Sardinia far, restrictions whatsoever, except public events national curfew 
Yellow zone: public gatherings, bars restaurants open 18 pm 
Orange zone: free movement within towns cities, bars restaurants closed 
Red zone: lockdown, described above

I really see alternative lockdowns cases rapidly rising actually miss much, I’m point hate working home. Yup, wife DNP. don’t trust nurses. stories nurses hospital terrifying. Whenever head “a nurse told me, XYZ” can’t take serious anymore. I’ve nurse tell magic water cure cancer flu vaccine mind control drugs. know lots good nurses, there’s even bad ones seems. 

At hospital providers vaccinated. 60% nurses. offered everyone multiple times. nurses clinic noses totally masks. true vaccines came (who knows got vaccinated anyway) answer vaccinate isolate immunocompromised parent. scenario still kills parent Person &amp; B vaccinated. Person B still gets virus passes person regardless vaccination status. Im 30 feel you. difference opportunity look mirror see stupid were. big part growing up. Im sure lots people age look back late teens early 20's cringe. still wouldnt take moments back. ok screening new employees based medical history? company requires proof arthritis? AIDS?  That's tests. figure solve problem sit back relax. Remember GOP mad sell cakes gay people? Well businesses choose restrictions customers employees. eating sugar doesn’t guarantee you’ll coke human demand certainty seems drown actual answers.

Most sub nutshell. People want told exactly things end, idiotic expectation. Yet instead accepting lunacy expecting perfect predictions call lies. sense lied dismiss everything accept want hear. think scientists problem real problem ignorance. serious? Yes ofcourse. allowed full stadiums 3 months ago would packed lmao. research effects vaccine? skeptical everything innate instinct fact vaccines rushed could always potential side effects. Look news regarding Astra Zeneca vaccine potential blood clots.

We need stop vilifying everyone skeptical. Yes, idiots think government microchipping people vaccines. people free make choice, forced ultimately vaccine available anyone wants it, refuse get sick. Personally, I'll take risks potential vaccine side effects clearly serious unresearched long term negative health effects covid. acting like reason skeptical medication vaccine dumb.  hybrid sounds pretty ideal. I've began get sick WFH. Obviously perks, there's something real social interaction separating work home. cz huge surge due UK strain. understandable, others maneuver around person, often going street. I've several times avoid walking behind unmasked ppl blocks end. Doctors nurses taught regurgitate. They’re scientists scientifically-inclined professionals. like saying corn farmer plant scientist Except we’ve required vaccines years schools travel business. would think ""it's big deal lets open everything immediately"" crowd care minor side effects hundred thousand deaths caused vaccine, let us open everything immediately. Thank you. better many understand frustration someone says, ""It 99% recovery rate.""

Yeah? Fuck around find out. Dying worst thing happen someone gets covid. Living 30, 40 years disability fun. office downsizing 25k sqft 5k sqft. basically going hub training, customer meetings, small groups. permanent offices desk, flex spaces desk someone use day. would require changing law

Wrong. FDA full discretion fully approve. 6 months median minimum follow law, process decided appropriate. could change tomorrow wanted, there’s need change Moreover- vaccines drugs. don’t build system weird interactions drugs line. 

The amount times I’ve heard today might make commit seppuku. I’ve already linked paper elsewhere discusses long term concerns. Lipid nanoparticles extremely toxic don’t retain negative charge serum, took long time get “right”. There’s concerns raw mRNA floating around, persistence expressed immunogen. 

From 2020, mRNA biotech companies poor results testing mRNA drugs cardiovascular, metabolic renal diseases; selected targets cancer; rare diseases like Crigler–Najjar syndrome, finding side-effects mRNA insertion serious

Yeah, fuckin sounds like something might want wait panel scientists FDA decided right follow period, pass. Yeah. Right it’s still millennials’ favor, 2-3 years it’ll even Gen Z scares many states many 60% doctors refusing get vaccinated. 

My family able get vaccinated early many doctors refused vaccine handed randos. Given rate everything going multiple effective vaccines available general public several months (with STILL coming), Labor Day weekend 2021, seeing 100% full-capacity allowed every CFB stadium across country, means something gone catastrophically wrong. made realize - stats showing number car accidents going US past year? would interesting see. know feel like must have? guess can't speak location-specific restrictions... speaking kind national/federal mandate. evidence pointing fact vaccines extremely effective people want get vaccinated really reason keep unvaccinated workplace. Theoretically pose risk anyone. Additionally, six months really going still living level seclusion last year? people maybe them. really good argument allow people refuse get vaccinated stay home work ""safety"". people shopping, seeing friends, living normal life exposed plenty unvaccinated folks. several COVID exposures work since vaccine Dec gotten sick once. antibody levels roof. worried around anyone vaccinated. “Think creatively bankrupt mass produced Hollywood cape shit movies you’ll miss on!”

You trying make guy himself? Hyper contagious met one person it. I’ve going packed bars restaurants year now, always tested negative virus antibodies. Yeah problem Fauci effective communication public part job important one that. constantly getting misquoted taken context people claim certain point it’s much media. Weird. got last night around 8 pm can't tell I'm hot cold either. major reaction though bit fatigue body aches. aches even set half hour ago, roughly 16 hours shot. Arm absolutely murdering me, however. surprise quite bit actually. live Arizona, although broke Biden, somewhat conservative state. pandemic definitely here, like all. Masks still required every public location. Every office building I’m aware still closed. There’s still thing sports, concerts, festivals, etc. Bars restaurants still struggling. Dating still largely impossible. way pandemic anyone you’re willfully burying head sand lying yourself. exact thing, rent much higher get you. mention would primarily adversely affect demographics already facing oppression discrimination. false got vaccine mean want put restrictions people. false.  highschool debate, matter much wish were. slippery slope logical debate thing slippery slope right-in-front-of-your-face.

Not knowing means ready college-debate team knock off. think UK export ban Conspiracies aren’t options. Deal it. really hope something changes major scale everyone boat.   Yes, think that. 2 weeks flatten curve even mean that?? wonder long get vaccine wear badge sort, register state. way rounded easier needed. I'm sure good chunk Americans support well. account apparently Wisconsin, at-will state. people love claiming victim hate bare minimum research. Vaccinated people still spread virus they're still danger others well. steady months dropping. Someone lying BBC.  Oh yeah doubt still every year becoming less less. course there's real hard date cut-off things anyhow. Jesus. NJ, legalized medical MJ years ago now. Got medical card, little hologram. 

This year, legalized marijuana fully renewed card recently, it’s already Real ID. 

My drivers license still needs update though... ""I agree poll must wrong! science-illiterate bubble opinions matter!"" not? vaccines work. used live Fairbanks, Alaska. Winters fucking suck. said ""doctrine"" instead ""doctorate"", former meaning ""a belief set beliefs held taught Church, political party, group."" fitting (in eyes) they're referring group doctors teaching personal beliefs Church. Walmart Disagree. They’ve measured. Captain Obvious another dinger here. 9 months late. read BBC News R rate 0.6 0.8. Maybe lying me, it’s still sinking like stone lower it’s ever regardless. variant distinct first discovered Britain, South Africa Brazil, thought pose similar level threat.

Why news wires jumping anyway? Brazilian variant found, Japanese scientists caught Brazilian tourists, sequenced it, said immediately looked dangerous. 

Be nice get information mutations distinct UK, SA, BZ ones (and also E484K?) 

Japan's prediction Brazilian variant would awful came surge, good reason watch one Philippines.

Edit:

Don't feel dumb, they're midst one... Pushing back early send prudent... People going ""don't read much it"" Biden's statement helping anything. rural area well non-vaccine hesitancy threw doors open early 50+ conditions. Every day enter office get anal swab test. Approved adults April. probably looking 2022 early 2023 FDA approval children. vaccines dont stop spread stop disease though, lessens affects, still carrier like unvaccinated. 

It still mutate carried vaccinated person. Ah, see. Thanks comments! want many people possible vaccinated, support kind measure. medical history business employer.

I also hate states made vaccinations compulsory kids attend school. want kids vaccinated, making things mandatory sucks. People vaccinate kids smart thing do.

We need attack disinformation streams people understand vaccines safe effective. Throw education problem. slower tactic, help us long run. 

The best way handle workplace issue, opinion, incentivize getting vaccine, punishing get it. Offer bonuses treats showing vaccination confirmation. come state federal government directly businesses financially feasible. People things properly incentivized. get around Atlantic's paywall time. Trump admin good job procurement doubt.  Biden well distribution motivating people get vaccinated, Trump set well so. *Carbon dating joined chat* Uhhh normally walk Park alone get massive rager?
Why opposed people right walk alone outside? Good lord. Eat cheeseburgers want - affects YOU. people running around acting contagious virus doesn’t matter gets spread others die severely affected it? affects others, you. Ha true. hurts Lions fan glad bring joy rest NFC North. made math and... holy shit. 110 work days.

There's like 260 work days year. That's actually fucking unbelievable.

Used hour half morning get up, get ready, get door, get work. usually another hour half get home.

Now it's... 5 minutes throw sweatpants t-shirt feed dogs zero minutes commute home. Hypothetical question: would feel perfectly healthy 25-year-old essential worker managed get vaccine appointment local municipality today? Assuming aware yet qualify. problem Atlantic NPR. time babbling like 1 paragraph actual information.  Let jealousy fuel appreciation someone WFH :( those?  manufactured consent/propaganda, paid votes, paid comments.  Phlebotomy certificate program, although nurses things more. Phlebotomy simple enough states even started allowing pharmacy technicians it. scientific evidence, choose ignore it. vaccines 10x less effective south african virus typically eradicated it’s exclusive humans, Covid-19 isn’t. We’ve already seen plenty strains within animals.  Lmfao im position explaining. Prove wrong. Yea god forbid anyone scientific community question anything think latter, former. much easier keep people refuse vaccinate boarding planes, filing taxes, renewing health insurance hold every American vaccinate will.

Just like US government outsourced war drugs corporate America (e.g., mandatory piss tests), they'll vaccinations. seems like really chillax way say ""we're probably still going hit 600,000 dead United States people charge huge states morons."" **Asking providing medical advice allowed - includes speculating dosages, supplements, active ingredients.** cannot responsible health. need general information, please refer CDC's website need specific medical advice, please contact qualified medical professional area.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* true. vaccinated company pushing come (I work 100% remotely successfully) since got first dose. wanted us back two weeks post second dose think it’s harmful company together. Meanwhile, person office building doesn’t office door one seems wear masks. appears confused. rule already exists. FDA requires minimum 6 months median follow assess safety full vaccine approval, 2 months EUA. part aren’t approved yet.

You misunderstood- talking rule requiring people vaccinated talking said ""it approved yet"". point time rule requiring people vaccinated came effect- one vaccines quite aware vaccine drug taken every day. intuitive, point obvious, something body exposed short period time still cause long lasting damage takes become apparent.

Great- care point single instance happened 2018 paper cites areas concern, including, ironically, buildup foreign particles, purport happen “drugs” vaccines:

Except nano-particles mention already used approved drugs since 2018- 6 months ago last checked. mean, home too. former workplace, switched remote made us track work hours.

Within week given stern message boss logged something like 6 hours ""real"" work one days. 

It matter getting work done; mattered owner wanted see least 7.5 hours work logged every day. 

I quit job that, man put strain coworkers. Literally everything. either trolling math comprehension wouldnt let pass elementary school Heck, learned mistake too! Thanks reddit! Truth. take pay cut work home, think saved break room snacks. Somebody Atlantic got vaccine, guess.  Paleontology creationism odds per bible. People think way understand bible paleontology. people interested enough keep track going on. writing style abrasive. You’ll catch flies honey vinegar. Lol, another comment wrote follower Christ. think he'd approve hateful comment, go guess. appreciate contribution spread. writers Atlantic must get paid word. know already CDC vaccine card right? work large healthcare company. 75% vaccinated july. 35%..... many refusing it. internal marketing campaigns trying convince people. absurd.

Personally blame trump divided people fucking bad toted many conspiracies gullible people fighting relatives neighbors. ignorant you. Many nurses staff hospitals choose opt personal reasons. also try inquire rather judge. everyone watches MSM stays constant fear. NJ ton trouble prior pandemic. still barely keep MVC open pandemic going on. Getting regular license ordeal. Maybe gotten better, dont know anyone new card. call widespread. knew getting close to, actually went past, deadline.  way around? Mandatory increased income taxes help pay economic stimulus, future epidemic response measures current future health care costs. Tax credits vaccinated.  even educated nurses, almost education highly specialized technical training that, absolutely critical profession, doesn’t deliver sort classical liberal education critical thinking vital inoculating brain logical fallacies spurious thinking often lead falling conspiracy theories propaganda. Compounded social media silos echo chambers, it’s hardly surprise it’s massive problem is.  Long term side effects aren’t thing vaccinations.

Neither mRNA vaccines now. Hey now, I'm sure get plenty visiting fans Packer, Bear, Viking games. anyone received doses Pfizer vaccine notice worse side effects *first* dose rather *second* one?

I’ve heard case people previously infected virus (although I’d assume evidence would common case?) political signaling since April 2020.

Diamond Princess told us literally everything needed know. current data, year later, bears extremely similar fashion. Suit public transit. Impossible relax. wear underwear. much better. Idk traveled lot partied 20s lol Seems bizarre that, wealth legal experience EU must disposal, made weak contract compared others. Seems like AZ cuts lot Europe's supply contract lets get away most, EU really pour public scorn (which mostly backfires anyway lowers acceptance vaccines manage get).  
 
Although EU brought new powers monitor vaccine exports, would going across north sea without notice? thought designed counter exact issue. appreciate contribution spread. Biden folks relying heavily system established predecessors. Literally nothing changed. vaccine passport? vaccine proven work, valid travel purposes. started forcing people _today_, I'd anti that. 

If becomes FDA approved, clearly shows net positive society, that's I'm pro. course everyone wants numbers decrease further, government quickly rolling vaccines won’t give vaccine stock nations. say exempt since government horrible managing everything, get screwed jump hoops prove cant get vaccinated.  isn´t. America center earth, pandemic ends countries people vaccinated one country. think mental health stop worrying much ""society's tolerance risk"" except insofar actively restricts activity, worry whether personally able engage types behaviors see within reasonable level risk others. Federal politicians public health officials telling getting gradually safer acceptable engage increasing levels in-person activity. generally conservative predictions future timelines, message pretty clear: intend things get back least level ""normal"" encouraged enjoy fun activities person members households without masks within months vaccination mean dangerous anymore, going rolling less restrictive guidelines coming weeks, encouraging states bring back in-person education rapidly possible. way come *different* conclusion hang onto every word try analyze things like exactly big ""small group"" ignoring *broad message* want things move direction opening rather idling persistent restrictions. Meanwhile, every state government gradually (or cases rapidly) increasing types activities permitted crowded allowed be, states even expected start bringing back large in-person events like spectator sports fairly soon. lack clear benchmarks metrics timelines resuming different activities frustrating contributing people getting scared things *won't* return (some semblance of) normal soon, broad trend end onerous restrictions near allowed participate various sorts in-person events within months vaccines widely available. You’d ask FDA chose 6 months mandatory minimum.

Why tell us? fact- tell us clinical trial ""starts""? seem expert thought sub anti-science, would seem, calling FDA safety follow period “formality” they’re experts field, much anti-science.

Is like debate? putting words people's mouths trying twist said?

No one said follow-up period always formality- we're saying formality _in case_. _zero_ evidence serious side-effects- even hint them- trials carefully watched reviewed history.

We also staggering amount data point. Part reason 6 months used trials generally involve smaller number people want allow enough time even rare side-effects manifest. However _millions upon millions_ doses given- odds someone rare sensitivity side-effect getting vaccine reacting go way up.

So yes- point basically formality. vaccines approved one going shocked. I'm 3 free articles month might use Way Back Machine take look. takes one kid transmit another kid virus chance mutate potentially escape vaccine. lunch break 30 minutes. could MAYBE get local vaccination center back traffic. round trip drive. fifteen minute rest make sure allergic reaction? Aint enough time.

And work daycare. Ever feel sick twenty kids screaming face? aint weak!

The best get Friday appt hope get I'm gonna get weekend I'm one gets 24 hour mark. point pick choose.  comprehend incorrectly lol – I feel like folks intentionally dense – this dying. care die. care get others sick thru ignorance selfishness. 

Me heart attack kill grandmother immunocompromised person. Covid &amp; does. 

It's super clear difference. Heart disease comparable. think know this.  Keurig awful invention. K-cups ridiculously priced huge source plastic waste. coffee makes comparable *worse* regular drip machine, already pretty bad.

Honestly use [Hario electric kettle. Makes amazing cup like get cafe. Sure spend little time brewing instead hitting button jogging off, spending minutes morning brewing cuppa honestly kind nice start day mind. They're approved EMA.  number people per 1 mil people got clots vaccine lower many people get anyhow per 1 mil. cant day causes fact number lower general population. company (big recognizable international company) recently sent email saying back summer vaccines mandatory.

Nope. back office. Mandatory remote. Pick one only. would vaccinated people demand unvaccinated people attend work, vaccinated 🤔? fortunately, customers obligation shop place management known motto, ""Screw everyone, time."" workers obligation continue working there. 

Compare contrast Publix, organization treats employees well even offers free antibiotics pharmacies Florida--and way incredibly profitable.

That's good there's free press.  Yeaaaaa no. bothers first couple weeks, people actually starting come together interact positive supportive ways. trolls rolled social media, started seeing lot denial. that, everyone became defensive isolated.

This stuff could built response start. know would still big need mental health, opportunity come together didn't. tell people function another office, allowing someone else ""vaccine"" fear stay WFH, causes divide. need pick choose whole rules apply to. Think way, get shot told required office, another person role hears get coming saying 1 line boss, would feel? pretended pandemic exist even though informed otherwise beforehand,

False. Biden 100k deaths separated children families border

Biden legitimately still this, legitimately take child adult...they taking kids...where think parents are.... also handing trafficker's, told HHS, that's thing...and fact Biden gave false hope every mother mexico, currently crisis border. Ik liberal admit that, 6000 illegal crossings per day biden compared 1000 trump, even called emergency :P

Plus fact immigration Trump :P illegal immigration tried take away healthcare people would die without it

hmm accurate incited insurrection multiple people (some supported him) died take responsibility actions

lol yikes 1000 unhinged humans illegal shit think 1 party blame? LMAO really logical there. .001% people support trump :P Oh yeah really caused insurrection .001% base LMAOOOOOO makes sense...I guess 99.999% didnt get memo LMAOOOOOOOOO took away many rights gay trans people

Like mean could go day

Yet hear say one thing echo chambered cnn...makes sense, try harder Edit again: leave publicly called hit vice president wife kids 

lol oh lord think far gone. Goodluck. think argument post makes lot sense, variable missing change remote work/schooling in-person work/schooling affect pandemic whole individual safety vulnerable.

When say luxury time, mean can't end pandemic short term wait long-term data vaccines (unless enough people infected achieve herd immunity).

If company school plans return in-person activities, way reasonably guarantee safety contracting disease achieve herd immunity.

A company/school either wait happen result personal choices and/or public health policy, actively require members get vaccinated condition in-person employment.

If company passively waits herd immunity allows work-from-home, probably right current vaccination case trends solve problem.

If want return/reopening sooner that, makes sense would mandate vaccination community spread still concern. going issue schools service businesses traditional office employers.

I hope clears position. disagree assertion pandemic over, demand vaccine holding steady understand argument pandemic end else equal. Trump nothing distribution vaccines. Biden seems making effort speed up, far he’s decent job. People: yay got vaccinated!

Work: ok come back work.

People: know expecting. long want live much caution? Since Person likely negative affects covid transmit disease? Person B vaccinated Person B transmits lil covid Person A! Person A’s at-risk roommate dies! Oh god! never see people ever again! lol fuck kind headline this? don’t understand people think hospitals airlines require masks years. reach herd immunity here, would need mask enter hospital? get last ones drop mask requirements really don’t think spring 2022 gonna need mask hospital. Especially since vaccines gonna widely available US soon.  Smear ? Macron charge Italy Austria Denmark Bulgaria Thailand... good reviews AZ coming UK AZ themselves. Ah, I've loop 4 hours day commuting day....I saved around 130 days year plus money. That’s lot Critical thinking comes 4 year degree? taking pretty simplified view things here. understand kneejerk reaction. would obviously get vaccine again, though see might interpreted otherwise. comparison disingenuous. respect sentiment offer better one.

I wonder sentiment unusual. interesting speculate endpoint covid look like, since eradication seems unlikely. definitely ethical considerations vaccination scenario beyond ""everyone time"". 

The experience significant enough make think lot things (as student). also strange interspace genuine dialogue expression ""unified front"" reddit become! someone spent last year tiny apartment myself, never want go back office ever again. miss walking dog 5am dark get ready drive work sit reason. damn work bathrobe living room comfortable chair get extra 2 hours day back. office green carpet too, shit ugly want see again. Pass. made judge juror decide personal reasons make someone “unable”? would feel people kept pressing attacking without knowing exact personal situation? Per CDC information, sounds like “unwilling”. demand take autoimmune conditions

No data available safety efficacy COVID-19 vaccines people autoimmune conditions, though people eligible enrollment mRNA COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. imbalances observed occurrence symptoms consistent autoimmune conditions inflammatory disorders clinical trial participants received COVID-19 vaccine compared placebo. People autoimmune conditions may receive authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Turdeau say wraith Tam?

I'm sick gov't. never asked either. I’m betting three us different states. I’m Arizona. far haven’t met heard anyone post-1a asked proof eligibility state others. Honestly think situation failure way. Yes obviously stranger pay elderly person get vaccinated ideal, still means get shot someone needs it. Much better folks skipping line using means.

The elderly population tough reach ton reasons, many caretakers family rely this. problem, least US, EEOC requires exemptions made available ADA religious freedom. Also, still legitimate rationale requiring employees vaccinated. 

So, nurses direct contact immunocompromised individuals required (subject ADA religious freedom concerns) get flu shot every year. However, difficult enforce requirement run mill office worker employer requiring everyone is/feels safer. EEOC wants limit much control employers private lives employees, makes employer prove reasonability requirement. lot ways, makes sense. 

Most large employers I've heard of, encouraging requiring employees get COVID vaccine. administrative headache processing person claiming can't take vaccine due underlying medical condition religious belief worth it. don’t think difference “law” “FDA procedures require house, senate, president sign bill” yet already pointed twice now- lipid nanoparticles used approved drugs since 2018 study keep citing published. 2 years additional data showing safety perhaps would like keep beating dead horse?

And **I** pointed out, LNPs. immediately apparent, Moderna Pfizer use different LNPs. least one formulations different approved 2018, route administration different too. LNPs long history toxicity, due positive charge serum shreds Where? concern raw mRNA ""floating around"".

I fucking posted article response another one comments dude, since ignored it, I’ll post Potential safety concerns likely evaluated future preclinical clinical studies include local systemic inflammation, biodistribution persistence expressed immunogen, stimulation auto-reactive antibodies ***potential toxic effects non-native nucleotides*** delivery system components People ""desensitized pandemic life"" miserable desperately want able travel socialise normally again. demographics account 99% deaths fully vaccinated May. think people going fine continuing restrictions lives really help anyone? He's longer Detroit. fire coaches every years even though really heart problem. Dan Campbell new coach. I’m trades. Everyday go work I’m direct contact tons people. go gym work, restaurant I’m hungry. Covid doesn’t concern way. ......so ever heard pneumonia naturally born ignorant  it! might people can't afford trackphone, can't handle vaccine app.  think ""Covid booster shots"" physical thing ship *will* needed, think ""Covid booster shots"" thing go pharmacy get *will* needed everyone.

I'd guess CDC figuring plans get vaccines hot spots as-needed general vaccination rates high. too.

Though wait vaccines Canada Biden releases Defense Production Act-held vaccines.

We got go-ahead meeting 10 people outdoors, socially distanced. that's tomorrow - nice picnic park. 

But want hug family, go bar dance ladies eat nachos. employer employees, 80% WFH since last March. remaining 20% mostly need office job functions. 

We surveyed WFH people ask preference returning. don’t think upper management expected third want office even sporadically future.  true, different states different rules. comes mandatory vaccinations past (like seasonal flu vaccine hospital), law generally needs reasonable accommodation like wearing mask.

So, unreasonable employers say ""you need get vaccine can't go work without mask"" get point. year ago Sarah Palin Masked Singer singing Baby Got Back

Tom Hanks got Covid

The NBA reported first ever case shut season down

And hell broke loose day right make decisions regarding put body protected. declined interview offer specifics 

That seems important.

Big difference from, like, requiring masks hospitals indoor gatherings 100+ people versus requiring outdoors. CNA tell tighten daughter car seat tightly taking home hospital. 

She *nowhere near* tight enough car seat time. like, belt barely made contact body, nurse saying, ""hold there, want tight!"" I'll give know long term risks associated Covid, would say long term risks associated vaccine. 

You correct making informed decision, choosing make decision personally benefits so. 

Why delay getting vaccine last possible moment ever? Especially evidence shows someone age health relatively little worry about. 

Also black people reason skeptical vaccine, history nice us regard, skepticism completely unfounded. That’s good. good all. Humans built wear masks social distance. rely social cues faces communicate need socializing healthy. many acting like rewire means human? long term side effects? like say five years gotten one starters. even two years. six months? anyone kind study around that? oh wait can't. still new. already are! passes peak demand curve certain group passes it’s better expand eligibility keep moving case others, terminated lease early laid receptionists, janitors, catering staff, such. also weren’t paying utilities terminated lease.   right private businesses choose whether want employees vaccinated not. employer requires don’t wanna.. find new job doesn’t require it. need go read replies original comment see normal people respond. Maybe could productive discussion.

I'm trolling Wow didn’t even think that. Yes. get much sleep too! went rural college specialized nursing conservative part country. say like dumb jocks campus. nursing major lot 100 level courses. didn’t give shit subject outside field sat back liberal arts classes goofed off. don’t think education level much this. think comes culture region, politics person’s family, general upbringing. Current science denialism around Covid rooted deep seated resentment political establishment rejection liberalism overall. People reject common sense school training feed hate monster inside them. Many, American conservatives actively enjoy fact consider political enemies nervous fearful catching Covid. That’s they’re bratty masks, vaccines preventative measures. Right still need ends hope entire AZ board gets sued oblivion EU. ""best effort"" would least effort be? Soirot landing middle Brussels shooting people sight? Come think it, would probably cause less deaths this. Interesting. Source this? coworker old folks home routinely hands medicine shots, complaining staff got shots ""filling bodies poison"". also said going smoke less minute later seeing irony. people smart. ne nurse knew talking something saw Facebook pfizer

I mean, makes sense. Pharmaceutical companies absolutely earned reputation putting profits ahead people. saved us here, vaccines marvels, like suspicion coming nowhere. Super accurate description honestly. Well whether consent not, it’s better humanity get it. wouldn’t really say ostracizing though, I’m saying can’t still jobs contribute society, I’m saying shouldn’t allowed planes risk covid such. never happen lmao. want restrict Covid infected migrants traveling around US too?  completely fair, smearing started AZ got caught vaccine race released misleading data. That's Wolf State DOH following CDC distribution guidelines begin with. Employers already sticking non-vaccinated workers ways. CDC confirmed vaccinated people longer quarantine exposure COVID positive individual. means vaccinated workers continue work without missing 2 weeks work. Many incentivizing vaccine encourage fence. vaccine widely available, at-will states chose get vaccinated miss work due symptomatic COVID may fired unpaid full 2 weeks missing work. Employers want people show work reliable. constant rotating quarantines enough reason want hire vaccinated workers only. incredible, really. even long commute! take away extra time needed look like professional + drive time + early office saving hour day working home. someone explain blood clot thing came from? “People basic right body autonomy”

Apparently states prohibiting procedure. basic right body autonomy would suggest could couldn’t get procedure would Basic Right. surely ""those conditions prevent getting vaccinated"" included category ""unvaccinated people""? Unless also proposing that, alongside vaccine passpost, also create 'unable vaccinated' passport? Additionally, happens multiple people unable vaccinated want use office, allow spread virus other, 1 need excluded? Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted online, English, throughout United States. 

So anyone felt like clicking poll? said nationwide, ensure represents nationwide views? I'm saying wrong, I'm trying understand better, absolutely way poll accurately reflects opinions people live area. assume would people treat anti-vaxx movement schools whatnot. idea *choose* get vaccinated, restricted, *cannot* vaccinated due medical reason restricted. Oh yeah, arm sore hell too. worst part bit fatigued generally felt like shit though. Really felt like hangover Great idea. There's lot elderly folks difficulties accessing vaccine variety reasons (difficulty leaving home, inability drive, difficulty scheduling online, etc.). Anything help worthwhile. concerned unvaccinated people even vaccinated vaccine much less effective new variants (especially B.1.351) unvaccinated people are, chances mutations arise.

So LITTLE less concerned, LOT less concerned. fully FDA approved

so cigarettes. victim

So admit trolling? get vaccinated permanently Working Hom?
Nice. Ah yes good point, rule instituted vaccine fully approved wouldn’t issue.

Look I’m sure disagree much, except fact *strongly* opposed considering medical experiments timetables dictated panels experts “formalities”. cannot agree that.

Oh, no. LNPs LNPs vaccines. fact can’t be, Moderna Pfizer different LNPs

Edit: oh - regards Great- care point single instance happened vaccine?

You look the, uh, what’s called, national vaccine injury fund shit. actually table proven side effects timeframes showing up, people paid fund they’re injured. side effects manifest pretty late. People downvoting truth like crazy thread. abortion law requiring people get procedure? We’re 2.4 million day right now. imagine increase massively coming months   common rule vaccines, concerns specific medical conditions kept away getting COVID vaccine? No, restrictions wouldn’t apply medical reason preventing getting vaccine. idea people can’t get vaccine medical reason means everyone get gets vaccine sufficient immunity protect can’t.  I'm happy let explain risks me. Explain away public make informed health decisions. 

I'm staunchly getting make public policy based solely germs scary. mean nobody saying that's (well weirdos are) currently is. Unless state regs union rules place preventing it, vaccine status protected class, openly fire somebody refusing. flawed system, current system. I'm sure helps, bit #crps, nerve damage, chronic pain, 4 hours first dose pfizer, wrenched nerve pain. 

I'm afraid 2 dose, I'll still get 18 th 👌 get 7:30am instead 5:30am now. sleep worth it.  Hopefully it'll phase 4 summer!  Fucking awful. wonder there’s much vaccine hesitancy. What’s point even mass vaccination, still wear masks distance? FDA Approved = trust scientists. 

There's sure thing here. vaccine may prove side effects. weigh possibility vs letting Covid continue 30% population refusing vaccine. Yeah fam. I'd rather see X amount people vaccinated meant instead introducing inefficiencies system try weed out. Nobody going forget people medically exempt. offense, difficulty believing legitimate concern. people planning kinds vaccination passport type things dummies. Well, explains pandemic spread much summer weren’t able get control. think two bubbles America right now, it’s
not strictly state. 

There’s one group Americans, like me, masking avoiding meeting anyone except household 3-5 friends entire year. assumed America like people talk (including dozens people know many different states including South Carolina, Utah Missouri) everything avoid getting people sick. includes eating inside restaurants etc even regulations said could. That’s one bubble. 

On hand, clearly big group people gathering living life normally since end April, restricted government regulations caring spread virus long it’s allowed law. another bubble think pandemic acting normally months. think bubble paranoid restricting freedoms, first bubble blames bubble spreading virus making sacrifices good others. 

I understand impulses sides, it’s stupid pretend pandemic one’s bubble things back normal. Excuse me, I’m marketing side job entire time company started server 8 years ago. career company put lot time sweat came successful side. 

Be quitter want, decided handle business company believe earned first dose received last weekend well coworkers gave seeing families year make sure company lasted. earned early doses respect helping keeping food sector afloat. restaurants weren’t making purchases you’d paying $80 pound chicken today even lucky enough available. 

You obviously don’t know type strength conviction takes go sit down. Totally! I've WFH year, I'm productive less hours (most days), commute 60 miles round trip (bought house WAY job) turned video game workout time. glorious.

I also miss office chatter. :D semantics point -- pool eligible recipients still small relative population, rollout still constrained far supply distribution administration regime, two months ago. 

And again, Biden's plan really marginally better Trump's was, per WaPo article. handful federal vaccination centers running works feds done better job communicating states private partners, actual mechanism Biden using get shots arms pretty much one Trump put place. Certainly strides commendable, night day difference Biden Trump far availability vaccines. they're expense leaving money table. Competitors bull-headed way advantage bottom line well likely attractive better employees. Wrong. FDA full discretion fully approve. 6 months median minimum follow law, process decided appropriate. could change tomorrow wanted, there’s need change statutes.

Really- think pedantry helps point here? right- said rule- regardless- FDA can't change rules whim. would provide justification said- change would fuel Lipid nanoparticles extremely toxic don’t retain negative charge serum, took long time get “right”.

And yet already pointed twice now- lipid nanoparticles used approved drugs since 2018 study keep citing published. 2 years additional data showing safety perhaps would like keep beating dead There’s concerns raw mRNA floating around, persistence expressed immunogen.

Where? concern raw mRNA ""floating around"". entire problem mRNA broken fast time work. Even modern techniques barely lasts long enough produce Yeah, fuckin sounds like something might want wait panel scientists FDA decided right follow period, pass.

Thanks least proving apparently know difference cardio-vascular disease virus :)

Seriously- think things similar hope god medicine medical research. 32 here. Also worst year life. think safe assumption worst behind this. Speaking methods content, online polls like useless actually representative American sentiment. 

Don't take numbers face value, could much higher lower depending poll conducted. Same, mathed out.

If took bus every day, it’d cost $4 day half hour waiting+travel direction, $960 year. spend hour day walking stop, waiting bus, walking work.

When biked, cost nothing $600 spent bike, 40 minutes way — work late, near-misses biking dark even lights on, rain sucks. Figured life worth price car, so...

Got car. Insurance costs 500 year, oil changes maint probably another 600 nothing bad happens, barely buy gas nowadays, 300 year. 10 minute commute way, wait times. Probably twice expensive yearly bussing, plus initial pay, save whole hour every day!

Now option working home, could save time even car would cost NOTHING! Working home superior option it’s available. victim. Open mind learn wonders. Ok, I'll tell next employer wants drug test see works out. (I take medication shows drug tests).  I’d love believe it’s Governors office I’ll take salt lick Thanks explaining situation. haven’t vaccination site, don’t know it’s like. vax sites read paper appointment only. 

I think imaged scenario like this: call, say, Walgreens two hours pharmacy closes see shots spoil someone doesn’t take them. Maybe someone didn’t show appointment. shot available, could go get it, assuming one meets criteria better gets first. 

That scenario maybe isn’t fraught ethical problems creating long lines discourage people? 22 reported blood cloths + 2 deaths (1 DK, 60 yr old woman) Danish Health Authorities (Not government) decided pause AZ 2 weeks, give time investigate gather information. 

Why damaging public perception vaccination paused 2 weeks ? prefer authorities cautious whatever stuff going injected with. find link deaths AZ vaccine, fine. 

Don't worried ""The public perception"" - democracy live right informed people actually handle quite lot information. real unknown point Janssen, state still committed original goals.

I'm still committed becoming astronaut. /s?? say that. can't say ""everyone party now"". Yeah, it’s generally inverse correlation- younger people, stronger immune systems, tend experience much side effects older people. 

Also, get side effects first dose already Covid. me, n= obv, mild case Covid December walloped first dose Moderna- hobbling around like old man day chills body aches fatigue. swear people like Stockholm syndrome pandemic data J&amp;J probably wont months least.

J&amp;J *is* good. No-one died even got hospitalized it. Hell 15% serious symptoms.  saw local Walmart Moderna vaccines due low amount receiving, vaccinating people 65 up. Joe Biden beach state, shows. Shit needs open Memorial Day weekend, ruins whole summer season! It’s based tax years figure what/if pay people, like guy said it’s actually prepayment 2021 taxes. 100% exactly two stimulus checks were. 

Just feels like it’s 2021 tax prepayment absolutely make true lmao. It’s tax credit 2021 taxes paying early everyone. “prepayment” 2021 tax returns. Last year worked way prepayment tax credit 2020 tax year. 

Your whole argument feels like it’s 2021 tax year prepayment “for intents purposes, yada yada” you’re simply wrong there’s nothing make right. Although I’m sure won’t believe argue day doesn’t feel seem like 2021 tax credit prepayment therefore somehow isn’t don’t feel like is. Although is. 

What’s really terrible reddit trend downvote guy who’s giving correct information upvote who’s spreading false information online whatever reason sounds better reader. unfortunately common happening right now. It’s depressing vaccines better are. Trump’s horrific faults pandemic, least administration bet right horse. 1400 dollar checks complete insult people. Offered one thing. point better feasible path taking shot. thing scavenging leftovers. Seeking shouldering higher risk people way using stolen codes something else. sounds like maryland, except added complication every retail, hospital, county, state run site slightly different rules eligibility strains contagious reproduce faster inside body, better moving people (to knowledge). Viral load correlates strongly severity, spread symptom onset there's nothing counter that. 

It leave room high variability apparent contagiousness depending careful isolation symptoms start. Damn would suck Vaccines aren’t get jail free card...even 6 months now?  Good luck 70% adults vaccinated convincing social distance say so. best news year Durability. Sure first dose highly effective durability benefits question mark tell screw government counts one ever get vaccine since forever earmarked them? 

probably lie might work? Totally possible. bet it’s localized problem nightmare Feds. Looks like he’s trying deal it. remember reading bachelor subreddit covid 19 threads one girl said home state told may get vaccinated December. back January though Trump brought up? praise saved people made vaccine people volunteered trials. 

Trump could saved many American lives minimizing risk covid trying suggest covid related election.

As non-American, Trump's response covid seemed pretty irresponsible. back pat signing check. California outdoor stadiums going fans starting April 1st Pfizer Hangover sounds like terrible cocktail company asked months ago extra technology, equipment supplies needed work home sent us. Also, still send us snacks coffee mail.

I love work. correct typo it'll look really horrible, given context.

the odds much favour, bet it'll go smoothly. halfway almost full protection individual vaccination, way nicer times. :) Easily be. 60% 65+ received least one vaccine shot, medically vulnerable individuals huge amount people, 1.5 months plenty time vaccines available them. Vote exit. Save yourself. tagging look back later. i've wondering thing. Except that’s true. days away finishing since December.

We need bypass EU arrange purchase orders. much depends it. right here! Gonna obvious real quick path makes money, masks required path ain't it. Hoping end may even 30s someone US trial 100% got vaccine placebo gives great, great joy. 

Hope they’re able finish trial get approval ASAP. Seems typically non-relevant individuals suddenly became relevant starting see limelight starting fade. - it’s desperate attempt keep “importance”. I’m ready people go away let us make decisions. Nope that’s they’re fine Arizona 24 hour scheduling mass sites. 

Even don’t want 24/7...7am 8pm starting last week March would doable daylight hours. I’m ready party lol NVAX %96 efficacy %86 new variant per today’s news UK . may get EUA March UK  wish could say local co-workers. international ones better. 

We also listen dude like one described, funny 😂 Careful now, we'll make another boomer generation Roaring 20's 2.0 incoming. Droplets everyone! country didn’t start imploding Covid, well way that. Unfortunately many Western Democracies are. It’s really unfortunate, thanks chipping WW2. Sorry guess started Trump still here, would may. Probably even 2022 baby steps start now, 4 months. mean... That's people kept saying initial lockdown, way nine months ago uhh sounds like he's saying small gatherings Holy shit... 6 weeks... realized may 1st 6 weeks away... 

This shit coming close Riiight, right, one single year don’t think lockdown long, especially vaccines cases falling. still continue masking, social distancing, washing hands frequently longer. Finally, good fucking news Anyone familiar bill? Ive work past years went back living dad due injury. I'm 28 he's claiming dependent cause provides half income. doubt he's claiming disabled dependent. eligible receive 1400 adult dependent? best tell dad claim dependent taxes year? anything except brokering deals procure vaccine signing legislation would allocate funding vaccine distribution... Gonna get downvoted buuuut good thing Trump got vaccine done started rollout Biden. 10 million AZ, come surprise newest member EU &lt;checks India.

EU also sourcing jabs lot slower approve everything. fucked without mask! Unless Biden shits vaccines I'm sure thinks direct states that. I'm sure 100 millionth got put arm day two ago it'll cool see official metrics catch up. 

My county starting ton J&amp;J too, look forward seeing fully vaccinated column start shoot up. body ready.  don’t get whole “you people” mentality. That’s wholly unnecessary. 

Again - nothing vaccines conspiracy theorist. going let live data guide lab data all. 

If perceive unreasonable statement thing believe, I’m sure similar ideals reasonability. won’t see wave first world, probably 3rd world countries even behind us EU plebs. one. seems plausible fever comes vaccines general could bad baby pregnant woman. CDC mentions site discussing flu vaccine. also mention discussing COVID vaccine ACIP meeting YouTube. 

I can't find mechanism negative side effects baby regards breast milk. missing something? Sorry hear that! Yup, we’re set! Well, month six weeks get vaccine party... everyone seems forgetting Liberal who's daddy paid Harvard. told sister bit afraid especially side effects, response: “you wanna live don’t you” me. get side effects infusion treatment receive 2x year NY BMI qualification. That’s lot us ready go 😆 That’s honestly pretty weird anti-social. think would negative effect interaction people day day. think harm involved. reason think wear mask sick. think would positive social norm. Hmm dang sick could taste coming lol. Good question though. Maybe somebody else know. 

I don’t want get second shot allergic reaction it. *cries 16 year old* Good you. best friend maskless wedding November 40+ people got Covid. yes city going allow large gatherings? know wedding scheduled July, won’t able 50 people.  It’s heads True results similar (94% efficacy) group healthcare workers SIRENS study reinfections. Love idea COVID vaccine almost impossible find receive! better luck getting PS5! I’d curious know threshold would able person classes 3.1M doses shipped yet reported administered. Source CDC dashboard: looks like Black Widow menu, means following films time area problem enough people willing take it.  state anyone 16 health condition (and slightly overweight smoking health conditions list thers something list almost everyone) still walk get vaccine without waiting.  wish people would vaccinate here!  That's stated plan ""any american wants vaccine get vaccine""

The US ordered dosses need vaccinate everyone soooo ready headache, fever malaise. Bring it!! truly wild. NBA suspended season year ago today, felt like everything kinda changed immediately. pandemic one things never expect deal with, pretty incredible own. We're long removed novel diseases regularly killing scores people. first pandemic hit America hard century, got vaccines less year. Truly wild, never take social aspects life granted ever grateful live time science rapidly solve problems July 4th BBQ friends....not large events first shot June. Second shot spaced 4 months out. Hopefully less 4 months wouldn’t get hopes up. shit bout lit 🔥 

Pro tip: pee sex, prevents utis ;) Yeah...I think year+ worth told media shaking hands someone literally going kill going undone two months.

It's going take time deprogram masses. expect lot summer celebrations awkward anything, people try maintain 2-3 feet social distance making eye contact flinching every time someone sneezes coughs. 

Eventually give go back Netflix enjoy wear mask store, reposting old pictures 2018 social media clout.

Perhaps Fall people comfortable public.  I've met zero people vaccine symptoms 24 hours. Methinks may exaggerating going on. thought wasnt reccomended compromised immune system. Ah see. bad read comment fast Kinda makes ya wonder much better we'd outbreak happened year, instead last.

Gonna say we'd 1000% better approach response. think people shut-ins want classes stay online, think they're misinformed. don’t buy all. India several times seeing absolute lack proper infrastructure, number likely factor 10. Depressed? exactly. presence kids spouse 24/7/365 enough drive lot us abstinence! pushed back September finally feels like might work. Yes! Live bearded viking dream! telling there's chance? Especially us living cold climates. We've pretty much staying inside since late fall 2019 winter sucks. September puts us right doorstep cold misery. There's way we're giving two summers things improving way are. get ramping opening time rather once. doesn’t mean saying “hey hang friends Fourth July” okay guess what, many us already small gatherings. haven’t, shouldn’t told wait four months so. exactly.. Biden buying gas countries instead making here. Yes biden helping covid better trump. also unneeded bombings.. anything fighting china... Good luck, people can’t even get second shot time. gonna happen. I'm fine ""the temporary suspension intellectual property rights vaccine formula organizations make it"".

Fuck ""Everyone needs give vaccine poorer countries"". Everyone agrees vaccines need go people at-risk contracting first. countries, means front-line workers old people. global scale, Americans died it, therefore, Americans keep vaccines citizens. many goddamn people know want it.  Funny Israel became hot new holiday destination remember first time heard entered US. knew going long year also 5 months pregnant time. Watching president declare national state emergency people discussing full hospitals pop tent triage wards know going need one hospitals months pretty awful. Hearing women pregnancy groups discuss told giving birth alone, even partner them.. terrified. Thankfully husband able there, barely. 2 days induced husband got call 6pm saying someone he'd worked closely tested positive covid. went got test 20 min later. couch crying phone mom wondering it, would give birth alone (my mom high risk chance either us it),and baby would get seperated birth. mean, didn’t say anyone get vaccinated. called anti-vaxxers goddamned selfish morons. people concerned catching COVID waiting vaccination people suddenly going clubs engaging risk taking behavior. 

When go back normal, it’ll likely 2019 1920 me. get shots, HELLO WORLD!!! Gonna see everywhere 😂 I’ll remain control group. Enjoy vaccines kids 96%? like 75 initially? happened? Pffft, went 28 years without fucking. Usually concern deltoid IM injections. Shoot, even air IV huge concern. deltoid IM injections though, SIRVA main concern. Yeah okay dude reasonable discussion acting like asshole. Securing us tons vaccine supply....at expense global population. Please remember every healthy young American getting vaccine now, at-risk person another country able get one much, much later. I'm 30+, getting weekend I'm little confused this. seems like states fairly well rollout. feel like states would probably point May 1 without direction. 

In case, let's say states ready. vaccine shortages? 95% effectiveness mean ""95% vaccinated people get COVID"" means ""vaccinated people 95% less likely get COVID unvaccinated people"", make sense due masks distancing.  He's pretty lucky major holdups coronavirus response (with exception relief package, that's congress). set backs delayed vaccine rollout, J&amp;J vaccine work out, etc. may well likely June even early fall. Id much rather someone give conservative estimate pleasantly surprised things go better best case scenario annoyed things worse. got rid air shooters hepatitis spread recipient recipient. contacts skin there's sometimes blood.

People basic training pretty healthy, apparently hep. Keep pumping!!! Cant fucking wait summer! (up to) four month wait due getting many doses many people quick possible. get everyone one dose, give second dose soon (but sooner 3 weeks). no, wait October study doesn’t claim better Moderna. trying claim? I’ve literally defending Moderna entire thread  wife emerging bubble kids (5 &amp; 2) starting school / preschool person next week. 

This past year challenging many fronts, vaccines became available non-medical workers, worked hard quickly vaccinate vulnerable, elderly, at-risk people lives. 

From January 15th today, wife made 300 vaccine appointments eligible folks lives (and spiraling friends loved ones well). hit 300 today first Pfizer appointment tomorrow teenage girl, former student wife daughter friend. girl hasn’t public year risky conditions. wife cried told got appointment, even though we’ve secured 299 prior. 

These micro-glimmers hope past two months really propelled us towards positive outlook year ahead. We’re retiring weekend (it’s bit consuming), mission accomplished. I'm taking beard cut year Renn Faire. Gonna Viking costume year. I'm kind hoping good enough Canada

Same...if AstraZeneca enough Canada without US trial finishing...this basically vaccine drives I've participated in. One type: drive stall 6 feet another car, registration comes paperwork makes sure eligible. Vaccinator comes, checks conditions may keep person either receiving one stay monitored longer 15 minutes, gives shot, signs paperwork. Vaccine assistant arrives finalizes paperwork, explains things, answers questions, etc. Monitors roam rows cars looking people distress let people go appropriate.

The walk-in drives essentially same. Person waits line, 6 feet apart others. Registration helps fill forms people waiting line. Person front line gets called station. Vaccinator goes checks, administers shot. Vaccine assistant walks person chair monitoring area finishes paperwork, explains things, answers questions. Monitors watching signs distress. cases, vaccine prep team filling syringes vaccinations runners run vaccinator/vaccinator assistant teams.

With 8 teams vaccinator/vaccinator assistant, drive administer average 120-140 vaccines per hour proper traffic control. walk-in 5 teams able vaccinate 60-80 people per hour. [hot beef   Miss EDC.

Wiping load groceries take upwards 30-45 minutes depending many groceries. time spent addition typical time takes put everything away. could also seen socially embarrassing people knew it. I’m also little worried year this, may stop pandemic ends.

There’s still part gets satisfaction it. It’s reassurance. chances getting covid touching groceries 0.1%, maybe reduced 0.001% wiping everything down. know people live fucking sticks got it. must gone Spokane Wenatchee. president also like maybe 5% gas prices Yeah thank you. wouldn’t comment lowering cost new minimum still want large wedding. wanted postpone. said no. court might go! Good luck yours! Novavax gets approved next month, could used end June deadline 1 shot per adult Canadian.

Those 100 million vaccines addition [800 government contracted purchase August. vaccinated parent infecting child unlikely.

Vaccinated people aren’t considerable risk, unvaccinated people higher risk around virus circulating high levels. problem study, likely reason different (better) results Moderna one, used lab-engineered virus, actual thereby produced three recombinant viruses representing lineages two additional ones engineered subsets mutations B.1.351 lineage.

In absence data, safest assume Moderna Pfizer protective sterilizing benefit B.1.351 - Moderna trial indicative vaccines' performance.

Off topic: Moderna begun Phase 1 trial B.1.351 spike booster, mass producing would easy mass producing original. difference might need three shots instead two. new site launched recently tried here? 

No idea WA I’ve gotten 3 eligible family members vaccinated since February well couple friends. 

I haven’t used site linked since wasn’t around looking, assuming seriously overworked field help get appointment message me. power grid annihilated little snow. That’s better taxes got us. Everyone vaccine group placebo group following precautions. 95 percent derived checking many people got sick vaccine group vs. placebo group. So, no, results going skewed, following masking distancing policies everyone else was. Even stopped distancing wearing masks right moment, vaccinated people would still 95 percent less likely get covid unvaccinated person.

There's big misconception 95 percent protection means. ""95 percent vaccinated people can't get covid now,"" ""if vaccinated 95 percent less likely get covid weren't."" course. anyone else running low. There's going big surge births happening Q1 '22. actually proof right vaccine doesn’t make carrier. really. bunch Cubans Hialeah / Miami got convinced voting Biden would usher socialism authoritarianism. year two nothing happened, enough may realize Trump lying them. hope. states particularly lax bribery laws?


Asking friend. car dealership today salesman got stuck insisted blood made immune covid knows 3 people died 2nd shot... I’m sure many opt getting vaccine pure ignorance. interpreted mean give anyone wants it, even people need don’t yet it. 

If people need then, that's certainly Biden's fault way. That'd likely fault government specific state. “Start” lol.

I’ve watching otherwise smart, responsible people less less careful every day many months, now. really downside this? Businesses individuals make decisions much risk comfortable with. Businesses keep mask rules want, people free go businesses still taking precautions. cases low, collective issue. medical infrastructure danger, vulnerable people vaccinated. one thing I’ve learned States don’t anything Biden says tell!! Somehow realist scared USA dumb beyond saving aren’t fucking gouging Canada leftover vaccines! GTFO nonsense!

I'm mistaken, originally creating mRNA vaccines candidate create SARS MERS vaccines, discovering COVID-19 coronavirus ingredients becoming world-wide pandemic virus, quickly retrofitted knowledge equipment expediting vaccine using mRNA.

The reason even took year needed know COVID-19, pass lot emergency clearances, complete trials, start ramping mass production.

The reason *only* took year steps could be, thus done parallel one another.

So anyone claiming want vaccine ""it took year create"" grossly underestimating nuances medical science breakthroughs happen, often humanity desperate. Almost UK miniscule vaccine production industry, literally set last months, vaccines export.

Production UK's two sites roughly 2 million doses week can't even keep domestic demand, resulting vaccinations meaningfully speeding last weeks.

Look closer home instead trying steal people's vaccines. EU approved Indian plant standards, approved yet. Thankfully stepped in

**MAKING MONEY**

Building vaccine production capacity makes sense given need vaccinate world, potentially repeatedly, COVID-19, well threat future pandemics.

But large manufacturing sites efficient point, extra capacity spread across many countries may economical.

Prashant Yadav, senior fellow U.S.-based Center Global Development, said advantages scale kick produce least 100 million doses per year.

He believes four five countries could likely scale without raising costs, many build small operations, “I think get point everybody end paying higher price.”

In Canada, federal government building publicly-owned facility Montreal would make 2 million vaccine doses per month beginning next year, leaving well 100 million annual dose threshold.

Asked small size raise costs, Canada’s National Research Council said meant compete private sector: “The objective facility respond quickly future health emergencies.” Maybe consequence vaccinating people already infected ? real! get “just cold” generally dry cough weeks worst symptoms dissipate. [4]

It’s similar picture others, including vaccines made Russia China, hitches common trying accelerate production across multiple sites borders. Switzerland-based Lonza Group AG makes ingredients Moderna’s vaccine go Spain put vials. J&amp;J’s shot made Netherlands sent United States bottling. Pfizer-BioNTech contracted factories across network 13 sites meet production needs year - supplies Europe also briefly fell short plant re-engineered.

But friction AstraZeneca EU Brussels continued chafe since supplier drugmaker Seneffe, Belgium ran difficulty January.

AstraZeneca’s vaccine production starts living cells infected modified form virus. cells grown tanks, bioreactors, harvested purified two months. active ingredient created, water proteins added liquid bottled - stage known ‘fill finish.’ Sometimes, different stages happen different sites.

Problems Belgian plant, combined AstraZeneca’s contractual commitments supply United Kingdom, meant even though product involved made short drive Brussels, EU citizens left wanting.

The German company IDT Biologika plans cover stages cycle. German vaccine developers BioNTech SE CureVac NV, forefront new vaccine technology received government funding, also part Germany’s cluster. BioNTech recently brought new German plant online produce 750 million doses per year pharma giant Bayer AG help make CureVac’s shot.

The developers Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, also made inquiries producing region, Saxony-Anhalt premier Haseloff said. Russia’s sovereign wealth fund Russia’s Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), promoting Sputnik V internationally, declined comment.  expect 50-60 percent population fully vaccinated end May depending much J&amp;J administered. underplays aggressively, makes people doubt legitimacy federal government's guidelines.

If going underplay, would want say something conservative like, ""We're going open vaccines everyone May 1, goal every willing adult vaccinated July."" [3]

Berlin targeting annual capacity 2 billion COVID vaccine doses IDT facilities, person familiar matter told Reuters. comparison, AstraZeneca stated ambitions produce 3 billion doses vaccine end year, would make largest COVID-19 vaccine producer globally.

Berlin’s target could prove far excess EU’s needs 450 million people, isn’t yet clear often vaccinations needed bolster immunity.

The COVID pandemic unprecedented challenge inoculate billions. drugs badly needed near term, piecemeal plans reflect lack coherent global strategy cover vaccination pandemic, world needs, according Robert Van Exan, consultant former Sanofi executive.

“It takes time build infrastructure properly, thought go it,” Van Exan said.

LESSONS LEARNED
Previous vaccine disputes allies served prelude COVID-era fight supplies.

In flu scare 1976, United States blocked vaccine exports, derailing vaccination plan Canada. Ottawa learned lesson: H1N1 flu pandemic 2009, bought drugs local producer, waited outbreak largely donating extra doses World Health Organization.

And then, years 2009 pandemic, Washington paid hundreds millions several companies build expand private facilities could used make package pandemic vaccine short notice within country’s borders.

When COVID-19 hit, least two sites became part Operation Warp Speed, producing vaccines Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca Moderna Inc . Federal officials used Defense Production Act put participating companies first line supplies made U.S. companies, U.S. Army Corps Engineers directly oversaw construction projects. companies struggled hire enough qualified staff, 16 Department Defense employees sent work quality control two manufacturing sites, according recent federal report.

**RUBIK’S CUBE**

Globally, vaccines manufactured across drug firms’ existing networks often need pass several countries - even continents - ready inject arms. Within EU alone, 30 plants Sweden Spain involved production COVID-19 vaccines. AstraZeneca says manufacturing capacity 25 sites across 15 countries, chain partnerships one company executive likens Rubik’s Cube puzzle. [2]


India plays significant role vaccine production globally, United States, Japan Australia also plan help finance vaccine production capacity there, senior U.S. administration official told Reuters.

The moves aim address global shortage doses. vaccines key restart economies, countries pre-purchase agreements secure supply.

**2 BILLION DOSES**

The vaccine crunch Europe shown states depend deliveries multinationals vulnerable. January, AstraZeneca cut supplies bloc half first second quarters, told Brussels able divert Belgian-made drugs earmarked United Kingdom. cut heightened tensions London Brussels prompted European leaders set curbs exports vaccines made EU - starting month, Italy blocked exports AstraZeneca’s shot.

Germany net importer vaccines, $720 million trade deficit area. Berlin plans change that, Germany’s former “Bacterial Institute Anhalt Counties” Dessau help. family-owned firm called IDT Biologika, AstraZeneca plan invest 100 million euros ($120 million) expand plant factory complete vaccines.

The company says aims make 30 million 40 million doses month end 2022, producing bulk vaccine also dispensing vials, Chief Executive Juergen Betzing told Reuters would make one Europe’s biggest manufacturers add capacity least 360 million doses year within EU.

Germany yet reserved right purchase vaccines, government wants come plan measures support incentivise long-term vaccine production capacity May 1, according document seen Reuters. government source said drug company representatives told Berlin long-term purchase guarantees would important investment decisions aid.

The IDT plant also able produce vaccines companies and, together cluster firms Saxony-Anhalt, form heart government strategy make Germany new centre vaccine production Europe. [1]

DESSAU, Germany (Reuters) - German town Dessau, one sites Bauhaus art school, institute set 1921 mass-produce vaccines later helped strengthen German Democratic Republic. Exactly 100 years later, site gearing one-stop shop produce COVID-19 vaccines Germany’s pandemic response.

It’s one example rash efforts governments across globe access fragmented vaccine production, manufacturing setbacks deprived European Union members drugs made soil year. Australia Thailand, states planning home-based vaccine plants starting reshape industry.

The German venture backing regional government, part national effort secure supplies add vaccines Germany’s exports. Saxony-Anhalt premier Reiner Haseloff said believes Germany could become swing producer vaccines, way power companies maintain capacity times strong demand.

“Ultimately, comparable energy industry, state also pays keep power plants reserve,” Haseloff told Reuters.

Unlike United States, government’s Operation Warp Speed began funding expansion retrofit pharmaceutical manufacturing sites early pandemic, countries globally option commandeer factories. German plan one half dozen governments around world avert shortages supporting drug companies’ local production.

Some - including Australia, Brazil, Japan Thailand - setting manufacturing partnerships Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca PLC. Elsewhere, Italy pledged state backing public-private vaccine production centre, Austria, Denmark Israel plan joint research development fund explore whether produce next-generation vaccines.

Yes bit hairsplitting point people need aware distinction undermine progress we've made especially metric important levels comfort american agree keep vaccines around we're using them. seems like common sense. However, v rather giving Europe I'd give Mexico somewhere Caribbean closer ability produce vaccines. AZ completely messed trials that's completely frankly shocking pharma giant calibre. turn made lot people rightfully skeptical initial data which, rate, showed far lower efficacy Pfizer/Moderna.

They also blatantly overpromised underdelivered orders EU (and elsewhere). Again, entirely them.

In short, come across untrustworthy/incompetent business well scientific perspective. 

The ""vaccine nationalism"" coming UK utterly toxic seems source idea kind deliberate anti-British propaganda. frankly absurd given desperately European nations need vaccine Germany one produced ""its own"" far.

You understand, good news AZ countries, media dominated exciting news surrounding Pfizer/Moderna, mostly positive news JJ (there challenges around lower efficacy). Everyone excited, especially given Biden’s announcement adults quality May 1st. know enough everyone wants one really soon. 

Our first big introduction AZ messed dosing trials. see AZ pulled countries, whether agree not. AZ isn’t getting good press here. 

America start vaccine diplomacy working way help countries get AZ may originally wanted. We’re set 36 million available June, could realistically take 7 months get administered? It’s HIPAA get Pfizer vaccine, approved people 16 up! kind people maskless wedding people guilt, shame morals. Eu regulator could check every batch like UK regulator does. they're lazy. EU also slow agree contracts - they're lazy. also set domestic manufacturing plants - they're lazy. mean three AZ plants Eu supplying 450 million people. three plants Uk supplying 67 million people.

AZ sold cost, profit AZ money set new plants. EU stepped in. didn't, they're lazy. Look Texas specific vaccine hunter groups Facebook. one Alabama great helping people find doses. Unfortunately, lots people struggled securing second moderna dose (not sure why) groups helped hunt down. understand WTF going EU facilities.

Other countries now: ""Waaaahhhh! America solving problems us? buy vaccines distribute us? dare take extra work compensate horrible COVID response! America hoarding That's Murica you. deeply selfish nation matter president is, political thing, cultural thing.

For last 12 months world especially Canada EU completely shat US's Covid-19 response literally calling Americans ignorant subhuman fucks. sort plan defeating virus suddenly selfish entitled pricks hoard things meant countries. it’s used doesn’t mean won’t start going arms within weeks. They’re process getting final approvals. 

As far real question hand IP rights claims vaccine, I’m bit torn. believe widely distributed available produced overseas. However, companies compensated R&amp;D costs developing successful vaccines. Like companies made vaccines insane amount profit early market. set precedent socialize results work disincentivizes developing new unique vaccines treatments future. see AZ authorised US yet, look UK's data shows excellent. 15 hours. arm typically feels sore flu shot, far feels similar me.

Me too! know thread full terrible stories wanted share good ones saw. think it’s important highlight good stories too, promise still shred humanity left.

Here NYC everyone masked fuck up. Neighbors sewed masks others started selling extras coffee shops. outliers course, everyone stepped up.

People gave away extra subway cards hospital staff essential workers.

Online threads started young, healthy people sharing contact info could run errands elderly neighbors peak. People organized online trade puzzles, games hobby activities.

Local businesses brought tons meals hospitals. would wager nurses didn’t pay meal til summer 2020.

Community fridges pantries popped around Brooklyn. Restaurants, grocery stores regular people brought extra food help others. Volunteering local food pantry high, get waitlist. 

I know terrible people exist. know bad stories pandemic. still believe humanity. still masses people helpful, kind caring. dumb.

the virus never completely go away.  know, think I'm gonna stop following sub rate I've now. dropping quality, think relatively safe say point, we're track get pandemic. think I'm gonna wait last month two get vaccinated, check sub sporadically see major changes happened Office worker required go every day left NY year.

Trust me, I'd love freaking get vaccine, I'm able to... soon can. then, take boss. People unable vaccinated getting lumped unwilling.

""What people genuine beliefs future this? asked belief. believe gonna become pandemic within year, first local epidemics outside Chine 1-2 months. One third population infected 1-2% die within 2-3 years. assume worst proven othervice.""

What learned past year?

That i'm good guessing. lot science pandemics nature humans crisis situation. No, many locations, US. Find let know. 

I appointment Wednesday, I'll ask well. 😂   Remember “Georgia’s Experiment Human Sacrifice”? lot less concerned unvaccinated people I've vaccinated.

I already covid. I'm safe around someone who's vaccinated. 

There's research indicate vaccine immunity effective naturally developed.

And since vaccine shown worse side effects already covid - get it?

Why go there's demonstrable benefit? 

I'm genuinely asking. support this. LPN, go back school get degree become RN. bridge programs facilitate that. RN’s know start LPN’s, though. Yes, diseases run risks lmao South Africa turned back shipments vaccine. Guess need go someplace.  three doctors family want wait get vaccine. want long term data. That's conspiracy theory. need stop treating people like nutjobs questions. Yes, idiots think Bill Gates trying poison everyone, also intelligent people apprehensive trusting certain pharmaceutical companies. Make fire you. Don’t quit. apologize - wrong! remember reading package insert birth control pills younger. freaking book filled warnings. Blood clots pulmonary embolism - two risks stayed while. eventually decided quit them, damn. I’ve never seen longer instert package since then. Yeah remote work smaller companies limiting due tax reasons i'll curious continues. hopefully least get one year people staying home (when possible) sick. 

i hope least occasional mask wearing common enough people social anxieties feel comfortable continuing wear well hospital administration would weeding people refusing get vaccinated. think would want staff member believe science taught college. Idk anyone work medical field decide chances getting covid better vaccine? sorry. would like boss telling Anti Virus software work, need firewalls Oh know Keurig generally sucks creating waste wish people aware reusable cups. stopped using altogether result waste discovered reusable cups.

The coffee make reusable cups also tastes much better whatever piddly amount ingredients put disposable cups, reusable cups make Keurig much worth allowing make better coffee, create less waste, make cup coffee 15x cheap made disposable cup.

If pick particular method making coffee like best, I’d say using French press. I’m much “roll bed 7 minutes need leave” type person, able simply push button, go brush teeth, come back (imo) decent cup coffee works best me.

If wake early actually try sit cup coffee house instead drinking way work, get angry missing 10 minutes could spent bed haha. data reported something?

it seems like number instances low suggest issue?

I seen original source Italian soldiers given many doses given even one batch, likely coincidence fuckup whoever gave vaccine?

I'm assuming we've told, pausing vaccine seems odd. idiots can’t even deliver EU. went donate blood couple months ago made small chit chat nurse. speaking optimistically summer asked getting vaccine started loosening spouting anti-vaxxer shit felt dumb trying make chatter. Got obese nurse relative boat. Afraid side effects isn’t afraid real consequences twice weight be, virus people like her. give anecdotal example, believe job done effectively remote 75% time (other 25% requires work machinery) boss required site pandemic. Why? ""butts-in-seats"", even though I've proven rare times gotten work remotely I'm least productive even working remotely, boss knows this.

My boss managers given reason ""collaboration"", probably way people group seem able communicate effectively showing someone's face talk. example I'll send get email person show desk minutes later talk it. millennial grew communicating via email IM pisses off! Nice see reddit echochamber army comments another point views immediately deleted. long stand mine? fight ideas like arguments, censoring them...  What? would ship vaccines way US, fill vials? happens slack off. inb4 authoritarian responds “slippery slope fallacy” three magic words refute argument Good luck experimental mRNA vaccine Yeah. ""Obese"" defined BMI 30. Starting 25 literally leaves 3 michiganders. 25BMI starting point ""Overweight."" someone else’s heart disease isn’t going potentially kill anyone them. Didn’t EEOC already put something this? Companies responsible creating safe work environments, no? virus continues hop person person, mutations grow. unless enough vaccinated, chances virus mutating enough make vaccine reduced effectiveness even effectiveness higher.
And sure modify vaccine match time, new strain nasty fast....lots dead Oh lots LPN’s don’t go back school. It’s type nursing comes lot restrictions there’s much education involved. Usually see nursing homes long term care facilities, sometimes school nurses. I’m boat. going go Japan late March last year (my first time country) went away quickly :( wearing damn mask ever hope one else post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I saw somebody make exact argument use smart phone, clear tabs, activate private tab, Google title article want read, click said article, read article otherwise would paywalled reading. go DMV get it... pandemic...

If put shit online I'm sure enrollment would increase.

Also point real ID... There's reason passports exist. Obviously exceptions, getting vaccine don’t want plenty enough reason company decide don’t want work there. He’s literally attached Exley would support vaccination mandatory list schools kids allowed get it. Antinvaxxers homeschool. think makes better calls?

Governments East Asia. Almost everything learned COVID mitigation learned Chinese, South Korean, Singaporean sources.  Local hospitals getting vaccines December. first megasite state opened first week January. I'm sure much work done think reasonable think suddenly going reverse course unable least keep pace Biden taken office. That’s really interesting point. Would trump better pandemic never happened pandemic happens followed professional advice. can’t guess would play out. long time sub felt like felt far pessimistic side me.

Now feels like falls bit much optimistic side.

So, maybe moral story humans trouble moderating thoughts realistic middle ground approach. think many decided they're going optimistic things, want bad news bring down. completely understand them; find too. think part human nature look confirms beliefs throw away doesn't. something need better doing, I'm pretty sure internet rewards polarization extremes many cases would one last places happens. Lol support mandatory vaccines please go China. person take vaccine dystopian it’s scary. Trust this.

Why I? They're ones exposed threat I'm supposed take word theirs? waited 8 months real ID show mail, Minnesota’s got room improvement lol Right, never shut world it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, review data. would 100% fine king, honestly would agree. Morally principle, agree it. place legal system beyond private businesses government buildings discretion allow certain people reporting deaths hurt him, really pandemic taking Cuomo. That's risk, business whatsoever. weren’t absolutely toxic media irresponsible obsession top line numbers talking head doctors belong lab front camera, wouldn’t even topic. Serious question...not trying jerk can't things now? people seriously staying houses? really get got first shot yesterday (Pfizer), going believe get counted Saturday's count surpass 3 million. got rather lucky experience live. freaks social media stores. hope gets better ✌🏼 blanket mandate even people office need wear them.

Now wear blankets too? Man, gets worse worse Science doesn’t care feelings /s

But jokes aside, that’s fair makes sense. get overwhelming downright shitty people, included. personally try real myself, things good sooner expected, great! takes bit longer, that’s ok too. Whatever outcome, hope think worst behind us, that’s matters That's like saying bachelor's degree really 4 year degree people finish 2. Let's say masks saved 1% would otherwise gotten infected. That's 50,000 people. worth it? mean, mask, ball gag. dunno maybe wait least 50% going vaccinated first wave actually vaccinated. Instead opening baseball stadiums opening fucking day. teens vaccine late summer, children early next year trials go well. you’re looking little year everyone actually protected via vaccination. I’m saying can’t sliding scale things improve going full Texas right insane. 

And giving 14 year old lifelong breathing disorder handicap. Kinda crazy one 3? 4? people meet would hd shot. predictions final percentage uptake? case I'd like parachute please. Ahhh today’s “covid avoidance life” piece. 
Next up: instead giving blankets newborns boxes diapers soon parents, we’ll present boxes disposable masks. all. need intelligence necessary mental gymnastics.

The stupidest ideas come dumb people. come average average people using motivated reasoning. counter vector immunity. immune system recognises [e.g.] adenovirus vector first jab gets notably neutralised second jab thing. results second jab less effective unless wait immune system forget it, adenoviruses pretty quick hence 6-12 week recommended delay. 

mRNA vaccines suffer this. questions important decision making cases reported expected corresponding population unvaccinated ?

Seems , important question whether cases happened anything common respect existing conditions. do, might mean vaccine contra indicated certain conditions. saying statistically number cases worse general population misses point. articles I've seen make sound like ""green tier"" placeholder California reaches herd immunity. Obviously whether reach herd immunity another question. three years ago x-ray local hospital. x-ray tech wearing mask whole time asked why. started gushing didn’t believe vaccinations told Hospital’s response wear mask day work. I’m 100% certain lady turned anti-masker last year. exact mindset. wonder reconciled believing masks wearing mask 6 7 hours day previous two years. looking increasingly rare occur get data. Lol you’re good. 

Enjoy Matty V PxP guy *please* get Trout postseason .5% US population would 1.8 million dead people assuming nonintervention using “survival” statistic.

Stop pretending .5% meaningless number world 7.8 billion people living it. March 22nd May 10 8 weeks. 

8 million doses enough approximately 1/3 eligible Canadian population (first dose). Good news! lived world low wage worker negotiating parity boss. Maybe someday lol. Happy you’re enjoying working home though “For Phase 1 study ended cancelled, gained nothing gained nothing able generate data planned study,” said.

“It ended waste lot time parties.”

\------------------------

Anyway, even study went through, doubt Canada would import use China Vaccine. United States 51% voters opposite idea topic compared remaining 49%.

Imagine poll conducted 1'005 people (one thousand five people) representative American citizens think. Russian people skeptical vaccines general, they're choosing get vaccinated small numbers. That's impression. that's point. one's dictating anything here. Go hug anyone want, long consent hugee. hug police enforcing hug ban. said covid nothing worry about? Sorry organization credible british media comes AZ would assume ""green tier"" last step tier.

Ie: ""let's remove restrictions masking, see cases go up, relax remaining restrictions don't"" Well sucks. police shouldn’t stopping walk anyway.  Hey look Michigan letting everyone start getting shots April 5th. Like said. Ya messed up, reposted correct link. cant get vaccine area due Sulfa allergy. Hopefully help go work there's alternative people like me. Oh yeah! I’m 6’3 went 295 185 get it. totally feel way. feel like completely different person. I’ wouldn’t surprised people didn’t recognize me. couple months make this! can’t believe it’s year. simultaneously feels like eternity time passed me. Covid disrupted going back school different career (I can’t online classes). It’s also hell someone OCD, hell friends suffering depression feeling isolated. 90 y/o grandmother multiple health issues I’ve worried about, still waiting get vaccine. Literally right would’ve gotten it, got shingles wait gone get covid shot. can’t wait everyone vaccinated. I’m going fly see give big hug ASAP. getting rapid Covid test today ( fine, precaution) doctor giving test tells masks work take Vitamin instead. idiot, moron get school? lose license FDA approved. Please show guidance says allow employers require coronavirus vaccine current EUA state show clear violation rules meant protection human subjects medicine. Everything I've seen said vehicle accident deaths actually gone pandemic. everyone feels risk gets one don’t feel risk not, point restricting unvaccinated people going office?

There likely tens hundreds thousands people *cannot* vaccinated due preexisting medical condition. people allowed work without fear moron refused vaccinated killing them. 2 minutes mobile absolutely time interested knowing facts focused spreading disinformation. really need start paying attention world around you. Ya cut 1c state serious debate driving traffic way home. great day yesterday. California still slow vaccine count, sure catch up. entire point draw lines two different places. don’t think threat present walking around unvaccinated without mask bad things. saying. swam covid. 

After quarantine began ended exercising entire year depression. Yeah, let’s start idea order right thing paid. There’s way that’ll end badly. still choice get vaccinated not. don’t get travel, spread disease kill moaim people. stay tiny bubble let rest us enjoy freedom covid. Pretty simple choice. hasn’t turned slippery slope

And yet, conversation! Fucked US would give vaccines people instead first helping 3rd world countries first. Racist world live in. Well aspect refference different kind boundary. clear respond. soooo important healthy relationship disrespecting boundary serious offense, unless job requires oddball hours course, like call example. company work looking transition full part time WFH giving 150 person office smaller one in-person meetings temp offices people prefer work office. 

I think companies might make switch fulltime (or least part time).

I one hires last year never met single co-worker person. Canada delayed second dose, though? really mean 8 million Canadians measure protection. Honestly I'd prefer US that, too, kinda late. ""You're pre-approved (to drop $30.50 ID need want get domestic flight)!"" Ouch. kind accuracy hurts. world favor: put nice thick wool coat take dip deep lake. batch millions doses sent 17 EU countries. Fire grill stock weenies marshmallows. Good news. 7 14 averages hospitalisations bouncing around -2% 10% weeks, week daily hospitalisations exceeded 7 day average 5 7 days.

I think it’ll fall too, it’s quite stubborn knows. Florida open California lockdown, yet similar numbers. Dude wear stupid mask. Stop threatening people's lives College/University highlight life imagine aspect education stuck home zero social life. 

During degree, university early hours. Venturing lively city new friends experience nightlife. 

My ex-colleague currently second year medical degree. never stepped foot medical facility. depressing existence. genuinely terrifying say person supported shut downs. experimental medicine fucking came absolutely mandated. work pressuring us get honestly, caved, terrified. support science part science DATA. That's exactly would say planned track us via 5G nanoparticles vaccines!/s Better idea: stop restricting politicising vaccine. separate force restrictions people, people simply refuse take political stance.

Let people live lives make choices. people want negligent risk, that's problem. want safe get vaccinated, well.

More people willing get vaccine flu shots threatened something like that. Threatening restrictions Americans number 1 way make sure roughly half country stops listening opposite asked. think epidemiologist cautioning even though numbers look good declining, supply doses yet meet demand, especially we're opening slots many categories. indicating expansion indoor commercial activities well mixing households, accelerate spread eligible ppl chance get vaccinated. like putting cart horse. Illinois? Sounds like geriatric. yet heard country that's running list 18-65 unless health care special vulnerable group. nyc city state taxes take home 3400 month 73.5k year income. certainly crazy want realize situation. vaccines worth weight gold. country use political advantage will.

If Canada really wants vaccines they'll open dairy industry US (or trade agreement). That's reality world. America business world police going step world doctor. free. I'd worried spider living ear COVID that's symptom tbh joke Marlins park planning opening like 25% capacity people like “They’re planning increase attendance?!” course not. Developing boosters absolutely right thing do. 

However, evolutionary pressure balanced fact that, transmission first place, mutation thus evolution guided pressure.

We data yet say respond six months year - preparing possible outcomes, also means committing particular vaccine strategy unless clinical epidemiological benefits. know Denmark, current Swedish prognose: (which recently adjusted accomodate less doses)

As reference, Sweden 10M inhabitants private company impose terms likes employees. Employees accept them, employer tell person must work home fire them.  fail? Sure, lot sensationalist articles craigslist ads, heard single story people actually using those.

On February 11 (when policy implemented), Massachusetts middle pack came vaccine distribution. today, rank 8th doses per capita people using policy friends/relatives elderly (including elderly people quite 75+ age bracket) 

I'm glad Jacksonville using system, I'd like see expanded nationwide. many vulnerable lack means travel vaccination sites easily. creative solution seems produced real results Massachusetts. They're 100% safe, they're lot safer infection!

Just look daily threads January. Every day least one person asking long takes get sense smell back. dieing, probably ""severe"" symptoms (they're posting), heck mostly recovered. sense desperate able smell taste again.

I'd much rather bad days bed lose sense smell months. never fully recovers.

The point is, severe disease make much worse vaccine.

And right vaccinating people recovered, least two recent studies indicate people likely need one dose mRNA vaccine get immunity comparable two jabs. locations set East Jerusalem. Arabs showing high  It’s anti vaccine one.

Vaccines take 4-10 years develop.
This shit made 8 months!!!???

Sorry, don’t want test dummie long term side effects.

I literally moved across country job two months ago, it’s really great job like lot.

But require get vaccine fire I’ll quit.

There’s possible way understand long term side effects thing already.

I’m logical. read long hard vaccine development came conclusion.

Maybe five ten years. understanding vaccines produced help Defense Production Act legally forced stay US. Biden could override that, administration likely hedging bets goal post set every adult eligible May 1st.

If something slow Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J production, Biden letting doses go would terrible optics. Good see Sanofi's RNA vaccine progressing. arrive late 2021, may bij een useful 2022 beyond. would also redeem France's Pharma pride. Fauci literally caused global pandemic! /s free market ideals gave us American healthcare system. 

I don’t want pay play pandemic. matter? can't get rid AZ fucked approval started telling everyone work anyone age 65. one wants it.

Even so, AZ chose EU screw they're seen diplomatic push over. imagine US getting news getting 75% less vaccines. would hell pay. AZ accurately pegged Brussels bunch wimpy suits would fire angry Tweets, shafted instead even thinking touching US UK's supply. vaccine killed .03 people took it, one would take it, organization would approve it.

I honestly can't tell trying make point not. Lives need saved first worry mental health later. need stay lockdown completely eradicate virus. all. vaccine requirements many workplaces, primarily medical fields. However context vaccinations every work place even access restaurant. It’s way complex trying make be. 

I’m getting shot(s). Germany getting started third wave. Mass vaccination even begin Depends what's contract. US government carefully worded get priority what's made US. time, countries seem care US typically leader vaccine production one largest populations world, seen way decrease burden factories.

However, one things US government right pour money vaccine production raw supplies vaccines, production much higher anticipated. produce high rates mean US capable it. shortage labor materials so.

I would surprised see increased vaccine manufacturing overall US this, even non covid illnesses. extremely useful infrastructure place. Well there's always Bill Gates microchip backup [/sarcasm] would known hasn’t long term study? Well, guess get test efficacy one-dose vaccine real life example. Went wedding yesterday pretense fully masked times except eating drinking, outside. Ended raining dinner, everything moved inside masking pretty hit miss. didn’t stay long mostly stayed corner spouse close friend fully vaccinated. I’m days short 2nd Moderna shot, know least protection. Hoping one covid did, didn’t get :/ cases approaching low points last year seem pretty aggressive vaccinations. haven’t checked numbers, sites vaccinating 18+ medical conditions - proof required. 

I know hot spot long time totally reopened May, I’m liking way things going. Besides, aren’t vaccines helpful variants too?  you’re claiming Canada tell AZ doses come from? Even though AZ saying doses Canada come India? 

Once again, contract (not shitty tabloid source) say AZ produce vaccines destined Canada US? wrote 150 words practice racist literally reason then, cool. kind astonishing employers us carry working getting much work done normal year everyone's mental health state I'm sure is. 

Like I'm lucky, company super flexible us, we've WFH beginning, let us know we're great reach need help, work still piled per usual. surprising idk. Team ScienceTM Evil Science Denier?

It's amazing say straight face. guys even listen anymore? IKR... were, say, 75-90% survival rate MAYBE would roll dice experimental ""vaccine,"" 99.7%? certifiable lmao!! must either living Alaska, working profession eligible already. Amazing everyone vaccinated save one guy. wear rubber times, necessity. Yep, every one friends searched vaccine able find get one already Nearly million people year get blood clots US. 30 people gotten 5 million vaccine doses delivered - maths.  shoot load tomorrow literally JAQ'ing off: Asking Questions. Loaded leaning question, defense ""it question!"" response. started going therapy beginning pandemic. ive going every week basically talking Covid related issues. honestly really helped get through. Congratulations Pfizer, biontech, moderna, JNJ Janssen’s scientists outstanding achievement well America it’s vaccine administrators/distributors getting right delays. Keep going Oh *now* he's worried mental health? Fuck asshole. COVID 99% survival rate. city obligation renew business licenses. Administered:

101,128,005 Doses - March 12th  
Doses administered last 24 hours - 2,924,112 New Record! abortion terrible invasive experience one excited go through, bit naive say people use birth control. 

People abortions wide variety reasons. includes pregnancies medically unsafe child mother. could also due unwanted pregnancy rape birth control failing.

My hunch coming religious standpoint, fine. free believe higher power take comfort that. However, trying force beliefs someone decision absolutely effect productive modern society. Denying someone choice abortion potential ruin multiple lives based desire offended. Sputnik deemed cut corners irresponsibly skipped important parts testing process. Pfizer vaccine came weeks later.

It impossible pretend geopolitics commercial interests point. What's role University? heard anything similar University. they’re related you’re making vaguely comparable points distract attention issue. Sure, obesity issue again, that’s sole choice. eating burger affects me. Sure could get healthcare costs taxes, whatever, fact brand new disease instantly killed many people almost heart disease yearly. That’s cause concern attention? We’re supposed live that?

As two weeks flatten curve means, could equally well submit meant ""two weeks we'll see we're at"" which, turned out, good place. definitely concede public health officials lost lot credibility sufficiently upfront citizenry (especially regarding masks, which, I'm sure we'll find road, preserve mask supply chains hospitals). concede follows that, mistakes, ""I justified whatever now"", attitude sensing OC. erred imputing attitude OC, apologize. simply commenting broadly held position ""what they've told us changed much, therefore must wrong"". incredibly novel situation everyone. Recommendations change essentially one-to-one correspondence best science says. Buy electric kettle french press office (be home otherwise). almost guaranteed save money. Buy decent one buy anything twice. want people get vaccinated, mandate it.

Requiring vaccines works school children. People offended questions matter word it. isn’t first rodeo People color far skeptical vaccine white people. proposed vaccination requirements would disproportionately affect PoC, becoming another example institutional racism. personally, I'm pretty sure social distancing masks - I've taking restrictions seriously. think masks, course, think masks block transmission. saves even single miserable cold, I'm it. Great. Different factories. US, AZ partnered Emergent BioSolutions manufacture vaccine perhaps capacities higher AZ Europe. Emergent BioSolutions pretty shady company way, knows what's going really. Yes, least right now. much U.S., finding appointment still really tough, especially older people tech-savvy. average 64-year-old needs vaccine much, much do. I’m 18 got email university get vaccinated since I’m school employee! Im excited COVID ruined life ways count, really want over. really hate vaccines always huge fear shots needles.

For people already vaccinated, especially people hate shots, experience? feel getting vaccine? want prepared :) sign already? last stage negotiations went well. Maybe negotiating doses doses faster idk [Well, pre-reqs make 6 months (prior Military experience EMT), still 6 month program.


[Here's another 6 month program seems pre-requisites dare exercise free will, come opinions have, quickly like!

Even 100% right time, try self-righteous might able get place her. established trust her, truth issue, must presentation. Saturday’s always biggest amounts.  number issues here. problem one addressing them.

Not government,  Pfizer, take vaccine else punished.

Well plays right hands conspiracy people. think that, assuming trajectory we’re holds, sort exception going forward we’ll need boosters less less frequently virus suppressed thus mutates less less. maybe get booster within year first, another year every years something. could end yearly akin flu shots.

Obviously speculating, a) won’t surprised it’s recommended everyone get booster end 2021 (as article seems indicate), b) also surprised that’s last time happens frequency. legal restrictions can't happen one vaccines FDA licensed, right? us patiently awaiting time get may end one licensed anyway. I’m allowed drive could inadvertently kill March Maddness entirely Indiana year, basketball crazy state. would packed without doubt Exactly.

You head r/enlightenedcentrism bet love it.

Seriously though, good luck life! I'm OP reason back said me, right? Boosters maybe getting efforts finish vaccinating world.

I'm happy sorts vaccine options future. anyone denying fact soft country?

Also, Plinkett reference? Nice ad hominem. can't argue facts, guess always throw names around. Yeah. people weren’t vaccine amiright 😂 Sadly, due utter luck unprofessionalism AstraZeneca (possibly) Johnson &amp; Johnson, I've moved ""summer love"" expectations ""halloween sex whiskey"" occurred someone's choice potential inadvertently kill someone else maybe need look bit differently? True J&amp;J well. 72% effective US translates 99% chance catch basically 100% chance hospital.

If get vaccine wind sick bed week, incredibly unlucky. Go buy lottery ticket see there's balance world. Pre-COVID acknowledged ""sick bed week"" distinct, normal risk life.

We blinked twice COVID started dangerous SA variant someone literally vaccine. cautious along. 

Ok CDC releases guidelines saying thing now, July 4th date mute. basically he’s contradicting CDC. U.K. received AZ doses brewed EU. EU report showed they’ve exported 9m doses U.K., U.K. jabbed 9 million arms Pfizer get EU.  sure long ago went school, every incident bullying turned Federal case even long ago 2008-2010 so. Thank much kinds words ❤️ Terrifying true tbh Literally forgot got himself, OK. They're going approved like literally next month ... I'd also think hundreds millions doses given would large enough capture particular sub-set might erroneous reactions.  dreaded Covid-16.  possible way long term side effects known.

By logic, company able mandate use new technology.

I demand employer provide landline long-term effects 5g unknown!

I demand employer provide bottled water long-term effects bottle filling station water unknown!

I demand employer allow incandescent lighting cubicle long-term effects LED fixtures unknown!

The truth time luxury pandemic. Αnd think, Trump distribution plan. significant number Americans see importance lives men, women, children nations targeted American aggression.

That's true. also true significant number Americans care great deal. complex issue, certainly complex painting it.

Even side hawks complex that. see radicalized Islamic fundamentalism evil world. can't blame that; would hope Muslims probably either. easily argued way they're trying fight evil makes things worse, different type evil.

But believe stated motives genuine, really trying help.

Take +1 though, see reason comment deserves downvoted even disagree parts it. right sovereignty body. right privacy medical background. right treated equal, regardless medical condition. right knowingly infect others. So, case, I'd like vaccinate, want forced it, want tell anyone else order protect equality others want vaccinated. lot - saying vaccinated person worried unvaccinated people, especially since current messaging vaccinated unvaccinated spread same. Unvaccinated people always going there, there's always going level Covid risk going forward.

My point vaccinated Covid risk likely lower average person's Covid flu risk (even flu vaccinated), that's obviously different everyone, person needs make decisions. Yes, could hold ups process. Acting like everything perfectly go plan never need backup piss poor leaders act. He's trying carefully tread line underselling moving quick. People antsy get back normal think safe go back soon may end lock harder again. really share data information better. Since covid vaccine type flu shot, pregnant women safely take flu shot, risk low. thalidomide. Yes, doesn’t mean want take extra risk allowing unvaccinated people plane. much less risk allowing vaccinated people obvious reasons ""directing"" states kind fucking pointless, it? Ignoring fact zero authority that. Like 7 countries associated two well. plan censor governments well? completely honest, US never really locked down. could technically still leave house etc quite while. 

Not trying compare, country one longest time without person school. 24 hour lockdowns left would sent jail. Days divided male female ( F- M, W F) (Male - T, T) could leave certain 2 hours groceries depending last digit ID (Cops stopped every district make sure it’s hour). Weekends completely locked went you’d sent jail night few.

This went March way August. grueling disgusting thing I’ve ever felt life. complete freedom stripped away months. couldn’t leave house walk dog go run.

There still lasting remnants this. I’d profiled stopped neighborhood reason cops everywhere now. 

I wish could turn clock back live 2019 forever. somehow assume ""essential worker"" mechanic mass transit, we'll still last party taken care of. Cool. Procurement Minister Anita Anand said advance purchase agreement government AstraZeneca “has doses coming United States.” **She specified press conference doses arrive second third quarter year, facility approved Health still application full approval adults? If* approved. still valid argument too. anything vaccine FDA approved dangerous covid, atleast healthy people age group. seems ""Americans support..."" means ""this people want likely happen unless there's quantifiable outrage"" I'm... need get reddit everytime delete I'm afraid I'm going miss something major news end blind sided.. *heavy ass sigh* must admit, way going comment, say looked today, unless there's crucial detail missing, I'm tempted agree 'Ukraine' 'the [[BBC [[Reuters boop I’m bot) What’s source 95% number? There’s nothing speed time friend. won’t know long term side effects long term.

And anyone worried won’t get vaccine justified. Unfortunately me, whole thing quote, take credit competent cutting pasting. like rule would ever put place anyways since vaccines widely available.  Well, Sir, end January, nobody approved AZ vaccine yet except UK, would exports gone opinion? Vietnam Ukraine, I'm sure Soriot would keen mention that.

It took 2 seconds find this. watching 36:06 agree underpromised overdelivered Good luck!! goal set took office.. heard family people lending money fucking mob employer coerce people way around, i.e. get vaccinated? it’s yay 4th wave...I’ll tell 1920 wouldn’t spreading case spreading people chosen risk? 50-70 days still pretty high risks though (at least lot higher risk compared low risk tolerance). absolute best-case scenario, 20% still unvaccinated point (16 unders), actually substantially that. article we're commenting says 27% indicated interested getting vaccinated. Even continues drop next 50-70 days, let's say 10-20%, we're still looking like 30-40% population vaccinated. even 70 days, OP may still likely pass virus many people, that's really going change while.

However, change (and already changing) people susceptible contracting virus (mostly) low risk severe symptoms (children) accepted consequences actions (those refusing vaccine). sorry, trust Danes Norwegians proven liars, British. sorts rules employers impose employees. take look employee manual want examples. Employers permitted create rules violation laws (e.g. murder anti-discrimination laws examples). laws protecting individuals chose get vaccinated. one arguing made actual point supported evidence. “Programming”? Yeah go back r/conservative. Got first Moderna jab last night! arm pretty sore, symptoms. wild March 11th, 2020 virus officially declared pandemic one year later day highly effective vaccine arm. Huge props brilliant scientists made happen. Thanks. started completely different direction. Im overwhelmed behind schedule. part wants write core. wait life gets little ""normal"" think. studies wish see well. Damn guys paranoid beyond belief. body choice experimental emergency authorized vaccines lmao. 99.7% survival rate lets force vaccinate people....nah chance backfires all. Unless... even get hepatitis shot server job college. sent quoted mom. Hopefully changes mind getting vaccine, doubt it. generation take give. they’ve always been. Reddit really helping visit sub often. There's way much belittlement in-person interaction. Define ""earmarked"". Fact is, vaccines produced EU exported (such shipment headed Australia) large scale. also going hard people grieving lost loved ones, still coping mental trauma damaged health. Sure, I’m talking living people exist now. live Florida. large number people aggressively interested helping others.

I want shots arms, cultural revolution. think selfish people motivated incentives benefit personally like cash payments, movie tickets, Amazon gift cards, whatever. 

If sugar doesn’t work, maybe negative pressure starts. Make pay virus testing. can’t pay, well, find another job get free shot. them. 🤷‍♀️

Berating people won’t work, though. Trust me. I’ve living Florida idiots years... Lord Fauci wouldn’t agree say get vaccine go live life. That’s everyone know real world doing. got second shot like month ago bars etc 2 weeks. don’t even wear mask gym anymore. don’t really interact old people parents, also already vaccinated (along pretty much every old person know). year taught anything trust public official throws arbitrary date make people feel better summer gonna like roaring 20's! People gonna go get cray cray. People care. see vaccine rate increasing, cases plummeting, want care anymore. blame degree, pandemic taught many people plain soft cannot deal told wear masks responsibly distance. They're capable caring longer. like third world country now

30-40% youth unemployment even prior covid? friend, always 🔫 Nobody forced get vaccine. don’t opinion shouldn’t allowed planes cruise ships risk spreading it. always drive take vacation somewhere else vacation know works USA live (Italy) would love get vaccine realistically take much time get shot cannot force everything nation behind schedule...

I mean can, shitty country hope happen things take granted said everything thinking eloquently! Human rights many things lumped politics. Getting vaccine considered right politicized death. Years clinical data vaccine safety destroyed facts logic. wasn’t. pitiful. Holy shit! Taking family get vaccinated going family affair. Hahaha What? That's Italy (with EU's cooperation) EU received flak it.

I agree vaccine exports banned entirely. Vaccines aren’t candy, medically necessary public health. They’re meant sustain something called “herd immunity” provides communities enough vaccined individuals disease either eradicated diminished. Think polio one leading causes childhood disability one year year vaccine it’s even scale. Today polio largely even western disease thats common. 

A certain percentage population needs vaccinated protect individuals can’t get stop disease making new strains. people unvaccinated, disease mutates easier strains come faster. 1 year without covid vaccine resulted 2 strains emerging. 

Children cancer people protected vaccines. Elderly shingles people you’re protecting vaccines. Veterans victims agent orange people you’re protecting vaccines. aren’t protected unless certain percentage population gets vaccine. make sense? Americans unprincipled scum true. Everyone take one vaccines, one forced coerced taking vaccines. guess you’re suppose ask questions regarding science..

Thanks respectful answer never caught fat fuck coworker. I'm much concerned government denying people's right association movement month seizing corporate assets. seizing corporate assets means people safely get freedoms back month early government it. already get CDC Vaccination card get vaccinated. doesn’t laminated photo ID, vaccine info, name DoB. Depends. think there’s less controversy isn’t gov mandate pandemic, force wear mask. common courtesy like walk right side street. there’s pattern harassment assault someone wearing masks, karens company, might scare people so. Restrict harder daddy Okay, know purposefully getting we're done. They're literally sending millions people $1,400 deposits three days authorized so, want sit still pretend 80s era ""government friend""?

Update priors, shit's changed. Government back, baby. I've worked home years, wife's office less 10 minute walk. We've stayed exactly reason. idea space yard sound attractive add commute it. “new technology”... earth wouldn’t anyone want ask questions? earth downvoted asking question?

Things make go “hmmm” Why? vaccine works, even people around unvaccinated. literally none business people bodies. CA you? polled, think need make people take RNA editing vaccine stay home, want sneeze infect new DNA human edited RNA?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lmao guys brainwashed...no hope yall I'm actually pretty lucky, PTS bad manageable medical compression sleeve; sounds much traumatic bro, alright end? I’ve conversation many times, it. say “I’m high risk Covid pre-existing condition could likely negatively effected vaccine.” people satisfied that. anyone ever asks “what condition” I’ll like “it’s private” ya know I’m tired explaining too. 😂  Unlikely ever pass court law. One thing think ton people sleeping whole ""teams productive home, employers see offices stop existing"". think that's pretty short-sighted. would argue one huge reason productivity stayed relatively high full WFH teams coworkers colleagues already pre-existing relationships built years office. think it'd different story 3 years nobody ever met half people work every day. Excess death graphs turn people around. ""If want live fear go ahead."" -is afraid vaccine Bear mind also SARS-CoV-2 never going spreading among totally immunonaïve population again

You assuming this: ""a totally immunonaïve population"".  hundreds thousands people US refuse get vaccinated, people vaccinated catch COVID variant period time.   would surprised anywhere close ineffective 1.5 years  

And yet scientific source this. belief, unless provide source. different hearing experts vaccines.  

Clearly disagree science - OK.   

____________________________________   

I think unless people getting vaccinated within two years, see resurgence COVID US. Globally, COVID still rampant - Americans travelling lot. Many large countries plans currently vaccinate population (the Philippines Indonesia, two examples).    

We already huge numbers people planning stop wearing masks gather large groups summer US. see spike deaths infections summer, many people refuse get vaccine. diseases get vaccines colleges schools deadly diseases kill children.

....No. criteria needing vaccination ""it kills children"". know sake terrible argument need pretend that's is, know care that. Yep really sad people passed away virus. can, still Emergency Use Authorization expected lock people tell anti socially distance one another Honest answer - easy target shift blame to. already collective built mistrust dislike UK Brexit. CA’s recent bad vaccine numbers keep up, probably won’t hit 60% May 1st. hope I’m wrong though. I'm gonna lie, concern loss smell disappeared got infected. come back little month (thankfully). 


Overall, like vast majority people got infected (and that's LOT people), little problems kicking it. 


While think vaccination useful cases, vaccinating children, young adults healthy people antibodies, huge waste money. 
The risk severe covid small groups people. 


Again, cannot make claim vaccines long term data. risk assessment thing evaluate yourself. hard make balance without (or little) long term data. making claims sit well me; think important always think critically. 


About previously infected people needing one shot: might even need first one strong antibody response right gate. There's data suggesting vaccinating people useful aside ""just safe"". think good reason considering little know virus vaccines. Also, expensive. issue really people can’t get vaccinated. hope enough reach heard immunity Americans lost many privileges result pandemic

Americans lost many rights result people taking advantage pandemic. FTFY Turns out, get choose live life. feel comfortable (through vaccination, post covid immunity, low risk group) gathering, means do. 

I tell people ain't waiting July. government ordered mask mandate state area hardly ever saw anyone without mask store. Like count one hand many people saw last 9 months. Went Walmart yesterday would say 40% people without masks. slower time crowded amazed. people vaccinated, may follow guidelines short eventually they'll done. Supply unlikely issue, appointments limited. state expecting take 5 months get 70% vaccinated open appointments demographics assuming every appointment filled every facility.

If developing distributing vaccine hard, logistics administering hundreds millions people legit nightmare. Tissues thing. take mask sneeze one. don’t believe Trudeau lying ministers, yes. 

What official communication AstraZeneca clearly saying doses aren’t coming US India? I'm sorry, I'm world expert drug administration acronyms. number ~200 countries around world could use FDA acronym body analyzes vaccines, ""emergency use authorization"" universal acronym English speaking countries. Wow, much bad info. almost impressive. Please take conspiracy theories elsewhere. Bye. evidenced fact job wait July get PTO illness. ""won't be"", be, penalized taking time off. Business whatever want, govts allowing it, take longer us get vaccinated. middle aged person asthma copd, I'd eat shit vaccine dont worried damn time getting sick anymore. stressful year. avg, believe that’s insurance go site covid testing place one point company tested monthly basis cheap. One America upset Trump credited creating vaccine. watch FIL does. Obsessively.  Ah yes, official communications Minister charge = ""Trudeau's talking points"" 
Just believe it, mean true. leftover dose several people photo asked got one. beyond excited live area people iffy vaccines, especially co-workers. people see safe afterwards, likely get it. see post gloating, saw celebrating science parts humanity worth fighting for. open availability vs actually getting appts get vaccinated two different things though parents next weekend!! mom even planning slumber party! YAY! opinion yes. Especially downside getting vax people literally zero Hey man, hang there, buddy. idea from. want miss fun shit ends. almost there! sure fine. want someone talk to, DM me. Existing without covid vaccine neither threatening negligent. pretty warped idea self-granted right control other’s inject inject themselves. vaccine? ""You"" keep putting quotes. I'm sure ""you"" real objections it, baseless fear. Omg, want cry! That's normal comment found post! idea people can't see nose... nobody concerned even second thoughts long term side effects.. Well, there’s every person come across wearing mask Mandatory flu shots already exist. hospital system requires every employee get flu shot. refuse, terminated.

Also, mandatory HPV vaccines would great. Australia mandated HPV vaccines nearly eradicated cervical cancer. yea lockdowns really crush huh. big joke wonder necessary given low death rate everyone 60 almost nothing fear virus. isolated elderly vulnerable, masked up, went lives. Brilliant. post something tell ""read yourself"", proves wrong never read themselves. occured milk sour inside # “news” article written paid stock bashers

Reuters, CNBC, MarketWatch, ... list long. articles paid Wall Street

join r/GME learn truth

(there’s also fair chance take home $508,790 per share)

EDIT: paid stock bashers likely downvote cause don’t want know Would matter P1? mountain evidence already exists. Getting vaccinated protect yourself, family, friends no-brainer. get Astra Zeneca batch 2856? didnt happen homey. resourcing that. what’s worth look JNJ shot. uses technique used tk make flu shot. Long term risks known Benefits someone 60 MRNA. 

They also ha e sub Reddit read people’s reactions JNJ. wife got cause iffy MRNA write research paper subject grad school. waited JNJ cause researched thought less risky her. remember, general population lazy ignorant.

Most people won’t take time look vaccine development see rate one developed ridiculous side effects won’t see years favor EU blocking exports US UK, country produce vaccine citizens export EU. likely keep exporting countries production facilities, countries import vaccines from. Yeah this. worry people might get discourage go sign May 1st appointments booked two three months, that's reality it. logistics nightmare many people places administer vaccine.

For perspective, state already plans make vaccine available demographics April 1st, even though enough doses available us, we're expecting 70% vaccination August September. Nope. link doesn’t provide clear reference contract Canada AZ is, fact, regurgitation Trudeau’s talking points. 

In fact, AZ doesn’t even facilities US forced partner local producer produce doses US. Emergent BioSolutions produces AZ vaccines latter incapable US. 

Let’s see contract. sure country Right, certain point people need risk assessment. They're 90% effective virus that's certainly less 1% IFR (CDC data pegged around 0.3%). know everyone encourages everyone get flu vaccines people running around office without it, generally much less effective (50% 0.1% IFR virus). 

In almost likelihood, Covid vaccinated danger flu (0.3%/10 vs. 0.1%/2).

And speaks nothing age stratification 30, probably risk flu anyway.  reduces chances, reduce enough dispense mandatory vaccines son daughter’s workplace? That’s understand reasoning. US way past worse. want mask social distance till 2022 guess. restrictions dropped Memorial Day can't force someone take experimental drug condition benefit.

No one forcing cant force share office space unvaccinated person either. Worked great apparently course 'open completely every adult vaccinated' strategy assuming Covid actually harm children. bit gamble, given children futures?? ...Sad good time buy big pharma March 2020. saying it’s bad investment now, you’ve already missed train bit. Unless 120, majority teachers, hyperactive immune system, expected response vaccine fever induced immune response. It’ll induce immune response, form minor body aches. It’s rare, usually seen hyperactive immune systems, immune response high fever makes people call work. Nice try though. know nothing biology, vaccine design, immune system. Depends degree. Admittance medical school (to get MD DO) pretty much impossible unless decently intelligent.

The rest healthcare varies like profession. genius janitors idiot nurses everything between.  literally see AstraZeneca jab could cause blood clot. It’s physiologically possible opinion. part decent walk, I'll admit miss.

The thing miss commuting (which I'm easily willing accept benefits) dedicated time listen podcasts etc. miss traveling definitely kind miss time knew would always use things like that. JJ one current FDA approved vaccines went SA variant trials, fared well. South Africa moved away AZ going towards JJ Pfizer. Promises made promises kept! numbers keep growing. truly rounding corner! fuck don’t. never knew anti vax moment

edit need /s I’m downvoted hell said hoped people wouldn't, people choice different production sites. like UK India seem managing production, possible US site major issues. Yeah, exactly. wish suffering European friends, boy Europeans act superior government dropping ball... must embarrassing them. friend got serious offers US hospitals (from Canada) took additional training work cardiac ICU.

You’re probably right Yeah Mr. White! People make stupid posts Reddit without thinking things through. benefits birth control outweigh risks people. don’t fucking smoke take BC. Housing costs 2-3x much. Cuomo CDC started including J+J yet? Nucleotides building blocks DNA RNA- ""raw mRNA"". Every use find term ""raw mRNA"" reference naked mRNA float around.

Right, perhaps “raw RNA” wrong verbiage. concern nucleotides, RNA. Good obviously learned nothing time?


I say saying Pfizer Moderna stuck component knew could toxic vaccine hoped best? honestly- that's pretty laughable

No! saying may fully know effects LNPs since they’re kind hard study Setting aside LNP toxicity monitored for

Could provide source this? would like see proof monitor well understanding best starting point give would touches various LNPs, similarity existing approved LNPs, cites variety studies safety specific vaccines.

You said studies specifically LNPs Pfizer Moderna used. reading paper see that. “Similarity” doesn’t cut it, since similar LNPs also huge issues. Although, thirty page paper, perhaps missed it. Could direct precisely paper cites another paper studied safety toxicity specific LNPs used vaccines? That's work. feel like closely related 75 million people voted man waged war CDC OP....but always feel sorry human life gets stabbed. can't help it. do. find very, wrong...nothing religion outside feel deep gut. Wish didn't, tbh. Welcome American politics Roughly 24% America 18. Maybe 20% 16 (can't find number).

30% American adults say never take vaccine, that's another 23% country.

So least 43% country either cannot never take vaccine.

There almost certainly another surge. care, virtually everyone dies die declined vaccine. mixing Chinese coronavirus testing vaccines. LOL Facilities guy here, broached subject said ""why force wear gloves instead"" sent email saying ""if wear gloves using coffee I'll forced remove it""

Everyone uses gloves. No, live NY, right work state, means, employer fire reason discrimination unfortunately, that’s extremely difficult prove. damn, conspiracy theorists right theory, maybe hard part done federal level.

The air travel industry already working thing called [IATA Travel Pass [asking CDC's Air travel stuff regulated federally anyway saw Biden issued [national mask mandate air manage get happen (which seems possible -- helps airlines' business), they've got system place everybody else (states, etc.) re-invent could piggyback of. **don't right** endanger around you. British Same.

I wish people took seriously start. risk reinfection new people studied cornaviruses knew immunity often lasted wouldve nice actively monitoring relapses/potential reinfectioms get-go.

Boy.

Wouldnt data helpful...

Hope best plan worst sound strategy... plan worst part bit downer lets keep hope part. Current guidance vaccinated people spend time unvaccinated people unmasked, indoors unvaccinated person/people low risk severe complications. Millions lives lost could easily cut half less everyone sucked fuck wore mask stayed home while

Citation seriously needed. textbook states California (high compliance, strict lockdowns) Florida (low compliance, light/no lockdowns) less 10% difference deaths per capita. Florida much densely populated older population. Unless population willing endure serious lockdown (e.g. China/Australia/NZ) vaccine ready, lockdowns/masks slow spread degree, total number infected/dead ends same. Yeah, science! point, they're probably better leaving state governments clerical/administrative processing. get data wants shot move without partisan state legislatures weirdo governors hundreds doses go waste every day.  wrong poor messaging- legitimately different circumstances. 

We means bring end Pandemic America via Vaccine longer dealing relatively unknown virus. 

The issue longer small actions lead infections prevent return normalcy. matter fast produce vaccine doses administer them. Shit still go wrong process tangible measurable problem fixed versus thousands small actions every day lead virus transmission. Yep first time dealing hyperpartisan hacks. I’m wasting time Sounds like you’re going something I’m field agree well. Way many anti vaccine nurses days don’t know they’re still licensed. get political hasn’t really done anything “completely turn around” vaccine gonna get distributed either way, federal mask mandate really affected niche situations, leadership CDC hasn’t really promoted vaccine “return normal” tool, insane. much work done equally well remotely I'm sure better environment less people commute. Also businesses would rent less offices US’s success come countries expense? three approved vaccines American companies. funded combination government US company money.

We’ve transparent beginning going vaccinate populous first. It’s like airplane instruct put oxygen mask assisting others. 19 year head start SARS-COV-1 MERS research. AI incredible advancement super computing power... SARS-COV-2 virus sequenced three day protein modeling software gave possible solutions spike protein structure 4 days! shortcuts safety trials... time saved theoretical design vaccine.

Dude, really know you’re talking about. news around rate vaccinating get herd immunity, still 30% population saying think get vaccine herd immunity thought around 70-85% that's incredibly slim margins bottom range. sure capacity hit herd immunity then, need keep moving group towards getting vaccine. least showing positive trend right now, hopefully continues, that's still consider big assumption. Also unfortunately likely clustering anti-vax folks evenly spread could cause weird pockets virus possibly thrive in. Yeah, 15 here. worst year life.

The one good thing say, though, worst year life probably behind now. could walk next room magically office I'd nothing every day, holy shit never *really* understood much life wasting sitting bus. I’m 22. graduated college last year economy mess aren’t many job opportunities, coupled parents backwards logic stay home much possible don’t give accidentally give relatives Covid visit mask-less expert’s orders. Awww little special guy scared getting shot? It’s ok I’m sure find somebody hold hand it. 

You anti vaxxers look pathetic point politician heart. admitted lying multiple issues. He's huckster.

The last thing Fauci said truthfully honest stating masks likely make much difference sick medical professionals wear masks. state workers apply everyone including private companies need write book man. good writing fictional tales. mean...I'm deciding anything? realize I'm law maker right? I'm expressing opinion 1/3rd population possibly refuse vaccine still spread covid ignorance stupidity allowed travel planes/other public transportation countries choose allow idiots without proof vaccination. I'm sorry 2.63 million deaths world wide enough you? Try harder next reply. don’t agree anti-vax isn’t opinion, it’s stupidity. It’s like believing flat earth, shouldn’t sympathy people. Obviously medical issues literally can’t get vaccine shouldn’t punished, you’re perfectly capable willingly choose face consequences choice. shouldn’t tolerate people willingly putting people’s lives risk selfish “opinion” Damn liberals German showing 7:59 pm waiting door 8:00 party scheduled 8pm

:( High school  yes walgreens site non functional. Ive heard app may work better.  really special time 🥰 I’m pretty sure I’m done babies really enjoyed movements. Savor it. gas bubbles. 😂 actually doing. think sending 70M Q2, still tragic messaging incredibly touch. going stadiums packed tens thousands baseball fans less month, comes says ""let's hope hang close family backyard 4th!""

It's straight ignorance

It's like parent sees kid one beer pulls away saying that's enough little know they've already putting 8-10 shots night back college Yeah, low key I'm worried people outside without masks stage. started denying healthcare(emergency visits, medicine, dental) antivaxers conspiracy dipshits I'm pretty certain would change heart. Really wish fly list them. Save Drs meds people trust em. Restaurants close flu season flu vaccine usually less 60% effective can't prevent giving flu You’re right absolutely going see another outbreak lifetime might devastating mortality rate. got soooooo lucky one, imagine 10% mortality? Millions dead. think even true tbh Thanks! CDC guidelines say fully vaccinated socialize now.

Biden talking Fourth July party everyone come to, vaccinated unvaccinated alike. I'm right you. probably try find someone online within next couple weeks. Similarly, right keep bear arms (in US), right walk office start spraying bullets. people can’t get vaccinated? allergic reaction vaccination past told allergist probably forgo COVID vaccine. deed done! actual shot hurt lot less first time I'll monitoring feel It’s piece cloth dude. They’ll keep policies think it’s totally safe end them. mean time stop crying, it’s hard wear one. 

The government way restrictive policies place affect way every day I’m sure don’t get arms about... take stand public decency laws care much government telling you’re allowed wear wear public. approaching wrong abgle. company forcing put anything body. 

Companies barred discriminating certain *protected classes*, age, sex, gender, race, sexual orientation. Currently, non-vaccinated people protected class. (legally) bar employment want like beard, color hair, choice shoes, vaccinated. 

The company forcing anything body. Seriously, cannot wait get office equipment apartment back office belongs. 100 million 100 days right ?? 9-5 get 30 million number? I'm curious, that's Oh God, remember teachers used tell us allowed 'tell' bleeding hurt.

And told injured got written lying. think help lots levels nurses. nurse practitioners nurse anesthetists graduate degrees also CNAs (which guess actually nurses, people call nurses) go school 4-8 weeks, LVN/LPNs take year local community college.

""My friend nurse says Covid hoax vaccine tracker it"" may mean friend took 4 week course. original comment said ""commonly"", also pulled ass. pointing experience knowledge subject exact opposite even asked someone correct wrong. numbers based provided above, still invite anyone provide new information I'm expert.

There's need ass. I'm 18. Mental health great 2020. I've never depressed entire life. guess bright side things get better I’m big fan helping first. Companies fire using legal drugs outside work, yeah, probably could fire following specific diet. someone clarify, grandchildren (and mothers fathers) visit sets grandparents? sets grandparents fully vaccinated now.

Does fact one grandparents dental hygienist change anything (she fully vaccinated la Moderna).

Our household would household would visit (unmasked) sets grandparents. know vaccines prevent serious illness, possible get vaccinated still carry virus spread asymptomatically? get vaccinated people closely interacting unvaccinated children kids could still get inflammatory syndrome. Eligibility mean availability. bet people won’t able get appointment 2022. I'm overjoyed this, yet somehow something nagging me. failed test country, world even (with countries exception).

We head start vaccine SARS/MERS. miracle Science saving asses effective vaccine record time, pandemic potential stretch *years years*.

Next time might lucky. get wrong, I'm happy time, considering contention around wearing fucking mask, we've ***clearly*** demonstrated we're equipped handle something might evade vaccine. work vaccine clinic illinois. approximately 200k people county. since january 5th county vaccinated 20k give take. vaccine sites included.  490 yesterday every day week 8-430.  need find new job. that’s impressive amount hauling ass, longer voice feet snd back killing bending injecting/asking screening questions day.   states infrastructure right sheer number vaccines need done. it’s partly supply issue seriously three lanes vaccines single site relatively non urban county required hour wait patients two police directing traffic day line wrapped around two city blocks.     it’s bad time nurse. view, better get natural disease, get vaccine gov . 20 year old college student throws grammatically challenged $.02. we've already seen scenario play world western country ran vaccine distribution program locally lead localized outbreak. may reason uk brazilian african variants virus.

Drop donation. always schedule  U.K. bought AZ’s product produced U.K. AZ can’t sell EU they’ve already sold U.K. complicating things question exactly small gathering exactly large gathering?

A “small gathering” could two friends. “large gathering” could 100,000 people football stadium. lies between? wedding 200 people small large gathering? July 4th party 50 people small large gathering? terms fuzzy, that’s probably intentional Biden’s part. Here’s speech said: here’s point: this, part, together, July Fourth, there’s good chance you, families, friends able get together backyard neighborhood cookout barbecue celebrate Independence Day. doesn’t mean large events lots people together, mean small groups able get together.

To reads like July 4th party like one described okay. may moot, it’s likely Biden hedging (see “100 million shots 100 days”, we’re projected double). comment linking webmd.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

This exactly I’m concerned about. high school students teach starting get complacent many already recovered Covid (15% least) don’t think anything worry — they’re heading Florida hit beaches Spring Break, new variants gaining strength. realize even get vaccine still virus still pass right? even worry didn’t get vaccine begin coming work hahahaha CT tech here, better believe, jumped pfizer shot soon could, even though asthmatic allergies.

I shots. yes certian ones ar required like MMR possiblity giving little ones inthe NICU. due unknown long term effect mRNA vaccine arent required get it. flu still around, understand things work? think best years life you’re 22, you’re going shitty time holding onto thought. think we're still better-safe-than-sorry territory one. anybody hurt actions, would like express remorse. shouldnt make calculations arent capable comprehending statistics work. Could everyone please stop asking Fauci going end? I'm sure data rises statistical significance, there's strong trend actually making things worse given later progression neutral giving around typical time hospital admission.

The who's SOLIDARITY trial biggest piece research. every software developer asked come back office get vaccinated second thoughts. Meanwhile San Francisco walk vaccinations available, appointment needed.

Very strange. Ya know hear Detroit coming... need either 100% office allowing wfh

Yes crazy. tell Chancellor yet knows American elections rigged? ask details clue, thinks Biden win something someone Facebook told her. 

Not everyone uninformed is. anti vaccine crowd big America. take cues though. Sharing language big reason why. problem people want facts. want read fairy stories see conspiracies.

You cannot complete freedom complete safety. odds one another we're going make decisions soon.

The question - believe federal government perfectly understandable failings, able actually make good promise 'complete safety'? point ask given promise. Lawsuit people allowed network within company compared others level. Neither us, I've going packed bars florida since January. we've clearly demonstrated we're equipped handle something might evade vaccine.

Agree 100% – Like 2016 privileged white guy understand many racist, 2020 understand many insanely selfish. 

The last 5 years real recalibration opinion fellow Americans.  ""trust science"" peer pressure reddit anti-science thing possible. Science uses skepticism foundation scientists often wrong. got right first time, constant revisions new revelations. obviously bad thing blindly believe absurd conspiracy theories, I'm sure people freak question slightest thing rushed timeline. plenty reason reservations potential long term side effects impacts things like fertility. That’s gonna work you. I’m job I’m coming house taking shit.  30,000+ given vaccine trials notable serious adverse reactions happened. Long term side effects aren’t thing vaccinations. would apply maintenance medications take long periods time. Side effects vaccines happen initial shot short period time afterwards (12-48 hours) winter really really took tool. guessing Minneapolis? Yeah...

People always wonder survive winters cold states, roam around drunk freezing ass bar bar, get wrapped blankets watch netflix friends family day cold. tolerable even fun time year!

But remove that? Boy howdy. Felt like prison thing going constitutional crisis. Wrecked me. lot comforting information, outside friends, find google. [This article actually super helpful breaking things down. moved vaccine eligibility March 17th group.  rest title: ""... millions small ways, every day. long takes us."" It’s not. matter age 500k dead take fucking seriously. Old people matter too, man. never prevent risk aren’t trying to, live year year hundreds thousands people dying ultimately something preventable. real answer. good field get into, especially going college want put off. worked nursing home years know number RN's STNA's, exactly fall ""intelligent"" even ""friendly"" category. think bar pretty high RN days like said, many medical staff education beyond high school GED. People always skeptical understand, failure education system also case always selfish ignorant people there. Still pretty startling sounds like 30%+ healthcare workers refused vaccine nationwide. wonder hoe many people alive would otherwise died rush hour traffic.Im sure stat that. personal issue. people *unable* take vaccine legitimate medical reasons. Others *unwilling* think YouTube better source information FDA. Hygienists one risk jobs getting covid. people work dentist's office dumb. dental hygienist, really can't wrap head around that. Possibly think that’s long, long time now. hear talk “a degree normality” think means normal specific caveats. Airports airlines especially idea who’s coming going. least workplace know building. want masks “gone” end summer think it’s obvious they’re holding long time two places: airports hospitals. time they’re required places everybody moved Yeah insane, I'm even american. 

Like imagine hysteria reddit US failed vaccination rollout americans started blaming europe. started spreading bullshit claims around another country's vaccine discredit them. heard end years. People soft selfish dumb, both, keep adhering mitigation efforts couple months 

Fixed Ford Field used mass vaccination site 6000 people day starting couple weeks. might opportunity walk away building disappointed. think clear folks would exempt – and biggest reason make sure everyone else gets it. would lot receptive sacrifice they’re getting completely fucked.

Sure, that's big part it, lot people financially harmed past year also starting lose minds. like people getting antsy countries better social safety nets ours. impression well. Usually way, alarmist headline balanced article. one seems opposite. Biden specifically meant private parties okay. want limit number guests, even restrict who've taken vaccine, go right ahead. now. Public health transitioning private health. become gatekeeper arbiter safety. Exactly. They're gonna red-faced US say 'no' leaving tails legs. think old people first either essential workers age based. don’t like certain essential workers jumping line. Personally think essential workers second gonna say thing. People seem know difference employer seeking information disability health status vs requiring test vacine. 

You employees get tested recieve information medical staff.....Source weekly company 50,000+ Q told you? Immune compromised people might able vaccine affected countries morons trying travel spread it.

You realize still spread even vaccinated, right? He’s top ten scientists cited papers. doesn’t get much science him. mean COVID tracking project announced many months ago shutting March 7th tracked way hospitalizations. issue one tracking hospitalizations across country well were, everywhere else got info them. someone else needs take mantle. could honest whole time actually like hear. Maybe like news tells like. reason believe mostly done safety follow period makes reset safety follow period formality? real question?

If is, don’t ask FDA. They’re experts, all. wouldn’t wanna anti-science question experts set forth processes require *minimum* 6 months median follow up, yet met.

As reasons side effects could become issue, refer [this 2018 Potential safety concerns likely evaluated future preclinical clinical studies include local systemic inflammation, biodistribution persistence expressed immunogen, stimulation auto-reactive antibodies potential toxic effects non-native nucleotides delivery system components

I would assume things watched may immediately apparent. government right impose that, can’t think anything less American advocating government given sort power, especially given recent history. 

Btw, people try jump around saying employers imposing it. Imo that's even worse. want give power government, want give power entity democratical control either.

I'm vaccines, totalitarian ultra-capitalistic assholes two sides coin go fuck themselves. simply given would approved 6 months, would approve now, knowing would increase vaccine uptake?

Because would require changing law would simply give conspiracy nutters things complain about.

Seriously- vaccines 5th month follow millions doses given- think we’re suddenly going see bunch unexpected side-effects?

Moreover- vaccines drugs. don’t build system weird interactions drugs line. Vaccines side effects pretty much always manifest within first month two (I’m aware side effects manifested evidence happening I’d love read it). 3 longer allowed spread around un-vaccinated likely mutate turn version vaccines protect against. best interest species stop spread much possible, anti-vaxxers harm effort. also wealthier nations help poorer nations roll vaccines well. mean mandatory all.  Hey. Im least Sweet Potato .... want idiot, right one

It's also getting others sick. That's always problem.

I care Person dies they're reckless. care Person know they're sick kills Person B. Kroger overhead announcement starts ""To help control spread Virus..."" feels like part opening scene post-apocalyptic zombie movie. obvious? they've talking implementing vaccine passport fairly soon live fraction people vaccinated. working office entire time. wanna let work home underwear I’ll take it. worrisome example politization science cause people act irrationally.

I hope colds flu spread less work employers may likely encourage sick workers stay home. Sure, option fire people choosing to, correct? mean sense option fire people without cause states except protected classes antivaxx one classes. statement academic medical experts thrombosis  general concern hear speed developed, given prior development cycles. Also side effects ommited reports 'greater good'.

While get mine Im able to, there's also conversation 'evil' big pharma almost every context. take consideration people form opinions types things. completely insane 12 months later, countries still feel need resort hard lockdowns cases rising. circuitous. 

Who vaccinate first, person likely die, person might spread person likely die?

Obviously go straight source protect person likely die. WA, states problem? member associated faith long-recognized bona fide qualification working religious organizations.

Being female-presenting person breasts bona-fide occupational condition Hooters Girl, etc. 

Since vaccination inherent part person, also, think, can't bona-fide condition employment. someone could source wrong, that's great! that's extreme, think we're going lot people trying scheme system comes time work. need either 100% office allowing wfh. office someone else plays system, created inequalities. People may agree going office required, long fair hits everyone equally, can't upset things go back pre-covid. would Now. administration doesn’t magical swap humans live country. may worst outcomes TX FL
As would actively defied Biden. look countries like France see would like here, way would close to
Germany since people rebelled state government told wear masks, would 10 times worse feds it. 

Ultimately, don’t think anything would changed outcome unless locked states clear start states would challenging every done. Misleading title pharmacy area pretty crowded, walk around store 15 minutes afterwards. combination coupon brilliant part, definitely ended impulse buying things, lol thread clearly speaking generalities doctors/nurses getting vaccinated general ""conspiracy theories"" vaccine. There's nothing incorrect wrote. Never said mRNA vaccines it.

My point is, we're realizing aluminum vaccine adjuvants really, really bad health many, yet we're using since 1930s. tetanus, hep b/c vaccines more. Since used mRNA vaccines people already? Yeah. No. Sorry. lab rat makes happy it'll bank 99.93% chance survival covid. Done Covid? think it’s going away? Average redditor IQ potato. You’d ask FDA chose 6 months mandatory *minimum*. thought sub anti-science, would seem, calling FDA safety follow period “formality” they’re experts field, much anti-science. think commonly understood FDA approved widely available. Slippery slopes inherently fallacious. say someone tries heroin likely get addicted, slippery slope argument, entirely justified. understand belief, possibly seeing news cases like brother, tested negative Covid twice week prior first Moderna injection, tested positive first post injection test, within three days injection. 

He display symptoms days bedridden two weeks.

His doctor idea even contracted wears N95 mask even home, young son can't get vaccinated. There's LOT ifs there. USA allowing J&amp;J country? factor in? live, place get one local health department's office county. currently ramping mass vaccination sites starting today member counties. Everyone know got health dept. except nursing homes got pharmacies flu shots. hospitals never gave shots public.

Such hodgepodge implementation, apparently working. mean partners outside Europe better? 

After fucking response Boris Boris does: gambling. 

But end think UK still worse off, decides next months. going joint effort. Anything states willing do, federal government let them. federal government supplement capacity. separate both, nothing really replace ability hospital systems, pharmacies, primary care physicians vaccinate existing patients, especially rural areas mass vaccination site make sense. There’s probably pretty large discrepancies vaccine hesitancy states, see differing demand rural urban within states. it’s higher 30% cant export vaccine dont have, thats point; used. none spare. concerns this. get shot due auto-immunity doctor informed could cause harm received vaccine. I'm far anti-vaccer. Im also great health person risk category Covid. Sooooooooo happens me? 89 year old grandpa gave us big hug saw us back October. vaccine status need private? I’m immune compromised. asked nurse last appointment able get vaccine. said no, satisfied tested 3 days week waiting herd immunity. Fuck her. point plan asking restaurants concert venues policy proving vaccination. one I'll tell goodbye, write goodbye Yelp page. answer require showing vaccination card seated, get business big tip. airlines/cruise ships/Red Sox games/etc.

I plan getting vaccination card laminated get second dose. People really need punished compromising health infirm favor stupidity ignorance. Right absolutely is, work hospital estimate would say least 25% staff vaccinated. hot topic mandated discuss matter even ask others vaccinated screaming matches whole thing. gather three years mandate vaccine, hope far behind us hard sell employers mandate, many mandate flu shots currently? forced get one every year take 4 month unpaid vacation flu season. happy get COVID vaccine hard get inside heads people won't. can't come work cold. Covid _DoNt TrEaD mE_. GM actually recently manager; gave extra day punishment. usually getting one day week, anyway hiring two three more. hurt 3days losing day pay. learn lesson trying teach Yah honestly office culture really need exist online go smoothly. need nice coworkers. lot people hate team building events, real team building getting blackout coworkers. source where? tell us?

I don’t know chose 6 fact- tell us clinical trial ""starts""? seem expert all.

Sure! answer one. 6 months trial starts. 6 months *median* follow up. Meaning, first dose Phase 3 trial went arm 2010, wouldn’t count “started” - FDA wants see *median* dose received least 6 months Part reason 6 months used trials generally involve smaller number people want allow enough time even rare side-effects manifest.

I’m following. Time people interchangeable. trial 2,000 people waits 6 months, would catch common latent side effects rare immediate ones say, incidence 1 10,000. hand trial 1,000,000 participants 1 day follow would catch rare immediate side effects, common delayed ones.

And okay well guess disagree. Given seriousness pandemic, don’t think FDA would refuse fully approve vaccine formality only. You’re free think otherwise.

EUA full approval aren’t even bar treatment pass. Papers, Comrade? mid-level managers gotta manage make sure desk all, droning away like compliant slave are. 

No thanks, overall output equal greater office. suffer minimal mindless office chatter zoom meetings, several additional hours day exercise, work projects, watch kids grow day day basis. know, get human again. Yeah insane, I’m pretty sure ACEN requirement nursing programs require basic science courses labs science degrees also get. nursing easy didn’t require real science classes would definitely attrition rate many programs have, people glad requirements ton highly questionable people never even make programs cannot pass a&amp;p. I’m saying ostracizing people won’t get vaccine way order make consent consent. Ethically it’s massive worms. I’m saying don’t get booster. I’m saying likelihood massive escape variant 200x ability attach ACE2 receptor astronomical low 100% fear mongering unless proof, still haven’t provided source case. 

Unless escapes vaccine, point booster accommodate variants getting protective efficacy high possible. antibody activity shown Pfizer lab still enough neutralize ever major known variant varying degrees, neutralize nonetheless. many die lockdowns

Significantly less would died without lockdowns. Sorry tolerant ideas.

Oh no, poor victim. really matter contractual party executive legislative powers. business giving us 4 hours PTO $100. I'm curious see works. get 2 hours extra sleep everyday commuting save $500 month. “Opportunities team building collaboration/get interrupted” aren’t worth giving that. [COVID-19 passes heart disease become L.A. County’s top allegation Biden promised $2000 got $600. lie. promised $2000 got $600 checks. linked first one everyone else would said “it’s $600 + $1400 = $2000” fact promised $2000 top $600 started reeling back right Georgia run election.

I’ve seen enough though. Biden shown represent goals left. Liberals shown much better conservatives. future supporting democratic candidates state federal level.  obligations others, freedoms yourself

This patently unequivocally false. takes 6 months? Pfizer wasn’t even part warp speed. Sure people restricted plan? 

We want make doctor's office safe unvaccinated people. somebody can't get vaccine works doctor's office, they'd restricted work.  Welp, looks like California's going permanent mask mandates all, even ""green tier"" vaccinations widespread: knew it, nice knowing you. “It really evolution, real time, understanding something never experienced before,” said. hates asked future. “There many moving targets.” Despite snippets make headlines sound bites, America’s famous pandemic expert extremely reluctant make predictions “returning normal” specific time.

The answer is, actually, don’t know,” said, calling car TV appearances. live rural PA county, gotten anywhere close enough vaccines. 10% 1A eligible candidates able get it, slightly less 5k total residents, 1k teachers school district staff. No, like ""document"" ""title"" recognized within EU, drug academic degree. study says vaccine effective vaccine approved. God, feels good Michigander today. Checks abortion laws... 

Hmmmm doesn’t quite check expectation revaccinate years come? danish pm record stating WI becoming RN 2 year associate’s degree didn’t. threw money like major companies. Pfizer said wound first anyway. part! I've noticed better work/life balance I'm home full-time. Before, day went sideways deal something stressful EOD, frustration awful afternoon commute would compound stress. day turn computer go hang dog literally whatever else except sit car 40-60+ minutes. That’s valid I’m sorry. district went virtual last spring back person since summer. Whereas many schools still shut down. prioritized everything done since pandemic began:( Nobody asked me. Sounds good me! Keep pissing bottles, Amazon Employees! Presidential polls operate within margin error seem think it’s right control put body refuse put body. sure got idea. *quotes half sentence continues prove wrong* still 30s  Imagine letting career epidemiologists explain risk contracting deadly virus. cares poindexter knows germs right? large amount companies lack trust, consideration, creativity needed fully transition remote-only.

One thing always hear culture severely impacted everybody's ""far away,"" that's narrow-minded bullshit. usually comes orgs definition ""culture"" ping-pong tables, beer kegs, office Nerf wars (oMg LiKe SoOoO CoOl!).

I've jobhunting pretty steadily two months now, job market open ever, pretty telling companies remote thing well - ones half-assing hopes going back in-person premises.  Isn’t like 95% effective? add that, typically highly unlikely case given expected short window immunity even ignoring mammals getting it.  Incentivize people getting vaccine like... allowing work company?  Best way go apply controls pressure degree

That's they've ultimately, put situation real legal power anything, contract weak, there's meaningful actions take stage. Really idea thinking made contract. still said anything I've done statistically incorrect. claiming stats incorrect prove it.

I'm trolling look numbers yourself. Sorry tolerant ideas. Research public health fluff? hard science?

At point ""FDA Approved"" matter long-term effects unknown? already covid *FIRE HOSE* I'm antidepressants as-needed anxiety pills first time life (probably gone years ago, eh.) many ways lot privilege - kept apartment, modest financial safety net, fully unemployed months able get unemployment checks, freelance computer home, parents still alive fully vaccinated. hand Italy found Patient Zero lived first weeks growing panic right middle first Western outbreak, came home NYC literally last flight Italy time chaos hit home city listen sirens 24/7, got separated different-nationality partner tragedy family border bans letting back (will full year apart soon), grandmothers died three months apart (of not-covid still like blinked existence, funeral wake anything), lived seven months absolute hell loved one hospitalized seven months worst case covid doctors ever seen, waking every morning stomachache reaching phone terror, person eventually passed away. 


Some days I'm totally fine, antidepressants done I've needed years, spring coming, I'm making repeated attempts build healthy habits become successful. days just......can't get single goddamn thing accomplished newsworthy manage shower wash dishes. brain foggy forget stupid shit, misplace things like never used do, attention span half used feel just....running juice attempt anything mentally taxing. 


I hate want know I'll go back normal eventually. (I never covid, long covid.)  false, required chemistry, anatomy, physiology, biology, microbiology, classes ones med students take required labs definitely online, nursing accreditation US schools require types classes. Sure lot theory classes online later degrees, nursing curriculum requires class participation rigorous testing simulation/clinical experience. could quit rather hand tater tots.  bitching about? Would rather others make choice closing business? Yeah well majority Americans support lot sound mind policies government still functions like potato can't pass legislation benefit people also brought best others. saw Scouts learn sew make face masks hospitals. saw high school kids visit windows shut elderly people elders could see human face. still believe every obnoxious jerk pandemic outed person somewhere something awesome someone else. fuck don't. surveys? lol propaganda machine workin baby. Unless Janssen able remove round trip US order supply EU, aspirational. likely number US involved 0 Q3. That's called medical coersion violates medical ethics.

How coercion? already require covid tests many activities. People still choose get tested that’s want- get vaccinated. It’s Given vaccines' average effectiveness 60-90%

Why giving range average? talking averages vaccine Pfizer Moderna vaccines actually greater 90%.

And vaccine approved use US efficacy Again, question asked: worth putting undue pressure vaccine opt-outs, given little change overall population immunity?

Several reasons:

1- Every unvaccinated person still risk.

2- Whenever allow opt-outs tend wind pockets unvaccinated people. overall number high enough herd immunity- it’s far low pockets end seeing outbreaks.

3- anyone allowed opt-out protecting fellow citizens? Either vaccine completely safe reason opt-opt- risk want benefits vaccination without take risk. want eat cake too. Why? Vaccinated people still transmit disease. brainer. incentivises getting vaccine also protect us all. mention could literally start re-opening much stuff like 1 month vaccinated take full advantage (Movie Theathers, bars, restaurants - obviously open extent think business would start better understood fully vaccinated people there). PA two years obtaining 4 year degree essential workers eligible March 22nd... literally nothing distribution. Yes, 0.85 good: means 15% drop cases per 5 days. going months UK.

Uh, cases dropped 84%, that's bad wording; they've dropped 84% (so -16% per 5 days). PLEASE, can’t wait till Biden gets rid bullshit tiers actually stop wasting vaccine get people enthusiastically take instead working though tiers people don’t even show appointments 20% time. Sounds like socialism pal. I’ll pass. rushed vaccine history likely underdeveloped. Wonder they’re gonna people like don’t get vaccinated. Reuters already foreshadowing whats come article... hope stand people’s freedom control bodies comes it. Exactly. well versed exact science vaccine , overall aware new vaccine method. old method , applied new virus. virus behave like typical virus. 

I need lay blame anywhere, messaging around vaccine needs clearer safety aspect. 
My mom completely understood coming ( explained said ) lot fears mixed messaging combined general apathy towards doctors. Except cancer doesn’t 99% survival rate. stay indoors every single man women child vaccinated, verified e government they’re vaccinated, vaccinated strain 1, vaccinated strain 2, vaccinated again.. get stay home don’t social

/s

At point we’re gonna take risk open fully. us arnt autistic want office interact people privacy even rights bodies

If institute personal liability spread vaccine, I'm fine letting folks get it. 

But status quo right there's ramifications simply believe science, based nothing conspiratorial thinking. That's OK. No, mean there's obviously difference. much private information already available government corporations is. Also smartphone thing actually happening now, forced vaccinations exist country.

In end think anybody US vaccinations forced them. Nobody stop drunk, laws public intoxication drunk driving. It'll thing. 40 minutes way, twice day five days week comes 400 minutes week. 

Counting PTO holidays, take 5ish weeks year off. 400 times 47 weeks means 18,800 minutes year.

That's 313 hours (and change). 13 full days. Although part decent walk, I'll admit miss. even walking alone outside? What? That’s insane scientifically backed all. phrase problem scared unvaxxed person received 95% effective vaccine prevents death &amp; hospitlization close 100% - people rightly ridicule ridiculous.

Why?

Do know live with? immune compromised? think taking 1% risk death family member period of, say, month someone negligent sociopath principle matter

What principle? desire pretend actions affect others? slight convenience supercedes life collective action problem people need part enough people choose like guy, problem persist society wide level.

This contradicts earlier sentiments. collective action problem requires care spreading global pandemic even believe personally safe willing take whatever perceive risk health.  Doubt it. get vaccine don’t tell anyone. It’s like office access whether got not. Thst would one friends. Nurse majority life rejected flu COVID vaccines. Covid vaccine gave dumb ass reasons quickly found BS. Don’t know falls it. still going stop steal blaming Biden every single issue going on. husband bad. He’s boot wanting put gun turrets border keep illegals here. Damn DeWine, step 32 - fond memories college days, look back realize mostly naivety lack real world experience made days comfortable. Going job market afterwards huge kick balls.

Knowing know now, college mindset would different day 1. science related field, Exactly, mandate covid vaccine work, imagine employees get mad colleague sickness/diseases contagious well, still working side side. 

HPV/HIV/STDs, dont require sex trade lol. Neither covid. Make get covid vaccine work office, allow HPV positive person spread HPV simply ""spitting"" (accident course) ... obviously stupid extreme, guaranDamnTee sure people sue train sailed decided provide handwritten unverifiable vaccination cards “proof” vaccination. Even though gone 50 days without kind press conference. US might perfect democracy, flawed one, democracy nonetheless. chinese democracy, even flawed one. I'm argentinian, country lot LOT experience dictatorships totalitarianism, assure democracy even flaws trumps dictatorships. Besides roles shifted, US longer supporting dictatorships region, China is, like venezuela. That's would prefer american european influence rather chinese influence.  got Janssen vaccine, nuts seriously cramping. Absolutely. I’ve also saved money replenishing makeup gas, even staple wardrobe items really think it. also saving much making healthier, tastier breakfasts lunches myself. Yeah, it’s unfortunate seeing nursing assistants area post facebook won’t get vaccine people trust they’re “in medical field.”

But reality got CNA 18 still high school that’s they’ve done since. kind continuing education anything science medicine-related little got high school.

I also took one-semester course high school qualified go get certified CNA turned 18, didn’t interest kind nursing job.

If there’s one thing course/the clinical hours taught me, it’s really don’t bright order change someone’s clothes wipe asses. Also probably many wound kids could care for. Eh could still way worse year — next pandemic could hit children elementary school. I’m first group I’m frustrated point despair society’s tolerance risk seems dropped dramatically. word “safe” become trigger me. feel need inform every redditor countries to, especially 24 hours, country unless something specific on-topic say it. fact immediate response paint people clearly care Dubai envious going Dubai makes look even like trying brag. personally, reason care Dubai human rights, care fake landscape popped lifetime. separation biggest thing me. first ~6 months WFH really motivated best separate work time time. time went line started blur like September January 2021 completely unproductive. I've back full time work since January since entire division vaccinated motivation work boosted significantly again. Eh, plenty non homeless goobers wearing neck T. Yesterday old guy straight said I’m wearing one CVS didn’t get push back. Still lot better places though allowed hug anyone want hug, long okay fact hug might kill them. Honestly, satisfaction lot what’s getting this. don’t use social media outside Reddit, either, people haven’t even really seen pictures. It’s gonna cool make wait worth it.

Congrats you, man! one summer got taken doesn’t mean can’t live 2021. SW? Yeah what's fine lying whether vaccinated less cost commute? rent someones grandma Yeah, I'm quieter side hanging people love it. However, I've hanging awhile days row I'll probably need day room talking anybody Dangit, came post ha! believe company 19 countries ? absolutely  What’s solution? Hurrah! Thanks pointing out! getting worried that, great worries proven wrong!  That's good point! Could be! psycho hitler shit right here.
